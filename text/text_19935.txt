BACKGROUND
entamoeba histolytica is the protozoon responsible for up to  <dig>  deaths each year  <cit> . only 10% of infected people present disease symptoms expressed in intestinal or extraintestinal amoebiasis. the molecular mechanisms participating in the parasite invasiveness are not completely understood. diverse populations of e. histolytica, including clones derived from a particular strain, display different virulence phenotype  <cit> . in addition, long-time cultured trophozoites, which show poor capacity to produce liver abscesses in experimental animals, recover their virulence after incubation with cholesterol or with certain types of bacteria, or after their passage by hamster livers  <cit> . this behavior could be due to changes in expression of certain genes. in fact, trophozoites isolated from infected animals present changes in gene expression with respect to trophozoites cultured in the laboratory  <cit> . it has been also shown that trophozoite interaction with human collagen type i and ca2+ triggers transcription of virulence related molecules as the amoebapore c, the cysteine proteinase  <dig> and a cdc48-like protein  <cit> .

in contrast to other eukaryotes, transcription of e. histolytica protein-coding genes is insensitive to high concentrations of alpha-amanitin  <cit> . in addition, certain promoters of protein-coding genes present three unusual motifs in their 5'-flanking region  <cit> :  the gtatttaaa sequence, which corresponds to the tata box;  the aaagaact sequence, named gaac element; and  the initiator aaaattca sequence . furthermore, five upstream regulatory elements  were identified in the promoter of the galactose-inhibitable lectin heavy subunit gene hgl <dig>  <cit> . additionally, the structural and functional characterization of promoters driving the expression of ehpgp <dig> and ehpgp <dig> genes, whose products are implicated in the multidrug-resistance event, revealed that they contain motifs with homology to cis-regulatory elements of eukaryotic cells  <cit> .

vesicular trafficking plays an important role in the pathogenic mechanism of e. histolytica, because it participates in secretion of virulence factors and in the internalization of host cells. in eukaryotes, vesicular trafficking is regulated by rab gtpases, which by cycling between active  and inactive  conformations act as molecular switches that integrate several events at each step of vesicular transport  <cit> . thus, rab proteins may be involved in the e. histolytica pathogenicity. ehrabb is a rab gtpase located in small vesicles that in wild-type trophozoites are translocated to plasma membrane and to phagocytic mouths during phagocytosis  <cit> , whereas, in trophozoites deficient in phagocytosis most of these vesicles remain in the cytoplasm  <cit> . in addition, marion et al.  <cit> , using a proteomic approach, described that ehrabb is among the proteins identified during early phagocytosis. although ehrabb was not identified in independent phagosome protomics studies using carboxylated latex beads  <cit> , those results suggest that ehrabb participates in phagocytosis, an event related to the e. histolytica pathogenicity  <cit> .

the ehrabb gene is located close to the ehcp <dig> and ehadh <dig> genes, whose products form the ehcpadh complex, also involved in the parasite pathogenic mechanism  <cit> . these three genes spans a  <dig> bp region named virulence locus   <cit> , providing a good model to study gene transcription regulation of virulence-related genes. the ehrabb gene is situated  <dig> bp upstream of the ehcp <dig> gene, but in the complementary strand  <cit> . some of the cis-elements that control the ehadh <dig> and ehcp <dig> transcription are located inside the open reading frame of ehcp <dig> and ehrabb, respectively  <cit> . however, the cis-acting sequences which might be relevant to drive the ehrabb gene expression have not been identified yet.

to elucidate the molecular mechanisms controlling ehrabb gene expression, we studied here the structural and functional characteristics of its promoter. our analyses revealed that it has several transcription initiation sites. we also detected the presence of one region that represses and one motif that activates ehrabb transcription. interestingly, the gene promoter has regulatory heat shock elements that under heat shock stress activate ehrabb transcription.

RESULTS
structural analysis of the 5'-flanking region of ehrabb
the proximity of ehrabb and ehcp <dig> genes and their opposite transcription, suggest a finely regulated gene expression of these two genes. to initiate the comprehension of the mechanisms involved in their transcription, we studied here the ehrabb promoter region, comprising from the start codon to - <dig> bp upstream of this site. in this region we looked for:  consensus sequences described in e. histolytica core promoters  <cit> ;  sequences with similarity to the ure <dig> to ure <dig> elements  <cit> ; and  consensus sequences described for binding of eukaryotic transcription factors.

neither e. histolytica inr elements nor tata-box sequences were identified in the ehrabb promoter region. in contrast, we detected a sequence similar to the gaac element at  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the start codon . the absence of inr and tata box consensus sequences suggests that there is a particular unknown transcription initiation mechanism for ehrabb. our search also revealed a sequence located at - <dig> to - <dig> that is  <dig> % identical to the ure <dig> sequence described as a transcriptional activator of the hgl <dig> gene  <cit>  . the analysis also showed the presence of three c/ebp, one gata- <dig> and seven heat shock elements  consensus sequences in this region .

determination of the ehrabb transcription start site
the ehrabb gene transcription initiation site was mapped by primer extension experiments using a -labeled 18-bp antisense oligonucleotide that spans from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides inside the gene open reading frame. as often found in tata-less promoters  <cit> , ehrabb gene exhibited several transcription initiation sites located at - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  with respect to its start codon . the adenine residue located at the start of the shortest ehrabb transcript was arbitrarily designed as position + <dig> . the aaaagaaga+ <dig> sequence, where this transcript starts, differs from the consensus sequence described for the transcription initiation site  of the majority of e. histolytica genes  <cit> . on the other hand, the gaac element, a c/ebp site and two hse sequences found by in silico searches appeared situated downstream of the first transcription initiation site , but we do not know yet their relevance in transcriptional activity.

most of the e. histolytica genes examined so far have a short  5' untranslated region   <cit> . ehrabb as other few e. histolytica transcripts  <cit>  have long 5'utr, which could have a specific role in translation regulation  <cit> . the shortest 5'utr of ehrabb is composed of  <dig> nucleotides, whereas the longest has  <dig> nucleotides and the ehcp <dig> transcript, which runs in opposite direction, has a  <dig> nucleotides 5'utr  <cit> . on the other hand, the ehrabb start codon is located at  <dig> bp upstream of the ehcp <dig> start codon, thus, both transcripts overlap in at least  <dig> nucleotides . this act supports the hypothesis that expression of ehrabb and ehcp <dig> genes are co-regulated.

delimitation and characterization of the ehrabb gene promoter and its relevant motifs
the active regions of ehrabb gene promoter were characterized in trophozoites transfected with the pbscat-act vector  <cit>  in which we cloned dna fragments containing  <dig> bp downstream of the first transcription initiation site and distinct lengths fragments of the upstream region. the larger fragment , containing the gata- <dig> , c/ebp , ure <dig> , and hse  sequences, showed only  <dig> ± 1% cat activity of the one exhibited by actin gene promoter  <cit> , used here as a control . interestingly, in prab <dig> plasmid , where three out of five hse motifs present were deleted, cat activity augmented in 41% with respect to prab <dig>  being  <dig> ± 17% of the actin gene promoter . the construction prab <dig> , where the ure <dig>  and other hse  were eliminated, showed  <dig> ± 6% cat activity with respect to activity displayed by the actin promoter , whereas prab <dig>  and prab <dig>  constructions, displayed  <dig> ± 5% and  <dig> ± 4% cat activity, respectively . these results showed that: i) the c/ebp  and gata- <dig>  sequences may not be relevant for ehrabb gene transcription, because their removal did not show significant effect in cat activity; ii) a dna region located between positions - <dig> to - <dig> negatively controls ehrabb transcription; and iii) a dna fragment located at - <dig> to - <dig>  where a hse and a ure <dig> motifs were detected, activates ehrabb transcription.

due to the distance between ehrabb and ehcp <dig> genes and to their transcription in opposite directions  is probable that our constructs could display transcription from the opposite strand to the reporter gene, producing an antisense rna that possibly affect the promoter assays, and differences in cat activity between prab <dig> and prab <dig> could be due to variations in the antisense level. to investigate if antisense rna of the cat reporter gene is transcribed in the transfected trophozoites, we carried out strand-specific rt-pcr assays. in both constructs , rt-pcr assays produced the expected fragment when we used oligo or antisense primers to synthesize cdna, whereas no amplification was obtained when a sense primer was utilized , indicating that antisense rna is not produced in the transfectants. these results revealed that transcriptional differences observed in transfected trophozoites are due to promoter activities, and they are according with those obtained on the transcriptional analysis of the ehcp <dig> gene  <cit> , which demonstrated that the  <dig> bp intergenic region between ehcp <dig> and ehrabb is not able to promote the ehcp <dig> transcription, and that sequences driving the ehcp <dig> transcription are located inside the coding region of ehrabb . in our constructs this region was replaced by the cat reporter gene, consequently the sequences driving the transcription of antisense rna are absent.

delimitation of the repressor region in ehrabb gene promoter
according with our analyses, in the dna fragment that inhibits ehrabb transcription  we did not identify consensus transcription repressor sequences described in other systems. thus, to delimitate the cis-elements that negatively control ehrabb transcription, we performed sequential deletions between position - <dig> and - <dig>  different length fragments were again cloned into the pbscat-act vector and transfected into trophozoites, then, cat activities were measured . in construction comprising from - <dig> to + <dig> nt  cat activity was  <dig> ± 3% of prab <dig>  and the prab <dig>  showed a dramatic drop of activity  . these experiments indicated that the  <dig> bp region located between positions - <dig> to - <dig> contains transcription inhibitors. in this region we only detected a hse element .

emsa experiments using a  <dig> bp dna probe containing nucleotides form - <dig> to - <dig> confirmed the presence of nuclear proteins interacting with this region. results showed the formation of three dna-protein complexes  that were competed by 150-fold excess of the same cold-probe, but remained in the presence of 350-fold excess of the nonspecific competitor , indicating that dna-protein interactions were specific. the complexes formation strengthened the hypothesis that this region has a functional repressor activity in ehrabb gene promoter.

delimitation of the activator region in ehrabb gene promoter
to delimitate the cis-elements that activate the ehrabb transcription, we generated constructions with sequential deletions between position - <dig> and - <dig> that were cloned into the pbscat-act vector . activity exhibited by extracts from trophozoites transfected with plasmids prab <dig> , prab <dig> , and prab <dig>  decreased to  <dig> to 44% of activity displayed by the prab <dig> plasmid . constructions with additional different deletions did show similar cat activity than prab <dig>  these experiments indicated that cis-elements that activate ehrabb gene transcription are located between positions - <dig> to - <dig> nt. in this region we identified a sequence  with  <dig> % identity to ure <dig> sequence described for the hgl <dig> gene promoter  <cit>  and one putative hse motif  .

emsa experiments using nuclear extracts and the  <dig> bp dna fragment comprising from - <dig> to - <dig> revealed that two dna-protein complexes are formed in this region. complexes were competed by 150-fold excess of the same cold-sequence, but not by the presence of 350-fold excess of the nonspecific competitor . complexes formation supported the hypothesis that in this dna fragment are situated cis-elements involved in ehrabb transcription activation.

role of the ure1-like sequence in the ehrabb transcription
the  <dig> bp fragment between - <dig> and - <dig> activates transcription, forms complexes with some nuclear proteins and contains a sequence that has nine out eleven base pairs identical to the ure <dig> motif of hgl <dig> . to analyze the role of the ure1-like sequence in ehrabb promoter activity, we deleted  <dig> bp containing this sequence and cloned a dna fragment from - <dig> to + <dig> in front of the cat reporter gene  . this construct only exhibited  <dig> ± 4% cat activity of prab <dig> that includes the ure1-like sequence . our results show that the ure1-like sequence located from - <dig> to - <dig> bp is a cis-activating element of ehrabb transcription.

we also carried out emsa experiments using the dna fragment containing from - <dig> to - <dig> bp as a probe. two dna-protein complexes were detected in these assays . both complexes were competed by a 150-fold excess of the same cold sequence, but they were not competed by a 150-fold excess of a nonspecific competitor with similar base composition to ure <dig>  but mingled sequence . interestingly, when we used as competitor a fragment containing the ure <dig> sequence from the hgl <dig> promoter, complexes were competed and they disappeared . moreover, two dna-protein complexes with similar mobility were detected when this sequence was used as a probe . these results evidenced that similar nuclear factor recognized the ure <dig> sequence of the hgl <dig> gene promoter and the ure1-like sequence present in ehrabb gene promoter.

effect of heat shock on ehrabb gene transcription
comparative analyses of the 5'-flanking region of genes induced by heat shock have revealed that they contain tracts with three or more ngaan or nttcn sequences, which are essential for heat induction response  <cit> . these tracts are called hse and the presence of multiple hse can act in a cooperative way. as mentioned before, in the ehrabb 5'-flanking region we found seven putative hses, five of them situated upstream of the first start transcription site  and the two other at + <dig> to + <dig> and + <dig> to + <dig> . to prove that they have a functional role in the ehrabb transcription, we used the construction prab <dig>  that includes all these sequences  to transfect e. histolytica. its ability to drive cat expression was measured  <dig> and  <dig> h after trophozoites incubation at 42°c. cat enzymatic activity augmented approximately twice on heat shocked trophozoites with respect to the activity displayed by cells maintained at 37°c . our results indicate that hse motifs present into the ehrabb gene promoter could be functional under heat shock stress.

on the other hand, to verify the effect of heat shock in ehrabb gene transcription, we performed real-time rt-pcr assays using rna isolated from trophozoites maintained at 37°c or from trophozoites incubated  <dig> h at 42°c. in concordance with cat assays, trophozoites under heat shock presented a five-fold increase of ehrabb transcription in comparison with those grown at 37°c . these results support the hypothesis that under heat shock of trophozoites the hse sequences found in the ehrabb gene promoter regulate the transcription of this gene. it is possible that these elements also regulate the gene transcription under other stimuli such as oxidative stress, during invasion, or stress induced by anti-e. histolytica drugs. however, this assumption needs to be proved.

gene expression analysis by microarray assays revealed that heat shock treatment of e. histolytica trophozoites induce the expression of virulence-related genes such as the cysteine proteases  <dig> and  <dig>  and specific alleles of the gal/galnac lectin  <cit> . in addition, some rab gtpases are upregulated under stress conditions in other organisms  <cit> , indicating that these proteins may play an important role in cell adaptation to stress, beyond their housekeeping function in intracellular vesicle trafficking. in saccharomyces cervisiae the hse sequences are also involved in the transcription induction not only of heat shock proteins  but also of genes encoding proteins involved in diverse cellular processes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we showed here that the ehrabb gene is transcriptionally activated by heat shock and that the ehrabb gene promoter contains cis-elements that repress and activate the gene transcription on normal conditions. the cis-activating element corresponds to a ure1-like sequence, whereas de cis-repressive element remains to be identified.
