BACKGROUND
it is very unlikely that proteins interact randomly with their molecular environment. water, the most ubiquitous and abundant molecule of life, certainly plays a major role in controlling intermolecular interactions among biomolecules. to understand the interactions in specific protein surface regions that trigger biological functions requires an accurate delineation of protein hydration dynamics.

protein hydration at the atomic level can be investigated using a variety of independent techniques such as molecular dynamics  simulations  <cit> , high resolution x-ray crystallography  <cit>  and nmr spectroscopy. nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion  studies seem to be particularly suited to determining the number of water molecules that are tightly bound to proteins  <cit> , but cannot provide information at atomic resolution per se. in principle, a detailed spatial distribution of water molecules that exhibit long residence times can be defined from hydration nmr experiments based on cross-relaxation  <cit> , by analyzing the water-protein overhauser effect  arising from selective water excitation. pulsed field gradients, generated by standard hardware, are included in ephogsy-type sequences  <cit>  limiting typical artifacts due to selective pulses  <cit> . general developments of high resolution hydration nmr experiments have been critically reviewed  <cit>  and signals observed in ephogsy-type spectra have been predicted also from chemical exchange or relayed overhauser effects. indeed, as suggested in the pioneering work of wüthrich and co-workers  <cit> , relayed water-protein overhauser effects s) cannot be measured separately from noewps  <cit> . the noes expected from all the amino acids bearing exchangeable hydrogens on their side chains are also propagated to hydrogens that are spatially close to the exchangeable side-chain hydrogen atoms. because the amino acid side chains that bear the exchangeable hydrogen atoms are also the ones which are most frequently involved in the binding of water molecules  <cit> , the interpretation of ephogsy signals in terms of protein hydration seems to be limited to only very few cases  <cit> . it has been suggested  <cit>  that a partial solution to the latter problem could be to compare the hydration patterns obtained from nmr studies and from md simulations. a convergence of the computationally and experimentally derived hydration data could provide mutual validation.

md simulations have indicated that strong hydration sites are not found in surface regions where protein hot spots are present  <cit> . this result is of primary relevance to predictions of the functional properties of protein surfaces. ephogsy nmr studies have experimentally confirmed the absence of strong hydration sites at protein active sites  <cit> . furthermore, as recently reviewed  <cit> , a tight correlation exists between the absence of md derived high water density sites and surface regions highly accessible to paramagnetic probes  <cit> .

the  <dig> aminoacids long dna binding protein, sso7d, from the extreme thermophilic crenarchaeon sulfolobus solfataricus supports multiple and structurally well-defined activities  <cit>  making it a good model protein for analyzing the relationship between solvent dynamics, surface accessibility and biological function. because sso7d binds different substrates, such as nucleic acids, atp and misfolded/unfolded proteins  <cit> , as a model, it offers a unique opportunity to investigate how the different ligand molecules can adopt their own approach to bind to their targets on the protein surface. sso7d surface accessibility has previously been studied using paramagnetic probes that preferentially accessed the specific surface regions where interactions with dna and misfolded/unfolded proteins occurred  <cit> . the finding that some surface-exposed regions of sso7d were equally inaccessible to tempol and gd has been ascribed to the presence of tightly bound water molecules  <cit> .

the hydration of sso7d and the homologous protein sac7d from sulfolobus acidocaldarius has been analyzed from crystal structures of dna-protein complexes  <cit> . in these complexes, four water molecules that were differently arranged in a diamond shape were found at the interface between sso7d/sac7d and the bound dna. the four water molecules were apparently acting as a molecular filler to optimize protein-dna binding. a series of conserved water molecules, including those that were involved in the sso7d atpase activity, were also observed. the structural stability of sso7d  <cit> , prevented major conformational changes of the protein backbone within the md simulation timescale and allowed protein hydration investigations to be carried out using the md hydration site  approach  <cit> . in the present work, sso7d hydration was studied using md simulations and ephogsy nmr spectroscopy to identify correlations between solvent dynamics and the functional features encoded in the protein surface.

RESULTS
structural alignment
two solution structures of free sso7d  <cit>  and three crystal structures of the protein complexed with different dna fragments  <cit>  are available in the protein data bank  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the complexed forms of sso7d are very similar, particularly in the protein/dna binding region. high similarity between the two nmr structures is also apparent, confirming that only small differences in orientation and packing of backbone and side chain groups are allowed in the sso7d crystal structures. the mean global rmsd calculated for the backbone atoms of the five structures, excluding four disordered residues at the c-terminus and met <dig>  was only  <dig>  nm. however, to minimize artifacts due to initial local conformations, one solution structure and one crystal structure have been used as the reference structures for the two md simulations .

molecular dynamics simulation
to minimize biased contributions from the sso7d reference structures to the dynamics of the surface water molecules, two  <dig> ns md simulations in explicit water were carried out using one crystal structure  and one solution structure . from each md trajectory the solvent density map was computed and the maxima of the mdhs  <cit>  are given in figure  <dig>  quantitative correlation of the two density maps was computed with a coefficient of  <dig>  at the density threshold used in figure  <dig>  while a comparison of mdhs and conserved water molecules from the three crystal structures  is shown in figure  <dig> 

the average residence time  for the water molecules was computed for both md trajectories according to the method described by de simone and coworkers  <cit> . a similar distribution of the residence times between the two was apparent , except in the range from  <dig> ns onward; this result will be discussed later. significantly for the comparison, the monotonic decrease was interrupted in both cases in the 600- <dig> ps range. the same distributions were used to choose cut-off values for clustering the times into short , intermediate , long  and very long  ranges based on their relative populations. this clustering was used to map the obtained τ values onto the sso7d structure . as observed for the sso7d mdhs, the τ profiles obtained from md trajectories using the nmr and x-ray reference structures show significant similarities, although some discrepancies were apparent. in particular, the second half of the segment in the first β-sheet spanning residues phe <dig> to lys <dig> and the segment  at the beginning of the c-terminal helix show very longer τ values  when the nmr structure is used for the md simulation . this finding can be ascribed to the diminished secondary structure content in these two protein regions during the nmr based md simulation, see additional file  <dig>  the incomplete closure of secondary structure elements can lead to a lack of structural constraints in the nmr derived structure that can cause protein backbone amide and carbonyl groups to trap water molecules and form water bridged h-bonds. despite these potentially misleading artifacts, the general agreement between the two md simulation results was apparent because all the other minor differences could be ascribed to the expected simulation noise. to further assess the general convergence of the two md simulations, the τ computation was independently repeated on each half of the two trajectories. the results were clustered as described above and the distribution profiles for the four data sets showed good agreement .

the md results indicate that:  the simulation procedures that were used are reliable, because, independently from the reference structure used for the md run, the sso7d surface presents similar mdhs distributions and similar τ values; and  because all the water molecules that were conserved in the crystal structures overlap with the mdhs, the hydration site predictions are accurate .

ephogsy nmr measurements
intermolecular nuclear overhauser effects between sso7d and water were generated using ephogsy pulse sequences  <cit> . in such experiment, signals are obtained only for those protein hydrogens in close contact with the protons of resident water molecules. this is achieved by zeroing the intramolecular noe signals by dephasing the protein magnetization, while water resonance through selective inversion before the noe mixing time is preserved, thus yielding only intermolecular water-protein noe signals. by adding classical nmr building blocks, the basic 1d ephogsy experiments can be expanded to multidimensional and multinuclear types such as 2d noesy, 2d tocsy and15n-hsqc to improve signal dispersion. as shown in figure  <dig>  in the 2d ephogsy-tocsy spectrum with noe, many signals were present. 1d and 2d ephogsy spectra containing noe and roe effects were compared to discriminate signals from direct chemical exchange from signals arising from noewp or noe  <cit> . a total of  <dig> signals have been ascribed either to noewp or to noe . distinguishing between noewps and noes is not an easy task  <cit>  because relayed chemical exchange may contribute to the ephogsy signal intensities of all the hydrogens that are located within  <dig>  nm of surface exposed amino, guanidyl, carboxyl or hydroxyl groups. based on the sso7d reference structures used in the present study, all the observed ephogsy signals could be attributed to noes. therefore, a quantitative interpretation of the ephogsy data in terms of water-protein internuclear distances was not practicable. different rates of proton exchange between water and protein, if higher than dipolar cross-relaxation, could largely control the intensity of such noe peaks  <cit> . it follows that the presence of water molecules at the solvent-sso7d interface can only be qualitatively inferred by the distribution of ephogsy peaks along the protein backbone . correlations between the nmr derived hydration sites and the mdhs were quantitatively analyzed by examining the presence of mdhs within  <dig>  nm of the hydrogen atoms that showed ephogsy signals . good agreement between experimental and predicted data was found along the protein backbone. the only exception was for a few protons at the c-terminus of the protein and this finding can be explained by the large fluctuations observed for the end portion of the terminal helix in the md . as mentioned, the mdhs method  <cit>  cannot be used successfully when major protein backbone conformational changes are present. here it is worth noting that the ephogsy signals observed for ser <dig> and arg <dig> were consistent with the mdhs found in the center of the dna/protein interface. this finding indicated that the seeds for the formation of the diamond shaped group of water molecules present in the crystal structures of the sso7d-dna complexes  <cit>  also existed in the free form of the protein and in solution .

discussion
the hydration dynamics of sso7d has been investigated through  <dig> ns md simulations and ephogsy nmr studies. as reported in figure  <dig>  the mdhs were unevenly distributed on the protein surface, indicating that the sso7d hydration shell exhibited different local stabilities. a complex network of different contributions that include local flexibility and hydrophobicity in the protein structure determined the modes of molecular traffic of water and other molecules around the protein surface.

by comparing computational and experimental data on the dynamic aspects of sso7d hydration, several interesting features became apparent. correlations between the crystallographic water molecules and the mdhs were found only for water molecules that were in conserved positions. furthermore, even though the signals observed in the sso7d ephogsy spectra could not be unambiguously assigned to noewp or noe, the close correlation between the corresponding hydrogens and nearby mdhs was noticeable . from these findings it can be suggested that signals in ephogsy or equivalent spectra are, at least in a qualitative way, diagnostic of the hydration state of the protein. conversely, the absence of the spectral signals over extended regions of the protein surface strongly supports the presence of a protein hot spot.

the hydration landscape of sso7d consistently offered by x-ray diffractometry, nmr and md simulations indicates that, in the protein surface region where binding to dna and misfolded/unfolded proteins occurs  <cit> , a diamond-shaped cluster of four water molecules  <cit>  is anchored to the phe32-carbonyl located in the center of the binding surface via the water molecule  <dig> . the mdhs close to the ser <dig> and arg <dig> side chains clearly pointed to the positions of water molecules  <dig> and  <dig>  in agreement with the observed ephogsy signals from the β and σ hydrogen atoms of, respectively, the ser <dig> and arg <dig> side chains in the 4- <dig> β-strand pair . moreover, the phe <dig> region in the three stranded β-sheet was the only residue that showing relevant water residence times .

in the sso7d-gtgatcgc complex , the backbone amide group of lys <dig> and the n <dig> of g <dig> from the mismatched t-g base-pair are h-bond bridged via water  <dig>  a water molecule was found in a similar position for the complex with canonical base pairing  <cit> . an mdhs, consistently found near the 26- <dig> protein loop, stabilized the water molecule that interacted with the base-pair . in the middle of the protein/dna interaction surface, trp24-nε <dig> and ser31-oγ exhibited medium sized ephogsy effects that were confirmed by the presence of a nearby mdhs. comparative analysis of x-ray, nmr and md results clearly delineated a binding sub-site in this protein region that was partially protected by water molecules that were easily displaced; thus favoring a large variety of interactions. in the dna-bound structure, the mdhs was replaced by the n <dig> and n <dig> atoms of the g <dig> aromatic ring, indicating that hydrogen bonding could also be established by the amino acid side chains that support the sso7d chaperone activity.

it was very interesting to compare the present dynamic hydration profile with our previous investigation of sso7d surface accessibility using tempol and gd paramagnetic probes  <cit> . the anomalous small paramagnetic perturbations observed for the surface exposed sso7d p-loop region  <cit>  spanning residues 35- <dig>  can be now interpreted in terms of high solvent density  which would have prevented free local diffusion of the two probes . the md evidence is strengthened by the presence of four conserved water molecules in the region and by ephogsy signals from the backbone amide groups of gly <dig>  gly <dig>  lys <dig> and thr <dig>  furthermore, the lack of an ephogsy signal and the mdhs shield for the apical gly <dig> residue explains the observed strong paramagnetic attenuation in the presence of gd.

from a similar analysis, it was apparent how sso7d loop i, including tyr <dig>  lys <dig>  gly <dig> and glu <dig> residues, was free from mdhs and conserved water molecules . at the same time, loop i contained the nh group of lys <dig> which appeared among the most tempol and gd accessible backbone amides  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
combined analyses of md and nmr results, particularly when data from ephogsy spectra and perturbation profiles induced by soluble paramagnetic probes are available, can provide a detailed view of protein surface dynamics. surface accessibility and hydration of proteins appear strongly coupled, suggesting that the investigation procedure described here represents a new powerful strategy for protein hot spot mapping. it should be noted the dynamic character of the obtained data can offer an unique perspective for delineating transient sites where disruptors of protein-protein interactions can bind.
