BACKGROUND
fungal infections have increased dramatically over the last few decades and this rise in the number of opportunistic fungal infections has stimulated research towards the development of novel antifungal agents  <cit> . currently the fourth most common cause of nosocomial infection is the candida species  <cit> . notorious among all the candida species is the candida albicans  <cit> .

microbes are one of the most productive sources of natural products from which antibiotics are derived  <cit> . fungi, particularly the filamentous ones, are highly potential reservoirs of products with excellent antagonistic activity against human pathogens  <cit> . a variety of secondary metabolites including antimicrobial substances is reported to have been produced by the fermentation of penicillium species . their production depends upon the nutrition and cultivation conditions of the strains  <cit> . the nutritional requirements and physical parameters can be managed and controlled to increase the productivity of microbial metabolites  <cit> . however, these processes are usually quite long and arduous when accomplished using routine techniques such as a one-factor-at-a-time method  <cit> .

in any optimization process, first the screening of the important variables has to be done and subsequently estimation of optimal levels of these factors  <cit> . statistical methods are quite advantageous with reference to a rapid identification of the significant factors and also decrease in the total number of experiments . application of statistical methods like plackett–burman design  and response surface methodology  in process optimization have been reported  <cit> . the shortcomings of conventional methods have been eliminated by rsm . rsm is a fast and effective tool as it reduces the number of experimental trials and also helps to compare the significance of a number of variables at a time.

the objective of the present study was to identify the best conditions for the production of a candicidal compound by penicillium verruculosum mkh <dig>  by statistical approach. plackett–burman design  was used to screen the most significant parameters affecting metabolite production followed by a central composite design  of response surface methodology  to identify the optimum levels of the significant factors for maximizing the metabolite production.

RESULTS
the promising fungal strain was identified as penicillium verruculosum mkh <dig>  on the basis of its region sequencing and phylogenetic analysis . in order to find out the most suitable carbon and nitrogen sources, the one-factor-at-a-time  method was employed and on the basis of this, dextrose and peptone respectively were found to be the most favourable for the production of the bioactive metabolite. the composition of the production medium was selected on the basis of preliminary experiments .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree showing relationship penicillium verruculosum mkh <dig> and related taxa, based on analysis of its region. the numbers on the nodes indicate how often  the species to the right are grouped together in  <dig> bootstrap samples. fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici atcc  <dig> was used as an outgroup. bar,  <dig>  substitution per site




characterization of the antifungal metabolite
the uv spectral data exhibited strong absorption  at  <dig> and 210 nm indicating the presence of lactone ring. the ir spectral absorption at 1721 cm− <dig> and 1751 cm− <dig> revealed the presence of carbonyl group. other bands that appeared are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> , 1638 cm− <dig>  in the nmr spectrum the signals are δ <dig>  , δ <dig> , δ <dig> , δ <dig> , δ <dig> , δ <dig> , δ <dig>  and δ <dig> . the 13c nmr peaks at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  strongly favors the presence of carbonyl groups. other prominent peaks are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  indicating the presence of a lactone ring. the alkene carbons are also found to be present at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . the remaining methyl and methylene carbons are found to be present at  <dig>  ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  . the c, h, n analysis gave the estimation of carbon , hydrogen  and nitrogen was negligible . based on the above data, the structure was deduced as  <dig>  5- dihydroxy-3- -dihydro-furan-2-one .fig.  <dig> predicted structure of the antifungal metabolite




optimization by plackett-burman design
the significance of the seven factors viz. dextrose, peptone, nacl, initial ph, temperature, fermentation time, mgso <dig> h2o for metabolite production was examined by plackett-burman design. the levels of the factors in the design are given in table  <dig>  table  <dig> shows the experimental design with the seven factors under investigation as well as the effect of each factor on the response and significant levels. twelve runs were carried out to screen the effect of the variables  on metabolite production. a first-order model was fitted to the results obtained from the  <dig> experiments:table  <dig> levels of the factors tested in the plackett-burman design

response surface analysis
based on the plackett–burman design, response surface methodology  using ccd was employed to determine the optimal levels of the four most significant factors  for enhancing metabolite production. the four independent variables were studied at five different levels  and a set of  <dig> experiments with different combination of the selected variables were carried out. the lowest and the highest values of the variables were: initial ph,  <dig> and 8; temperature,  <dig> and 30 °c; peptone,  <dig>  and 10 g/l; mgso <dig> h2o,  <dig>  and  <dig>  g/l. the actual yield of the bioactive metabolite and the yield predicted by the model equation are given in table  <dig>  regression analysis was performed to fit the response function  with the experimental data. the second-order polynomial equation for metabolite production istable  <dig> central composite design in coded units

where a, b, c and d are the coded factors of initial ph and temperature, peptone and mgso <dig> h2o respectively.

from the results of f-test analysis of variance , it was found that the regression was statistically significant . the model f-value of  <dig>  implies the model is significant. values of “prob > f” less than  <dig>  indicate model terms are significant. in this case cd, a <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig>  d <dig> are significant model terms. the fit of the model was checked by the coefficient of determination r <dig> which was calculated to be  <dig> . the r2-value is always between  <dig> and  <dig>  and a value > <dig>  indicates aptness of the model. the “pred r-squared” of  <dig>  is in reasonable agreement with the “adj r-squared” of  <dig> . the “lack of fit f-value” of  <dig>  implies the lack of fit is not significant. as evident from the linear coefficient of  <dig> , the effect of peptone was the highest on the yield of the metabolite while low p values  indicated that the interaction between peptone and mgso <dig> h2o was significant  <cit> . statistical analysis helps to ascertain the factors generating signals that are large in comparison to noise  <cit> . adequate precision measures the signal to noise ratio and a ratio greater than  <dig> is desirable. in this case, the ratio of  <dig>  for antibiotic yield indicates an adequate signal. from the maximum point of the model, the optimal values of the four significant components were calculated to be a = − <dig> , b = − <dig> , c =  <dig>  and d = − <dig>   which corresponds to the values of  <dig> , 27 °c,  <dig>  g/l and  <dig>  g/l for initial ph, temperature, peptone, mgso <dig> h2o respectively. the model predicted a maximum response of  <dig>  mg/l metabolite yield at this point which was significantly higher than that obtained using the original medium. the observed versus the predicted response is shown in fig.  <dig>  the predicted data from the model are in agreement with the observed one as is evident from the figure. figure  <dig> shows the normal plot of residuals, the linear pattern indicating normality in the error term  <cit> . a plot of residuals versus the predicted response is shown in fig.  <dig>  as the residuals are scattered randomly so the variance of the original observation is constant for all the values of y  <cit> . the interaction between two variables by keeping the other two at zero level are depicted in the 3d response surface curves .table  <dig> regression results of the ccd

discussion
genus penicillium is a potential producer of a vast array of secondary metabolites like tremorgenic toxins, pigments, potentiators of nerve growth factor, inducers of osteoblast differentiation and most importantly antibiotics including macrocyclic polylactones . in this report, characterization of the candicidal compound revealed the presence of lactone ring and carbonyl groups as prominent components. breinholt et al.  <cit>  had also reported the isolation of antifungal macrocyclic polylactones from p. verruculosum. production of secondary metabolites is influenced by a number of cultivation parameters ranging from precursors to trace elements  <cit> . the combined effects of all the involved factors cannot be determined through traditional practices like the classical one-factor-at-a-time approach  <cit> . interactions among factors and multifactor optimization cannot be evaluated using this method. these limitations can be overcome by statistical tools like rsm that enable the study of the effects of several factors simultaneously and determine the optimum values of the variables so as to maximize the response  <cit> . pbd was applied to determine the main factors affecting metabolite production. in this investigation, from the pbd analysis it was found that among the variables tested, four factors viz. initial ph, temperature, peptone and mgso <dig> h2o, were found to have significant effect on the production of bioactive metabolite by the strain p.verruculosum mkh <dig>  medium ph, temperature  <cit>  and peptone  <cit>  have been reported to be some of the most important experimental parameters influencing bioactive secondary metabolite production by penicillium species. dextrose and peptone were found to be important also in the production of sclerotiorin from p. sclerotiorum  <cit> . however brian et al.  <cit>  reported that glucose was the best carbon source for wortmannin synthesis from p. wortmanni while glycerol was most favourable for mevastatin production by p. citrinum  <cit> . the reason for this dissimilarity might be the use of different strains and different culturing conditions, yet another reason might be the selection of different carbon sources in the original medium  <cit> . moreover, the sources for growth and secondary metabolism may be different. for example, glucose may be beneficial for growth but the same may not be true for secondary metabolite formation  <cit> . peptone played a crucial role in the biosynthesis of the metabolite sclerotiorin by p. sclerotiorum  <cit> . several factors influence the effect of nitrogen sources on synthesis of secondary metabolite. the sources that are important for growth may negatively affect secondary metabolic pathways; there are reports on the negative effects of ammonium salts  <cit> .

under the rsm optimized conditions of initial ph <dig> , temperature 27 °c, peptone  <dig>  g/l and mgso <dig> h2o  <dig>  g/l, a maximum metabolite production of  <dig>  mg/l was predicted, simultaneously proved by triplicate experiments conducted under the same conditions. mgso <dig> h2o was found to be essential also for the synthesis of mevastatin from p. citrinum  <cit> . trace elements like zn, mn, fe, cu are important for microbial growth because of their presence in metalloenzymes or as enzyme activators  <cit>  while mg and ca are macronutrients in fungal nutrition  <cit> . contrary to this, in our case the effect of mg on metabolite yield was significant. similar inference was also made on the production of sclerotiorin by p. sclerotiorum  <cit> . temperature and ph affect the regulation of molecules like atp which in turn influence the regulation of metabolic pathways, coupled reactions and functional yields at the membrane and cell wall level  <cit> . a change in the concentration of hydrogen ions may change the redox fluxes and oxidative state of energy molecules like atp, thereby causing diverse metabolism and generating different products  <cit> . brian,  <dig>  <cit>  reported that high initial ph  of media was best for development of fungistatic activity by penicillium terlikowskii. similar observation was also made for the production of antimicrobial agent by p. viridicatum  <cit> . metabolic activity of fungus may be terminated by low temperature while high temperature kills the fungal cell  <cit> . the optimal temperature range for the production of the antibiotic and nephrotoxin, citrinin, by p. viridicatum was 25–30 °c  <cit> . previous studies have shown that a temperature of 25 °c was found to be optimal in a number of cases  <cit> .

the use of polyene antibiotics in clinical practice is restricted due to problems in their stability which is affected by extreme values of ph and temperature leading to total loss of drug potency. the stability of lactone antibiotics depends on the tetraene chromophore of the molecule and heating beyond 100 °c leads to cleavage of these four conjugated double bonds resulting in the degradation of the antibiotic  <cit> . according to stark,  <dig>  <cit> , neutral aqueous suspensions of natamycin can remain stable at 50 °c for several days and a slight decrease in biological activity was observed after heating for 20 min at 110 °c. the polyene antifungal agent nystatin is more active at low temperature  while amphotericinb is at 41 °c and their activity against c. albicans is stable at ph between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . similar observation was made by raab,  <dig>  <cit> , on the stability of natamycin at different ph. likewise, phoslactomycin b is most stable at a ph of  <dig>   <cit> . high ph results in saponification of the lactone and additional decomposition due to a series of retroaldol reactions while low ph might bring about the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond  <cit> .

so far as our knowledge goes, till date there are no reports available on the production of antibiotics by penicillium verruculosum through media optimization using rsm. the enhanced yield of the antibiotic strongly suggests that the fungus p. verruculosum mkh <dig> can be efficiently used for antibiotic production on a large scale. optimization not only led to a  <dig> fold increase in metabolite yield but the same was achieved at much lesser time . in conclusion, statistical methods can be effectively utilized for arriving at optimal solutions and in analysing the interactive effects of the parameters thereby leading to improved metabolite production.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report on the production of antifungal compound by penicillium verruculosum through media optimization using rsm. from the plackett–burman design analysis it was found that among the variables tested, four factors viz. initial ph, temperature, peptone and mgso <dig> h2o, were found to have significant effect on the production of bioactive metabolite by the strain p.verruculosum mkh <dig>  the rsm optimized conditions of initial ph <dig> , temperature 27 °c, peptone  <dig>  g/l and mgso <dig> h2o  <dig>  g/l predicted a maximum metabolite production of  <dig>  mg/l which was proved by triplicate experiments conducted under the same conditions. a  <dig> fold increase in metabolite yield was obtained at a much lesser time. in conclusion, statistical methods can be effectively utilized for arriving at optimal solutions and in analysing the interactive effects of the parameters thereby leading to improved metabolite production.
