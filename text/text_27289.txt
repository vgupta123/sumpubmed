BACKGROUND
mesenchymal stromal cells , often termed mesenchymal stem cells, may be isolated from bone marrow, adipose and other tissues. they adhere strongly to tissue culture plastic and are capable of multipotent differentiation that can be demonstrated in vitro. mscs can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondroblasts, adipocytes and myoblasts . since the survival and migration of human mscs  grafted into rat brains was demonstrated  <cit> , the possibility that such cells might act as suitable tools for promoting central nervous system  repair has been raised. this notion was further strengthened by the report that murine mscs may differentiate into mature astrocytes after implantation into neonatal mouse brains  <cit> . donor mscs have also been reported to give rise to neuronal phenotypes in adult mice brains after transplantation  <cit> . during the last six years, there have been many reports describing in vitro neural transdifferentiation of mscs derived from a range of different species . all protocols that have been used for such investigations can be divided into three broad categories: i.e. those using  chemical compounds  <cit> ,  growth factors  <cit> , or  neurosphere-like cultivation  <cit> . furthermore, combinations of these different protocols have also been reported to induce neural differentiation  <cit> . such reports of in vitro neural transdifferentiation by mscs derived from experimental animal- or human sources have been based on the detection of neural-related mrna as well as proteins by the treated cells. in the present investigation, rt-pcr and immunocytochemistry were used to demonstrate the basal expression of several of the commonly used marker genes or proteins by undifferentiated human mscs. the data obtained by this study revealed a substantial degree of heterogeneity of the basal expression of neural-related genes that had not previously been described.

RESULTS
characterization of human mscs
isolated hmscs were characterized by three criteria:  adherence to tissue culture plastic,  specific surface antigen expression, and  multipotent differentiation as defined by the mesenchymal and tissue stem cell committee of the international society for cellular therapy  <cit> .

fluorescent activated cell sorting  analysis demonstrated that the expanded, plastic adherent cells used in the present investigation were positive for the surface markers cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig>  but negative for cd11b, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and hla-dr . to demonstrate their multipotent potential, mscs were differentiated to adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteocytes according to published protocols  <cit> . lipid vacuoles in differentiated adipocytes were visualized with oil red o . however, not all cells demonstrated the same degree of staining. induction of chondrogenic differentiation was performed in cell pellets which developed a proteoglycan-rich extracellular matrix. thin sections of these pellets were stained with toluidine blue , demonstrating a metachromatic staining that was characteristic of cartilage matrix  <cit> . osteogenic differentiation resulted in an immense production of mineral deposits that were stained with alizarin-red-s . thus, the cells used in this study fulfilled all criteria to be defined as mscs.

neural marker expression by undifferentiated human mscs
the neural specific rna transcripts, obtained from hmscs of four different donors, were categorized into four sub-groups:  neuronal markers,  glial markers,  neural related transcription factors and  others . for every marker, both adult and fetal human brain extracts were used as positive controls.

pcr transcript expression was defined as strong , moderate , weak  or not detectable .

neuronal markers
one of the neuronal markers investigated was dopamine receptor d <dig> , a marker for dopaminergic neurons  <cit> , which was moderately expressed by three donors . transcripts for enolase <dig> , normally found in mature neurons and in cells of neuronal origin  <cit> , were also found in human mscs . microtubule-associated protein 1b , that is suggested to play an important cytoskeletal role in development and function of the nervous system  <cit> , was strongly detected in donors  <dig> to  <dig> as well as moderately in donor  <dig>  other widely used markers for neurons are the neurofilaments . the expression of nfh , nfm  and nfl  in human mscs was analyzed in the present study. low levels of transcripts for nfl could only be detected in donors  <dig> and  <dig>  but moderate levels were found in donor  <dig>  the syntaxin  functions in the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the synaptic membrane of neurons  <cit> . however, a moderate amount of stx1a was also detected in the undifferentiated mscs of donor  <dig> and  <dig>  another synaptic vesicle-related protein, synaptophysin   <cit> , was only slightly detectable in donors  <dig> to  <dig>  the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase , a neurotransmitter-related enzyme in catecholaminergic neurons, was also only weakly detectable in donor  <dig>  no expression of mrna for the axonal microtubule-associated protein tau  could be observed ,

glial markers
analyzed in this study were glial fibrillary acidic protein   <cit> , myelin basic protein   <cit>  and the calcium binding protein, s100β  <cit> . none of the hmscs were found to express s100β or gfap, an intermediate filament protein that is normally expressed by astrocytes and schwann cells. however,  <dig> of the hmsc population  were found to express low levels of mrna for mbp, a major myelin associated protein.

neural-related transcription factors
transcripts for achaete-scute complex homolog  <dig> , a transcription factor that plays a role in neuronal commitment and differentiation and in the generation of olfactory and autonomic neurons  <cit> , could not be detected in any of the donor cells. furthermore, none of the donor cells expressed mrna for neurogenic differentiation  <dig> , a factor suggested to be involved in the development and maintenance of the mammalian nervous system  <cit> . however, the expression of the homeobox protein engrailed- <dig>  and nurr <dig> , were detected at moderate  and strong levels .

others
the transcripts investigated in this category were bag <dig>  nestin and also gapdh . bag <dig>  which has anti-apoptotic functions in a variety of cell types and plays an essential role in the survival of differentiated neurons  <cit> , was highly expressed in all donor samples. the intermediate filament protein nestin, was initially identified as a marker for neural stem cells  <cit> , but has since been found to have a much broader expression in a range of cell types and tissues  <cit> . transcripts for nestin were also detected in all human donor mscs samples, however, there were clear differences in the intensity of the signal; mscs derived from donor  <dig> being much stronger than that from donors  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

the commercially available samples of total rna that had been generated from adult and fetal human brain samples showed developmentally related changes in the intensity of expression for certain mrnas, e.g. stronger bands for the neuronal markers enolase <dig>  nfh, syp, the glial markers mbp and s100β, and the transcription factor engrailed- <dig> were fall elevated in control adult samples. however, weaker bands for map1b, nestin and the transcription factors ascl <dig> and neurod <dig> were found in adult control samples. no major differences in the intensity of bands between control adult and fetal brain samples could be found for the other transcripts . the differences in mrna transcripts resemble the expected shifts in the intensity of expression during the development of the nervous system. the transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix family ascl <dig> and neurod <dig> are expressed in neuronal progenitors  <cit>  and the cytoskeletal constituents nestin and map1b were expressed at higher levels in the control fetal samples. on the contrary, enolase <dig>  <cit> , nfh  <cit> , syp  <cit> , mbp  <cit>  and s100β  <cit>  are expressed by more mature cells, reflecting their higher level of expression in the control adult samples. although the transcription factor engrailed- <dig> plays a role in the formation of interneurons as well as in the regionalization of the developing brain  <cit> , it is possible that the developmental stage from which the control fetal sample was obtained had already passed the time point for expression. alternatively, expression of the transcript is only found in a fraction of cells and is diminished in total brain mrna extraction. the faint engrailed- <dig> band detected in the adult samples may have reflected its anti-apoptotic role in mature neurons  <cit> .

immunocytochemical detection of neural marker proteins by undifferentiated human mscs
in addition to rt-pcr, a number of non-differentiated donor hmsc samples were chosen for immunocytochemical analysis. staining of enolase <dig> revealed a cytoplasmic distribution . a cytoskeletal staining was observed with antibodies against map1b  and nestin . however, staining for nurr <dig> was detected at different intensities and revealed a cytoplasmic distribution . quantification of immunocytochemical staining from three donors  revealed that enolase <dig> expression was found in  <dig> ±  <dig> % of all cells, map1b expression was found in  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of all cells, and nurr <dig> expression was found in  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the cells expressed. nestin expression was found to be present in all cells of the three donors analyzed. thus, this data demonstrates that both protein and mrnas of a range of neurally-related markers is already expressed by non-differentiated hmsc.

discussion
the potential of adult mscs to transdifferentiate into neural cell types has aroused great interest in research. such a capacity opens extensive possibilities for autologous therapeutic treatments in a variety of neurological disorders. however, clear and unequivocal data regarding differentiation needs to be generated to provide a solid foundation for further studies. in the present investigation, undifferentiated hmscs were found to express a number of neural-related genes . significantly, it became clear that there was considerable donor-related heterogeneity in the expression pattern of the hmsc populations, even though the criteria for isolation and identification  were followed. it is possible that such donor heterogeneity might be responsible for the variable degree of success reported by a number of research groups in their ability to transdifferentiate hmscs to a neural phenotype.

one of the first descriptions of neural differentiation by hmscs reported the detection of nestin and gfap after differentiation, but importantly failed to report the pre-differentiated phenotype of the cells  <cit> . this same oversight has also occurred in a most recent publication demonstrating the generation of neural cell types from human bone marrow-derived mscs  <cit> . neurospheres derived from human mscs were shown immunocytochemically to express nestin and musashi- <dig>  however, the basal expression profile of the mscs was not reported. rapid morphological changes of rat mscs have also been reported to be associated with the detection of enolase <dig> and nfm . however, the non-treated, control cells were not analyzed and the rapid morphological changes aroused great scepticism because they did not reflect normal developmental processes  <cit> . such changes were later demonstrated to be due to the breakdown of the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> .

previous attempts to identify the basal expression pattern of undifferentiated human mscs using serial analysis of gene expression  has revealed the presence of mrna not only characteristic for mesenchymal cells but also endothelial, epithelial and neuronal lineages  <cit> . neural related mrnas found to be amongst the  <dig> most abundant gene products expressed included high molecular weight neurofilament , the high affinity nerve growth factor receptor  and glial derived nexin  <dig> alpha. however, in stark contrast, nfh was undetectable in all donor hmsc samples of the present investigation. this observation likely reflects the high degree of donor sample heterogeneity mentioned earlier.

heterogeneity of gene expression by rat and human mscs has also reported following rt-pcr of cell populations and clonal cell lines, revealing mesodermal, germinal, endodermal and ectodermal expression patterns  <cit> . neurally related transcripts expressed by rat msc included nmda receptor sub-units, syntaxin, amyloid precursor protein, and both rat and human mscs were reported to express gfap and neurod mrna  <cit> . both of these transcript were absent in all of the samples used in the present investigation. however, syntaxin 1a was weakly expressed in  <dig> of the human samples but was negative in the remaining  <dig> donor samples, once again highlighting the substantial inter-donor variability.

in the present investigation, the expression of nestin mrna could be found in all donor samples of undifferentiated hmscs. nestin was originally identified as an intermediate filament protein expressed by neural stem cells  <cit> . recent reports using rat mscs have described undifferentiated mscs as being nestin-negative, but that expression increased progressively with increasingly higher passage numbers  <cit> . the acquisition of nestin expression by the higher passage number mscs has been suggested to be an important stage in the ability of the cells to form spheres and subsequently undergo neural differentiation  <cit> . it is possible that such progressive increase of nestin expression may reflect the culture conditions selecting for – and enhancing the proliferation of a sub-population of nestin-positive cells. the presence of such sub-populations of stem cells or progenitors within mscs may contribute to the high degree of heterogeneity reported by others  <cit> . indeed both intrinsic plasticity of mscs and contamination by stem cells from other sources  have been suggested to be contributory mechanism to the apparent switch to a neural phenotype by mscs  <cit> . although recent publications have demonstrated the expression of a number of neural-related genes in non-differentiated population or clones of mscs, the degree of donor variability has, until now, remained unclear.

transplantation of undifferentiated mscs into experimental models of cns injury has clearly demonstrated improved motor and sensory function  <cit> , and in a phase i clinical study, transplantation was proven to be safe  <cit> . following engraftment, donor mscs were reported to be associated with a range of neuronal and glial markers suggesting the spontaneous differentiation of the grafted cells in vivo  <cit> . since it was shown, that the spontaneous differentiation of grafted cells occurs only in few cells  <cit> , other reasons for inducing a beneficial outcome should be considered. an on-going discussion revolves around the possible improvement in function being an outcome of cell fusion events between donor mscs with host cells  <cit> . however, cell fusion also occurs at only a very low frequency  <cit>  and it has been described that neural differentiation can occur without this phenomenon  <cit> . an alternative, and possibly more likely, mechanism for improved function after implantation of mscs may be due to the local release of growth factors  <cit> . it has been shown that undifferentiated mscs express a range of growth factors including neurotrophin- <dig> , brain-derived neurotrophic factor , glial-derived neurotrophic factor , nerve growth factor , vascular endothelial growth factor , hepatocyte growth factor   <cit> , ciliary neurotrophic factor  and basic fibroblast growth factors   <cit> . these factors could certainly play a role in several processes, including neurogenesis, neuroprotection, vascularisation and scar inhibition as it was already demonstrated for vegf  <cit> . such a donor heterogeneity was also reported by others for growth factor secretion by hmscs. transplantation of cells was found to promote a variable, donor-dependent degree of axon growth and functional recovery  <cit> . furthermore, it is possible that donor mscs may also influence axonal or tissue regeneration in- and around the host lesion site by providing an array of growth-supporting extracellular matrix molecules, including fibronectin, collagens, laminin, hyaluronan and proteoglycans. these molecules are involved in migration, cell survival, cell proliferation and cell differentiation  and a change in their local concentrations may influence endogenous neural stem cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the ability of mscs, in particular human mscs, to generate neural-related cell types for future transplantation-based intervention strategies has become a topic of considerable controversy. a number of possible mechanisms have been suggested to explain such cellular behaviour, including true transdifferentiation, the presence of multiply-primed stem cells capable of differentiating into a number of lineages, contamination by neural crest-derived stem cells and tissue culture artefacts. the present investigation supports the contention that mscs selected on the basis of plastic adherence, multipotency and facs analysis are highly heterogeneous populations of cells. all donor samples investigated in the present demonstrated expression patterns that were different from each other. such inter-donor variability regarding the expression of neural-related genes has not been previously described, but supports the heterogeneity of hmscs reported by others. it is possible that such inter-individual variability may affect the ability of donated cells to respond to particular tissue culture conditions. it should therefore be considered that not all donated mscs may be appropriate for future autograft cell transplantation strategies.
