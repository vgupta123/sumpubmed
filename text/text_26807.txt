BACKGROUND
streptococcus suis serotype  <dig>  is an important zoonotic pathogen that causes severe porcine infectious diseases, including arthritis, meningitis, and pneumonia  <cit> . virulent strains of ss <dig> can also be transmitted to humans  by direct contact, causing meningitis, permanent hearing loss, septic shock, and even death. two large-scale outbreaks of severe ss <dig> epidemics occurred in china in  <dig> and  <dig>  causing great economic losses in the swine industry. these two outbreaks also posed serious public health risks from the newly emerging streptococcal toxin shock syndrome , which claimed  <dig> lives  <cit> . over the past decade, considerable attention has been given to the study of virulence factors  and the pathogen-host interaction in this emerging pathogen. however, comparative studies at the whole-genome level had little done to decipher the evolutionary aspects by which the virulence and environmental adaptation of ss <dig> are shaped.

to shed light on the evolution of pathogenicity and potential genomic polymorphisms of ss <dig>  several virulent strains were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and comparative genomic studies. comparative analysis of the whole-genomic dna sequence of the european s. suis strain p1/ <dig>  and two representative highly virulent strains  isolated from stss patients during the two epidemic outbreaks in china uncovered a candidate pathogenicity island  named 89k, which has been confirmed to undergo horizontal gene transfer  by our recent work  <cit> . further analysis based on pcr amplification revealed that 89k exclusively present in the epidemic strains in these two chinese ss <dig> outbreaks but not in other domestic clinical isolates or international virulent strains  <cit> . however, analysis of the unfinished genomic sequence of ss <dig> strain 89/ <dig>  revealed that a partial 89k sequence  is present in this typical north american virulent strain. similarly, results from a recently published work suggest that s. suis strain bm <dig>  which was isolated from a human meningitis case in vietnam in  <dig>  contains two regions with extended similarity to 89k  <cit> . these findings led us to hypothesize that the genome of ss <dig> would be highly polymorphic among different strains.

in this study, we employed the comparative genome re-sequencing  approach developed by roche nimblegen systems to investigate genomic diversity in a collection of  <dig> ss <dig> strains, including isolates from the two outbreaks in china, other virulent strains from china , virulent strains from european countries, and several avirulent strains. although cgs cannot identify recently gained genes due to technical limitations, the dna microarray-based comparative genome sequencing technique allows high resolution detection of sequence polymorphisms based on a reference genome  <cit> . using this technology, we identified a number of novel genetic polymorphisms in ss <dig> strains and several candidate virulence factors that may contribute to stss. our results provide new insight into the virulence mechanisms and genome dynamics of ss <dig>  which will help to elucidate the evolution of ss <dig> strains and better monitor the incidence and spread of epidemic strains.

RESULTS
we used nimblegen tiling arrays to analyze the genomic variability of  <dig> ss <dig> isolates , including five strains  isolated from stss patients during the two chinese ss <dig> outbreaks, two strains  isolated from dead pigs during the  <dig> outbreak in china, eight virulent strains isolated from china before the  <dig> outbreak  or from other countries , and three avirulent strains . the complete genome sequence of 05zyh <dig> , a highly virulent strain isolated from a chinese stss patient during the sichuan outbreak in  <dig>  <cit> , is available and was used as the common reference strain for each cgs analysis.

phylogenetic profiling of the ss <dig> strains
a total of  <dig>  29-mer probes were synthesized according to the genome sequence of 05zyh <dig> to map the genomic variations of different ss <dig> strains. the nimblegen algorithms assign each probe a '1'or '0' status based on the probe signal intensity ratio  to reflect the sequence similarity of the corresponding region. a phylogenetic tree was then drawn based on the probe status of the entire probe set from the various ss <dig> strains . consequently, the ss <dig> strains analyzed could be clustered into three major groups, the eight virulent strains isolated from the two stss outbreaks in china were grouped together, and their genomes were highly similar to one another. the virulent strains isolated from european, japan, and china before the two chinese stss outbreaks were grouped together, except the netherlands  <dig> strain. considerable genome variation, however, exists among members of this group. strain  <dig> formed a single clade separated from the other virulent and avirulent strains. the three avirulent strains were clustered into the third group, and the two isolates from china  were more closely related to each other than to the avirulent strain t <dig> isolated from the netherlands. the results of phylogenetic profiling revealed that the virulent strains isolated from the two stss outbreaks in china are highly homologous, and genomic polymorphisms were significant in ss <dig> populations. in general, the classification of these  <dig> ss <dig> strains based on genome similarity and variation, as revealed by nimblegen analysis, is in good agreement with the epidemiological history and differential virulence of these strains.

polymorphisms in the 89k pai
in previous studies, the so-called 89k genomic island of strain 05zyh <dig> was considered a candidate pai of virulent ss <dig> strains responsible for the two stss outbreaks in china and was unique to stss-causing virulent isolates collected since  <dig>  <cit> . the 89k island is ~89-kb in length and composed of  <dig> predicted genes  in the genome of 05zyh <dig> . consistently, our cgs and pcr analysis revealed that all eight virulent strains isolated from the two chinese outbreaks contain the entire 89k fragment, whereas the international virulent strains ss2-n, s <dig>  s <dig>  and  <dig>  as well as one strain  isolated in china before the  <dig> outbreak, completely lacks this element . however, the 89k pai displays a considerable number of polymorphisms in the other ss <dig> strains . two chinese strains isolated before the outbreaks,  <dig> and  <dig>  contain a portion  of the 89k fragment . a set of primers based on the sequence of region ii was designed , and the pcrs with primer pairs p2/p <dig>  p3/p <dig>  p5/p <dig>  p7/p <dig>  and p7/p <dig> all generated products of the expected sizes, indicating that the virulent strains  <dig> and  <dig> contain region ii . however, a ~ <dig> -kb amplicon was also obtained with primer pair p1/p <dig>  suggesting that region ii in strains  <dig> and  <dig> is found at different locations with respective to the 89k locus in the genome of 05zyh <dig> .

virulent strain  <dig> and avirulent strain t <dig>  isolated in the netherlands, appeared to have a similar polymorphism pattern in the 89k island. both contain region iv  and region vi  of the 89k element. this was evident from the nimblegen cgs analysis  and confirmed by further pcr analysis . pcr amplifications using primer pairs p10/p <dig>  p11/p <dig>  and p13/p <dig> for strain  <dig>  p10/p <dig>  p11/p <dig>  and p13/p <dig> for strain t <dig>  and p15/p <dig> and p15/p <dig> for both strains yielded specific products of the expected sizes. the main difference between these two strains is the sequence that connects region iv with vi. a ~ <dig> -kb fragment in strain  <dig>  and a  <dig> -kb band in t <dig>  was obtained by pcr using primers p13/p <dig>  respectively. as in the case of strains  <dig> and  <dig>  region iv and vi in strains  <dig> and t <dig> also reside at different locations than the 89k island in 05zyh <dig> because a  <dig> -kb pcr product was detected by primer pair p1/p <dig> in both strains .

avirulent strains 05has <dig> and zf contain the first three genes  of the 3'-end of the 89k pai . further, strains 05has <dig>  zf, and  <dig> appear to possess gene homologs to the tn5252-like transposon region , though the sequences are less similar to that of the reference strain , which has been confirmed by shotgun sequencing of 05has <dig> . together, our data suggest that the entire 89k island only exists in ss <dig> strains involved in the two outbreaks in china, and portions of the 89k element can be present in other ss <dig> strains. additionally, the 89k sequence is highly polymorphic among different ss <dig> strains, and after thorough analysis, our results indicate that region iii , region v , and the majority of region i  are exclusively present in stss-causing ss <dig> strains.

deletions and significantly variant genes
in addition to the variations of the 89k pai, the entire ss <dig> genome exhibits considerable diversity among different strains . compared to the reference 05zyh <dig> genome, the chinese stss-causing strains contain no obvious deletions or significant gene variances, which is consistent with their epidemiology and clinical presentation. for two strains  isolated in china, but before the two stss outbreaks, and another two strains  isolated in the netherlands, there are no detectable deletions or significantly variant genes, except for the 89k polymorphisms described above. however, four major deletions were identified in the other virulent and avirulent strains . as shown in table  <dig>  the virulent strain ss2-n lacks all four regions of differences , while strains  <dig> and s <dig> lack rd <dig>  rd <dig>  and rd <dig>  rd <dig> is also absent in virulent strain  <dig>  avirulent strain t <dig> is devoid of rd <dig> and rd <dig>  and strains 05has <dig> and zf lack rd <dig> and rd <dig>  the four deletions were all characterized as having direct repeats and deviating gc content at their terminal sequences. furthermore, rd <dig> and rd <dig> contain mobile genetic elements, such as recombinase and integrase, suggesting that they were acquired horizontally by strains with these regions present in their genome. nevertheless, none of these regions carries known or putative virulence factors.

* the average gc content of the 05zyh <dig> chromosome is  <dig> %.

compared to the virulent strains, the three avirulent strains 05has <dig>  zf, and t <dig> contain additional deletions. a total of  <dig> genes are absent or display significant sequence variation compared to the reference strain . among these  <dig> genes,  <dig> encode hypothetical proteins, and the remaining  <dig> encode proteins that are mainly involved in abc-type transporters, phosphotransferase systems, transcription regulators, carbohydrate metabolism, co-factor biosynthesis, restriction-modification systems, and cellular surface structure. strains 05has <dig> and zf exhibit a similar deletion profile, except for three genes  that are present only in zf. strains 05has <dig> and t <dig> exhibit  <dig> and  <dig> gene deletions or significantly variant genes, respectively, including  <dig> genes shared by all three avirulent strains . the virulence-related epf gene cluster  <cit> , which encodes extracellular protein factor  was absent in the avirulent strains  <cit> . consistent with previous research, this gene cluster is present in all of the analyzed virulent strains. the orphan response regulator revs proved to be important for ss <dig> pathogenesis was also absent in all three avirulent strains  <cit> . the roles of other genes specifically absent in these avirulent strains in virulence remain unknown. some of them may be candidate virulence-related genes, and future research will focus on the possible role of these genes in the molecular pathogenesis of ss <dig> 

single nucleotide polymorphisms  in ss <dig> strains
aside from the detected deletions and significantly variant genes,  <dig> to  <dig> snps were identified in each of the virulent ss <dig> strains, but no snps were found in the avirulent strains compared to the 05zyh <dig> reference strain . roche nimblegen tiling cgs arrays are sensitive to snp detection only when the genomic divergence between the tested and the reference strains is <  <dig> %. thus, the lack of detected snps in the avirulent strains can be ascribed to the large genomic variations between these avirulent strains, which have been confirmed by shotgun-sequencing of strain 05has <dig> . on the whole, the identified snps in the stss-causing virulent strains are significantly less abundant than those in the other virulent isolates. this result is consistent with the phylogenetic profiling described above, as well as the epidemiology and clinical presentation of these strains. analysis of these snps is ongoing and is beginning to provide some explanation for the observed deletions and significantly variant genes.

discussion
in this study, roche nimblegen tiling arrays were used to detect the genomic diversity among epidemiologically distinct ss <dig> strains. one significant finding is the identification of specific genes that are only present in the stss-causing strains involved in the two ss <dig> outbreaks in china. previous work suggests that the 89k pai is unique to ss <dig> strains involved in the stss cases  <cit> . however, whole genome cgs analysis of  <dig> ss <dig> strains allowed us to carefully examine this island and identify specific regions that are present in the stss-causing strains but not in any other ss <dig> strains.

we found that portions of the 89k fragment, particularly regions ii, iv, and vi, also exist in some other virulent and avirulent strains, albeit at different locations. therefore, this finding cautions against the sole use of pcr amplification to evaluate the absence of the 89k pai. importantly, we found that regions iii, v, and part of i are exclusively present in the stss-causing strains. recently published work suggests that ss <dig> strain bm <dig>  which was isolated from a human meningitis case in vietnam, contains two regions with extended similarity to 89k but lacks most region v genes  <cit> . these results indicate that genes within region v likely contribute to the high invasiveness of the stss-causing strains.

dna sequencing analysis revealed that region v encodes several abc-type transporters  and regulatory proteins, such as the salk/r two-component system , which is essential for full virulence of ss <dig> strains involved in the outbreaks in china   <cit> . one of the key questions arising from the two chinese ss <dig> outbreaks is what bacterial factors contribute to the stss that occurred in many patients. phenotypic analysis ruled out the implication of super-antigens in the pathogenesis of stss  <cit> , and genome analysis has thus far failed to uncover any homologues of m protein, suggesting that alternative virulence mechanisms might account for the development of stss. the abc transport system  encoded by region v belongs to a large family of abc transporters that export cell waste products or toxins, surface components, proteins, and other molecules involved in bacterial pathogenesis   <cit> . therefore, participation of this abc transport system in the pathogenesis of stss cannot be excluded and requires further investigation.

comparative analysis of the  <dig> ss <dig> strains also identified a number of genes, including several well-characterized virulence genes, that are absent in the three avirulent isolates, which may account for the loss of virulence and provide new insight into the virulence mechanisms of ss <dig>  among these absent gene products, plcr is a major virulence regulator that was first described in the gram-positive bacillus group   <cit> , which activates the expression of toxins, hemolysins, phospholipases, proteases, bacteriocins, transporters, cell wall biogenesis, two-component sensors, and chemotaxis  <cit> . until now, there were no reports about the role of plcr in the streptococcus genus. however, homologues of plcr are ubiquitous in s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus, and s. equi, indicating that this regulator may be functional in these organisms and a candidate virulence regulator in ss <dig> 

in addition, lipase is important for bacteria to grow in carbohydrate-restricted conditions, where lipids are the sole carbon source, and help bacteria to stick to each other or to specific host tissues  <cit> . it has been well documented that lipase plays a key role in the colonization, dissemination, and adhesion of staphylococcus aureus  <cit> , staphylococcus epidermidis  <cit> , and pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . based on these observations, it was reasonable to assume that lipase  is also related to the virulence of ss <dig> strains.

sortases are responsible for the cleavage of many surface proteins characterized by a c-terminal lpxtg motif and the linkage of the processed proteins to the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria. in the s. suis 05zyh <dig> genome, sortase genes are distributed into four clusters: srta, srtbcd, srte, and srtf, respectively  <cit> . srta is involved in the localization of muramidase-released protein  and surface antigen one   <cit> . disruption of srta impairs the colonizing potential in specific organs and attenuates the full virulence of s. suis  <cit> . very recently, the srtf cluster was proven to be essential for pilus biosynthesis in ss <dig>  <cit> . the srtbcd cluster  encodes nine proteins, including three sortases, three pilus subunits, and three ancillary proteins  <cit> . the srtbcd homologues in s. pneumoniae mediate the assembly and surface topology of adhesive pili, and deletion of the srtbcd cluster completely prevents pneumococcal pilus biogenesis  <cit> . pili have recently been recognized in gram-positive pathogens as important virulence factors involved in adhesion and invasion  <cit> , and they increase pathogenicity in animal models  <cit> . furthermore, genetic evidence also demonstrates that the pili of gram-positive bacteria are antigenic and protective of immunized animals  <cit> . given these facts, the absence of srtbcd cluster from the avirulent strains tested in our study strongly indicated that the pilus is important for ss <dig> pathogenesis and could be exploited as an immune target for ss <dig> infections.

for survival, bacteria have developed a variety of highly sophisticated and sensitive signal transduction pathways with which they adapt their gene expression patterns to meet the challenges of their ever-changing surroundings  <cit> . these mechanisms enable bacterial cells to communicate with their hosts, external environment, and between one another, allowing them to establish specific responses or develop specialized structures  to ensure their survival, colonization, and dissemination. in this study, six putative transcriptional regulators and a response regulator  in signal transduction pathways were absent from the avirulent strains. revs is an orphan response regulator and plays a role in the pathogenesis of ss <dig> infections  <cit> . the ctsr  regulator negatively regulates the expression of class iii heat shock genes, which are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature  <cit> . although the other transcriptional regulators remain to be studied, it is reasonable to hypothesize that they may also be implicated in the pathogenesis of ss <dig> 

intriguingly, nearly all of the genes  missing in the three avirulent strains are also absent in ss <dig> strain 89/ <dig>  based on the draft genome sequence of 89/ <dig> . strain 89/ <dig> was isolated from a diseased pig and shown to be virulent in an experimental infection model  <cit> . it represents a typical north american virulent strain that lacks three virulence protein markers . here, we found that 89/ <dig> also lacks the candidate virulence genes that are described above, which are typically found in the european and chinese virulent strains. why is strain 89/ <dig> still virulent despite the lack of the virulence genes described above? this dilemma may be explained by the divergent evolution of 89/ <dig>  the genome of 89/ <dig> is significantly different from the sequenced genomes of chinese strains 05zyh <dig> and 98hah <dig>  as well as european strain p1/ <dig>  containing deletions and insertions of hundreds of genes . thus, it appears that strain 89/ <dig> has evolved differently and acquired distinct sets of genes that contribute to its virulence, which accounts for its distinct clinical presentation and epidemiology compared to the european and asian strains.

collectively, our analysis indicates that the ss <dig> genome is highly polymorphic, which may reflect the organism's host specificity and clinical manifestation and provides information on the evolution of this important pathogen. a recent comparative genomic analysis indicates that gene gain is the major evolutionary force of streptococcal species, among which s. suis is the greatest lineage  <cit> . it is apparent that during the course of evolution, ss <dig> strains are under the highest level of positive selection pressure and have acquired foreign genes, mainly through the mechanism of hgt , to better adapt to host environments. the emergence of a new, highly virulent ss <dig> strain capable of causing stss during the two outbreaks in china is the latest example of such adaptive evolution. moreover, massive genomic rearrangement is also attributable to the evolutionary driving force of s. suis strains, as evidenced by the shotgun sequencing of the avirulent strain 05has <dig>  which shows that large genomic rearrangements occurred between avirulent and virulent ss <dig> strains .

based on the results of the current study, we propose a model of the microevolution of ss <dig> strains , which provides a framework for future investigations. although the model remains to be confirmed, it is reasonable to assume that the common ancestor of ss <dig> underwent significant genomic rearrangements to form avirulent and virulent populations for the colonization and exploitation of novel niches. thereafter, the avirulent and virulent lineages acquired divergent genes to improve their abilities to survive and evolve independently into the currently prevailing strains.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, significant genomic polymorphisms in ss <dig> populations were uncovered by the roche nimblegen cgs technique followed by pcr analysis, despite the fact that this dna microarray-based method can only detect known gene sequences. the virulent strains isolated in china during the two stss outbreaks are highly homologous, and the other virulent and avirulent strains are significantly polymorphic, which is consistent with the epidemiology and clinical presentation of these strains. the 89k fragment, a candidate pai in the chinese stss-causing isolates, was found to be partially included in the other virulent and avirulent strains. in total, only  <dig> genes in the 89k pai are unique to the stss-causing strains. the abc-type export systems encoded by these genes may represent an alternative virulence mechanism for the catastrophic features of toxic shock. in addition, a few presumptive virulence genes present in the virulent but not avirulent lineage were characterized. the presence of plcr, lipase, sortases, the pilus proteins, the revs response regulator, the ctsr regulator, and other transcriptional regulators may be important in the pathogenicity of ss <dig> 

our data also indicate that ss <dig> strains have highly divergent genomes. during evolution, ss <dig> strains have acquired many genes of foreign origin, mainly via mobile genetic elements, to better adapt to host environments. moreover, massive genomic rearrangement appears to be another evolutional force in ss <dig> strains. based on the current study, we propose a model of the microevolution of ss <dig> strains, which provides a framework for future investigations. this whole-genome comparative analysis has provided new insight into the pathogenicity and evolution of ss <dig> and may contribute to the development of potential therapies and novel preventive measures to control ss <dig> infections.
