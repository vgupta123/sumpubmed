BACKGROUND
influenza viruses are a major cause of infections in humans, with a dynamic history characterized by common seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. the evolution of the virus during and in between these outbreaks is difficult to describe because it undergoes rapid evolution in order to evade the constantly adapting immune response of their hosts  <cit> . the influenza a genome consists of eight individual segments of single stranded, negative sense rna, each containing a single gene  <cit> . the segmented nature of the genome allows for the exchange of entire genes between different viral strains when they co-infect the same cell through the process of reassortment  <cit> . two viruses co-infecting a cell could potentially generate  <dig> genotypes. reassortment is particularly interesting because it is an event that can quickly generate influenza strains with novel infectious properties  <cit> . the most recent pandemic in  <dig> provides a fresh example of a reassortant h1n <dig> strain that arose to claim an infectious ability of global scale  <cit> . in fact, three of the most recent pandemics have been caused by reassortant influenza a strains   <cit> . li and colleagues generated all the possible reassortants from two h5n <dig> and h3n <dig> strains and found that 72% of all the new subtypes replicate differently to the parental strains whereas 28% were not viable  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> reassortants were more pathogenic in mice than the parental h5n <dig>  these results underline the importance that reassortment plays in the evolution of influenza viruses and how essential it is to be able to describe these events. identification of new reassortants is a crucial step in understanding viral evolution and preferential reassortment patterns, in working towards preventing infections with and spread of fatal viruses.

phylogenetic trees depict hypotheses of evolutionary relationships between species or sequences  <cit> . if no reassortment events have occurred in the history of a set of sequences, then, allowing for phylogenetic error and stochastic effects, we expect that their respective phylogenetic trees will display overall congruence. more formally stated, we have a null hypothesis that a single phylogenetic tree  best fits all regions of the genome. the alternative hypothesis is that some part of the genome fits an alternative phylogenetic tree better and this is sufficient to overcome our initial expectation of a single tree - thereby rejecting the null hypothesis in frequentist terms, or overcoming our prior in bayesian terms. reassortment events, therefore, can be identified in those cases where genetic segments from the same isolate occupy different positions on the phylogenetic trees inferred from these segments  <cit> . in many studies up to now, the assumption has been made that if two phylogenetic trees differ, it is because reassortment has caused them to be different  <cit> . while phylogenetic incongruence may be caused by real differences in evolutionary history, it can also be the result of evolutionary model misspecification  <cit> , high levels of homoplasy  <cit> , long branch attraction  <cit> , inadequate sampling  <cit>  or separating data into partitions  <cit> . therefore, if we wish to understand the frequency and nature of reassortment we must have methods for distinguishing between topological inconsistency on phylogenetic trees that can be accounted for by confounding effects and topological inconsistency that is due to reassortment. a reassortment event is more easily detected if the two strains involved in producing the reassortant are sufficiently divergent in their sequences. reassortment between very similar strains is likely to go undetected by most, if not all, methods. at its most extreme, consider the instance where reassortment has involved two identical parental strains. this event cannot be detected using a computational approach but it is also not relevant in a biological context, as we would expect the identical gene segments to have identical properties. in addition to the detection of the existence of reassortment events, it is desirable to be able to identify the direction of reassortment – the likely origin of genetic segments in a reassortant strain - and also the frequency with which particular segments reassort. this information can be translated into an understanding of overall reassortment pathways and can be used to make predictions about future reassortment events.

in order to accomplish the objective of adequately reconstructing reassortment events in influenza, it is necessary to have a robust statistical platform, based on evaluating the differences between phylogenetic trees derived from different viral genome segments. in this paper we assess reassortment by the evaluation of the significance of the differences between phylogenetic trees constructed from different genome segments. if phylogenetic trees constructed from distinct segments are non-trivially different , the occurrence of one or more reassortment events may be the best explanation of this divergence. if the differences between phylogenetic trees are trivial, say, when they can be accounted for by invoking error in tree estimation as an explanation, it is appropriate to assume that no reassortment has taken place. we acknowledge however, that even though we might reject the null hypothesis , there can be situations where this is not correct. we do not have a method for discovering the false rejection rate and indeed it is unlikely to be discoverable using current technology.

the robinson-foulds  distance  <cit>  and subtree transfer distances   <cit>  are two methods of measuring dissimilarity when comparing trees. counting how many bipartitions in one tree are not shared with the other tree gives a value of the rf distance between two trees. however, this metric treats each feature of the tree equally and as a result, trees that agree in an important area can be given a large tree distance  <cit> . an spr operation on a tree consists of pruning a subtree by cutting an edge, and then regrafting the subtree by the same cut edge to a new vertex  <cit> . it can be said that two trees are close together if one can be obtained from the other by a small number of spr operations  <cit> . the “cut and paste” nature of this operation resembles the effect caused by reassortment events. therefore, identifying the minimum number of spr operations to convert one phylogenetic tree into another can describe the minimum number of reassortment events that have occurred in the history of the strains being studied. the eeep   <cit>  algorithm can be used to achieve this objective in a very short time. eeep works in a pairwise manner: it uses a reference and a test tree to construct the ‘edit path’ between them, or the spr operations needed to convert the reference tree to the test tree. choosing this fast algorithm for the calculation of edit paths resulted in a pairwise approach to the reassortment problem, the outcomes of which are combined at a later stage in the analysis.

not all differences in phylogenetic tree topology need to invoke reassortment events as the explanation. determining whether the topologies produced by spr modifications are significantly different to the starting tree, requires a statistical model for the variation of the features of the tree  <cit> . tests such as the bootstrap probability  <cit> , kishino-hasegawa  <cit> , and the approximately unbiased  test  <cit>  are used to assess confidence in phylogenetic hypotheses. in order to determine whether trees represent significantly different hypotheses based on a particular dataset, the au test has been used  <cit> . this test uses a multi-scale bootstrap technique that consists of generating sets of bootstrap replicates with varying sequence lengths and estimating the au p-value from the change in the bootstrap probability values along the changing sequence length  <cit> . given a set of trees and an alignment of sequences, the resulting p-value for each tree reflects how well that particular topology describes the given data. the au test has some desirable properties. the use of an explicit model of sequence evolution in order to reconstruct the history of a segment of dna is an important step in understanding virus evolution. in addition, the au test has a robust statistical platform on which to evaluate the significance of the difference between sets of phylogenetic trees. in our analyses, we have used the au test for the sets of trees produced by the eeep program for each pairwise analysis.

we present two automated methods to assess the significance of difference between phylogenetic trees and we use these methods to test whether reassortment occurred in a simulated dataset as well as a small collection of influenza viruses isolated in hong kong in  <dig>  the first method  applies subtree pruning and regrafting  modifications on maximum likelihood trees and the au test to identify significant differences in tree topologies. the second method  uses a bayesian approach, together with multidimensional scaling and spr, to identify the most frequent spr operations that connect two significantly different sets of trees. reconciliation of topologies is sought between all pairs of maximum likelihood trees derived from the eight influenza genetic segments. the steps required to reconcile two trees, starting with one tree  and perturbing its topology to obtain the other tree , involve subtree pruning and regrafting operations. we only infer reassortment events for those sprs that are found by both methods as a conservative approach. although one method may be found to perform better than the other, for now we have opted to focus on consistency across methods. we propose this kind of approach as a way of evaluating the nature of reassortment in influenza and other segmented viruses.

RESULTS
reassortment is a process that results in conflicting phylogenetic hypotheses derived from their respective gene segments. our overall aim is to detect real reassortment events that have occurred in a set of influenza isolates. we apply these algorithms to a small set of influenza sequences as well as a simulated data set. the enormous complexity of influenza virus evolutionary history cannot reasonably be explored in this manuscript, so instead we present exemplar datasets and describe how the approaches work. we also suggest future improvements that would be useful for a thorough understanding of the complex nature of reassortment networks.

simulated data
in order to test the ability of our methods to identify manually induced reassortment events, we carried out a straightforward analysis using simulated data . eight alignments, each containing seven sequences, were simulated under a common phylogenetic hypothesis . the lengths of these alignments corresponded to the lengths of the eight influenza a virus segments. in order to induce a situation where reassortment is imitated, the ha alignment was then simulated again, this time using a different phylogenetic tree topology. this hypothesis specifically contained a manually introduced reassortment event involving taxon ‘g’.

we inferred phylogenetic trees for all the eight segments using the gtr model of evolution. for mlreassort, maximum likelihood trees were obtained for each segment . in order to evaluate the significance of the differences between pairs of maximum likelihood tree topologies, we used the eeep  algorithm  <cit>  in combination with the au test to first of all define the best way of using spr edits to convert one tree into another via the fewest moves and subsequently to evaluate whether any of these edits result in statistically significant changes in tree topology. once the spr edits and resulting tree topologies are obtained, the au test is used to estimate confidence intervals around trees. non-overlapping confidence intervals indicate that the trees included in the sets are significantly different to each other. spr operations connecting trees with significantly different topologies are referred to as significant operations/transitions/branch swaps, and they are depicted on the maximum likelihood tree for each segment . the direction of arcs, pointing from the end with an empty circle  to filled circle  indicates the direction of transfer. for the simulated data, all significant branch swaps involved taxon ‘g’. using the ha alignment  and the gtr model of evolution, a ha tree was obtained  with a negative log likelihood of  <dig> . mlreassort proposes a branch swap on the ha tree to reconcile it with the other seven trees . after applying this spr to the ha tree, the negative log likelihood increases by  <dig>  . this means that the tree obtained after the spr modification provides a worse explanation of the ha data than the tree before the spr modification.

breassort uses a bayesian-based approach for tree reconstruction. the result of a bayesian mcmc sampling of parameter space, including tree space, is a set of phylogenetic trees. in order to detect reassortment, we developed a method for comparing these sets. one way of achieving a meaningful comparison of two sets of trees that are derived from two different alignments is to evaluate tree ‘distances’, both within and between the two sets, in geometric space  <cit> , with each point in this space representing a phylogenetic tree. using a standard statistical method, convex hull peeling  <cit> , we arranged the points into convex hulls. eliminating the 5% outliers in each set of trees using convex hull peeling, we carried out pairwise comparisons of the remaining 95% of trees. the pairs of bayesian tree sets all overlap, with the exception of cases in which ha is involved. the set of ha trees does not overlap with the sets of trees for mp, na, np, ns, pa, pb <dig> and pb <dig>  this kind of situation might indicate that the genes have different evolutionary histories, but could also be caused by stochastic effects as might be expected, for instance, if the alignments were short. therefore, for those cases where the sets of trees do not overlap, we randomly selected  <dig> trees from each segment’s tree space. we then carried out eeep analyses in order to find branch swaps that connect the trees in the two sets. spr edits that were found in more than 70% of cases were considered significant. the results of these comparisons are summarized using a network diagram, where each node represents the set of trees from an mcmc bayesian analysis for its corresponding segment . the edges between the nodes correspond to the proposed spr modifications, and the direction  is towards the trees being modified. edges of the same colour show the same spr operation, as shown in the legend.

in inferring reassortment events, we have opted for a conservative approach that uses consistency across both mlreassort and breassort . the ha tree proposes that all the other seven trees should be altered by moving taxon ‘g’ to cluster with taxon ‘b’ . on the other hand, segments mp, na, np, ns, pa, pb <dig> and pb <dig> propose that an spr transition on the ha tree, which would involve moving taxon ‘g’ to group with taxon ‘f’ , is required in order to reconcile the trees. this modification would result in a topology that would resemble the original ha tree, before the manual introduction of the modification. interpreting the output in the light of all the results, it makes sense to infer that the ha tree, rather than seven other trees, has a ‘wrong’ topology. this would imply that taxon ‘g’ has an ha segment that is inconsistent in its evolution with the other seven genes. if this was a real viral data it would mean that ‘g’ is a reassortant strain that has acquired a ha segment from a ‘b’-like strain. therefore, the spr move manually introduced into the ha tree by moving taxon ‘g’ to group with ‘b’ , has been recovered by both algorithms. this result suggests that the algorithm described can accurately detect manually induced reassortment events. this is not a stringent test of the methods and more complex scenarios such as those involving multiple reassortant viruses will be more difficult to detect, however, the approach can also be shown to work well with small datasets of real viral data.

real data
nucleotide alignments were obtained for influenza a sequences isolated in hong kong in  <dig> and whose lengths ranged from  <dig> aligned positions for ns to  <dig>  positions for pb <dig> and pb <dig> . first we carried out a number of analyses in order to assess whether the data were suitable for phylogenetic analysis using standard phylogenetic methods. all alignments passed the permutation tail probability  test  <cit>  . likelihood mapping analyses  <cit>  showed that over 94% of quartets are fully resolved . the test for intra-segment recombination  produced p-values that range from  <dig>  to  <dig> . at p-value cut off of  <dig> , the null hypothesis  is not rejected by most of the segments, except for ns . however, before eliminating three of the four near identical  environmental sequences isolated in  <dig>  the p-value for the alignment was  <dig> , well above the threshold level. this segment passes other recombination tests such as nss and maxchi <dig> and therefore we think that the lower phi p-value for the ns is likely to be due to stochastic effects. given that the data seems to be amenable to phylogenetic analysis, we conducted an analysis of reassortment. in order to construct phylogenetic trees for each gene, a model that best describes the evolution of the sequences was selected. we evaluated compositionally heterogeneous models, implemented in p <dig>  <cit>  and found that they did not significantly improve the likelihood of the data  and therefore, we carried out all analyses using compositionally homogeneous models. the homogeneous models of nucleotide substitution  and the maximum likelihood scores for the best trees  are shown in table  <dig>  the strain a/redknot/nj/325/ <dig> h7n <dig> was used as the outgroup in all phylogenetic trees.

the robinson-foulds  distance used to carry out an initial analysis of the extent to which the maximum likelihood tree topologies for each segment were different . this test says nothing about the significance of the differences between these trees; it is simply a measure of the degree to which they have bipartitions in common. the number of partitions present in one tree but not in another range from  <dig>  to  <dig> . for those trees that manifested conflict, we evaluated the shortest edit paths required in order to reconcile their topologies, using the eeep algorithm and the au test . as outlined earlier, these rearrangements mimic reassortment events. in total,  <dig> pairwise comparisons of tree topologies were carried out. four of these cases involved identical trees making any inference of reassortment unnecessary. the confidence intervals around trees, estimated using the au test, overlap in twenty-four cases. while we have done many independent  tests, the number of trees in each test is quite small . we have corrected these p values using the benjamini and hochberg  <cit>  test  and note that the correction has little impact on the resulting confidence intervals . this means that for these  <dig> tree pairs, the topological differences can be accounted for by stochastic errors; 46%  of cases with non-overlapping confidence regions remained. significant edits  between trees with non-overlapping confidence regions were determined and depicted on each ml tree . in the cases where the arcs are bidirectional, the source and recipient taxa cannot be determined with certainty. bayesian phylogenetics  was also used to infer the evolutionary histories of each segment, by carrying out  <dig> pairwise comparisons of sets of trees using 95% confidence intervals . in 57%  of cases the two sets of trees do not overlap, which indicates that the trees in one set cannot be used to explain the data from which the trees in the other set are derived. the analysis was repeated using different thresholds  for determining confidence intervals . small variations in the networks are expected to occur due to the reduction of multi-dimensional space to 2d, and the arbitrary choice of trees to compare from each convex hull. however, consistent signals were identified irrespective of the analyses, and variations between different ci thresholds are not greater than those observed when repeating the analysis with the same parameters. the findings from both algorithms are discussed below, starting with the example of a specific pair of segments: ns  and na .

the models of evolution selected for the two datasets are tvm+i for ns and gtr+i  <cit>  for na . for mlreassort, the rf distance between the resulting ml trees is six . three equally optimal edit paths were found between the ml trees derived from the two segments . a minimum of two spr operations is necessary to convert the ns tree into the na tree and vice versa. using the au test, an hypothesis can be rejected if the difference in tree topology is not greater than might be expected by chance. the au test therefore allowed us to estimate the confidence intervals for the ns and na trees. the trees found inside ns’ confidence interval are not significantly different to ns , whereas the trees found outside this interval are significantly worse at explaining the ns data. that is, the difference between a tree found within the ns confidence set and one found outside this space is best explained by real differences in evolutionary history. this difference is described by an spr operation that is considered significant . among the three calculated edit paths, a few significant spr operations were found . we consider the shortest  corresponding to moving taxon a/hongkong/1073/ <dig> h9n <dig>  and grouping it with taxon a/hongkong/1774/ <dig> h3n <dig> . the trees involved in this edit path are depicted in figure  <dig>  the start  tree is shown together with the trees t <dig> and t <dig> resulting from applying the suggested spr operations . it is important to note the increase in negative log likelihood after applying the second operation  on the t <dig> tree. the resulting tree  is significantly different to the ns tree, as it is also illustrated in the confidence intervals diagram . the reassortment network resulting from breassort depicts the move of taxon hk <dig> to group with hk <dig> by orange edges . it can be noted that some spr proposals appear much more abundantly than others .

although it may be that one algorithm performs better than the other, for now we will concentrate on those spr edits recovered by both algorithms . an spr modification that involves clustering a/hongkong/1073/ <dig> h9n <dig>  with a/hongkong/1774/ <dig> h3n <dig>  was found by both algorithms . this move causes a significant change in the likelihood value for the ns’ tree given the data  and is the topology that is proposed by the na tree, where these strains group together. the two viruses possess an na surface protein of type n <dig> , explaining why they cluster together in the na tree. since the na tree pairs hk <dig> and hk <dig> together, it proposes this grouping for most of the other trees  . for the ha tree, either the hk <dig> or hk <dig> taxa can be moved , whereas for mp, np, ns, pb <dig> and pb <dig>  the hk <dig> branch needs to be pruned and regrafted onto hk <dig> in order to reconcile the topologies. in the network diagram, the na segment proposes grouping hk <dig> with hk <dig> in mp, np, ns, pb <dig> and pb <dig> . given that hk <dig> is at the expected position in the na tree, we must hypothesize that the evolutionary history of the other segments belonging to the h9n <dig> isolate is in conflict with that of na. therefore, hk <dig> could be a reassortant strain that acquired the na segment of an h3n2-like virus, and the rest of the segments from other sources.

another significant spr modification  involves grouping hk <dig> with a/pheasant/hongkong/sh39/ <dig> h6n <dig> . a general trend can be seen where the majority of trees suggest this modification for the ha and na trees. the topologies of the six internal segments show hk <dig>  clustering with the h6n <dig> group, whereas this is not the case with the two external viral proteins, ha  and na  . also, the network diagram indicates this spr modification for the ha and na trees . this scenario indicates one or more reassortment events where hk <dig> is formed by acquiring gene segments encoding internal proteins from a h6n <dig> virus, or one with the same composition of genes. it was reported previously that this h9n <dig> isolate shares the same six internal segments with h5n <dig> and h9n <dig> strains circulating in  <dig>  <cit> , as well as with h6n <dig>  <dig> strains  <cit> . another significant spr modification involves moving sh <dig> to cluster with the quail isolates  of type h6n <dig> , suggested by the ha tree only. this grouping is altered in the internal segments’ trees by the presence of the hk <dig> isolate, resulting in sh <dig> being an outgroup of the quail99/hk <dig> clade  or a sister clade to hk <dig> . the result reinforces the hypothesis that the hk <dig> is a reassortant in the h6n <dig> group.

the proposed scenario is that hk <dig> is a reassortant virus that is made up of internal gene segments derived from h6n <dig> viruses , an na from a h3n2-like virus, and a ha from another h <dig> virus. the segments resulting in this genome architecture could have been incorporated into this virus at the same time in one reassortment event, or this could have occurred in many stages. a possibility is that hk <dig> first acquired an na segment from an hxn <dig> strain , internal segments from an h6n1-like virus that circulated in  <dig> and a ha segment from either parent, generating an intermediate type. this newly formed strain would be involved in another event that gave rise to the hk <dig> reassortant by acquiring a ha segment from an h9nx virus . previous work  <cit>  suggests that the h9n <dig> viruses isolated in hong kong in  <dig> shared the segments encoding for internal proteins with the h6n <dig> and h5n <dig> viruses of that year. also, lin and colleagues  <cit>  report that the hk <dig> strain itself has not picked up any segments by reassortment since  <dig> and that it is closely related to a/quail/hongkong/g1/ <dig>  this leads us to believe that the  <dig> precursor of hk <dig> is the first reassortant strain with this genetic make up from which the  <dig> isolates were generated. influenza h9n <dig> strains in general have been observed to possess a high propensity for reassortment  <cit> .

it is expected that the outgroup strain would not be involved in any reassortment events . however, there are some spr operations that incorporate this sequence, which could point to reassortment events with other strains that were not included in our dataset. none of the branch swaps involving the outgroup strain appear in the results from both algorithms, therefore we didn’t consider them. another spr  was found by both algorithms , but there is little agreement on which segments propose this move. the ha tree disagrees with the pb <dig> tree on the grouping of the hk <dig> and env <dig> strains. it seems that these two gene segments have evolved separately, however there is not enough information to hypothesise how this may have happened and what is the source of the other segments.

in the reassortment network, the pa node is not connected by edges to any other nodes . poorly supported branches in the phylogenetic topology can cause this effect. another challenge is to determine which spr operations are complementary to each other and this can only be done in the context of all the other trees. one of the limitations with eeep is memory consumption  <cit>  but most paths in pairwise comparisons were recovered. the main drawback in using an individual phylogeny as a starting point for the algorithm is the potential of wrongly inferring reassortment events if the start topology is incorrect. comparing bayesian phylogenetic tree sets in geometrical space is one way of approaching the comparison of large sets of trees. mds was found useful in comparing multiple bayesian analyses and for exploring sets of trees  <cit> . however, its challenges include information loss during the scaling of distances into lower dimensions of space and defining tree space from a limited number of trees. another approach could consist of constraining the mcmc tree search by using another segment’s topology, and using bayes factors  <cit>  to determine whether one hypothesis describes the data significantly better than the other. nevertheless, the algorithms presented here have the potential to detect real reassortment events by minimising the inference of false positives.

CONCLUSIONS
two statistical frameworks for identifying reassortment events using phylogeny are presented. the first algorithm  uses a maximum likelihood approach. here we identify the shortest path  for converting a phylogenetic tree derived from gene a to the tree derived from gene b. an spr operation is evaluated as significant when the resulting tree has a significantly lower likelihood score compared to the pre-modified tree. this was carried out for all the pairwise comparisons of trees and interpretation of results is done considering all the trees and the proposed spr modifications. the second algorithm is based on a bayesian approach . the steps consist of identifying non-overlapping tree spaces, detecting spr moves that would convert trees from the tree space of gene a to trees from that of gene b , and focusing on the most frequent branch swaps. the spr operations that are considered to result in significant changes in tree topology are events that cannot be simply explained by errors in the phylogenetic estimation and, having rejected the hypothesis of recombination, reassortment needs to be considered. we use a conservative approach when inferring reassortment events by only considering those sprs that are found by both algorithms. further work will involve development of the algorithm for use on larger data sets. as the size of the data set increases, it is likely that more reassortant strains would be included and a better way of representing the results would also be necessary. nevertheless, the algorithms presented are able to detect reassortment events in any segmented viruses, using statistical methods for distinguishing between true reassortment and other causes of incongruence between phylogenetic tree topologies.

automated computational methods for detecting reassortment events have been explored previously and these involve or avoid the use of phylogenetic analysis. suzuki’s phylogenetic approach  <cit>  is based on examining quartets of strains; the fluref  <cit>  algorithm selects candidate reassortment groups through a bottom-up search of phylogenetic trees, and another approach combines genotyping and phylogenetics to infer reassortment events  <cit> . recently, nagarajan and kingsford  <cit>  reported giraf, a graph-incompatibility-based reassortment finder. the program involves the generation of an incompatibility graph from sets of trees resulting from a bayesian tree search, followed by mining of phylogenetic discordances using a search algorithm. in contrast with our algorithm, giraf can be used to process large datasets efficiently. in addition to the detection of reassortment events, giraf also reports a measure of confidence for each prediction. rabadan et al. have developed a statistical method to estimate the likelihood that two segments have co-evolved, without relying on phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . another algorithm based on the theory of quasispecies was reported by wan et al.  <cit> , where using segment genotype thresholds allowed the identification of reassortment events. macken and colleagues  <cit>  established a baseline of circulating genotypes at a certain time period, and used it to characterize reassortment events of viruses from a second time period. another algorithm based on neighbourhood of strains for each segment  <cit>  was developed to detect reassortment in all the unique full genomes available until june  <dig>  mds has also been used to identify differences in influenza a phylogenetic history. rambaut et al.  <cit>  used mds to plot the distances between  <dig> trees for segments derived from h3n <dig> isolates. in this case, the tree distances were calculated from the time to the most recent common ancestor for each season. although some of these methods are more efficient in processing large datasets, we believe that our approaches provide a sensitive and accurate test for the detection of reassortment events.
