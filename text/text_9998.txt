BACKGROUND
diatoms are eukaryotic, unicellular, photosynthetic organisms that inhabit marine and fresh waters worldwide and are responsible for about 40% of the total carbon fixation in oceans  <cit> . their high productivity compared to other primary producers is likely the main base of the world's marine food webs, allowing a reduced trophic fractionation, and sustaining even top-level marine predators like cetaceans  <cit> . diatoms are surrounded by a peculiar cell wall with intricate micro- and nano-structured biosilica patterns. the assembly of specific silica shell patterns for the different diatom species is under genetic control, being reliably reproduced on each cell division  <cit> . thalassiosira pseudonana is a centric diatom inhabiting marine ecosystems which has been a target organism for studies focusing on diatom biosilica formation  <cit> , the molecular effects of copper toxicity  <cit>  and nutrient limitation, temperature or ph effects  <cit> . in  <dig>  the whole genome of t. pseudonana was published  <cit>  and soon after, the genome sequencing of two other diatom organisms has been described  <cit> 

the available genomic information for these diatom species, associated with the important role they play in the carbon fixation in oceans, paved the way for their use as model organisms in molecular ecotoxicology studies. thus, our laboratory has designed a dna microarray chip containing all the available genes in t. pseudonana to identify gene biomarkers of exposure to stress conditions, including environmental pollutants. some pollutants which have been initially selected are the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons . pahs are persistent organic pollutants with a ubiquitous distribution in aquatic environments and are considered a major threat to marine and freshwater ecosystems  <cit> . several pahs were included in the priority list of the european union's water framework directive  because of their potential carcinogenic and mutagenic properties. previously, an axenic culture of t. pseudonana has been used to investigate the molecular effects of exposure to three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , both as single compounds and as a mixture  <cit> . by studying the expression of selected genes by quantitative real-time pcr , a few genetic biomarkers of exposure to pahs have been described  <cit> . recently, we have extended the gene expression analysis to the entire t. pseudonana transcriptome by using our in-house microarray for exposure experiments to benzopyrene , a common pah compound. the regulated genes identified by dna microarray increase our understanding of the pathways involved in the cellular response to pah exposure conditions and allow the selection of some interesting genes to be used as molecular biomarkers of exposure to pahs in the environment. for this purpose, we have recently tested diatoms exposed to contaminated marine water sediments and confirmed the suitability of some genes as biomarkers in environmental monitoring studies  <cit> .

recent advances in shotgun proteomics and the use of isobaric labelling of peptides and proteins for the relative quantification of an entire organism or cell proteome under different experimental conditions offer promising tools for the discovery of biomarkers also at the protein level. we describe here a procedure for proteomic analysis of the diatom t. pseudonana using itraq labelling to identify proteins differentially expressed upon exposure to bap. the data obtained will be discussed in the context of the gene expression analysis performed in our laboratory under the same experimental conditions, as well as to the known effects of pahs in other organisms. ultimately, our goal is to use the molecular information gathered in this model organism, as indicators for the early assessment of the ecosystem health and predict the effects in higher eukaryotes of the same habitats. these molecular indicators alone or in combination with the common chemical analysis of pollutants in the environment should provide a better understanding of the endangerment level of an ecosystem to specific stress conditions.

RESULTS
effect of bap on diatom growth
to study the effects of bap exposure in diatoms at the molecular level, t. pseudonana cultures have been exposed for  <dig> h to  <dig>  μg/l bap or just to the methanol solvent . methanol at a final concentration of  <dig> %  was shown to induce no effect on the diatom growth. in control conditions, diatom cell density showed an increase by  <dig>  fold after  <dig> h . exposure of diatom cultures to bap for  <dig> h resulted in 30% growth inhibition relative to the control , which is consistent with what had been previously described  <cit> .

protein identification
protein extraction from three biological replicates, each consisting of both control and bap-exposed conditions, was carried out on consecutive days. additional file  <dig> shows the workflow followed in the present study, starting from the cell culture and exposure to bap up to ms/ms data analysis. the total amount of protein obtained was around  <dig> μg/million cells harvested from the control conditions, as compared with  <dig>  μg/million cells extracted from the bap-exposed conditions. simultaneous protein measurements in all the six samples  were performed to assure that the same amount of protein from each sample was taken for itraq labeling. in addition, both undigested and tryptic-digested samples were loaded on a sds-page to confirm both the protein amount and the complete digestion by trypsin . following scx separation of the pooled itraq-labeled samples and lc-ms/ms analysis, we were able to identify a total of  <dig> different proteins in the three biological replicates, based on one or more peptide hits per protein at >95% confidence. proteinpilot was used to search the complete t. pseudonana proteome database downloaded from uniprotkb/swiss-prot. following exclusion of proteins identified by a single peptide, the number of proteins identified decreased to  <dig> . the false discovery rate of peptide matches above identity threshold was  <dig> %. based on gene ontology classification, the major group of proteins identified is involved in translation, metabolic processes and photosynthesis . in addition, about 20% of the proteins identified in this study had no annotated function assigned to them.

protein quantification
itraq-mediated shotgun proteomics allows the relative quantification of peptides from up to eight samples simultaneously, and has proven to be a successful tool in protein biomarker discovery, both in the biomedical  <cit>  and environmental fields  <cit> .

different itraq reagents were used to distinguish peptides obtained from diatom cells cultured in control and bap-exposed conditions . protein quantification based on the relative amounts of the different itraq labels was obtained for all identified proteins based on two or more unique peptides, using both proteinpilot and mascot algorithms. the use of both algorithms allowed the identification of a higher number of regulated proteins, because of slight differences in peptide confidence levels and itraq-label quantification values acquired with the two programs. we then analyzed the data sets for changes in protein levels upon bap-exposure. the expression of a protein was considered as being regulated by bap treatment when it showed changes in expression beyond 20% , and with a p <  <dig>  calculated after a two-tailed unpaired statistical approach. following these criteria,  <dig> different proteins with two or more quantified peptides, showed regulation upon bap exposure. as listed in table  <dig>   <dig> proteins showed an up-regulation and  <dig> proteins a down-regulation. in addition, for those proteins with a significant regulation of at least 20% , but identified by a single peptide at >95% confidence, and for which other peptides had been identified at lower confidence, all individual spectra were analyzed manually, both for the fragmentation pattern and the relative intensity of the different itraq reporter ions. six proteins which showed a significant regulation considering all the peptides  were selected for inclusion in the potentially bap-regulated proteins . our decision to include these proteins in table  <dig> as "potentially regulated" is sustained by the risk of loosing otherwise important protein targets for follow-up studies, masked by the high variability existing in unsynchronized diatom cultures. it is even more relevant since for two of them, predicted nonf-related protein; dj-1/pfpi family  and silicon transporter  <dig> , a similar regulation has been confirmed at the gene expression level, by dna microarray . the regulated proteins were mainly involved in metabolism, photosynthesis and transport activities . figure  <dig> depicts an example of protein identification and quantification for a predicted c- <dig> cytosine-specific dna methylase . the b- and y- ion series in the tandem mass spectrometry spectra were used to identify the peptides. the itraq reporter ion peak areas of the four peptide fragments  were used to measure the relative amount of c- <dig> cytosine-specific dna methylase in bap-exposed  and control diatom cultures .

as expected, the quantification of itraq labels  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cluster on a principle component analysis  according to the conditions of exposure , i.e. control  vs bap-exposed . in addition, the quantification of itraq labels  <dig> and  <dig> cluster together on the pca and away from all other labels .

itraq labels  <dig> and  <dig> have been used to label untreated and bap-exposed conditions, respectively on an old diatom culture which was in resting phase. thus, when we subjected this culture to the same experimental procedure, no significant growth could be observed in the control and bap-exposed cultures after  <dig> h. this prevented the measurement of any bap-induced effect either as growth inhibition or as a difference in expression of the proteome, which underlines the importance of using cell cultures in exponential growth for the purpose of molecular biomarker discovery.

gene expression analysis of sit1
the identification of the silicon transporter  in our study as a potentially regulated protein after bap-treatment  was a very interesting finding, since bap and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been previously shown to regulate the gene expression of several silaffin proteins <cit> . silaffins are involved in the silica biomineralization of diatoms  <cit>  and rely on the availability of the silicon pool inside the cells, gathered through uptake from the environment by silicon transporters located at the membrane. in order to confirm the effect of bap on the silicon uptake by sit <dig> in t. pseudonana, suggested from the present proteomics study, we have designed specific primers to study the gene expression of this transporter by qrt-pcr. consistent with the proteomics results, also the expression of the sit <dig> gene showed a down-regulation in all the six biological replicates for bap exposure tested . in addition, when diatom cultures were exposed to a mixture of pahs extracted from an environmental contaminated site , with a bap concentration 20-fold lower as the one used in the present study, the expression of the sit <dig> gene still showed a decrease by qrt-pcr  <cit> .

discussion
since the publication of the entire genome sequence of t. pseudonana in  <dig>  <cit> , this eukaryotic algae has become a promising model organism to study stress responses in marine environments at the molecular level. diatom species are particularly relevant as model organisms because i) they are unicellular organisms easy to keep in culture, ii) they have a predominant role as primary producers, accounting for about 40% of the total carbon fixation in oceans and iii) any fluctuation at the population level of these organisms is expected to have major effects on the entire ecosystem  <cit> . in this study, diatom cultures have been exposed to bap, a common pah compound with carcinogenic and mutagenic properties, and found in several fresh water and salt water habitats, arising from various natural and anthropogenic sources. the major areas of concern for these pollutants are the estuarine, coastal zones, port areas and also enormous marine environmental areas due to navigation activities as well as to oil spill accidents. a previous report from our group had already unveiled some biological pathways involved in the diatom response to bap exposure, from the expression analysis of selected genes by qrt-pcr, including lipid metabolism and the biosilicification process  <cit> . the current report is part of a broader effort to identify biomarkers of exposure at both gene and protein expression level. currently, even with the available genome sequence of t. pseudonana, a deep understanding of the pathways involved in any response to stress conditions is hindered by the limited amount of information on the protein function. in fact, the available annotation on the function or metabolic pathways of most of the t. pseudonana proteins has been mainly deduced from sequence homology with other organisms and many are only predicted or putative proteins with no function assigned. so far, only few studies describing the function of selected proteins have been published e.g. the ones involved in the silicon uptake and biomineralization  <cit>  and specific cell-surface proteins potentially involved in the copper-induced stress response  <cit> . the need for comprehensive proteomics studies is therefore relevant for the purpose of compiling the entire translated pool of genes in this organism and to allow the build-up of metabolic or signaling pathways that could be involved in stress and adaptation-related responses. mass spectrometry analyses of t. pseudonana for the purpose of protein identification have previously been performed on a cell wall fraction, identifying a total of  <dig> proteins  <cit>  and recently on the whole-cell proteome, with the identification of  <dig> different proteins  <cit> . to our knowledge, the present data describe the first use of a quantitative proteomics approach in t. pseudonana, to identify potential protein biomarkers of exposure to stress conditions in this organism. however, only about 2% of the entries on the predicted diatom proteome database have been identified in this study, suggesting that further development of extraction and fractionation techniques are required to improve the identification of low abundant or membrane proteins. interestingly, around 14% of the identified proteins and 10% of the regulated proteins found in this study are annotated as predicted or putative proteins, which limits the assignment of the pathways involved in the response to bap exposure.

photosynthesis
three different proteins involved in photosynthetic processes show a down-regulation in bap-exposed samples, compared to control conditions. this finding is in agreement with previous reports on a harmful effect of bap and other pahs on the photosynthetic activity in plants  <cit> . one can speculate that a reduction in the diatoms photosynthesis caused by a pah contamination in oceans could result in a lower consumption of atmospheric carbon dioxide by diatoms and decrease the generated organic carbon. because diatoms are the contemporaneous dominant primary producers in marine environments, a reduction in their activity is likely to affect the marine food webs they sustain  <cit> .

dna methylation
gene methylation is an ancient property of eukaryotic genomes  <cit>  and is a source of epigenetic information, by providing instructions on how, where, and when the genetic information should be transcribed  <cit> . in mammalian cells, cytosine-specific methyltransferases methylate cpg sequences, which are believed to modulate gene expression and cell differentiation  <cit> . in the present study, a predicted c- <dig> cytosine-specific dna methylase, an enzyme which specifically methylates the c- <dig> carbon of cytosines in dna to produce c5-methylcytosine, revealed an up-regulation in the bap-exposed diatom cultures compared to control conditions. this finding is consistent with the recent dna microarray studies performed in our laboratory, where another putative dna methyltransferase also showed an up-regulation of gene expression . interestingly, variable degrees of overexpression of dna methyltransferases have been reported in tumor tissue  <cit> . changes in the dna methylation patterns in tumor cells often involve global hypomethylation of the genome accompanied by region-specific hyper-methylation events  <cit> . in addition, exposure to bap has been connected with a disruption in dna methylation in cancerous cells  <cit> . therefore, alterations at the level of dna methylation caused by bap exposure could be linked with the carcinogenic properties of this compound. in addition, this effect seems to be conserved in eukaryotes, strengthening further the use of t. pseudonana as a model organism to study general toxicity events.

lipid metabolism
due to its hydrophobic nature, pahs accumulate in lipidic environments such as membranes and are known to induce oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation  <cit> . from the candidate biomarkers found in the present study, the regulated long chain acyl coa synthetase protein  is involved in lipid metabolism, most likely belonging to the long-chain acyl coa synthetase family of enzymes, as deduced from sequence homology to other organisms. although there are no available studies on the catalytic activity of long-chain acyl-coa synthetase in diatoms; in mammals, they catalyze the formation of long-chain coa and amp from fatty acid, coa and atp, in a two step reaction that initiates cellular long-chain fatty acid metabolism  <cit> . in this study, the long chain acyl coa synthetase protein shows a 2-fold down-regulation upon exposure to bap. a similar down-regulation has been observed for an enzyme belonging to this family by dna microarray studies in adult zebrafish exposed to produced water components, which are rich in pahs  <cit> . in t. pseudonana, there are six predicted proteins belonging to the long-chain acyl-coa synthetase family  <cit> . the regulation of this pathway is further evidenced in a previous report that showed a regulation of another protein belonging to this family, the long-chain-fatty-acid--coa ligase  in the opposite direction. thus, an increased expression upon exposure to bap has been observed at the gene level, both by qrt-pcr  <cit>  and by dna microarray, as well as at the protein level, as seen by immunoassays <cit> .

the involvement of the lipid metabolism on the cellular response to bap exposure is further evidenced on a recent report in human macrophages where it was demonstrated that bap is able to trigger lipid accumulation in cellular compartments, including endosomes and lysosomes  <cit> . we can speculate that such increase in lipids could be involved in the more efficient sequestering of the hydrophobic bap, thus preventing the formation of dna adducts generated by bap metabolites. in mammalian cells, five different long-chain acyl-coa synthetase proteins have been described, with specific and sometimes overlapping substrates and subcellular localizations  <cit> . further studies would be necessary to uncover the potential functional differences, including substrate specificities, of this family of enzymes in the diatom species, which are likely to be regulated in different ways by bap exposure. despite the mechanism of action involved, it is clear that the cellular response to pahs in t. pseudonana include the regulation of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, in particular long-chain fatty acids. in addition, since this family of enzymes seems to be conserved across all phylogenetic branches, it is possible that a similar regulation may take place in other organisms.

silicon uptake and metabolism
one characteristic feature of diatoms is the silicified cell-wall or frustule that surrounds the plasma membrane  <cit>  which is assembled by the combined action of silaffin proteins and long-chain polyamines . silaffin 1-2l and silaffin  <dig> in t. pseudonana have been shown to directly catalyze silica polymerization and the activity of the different proteins determines the size and shapes of produced silica particles, as demonstrated from scanning electron microscopy analysis of distinct silaffin-lcpa mixtures  <cit> . maintenance of the diatom intracellular silicon pools requires the uptake of silicon from the aquatic environment through membrane silicon transporters. silicon transporter  <dig>  and silicon transporter  <dig>  have been previously shown to be associated with cell cycle events, with a gene expression peak in the s phase, concomitant with dna replication and cytokinesis  <cit> . the increase in sit expression likely raises the uptake of silicon from the environment, preceding the synthesis of new valves in the silica deposition vesicle  and exocytosis in the g2+m phase  <cit> .

in t. pseudonana cultures exposed to bap, we observe a down-regulation of sit <dig> , both at the protein level and gene expression level. interestingly, bap treatment also cause a reduction in the net silicon uptake per diatom cell, as determined by the measurement of silicon disappearance from the medium  <cit> . this finding suggests a direct link between bap treatment and a decrease in the available intracellular pools of silicon, presumably through a decrease in expression of sit <dig>  despite the strong amino acid identity between sit <dig> and sit <dig>   <cit> , the peptides identified in this study for sit <dig> correspond to regions not identical to both enzymes. therefore, no conclusion can be drawn on whether sit <dig> expression is also affected by bap treatment. previously, silicon limitation was shown to specifically down-regulate silaffin  <dig> expression  <cit> , as we also observe upon bap treatment  <cit> . it would be interesting to test whether the combined down-regulation of sit <dig>  the intracellular silicon limitation conditions, and the down regulation of sil <dig> caused by bap could affect the silicification process and the produced silica shell nanopatterns in t. pseudonana. for this purpose, it is likely that higher times of exposure than the  <dig> h used in the present study, and the establishment of cell synchronization prior to exposure would be required for the visualization of changes at the level of cell wall morphology by e.g. scanning electron microscopy .

CONCLUSIONS
using a quantitative proteomics approach based on itraq labeling of peptides, we could study protein expression changes in diatoms upon exposure to bap. despite the low protein identification rate achieved in our studies, we were able to select a set of  <dig> proteins with changes in expression. our data shows that the lipid metabolism and biosilicification processes are involved, as observed previously, but also unveils other potential pathways involved in the diatom exposure or in toxicity responses to bap, such as dna methylation and photosynthesis. these data, combined with gene expression analysis can help to elucidate pathway/metabolic processes involved in the mode of action of pollutants.
