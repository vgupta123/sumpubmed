BACKGROUND
in the past decade, several studies aimed to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of enzymatic hydrolysis of chitosan, a polycationic polysaccharide containing β- <dig>  linked residues of d-glucosamine  with a minor proportion of n-acetyl-d-glucosamine 
 <cit> . the chitosanase originating from streptomyces sp. n <dig> , which belongs to the glycoside hydrolases family  <dig> , is among the best characterized
 <cit> . this enzyme is an endo-type hydrolase and proceeds via an inverting mechanism in which glu <dig> acts as the general acid and asp <dig> as the general base/nucleophile
 <cit> . from a structural view, the csnn <dig> consists of two globular domains mainly constituted of α-helices. the connection of the two domains by a helix backbone generates the substrate binding cleft
 <cit> . the structural features of csnn <dig> are not only shared by gh <dig> members, but also by gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> lysozymes, as well as gh <dig> chitinases, all members of the “lysozyme superfamily”
 <cit> . this list could be extended toward gh <dig> family based on primary sequence similarities
 <cit> .

it is now generally recognized that some residues of the catalytic cleft of glycoside hydrolases, other than the catalytic residues, might play an essential role in enzyme action. such residues can be involved in enzyme-substrate interaction, in structure stabilisation, but also in the creation of interaction networks essential for catalysis
 <cit> . in csnn <dig>  examination of the microenvironment of the proton donor glu <dig> revealed that this glutamate does not work independently but requires assistance from an interaction network involving three other residues  to achieve efficient catalysis
 <cit> . similar networks have also been observed in other members of the lysozyme superfamily, bacillus circulans mh-k <dig> chitosanase , t <dig> lysozyme  and barley chitinase 
 <cit> . in order to verify if a similar kind of interaction is needed to sustain the catalytic potential of the general base residue, we examined the microenvironment of asp <dig> of csnn <dig> and found that an arginine  is highly conserved among the gh <dig> family of chitosanases. implication in the catalytic function of an arginine which lies in an analogous position has been reported in the bacillus circulans mh-k <dig> chitosanase
 <cit> . the present work clarifies the contribution of arg <dig> to the enzymatic activity of the streptomyces sp. n <dig> chitosanase.

 <cit> . the vector puc <dig>  was described previously
 <cit> . the shuttle vector pfdes, a derivative of pfd <dig>  was used as vector for expression of mutated chitosanase genes
 <cit> .

saturation mutagenesis of r <dig> residue
in order to facilitate the saturation mutagenesis procedure, derivatives of the previously described puc19-csnn <dig> and puc19-csnn174-d40g plasmids have been generated
 <cit> . these derivatives, named puc19-csnn174-an and puc19-csnn174-d40g-an, harboured two unique restriction sites ncoi and agei, respectively upstream and downstream from the arg <dig> codon. these sites have been created by silent mutagenesis, using the method involving polymerase chain reaction  performed with the easy-a® high-fidelity pcr cloning enzyme 
 <cit> . the mutated dna sequences were confirmed by dna sequencing.

site-specific saturation mutagenesis of the csnn <dig> arg <dig> codon was achieved by geneart inc.  using the puc19-csnn174-an or puc19-csn n174-d40g-an constructs as templates. variants of arg <dig> codon were created by introducing the synthetic ncoi/agei  <dig> bp fragments of the csnn <dig> gene  into puc19-csnn174-an or puc19-csnn <dig> d40g-an using ncoi and agei restriction sites. the final constructs were verified by sequencing at geneart inc . all arg <dig> mutants were transformed into e. coli strain xl10-gold ultracompetents cells. the csnn <dig> r42e, r42k, d40g+r42e and d40g+r42k mutated genes were expressed in s. lividans tk <dig>  each of these genes was excised from corresponding puc19-csnn174-an or puc19-csnn <dig> d40g-an construct by smai and hindiii digestion. the resulting  <dig> bp fragments encoding the mutated chitosanases were subcloned into the pfdes vector previously digested with scai and hindiii, and transformed into s. lividans tk <dig> for expression.

induction and isolation of recombinant chitosanases from e. coli cells
starter cultures of e. coli strain xl10-gold cells carrying the puc <dig>  puc19-csn wt or puc19-csnn <dig> r42x-an vectors were prepared by inoculating  <dig> ml of sterile luria broth supplemented with  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin and incubated overnight with shaking  at 37°c. then, cultures of  <dig> ml were inoculated with  <dig> ml of starter culture and incubated with shaking  at 37°c until optical density reached  <dig>  at  <dig> nm. iptg was added to a final concentration of  <dig> mm and the cultures were further incubated for  <dig>  hours at 37°c. the cells were harvested by centrifugation at  <dig> rpm at 4°c for  <dig> minutes. cell pellets were washed twice with  <dig> mm sodium acetate buffer  and suspended in  <dig> μl of buffer supplemented with complete® protease inhibitor cocktail  and transferred to fastprep® impact-resistant  <dig>  ml tubes  containing  <dig> mg of  <dig>  mm glass beads. cell disruption was carried out in ice bath using fast prep® fp <dig> cell disrupter  for  <dig> sec at  <dig>  m/sec speed. after centrifugation , the supernatant was assayed for protein concentration and chitosanase activity. protein concentration was determined according to bradford
 <cit>  using bovine serum albumin as standard. all the induction experiments were done in triplicate.

chitosanase assay in proteins extracts from e. coli cells
chitosanase activity in protein extracts was determined as described
 <cit>  except that the reaction time was of  <dig> min. comparisons of chitosanase activity among the wild-type and arg42-mutated enzymes were made with anova test  followed by a dunnett’s post test.

chitosanase purification and assay
wild-type, d40g, r42e, r42k, d40g+r42e and d40g+r42k chitosanases were purified from recombinant s. lividans tk <dig> culture supernatants as previously described
 <cit> . chitosanase and protein assays were as described
 <cit> . specific activities were determined at a single chitosan concentration .

kinetic parameters were determined using chitosan as substrate at 37°c in  <dig> mm sodium acetate buffer .  <dig>  ml reaction mixtures were set up containing  <dig> to  <dig> different concentrations  of chitosan in  <dig> replicas using micro-titer plates. protein concentration and reaction time were adjusted to obtain similar overall hydrolysis levels for all studied proteins. reaction time was of  <dig> min for wild-type or of  <dig> min for d40g, r42e and r42k. release of reducing sugars was monitored as described previously
 <cit> . km, kcat and ki values were calculated by nonlinear regression, fitting the experimental data to the enzyme kinetic-substrate inhibition equation in prism software 
 <cit> :

 y=vmax*x/km+x*1+x/ki 

the effect of the degree of n-deacetylation of chitosan on wild-type, r42e and r42k chitosanases specific activities was studied using chitosans with varying degrees of n-deacetylation as substrates at a constant concentration of  <dig> μg/ml in  <dig> replicas. reaction time was of  <dig> min for wild-type or of  <dig> min for r42e and r42k. release of reducing sugars was monitored as described previously
 <cit> . chitosans of degree of n-deacetylation of 97%, 94% and 86% were obtained respectively from shanghai freeman americas , marinard biotech  and ism biopolymer . chitosan of degrees of n-deacetylation of 86%, 72%, 65% and 62% were obtained by treating chitosan from sigma-aldrich  with acetic anhydride, as described
 <cit> . the degree of n-deacetylation of all chitosan samples was determined by 1h-nmr
 <cit> .

enzymatic reaction samples for the real-time mass spectrometric assay
hydrolysis reaction with wild-type and mutant csnn174
samples were prepared in duplicate using  <dig> mm ammonium acetate  aqueous solutions containing  <dig> nm wild-type csnn <dig>   <dig>  nm r42e mutant,  <dig>  nm r42k mutant, respectively, and  <dig>  μm  <dig>  each experiment was immediately started by adding substrate to the enzyme solution. the data correction with ionization factors was performed as described previously
 <cit> .

concentrations of glucosamine dimer, trimer, tetramer, hexamer were determined from intensity counts of time-course graphs of  <dig> hydrolysis monitored by real-time mass spectrometry. oligomers concentration data obtained were corrected in order to fit the following mass-balance equation of glucosamine hexamer hydrolysis:

 6×glcn6initial=2×glcn2+3×glcn3+4×glcn4+6×glcn <dig> 

from these corrected concentrations, the frequencies proportions of symmetrical and asymmetrical cleavage of  <dig>  as well as the tetramer re-cleavage, at the stages of about  <dig> up to 80% of substrate consumption, were calculated as follows :

frequency of cleavage of tetramer:  = /3

frequency of symmetrical cleavage:  = / <dig> + /3

frequency of asymmetrical cleavage:  =  + frequency of “2+2” cleavage

mass spectrometric setup
directly after mixing substrate and enzyme, each mixture was filled into a syringe. the ‘reactor’ syringe  located in a syringe pump  infused the reaction mixture continuously at a flow rate of  <dig> μl/min  via an electrospray ionization source into the mass spectrometer like described previously
 <cit> . individual measurements were carried out at 20°c ± 2°c. the detection was performed in positive ionization mode with a time-of-flight  mass spectrometer from agilent , model  <dig> time-of-flight lc/ms. the most important ms parameters are 300°c drying gas temperature,  <dig> lh- <dig> drying gas flow rate,  <dig> psig nebulizer gas pressure,  <dig> v capillary voltage,  <dig> v skimmer voltage and  <dig> v fragmentor voltage, respectively. the mass-range was set to  <dig> –  <dig> m/z and data acquisition was  <dig>  cycles/sec. for the system control and data acquisition an agilent technologies  software was used , edition: june, 2004).

thermal unfolding experiments
thermal unfolding experiments in presence or absence of 3
to obtain the thermal unfolding curve of the enzyme protein, the cd value at  <dig> nm was monitored, while the solution temperature was raised at a rate of 1°c/min by a temperature controller . the buffer used was  <dig> mm sodium acetate buffer, ph  <dig> . the final concentrations were  <dig>  μm for the enzyme and  <dig>  mm for  <dig>  to facilitate comparison between unfolding curves, the experimental data were normalized as follows. the fraction of unfolded protein at each temperature was calculated from the cd value by linearly extrapolating the pre- and post-transition baselines into the transition zone, and plotted against the temperature. assays were performed in duplicate. thermodynamic parameters could not be obtained, because of the poor reversibility of the unfolding transition.

thermal unfolding experiments in presence or absence of chitosan
intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was used to measure the folding state of chitosanases. thermal unfolding curves were obtained as previously described
 <cit> . sufficient quantities of chitosanase  were added to 4-ml quartz cuvette to obtain 900– <dig> relative fluorescence unit . the buffer used was  <dig> mm sodium acetate buffer, ph  <dig> . chitosan was used at the final concentration of  <dig> μg/ml.

RESULTS
choice of arg <dig> for site-specific saturation mutagenesis
to find out if there were any residues that could possibly assist asp <dig> to achieve its function as catalytic general base, we first examined the 3d structure of the catalytic cleft of streptomyces sp. n <dig> chitosanase 
 <cit> . it resulted that asp <dig> is located very close to the side chain of arg42: the nϵ atom of the guanidyl substituent in arg <dig> is  <dig>  Å from the oδ <dig> atom of the asp <dig> carboxylate group. also, the side chain of arg <dig> points towards the catalytic cleft of the chitosanase .
 <cit> . catalytic residues: glu <dig> , asp <dig> . relevant interatomic distances in Å are indicated by interrupted yellow lines. the model was drawn using pymol software .

this close proximity suggests a possible interaction between asp <dig> and arg <dig>  the structure-based alignment of the primary sequence of csnn <dig> with the other members of gh <dig> family revealed that the arginine residue at position  <dig> is conserved in all the chitosanases biochemically characterized
 <cit>  strongly suggesting that this arginine plays an important role in catalysis
 <cit> . this arginine is listed in the molecular signature of glycoside hydrolase families  <dig> and 80
 <cit>  in the prosite database
 <cit> .

chitosanase assays of arg42-mutated chitosanases from proteins extracts from e. coli cells
to assess the impact of arg <dig> mutations on the catalytic activity of csnn <dig>  this residue was substituted by all the  <dig> other amino acids found in proteins. all mutated genes were expressed in e. coli cells using induction with  <dig> mm iptg. chitosanase activities were assayed directly from whole cell crude protein extracts. these preliminary results showed that any mutation in arg <dig> resulted in a considerable loss of enzymatic activity .

specific activities and kinetic analysis of purified arg42-mutated chitosanases toward chitosan
to better understand the implication of arg <dig> in the catalytic mechanism of chitosanase, we first purified two mutated chitosanases, r42e and r42k, in which the strongly basic arg <dig> residue was replaced by acidic  or less basic  residue, respectively. specific activities obtained for these enzymes are listed in table 
 <dig> 

* data from ref.
 <cit> .

substitutions of arg <dig> by glu or lys severely affected the catalytic activity. as shown in table 
 <dig>  r42e and r42k mutants retained, respectively,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of wild type specific activity. the drastic loss of activity when arg <dig> is mutated not only to an acidic residue , but also into a basic one , strongly suggests that arg <dig> might be essential to maintain csnn <dig> catalytic activity.

in our previous work, we have shown that the d40g mutant retains significant enzymatic activity  despite the lack of the general base residue
 <cit> . because of the possible interaction between asp <dig> and arg <dig>  we also purified two double mutated chitosanases in which the d40g mutation was accompanied by a mutation of arg <dig> into glu  or lys .

the two double mutants d40g+r42e and d40g+r42k retained, respectively, only  <dig> % and 1% of the d40g mutant activity  . these data show that arg <dig> is essential for catalytic activity even in the chitosanase whose active center has been reconfigured by the d40g mutation. the severe loss of catalytic activity in both the wild type and d40g configuration of csnn <dig> suggests that the role of arg <dig> might arise not only from its interaction with asp <dig>  thus, arg <dig> must also accomplish another role in csnn <dig> than that of interacting with asp <dig>  because of the severe loss of activity caused by arg <dig> substitution in the d40g context, d40g+r42e and d40g+r42k mutants were not further investigated.

we determined optimum ph for chitosanase activity of r42e and r42k mutants. however, optimum ph values of both mutants did not differ from the optimum ph  <dig>  value for wild-type chitosanase .

because substrate inhibition was previously observed for csnn <dig> and other chitosanases not only for high molecular weight chitosan
 <cit>  but also for glucosamine oligosaccharides
 <cit> , kinetic parameters were obtained for wild-type and mutant chitosanases and interpreted according to the substrate inhibition model .

analysis of kinetic parameters obtained for the arg <dig> mutants revealed that the turnover rates of r42e and r42k, as reflected in their kcat values, were, respectively, 1/ <dig> and 1/ <dig> of the wild type chitosanase. both mutants also had higher km values than the wild type chitosanase . thus, the substitution of arg <dig> had an important effect on the substrate-binding mode of chitosanase. the combination of the decrease in kcat and the increase in km, resulted in decreases of overall catalytic efficiency  of r42e and r42k respectively of 111-fold and 91-fold as compared to the wild type, which is consistent with the specific activities observed for these mutants. as mentioned above, kinetics of the hydrolysis of chitosan of csnn <dig> wild type and both arg <dig> mutants did not exhibit the classical michaelis-menten fitting curve, but rather followed a model assuming that substrate inhibition influenced the rate of chitosanase–catalyzed reaction. non-linear regression curve fitting yielded a ki value of  <dig> μg/ml for wt csnn <dig>  a substrate concentration 59-fold greater than the km value. in the case of r42e and r42k mutants, the ki values were, respectively, of  <dig> μg/ml and  <dig> μg/ml which are 6-fold lower for r42e and  <dig> -fold lower for r42k than that of wild type. these data showed that substrate inhibition was relatively low for wild type csnn <dig>  being only observed at substrate concentrations well above the km value, whereas arg42-mutated chitosanases were rapidly inhibited as substrate concentration was increased. furthermore, the ki value was even below the km value  when arg <dig> was substituted by the strongly acidic residue, glutamate. both mutated chitosanases were inhibited by increasing substrate concentrations to a greater extent than the wild type chitosanase.

overall, kinetic analysis showed that r <dig> mutants were impaired in their catalytic activity as well as in their interaction with substrate.

thermal unfolding of the arg42-mutated chitosanases
as reflected by the changes in km values, the substitution of arg <dig> by glutamate or lysine seemed to affect the enzyme affinity to the substrate. hence, the oligosaccharide binding ability of the arg <dig> mutant chitosanases was evaluated by thermal unfolding experiments. the thermal stability of chitosanases in absence or presence of  <dig> was assessed by monitoring cd at  <dig> nm . in the presence of  <dig>  the transition temperatures  values of r42e and r42k mutant chitosanases increased by  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c, respectively . these tm elevations upon the addition of  <dig> were highly comparable to that of  <dig> °c observed for the wild type enzyme
 <cit> . therefore,  <dig> binding enhanced the protein stability of both arg- <dig> mutants in a similar extent to that observed for the wild type chitosanase.

as previously reported by roy et al.  <cit> , fluorometric determination of tm in presence of chitosan can provide additional information about the mechanism by which mutations can influence chitosanase thermal stability. thus, chitosan binding ability of the arg <dig> mutant chitosanases was also assessed by monitoring intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence . an essential condition for using enzyme-substrate fluorometric experiments is that assays must be done under non-limiting condition with respect to substrate concentration
 <cit> . as a consequence, chitosan concentration of  <dig> μg/ml was used in order to avoid substrate depletion under the experimental conditions. the tm values of chitosanases in the presence or absence of two chitosan samples differing by their degrees of deacetylation  were determined as listed in table 
 <dig>  in the absence of chitosan, tm of the r42k mutant was only slightly lower than that of wild type chitosanase. the replacement of arg <dig> by a lysine did not affect significantly the thermal stability of this mutant. the substitution of arg <dig> by a glutamate resulted in a greater decrease of tm . possibly, the replacement of arg <dig> by a glutamate disrupted some inter-residue interactions resulting in a decrease of thermal stability. more significantly, the tm elevations due to contact with 84%-deacetylated chitosan were, respectively, almost 4-fold and 3-fold higher for mutated enzymes than that observed for wild type chitosanase. the tm elevations upon the addition of chitosan were even higher for the mutated enzymes when tested with 99%-deacetylated chitosan , while the wild type chitosanase did not show further tm elevation when put in the presence of this highly deacetylated substrate. globally, chitosan binding elevated the tms of both mutants to a much greater extent than that observed for the wild type chitosanase, suggesting that the mutation of the arg <dig> residue significantly affected the binding mode of chitosan substrate to chitosanase.

effect of the degree of n-deacetylation of chitosan on the activity of arg42-mutated chitosanases
we also investigated the activity of the various chitosanases with respect to the degree of n-deacetylation of their substrates . the relative initial activities  are shown on figure 
 <dig>  for wild-type chitosanase, a clear preference was observed for substrates with high degrees of n-deacetylation. however, a different pattern was observed for arg42-mutated chitosanases: the chitosan with 86% dda was the best substrate for r42k and r42e mutants  while activities slightly decreased against highly n-deacetylated chitosans. moreover, the arg <dig> mutant enzymes remained relatively more active than wild-type chitosanase against less n-deacetylated chitosans . as a result, wild-type chitosanase was 9-fold more active on 97% n-deacetylated chitosan than on 62% n-deacetylated chitosan while r42k and r42e mutants were only 2-fold more active on the latter . thus, mutations of r <dig> residue had a pronounced effect on substrate preference of chitosanase.

analysis of  <dig> hydrolysis by the arg42-mutated chitosanases
to further understand the interaction of the arg <dig> mutant enzymes with the substrate, the mode of hydrolysis of  <dig> was also investigated. the reaction time-courses of  <dig> hydrolysis by r42e and r42k mutant enzymes were monitored by real-time ms
 <cit>  and the profiles of product production were analyzed. the specific activities of the mutant chitosanases were determined from the degradation rate of  <dig>  and were found to be  <dig> min- <dig> for r42e and  <dig> min- <dig> for r42k, which corresponded to ~5% and ~10% of the wild-type specific activity  – values which are consistent with those measured with high molecular weight chitosan.

as shown in figure 
 <dig>  the overall product distributions of the arg- <dig> mutants were not changed when compared to that of wild-type . nevertheless, closer examination of the product distribution during the reaction showed that the cleavage preferences of r42e and r42k mutant chitosanases differ from that of wild type .
7

calculations are shown for the reaction stage at 50% substrate depletion , but the observed trends were present during the reaction time-course from 20% up to 80% of substrate depletion as well . first, the frequencies of symmetrical cleavage of hexamers into trimers were enhanced for the two arg <dig> mutants in comparison to the wild-type enzyme. the increase of trimeric product formation in mutant-catalyzed hydrolysis was counterbalanced by a reduction of the asymmetric cleavage of  <dig> into  <dig> +  <dig>  furthermore, the efficiency of the arg <dig> mutant chitosanases to use  <dig> as a substrate was greatly improved compared to that of the wild-type. when the cleavage frequency of  <dig> into  <dig> was calculated at the stage of 50% substrate hydrolysis, the cleavage frequency was of  <dig>  for r42e and  <dig>  for r42k . overall, both arg <dig> mutants seemed to favor symmetrical cleavage of hexasaccharide or tetrasaccharide at the expense of asymmetrical cleavage. mutations of arg <dig> altered the pattern of hydrolysis, suggesting again some role in interaction with the substrate.

discussion
site-directed mutagenesis
 <cit>  is now used universally to identify essential amino acids for enzymatic catalysis. this technique revealed however an extremely complex picture of the enzyme mechanisms. indeed, today we know that some residues other than the catalytic amino acids play an essential role in maintaining the integrity of the enzymatic function. the case of glycoside hydrolases does not make an exception: in the past few years, several studies showed that, apart from the carboxylic catalytic residues, other residues are crucial for catalysis
 <cit> . in streptomyces sp. n <dig> chitosanase, some key residues have been identified and are believed to modulate the pka of catalytic residues
 <cit> , to orient the nucleophilic water molecule in an appropriate way to attack the glycosidic bond
 <cit> , to stabilize the protein structure
 <cit>  and to participate in the substrate-enzyme interactions
 <cit> . in this study, we demonstrated that the arginine  <dig> is important for the enzymatic function of csnn <dig>  moreover, we showed that this arginine plays a dual role by influencing not only the catalytic nucleophile residue asp <dig> but also by modulating the substrate binding mode.

the substitution of arg <dig> by any other amino acid resulted in an important decrease of specific activity . the effect of replacement of this arginine was quite obvious in r42e and r42k as reflected by their severe loss of specific activity. this loss of activity can be partly explained by the drastic decreases of the kcat values observed for these mutants . arg <dig> might be involved in creating the suitable electrostatic environment required for asp <dig> to achieve its catalytic function. examination of the protein structure with the what if program
 <cit>  showed that arg <dig> and asp <dig> are close enough to possibly interact through electrostatic type of interaction . in the case of the bacillus circulans xylanase , it has been shown that the presence of a positive charge of an arginine in the vicinity of the catalytic nucleophile glutamate resulted in lowering the pka of the latter, consequently helping it to maintain a negatively charged state
 <cit> . substitution of the arginine by a lysine in this xylanase had only a slight effect on enzyme activity, while its substitution by a non-charged side chain residue  resulted in a dramatic loss of activity. in our case, both substitutions by lysine or glutamate resulted in severe loss of activity.

the role of the equivalent residue arg <dig> in the chitosanase from bacillus circulans mh-k <dig> has been investigated
 <cit> . mutations of this residue into alanine or glutamine resulted in abolition of the enzymatic activity. the authors concluded that this residue deprotonates the catalytic nucleophile asp <dig> , a suggestion compatible with the participation of this arginine in an electrostatic interaction with the catalytic nucleophile.

however, our data suggest that arg <dig> could have another function in the enzyme mechanism. the enhanced km values of arg <dig> mutants indicate that they might be impaired in their substrate binding mode . the fact that hydrolysis of chitosan by r42e and r42k chitosanases was markedly more affected by substrate inhibition than the wild type chitosanase, as reflected by the ki values , is also in agreement with this hypothesis. analysis of the reaction time-courses of  <dig> degradation by r42e and r42k mutants chitosanases showed that their cleavage patterns were significantly different from the wild-type enzyme. both mutants favored symmetrical cleavage  <dig> +  <dig> at the expense of the asymmetrical one generating  <dig> +  <dig>  furthermore, the relative frequency of  <dig> cleavage into  <dig> +  <dig> was enhanced compared with wild-type . implication of arg <dig> in substrate binding was also reflected by tm elevations upon the addition of chitosan , much higher in mutants than for wild type enzyme; an effect further amplified by the high degree of n-deacetylation. however, implication of arg <dig> in substrate binding was not reflected by tm elevations upon the addition of  <dig>  an oligosaccharide which is not further hydrolyzed by the enzyme . because the substrate binding cleft of chitosanase is described by a symmetrical model including six subsites  with cleavage occurring in the middle
 <cit> , trisaccharide binding must occur completely either on a side, or other of the cleavage site
 <cit> . therefore arg <dig> residue seems to influence the productive binding of substrate but not the non-productive binding as exemplified by interaction with  <dig> 

these observations correlate well with the change in profile of activity against chitosans with various degrees of n-deacetylation  resulting from mutation of arg <dig>  the effect of the degree of n-deacetylation of chitosan on chitosanase initial specific activity has been reported by several teams. the gh <dig> chitosanase from bukholderia gladioli chb <dig> hydrolysed chitosan of 70% degree of deacetylation to a higher extent than completely deacetylated chitosan
 <cit> . another gh <dig> family member, the chitosanase from streptomyces coelicolor a <dig>  was found to be more active against fully deacetylated chitosan
 <cit> . several chitosanases from gh <dig> family such as chitosanase from bacillus cereus d-11
 <cit>  and from bacillus sp. p <dig> j
 <cit>  were most active against chitosans in the 80% to 90% n-deacetylation range. on the other hand, the gh <dig> chitosanase from paenibacillus sp.  <dig> was able to hydrolyse chitosans within a wide range of degrees of n-deacetylation  with similar efficiency
 <cit> . so far, it was then assumed in the literature that each enzyme has its own pattern of preference against the degree of n-deacetylation. we showed, for the first time, that this pattern can be modified by mutating a single residue. considering the importance that the negatively charged carboxylic residues have in chitosan recognition by the chitosanases, we suggest than one important function of arg <dig> is to optimize the electrostatic interaction between the charged residues of the substrate binding cleft and the amino-groups of glcn residues in chitosan . mutation of arg <dig> disrupted this charge equilibrium, and, as a consequence, an altered interaction between enzyme and substrate was observed, resulting in decreased activity , enhanced substrate inhibition and different positioning of oligosaccharide substrates. the substrate inhibition may also suggest the access of more than one molecule of substrate, which leads to binding of a second substrate molecule to the active site, forming a nonproductive substrate-enzyme-substrate complex
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we demonstrated that the residue arg <dig>  highly conserved in gh <dig> family, substantially contributes to the enzymatic function of the streptomyces sp. n <dig> chitosanase. the assignment of a specific function to arg <dig> could arise from the determination of the structure of the enzyme-substrate complex. however, the predictions based on the structure of the free enzyme are of limited value for gh <dig> chitosanases, as the available experimental data suggest that the enzyme belonging to this family must undergo substantial conformational change while binding the substrate, narrowing the catalytic cleft in order to achieve catalysis
 <cit> . in the context of an enzyme-substrate complex structure, interaction between arg <dig> and thr <dig>  could also be expected. nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments are progress and will hopefully give rise to new information on the enzyme-substrate complex structure
