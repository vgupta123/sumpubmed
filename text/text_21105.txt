BACKGROUND
periconceptional environment, especially during oocyte maturation and preimplantation development, can influence the pattern of later gestation leading to permanent changes in offspring growth, physiology, health and disease risk through to adulthood  <cit> . factors such as the quality and composition of maternal or paternal diet, parental metabolism and health, or specific conditions as used in assisted conception such as embryo culture, can all influence the developmental programme. this sensitive window in the lifecycle around conception can be viewed within the broader context of the developmental origins of health and disease  concept. this proposes that risk of adult onset diseases may derive from in utero conditions where nutrient availability may control fetal growth and metabolic homeostasis but which may predispose to adult disease, particularly cardiovascular dysfunction and metabolic syndrome, if homeostatic changes do not match postnatal environment. epidemiological studies on human populations and various animal models show support for the dohad concept  <cit> .

we have used a rodent maternal low protein diet model to study mechanisms of periconceptional programming whereby protein restriction is applied exclusively during the period from mating to blastocyst formation  with normal nutrition  provided for the remainder of gestation, and standard chow diet postnatally. this brief nutritional challenge is sufficient to induce cardiometabolic dysfunction, hypertension and abnormal behaviour in adulthood  <cit> . emb-lpd changes the pattern of development by altering the composition of the uterine fluid which is detected by blastocysts via mtor signalling  <cit> . the embryo responds to the nutrient challenge by activating several compensatory processes within extra-embryonic lineages which collectively act to increase nutrient provision from the mother for the remainder of gestation to protect fetal growth. these responses include increased endocytosis and proliferation within the trophectoderm lineage  and increased motility and invasiveness of outgrowing trophoblast at the time of implantation  <cit> . lpd treatment maintained throughout gestation leads to increased nutrient transport efficiency in the mid- and late-gestation placenta  <cit> . stimulated endocytosis is also seen in response to emb-lpd in the primitive endoderm  extra-embryonic lineage formed from the blastocyst inner cell mass ; this response is maintained until late gestation within the derivative visceral endoderm of the yolk sac placenta to promote nutrient uptake from the uterine milieu  <cit> . nutrient provision and growth promotion resulting from these extra-embryonic adaptations to poor maternal diet, whilst likely favouring competitive fitness of offspring during periods of limited food supply, also lead to later chronic disease when the diet improves, evidenced by the resulting perinatal weight correlating with adult cv and behavioural dysfunction  <cit> .

since extra-embryonic responses to emb-lpd persist from early development throughout gestation and have important consequences for protecting conceptus growth and affecting adult disease risk, we anticipate conserved epigenetic mechanisms may be driving these physiological processes. moreover, the compensatory changes persist well beyond the period of dietary challenge and reflect a ‘memory’ of an earlier environment. periconceptional induction of epigenetic change has been demonstrated in other models of programming, such as following in vitro culture treatment of pre-implantation embryos  <cit> . however, clear evidence of epigenetic modifications driving physiological responses within an in vivo periconceptional programming model has not been forthcoming previously.

here, we investigate the epigenetic status of histone modifications occurring within the pe lineage in response to emb-lpd for evidence of the programming of altered phenotype. we have used embryoid bodies  derived from embryonic stem  cell lines generated from emb-lpd and npd blastocysts since the pe-like layer on the surface of emb-lpd ebs exhibit the enhanced endocytosis compensatory phenotype after at least six passages in standard culture  <cit> .

effect of maternal diet on embryoid body gata factor expression
the pe lineage is regulated through gata <dig> and gata <dig> transcription factors that activate pe specification and differentiation through several downstream target genes  <cit> . we investigated the expression of gata <dig> and gata <dig> and the downstream target gene, dab <dig> in emb-lpd and npd ebs. gata <dig> gene expression was significantly reduced in emb-lpd ebs while gata <dig> was reduced but only to trend level and dab <dig> expression was unaffected by maternal dietary origin . reduced protein expression of gata <dig> but not dab <dig> was also evident in emb-lpd ebs . the authenticity of the changed gata <dig> expression in emb-lpd ebs was supported by ex vivo analysis of mouse e <dig> visceral yolk sac tissue also showing reduced gata <dig> protein expression compared with npd control .figure  <dig>

effect of maternal diet on gata <dig> promoter histone acetylation in embryoid bodies
histone modifications have been shown to regulate gata <dig> and gata <dig> gene expression in other models  <cit> . we used chip assay to examine three upstream regions of the gata <dig> and gata <dig> genes  in ebs to compare levels of histone modifications within promoter domains with respect to maternal diet. a panel of antibodies was used to probe histone acetylation and methylation with targets for acetylated h <dig> and h <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k9me <dig> and h3k27me <dig>  our analysis revealed a distinct pattern of modifications dependent upon dietary origin of ebs. the gata <dig> promoter at g6p <dig> site in emb-lpd ebs exhibited significant hypoacetylation of both h <dig> and h <dig> and a trend of decrease in the density of the histone marker h3k4me <dig> compared with npd ebs . in addition to these three histone modification changes known to be associated with reduced gene expression  <cit> , the g6p <dig> gata <dig> promoter site in emb-lpd ebs had reduced enrichment of rna polymerase ii , further supporting a suppressed state of expression. no significant changes in other histone modifications, including h3k4me <dig>  h3k9me <dig> and h3k27me <dig>  were detected. the gata <dig> promoter site at g4p <dig> showed a pattern of histone modifications in emb-lpd ebs similar to those in the gata <dig> promoter but not to the level of significance except that h3k9me <dig> was significantly reduced compared with npd ebs . at other sites upstream of the gata <dig> and gata <dig> promoter domains , maternal diet had little or no effects on histone modifications ; however, h3k4me <dig> on g4p <dig> showed a significant increase in emb-lpd ebs . we used gapdh as a control house-keeping gene in our chip analysis and found no difference in histone modifications on its promoter in ebs with respect to maternal diet .figure  <dig>

effect of maternal diet on expression of histone deacetylases in embryoid bodies
given the pattern of histone hypoacetylation detected at the gata <dig> promoter coinciding with reduced expression of this gene in emb-lpd ebs, we evaluated whether the expression of histone deacetylases  was altered in response to maternal diet. hdacs are expressed in early embryos and have been shown to modify their expression in response to in vitro culture  <cit> . we found hdac- <dig> gene expression but not hdac- <dig> was upregulated in emb-lpd ebs .figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study we have investigated the molecular mechanisms of developmental programming of the pe extra-embryonic lineage within our emb-lpd mouse model associated with adult-onset disease. the emb-lpd pe shows enhanced endocytosis at ligand, lysosomal and receptor levels, a cellular modification that is sustained through to late gestation in the yolk sac visceral endoderm to support increased nutrient uptake despite poor maternal nutrition, thereby likely to protect fetal development  <cit> . significantly, these changes are maintained after induction even if maternal diet is returned to control levels, a characteristic we have demonstrated also occurs in the trophectoderm  extra-embryonic lineage  <cit>  and is suggestive of epigenetic mechanisms, the focus of the current study. we chose to investigate potential pe epigenetic mechanisms using ebs since they maintain the enhanced endocytosis cellular phenotype induced by nutritional programming previously revealed from ex vivo tissues  <cit>  and, in the current study, show similar downregulation of gata <dig> as seen in ex vivo vys, thereby confirming their authenticity. also, the pe-like layer formed on ebs from undifferentiated es cells is representative of the pe layer formed in the late blastocyst from the icm, and pe-like cells in ebs as well as the core primitive ectoderm have been used extensively as a model for early cell lineage derivation in post-implantation development over many years  <cit> .

our results show significant change in gene expression and histone modifications in emb-lpd ebs in comparison with npd ebs. emb-lpd ebs express reduced levels of gata <dig> transcription factor, a key regulator of pe differentiation  <cit> , consistent with gata <dig> downregulation found in vivo within the emb-lpd vys. reduced gata <dig> expression coincided with histone h <dig> and h <dig> hypoacetylation and reduced recruitment of rna polymerase ii at the gata <dig> promoter in emb-lpd ebs, all factors consistent with reduced gene expression  <cit> . moreover, the expression of hdac- <dig> but not hdac- <dig> was increased in emb-lpd ebs. these hdacs are known to be expressed in early embryos and are sensitive to culture conditions so represent good candidates for coordinating histone epigenetic programming  <cit> . collectively, these data reveal for the first time a persistent change in eb epigenetic status mediated through maternal diet and provide new clues to the origin of developmental programming mechanisms in this model. they also demonstrate that es cells and derivative ebs maintain altered gene expression in vitro, long after the inductive dietary challenge, and provide a useful tool for analysis of underlying mechanisms, reducing the requirement for experimental animals.

the finding that emb-lpd ebs, and ex vivo vys, exhibit reduced gata <dig> expression, apparently regulated through histone hypoacetylation in the ebs, may explain the increased size of emb-lpd ebs. gata <dig> and gata <dig> are zinc-finger transcription factors that perform multiple roles both during development in the determination of cell lineages and in adult tissues in maintaining cell differentiation states  <cit> . loss of gata factor expression has been implicated in several forms of cancer and in ovarian cancer models where loss of gata <dig> and gata <dig> expression coincides with gata <dig> and gata <dig> promoter histone hypoacetylation in response to hdac activity coupled with growth promotion and malignancy  <cit>  indicating a similarity in epigenetic and cellular mechanisms to the current study.

whilst emb-lpd ebs had downregulated gata <dig> expression, gata <dig> expression was not significantly affected. in es cells, absence of gata <dig> gene leads to loss of gata <dig> expression whilst absence of gata <dig> gene does not inhibit gata <dig> expression, indicating a hierarchical relationship  <cit> . however, functional redundancy exists between gata <dig> and gata <dig> expression in other models including pancreatic and ovarian germ cell differentiation and in ebs during myocyte differentiation with gata <dig> expression not dependent upon gata <dig> expression  <cit> . thus, the distinction between gata <dig> and gata <dig> expression in the current study may be explained either by functional redundancy or by gata <dig> expression, although reduced, being above the threshold required for gata <dig> expression.

the emb-lpd ebs also showed expression of the gata <dig> downstream target gene, dab <dig>  required for epithelial function especially in receptor-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . dab <dig> acts as a cargo-selective adaptor protein facilitating apical localisation of the megalin receptor  and clathrin-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . the endocytic function in emb-lpd ebs is stimulated together with increased expression of megalin as a compensatory response to maternal diet  <cit>  and dab <dig> expression and function is likely protected in the eb model to achieve this. dab <dig> expression may be maintained either by a gata4-dependent pathway  <cit> , by gata <dig> being above the threshold required for dab <dig> promoter activation or by an alternative mechanism. we anticipate that the growth stimulation coinciding with reduced expression of gata <dig> but not dab <dig> in emb-lpd ebs will be partly driven by the increased nutrient delivery provided by enhanced endocytosis. the resulting increase in growth in emb-lpd ebs may extend to both surface pe-like layer and core epiblast cells and, like other compensatory response mechanisms, may reflect in vivo processes that safeguard fetal development against dietary deficiency. indeed, the increased endocytic activity observed within the mature vys in late gestation may be dependent upon this initial growth stimulation.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that maternal diet regulates the epigenetic status of the early embryo, reducing expression of the pe lineage regulator, gata <dig> transcription factor, in ebs. reduced gata <dig> gene expression coincides with histone hypoacetylation and loss of rna polymerase binding of the gata <dig> promoter, and stimulation of hdac- <dig> expression. these changes are associated with increased growth of the emb-lpd eb which may contribute, alongside stimulation in endocytosis, as compensatory responses to support maintenance of nutrient delivery.
