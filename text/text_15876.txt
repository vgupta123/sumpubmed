BACKGROUND
embryonic stem cells  are pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell mass of the mammalian blastocyst with self-renewal capacity and multi-developmental plasticity, which makes escs a powerful tool for cell-based therapy  <cit> . several lines of evidence confirmed that under appropriate conditions, escs could be induced to differentiate into pancreatic beta-cells, liver cells, myocardial cells, hematopoietic cells, and neural stem cells  <cit> . however, these strategies generally produced the desired cells only within heterogeneous cell populations, including pluripotent stem cells and undesired esc derivatives. the transplantation of the cell population into tissues is inevitably associated with formation of teratomas, impeding the application of esc-based therapies in clinic  <cit> . recent studies revealed that the formation of teratomas was not observed after transplanting purified progenitor cells derived from escs  <cit> . these findings indicated that differentiating and purifying esc-derived cells in vitro could be a strategy that renders escs safe and effective in clinic.

it has been reported that mouse escs had the potential to differentiate into a gut-like structure and neural cells in vitro  <cit> . musashi <dig> , expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells, is an important marker for intestinal epithelial stem cells  and neural stem cells   <cit> . in our recent study, we had found that msi <dig> and hairy and enhancer of split  <dig>  high-expression cells  derived from mouse escs could develop into small intestinal epithelial cells, which enhanced the repair of small intestinal injury in vivo  <cit> . furthermore, to purify the msi1-positive cell, we constructed a gfp reporter plasmid vector driven by msi1-specific promoter   <cit> . although the pmsi1-gfp vector can be used to mark msi1-positive cells from a cell population, the isolation process is quite complicated and depends on a cell transfection technique, which restricts its application. therefore, a more convenient and practical separation strategy should be established for the further investigation of msi1-positive cells.

side population  analysis, a widely used flow cytometry assay, based on the ability of cells to efflux fluorescent dna-binding dye hoechst  <dig>  can identify stem cells in tissues, and is a method which opens up the potential to further enrich stem cells within heterogeneous populations  <cit> . sp was first identified and sorted from bone marrow by fluorescence activated cell sorter  as a distinct cell population highly enriched for hematopoietic stem cells and endowed with long-term repopulating capacity  <cit> . since this discovery, an increasing number of studies have shown that an analogous sp fraction has been identified in a variety of tissues with high levels of stem-like gene expression and multipotent differentiation potential  <cit> . the use of sp analysis was also described to isolate a putative stem cell population from mouse small intestine, and msi <dig> was highly expressed in the sp fraction  <cit> . this suggested that sp sorting could be an effective method to enrich for progenitor cells, especially in the absence of definitive cell-surface marker.

in this study, our objective was to establish a practical process to enrich for the msi <dig> positive cells from msi <dig> high-expression cell  population derived from mouse escs in vitro.

RESULTS
differentiation of msi1high cells in vitro
escs were cultured by the hanging-drop method in eb medium to attain ebs in vitro. on the fifth day of ebs formation, the dissociated eb cells were adhesively cultured in egf medium to induce the differentiation of msi1high cells.

real-time quantitative rt-pcr analysis suggested that msi <dig> was expressed at a low level in escs and in 5-day ebs . during the induction stage of msi1high cells, the mrna expression of msi <dig> showed an increasing trend. in the 5-day induction stage under egf administration, msi <dig> mrna was  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold greater compared with escs, and was significantly higher than that in the other two control groups .

immunocytochemistry results revealed that a portion of cells in 5-day induction stage were immunostained for msi <dig> . in the egf group, the positive cells  were mainly detected in the middle of cell clones. the percentages of msi1+ cells in egf, sf, and fcs groups were  <dig> % ±  <dig> %,  <dig> % ±  <dig> %, and  <dig> % ±  <dig> %, respectively . the percentage of msi1+ cells in the egf group was significantly higher than that in two control groups . these results indicated that 5-day administration of egf  could induce the differentiation of msi1high cells in vitro.

sp and nsp portions can be detected in induction stage population
to enrich for the msi <dig> positive cells, the msi1high cells were stained with hoechst  <dig>  subsequently, the sp fraction was investigated by facs. the results revealed that a portion of the cells in the msi1high cell population and control groups were stained weakly . subsequently, prepared cells were analyzed by facs and the typical results of dual-wavelength facs of viable cells based on the hoechst fluorescence are shown in figure 2b. as can be seen in figure 2b , a distinct sp and nsp were presented in cells from all three groups. the percentage of sp in the induction stage cells after  <dig> days of culture was  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for egf ,  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for fs, and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for fcs medium . based on statistical analysis, the sp percentage in msi1high cells was significantly higher than that in sf  and fcs control groups . although the average percentage of sp in sf group was somewhat higher than that of fcs cell population, there was no statistically difference between them .

previous reports describing sp fractions from liver, mammary gland, and lung have revealed that the sp phenotype is dependent on efflux of hoechst  <dig> by multidrug resistance-like pumps, such as abcg2/bcrp <dig>  <cit> . to investigate whether or not the sp from differentiated populations derived from escs was caused by analogous efflux of hoechst  <dig>  we treated the detected cell preparations with  <dig> μm verapamil to inhibit members of the multi-drug resistance family. this treatment resulted in a  <dig> % ±  <dig> % reduction of cells sorting to sp position in egf group , and the reduction percentage in sf and fcs control groups were  <dig> % ±  <dig> % and  <dig> % ±  <dig> %, respectively . the percentage of sp reduced by verapamil administration in msi1high cells was significantly higher than that of other two control groups .

msi <dig> positive cells can be enriched in sp fraction from msi1high cell population
to explore the hypothesis that msi <dig> positive cells can be enriched in sp fraction from msi1high cells, the sp and nsp cells were synchronously isolated from msi1high cell population under a condition without verapamil .

subsequently, as a gene marker for iescs and nscs, the expression of msi <dig> was respectively detected in sp and nsp fractions on mrna and protein levels. the results of quantitative rt-pcr revealed that the relative msi <dig> mrna abundance in sp and nsp was  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold and  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold greater compared with unsorted msi1high cells . western blot analysis was used to compare band intensities of msi <dig> with β-actin as a constitutive marker. msi <dig> protein was detected in sp and nsp fractions . integrated intensity of msi <dig> protein in sp fraction was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and the msi <dig> expression band was not detected in nsp fraction . the expression of msi <dig> in sp fraction was significantly higher than that in nsp fraction and unsorted msi1high cells . taken together these results indicated that sorting sp fraction by facs could be a valuable method to isolate msi1+ cells.

expressions of other marker genes for iescs and nscs
the expressions of other marker genes for iescs  and nscs  in sp and nsp fractions were further investigated  <cit> . the results of quantitative rt-pcr revealed that the relative mrna abundance compared with unsorted msi1high cells in sp and nsp fractions were  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold and  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold greater for lgr <dig> ;  <dig>  ±  <dig>  folds and  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold for hes <dig> ;  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold and  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold greater for bmi <dig> ;  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold and  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold greater for ascl <dig> ;  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold and  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold greater for sox <dig> ; and  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold and  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold greater for nestin . the expressions of lgr <dig>  hes <dig>  bmi <dig>  and nestin in sp fraction were significantly higher than those in nsp fraction and unsorted msi1high cells .

abcg <dig> expression in sp and nsp fractions from msi1high cells
subsequently, total rna was extracted from sp, nsp, and unsorted msi1high cells, and analyzed by rt-pcr for abcg <dig> . the relative abundance of abcg <dig> mrna expression was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in msi1high cells,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in sp group, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in nsp group . there was no statistical difference among these three groups in abcg <dig> expression. these results indicated that a similar expression of abcg <dig>  a multidrug resistance-like pump, was detected in sp and nsp fractions sorted from msi1high cells.

sp from msi1high cells can develop into intestinal epithelial and neural tissues in vivo
the sp and nsp cells sorted from msi1high cells cultured in a dmem medium supplemented with 15% fcs. the proliferation of sp and nsp cells in vitro were observed and assessed by proliferative curve . the results showed that sp and nsp cells were adhesively cultured and presented with similar proliferative profiles in vitro. to further determine that the sorting sp fraction by facs was an available method to enrich for msi <dig> positive cells in vitro, sp and nsp cells sorted from msi1high cells were hypodermically engrafted into the backs of nod/scid mice. two weeks after injection, grafts were developed with a diameter of  <dig> to  <dig>  cm.

the grafts developed from sp and nsp both contained a mixture of well-differentiated tissues and many immature cells without specific structure. abundant adenoid , neural tube-like , and sack-like structures were observed in the grafts from sp cells . fibrous tissues, macroscopic cartilages, nest-like structures, and pigment epithelium were observed in nsp grafts .

because msi <dig> is regarded as a marker for iescs and nscs, the development of intestinal epithelial and neural cells in sp grafts were investigated  <cit> . the mrna expressions of neural tissue markers  and intestinal epithelial cells markers  were detected in grafts from sp and nsp cells by rt-pcr . the results revealed that the mrna relative abundance was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for nestin,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for tubulin β iii,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for si,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for fabp <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  for tff <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  for lyz <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for chga in sp grafts . the mrna abundance in nsp grafts was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for lyz <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for chga . the expressions of nestin, tubulin β iii, si, fabp <dig>  and tff <dig> were not detected in nsp grafts. the statistical analysis revealed that the mrna expressions of nestin, tubulin β iii, si, fabp <dig>  tff <dig>  and lyz <dig> in sp grafts were significantly higher than that in nsp grafts . these data indicated that more neural tissues and small intestinal epithelial cells were developed in the grafts from sp cells.

to further characterize the developed potential of sp cells from msi1high cells, grafts were immunohistochemically stained with tubulin β iii and fabp <dig> to detect the differentiation of neural and small intestinal epithelial tissues in vivo. the results showed that the tubulin β iii positive cells were located in some of nonspecific structures and nest-like structures . more tubulin β iii-positive cells were detected in the grafts from sp cells than in grafts from nsp cells . fabp <dig> is a marker protein for intestinal absorptive cells. the results revealed that more fabp <dig> positive cells were detected in the grafts from sp cells . partial fabp <dig> positive cells formed sack-like structures. these special structures, mostly constructed of monolayer cells, were similar to the intestinal crypt structure of fetal mice . these results indicated that sp cells sorted from msi1high cells had similar differentiated potentials with msi <dig> positive cells, which could develop into neural and intestinal epithelial tissues in vivo  <cit> .

discussion
the therapeutic potential of esc-derived stem cells has been hindered by the formation of teratomas. purifying esc-derived stem cells is a potential approach to overcome this barrier. sp cells are identified and isolated in many different tissues, tumors, and cell lines, and are generally accepted as a unique character for stem cells  <cit> . the percentages of sp cells derived from escs range from 1% to 16% of total viable cells, depending on the stage of esc development  <cit> . in the current study, sp cells were identified and sorted in the induction stage cells from mouse escs cultured in egf, sf, and fcs medium, and the sp percentage in egf group was significantly higher than that in control groups. consisted with our previous findings showing that egf can induce the differentiation of escs into msi1high cells and increase the percentage of msi <dig> positive cells, 5-day egf administration enhanced the percentage of sp cells , suggesting that the sp fraction probably contains a large proportion of stem or progenitor cells derived from escs, including the msi <dig> positive cells  <cit> .

until recently, it was impossible to isolate iescs and nscs based on identifying any single marker expressed on the cell surface. as a protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus required for asymmetric cell division, msi <dig> is expressed in nscs as well as in iescs  <cit> . in our previous study, the msi1-positive cells sorted from esc-derived cells after a pmsi1-gfp vector transfection had the potential to differentiate into neural and intestinal epithelial cells in vivo  <cit> . however, the isolation process is complicated and completely depends on cell transfection, which restricts its application. it was reported by dekaney et al that the sp fraction sorted from mouse jejunum had the stem-like characters and highly expressed msi <dig>  <cit> . sp cells sorted from colon also expressed msi <dig>  β-integrin, and cd <dig>  consist with these previous studies, our results demonstrated that sp fraction contained almost all msi1-positive cells , indicating that sorting sp fraction by facs, which is regarded as an effective and convenient method to enrich for stem or progenitor cells, could be a reliable method to enrich for msi1-positive cells from the differentiated cell population derived from escs.

zhou et al found that abcg <dig>  a subtype member of the atp binding cassette  transporter, is a molecular determinant of the sp phenotype in mouse bone marrow  <cit> . furthermore, abcg <dig> expression was also identified in sp cells sorted from other tissues, such as skeletal muscle, liver, mammary gland, lung, and skin  <cit> . these studies demonstrated that abcg <dig> plays an important role in the sp phenotype. however, it had become clear that the expression of abcg <dig> was not detected in the all sp cells. the nsp cells sorted from mouse escs expressed bcrp <dig> at a level equivalent to that from the sp fraction  <cit> . it was reported by alt et al that abcg <dig> expression was not detected in the sp cells from human umbilical cord blood  <cit> . this discrepancy was also reported in mammary gland cells and haemopoietic cells  <cit> . in our study, the sp phenotype is partially caused by abcg <dig> activity, as evidenced by the marked reduction in sp cells with the administration of verapamil, an inhibitor of the abcg <dig>  which can block the formation of the sp fraction. the results showed that a similar expression of abcg <dig> between sp and nsp fraction sorted from msi1high cells was detected, indicating that abcg <dig> expression is not sufficient to confer the sp phenotype . because there is a significant overlap in the substrate specificity of abc transporters, with each of the commonly studied family members abcg <dig>  mdr <dig>  and mrp <dig> being capable of effluxing hoechst  <dig> dye, the mechanism contributing to sp phenotype sorted from msilhigh cells should be further investigated  <cit> .

msi <dig>  a marker for nsc and iesc, plays key roles in the maintenance of the stem cell state and its differentiation, which had been shown by several scholars and us  <cit> . the msi <dig> protein can also be found in tissues from patients with endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma, photoreceptor cells, retinal stem cells, and the hair follicle stem cell nich  <cit> . to confirm that the sp cells sorted from msilhigh cells had the phenotype of nsc and iesc, the expressions of other markers for iescs  and nscs  in sp and nsp fractions were detected, respectively   <cit> . the results revealed that sorting sp fraction could enrich for lgr <dig>  hes <dig>  bmi <dig>  and nestin high expression cells, further indicating that sp cells could have the developed potentials of iescs and nscs. recent studies showed that iescs could be grouped into two different phenotypes  <cit> . one group presented with msi <dig> and hes <dig> expression resides in intestinal crypts near the transit-amplifying cells. another marked with lgr <dig> and ascl <dig> resides between paneth cells at the small intestinal crypt base. however, ascl <dig> expression in sp fraction was similar with nsp fraction and not consistent with the expression of lgr <dig> . the reason for the inconsistent expression between lgr <dig> and ascl <dig> is not clear and should be further investigated.

as mentioned above, the strong expression of msi <dig> and other markers for iescs and nscs were detected in sp fraction. sp cells sorted from msi1high cells were engrafted into the nod/scid mice to illuminate their developed profiles compared with nsp cells in vivo. the results showed that the sp grafts tended to differentiate into ad-like, nt-like, and sack-like structures . this pathological profile suggested that sp graft contained more tissues and structures developed from nscs and iescs. consistent with this observation, the expression of neural tissue markers  and intestinal epithelial cells markers  were significantly higher in sp grafts compared with nsp grafts . in addition, immunochemistry showed that more tubulin β iii positive cells partially constructed with a nest-like profile and more fabp2-positive cells were observed in the sp grafts . these results provided strong evidence that sp cells sorted from msi1high cells had the similar potential of msi <dig> positive cells, which could develop into mature neural and intestinal epithelial tissues in vivo. because forming grafts in nod/scid mice is a method for investigating the developed potential of the msi1-positive cells in vivo, we have not yet performed the experiments necessary to prove that the cells isolated from msi1high cells will not form teratomas in the mice with normal immune function.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, sp was identified and isolated from msi1high cell population derived from escs in vitro in this study. furthermore, the sorted sp fraction contains almost all the msi <dig> positive cells and has the potential to differentiate into neural and intestinal epithelial cells in vivo. therefore, sorting sp fraction could be a convenient and effective method to enrich for msi1-positive cells from the differentiated cell population derived from mouse escs.
