BACKGROUND
a class of small non-coding rna  known as microrna   <cit>  can exert multilevel inhibition/repression processes during post-transcriptional or protein synthesis stages  <cit> . mirnas are transcribed in the nucleus into long polyadenylated rnas known as primary -mirnas that contain ~60- <dig> nt secondary hairpin structures termed precursor -mirnas. the rnase iii enzymes rnasen and dgcr <dig> then excise the pre-mirna from the pri-mirna  <cit> . the pre-mirna hairpin is transported into the cytoplasm via the nuclear transport receptor, xpo <dig>  and further processed by another rnase iii enzyme, dicer, into a small rna duplex containing the functional mature mirna and a passenger strand known as mirna star  <cit> . the majority of the mirna star are non-functional and are rapidly degraded, but a small proportion have conserved seed regions, potentially with regulatory roles  <cit> . the mature mirna forms a component of the rna-induced silencing complexes  and guides these complexes to mrna targets via sequence-specific pairing between the mirna seed sequence  and the mrna. typically, mirnas guide the risc complex to the target mrna 3' utr, but incidences where 5' utr and coding-sequences were targeted have been reported  <cit> . in mammals, mirisc normally effects translational repression and, depending on the degree of mirna:mrna sequence complementation, can direct mrna degradation  <cit> . another intriguing regulatory role of mirnas is the silencing of gene transcription which has been observed in plants  <cit> , but has not yet been reported in the mammalian system.

mammalian brain development requires meticulous spatio-temporal regulation of gene/protein expression, from the transcription of dna within the nucleus to translation of mrna in the cytoplasm  <cit> . at embryonic day  <dig>  , the mouse brain undergoes rapid cellular and anatomical changes involving neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex, proliferation of neural progenitor/stem cells at germinative zones, gliogenesis, axonogenesis and rostro-lateral to caudo-medial structure patterning  <cit> . mirnas play crucial roles during brain development and function. mir- <dig>  for example, is localised to the synapto-dendritic compartment of rat hippocampal neurones and has been linked to synaptic development, maturation and plasticity  <cit> . mir- <dig> regulates the patterning activities and neurogenesis at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary in zebrafish  <cit>  and mir- <dig> triggers brain-specific alternative pre-mrna splicing leading to neuronal differentiation in the mouse  <cit> . mirnas are also associated with neurological disorders such as schizophrenia  <cit>  and huntington's disease  <cit> . to date, there are only  <dig> mature mirnas in the mouse genome and  <dig> in the human genome   <cit>  in the mouse and human genomes, respectively. these figures are likely to be a gross underestimate of the actual number of mirnas expressed. most mirnas are short lived, expressed in low abundance and found in specialised cell types during a specific developmental stage, and are therefore likely to remain uncharacterised due to technical limitations or the biological complexity of the tissues and cells of interest.

the emergence of next-generation sequencing technologies based on the massively parallel sequencing  concept has revolutionised the field of genomics and transcriptomics  <cit> . high-throughput generation of sequences from dna or rna has enabled the discovery of rare transcripts, such as alternatively spliced or fusion transcripts, as well as transcripts with low abundance  <cit> . many next-generation sequencing datasets for small rnas have been generated from the adult rodent and human brains  <cit> . however, to date, no small rna profiling of the developing rodent or human brain has been performed using these methods. in this study, we performed deep sequencing of small rnas prepared from an e <dig>  mouse brain. in silico and laboratory based analyses led us to the discovery of  <dig> putative mirnas; mm_br_e15_ <dig>  mm_br_e15_ <dig>  mm_br_e15_ <dig> and mm_br_e15_ <dig>  of these, mm_br_e15_ <dig> is novel and potentially involved in mouse embryogenesis, and brain development and function. this novel mirna has been identified as mir- <dig> 

RESULTS
high-throughput sequencing and annotation of small rna sequences
a total of  <dig> , <dig>  <dig> nt sequence reads were generated from a cdna library constructed from mouse e <dig>  whole brain small rnas. the dataset was deposited into ncbi gene expression omnibus gse <dig> <cit> . clustering of these sequence reads revealed  <dig>  unique tags . screening for adaptor sequences  using a local blastn program showed  <dig>  unique tags  did not have adaptor sequences indicating contamination of larger rna transcripts during library construction . cloning errors resulted in  <dig>  unique tags  consisting of only 5'and 3' adaptor sequences. the remaining  <dig>  unique tags  were considered legitimate as they contained partial adaptor sequences at 5' or 3' or both ends.

of the legitimate unique tags,  <dig>   belonged to the 26- <dig> nt category, whereas  <dig>  unique tags  of 20- <dig> nt were discovered, and therefore formed the majority of the small rnas found in the cdna library . a total of  <dig>  unique tags  were classified into the 16- <dig> nt category and  <dig>  unique tags  of  <dig> nt or shorter were generated from either a pool of very small rnas with unknown function or random rna degradation by-products. the recent identification of tiny rnas  shows that these small rnas are associated with transcription initiation and splice sites specific to metazoans  <cit>  suggesting that these tiny rnas could be functional and represent another level of regulation during gene transcription in the nucleus.

bowtie analyses, allowing only perfect matches, were performed on both the 5' and 3' end of each of the unique tags resulting in  <dig>  tags  not finding a match in the mouse genome. this large proportion of unmatched unique tags included adaptors and low quality tags with errors in sequencing/base-calling. in exceptional circumstances, these unique tags could be derived from intron/exon or exon/exon boundaries, fusion transcripts or uncharacterised genomic regions. these unique tags with their corresponding sequence reads were not included for further analysis. the number of unmatched sequences varies from one study to another. morin and colleagues reported 29-35% of their total sequence reads generated from human embryonic stem cells and embryoid bodies small rna libraries either consisted of errors or were not perfectly matched to the human genome  <cit> . in a different study, deep sequencing of small rna libraries generated from cold-treated and untreated brachypodium monocot plants resulted in only 49-54% of total sequence reads matching perfectly to the genome  <cit> . these studies suggested that a large proportion of the total sequence reads produced by deep sequencing are discarded from further analysis due to the quality of the sequence reads and stringency imposed during sequence alignment.

a total of  <dig>  unique tags  were perfectly matched to the mouse genome. of these,  <dig>   were matched to repetitive elements, and  <dig>   were matched to 'infrastructure' non-coding rnas such as trna, rrna, scrna, snrna or snorna . these unique tags and their corresponding sequence reads were also excluded from further analysis. a total of  <dig>  unique tags  were matched to either mature mirna, mirna star or pre-mirna from mirbase,  <dig>   were matched to refseq,  <dig>   were matched to redundant mouse est sequences,  <dig>   mapped to a single genomic locus and  <dig>   mapped to multiple loci within the genome . intriguingly, a large number of mapped unique tags in unique genomic loci have low abundance and lack association with any known mouse mrnas, ests or mirnas suggesting that these small rnas could be generated from specific type of cells at specific stages of development and therefore have not been characterised to date.

the most abundantly expressed known mirnas
to assess the expression of known mirnas in the developing mouse brain at e <dig> , we analysed all  <dig> mapped mirnas in the dataset. their counts ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  sequence reads or  <dig>  to  <dig>  per  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads . the top 10% of the most abundantly expressed mirnas are presented in table  <dig> . the most abundantly expressed mirna in the e <dig>  developing mouse brain is let-7c- <dig> with its  <dig> family members  having a combined  <dig>  cpm. our finding agrees with the first report by lagos-quintana and colleagues  <cit>  regarding the high representation of let- <dig> family members in the mouse brain, which was also later found in the primate brain  <cit> . despite their high level of expression in the brain, the functional role of let- <dig> in the development of the central nervous system is poorly characterised. however, the expression of let- <dig> has been associated with neural differentiation and lineage specification processes in early brain development  <cit> .

small rna
other mirnas or mirna families that were abundantly expressed in the e <dig>  developing mouse brain include mir- <dig> , which promotes and regulates neuronal differentiation  <cit>  and mir- <dig> , which has a role in the patterning activities and neurogenesis of the central nervous system  <cit> . mir- <dig>  was highly expressed in our dataset and the finding is in agreement with a previous study  <cit> . down-regulation of mir- <dig> expression has been associated with glioblastoma multiforme  <cit>  whereas its up-regulation has been implicated with reduced neuroblastoma cell motility, invasiveness and cell growth  <cit> . in addition, both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are highly expressed in the foetal hippocampus and differentially regulated in the normal adult hippocampus as well as the hippocampus of alzheimer's disease sufferers  <cit> . mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  were also expressed highly in the developing mouse brain. together with let-7c, both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are over-expressed by at least 50% in the foetal hippocampus of individuals with down syndrome compared to age and sex matched controls suggesting that mirnas are playing an important role in this brain region, which is pertinent for learning and long-term memory formation  <cit> . interestingly, the mir-103- <dig> , mir- <dig> , mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  families have not previously been associated with the development of the brain, but were found to be highly expressed in our dataset. both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are paralogous mirnas and have been associated with lipid metabolism  <cit> . mir- <dig> plays a crucial role in modulating haematopoietic lineage differentiation  <cit>  whereas mir- <dig> has been strongly implicated with kidney development and nephropathies  <cit> .

the identification of brain-related mirnas by our deep sequencing analysis shows that the dataset is reliable not only for characterising expression profiles of known mirnas but also for discovery of novel mirnas. further investigation of these mirnas may shed light on their regulatory roles in various molecular pathways underlying the development of the embryonic brain.

screening and validation of putative mirnas and pre-mirnas
to identify putative mirnas, we analysed unique tags with a single match to the genome that were annotated as matched to refseq or redundant mouse est sequences or were without annotation. a total of  <dig>  unique tags  were selected under these criteria. we included all sequences with 1- <dig> counts into the analysis because we had found  <dig> known mirnas residing in a similar range of expression within the dataset , suggesting some of the single count unique tags might be true positives. pre-mirna sequences were predicted using the rna <dig> program, a pattern-based method reported previously  <cit> . the program predicted  <dig> putative mirnas with pre-mirna sequences; mm_br_e15_ <dig>  mm_br_e15_ <dig>  mm_br_e15_ <dig>  mm_br_e15_ <dig>  mm_br_e15_ <dig>  mm_br_e15_ <dig>  mm_br_e15_ <dig> and mm_br_e15_ <dig> . the resulting candidate pre-mirna sequences were subjected to hairpin structure or fold prediction using the rnafold program  <cit> . of all the candidate putative mirnas, only  <dig> fulfilled the criteria outlined for mature mirna and pre-mirna  <cit> . these were mm_br_e15_ <dig> , mm_br_e15_ <dig> , mm_br_e15_ <dig> , and mm_br_e15_ <dig>  which featured a 22-23nt mature mirnas and a 70-76nt predicted pre-mirnas . the other  <dig> putative mirnas, mm_br_e15_ <dig>  mm_br_e15_ <dig>  mm_br_e15_ <dig> and mm_br_e15_ <dig> contained a large internal loop, branching stem or oversized pre-mirna structural properties . these putative mirnas were excluded from further analysis.

mm_br_e15_ <dig> was matched to the second intron of the ubiquitin specific peptidase  <dig>  gene. mm_br_e15_ <dig> was matched to a single locus within the mouse genome without any annotations, whereas both mm_br_e15_ <dig> and mm_br_e15_ <dig> mirnas were matched to two different introns of the same est, bu <dig>  we performed a small rna northern analysis on the e <dig>  whole brain small rnas to validate all the  <dig> predictions. we also included mm_br_e15_ <dig>  mm_br_e15_ <dig>  mm_br_e15_ <dig> and mm_br_e15_ <dig> in our northern analysis to serve as negative controls. the analysis confirmed all  <dig> predictions at the mature mirna level for mm_br_e15_ <dig>  mm_br_e15_ <dig> and mm_br_e15_ <dig>  and at the pre-mirna level for mm_br_e15_ <dig> and mm_br_e15_ <dig> . as expected, the northern analysis of negative controls showed no detectable signals for mm_br_e15_ <dig> and mm_br_e15_ <dig>  and multiple bandings for mm_br_e15_ <dig> and mm_br_e15_ <dig>  signifying random by-products due to rna degradation . depending on the biological context of the assessed tissue, mirna may be preserved or accumulated at the pre-mirna level due to specific factors such as the activity levels of dicer, argonaute or nuclear export receptors  <cit> . therefore, we considered the existence of these small rnas validated when either the mature or precursor mirna with specific size was detected using the northern analysis.

further analysis using the university of california, santa cruz  genome browser  <cit>  showed that mm_br_e15_ <dig> was mapped to a region within the mouse genome that is homologous to the rat and horse genomes. other putative mirnas were mapped either to a region specific to the mouse genome  or a region homologous to the rat only  . by using both the full-length and seed sequences of all the  <dig> putative mirnas, we performed homology searches against all the known mirna sequences and were unable to find any orthologous mirnas, indicating that these putative mirnas could be specific to the mouse or rat especially mm_br_e15_ <dig> and mm_br_e15_ <dig>  sequence conservation of mirnas is relatively common among vertebrates as well as invertebrates. for example mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  families are found in many organisms including human, mouse, chicken, zebrafish, frog, worm and fruit fly, with high sequence and expression profile similarity particularly in sensory organs  <cit> . however, lack of sequence homology among mirnas from different organisms does not negate the possibility of functional conservation among them. for example, both lin- <dig> and let- <dig> target multiple sequence motifs at the 3' utr of caenorhabditis elegans hunchback homolog mrna, hbl- <dig>  and regulate its expression in the ventral nerve cord neurones  <cit> . in addition, different mirnas with similarity at the seed region may exert the same effect on a same mrna. drosophila bearded  gene has motifs that are complementary to two different mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  which bear the same seed sequence. both the mirnas target the motifs based entirely on the seed sequence with little or no base-pairing to the 3' region  <cit> . although this phenomenon is rare across different organisms, it proves that functional conservation between non-conserved mirnas may lie within the seed region alone.

mm_br_e15_ <dig> biogenesis is dicer1-dependent
of the  <dig> putative mirnas, we selected mm_br_e15_ <dig> for further characterisation due to its high copy number. first, we evaluated mm_br_e15_ <dig> expression in mouse embryonic stem  cells, with and without dicer <dig> enzyme activity using the stemloop rt-qpcr technique . mm_br_e15_ <dig> was expressed in mes cells with dicer <dig> activity, however its expression was not detected or was weak in cells lacking dicer <dig> activity confirming that mm_br_e15_ <dig> biogenesis is dicer1-dependent . the evaluation of dicer1-dependency using the mes cell model is limited to mirnas that are expressed in this cell type. it is worth noting that dicer1-dependency is not a definitive property for defining mm_br_e15_ <dig> as a novel mirna because endogenous small sirnas are also subjected to the same dicing mechanism in the cytoplasm  <cit> . a recent study reported the dicer1-independent biogenesis of mir- <dig>  in which the catalytic activity of argonaute <dig> was responsible for the pre-mir- <dig> hairpin cleavage process  <cit> .

in this study, we used a number of validation analyses for mm_br_e15_1181: dicer1-dependence, pre-mirna structure prediction and northern analysis to define mm_br_e15_ <dig> as a novel mirna. this novel mirna has been identified as mir- <dig> 

expression profiling of mir- <dig> throughout embryogenesis
the expression of mir- <dig> in mes cells led us to hypothesize that this mirna may play a role in early embryogenesis and therefore we characterised its expression profile throughout development. using stemloop rt-qpcr, we showed that mir- <dig> was expressed in e <dig>  blastocysts . the expression of mir- <dig> reduced  as the blastocysts developed into an early stage embryo at day  <dig> , suggesting that mir- <dig> was either expressed in a spatially restricted manner or generally down-regulated at this stage. to specifically locate the expression of mir- <dig> during embryogenesis, we performed whole mount in situ hybridisation on e <dig>  embryos  and showed that mir- <dig> was expressed throughout the embryo with the exception of the developing heart . stronger expression was observed in the telencephalon, somites, branchial arches, and both forelimb and hindlimb buds. cross sectional analysis of the telencephalon confirmed that mir- <dig> was expressed in the neuroepithelium . whole mount ish analysis on embryos of the same age was performed using mir-scrambled lna probe to serve as the background control  .

to evaluate the expression profile of mir- <dig> in the later stages of embryogenesis, we performed section ish. section ish of the e <dig>  whole embryos showed that mir- <dig> was expressed throughout the embryo, especially in the preplate of the telencephalon, somites and hindlimb region . by e <dig> , mir- <dig> expression was restricted to the cortical plate of the cortical neuroepithelium, striatum, medial pallium  and subventricular/ventricular zone of the superior and inferior colliculi. in e <dig>  embryos, mir- <dig> expression was observed primarily in the cortical plate of the cerebral cortex. in e <dig>  whole brains, mir- <dig> expression was prominent in the cortical plate, piriform cortex and at lower levels, in the hippocampal formation. embryo-wide expression of mir- <dig> during early embryogenesis suggests a pan-regulatory role, possibly functioning as a 'housekeeping' mirna in basic cellular processes. this feature has been described in a few clusters of mirnas expressed in the mouse retina, brain and heart  <cit> . many mirnas have ubiquitous expression patterns and their function remains unclear as they may have roles in subtle mirna networks, which exert combinatorial effects during development  <cit> . contrasting with the almost ubiquitous expression profile in early development, mir- <dig> was not detected in a few regions such as the e <dig>  developing heart and the ventricular zone of the telencephalon/developing cerebrum. this suggests that the function of mir- <dig> may be tissue or cell-specific, especially after e <dig> , this warrants further characterisation.

we also performed stemloop rt-qpcr expression analysis of mir- <dig> in various regions of the mouse brain and organs. using the mouse whole brain, there was a significant difference  in the mir- <dig> expression among e <dig> , e <dig> , e <dig> , e <dig> , postnatal day   <dig>  and p <dig> samples . mir- <dig> expression was found to be increased after e <dig>  and was maintained in postnatal day  <dig>   and p <dig> whole brains. the qpcr analysis supports the previous section ish analysis. no significant differences  in mir- <dig> expression were observed among cerebellum, cerebrum, hippocampus, medulla, olfactory bulb and thalamus . when we compared the expression of mir- <dig> in various adult mouse organs to the p <dig> whole brain, we found significant differences in the expression levels among the organs  . mir- <dig> was found to be expressed at the highest level in the pancreas, followed by the thymus, large intestine, heart, small intestine, kidney, brain, testis, ovary, skin, skeletal muscle, liver, stomach and spleen. similar to the embryonic expression profiles, the diverse expression profile of mir- <dig> in multiple organs of the adult mouse further supports a widespread role in the development and function of these organs.

expression of mir- <dig> is upregulated in differentiating neuronal/glial cells
expression of mir- <dig> was observed in the preplate of the e <dig>  telencephalon and later in the cortical plate of the e <dig> -e <dig>  cerebral cortex, by which time the majority of the cells in these structures are committed to their respective neuronal lineages. this finding further suggests that mir- <dig> may play an important regulatory role during neurogenesis or in neuronal function. to further test this idea, we used p <dig> teratocarcinoma cells as an in vitro model. upon retinoic acid induction and under reduced serum concentration, p <dig> cells differentiate into glutamatergic and glutamate-responsive neurones, glial and fibroblast-like cells  <cit> . we analysed the expression level of mir- <dig> in p <dig> cells  and found a statistically significant  ~2-fold upregulation of mir- <dig> in ~50% differentiated p <dig> cells compared to the proliferating cells . various mirnas have been found to be upregulated during neural differentiation and some of their expression could be negatively regulated by important transcription factors such as oct <dig> and sox <dig>  the expression levels of which gradually diminish as cells differentiate into neurones  <cit> . therefore, increased mir- <dig> expression during p <dig> differentiation raises the possibility that this mirna may have a functional role during neural differentiation or neuronal cell function.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have reported the first deep sequencing analysis of small rnas of a developing mouse brain. we have identified and validated  <dig> putative mirnas from the analysis and further characterised one of them, mir- <dig>  during embryogenesis. a significant finding of the study was the embryo-wide expression profile of mir- <dig> in mid-gestation embryos, which became restricted to the central nervous system, suggesting a role for this mirna in neural differentiation or function.
