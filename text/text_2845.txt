BACKGROUND
rapid and effective responses to pathogenic challenge are essential for the survival of all living organisms. production of host-defence peptides , important effector molecules of the innate immune response, is key to effective anti-microbial activity at many sites, in many eukaryotic species. cathelicidins are a family of host-defence peptides found in a diverse range of species, including hagfish  <cit> , amphibians  <cit> , fish  <cit> , birds  <cit> , snakes  <cit>  and mammals . initially named antimicrobial peptides  and categorised by their ability to act as endogenous antibiotics by disrupting microbial cell membranes  <cit> , it is now becoming clear that their biological activity is multifunctional and includes chemotactic and immunoregulatory activities  <cit> . for example, the human cathelicidin peptide ll- <dig> , is chemotactic for neutrophils, monocytes and t cells  <cit>  and has been shown to influence dendritic cell and monocyte function as well as tlr signalling  <cit> .

cathelicidins are so called because of a highly conserved n-terminal-coding region of the precursor protein known as the cathelin domain, followed by a highly variable domain which codes for peptides with antimicrobial activity   <cit> . the cathelin domain contains two disulfide bonds between cysteine residues c85-c <dig> and c107-c <dig>  and was given its name based on sequence similarity to a protein called cathelin, a member of the cystatin superfamily of cysteine proteinase inhibitors   <cit> .

although ubiquitous in mammals, the number of cathelicidin genes in the genome of any single species varies. for instance, while humans and mice have a single cathelicidin gene which codes for an α-helical mature peptide, multiple cathelicidin genes have been found in cattle and sheep  <cit> . in these latter species, the expanded cathelicidin repertoire also includes linear peptides whose mechanism of action may be different to the ancestral α-helical structures  <cit> .

the bovine lineage was one of the first in which cathelicidins were discovered during studies of the antimicrobial activity of bovine neutrophil lysates  <cit> . in particular, indolicidin, which was first discovered in bovine neutrophils  <cit>  has been shown to exert antimicrobial activity against a number of well-known pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus <cit> . additional cathelicidin genes have been discovered in the bovine genome using molecular cloning strategies  <cit> . to date, at least seven distinct protein-coding cathelicidin genes have been identified in the bovine genome and are found in a single cluster on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . southern blot analysis of bovine genomic libraries identified a second copy of cathl <dig> and of cathl <dig>  as well as two related genes that were found to contain premature stop codons  <cit> .

when tested for in vitro antimicrobial activity, cathelicidins rapidly killed a wide range of microorganisms . bmap- <dig> and bmap- <dig> peptides, encoded by cathl <dig> and cathl <dig> respectively, display significant levels of antimicrobial activity against e. coli when assayed in milk from cows with mastitis  <cit>  . the importance of cathelicidins in vivo can be inferred from their localisation at sites which are exposed to microbial invasion as well as in leukocytes. ll- <dig> has been detected in human neutrophils, mast cells, monocytes and macrophages  <cit> . epithelial cells in skin, gut, lung, epididymis and mammary gland are other important sources of ll- <dig>  <cit> , which is therefore thought to have a key role in host defence at sites that are in contact with the external environment  <cit> . cathl <dig> transcript has been detected in the mammary gland of healthy cows, but a significant increase in transcript levels in animals with a naturally-occurring intramammary infection was not observed  <cit> .

the sequencing of the bovine genome has provided an opportunity for detailed study of the cathelicidins in a ruminant species. initial examination of the complete cathelicidin cluster by elsik et al.  <cit>  indicated there were three additional cathelicidin genes, which they called cathelicidin  <dig>  cathelicidin  <dig> and cathelicidin  <dig>  later dawson et al. <cit>  searched for immune gene family expansions in artiodactyls and also identified three potential novel bovine cathelicidin genes, which they named cathl2l, cathl3l <dig> and cathl3l <dig>  however although both groups identified  <dig> cathelicidins in the bovine genome, the two sets of results were not completely congruent, with differences in the positioning of the novel sequences relative to the known cathelicidins in the cluster. here, we attempt to reconcile these differences by conducting a comprehensive annotation of the cathelicidin locus in bos taurus using homology-based search methods of the blast family of programs  <cit>  and the more sensitive hidden markov models  approach  <cit> . we examined cathelicidin expression in somatic cells isolated from milk samples from animals with high somatic cell counts , a metric commonly used to detect intramammary infection . we also used an in vivo model of mastitis to examine cathelicidin expression across several regions of the mammary gland.

RESULTS
characterisation of the bovine cathelicidin gene cluster
the bostau <dig> assembly of the bovine genome provided us with the opportunity to reconstruct the full cathelicidin region for this species. a hmm profile was constructed based on the alignment of protein sequences corresponding to the seven known bovine cathelicidins. this was then used to search the sequenced bovine genome which had been translated in all six reading frames. evidence for the presence of all seven protein-coding cathelicidin genes was found on chromosome  <dig>  of the bovine genome bostau <dig> assembly . two copies of cathl <dig> were detected within this locus, as were second copies of exons  <dig> and  <dig> of cathl <dig>  this is in agreement with the results obtained by scocchi et al. <cit>  using southern blotting and indicates that our findings are not the result of genome assembly errors. all cathelicidin genes are clustered in an approximately 100 kb length of dna, located on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> . the genes are localized on one strand and all are transcribed in the same direction.

this search led to the identification of  <dig> cathelin-containing motifs additional to the seven protein expressing genes already annotated: one intact gene, two genes containing premature stop codons and one partial gene duplication. chromosomal location and strand orientation of the identified cathelicidins was determined using the blast-like alignment tool  at the university of california, santa cruz genome browser .

genomic dna corresponding to these putative cathelicidins was used for prediction of intron/exon boundaries with genscan software  before the additional predicted cathelicidin sequences were compared with those proposed by previous authors  <cit>  . clustalw, in mega  <dig>   <cit> , was used to align the additional cathelicidin sequences found in our analysis with the cathl <dig>  cathl <dig> and cathl <dig> genes described by elsik et al. <cit> , as downloaded from the bovine genome database . cathl <dig> corresponds with the partial copy of the single intact gene we found. however the third and fourth exon of our predicted intact gene share a high level of sequence similarity with other bovine cathelicidins , yet differ from that predicted by elsik et al. another copy of the first two exons of this putative gene lies adjacent. cathl <dig> is identical to one of the pseudogenes, with the exception of a tryptophan residue in place of the stop codon we have predicted, while our analysis also predicts a different fourth exon. cathl <dig> appears to be identical to the duplication of cathl <dig> we have annotated.

the same procedure was used to align the additional cathelicidin sequences found in our analysis with the ensembl sequence ids referenced by dawson et al. <cit>  for cathl2l, cathl3l <dig> and cathl3l <dig>  based on these alignments, cathl2l is 100% identical to the partial duplication of cathl <dig>  while cathl3l <dig> is 100% identical to the pseudogenised version of cathl <dig> we have predicted. the remaining pseudogene we found shares full sequence similarity with cathl3l <dig>  based on these results, we named the predicted additional cathelicidin genes cathl <dig>  cathl3l <dig> and cathl <dig>  following the rule of priority . see additional files  <dig> and  <dig> for the predicted structures of cathl <dig> and cathl3l <dig> respectively.

cathl <dig> displayed all the characteristics of a functional cathelicidin including  <dig> kilobase size and a conserved four exon – three intron arrangement  with a tata-box just upstream from the transcription start site and a polyadenylation signal located 54 bp from the stop codon . in addition, several potential recognition sites for transcription factors involved in the transcription of immune-related genes were found in the 5′ flanking region of this predicted gene . however, alternative 5′ splice junctions were predicted, changing the 3′ boundary of exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> when compared to cathelicidins 1- <dig> . therefore, the predicted sequences and their intron-exon boundaries are not consistent with cathelicidins 1- <dig>  and as a result, cathl <dig> does not display the canonical cysteine spacing that is invariably conserved among other cathelicidin family members  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of all protein-coding and predicted bovine cathelicidins revealed that all the predicted putative cathelicidin genes had highest nucleotide identity to cathl <dig> . bootstrap support is relatively low at all nodes because the cathelin-like domain, which is encoded by three out of the four exons, is so highly conserved, meaning the evolutionary signal is mostly coming from the relatively short but variable fourth exon.

cathelicidin gene expression in tissues from healthy mammary gland
we used quantitative real-time pcr  to examine the tissue expression patterns of cathelicidins 1- <dig> in bovine alveolar, ductal, gland cistern and teat canal tissues from the mammary gland of  <dig> healthy animals and  <dig> animals which had been experimentally-infected with staphylococcus aureus. only cathl <dig> mrna was detected. this was present across all regions in each animal, but did not increase in the infected animals . once again, none of the samples was positive for cathl <dig> or cathl <dig> using any of the primer sets we designed.

cathelicidin gene expression in milk cells from animals with a high somatic cell count
expression of cathelicidin genes 1- <dig> was analysed in somatic cells extracted from milk samples taken from  <dig> cows with a high somatic cell count . while six of the seven genes already known to be protein-coding were expressed, expression patterns were highly variable between animals, with no one cathelicidin gene being expressed in all samples. neither cathl <dig> nor cathl <dig> expression was detected.

discussion
in this study, we used the most recent assembly of the bovine genome to characterise the cathelicidin gene cluster with a view to reconciling older functional studies with more recent genomic analyses whose results were not fully congruent. it should be noted that these analyses were each carried out on one particular assembly of the genome, of which there have been several, with each being slightly different with respect to the cathelicidin cluster . this search identified seven genes already known to code for functional proteins . we also found three additional putative genes whose function is unclear, along with one complete and two incomplete gene duplications clustered on chromosome  <dig> .

phylogenetic analysis  indicates cathl <dig>  cathl <dig> and cathl3l <dig> are most similar to cathl <dig>  which gives rise to a linear protein whose proline and arginine-rich motifs are responsible for its antimicrobial function  <cit> . gennaro et al. found that cathelicidin peptides of this type need at least  <dig> residues to be functional. cathl <dig> fulfils this criterion, with an antimicrobial domain of  <dig> residues which contains several proline-arginine repeats  <cit>  . despite the sequencing results of this gene indicating a stop codon in exon  <dig>  scocchi et al. were able to detect a transcript in bovine bone marrow rna via northern blotting using an oligonucleotide probe based on the antimicrobial domain  of this gene  <cit> . on further examination, this transcript was found to consist of exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of cathl <dig>  which is adjacent to cathl <dig>  with exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of cathl <dig>  a peptide based on the antimicrobial domain of cathl <dig> was synthesised and was found to have antimicrobial properties against e. coli at low salt concentrations  <cit> . therefore cathl <dig>  may extend the bovine cathelicidin repertoire through unusual transcription mechanisms.

based on the gene expression profiling carried out here, the  <dig> known protein-coding cathelicidin genes are constitutively expressed in a broad range of tissue types , including the mammary gland. cathelicidin proteins are a major component of the neutrophil secondary granule and increased levels of these proteins are observed in a range of inflammatory conditions  <cit> . extensive neutrophil recruitment from the circulation to the lumen of the mammary gland is a hallmark of the early immune response to mammary infection  <cit> . as an initial step to evaluate the role of the bovine cathelicidins in mammary gland defence, the expression pattern of cathelicidin genes in somatic cells isolated from milk samples was examined. while mrnas of six of the seven protein-coding cathelicidins were detected, there was no single pattern of expression among the five animals studied .

pryor et al. <cit>  used a pan-cathelicidin antibody targeting the cathelin-like domain along with antibodies targeting cathelicidin proteins  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> to carry out western blotting on milk samples from  <dig> cows with naturally-occurring mastitis involving a range of pathogens. in addition to finding considerable inter-animal variation in the pattern of individual cathelicidin proteins secretion, several samples tested positive with the consensus antibody, yet tested negative with the three specific antibodies. the authors posited that this may be due to the secretion of additional cathelicidin proteins besides those tested. our results using leukocytes extracted from milk indicate this is probably the case.

the same group have also induced an intramammary staphylococcus uberis infection and measured levels of cathelicidin protein in milk using the antibody specific for targeting the cathelicidin consensus sequence, comparing these results to those from animals with naturally occurring infection  <cit> . while there was a strong correlation between cathelicidin protein concentration and the progression of infection as measured by somatic cell count in the experimentally-infected animals, the results obtained from animals with naturally-occurring mastitis were less conclusive, as a quarter of animals testing positive for bacterial infection had no detectable cathelicidin protein in their milk.

we hypothesised that our in vivo mastitis model may similarly build upon existing data on cathelicidin expression in the mammary gland gathered from naturally infected animals  <cit> . this model has previously demonstrated that the expression of several innate immune molecules both increases in staphylococcus aureus infected animals and varies across different regions in the gland  <cit> . however this was not the case for the cathelicidins. cathl <dig> was the only gene whose transcript was detected. while it is constitutively expressed it was not upregulated 48 hours after infection . more extensive analyses of all the cathelicidins across the full spectrum of infection of the mammary gland will be required to determine their effect in this important clinical condition.

it is possible that additional reagents for each hdp may reveal more subtle differences in expression for each cathelicidin. our demonstration of significant expression of cathl <dig> in mammary tissue as well as milk somatic cells suggests that other cells in addition to immune cells are capable of secreting these potent immunomodulatory molecules.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we used the recently released bostau <dig> assembly of the bovine genome to reconstruct the full cathelicidin gene repertoire for this species. in addition to cathelicidins 1- <dig> which are known to code for distinct peptides, three putative cathelicidin genes cluster on chromosome ; two of these are pseudogenes and one a potentially functional cathelicidin gene. we also identified two cathl <dig> genes adjacent to each other on bta <dig>  our in vivo data indicate that cathl <dig> is constitutively expressed in the healthy mammary gland, while transcripts of several other protein-coding genes can be detected in leukocytes extracted from the milk of animals with a high somatic cell count.
