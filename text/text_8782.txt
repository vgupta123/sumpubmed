BACKGROUND
the advances in systems biology have raised the importance of quantitative methods for studying various systems in molecular biology. in recent years, various research methods, including mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, computer simulation and visualization, have been employed to investigate the dynamic or statistical properties of regulatory networks. in particular, mathematical models have been widely used to describe the dynamics of complex systems inside the cell, including genetic regulatory networks, cell signalling transduction pathways and metabolic pathways  <cit>  <cit> . however, these substantial progresses have further raised a number of fundamental and challenging issues that require to be addressed imperatively.

one of the major challenges in systems biology is how to use simple mathematical models to describe complex biological systems. to address this issue, a number of modelling techniques have been designed. among them, a widely used approach is to use one-step reaction to represent multi-step reactions, which is also called slow reaction. this technique is very important because recent theoretical and experimental studies have shown that a wide variety of biochemical events involve multi-step reactions  <cit> . perhaps the most important example of multi-step reactions is transcriptional and translational processes that produce mrna transcripts and proteins, respectively. other examples include molecules  degradation and telomere length shortening processes. in fact, the process of multi-step reactions also exists in other areas such as organic chemistry and biophysical chemistry  <cit>  <cit> . therefore the major aim of this research work is to design simplified models to accurately characterize biological systems with multi-step reactions.

a widely used approach to simplify multi-step chemical reactions in the literature is to use one-step reaction. for example, the degradation process of mrna or protein has been modelled by a first order reaction. however, since the one-step reaction cannot provide consistent description of the multi-step reactions, chemical reactions with time delay have been designed recently to model the multi-step chemical events more accurately  <cit>  <cit>  <cit>  <cit> . another important factor is noise in biological networks that may influence the system dynamics substantially. the deterministic modelling methods, which approximate molecular numbers using continuous concentrations  <cit>  <cit> , may not be appropriate to describe systems that contain species with small population numbers. to model stochastic systems more accurately, there are a few other ways. for example, we can use discrete markov processes where the density of states of a well-stirred chemical reaction system at each time point can be represented by the chemical master equation   <cit>  <cit> . one of the most well-known methods is called the stochastic simulation algorithm , which is a statistically exact method for simulating trajectories of the cme as the system evolves in time  <cit> .

furthermore, to deal with the intrinsic noise in reactions with time delay, the delay stochastic simulation algorithm  was designed by introducing time delay into the ssa  <cit>  <cit> . unlike the ssa, which assumes that biochemical reactions are instantaneous and independent, the dssa characterizes chemical systems that contain both fast and slow reactions. this delayed modelling approach has been applied to many physical and biological systems  <cit> . the dssa was also extended to describe chemical events that have multiple delays or stochastic delay that follows a given probabilistic distribution  <cit>  <cit> . in recent years, the dssa has been widely used to simulate the dynamics of genetic regulatory networks and cell signalling pathways  <cit>  <cit>  <cit>  <cit>  <cit> . in addition, a number of effective simulation methods have been proposed to reduce the huge computing load of the dssa  <cit>  <cit>  <cit>  <cit> . recently the work done by luis mier-y-terán-romero et al. opened some new aspects for the application of time delays in biological systems. time delay may not be a constant that was assumed before  <cit> . other modelling techniques proposed recently include the slow-scale linear noise approximation and stochastic quasi-steady-state assumption  <cit>  <cit> . most recently a new modelling approach has been proposed to simulate chemical reaction systems with memory reactions  <cit> .

the degradation process of mrna molecules is an important step in the regulation of gene expression, which also represents a typical system with multi-step reactions  <cit> . although the mechanisms of mrna degradation have been studied extensively during the last ten years, there are still a number of open problems with respect to the function of enzymes, structure of pathways and role of p-bodies, etc. in the regulation of mrna degradation  <cit>  <cit>  <cit> . a major step in the quantitative study of mrna degradation was the development of mathematical models based on the detailed chemical processes. a linear multi-component model was designed to investigate the nonsense-mediated decay of mrna molecules in yeast  <cit>  <cit> . this deterministic model for mrna degradation process consists of  <dig> first-order reactions that describe transcription, translocation, ploy shortening, decapping and digestion process. computer simulations suggested that the widely used concept of half-life underestimated the averaged life-span of mrna molecules; however, it is still a major factor that determines the life-span of different steps in the degradation pathway. in addition, robustness analysis showed that the change of degradation rate constant led to large variations of mrna copy numbers. to interpret the complexity of mrna degradation in a simpler manner, we proposed a multi-step reaction model using a chain of  <dig> chemical reactions, which gave very good approximation to the detailed one  <cit> .

chemical reactions with time delay has been used to further simplify mathematical models of mrna degradation. here time delay represents the time required in the multi-step reactions except the first reaction  <cit> . this simplified model was also extended to using stochastic time delay. however, numerical results showed that these first-order reaction models with delay did not give good approximation to the detailed degradation process  <cit> . instead of using time delay to represent the missing intermediate reactions in the multi-step reaction, we recently proposed a new modelling approach by introducing a novel concept, namely the length of a molecule indicating its location in the multi-step reactions. deterministic models using ordinary differential equations have been used to find the optimal value in a non-linear probability function  <cit> . however, it is still a challenge to apply this concept to stochastic models that are much more important than deterministic models for chemical reaction systems. thus this work further validates the proposed model using stochastic simulations. we first introduce a new stochastic modelling method with two variables for describing chemical events with multi-step reactions, and then propose a stochastic simulation algorithm to numerically calculate the probability of the firing of the last reaction in the multi-step events. the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are examined by studying the mrna degradation process of gene prl <dig> based on experimental data.

RESULTS
a new two-variable model
the starting-point of this research work is the chemical events with multi-step reactions. using the notation proposed in  <cit> , we consider the following chemical reactions

  b <dig> →k1b <dig> →k2b <dig> →k3⋯ →knbn →knp. 

where bi are molecular species and ki rate constants. it is assumed that each molecule in the system will eventually turn to the product p or degrade if p = (). during this process, each molecule will pass through a number of states b <dig>  b <dig>  . . . , bn via the multi-step reactions.

when the number of reaction step n is large, we need to design a smaller scale model to simplify the multi-step reactions. we first consider the total number of molecules in the system, defined by

  x=∑i=1n. 

here we introduce a new concept to describe the system state. the number of reactions for a molecule to reach the product p is termed as the length of that molecule. thus the length of molecule bi is  and the total length of the molecules in the system is

  l=∑i=1n. 

according to the total molecule number, chemical reactions in the system can be classified into two groups. if one of the first  step reactions occurs, namely bi →kibi+ <dig>  the total number of molecules x is unchanged but the total length l is decreased by one,

  →. 

however, if the last reaction bn →knp fires, both the total number and total length will decrease by one,

  →. 

in this work we use reactions  and  to design the two-variable reaction model.

the key question now is how to determine whether reaction  or  will fire if one of the reactions in the multi-step process  happens. we denote the probability for the degradation of one molecule, namely the firing of reaction , as f , and then the corresponding probability for reaction  as  <dig> − f . it is clear that, when all molecules are of full length , the probability of f is zero; while when x = l, the probability is one. for the molecules with other lengths, we developed an algorithm, namely algorithm i in the method section, to calculate the probability of molecule degradation. with the help of this algorithm, we numerically calculated the exact probability f  using n =  <dig> and x =  <dig> as an example. the probability is represented in figure  <dig> as the solid line.

next we find an appropriate probability function to approximate the calculated curve in figure  <dig>  note that the total length l of x molecules satisfies x ≤ l ≤ nx . when l = x , all molecules have length  <dig>  the probability of firing of the last step reaction is  <dig>  i.e. f  = 1; when l = nx , all molecules have length n, there is no chance for the final reaction to occur in the next step, i.e. f  =  <dig>  therefore we suggested a probability function to approximate the curve in figure  <dig> in the following format:

  f=1-l-xx. 

the approximated probability through the proposed function  is plotted as the straight dashed line in figure  <dig>  it shows that the approximated values are not close to the exact probability values, and the exact probability curve is in a quadratic-like form. hence, instead of using a linear probability f in terms of x , l and n , we introduced another parameter q into this approximation, and proposed the following two expressions for the probability function f in terms of l, x, n, and q. one candidate is

  typei:f=1-l-xxq, 

and the alternative expression is

  typeii:f=1-l-xxq. 

determination of probability function
the major work of this research is to select a probability function from  and  and also search the optimal value of parameter q in the probability function. using algorithm i in the method section, we first calculated the probability f  with different values of the total molecule number x , different numbers of reaction step n  and various values of the total length l . the calculated probability was used as the exact value to search the optimal q in the proposed probability functions. to select a better probability function, we used both type i and ii functions to calculate the probability f  using the same initial condition  but different values of q  in a step size of  <dig> . by searching for the smallest difference between the exact probability values and those obtained from approximated functions with different q, the optimal values of q for two approximations were achieved which are  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively in this particular case. the exact and approximated probability values are shown in figure  <dig>  we found that the type ii approximation is closer to the exact probabilities than the type i approximation. then we only used the probability function  for the following studies.

to establish a more general formula for defining q under different conditions of x, l, n, we extended the simulations to various initial conditions of n, x both varying from  <dig> to  <dig> together with different values of q. the optimal q values acquired under these conditions are illustrated by figure  <dig>  and . figure  <dig>  shows that when n increases, the optimal value of q increases for a fixed x value; while figure  <dig>  indicates that there is no significant variation for the optimal q when x increases for a fixed n value. therefore, we calculated the averaged optimal q values under various value of n for each given x. a plot of this averaged optimal q ¯ against n is shown in figure  <dig> . we suggested a linear relationship between n and q. a linear regression analysis suggested that this relationship is

  q ¯= <dig> n+ <dig> . 

we have developed deterministic models of ordinary differential equations  based on the multi-step reactions  and the two-variable model   <cit> . simulation results of the deterministic models gave some similar patterns such that the optimal value of q increases when the number of chemical reactions n increases. the established relationship between the optimal value of q and related model parameters, which is also shown in figure  <dig>  is given by

  q ¯= <dig> n+ <dig> . 

the above equation is slightly different from expression . for example, when n =  <dig>  the averaged value of optimal q is found to be  <dig>  using probability simulation while it is  <dig>  from the ode simulation. the possible reason of the difference is that the ode model is not the best approach for describing chemical reaction systems with molecules of small copy numbers and some model errors may arise from the ode simulations. a combination of regression analyses is shown in figure  <dig> 

even with the different formulations for the optimal q values, we still find that the ode method confirms the conclusion derived from stochastic simulations. based on both stochastic and deterministic simulations, we found that the value of q is associated with the number of reaction step n, but not connected to the total molecule number x. our results also suggested that, when the value of q approaches the optimal one, simulation error of the two-variable model using q is very close to that using the optimal q value. using the function derived from stochastic simulations, the probability function of molecule degradation is given by

  f=1-l-xx <dig> n+ <dig> . 

using this probability function, we designed an algorithm, namely algorithm ii in the method section, to simulate the two-variable reaction model based on the ssa.

mrna decay dynamics: case study for gene rpl30
in this section, we apply the established theory in the previous section to study the dynamics of mrna degradation. here we use gene ribosomal protein l <dig>  as the test system with a dataset generated from experiments. in these experiments, two constructs of rpl <dig> were used to demonstrate the decay kinetics of the mrna transcripts  <cit> . the first construct  contains the act <dig> uas , and the other  contains the rpl <dig> uas. the mrna molecule decay dynamics was monitored after blocking transcription by using drug  <dig> -phenanthroline  <cit> . thus we assumed that there was no further transcription during the monitoring process. the decay dynamics was normalized by the rpl <dig> transcript level at time zero , which was set to 100%. using the endogenous rpl <dig> mrna levels obtained from the two construct  <cit> , we first used the one-step differential equation model

  dxdt=-kx 

to simulate the decay dynamics  <cit> .

to model mrna degradtion, cao and parker proposed a multi-component model that includes mrna transcript synthesis, mrna translocation, poly-shortening process, and terminal deadenylation  <cit> . we have proposed a simplified model by putting a number of terminal deadenylation reactions into a single one  <cit> . this simple model is a typical multi-step reaction process. in this model, mrna transcript is synthesized by a zero-order reaction s <dig>  then mrna molecules translocate from the nucleus to cytosal via reaction s <dig>  the mrna molecules in the cytosol produce proteins by the translational process, and in the meantime, the length of mrna begins to decrease via a number of poly-shortening reactions s <dig>  . . . , s <dig>  the final reaction in this process is the further exonucleolytic degradation s <dig>  which is regarded as the degradation reaction in this work, since the fragment product  has no function to produce protein molecules.

based on the reactions listed in table  <dig> and rate constants, the propensity functions of these reactions are listed below.

the rate constants si are in the unit of 1/sec.

  reaction propensity functiondna →s1aa1=s <dig> a →s1ba2=s <dig> ,b →s3bc1a3=s <dig> ,bc <dig> →s4bc2a4=s <dig> ,bc <dig> →s5bc3a5=s <dig> ,bc <dig> →s6bc4a6=s <dig> ,bc <dig> →s7bc5a7=s <dig> ,bc <dig> →s8bc6a8=s <dig> ,bc <dig> →s9bc7a9=s <dig> ,bc <dig> →s10fga10=s <dig> , 

following the experimental conditions, it is assumed that s <dig> =  <dig>  for simplicity, it is assumed that s <dig> = . . . = s <dig>  when using the two-variable model to study the mrna degradation process, we write the total copy number x and total length of mrna molecules l as

 x=+++⋯+,l=9+8+7b+⋯+. 

here we put the mrna synthesis as a separate reaction. then the remaining nine reactions  form a chemical event of multi-step reactions. the dynamics of variables × =  is described by the following reactions together with the corresponding propensity functions

  reaction propensity functiondna→k1a1=k <dig> →ka2=k⋅x⋅),→ka3=k⋅x⋅f. 

using the assumption s <dig> = . . . = s <dig>  the rate constant k  is the harmonic mean of rate constants s <dig>  . . . , s <dig>  given by

  k=8∑i=2101si=si. 

next we used the proposed two-variable model to give more accurate simulations. we first estimated the degradation rate constant k and optimal initial total length of transcripts. we have also estimated the degradation rate constant k by assuming that the total initial length is a half of the maximal total length , which is termed as the averaged total length. to reduce the computing time, we first estimated parameters in the ode model  using different initial transcript numbers . table  <dig> suggests that the variation between the estimate rate constant k was very small for different initial mrna numbers. similar observation is applied to the ratio of the optimal initial total length to the maximal total initial length, namely l0/, for the tests with different initial mrna numbers. thus our results suggested that the estimated model parameters are independent to the initial mrna copy numbers.

using the estimated model parameters of the case x <dig> =  <dig>  simulation results for the two constructs in figure  <dig>  and  show that the two-variable model provides more accurate description of the mrna degradation dynamics than the one-step model, in particularly for that in the first  <dig> minutes. for the act <dig> construct in figure  <dig> , the optimal length number with ratio  <dig>  gave more accurate simulation than the averaged length number. however, in figure  <dig>  for the rpl <dig> transcript, the difference between the simulations using two different length numbers is small. in this case, the optimal ratio is  <dig> , which is very close to  <dig> .

to further examine the accuracy of the two-variable model, we used the stochastic model to simulate the mrna dynamics using different initial transcript numbers. for each initial mrna number, we generated  <dig>   <dig> simulations and then calculated the averaged mrna numbers of all stochastic simulations. for both constructs in figure  <dig>  and , our results show that there is small difference between the simulations using x <dig> =  <dig> and x <dig> =  <dig>  however, there is not any significant difference between simulations when the initial mrna number is larger than  <dig> 

finally we provided a few stochastic simulations for mrna degradation dynamics for the construct act <dig> in single cells. the rate constants of the detailed model were derived from the two-variable model using the relationship ; and the initial molecular numbers were randomly selected while the length of the initial molecules matches the length in the two-variable model. when the mrna synthesis rate is s <dig> =  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows that the molecular numbers and lengths approaches to zero at the time point around  <dig>  in addition, compared with the simulations of the detailed model in figure 6a and 6c, the two-variable model generates simulations with more fluctuations in figure 6b and 6d. after the time point  <dig>  more simulations of the two-variable model still have non-zero molecular numbers.

CONCLUSIONS
this work represents an attempt to use simplified mathematical models to describe complex biological systems. concentrating on the chemical events of multi-step reactions, we proposed a new concept  as an additional measure to characterize system dynamics. the length of a molecule is defined as the location of a molecule in the multi-step reactions. using the total molecule number and total length of molecules, we proposed a two-variable model to reduce the complexity of the multi-step reactions. the major contribution of this work is to design a nonlinear function that represents the probability of the firing of the last reaction in the multi-step reactions. to calibrate this probability function, we proposed a stochastic simulation method to calculate the probabilities of various system states. numerical results suggested that this probability is dependent on the number of reaction steps but independent of the total molecule number, which suggested that we were able to design a simplified model based on the network structure. then our proposed two-variable model was applied to simulate the dynamics of mrna degradation using experimentally observed data. numerical results suggested that the length of molecules, which is approximately a half of the maximal length initially, played an important role in realizing experimental data. the potential future work includes the application of the two-variable model to other multi-step reaction systems such as gene expression and telomere length regulation. in addition, the refinement of the two-variable model, such as the accuracy of the probability function, would also be very interesting.
