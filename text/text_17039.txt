BACKGROUND
lentil , a self pollinating crop with an approximate genome size of  <dig> gbp  <cit>  is an important legume which provides quality protein, carbohydrates, fibre and minerals for the humans and fodder for livestock. it is a moderately drought tolerant crop  <cit> , but the yield is drastically reduced with increased drought stress. as water availability is important for crop growth and productivity, drought stress at critical stage with high severity can impose a threat to world food security. it ranks as the single most common cause of severe food shortages mostly in the developing parts of the world and represents far-reaching natural trigger of malnutrition and famine  <cit> . the mechanisms for drought tolerance in plants are very complex and highly variable  <cit> . although, the tolerance to drought stress in lentil varies considerably among genotypes yet genomic information pertaining to drought stress is limited in this crop. for germplasm enhancement and to develop hardy lentil plants with tolerance to drought stress, understanding of molecular mechanisms governing response towards drought stress is necessary.

drought stress induces a number of biochemical and physiological responses which are controlled by a number of genes at molecular, cellular and whole plant level that helps in maintaining water and ionichomeostasis and protect the plant from wilting and destined death. this can be achieved by maintaining osmotic compatibility within the cell, reconstruction of primary and secondary metabolism and by restoration of proteins in their native folded tertiary structure. most well reported mechanisms of drought stress tolerance has been related to accumulation of n metabolites like proline, glycine betaine, soluble carbohydrates antioxidants etc. which help in maintaining the vital properties of the cell . several major classes of genes have been documented whose expressions are altered under drought stress. most prominent among them are those involved in cellular metabolism, including cellular detoxification e.g., aldehyde dehydrogenase family genes; genes involved in cellular transport and signal transduction e.g. for aba responses; genes encoding transcription factors which are involved in transcriptional regulation and genes for hydrophilic and heat-soluble proteins e.g., late embryogenesis abundant  genes, etc.  <cit> . functional genes comprised of heat shock proteins, facilitating protein refolding and stabilizing polypeptides and membranes under drought stress. endogenous abscisic acid , content increases under drought stress which protects the plant from immediate desiccation by stomatal closure  <cit> . aba has been shown to regulate expression of few genes under drought stress  <cit> .

recent developments of next generation sequencing  technologies have enabled mass sequencing of genomes and transcriptomes, which produce a vast array of genomic information  <cit> . genome wide expression studies provide to breeders a framework of dataset to understand the molecular basis of complex traits. using ngs technology, bett et al. have used lentil cultivar, cdc redberry to develop an initial draft of 23x coverage which covered over half the lentil genome   <cit> . single nucleotide polymorphisms  derived from this draft are available for use in molecular breeding of lentil. kaur et al. have also performed sequence analysis in lentil using second generation sequencing technology and have developed a collection of expressed sequence tags   <cit> . in other legumes like chickpea, transcriptome analysis under drought stress has already been undertaken. hiremath et al. used roche/ <dig> and illumina solexa to identify drought responsive genes and gene based molecular markers including simple sequence repeats , snps and conserved ortholog set  in chickpea  <cit> . a number of transcription factor families and defence related genes were identified in peanut under drought stress, using transcriptome analysis  <cit> . wu et al. have found differentially expressed genes  between terminal drought and optimal irrigation treatments in two different genotypes of common bean i.e. long 22- <dig> and naihua which were functionally associated with drought stress  <cit> . however, information regarding transcriptomic changes under drought stress in lentil is very limited; therefore, to deduce pathways involved in drought stress response, expression study in contrasting genotypes of lentil is essential. significant changes in gene expression are difficult to appraise without comparison. therefore, pdl- <dig> and jl- <dig> which are two contrasting genotypes for drought tolerance, pdl- <dig> being drought tolerant and jl- <dig>  drought sensitive were used in this study  <cit> . this study was undertaken to understand the biochemical mechanisms associated with adaptation to drought stress at seedling stage and to identify differentially expressed genes in contrasting lentil genotypes under drought stress using illuminahiseq <dig> platform.

methods
plant material, cultivation and drought stress treatment
two lentil genotypes: drought tolerant  and drought sensitive  were included in this study. these two genotypes were selected on the basis of previous studies, reporting pdl- <dig> as a drought tolerant breeding line and jl- <dig> was drought sensitive on the basis of seedling survivability  <cit> . pdl- <dig>  a breeding line derived from a cross between ill- <dig> and ill- <dig>  was obtained from international center for agricultural research in the dry areas , syria. jl- <dig> is a released variety of central zone of india and it is selected from landrace of sagar district of madhya pradesh, india.

hydroponic experiment
the hydroponic experiment was conducted at national phytotron facility, indian agricultural research institute , new delhi, india in a completely randomized block design with three replications. air temperature in the controlled environment was 22/ <dig> °c  day/night; photoperiod was 10/ <dig> h light/dark; and the relative humidity was approximately 45%.

drought tolerance was evaluated by the protocol of singh et al. in a nutrient solution culture  <cit> . seeds were disinfected with 1% sodium hypochlorite for 2– <dig> min and rinsed thoroughly with distilled water and then germinated on filter paper. one week old seedlings were transferred to hydroponic medium , ca  <dig> h <dig> , mgso <dig> h2o , kh2po <dig> , kcl , h3bo <dig> , fe-edta , mncl <dig> h2o , znso <dig> h2o , cuso <dig> h2o  and namoo <dig> h2o   <cit> . drought stress was given one week after transplantation of seedlings. two environments were created: drought stress- the seedlings were exposed to air for  <dig> h for a period of  <dig> d. control- the plants were kept in the nutrient solution for the entire period  of development without interruption. the ph of nutrient solution was adjusted at  <dig>  with  <dig> m hcl or  <dig> m koh. the solution was regularly aerated by an aquarium air pump and was replaced on alternate days. after  <dig> d of treatment, both the genotypes were rated for drought tolerance based on scale suggested by singh et al.  <cit> . data on relative water content , membrane stability index , photosynthetic pigments , proline, glycine betaine , lipid peroxidation and antioxidant activities were taken after  <dig> d of drought stress treatment as described previously by singh et al.  <cit> . the experiments were conducted in a completely randomized block design with three replications comprising twelve seedlings per replication.

total ribonucleic acid  extraction and purification
leaf samples were taken from the  <dig> seedlings for each genotype under control and drought stress treatments. total rna was extracted from leaves of drought tolerant line, pdl- <dig> and drought sensitive variety, jl- <dig> from both control and treated samples using qiagen rneasy plant mini kit. ribosomal rna was removed from total rna by using epicentre ribozerorrna removal kit and agencourt rna clean xp kit. equal amounts of total rna extracted from each seedling of each genotype were pooled together.

complementary dna  library construction and sequencing
strand specific cdna library was constructed using truseq rna library preparation kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. the quality of cdna libraries was tested using agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer and quantified cdna was subjected to purification using ampure xp beads. purified cdna was then end repaired, using 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of end repair mix which removed 3′ overhangs and filled 5′ overhangs through its polymerase activity. cdna was then polyadenylated and multiple indexing adapters were ligated to its end. for enrichment of cdna in the library, polymerase chain reaction  was performed which selectively amplified those fragments that have adapter molecules on both the ends. the established cdna libraries were sequenced using illumina hiseq <dig> platform  to generate  <dig> ×  <dig> base paired end-reads.

sequence analysis
raw fastq files obtained from the sequencer were checked for quality parameters of the sequences viz. base quality score distribution, average base content per read and gc distribution in the reads. the base quality score distribution and average base content per read were inferred using phred quality score. the raw fastq files were trimmed before performing de novo transcriptome assembly. first two bases and last ten bases were removed from all the reads. fastq-mcf tool was used for removing adapter sequences. reads of average quality score of less than  <dig> were also filtered out. trinity with default options were used to assemble trimmed reads. transcripts > =  <dig> bp were focussed for transcription expression estimation and downstream annotation. the trimmed reads were aligned to the assembled transcriptome  using bowtie programme.

screening and annotation of degs
differential gene expression studies were performed using deseq program. transcripts having read counts > = <dig> and adjusted p value < =  <dig>  were chosen for differential gene expression analysis. the read counts, transcript expression in fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads  were evaluated in each stage. edward plots were plotted to elucidate comparison of contigs in all the samples, both for upregulated and downregulated contigs. degs between treatments were also identified based on the fpkm value using with the edger program. we combined the statistical test with the multiple-hypothesis-testing correction method benjamini and hochberg  <cit> , which calculates the false discovery rate , to qualify statistically significant, differentially expressed genes by avoiding inflation of type- <dig> errors.

the assembled transcript was annotated using canopi . assembled transcripts were compared with national center for biotechnology information  non-redundant protein database using blastx  programme. matches with e-value < = 10- <dig> and similarity score > = 40% were used for further annotation. for organism annotation, the top blastx hit of each transcript was studied and organism name was extracted. gene and protein annotation was done as perthe matched transcripts. among the total significant blastx hit transcripts  <dig>  were annotated using uniprot  database and for the remaining ones, ncbi predicted protein annotation was done. transcripts with proper gene name from uniprot and differentially expressed transcripts were shown with heat map. gene ontology  terms for transcripts were extracted and were categorized into molecular function, biological process and cellular component categories. enrichment analysis of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  metabolic pathways was performed using kobas . reactome analysis was performed to predict the pathway information for degs.

differential expression verification by quantitative real-time pcr 
accuracy of transcriptome sequencing data was validated by qrt-pcr. rna was extracted from leaves of four biological replicates using qiagenrneasy plant mini kit. quantification of rna was done using nano drop spectrophotometer. total rna sample was reverse transcribed using biorad cdna synthesis kit. variable amount of total rna for different samples was taken for final reaction volume of  <dig> μl. normalization of all the cdna samples was done so as to equalize concentration of  <dig> ng/μl. the primer sequences were designed using primer3plus and are listed in table  <dig>  the β-tubulin gene was used as a reference gene to normalize all the data. the  <dig> μl pcr reaction mixture was comprised of  <dig> μl diluted cdna,  <dig> μl each of forward and reverse primers,  <dig> μl evagreen dye. pcr amplification was carried out at 50o c for  <dig> min, 95o c for  <dig> min and  <dig> cycles consisting of 95o c for  <dig> s and 60o c for  <dig> min as run parameters. the relative quantification method 2- was used to calculate and calibrate the expression level of target genes in different treatments.table  <dig> primers used in rt pcr validation




filtering and alignment of ssrsand snps
snps were predicted using samtools mpileup and custom scripts which call the variants based on read depth. a minimum read depth of  <dig> was used to filter heterozygous loci and false positive snps. in parallel to this, gatk toolkit was also considered to call variants using haplotype caller command version  <dig> - <dig> for snp calling keeping default parameters. misa software was used for filtering ssrs from high quality filtered reads from both the genotypes that were aligned to the contigs and primers were designed using primer <dig> software. minimum primer size of the ssr primers designed using primer <dig> software was  <dig> and maximum primer size was  <dig> with optimal primer size of  <dig>  estimated product sizes from these ssrs were in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> bp.

RESULTS
variation in wilting and seedling survival
differences between genotypes under control and drought stress were found significant for wilting and seedling survival . the effects of stress were first observed on the leaves after  <dig> h of air exposure. the sensitive genotype  showed wilting much earlier than the tolerant lines. tolerant and sensitive genotypes severely wilted when exposed to air for  <dig> h,  and when returned into the nutrient solution and kept for  <dig> h, tolerant genotype  showed much faster recovery. on the other hand, jl- <dig> showed less recovery when returned to the nutrient solution .fig.  <dig> phenotypic responses of genotypes, jl- <dig>  and pdl- <dig> for drought stress. control , air exposure for  <dig> h and  <dig> days , recovery after  <dig> h in nutrient solution

discussion
plant water stress
hydroponic is most effective and practical approach for screening large number of genotypes in small area because it is easy in handling and has possibility of better controlled environment. another advantage is that it is non destructive and plants can be screened at a early stage of growth, and tolerant plants can be selected and transferred to pots or field for further assessment of drought tolerance at subsequent stages of growth  <cit> . in the hydroponic technique, when plants were exposed to air for  <dig> h, all of them initially get wilted . but the marked difference occurred when they were returned to the nutrient solution for  <dig> h, only the tolerant genotype  showed strong recovery, whereas the sensitive genotype  showed less recovery. this suggested that even  <dig> h exposure to stress resulted in completely affected plant metabolism in the sensitive genotype, which was not observed in drought tolerant genotype. the exposure to air did not affect the basic metabolic activities of the plants and they retained the capacity to revive back to normal life when water became available  <cit> . the visual observations of wilting after relatively short durations of air exposure provided a suitable and reliable ranking of genotypes under long-term and/or more severe drought stress conditions. therefore, it suggests that visual assessment of plant wilting and seedling survivability may offer suitable parameters for quick characterization of drought tolerance even at seedling stage.

physiological and biochemical attributes
plant rwc decreased significantly in both lentil genotypes under drought stress but pdl- <dig> maintained significantly higher rwc in both the control and water stressed conditions . it shows that the higher rwc enabled the tolerant lentil genotype to perform better in terms of physio-biochemical processes under water stress conditions. tolerant genotype  produced higher stable yield, probably because water retention ability in plant is one of the components of tolerance mechanisms  <cit> . higher rwc has been reported to be associated with higher level of photosynthetic pigments, membrane stability index, osmolytes and antioxidant activities in maize  <cit> . opening of stomata results in more transpiration and subsequently reduction in rwc. under these conditions, the genotype loses more water, particularly if drought is prolonged, plant recovery is impossible and ultimately it may die. tolerant genotypes can maintain higher rwc in their leaves through stomatal closure and consequently reduction in leaf gas exchange  <cit> . the rwc in leaves of drought stressed cultivars decreased significantly. many researchers have reported large reductions in relative water content and water potential in the leaves under drought stress .

drought stress caused a strong loss of photosynthetic pigments although; pdl- <dig> had higher chlorophyll contents than jl- <dig> under water stress. contrasting effects of drought stress on the plant pigments have been reported previously  <cit> . similarly drought-tolerant genotypes have been reported to maintain higher chlorophyll content than sensitive ones  <cit> .

the synthesis of osmolytes including proline and glycine betaine is widely reported in plants to stabilize membranes and maintain the conformation of proteins at low leaf water potential. but variability in synthesis as well as accumulation of osmolytes occurs among intra and inter plant species. our results showed that lentil genotypes which performed better under water deficit conditions had higher levels of proline and glycine betaine content as compared to those found sensitive to stress conditions . higher proline concentration has been reported to be involved in reducing the photo damage to chloroplast thylakoid membranes by scavenging and/or reducing the production of ros . therefore, higher concentration of proline has been suggested as one of the parameters for selection for stress tolerant plant  <cit> . similarly, proline has also been reported to protect and stabilize ros scavenging enzymes and activate alternative detoxification pathways in plants subjected to various abiotic stresses  <cit> . therefore, higher proline may act as a direct antioxidant as well as an activator of antioxidant mechanisms. accumulation of proline has been associated with drought stress avoidance in maize, wheat and chickpea also  <cit> . glycine betaine  is another effective compatible solute which increases in the chloroplast of plants, when exposed to environmental stresses  <cit> . an increased accumulation of glycine betaine content was noticed in tolerant genotypes. higher level of gb under drought stress has been reported in many plants like barley  <cit> .

mda has been suggested as a marker of oxidative stress-induced lipid injury and its concentration varies in response to abiotic stresses  <cit> . lipid peroxidation, in turn, is an indicator of the prevalence of free radical reactions occurring in tissues and indicates a relationship between drought and oxidative stress  <cit> . the genotypes show better performance under water deficit conditions have been observed to have lower levels of mda content in the roots  thus they protect themselves from lipid peroxidation of membrane systems as compared to the genotypes which had higher levels of mda content. the similar results were observed in wheat and fababean under drought stress conditions  <cit> .

antioxidant enzymes like cat and pox are key enzymes in scavenging and detoxification of hydrogen peroxide, a hazardous by product of photorespiration  <cit> . in this study the activity of these enzymes was induced due to drought stress. the increase in activity was higher in pox across genotypes responding to stress. similar induced activity of above enzymes under stress conditions has been reported previously  <cit> . highest activity of cat in response to drought was observed in pdl- <dig> while lowest pox activity under stress condition was recorded in jl- <dig>  this is clear that these genotypes experienced oxidative stress and their antioxidant enzymes triggered to detoxify cells. these results are in consistence earlier reports showing higher antioxidant enzyme activity in wheat cultivars  <cit> .

transcriptome analysis and stress responsive genes
transcriptome sequences data can be a valuable resources especially for the species without a completely sequenced genome like lentil. in lentil drought stress mediated gene expression has been sparsely studied. in transcriptome analysis, n <dig> is an important criterion to decide the quality of assembly and with a n <dig> value of approximately  <dig>  quality of assembly was found to be very high . a total of  <dig>  upregulated and  <dig>  downregulated transcripts were identified through differential gene expression of drought treated genotypes and their controls. gene expression analysis revealed that genes involved in oxidation-reduction process, correct folding of protein, tca cycle, electron transport chain, organ senescence and reduction of stomatal conductance are more severely upregulated in drought tolerant genotypes than the sensitive ones, whereas genes for transcription binding, gaba synthesis, synthesis of cell wall protein, those involved in negative regulation of absicisic acid etc. are downregulated in tolerant genotype as compared to sensitive ones. in tolerant genotype, the activity of unnamed protein product  which belonged to aldehyde dehydrogenase family was most significantly upregulated with a log <dig> fold change of  <dig> . water stress often results in concentration of reactive toxic molecules like aldehydes, which can cause lipid peroxidation and alteration in proteins and nucleic acids. the aldehyde dehydrogenase family is a large family of enzymes which are regarded as “aldehyde scavengers” and irreversibly convert these aldehydes into acids which will result in less damage caused by several abiotic stresses including drought  <cit> .

other significantly upregulated degs within a log <dig> fold change of  <dig> to  <dig> belonged to 50s ribosomal protein l12- <dig>  citrate synthase  <dig>  succinate dehydrogenase  flavoprotein subunit  <dig>  metallothionein-like protein and nadp-dependent malic enzyme  <dig>  50s ribosomal protein l12- <dig> is a chloroplast precursor and upregulation of its protein may represent the tolerant cultivar attempt to protect and sustain the correct folding of other protein in addition to accelerated degradation of unfolded/incorrectly folded or stress damaged protein  <cit> . citrate synthase  <dig> is peroxisomal citrate synthase which is required for fatty acid respiration in seedlings where citrate is exported from peroxisomes into mitochondria during respiration of triacylglycerol  <cit> . succinate dehydrogenase  flavoprotein subunit  <dig> is located in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex ii and is involved in mitochondrial electron transport. it was upregulated in ilex paraguariensis leaves in response to water deficit and abscisic acid  <cit> . metallothionein-like proteins are low molecular weight, cysteine-rich, soluble, and metal-binding proteins which are found in both plant and animal tissues. involvement of these proteins in drought stress has also been confirmed in peanut  <cit> . gorantla et al. found that metallothionein-like proteins represented the most abundant group of drought stressed transcripts in rice cultivar  which helped in metal detoxification  <cit> . similarly, two genes encoding metallothionein-like proteins were identified which were induced under drought stress in b. napus suggesting function of metallothionein-like proteins in drought stress  <cit> . nadp-dependent malic enzyme  <dig> plays an important role as anti-drought. the majority of water loss from plants occurs through stomata. when stomata are open, the concentration of potassium chloride and/or malate is high in guard cells, which enhance their turgor pressure and results in increased pore size. these are widely distributed in plant, which mainly appear in mitochondria, chloroplast as well as cytoplasm and catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to produce pyruvate, co <dig> and nadph under metallic ions  <cit> . when leaf stoma are closed under drought stress, the malate concentration in cell decreases and nadp-me activity increases  <cit> .

in this study, it was found that under drought stressed condition for tolerant as well as sensitive genotypes there is higher percentage of upregulated degs. further, some of the degs involved in tca cycle, respiratory electron transport chain, ion channel transport, abc family protein mediated transport, hsfs activation, metabolism of glucose are upregulated when tolerant and sensitive genotypes are compared with their controls whereas it has been reported that expression of genes involved in photosynthesis, photorespiration and carbohydrate metabolism were more drastically downregulated in drought tolerant genotypes than the sensitive ones  <cit> .

pathway analysis for drought tolerance
the detailed classification of kegg pathways for degs with 3– <dig> log2fold change fall under  <dig> pathways, where a significant number of degs belonged to secondary metabolism category including stilbenoid, diaryl heptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, diterpenoid biosynthesis along with that of carbon metabolism and citrate cycle; protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, biosynthesis of amino acids, galactose metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, nitrogen metabolism including alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, fatty acid degradation etc. similar results have been reported in ammopiptanthus mongolicus leaves under drought stress  <cit> .

antioxidant enzymes constitute “first line of defence” against ros generated during environmental stresses like drought  <cit> . superoxide dismutase is one of the major classes of antioxidants that catalyzes the first step in ros scavenging system and removes superoxide radicals by converting them into h2o <dig> and o <dig>  <cit> . higher sod activity in drought tolerant lentil genotype, pdl- <dig> may be one of the mechanisms for drought tolerance as at5g <dig> gene was highly upregulated in tolerant genotype under drought stress, which is involved in hydrogen peroxide metabolism in peroxisomes. the production of h2o <dig> can directly be countered by the activities of catalase and nonspecific peroxidise. phenylpropanoids constitute a secondary antioxidant system, and activated upon due to depletion of primary antioxidant defences and control cellular h2o <dig> within a sub-lethal concentration range  <cit> . peroxidase  <dig> upregulated in this study are involved in biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids like p-hydroxy phenyl lignin, guaiacyl lignin and syringyl lignin, which must have played a major role in ros scavenging. phenyl ammonia lyase activity which is a key enzyme involved in biosynthesis of isoprenoid antioxidant compounds was found to increase sharply in tolerant genotype under drought stress condition. similar results have been reported in maize inbreds  <cit> . biosynthesis of other secondary metabolities like stilbenoid, diaryl hepatanoid and gingerol were also found to increase due to upregulation of gene encoding cytochrome p <dig>  polypeptide  <dig>  which is involved in conversion of resveratrol to piceatanol, a crucial step involved in synthesis of these metabolites.

stress-inducible galactinol-synthase, a member of glycosyl transferases family plays a key role in enhancing level of galactinol and raffinose under abiotic stress conditions, which is important osmoprotectants for drought stress tolerance  <cit> . galactinol synthase is involved to transfer of udp-d galactose to myo-inositol and is considered the main regulator of this biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . in this study, galactinol synthase  <dig> gene has been upregulated many folds in both 1c vs  <dig> t and 2c vs  <dig> t comparison groups suggesting its role in regulation of drought tolerance in lentil. several studies have shown that the expression of galactose synthase gene is involved in response to several abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms .

under drought stress conditions, the endoplasmic reticulum  protein folding machinery reaches a limit and the demand for protein folding exceeds its capacity. therefore unfolded or miss-folded proteins increase in the er, and trigger an unfolded protein response. this results in up regulating the expression of genes encoding components of protein folding machinery or the er- associated degradation system  <cit> . the same has been visualized in lentil as the expression of genes encoding heat shock protein  <dig>  which is part of ubiquitin ligase complex and er- associated degradation system and 70b, which is characterized as molecular chaperone and that of heat shock protein  <dig>  were significantly upregulated.

gene encoding glutathione s-transferase tau  <dig> , which is involved in glutathione metabolism, was upregulated in tolerant genotype under drought condition. glutathione s-transferases are involved in protection under various stress conditions by detoxifying endogenous plant toxins which increases under oxidative stress  <cit> . gsts play a major role under drought conditions by conjugation of glutathione with electrophilic substrates to increase their solubility and facilitating further metabolic processing  <cit> . there are reports, which suggest involvement of gsts in drought stress  <cit> . at1g <dig>  the gene upregulated in this study, has been shown to physically interact with far-red insensitive  <dig>  in response to light and play a crucial role in cell elongation and plant development  <cit> .

xyloglucanendo transglucosylase/hydrolase is important enzyme of cell wall and involved in modifying various physiological process for stress tolerance. choa et al. have reported that constitutive expression of abiotic stress inducible hot pepper caxth <dig>  which encodes xyloglucanendo transglucosylase/hydrolase homolog and showed improved drought tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis plants  <cit> . the same protein has been found to be increased in pdl- <dig>  plant, through brassinosteroid induced plant hormone signal transduction pathway under drought stress in this study. under drought conditions, plant needs to reduce shoot growth while maintaining root growth. this process requires differential cell wall synthesis and remodelling. formation of reactive oxygen species and peroxidises are key players in this process, which initially cross link phenolic compounds and glycoproteins of the cell walls causing stiffening. xyloglucan modifying enzymes results in cell wall loosening which allows further growth of stressed organs  <cit> .

absicisic acid dependent pathway can be considered important for drought tolerance in lentil as, gene encoding 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase which is a well known key enzyme for carotenoid biosynthesis, a precursor for aba biosynthesis is highly upregulated in drought tolerant genotype under drought condition  <cit> . increase in cellular aba triggers the activation of several stress responsive genes and the closure of stomata to restrict transpiration  <cit> . the same has been confirmed in several plant species including arabidopsis, cowpea, beans, etc. . genes involved in lysine degradation were also upregulated in drought tolerant genotype. in plants, lysine is catabolised to glutamic acid and acetyl coa with the help of two enzymes viz. lysine ketoglutarate reductase and saccharopine dehydrogenase, whose gene expression was also involved in response to aba and drought stress in soybean  <cit> . wrky <dig> is involved in drought stress regulation; this gene was found to be upregulated in tolerant genotype under drought condition. wrky <dig> was reported to be directly associated with drought tolerance through transcriptional regulation of ces8a, an arabidopsis drought tolerant gene  <cit> . drought tolerant genes like myb, zfp, metallothiorenin and others identified in our findings were compared to the list of genes identified and were found matching to the rice database as well  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present investigation report the transcriptome analysis of leaves and characterization of transcripts related to drought stress during the seedling stage in lentil using next generation sequencing approach. a total of  <dig>  transcripts were expressed under drought stress and control conditions. these transcripts were successfully annotated by mapping them to kegg pathway databases. qrt-pcr was used to validate the expression levels of  <dig> selected transcripts. the results show a close relationship between qrt-pcr and transcriptome data under drought stress conditions. furthermore, ssrs , snps  and indels  were identified successfully which can be further developed and serve as new resources for future genetic and functional genomics studies for drought tolerance in lentil. above findings match with the phenotypic characterization of both the genotypes under drought stress, which exhibited higher relative water content, membrane stability index, proline, glycine betaine and enzyme activities and lower tbras contents in pdl- <dig> under drought stress compared to sensitive line jl- <dig>  this is the first transcriptomic study on the response of lentil to drought stress at seedling stage.
