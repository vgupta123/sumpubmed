BACKGROUND
understanding the hereditary components underlying trait variation in natural populations is key to answering a range of fundamental questions in evolutionary biology, but advancing basic insight into evolutionary relevant genotype-phenotype interactions is not trivial. two essentials of this endeavor are quantification of phenotypic variation in traits that influence individual fitness in natural settings  <cit>  and collection of information on dna sequences, linkage maps, gene expression profiles or other genomic resources spanning the genome of the focal organism [eg.  <cit> . the recent progress in data collection in evolutionary genetics research, mediated predominantly by advancements in dna sequencing, allows one to rapidly generate vast amounts of genomic data at reasonable cost, even for organisms that are genetically poorly known  <cit> . these advances facilitate detailed analyses of dna sequence evolution in almost any species of interest, whether to scan for signs of positive selection, characterize genome-wide divergence between lineages or identify associations between genomic regions and phenotypic traits . consequently, the main limiting factor for developing model systems for evolutionary genomics is acquisition not of genomic resources but rather of sufficient evolutionarily relevant phenotypic and fitness data. the implications of this trend are that taxa for which long-term ecological data have already been collected  will be at the forefront of evolutionary genomics research on natural populations  <cit> .

a long-term model species for studying sexual selection and host-pathogen interactions in the wild is the house finch   <cit> . the species is native to western north america  <cit> , but shipping of native birds from the western us to pet traders in the east resulted in the establishment of a feral house finch population in the new york city area around  <dig>  <cit> . over the subsequent decades, this eastern population of house finches expanded its distribution across half of the continent and the population size increased exponentially. the house finch became one of the most common bird species in the eastern us and census estimates suggested a population size in the range of hundreds of millions  <cit> . as a result of a mycoplasma gallisepticum  epizootic, which emerged in the washington d.c. area in  <dig> and subsequently spread rapidly over the eastern range  <cit> , populations of house finches in the eastern us and eastern canada declined by approximately 50% between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . after the initial precipitous decline, the population remained stable and there were indications of increasing mg resistance in eastern populations  <cit> . the unique demographic history of the house finch, distinct and evolutionary important carotenoid-based color variation between males  <cit> , and the selection regime brought about by the mg epizootic have made it a model species for many issues in natural selection, sexual selection, and evolutionary genomics, including morphological evolution in response to regional climate  <cit>  plumage coloration and its role in sexual selection  <cit> , gene expression evolution  <cit> , the genomic effects of founder events  <cit> , and patterns of molecular evolution in candidate genes  <cit> , and across the genome  <cit> . these are merely a handful of examples of the substantial knowledge about phenotypes of relevance to evolutionary biology that is represented in this study system  <cit> .

here we present high coverage spleen transcriptomes from two populations of the house finch, one representing birds from a population in arizona  that has never been exposed to mg and the other representing birds from a population in alabama  that had been exposed to mg for 15 years at the time of collection. so far, genomic comparisons between these two populations have included expression profiling based on macro- and micro-arrays  <cit>  and small-scale, partial candidate gene sequences  <cit>  or anonymous genetic marker data  <cit> . the transcriptome assembly provided here is a novel resource for forthcoming comparative and functional studies within house finches and among birds in general. briefly, we describe our sequencing and assembly procedure and the results that we obtained using the zebra finch as a resource for comparative study of gene expression evolution in avian spleen. we follow up with functional annotation and analysis of genetic differentiation in gene expression between the two focal house finch populations studied here to identify genes exhibiting extensive differentiation between these populations. such differentially expressed genes are candidate genes for mg resistance, and these genes will be important targets for subsequent detailed functional analyses to understand host-pathogen interactions in this system and in general. a preliminary report of this transcriptome , pooled across both populations, helped to clarify long-term patterns of protein-evolution in birds and other amniotes  <cit> . the present study focuses on a transcript set over twice as large  and on expression differentiation between house finch populations and between house finch and zebra finch, the only other passerine bird for which spleen expression data is available.

RESULTS
the illumina hiseq run  generated in total  <dig>  million reads  for the al population and  <dig>  million reads  for the az population. after quality trimming ,  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million reads with paired-end information and  <dig>  and  <dig>  million reads without pairing information  remained for the al and the az populations, respectively .

summary of the transcriptome assembly
quality-trimmed illumina reads  were used to assemble the house finch transcriptome. using trinity, we obtained  <dig>  reconstructed transcripts with a mean size of 827 bp and a median size of 347 bp. the shorter transcripts, which likely contain substantial numbers of non-coding rnas, were filtered out using our size cut-off threshold . using this cutoff on zebra finch transcripts,  <dig> %  of all zebra finch cdnas encode proteins . this high incidence of protein-encoding cdnas indicates that the procedure to filter out non-coding house finch cdnas was likely stringent. when applying this filter to assembled house finch transcripts, we retained  <dig>  transcripts, or 37% of the initial set. we estimated the size of intact open reading frames  for each of these qualified transcripts and discarded those with an orf ≤ 300 bp. this resulted in  <dig>  retained transcripts, which we designate as the unfiltered set. finally, we used blat  <cit>  to align the retained transcripts to coding cdnas in the zebra finch and filtered out transcripts using criteria mentioned in methods, yielding a high-quality transcript set of  <dig>  house finch coding cdnas with orthologs in zebra finch. we define this set as the filtered set and used it as the primary working set for subsequent expression and comparative sequence analyses .

different splenic expression patterns between house finch and zebra finch
we compared the splenic expression profiles in the two house finch populations to each other and to previously published data from the zebra finch  <cit> . a transcript was defined as expressed if it has at least one cpm . among the  <dig>  zebra finch transcripts identified that could be mapped to the ensembl  <dig> zebra finch assembly , a total of  <dig>  transcripts were expressed in at least one tissue and a subset of  <dig>  transcripts were expressed in the zebra finch spleen. the corresponding value for the house finch was  <dig>  .  <dig>  transcripts were expressed in all three groups,  <dig>  were uniquely expressed in zebra finch,  <dig>  were uniquely expressed in house finch, and  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts were uniquely expressed in al and az populations, respectively . different go terms were enriched in different groups ; in general, genes related to protein binding were uniquely expressed in house finch spleen and genes related to oxidase activity were uniquely expressed in zebra finch spleen , whereas genes related to metabolism were uniquely expressed in one or the other of the house finch populations .

novel genes in the house finch
a question of interest was to identify potential novel  protein-coding genes that might have evolved unique functions in the house finch or related lineages. to investigate this, we first used the cpc program  <cit>  to predict the coding potential for each of the transcripts assembled de novo in the house finch. out of the initial  <dig>  reconstructed transcripts,  <dig>   were predicted as coding and these included as many as  <dig>   transcripts that had no identifiable zebra finch ortholog. these  <dig>  transcripts were mapped against all known chicken, anolis and human coding cdnas, and we identified an additional  <dig> transcripts with known chicken orthologs,  <dig> with anolis orthologs and  <dig> with human orthologs. among the remaining  <dig>  transcripts, we identified house finch genes not yet found in birds by first calculating the median coding potential score  and the median size  of the  <dig>  transcripts with an identified ortholog and compared these values to the set of genes with no identified ortholog in any of the other four species. this analysis revealed that  <dig>   of the  <dig>  transcripts were longer and had larger coding potential than the median values of the known coding transcripts. next, we calculated the median expression level of known coding genes  for al and az respectively), and found that  <dig> and  <dig> of the novel transcripts in al and az, respectively, had higher expression than the median. of them,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were highly similar isoforms of transcripts with known orthologs, i.e. false positives generated through the de novo assembly process. excluding these we had  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts of which  <dig> and  <dig> partially overlapped  known zebra finch protein-coding genes. all the transcripts that were identified as potential orthologs in the latter steps had low query length coverage and that is likely the reason why we failed to detect them in the initial blast search. this could possibly be explained by partial duplications of the orthologous genes or substantial differences in splicing isoforms between the two species. the remaining  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts that could not be mapped to cdnas from zebra finch were further aligned to the zebra finch genomic sequence. for certain transcripts that were different splice forms of the same genes, only the longest splicing form was used in the alignment. this resulted in significant alignment scores for  <dig> query transcripts in each population. of these,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were aligned at various length coverage with > =80% sequence similarity and exhibited clear exon-intron structures in zebra finch, implying that these are actually functional genes with incomplete annotation in the zebra finch.  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts  were not aligned at all and these constitute a set of novel genes in the lineage leading to house finch at some point after the split from zebra finch.

expression differences between historically exposed and unexposed house finch populations
we compared the expression profiles of transcripts in the filtered set in the two house finch populations: al  and az . expression levels were estimated using the rsem package  <cit> , and expression differences were assessed using deseq  <cit> . using the topgo package in the bioconductor project frame  <cit>  and applying a false discovery rate  of  <dig>  and a minimum fold change of at least two in either direction for the  <dig>  transcripts with noticeable expression  we found that  <dig>  transcripts were differentially expressed between the house finch populations . a subsequent functional enrichment analysis of the these transcripts showed overrepresentation of a total of  <dig> terms,  <dig> related to biological processes, one related to cellular component and seven related to molecular functions .

mf, molecular function; cc, cellular component. go term is the identification number for the gene ontology term and given is also the annotated, significant and expected number of genes for each term and the uncorrected  and corrected  p-values.

snp frequencies and nucleotide diversity in the house finch transcriptome
using the criteria outlined in materials and methods, we identified a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps in the unfiltered set in the al and az populations, respectively.  <dig>   and  <dig>   snps remained in the filtered data set of  <dig>  house finch coding transcripts with orthologs in zebra finch, and of these,  <dig>  snps were shared between populations . we classified the snps as either non-coding , synonymous  or non-synonymous  and calculated the pn/ps ratio for each transcript for both the unfiltered and the filtered polymorphism datasets. the frequency distributions of pn/ps in the unfiltered and filtered snp data sets are presented in figure  <dig>  the filtered set showed a larger proportion of transcripts with a higher pn/ps . we used the method of watterson  <cit>  to estimate global and transcript specific diversity estimates . the al population had slightly higher diversity estimates  than the az population  although the difference between populations was not statistically significant for either the filtered  or the unfiltered  data sets . comparison of these estimates of diversity with similar estimates from house finches recently made for other sequence-based markers, including cis-regulatory regions of candidate genes for resistance  <cit> , shows that house finch transcript diversity is in the range discovered for other markers .

genetic differentiation between al and az populations
to estimate the degree of population differentiation from our data we calculated the fst statistic. we initially used the  <dig>  snps shared between the al and the az populations. these snps mapped to  <dig>  coding transcripts in the filtered set. among these we selected  <dig>  transcripts that contained at least three snps and calculated fst. we found that most transcripts had a low fst  and only  <dig>  transcripts showed fst – values at least  <dig> standard deviations above the mean value . in this set of  <dig> transcripts with unusually high values of fst, we did not detect any enriched functional go terms.

fixed differences between al and az populations
we identified a set of high-quality private snps and potential fixed differences by applying a series of strict filters. using samtools, we first identified snps with non-reference allele fixed in one population and reference allele fixed in the other population and present with a read coverage > <dig> in both populations; variants within 5-bp were discarded to avoid possible false positives due to read misalignment. this resulted in a set of  <dig>  and  <dig>  private variants in the unfiltered set;  <dig>  and  <dig>  of these were classified as non-synonymous polymorphisms.  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the private polymorphisms were retained in the filtered set, and of these,  <dig> and  <dig> were non-synonymous changes present in  <dig> proteins in al and az, respectively . we then looked for cases where at least two fixed non-synonymous differences were present in a single transcript, as this could indicate recent strong directional selection. three of the five genes that possessed multiple fixed differences had ensembl identification numbers in the zebra finch gene set and they are listed in table  <dig>  briefly, the list of genes contained two genes with unknown function, one gene associated to the double-strand break repair mechanism and two genes involved in disease response; a heat-shock associated  and a t-cell precursor  gene .

patterns of alternative splicing
finally, we investigated patterns of alternative splicing in our house finch populations. of the  <dig>  house finch transcripts in the unfiltered set with an orf longer than 300 bp that mapped to zebra finch cdnas,  <dig>  could be retained when requiring a single gene alignment with at least 90% similarity between species and detectable at more than one cpm in either population. altogether, these transcripts encompassed  <dig>  and  <dig>  annotated zebra finch cdnas in the al and az populations, respectively. the median number of splicing forms in these cdnas was two in both the al and the az population, and there were  <dig>   and  <dig>   cdnas with only one splice variant in the al and az population, respectively.  <dig>   and  <dig>   cdnas had two or more splice variants; with a range of 2- <dig>  and 2- <dig>  variants . of all variants called,  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts were uniquely found in the al and the az population, i.e., with more than one cpm in one population and no detectable expression in the other population, respectively .

discussion
transcriptomes are a valuable genomic resource for species of ecological and evolutionary significance because they contain likely targets of natural selection and can provide a catalog of protein-coding regions of interest. transcriptomes are likely enriched for targets of natural and sexual selection not only because the genes themselves may harbor mutations influencing relevant phenotypes but also because regulatory sequences are enriched in the vicinity of coding regions  <cit> ; hence any signals of selection on a regulatory mutation or associations with phenotypic variation may be detectable in genetic variants in nearby coding regions. here we report a draft spleen transcriptome assembly of the house finch, a species of importance for sexual selection and host-pathogen interactions in the wild  <cit> . besides being one of the first non-normalized rna sequencing efforts available for non-model avian taxa  <cit> , our transcriptome is an important resource for comparative genomics studies within birds  <cit>  and for detailed analyses of the genetic basis of pathogen resistance in this particular system. because we sampled only two populations, our sampling design does not allow us to distinguish many interlocking events that could shape patterns of expression and polymorphism in these birds, including the introduction and adaptation to a novel environment in the eastern us and the effect of the mg epizootic on levels of polymorphism. still, after stringent quality filtering using information from zebra finch and chicken, the best-annotated avian genome assemblies, we can state that the core set of transcribed house finch sequences comprises almost  <dig>  unique genes. this set of genes is an invaluable resource for forthcoming efforts aimed at pinpointing the genetic basis of evolutionarily important traits in the house finch, such as resistance to mycoplasma gallisepticum <cit>  and the intensity of plumage redness in males  <cit> .

expression differences between species
when comparing the set of genes expressed in the house finch spleen to a comparable set of genes expressed in the zebra finch spleen  <cit>  we found that only  <dig>  of the total set of  <dig>  genes were expressed in both species. the spleen is a relatively small organ in birds and, although thorough studies of spleen function are uncommon, it plays an obvious role in the universal immune response  <cit> . it was therefore somewhat surprising to find that a large proportion of the entire coding gene set for zebra finches  is expressed in the spleen and that such a large proportion of these genes are uniquely expressed in one species and enriched for different gene ontology terms. by contrast, only  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts were uniquely expressed in one of the two house finch populations studied here. however, most of these genes that were differentially expressed between house finch populations have an average level of expression that is low compared with genes that shared expression between populations . this low level of expression overlap, combined with our small sample sizes per population, means that the probability of failing to detect such genes in one population or the other is high. these factors make the expression differences that we observed between zebra finch and house finch spleen even more striking. in addition to evolutionary divergence in gene expression, undoubtedly many of the differences found between zebra finch and house finch spleen are attributable to overall methodology and the physiological state of the individual birds used for rna-seq.

novel genes in the house finch transcriptome
of particular value to the community of researchers studying house finches is the establishment of a catalog of transcripts and genes, including those that are not previously characterized in other organisms. therefore, we attempted to identify transcripts with high coding potential that had not yet been found in birds. by using a strict set of filters and information about coding potential and reading frames from zebra finch, we identified  <dig> genes that were uniquely present in the house finch transcriptome data set compared to other birds. these genes might be genes that evolved novel function in the house finch lineage after divergence from the zebra finch around  <dig> million years ago  <cit>  or they may represent ancestral genes that lost function in chicken and zebra finch and rapidly accumulated mutations so that they no longer can be identified as potential homologs in standard reciprocal blast analyses. this set of novel genes lacking orthologs in zebra finch or chicken should be primary targets in subsequent analyses aimed at characterizing the genetic basis of novel functions in the lineage leading to the house finch. increased taxon sampling, which presumably will find these genes in additional relatives of house finches, will increase the power of our inferences about novel genes and their functions.

expression differences between populations
in addition to the small set of genes uniquely expressed in one of the two populations , we also found significant expression-level differences for a set of genes when comparing the historically exposed  and unexposed  population of house finches. using a strict filtering pipeline we collected a high-quality set of  <dig>  genes with cpm > <dig>   <dig>  of which were significantly differentially expressed between house finch populations. this gene set was enriched for genes related to metabolic processes, vitamin binding, transferase- and catalytic activity. because the sampling was not designed to make explicit conclusions about globally different patterns of gene expression in the spleen between these two populations - for example by keeping all birds in a common environment for a considerable time period before sampling – the overrepresentation of metabolic processes likely partly reflects differences in the home environment for the different populations. differential expression of metabolic genes could, for example, be in part due to a difference in ambient temperature at the time of sampling in arizona as compared to alabama  <cit> . it should also be stressed that biological replicates and/or validation of gene expression differences with alternative methods will be needed to verify differential expression patterns between the house finch populations.

genetic variation and rates of non-synonymous substitution
using a series of stringent filtering criteria we identified a set of high-quality snps in the transcriptome sequence of the house finch, allowing us to estimate the snp density for the transcribed part of the genome and to assess within- and between-population genetic variation. overall, we identified roughly  <dig>  high-quality snps in each of the populations. the average snp density was hence very similar between populations; in fact, although not significant  after correcting for the number of expressed nucleotides , the number of snps discovered in the recently founded al population  was slightly higher than in the native az population . this pattern is consistent with the idea that neither the artificial introduction of house finches into eastern north america nor the mycoplasma epizootic has dramatically reduced levels of heterozygosity in coding regions in the eastern population. population genetic considerations suggest that the estimates for each population are unlikely to be strongly affected by our relatively small sample size , which is large enough to capture most variation  <cit> , especially given that these populations are not strongly structured  <cit> . sample sizes are also unlikely to explain the pattern because our estimates of genetic diversity were if anything slightly larger for the eastern than for the western us, and the error in these estimates is influenced much more so by the number of loci than the number of individuals. the putative bottleneck in the eastern house finch population was short and the population has been rapidly growing for the last 60 years, perhaps resulting in lower levels of drift and a higher incidence of polymorphisms, albeit at low frequency. additionally, although the selection event as a result of the mycoplasma epizootic may not have been strong, resulting in a negligible effect on levels of polymorphism, any explanation must also reconcile the fact that several surveys of genetic variation in pre- and post- epizootic finches have found significantly lower levels of variation in the east than in the west. such studies include analyses of mitochondrial dna, microsatellites and mhc genes  <cit> . aside from the mtdna and mhc results, which are likely to be idiosyncratic due to issues of linkage, ploidy and balancing selection, the contrasting patterns in these studies and our results suggest that the differences may lie largely in differences in evolutionary dynamics of coding versus noncoding  loci  <cit> . hawley et al. <cit>  found for example increased diversity in mhc class ii genes in post-epizootic birds from eastern united states, potentially reflecting disease mediated balancing selection.

we observed that only 40% of the snps were shared between populations. given the short divergence time and the high level of heterozygosity in the introduced population, the fraction of shared polymorphisms is expected to be high; hence, the lower-than-expected level of shared polymorphism observed here is likely a result of relatively small sample sizes from each range resulting in that many, especially low-frequency, polymorphisms that are indeed segregating in both populations are detected in only one of the populations. as a complementary test to assess if the introduced al population might have been affected by either the demographic history or the mycoplasma epizootic , we looked at the pn/ps ratios calculated for each population separately using both the unfiltered and the filtered set of snps. the underlying hypothesis was that the historically exposed and potentially bottlenecked al population should show a higher ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphisms as a consequence of less efficient selection against slightly deleterious non-synonymous alleles drifting to higher frequency and hence more easily detectable in our sample. in neither of the two data sets did we observe a difference in pn/ps between the native az population and the introduced al population, again suggesting that neither the introduction itself nor the exposure to the epizootic have considerably affected the drift of functional polymorphisms in the introduced al population.

genetic differentiation between populations
as expected given the extremely short time of divergence separating the two house finch populations, the vast majority of genes showed no substantial genetic differentiation between az and al. however, a few genes  showed considerable allele frequency differences reflected in fst values >  <dig> standard deviations higher than the arithmetic mean and these could potentially constitute targets for directional selection in the disease exposed al population . this set of highly differentiated genes was, however, not enriched for any particular functional category. there were five genes in which two or more non-synonymous snps were fixed between the house finch populations, of which  <dig> have unknown functions in birds, one is associated with double-strand break repair and two were associated with immune response. the latter two were a heat-shock protein and a t-cell precursor which corresponds well with the assumed strong selection for the immune response to adapt to the encounter of the novel pathogen mg  <cit> . it should, however, be noted that inference of differentiation from pooled rna samples might be biased by instances of allele-specific expression and verification experiments are needed to establish candidate genes detected from differentiation scans of this type.

alternative splicing
functional polymorphisms may involve primary gene and protein sequences or regulatory changes that affect the expression  <cit>  and recently it has been recognized that, in addition, traits can be controlled via alternative splicing, spatial or temporal variation in the use of different gene transcripts  <cit> , a process that considerably increases gene product complexity  <cit> . recent analyses suggest that most eukaryotic genes have at least two splice variants  <cit> . alternative splicing seems to be more common in higher eukaryotes  <cit>  but results are not consistent and few taxonomic groups have been thoroughly investigated  <cit> . in order to assess the prevalence of alternative splice variation in the house finch spleen transcriptome we focused on a set of genes with a > 300 bp long uninterrupted orf and reciprocal blast-supported 1: <dig> orthology to zebra finch genes , resulting in a gene set of  <dig>  and  <dig>  annotated zebra finch genes in the al and the az populations, respectively. more than half of these showed evidence of only one splice variant in both populations and the remaining genes varied between two to  <dig> splice isoforms. this observation is within the range of splice variation described from other vertebrates. however, it should be noted that splice variant detection using software designed for assembly may misestimate the number of isoforms  <cit>  and additional biases might be introduced by transcript redundancy among compared datasets  <cit> . evolutionarily novel splice variants may constitute an important source for evolution of novel functions because they might be under relatively low constraints  <cit> ; for example, species-specific splice variants are positively correlated with non-synonymous substitution rate  <cit>  and minor alternative exons evolve faster than obligate exons  <cit> . our analysis revealed more than  <dig> unique splice variants across both populations. a conservative interpretation is that rather than reflecting divergence in inter-population splice variation, this result may reveal the challenges with reliably inferring splice variation in previously uncharacterized genomes using short-read data  <cit> . in order to more rigorously assess the patterns of splice variation among populations, we therefore suggest that future transcriptomes in house finches should be conducted with technologies with longer read lengths, a feature that will be increasingly feasible given the rapid developments in sequencing technology  <cit> . still, it is intriguing to speculate on the evolutionary significance of alternative splicing in this system. in the first study of differential gene expression between experimentally infected and uninfected house finches  <cit> , one of the most highly up-regulated genes as a result of infection was an alternative splicing factor, now called srek <dig> , whose function is to regulate alternative splicing. it is fascinating to speculate that this protein might marshal an array of functionally relevant alternatively spliced variants upon mg infection, the results of which we may be detecting in our study. in general we suspect that splice variants could be of interest for forthcoming studies on microevolutionary change in house finches and other birds.

CONCLUSIONS
the characterization of the spleen transcriptome of the house finch will facilitate forthcoming genomic efforts in this species. by using snps in a large set of genes, association analyses and qtl mapping efforts can provide insight into the short-term evolutionary processes governing allele frequency changes as a consequence of putative bottlenecks, disease exposure and/or sexual selection. in addition, this resource will enhance the power of comparative genomics approaches to identify genes of importance for lineage specific adaptations and to investigate molecular evolutionary patterns across diverging lineages. in summary, this resource has paved the way to take a model species for host pathogen interactions and sexual selection into the realm of genomics.
