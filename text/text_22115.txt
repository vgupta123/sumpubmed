BACKGROUND
apoptosis is a genetically programmed form of cell death employed to regulate cell number, spatial organisation and remove infected and damaged cell populations that may compromise the integrity of the organism  <cit> . aberrant or unscheduled apoptotic responses are thought to contribute to various diseases including alzheimer's disease, rheumatic diseases and neoplastic growth  <cit> . induction of apoptosis in virally infected cells is a key weapon in the immune system's arsenal against viral attack.

many viruses have evolved multiple strategies to counteract host-mediated apoptosis in order to facilitate infection, replication or persistence  <cit> . epstein-barr virus  a human γ-herpesvirus that latently infects the majority of adults, was the first virus shown to influence the survival of infected cells  <cit> . in vivo, ebv is associated with a number of benign and malignant proliferative diseases, such as infectious mononucleosis, burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma  <cit> . latent infection of b cells in vitro leads to outgrowth of apoptosis resistant lymphoblastoid cell lines , which phenotypically resemble activated b-cells. although b cells can produce progeny virus, epithelial cells are also known to be permissive for viral replication. studies have shown that ebv has at least two mechanisms of suppressing apoptosis. during latent infection latent membrane protein  <dig>  is the key mediator of protection. lmp <dig>  a cd <dig> mimic, up-regulates cellular bcl- <dig>  <cit>  and a <dig>  <cit>  via the nfκb pathway. the virus also encodes two structural homologues of bcl-2: bhrf <dig>  <cit>  and the less well characterised and more controversial balf <dig>  <cit>  which are thought to play their major roles during lytic infection. whilst many other viruses also have bcl- <dig> homologues   <cit> , ebv and its mammalian analogues appear unique in having two v-bcl-2s.

despite being considered dispensable for ebv replication or cellular transformation in vitro  <cit> , bhrf <dig> is extremely highly conserved in distinct geographical isolates of ebv  <cit> , and its role in vivo remains unclear. bhrf <dig> is thought to act in lytic cycle to delay apoptosis during replication in terminally differentiating epithelium  <cit> . however, some ebv-positive b-cell lymphomas have been found to be positive for bhrf <dig> transcripts  <cit>  and latent bhrf <dig> transcripts have been detected in t-cell lymphomas  <cit>  and in ebv-transformed tightly latent b-cell lines in vitro  <cit> . additionally, ebv bhrf <dig> has been shown to suppress apoptosis in lymphoid cells in response to a range of triggers including serum deprivation  <cit> , dna damaging agents and chemotherapeutic drugs  <cit>  and cytokines  <cit> . it is possible then, that bhrf <dig> may play a role at some stage during latent infection, which warrants the study of this protein in b cells, the target for latent infection.

analogues of ebv are found in the higher primate species. herpesvirus papio  and herpesvirus pan  infect baboons and chimpanzees respectively. h. papio encodes a bhrf <dig> homologue that shares 65% amino acid identity  with ebv bhrf <dig>  whilst the h. pan bhrf <dig> is even more similar at 82% identity and 90% similarity  <cit> . h. papio bhrf <dig> has been shown to confer resistance to cisplatin induced apoptosis in human keratinocytes akin to ebv bhrf <dig>  <cit> , but this study represents the first functional analysis of a primate virus bhrf <dig> in a lymphoid cell background. here we show that h. pan bhrf <dig> exhibits similar anti-apoptotic activity to that of ebv bhrf <dig> in the human burkitt's lymphoma cell line ramos-bl in response to apoptosis induced by either serum withdrawal, etoposide treatment and the previously untested trigger, ultraviolet radiation. these results show that h. pan bhrf <dig> is biologically active in human b-lymphocytes in vitro suggesting a conserved role for bhrf <dig> during in vivo infection of b-lymphocytes.

RESULTS
construction of bhrf <dig> expression vectors and selection of positive clones
as the senior author has previously shown that ebv bhrf <dig> suppresses apoptosis in response to serum reduction in various bl cell lines  <cit> , we initially elected to compare the abilities of h. pan bhrf <dig> and ebv bhrf <dig> to regulate serum reduction induced apoptosis in the ebv negative ramos-bl cell line to ascertain whether the genes are functional, as well as structural, homologues. in order to produce expression vectors, the h. pan and ebv bhrf <dig> reading frames were amplified by pcr from template vectors phvpantw <dig> and pdh <dig> respectively using primers incorporating xhoi restriction sites. the pcr fragments were introduced into the pcr <dig> topo® vector and the xhoi fragment was released by restriction digestion of the topobhrf <dig> constructs and cloned into the xhoi restriction site of the pcdna4/hismax mammalian expression vector , which produces an n-terminal fusion protein with 6his and xpress epitopes.

ramos-bl cells were electroporated with either control vector, ebv bhrf <dig> or h. pan bhrf <dig> and cloned by limiting dilution in medium containing  <dig> μg/ml zeocin. there was no obvious difference in the numbers of drug resistant clones that were produced by transfection with the vector or either of the bhrf <dig> constructs. drug resistant clones were screened by rt-pcr for bhrf <dig> expression and approximately 50% of the clones were shown to be expressing detectable bhrf <dig>  the rt-pcr profiles of two clones each of the three transfected populations which were selected for further analysis, are shown in figure  <dig>  rt negative samples were included  to rule out dna contamination of rna samples. expression of the fusion proteins was confirmed by western blot analysis  and by indirect immunofluorescence using an antibody directed against the 6his epitope . some diffuse fluorescence is seen in the his c controls , but this is to be expected as the fusion part of the protein is at the amino terminus and the vector therefore can produce a small protein containing the 6his epitope. there is a distinctive crescent-like pattern of fluorescence in clones transfected with the ebv bhrf <dig>  and h. pan bhrf <dig> , indicative of bhrf <dig> expression.

determination of sensitivity to serum withdrawal induced apoptosis
to determine the sensitivity of the transfected clones to the induction of apoptosis by serum reduction, ebv clones ebv 1b and ebv 3b, h. pan clones pan  <dig> and pan  <dig> and bhrf <dig> null vector control clones his c <dig> and his c <dig> were seeded in medium containing either 10% or  <dig> % serum and the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined at 24-hourly intervals, using acridine orange to distinguish between apoptotic and viable cell nuclei. necrotic nuclei that appeared after several days due to secondary necrosis of cells already lost by apoptosis were excluded from the counts. apoptotic death was also confirmed by dna laddering . we found that when maintained in medium containing 10% serum , both the ebv bhrf <dig> clones exhibited a slight drop in viability after  <dig> hours and thereafter viabilities increased to above 90%. a similar drop in viability was seen in the two vector clones, but after an increase at  <dig> hours, both clones began to show a decline in viability by  <dig> hours. both the h. pan bhrf <dig> expressing clones, maintained viability above 90% throughout the  <dig> hours period. in contrast, the bhrf <dig> null vector controls showed higher rates of cell death compared to either the ebv or h. pan bhrf <dig> expressing clones from  <dig> hours onwards in medium containing  <dig>  % serum . after  <dig> hours in culture, approximately 15% viability was observable in the bhrf <dig> null vector controls whilst the viability of the bhrf <dig> clones ranges from  <dig> to 49%. clone ebv ib was the most resistant to apoptosis induced by serum deprivation with 49% viability after  <dig> hours. two-way anova and tukey's pairwise analysis of arcsine transformed data showed that at all time points from  <dig> hours onwards there were significant differences  between the bhrf <dig> expressing clones and the vector control clones, but not between the pan and ebv bhrf <dig> clones, except at  <dig> hours when clone ebv 1b showed significantly higher viability than all other clones . therefore our data indicates that  <dig> % serum is sub-optimal for survival of ramos-bl since a high degree of apoptotic cells are observable at this concentration. clearly however, both ebv and h. pan bhrf <dig> expression were able to delay the apoptotic response, and thus promote the survival of these cells which would otherwise undergo apoptosis.

determination of sensitivity to etoposide induced apoptosis
we then investigated whether or not the proteins could regulate apoptosis induced by the dna damaging agent etoposide. the transfected clones were seeded in medium containing either no etoposide or  <dig> ng/ml etoposide. the percentage of viable versus apoptotic cells was determined every  <dig> hours by acridine orange fluorescence. we found that, in the absence of etoposide, viability was maintained at above 90% in all clones . in the presence of etoposide , both the control clones showed a steady decline in viability from  <dig> hours onwards, with clone his c <dig> maintaining higher viability than his c <dig>  whilst the bhrf <dig> clones remained viable for  <dig> hours before starting to show a decline in viability. two way anova and tukey's pairwise comparisons of arcsine transformed data showed that the differences between the control and bhrf <dig> clones were significantly different from  <dig> hours onwards. whilst clone his c <dig> was significantly different to the bhrf <dig> clones at all time points, it was also significantly different to his c <dig> at the  <dig>  and  <dig>  hour time points. there were no significant differences between the ebv and pan bhrf <dig> clones.

determination of sensitivity to ultraviolet induced apoptosis
ultraviolet radiation has been shown to induce apoptosis in other cell lines within a  <dig> hour period. having first determined the uv conditions necessary to induced apoptosis in the parent cell line, we then exposed the transfected clones to uv radiation at  <dig> jm- <dig>  acridine orange counts were taken after  <dig> hours and the results are shown in figure  <dig>  statistical analysis was performed on both the transformed and untransformed data. the untransformed data is shown in figure  <dig>  as the error bars were so small in the transformed data that they were not visible. the results are highly significant with p <  <dig> .

mapping the amino acid changes on to the 3d structure
during the course of this study, the structure of bhrf <dig> was solved  <cit> . using rasmol, v <dig> , the freely available molecular visualisation software created by roger sayle, we have produced a 3d image of bhrf <dig>  highlighting the regions where the ebv and h. pan proteins differ, as shown in figure 6a. non-conservative changes, shown in yellow, tend to be found at the end of helices, whereas conservative replacements tend to be within the helices. there are changes within the known functional bh domains . the aligned primary amino acid sequences, with the bh domains and changes highlighted using the same colour scheme are shown in figure 6b.

discussion
in this study we present evidence that the bhrf <dig> protein encoded by h. pan is functionally homologous to the analogous protein in the ebv in human b cells. bhrf <dig> is one of two bcl- <dig> homologues encoded by ebv. previously the ebv bhrf <dig> protein has been shown to protect transfected b-cells from apoptosis  <cit>  and delay the differentiation of epithelial cells in vitro  <cit> . the primate virus analogues of bhrf <dig> have now been cloned by us and others  <cit>  and have been shown to be highly homologous in their primary structure both at the dna and protein level. bhrf <dig> is normally expressed at high levels in during lytic replication in epithelial cells and the first functional studies of a primate bhrf <dig>  namely the baboon virus bhrf <dig>  were carried out in a keratinocyte system. whilst a role for bhrf <dig> during latent infection has not been proven, circumstantial evidence that bhrf <dig> transcripts are found in certain lymphoid malignancies and that bhrf <dig> can suppress apoptosis in lymphoid cells suggests that bhrf <dig> has the potential to contribute to malignant transformation. whilst infection of b cells is largely latent, lytic replication in b cells also plays an important role in ebv's lifecycle by providing virus to re-infect epithelial cells, ensuring the continued shedding of virus in the oropharynx. we therefore decided to investigate whether the functional homology extended to a lymphoid cell background by comparing ebv bhrf <dig> with the previously uncharacterised bhrf <dig> from h. pan. we used  <dig> triggers known to induce apoptosis at differing rates. serum withdrawal is a slow trigger, with low levels of apoptosis for  <dig> hours followed by a precipitous drop in viability. the kinetics of etoposide activity are very different with a steady decline in viabilty over the  <dig> day period, whilst uv irradiation  induces apoptosis within hours. the ebv and h. pan bhrf1s afforded significant protection against the induction of apoptosis by all three triggers, compared to the vector controls. there was no statistical difference between the ebv and h. pan bhrf1s, , suggesting that h. pan bhrf <dig> is indeed a true functional homologue of ebv bhrf <dig>  the difference between clone ebv1b and the other bhrf <dig> clones at  <dig> hours in low serum could possibly be attributed to slightly higher levels of bhrf- <dig> expression in this clone, although it is difficult to quantify absolute expression levels from the fluorescence images shown in figure  <dig>  clone his c <dig> maintained higher viability than clone his c <dig> against all three triggers and when exposed to etoposide this is statistically significant from  <dig> hours onwards. this possibly reflects genetic changes accumulated by the clones during selection and passage and highlights the importance of including more than one clone in assays such as these.

when one looks more closely at the regions of the protein that differ between the human and chimpanzee viruses , it is perhaps not surprising that the two proteins are functional homologues, despite the changes in the amino acid sequence. the non-conservative changes are almost always at the end of a helix where they are least likely to disrupt the overall structure of the protein, whilst the conservative changes are mainly within the helices or loops. notably there are some changes within the bh domains, known to be critical for the function of bcl- <dig> family proteins, which are clearly tolerated in terms of conservation of function. none of the observed changes are likely to significantly alter the conformation of the protein, highlighting the fact that functional conservation of bhrf <dig> is subject to 3d structural constraints. these observations emphasise the importance of combining structural information with homology studies such as this one to identify regions of the protein that need to be conserved to retain structural integrity. that the two proteins appear to be so similar at the 3d level implies they probably interact with cellular proteins that are themselves highly conserved in the two species. there are only a few reports of proteins known to interact with bhrf <dig>  including pra <dig>  <cit>  and although some studies have shown interactions with several bcl- <dig> family proteins  <cit> , the reported differences in the 3d structures of bhrf <dig> and bcl- <dig>   <cit>  suggests that the anti-apoptotic activity of bhrf <dig> does not exactly parallel that of bcl- <dig>  this warrants further study into the viral and cellular proteins which interact with bhrf <dig>  not only to yield more insight into the interplay between virus and host, but also to further our knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of apoptosis.

CONCLUSIONS
our results are the first demonstration of functional homology between a primate bhrf <dig>  and ebv bhrf <dig> in a human lymphoid cell background. both proteins protect against apoptosis induced by two previously described triggers and also a new trigger, uv radiation, against which bhrf <dig> has never been reported to provide protection. comparison of the ebv and h. pan proteins at the 3d structural level reveals that none of the changes is likely to significantly alter the structure of the protein.
