BACKGROUND
inorganic polyphosphate  is a chain of few or many hundreds of phosphate  residues linked by high-energy phosphoanhydride  <cit> . polyp has attracted considerable attention as a gras  food additive by fda with antimicrobial properties that can prevent spoilage of food  <cit> , <cit> . polyp inhibits the growth of various gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus <cit> - <cit> , listeria monocytogenes <cit> , <cit> , sarcina lutea <cit> , bacillus cereus <cit> , and mutans streptococci  <cit> , <cit> , and of fungi such as aspergillus flavus <cit> . the ability of polyp to chelate divalent cations is regarded as relevant to the antibacterial effects, contributing to cell division inhibition and loss of cell-wall integrity  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . on the other hand, large numbers of gram-negative bacteria including escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium are capable of growing in higher concentrations, even up to 10% of polyp  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> .

periodontal disease is caused by bacterial infection which is associated with gram-negative oral anaerobes. in our previous study  <cit> , polyp  with different linear phosphorus  chain lengths  demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against porphyromonas gingivalis, a black pigmented, gram-negative periodontopathogen. polyp also showed antibacterial activity against other black-pigmented, gram-negative oral anaerobes such as prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas endodontalis <cit> , <cit> . however, the antimicrobial mechanism of polyp against gram-negative bacteria has not yet been fully understood. in the past decade, global genome-wide studies of changes in expression patterns in response to existing and new antimicrobial agents have provided us with a deeper understanding of antimicrobial action  <cit> . in the present study, we performed the full-genome gene expression microarrays of p. gingivalis, and gene ontology  and protein-protein interaction network analysis of the differentially expressed genes were also performed for elucidating the mechanism of antibacterial action of polyp.

RESULTS
the complete list of the average gene expression values has been deposited in ncbi’s gene expression omnibus   and is accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig>  using filtering criteria of a  <dig>  or greater fold-change in expression and significance p-values of < <dig> ,  <dig> out of  <dig>  genes in p. gingivalis w <dig> were differentially expressed by polyp <dig> treatment. the expression of  <dig> transcripts was increased by polyp treatment while  <dig> showed decreased expression . to validate the microarray results, quantitative rt-pcr  of selected genes was performed. five of the genes were selected from the up-regulated group and the other five from the down-regulated group in the polyp-treated p. gingivalis cells. we used 16s rrna as a reference gene for normalization of the qrt-pcr data. there was a high correlation between the expression ratios determined by the microarray and the qrt-pcr  .

to broadly characterize the differentially expressed gene  set, go category enrichment analysis was performed. this analysis identified distinct biological themes associated with each group of the up-regulated and the down-regulated genes. the down-regulated genes were associated with go terms related to metabolic process , pyridine nucleotide biosynthetic process , regulation of cell shape , and polysaccharide biosynthetic process . the up-regulated genes were associated with go terms related to cellular iron ion homeostasis , ribosome , transposase activity , and dna binding .

using  <dig> degs belonging to the above biological themes, we generated the protein-protein interaction network based on a database of known and predicted protein interactions. the network analysis identified  <dig> degs that have direct interaction with one another , and  <dig> biological meaningful clusters related to 1) iron/hemin acquisition, 2) energy metabolism and electron carriers, 3) cell envelope and cell division, 4) ribosome, and 5) transposon functions.

hemin acquisition and energy metabolism
in prokaryotic cells, respiration occurs in the cell membrane in which electrons are transferred sequentially through lipoquinones  and a series of membrane-bound protein carriers such as cytochrome bc <dig> complex, although the exact organization of enzymes in the respiratory chains varies among different bacteria  <cit> . p. gingivalis requires hemin as an iron source for its growth  <cit> . the redox potential of hemin , required as a prosthetic group of cytochrome b, allows it to mediate electron transport with generation of cellular energy  <cit> , <cit> .

among  <dig> genes of hmu locus  encoding hmu yrstuv, which play a major role in hemin acquisition  <cit> , five genes, but not hmuy, exhibited more than 2-fold decrease in the expression in the presence of polyp <dig> . in addition, genes related to metabolic process including energy metabolism and biosynthesis of lipoquinones, which occupy a central and essential role in electron transport  <cit> , were significantly down-regulated by polyp . genes related to biosynthesis of pyridine nucleotides, known as soluble electron carriers, were also down-regulated . these results are compatible with our previous study in which the amount of hemin accumulated on the p. gingivalis surface increased while energy-driven uptake of hemin by the bacterium decreased in the presence of polyp <dig>  <cit> . it is conceivable that polyp induce hemin deficiency in p. gingivalis, resulting in disruption of the electron transport occurring in the bacterial membrane. notably, the up-regulation of oxidative stress response was observed under hemin-limited conditions  <cit> . hence, the up-regulation of a series of genes involved in oxidative stress, i.e., 4fe-4s ferredoxin, rubrerythrin, thioredoxin, fe-mn superoxide dismutase, thiol peroxidase, dps family protein, rpry, ferritin, and htra , may be due to hemin limitation induced by polyp. however, it is also possible that excessive accumulation of hemin in the vicinity of the bacterial cell surface without formation of μ-oxo bisheme by the bacterium may cause oxidative stress on p. gingivalis <cit> , as the formation of μ-oxo bisheme protects from hemin-mediated cell damage  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> .

cell envelope and cell division
among genes involved in biosynthesis and degradation of surface polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides,  <dig> genes were repressed and  <dig> genes increased by polyp. among genes related to biosynthesis and degradation of murein sacculus and peptidoglycan,  <dig> genes were down-regulated . for most bacteria, the peptidoglycan cell wall is both necessary and sufficient to determine cell shape  <cit> . in p. gingivalis w <dig> genome there is a group of genes called division/cell wall  cluster, which are involved in cell division and synthesis of peptidoglycan  <cit> - <cit> : pg <dig> , pg <dig> , pg <dig> , pg <dig> , pg <dig> , pg <dig> , pg <dig> , pg <dig> , pg <dig> , and pg <dig> . among these, mray, murd, ftsw, murg, murc, and ftsq  were down-regulated by polyp <dig>  it seems that the reduced expression of the genes related to cell envelope biosynthesis in polyp-exposed p. gingivalis may be a result from disruption of the electron transport and reduced production of atp, since atp is fundamental for many metabolic processes in bacteria including cell wall biosynthesis and protein synthesis  <cit> . these transcriptional changes are partially in agreement with the previous report using bacillus cereus in which polyp inhibited the bacterial cell division  <cit> . however, unlike b. cereus, formation of elongated aseptate cells and growth phase-dependent bacteriolysis were not observed in p. gingivalis exposed to polyp  <cit> . it was proposed that polyp, because of its metal ion-chelating nature, may affect the ubiquitous bacterial cell division protein ftsz, whose gtpase activity is known to be strictly dependent on divalent metal ions. then, polyp may consequently block the dynamic formation  of the z ring, which would explain the aseptate phenotype of b. cereus <cit> . b. cereus exposed to polyp, however, showed normal dna replication, chromosome segregation, and synthesis of the lateral cell wall  <cit> . in the present study, p. gingivalis w <dig> decreased the expression of genes in relation to biosynthesis of cell wall, purine, pyrimidine, nucleoside, and nucleotide, and replication of dna in the presence of polyp <dig> . these results probably indicate that polyp affects the overall proliferation process including biosynthesis of nucleic acids, dna replication, biosynthesis of cell wall, and cell division in p. gingivalis.

in several transcriptional profiling studies using gram-positive bacteria, a cell wall stress stimulon that includes genes involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis was induced in the cells challenged with cell wall-active antibiotics  <cit> , <cit> . the bacterial cells appeared to respond to the cell wall-active antibiotics by attempting to raise the rate of peptidoglycan biosynthesis in order to compensate for the damaged and partially missing cell wall  <cit> , <cit> . overall, the results indicate that the mode of action of polyp against p. gingivalis may be different from not only that of the cell wall-active antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria, but also that of polyp against gram-positive bacteria.

ribosomal proteins
in bacteria, production of ribosome requires up to 40% of the cell's energy in rapidly growing bacteria and is therefore tightly regulated on several levels  <cit> . it seems that bacteria with kinetically impaired ribosomes can to some extent increase the number of ribosomes accumulated under poor growth conditions or under antibiotic challenge in order to compensate for their slower function  <cit> , <cit> . it has been reported that antibiotics that target the ribosome or translation factors up-regulate synthesis of ribosomal proteins and accumulate ribosome precursors in streptococcus pneumoniae <cit> . similarly, in clostridium difficile, genes encoding many ribosomal proteins were coordinately up-regulated by antibiotics such as amoxicillin, clindamycin, and metronidazole  <cit> . therefore, it is conceivable that the up-regulation of the genes encoding ribosomal proteins of polyp- exposed p. gingivalis  may reflect a compensatory response for slower or disturbed function of the ribosome.

meanwhile, ribosome biosynthesis of bacteria is governed by transcriptional and translational regulatory mechanisms that provide a balanced and coordinated production of individual ribosomal components  <cit> . it has been suggested that some free ribosomal proteins act as autogenous feedback inhibitors that cause selective translational inhibition of the synthesis of certain ribosomal proteins whose genes are in the same operon as their own. this inhibition is due to the structural homology between certain ribosomal protein binding regions on 16s rrna and the mrna target site for the ribosomal protein  <cit> - <cit> . although autogenous regulation is known to be a general strategy of balancing ribosomal protein synthesis in bacteria  <cit> , mechanisms for controlling ribosomal protein gene expression in p. gingivalis have not yet been characterized. further studies will be needed to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms involved in ribosomal protein synthesis in p. gingivalis.

transposon functions
the majority of the up-regulated genes related to mobile and extrachromosomal element functions were the genes encoding transposases . transposition is generally known to be triggered by cellular stress, i.e., nutritional deficiency, chemicals, and oxidative agents. little is known about the transposition in p. gingivalis, but up-regulation of transposase-related insertion sequence elements was noticed in p. gingivalis w <dig> after treatment with h2o <dig> <cit> . thus, it seems quite reasonable to speculate that induction of transposase is associated with oxidative stress-like response which occurred in p. gingivalis w <dig> due to the presence of polyp.

CONCLUSIONS
we observed that polyp causes numerous events of differential transcription in p. gingivalis. down-regulated genes were related to iron/hemin acquisition, energy metabolism and electron carriers, and cell envelope and cell division. in contrast, up-regulated genes were related to ribosome and transposon functions. polyp probably exerts its antibacterial effect through inhibition of iron/hemin acquisition by the bacterium, resulting in severe perturbation of energy metabolism, cell envelope biosynthesis and cell division, and elevated transposition. although the up-regulation of the genes related to ribosomal proteins may possibly reflect autogenous feedback inhibition to regulate the synthesis of certain ribosomal proteins in metabolically disturbed p. gingivalis by polyp, the exact mechanisms underlying this polyp-induced up-regulation of the genes have yet to be elucidated. the current information obtained from the gene ontology and protein-protein interaction network analysis of the differentially expressed genes determined by microarray will shed new light on the study of the antibacterial mechanism of polyp against other related bacteria belonging to the black-pigmented bacteroides species.
