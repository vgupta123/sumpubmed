BACKGROUND
mammals and insects have adapted evolutionarily to the heterogeneous chemical environments in which they live. odorant receptors  in orns systems are involved in scent detection and discrimination and are therefore key to understanding the molecular evolution of olfactory mechanisms in animals  <cit> .

insect ors are evolutionarily unrelated to their vertebrate counterparts. although insect ors possess seven transmembrane domains like the g-protein-coupled ors in vertebrates, the transmembrane topology is completely inverted  <cit> . since the discovery of the first or in drosophila through bioinformatics analysis of the partially sequenced genome  <cit> , numerous or-coding genes have been identified in various holometabolous insects. in the genomes characterized to date,  <dig> or genes have been found in drosophila  <cit> ,  <dig> in mosquito  <cit> ,  <dig> in honey bee  <cit> , and  <dig> in red floor beetle  <cit> . insect ors evolve rapidly, and there is considerable sequence diversity among or proteins—many show only ~20% similarity  <cit> . the olfactory systems of a variety of insect species have been extensively studied. however, it is still very difficult to draw satisfying conclusions about the evolution of insect olfaction because of the absence of studies on some important taxa, such as orthopteran insects  <cit> .

most insect ors are only expressed in olfactory organs such as antennae or maxillary palps  <cit> . aside from the highly conserved odorant receptor co-receptor  subfamily, the expression of each individual or is confined to a unique subset of orns, resulting in molecular diversity among orns. the “one-receptor-one-neuron” model proposed for mammalian olfactory systems also applies to most insect orns  <cit> . orns expressing the same ors were housed in electrophysiologically identical sensilla subtypes and converged to the same glomerulus in the antennal lobe. extracellular single-unit recordings from individual olfactory sensilla have revealed that different odorants elicit responses from different subsets of orns, and that orns exhibit a remarkable diversity of response properties  <cit> . orns housed in different sensilla types expressed distinct ors, allowing the sensilla to be characterized by their molecular and cellular properties  <cit> .

locust  is regarded as a model animal of hemimetabolous insects, and is a notorious worldwide pest that has historically caused tremendous damage to agricultural production  <cit> . its behaviours, such as feeding, migration, mating, defence, aggregation, and reproduction, are probably mediated by chemoreception. the development of alternative control methods to replace chemical pesticides will depend on understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate locust behaviour.

thus far, we have identified and characterized several locust odorant-binding proteins  and chemosensory proteins  that are thought to be involved in chemoreception in insects  <cit> . recently, the evolutionally conserved orco was identified in locust and found to be ubiquitously expressed in orns, just as in other insects  <cit> . however, extensive efforts to identify functionally specific ors have failed because of the low sequence homology between ors and the large evolutionary distances among insect clades. the absence of knowledge about ors that transduce the binding of odorants into neural activity has hindered further understanding of locust olfaction.

here, we have identified four novel or-coding genes in locust and found that lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig> showed differential expression patterns in olfactory organs. lmigor <dig> was specifically expressed in antennae, whereas lmigor <dig> transcripts could also be detected in mouthparts. some of the orns expressing lmigor <dig> or lmigor <dig> could be found in the basiconic sensilla, but the receptors were present in different sensilla subtypes. these results may offer insights into locust olfaction and contribute to the understanding of the evolution of insect chemoreception.

RESULTS
identification of odorant receptors in locust
a tblastn search of the locust antenna expressed sequence tag  database, using previously identified insect ors as queries, identified  <dig> sequence fragments coding putative ors. full cdna length was obtained using race. iterative blast using the newly identified ors as query sequences identified another two putative ors fragments and their full length was obtained by walking sequencing of the clones. the complete coding sequences were deposited in genbank and designated as lmigor <dig> , lmigor <dig> , lmigor <dig>  and lmigor <dig> . they consisted of amino acids of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the theoretical molecular weights were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kd respectively. sequence identities among them ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % . a pfam search clearly classified them into the seven-transmembrane  superfamily, although tmhmm prediction gave relatively low probabilities for the seventh transmembrane domains, perhaps in part because of ambiguities in the hydrophobic regions. the predicted locations of putative transmembrane domains within the sequences are indicated in figure  <dig>  phylogenetic analysis of several more closely related insect ors confidently grouped lmigors into a monophyletic lineage, indicating they can be as designated as locust-specific ors .

the temporal and spatial expression profile of lmigors
to assess the tissue-specific expression patterns of the ors in locusta migratoria, polymerase chain reaction  experiments were performed using sequence-specific primers that amplified ~700-bp sequences from cdna pools produced from 1 μg of total rna. the lmigor <dig>  lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig> mrna were detected exclusively in locust antennae, whereas the lmigor <dig> transcripts were also abundantly detected in mouthparts. in non-olfactory organs, such as tarsi, wings and guts, we did not detect any specific expression, although numerous gustation-related chemosensilla  were present. we found no differences in tissue distribution between sexes . interestingly, we found that the expression levels of lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig> in the antennae increased with age, especially after the fourth instar stage. in contrast, lmigor <dig> expressed more highly in nymph than in adult. among these genes, only lmigor <dig> could be detected in eggs besides its abundant expression from nymph to adult . the locust actin gene was constitutively expressed at high levels in all tissues at all developmental stages, providing a control for the integrity of the cdna template .

expression of lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig> in orns in olfactory organs
to determine whether the lmigors genes were specifically expressed in orns, we carried out in situ hybridization using gene-specific probes. we found that only a small subset of the antennal cells present in each section of adult antenna was labelled by the lmigor <dig> antisense probe. we found that more than  <dig> labelled cells could be detected in each segment . by contrast, cells labelled by the lmigor <dig> antisense probe were found in both antennae and maxillary palps. the number of cells/segment was about 1– <dig> cells—much less than that for lmigor <dig> . we did not detect any labelled antennal cells expressing lmigor <dig> or lmigor <dig> .

to confirm the neuronal identity of the labelled cells, we performed rna in situ hybridization on consecutive sections using rna probes for lmigor1/ <dig> and lmigorco. the results showed that antennal cells expressing lmigor1/ <dig> located within orns clusters expressing lmigorco , indicating the putative lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig> expressed in orns. this was further verified by two-color in situ hybridization using fluorophore labelled probes . we sometimes observed labelling of, not only the cell body, but also the dendritic like structure , further identifying these labelled cells as orns.

lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig> map to distinct subtypes of the basiconic sensilla
we then carried out an imaging experiment to assign the labelled orns to morphologically specific sensillum types. the results demonstrated that some orns expressing lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig> could be unambiguously attributed to basiconic sensilla . in contrast, we did not observe any neurons labelled with lmigor <dig> or lmigor <dig> probes in trichoid, coeloconic, or chaetic sensilla. no positive signals could be detected when the sense probe was applied . unlike the colocalization pattern seen with lmigorco, lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig> were expressed in discrete subset of orns , indicating they were present in different sensilla subtypes.

discussion
we have identified four putative ors in locusta migratoria, named as lmigor <dig>  lmigor <dig>  lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig> and found that they harboured all the characteristic features of insect ors: seven trans-membrane domains and conserved ser-tyr-ser motif, expression in olfactory organs, and more conserved amino acids at the c terminus than in the n terminal region  <cit> . however, the new ors were highly divergent from known insect ors. this is consistent with the requirement for recognition of a large number of molecularly diverse odorants, and with species-specific expansion of insect or gene subfamily lineages. locust has the special microglomerular systems innervated by branched orns and projection neurons and may not follow the law of one receptor to one glomerulus in insect  <cit> . the complex organization of the olfactory system in locust might increase coding capacity and this was correlated with the complicated behavioural plasticity of the locust. our analysis of the phylogenetic relationships of locust ors with ors from other insects further agreed with the view that orthopteran insects, including the locust, play a special role in the study of olfactory evolution, particularly in invertebrates  <cit> .

orco is generally expressed in insect orns and may serve as a marker for orns  <cit> . our observation that a few antennal cells expressing lmigor <dig> were located within clusters of lmigorco-expressing cells unambiguously defined them as orns. the specific expression of lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig> in olfactory organs indicated that they are involved in olfaction. although both or transcripts could be detected in antennae, their labelling patterns were different. orns expressing individual genes were restricted to distinct subsets of antennal orns. the assignment of the two or genes to different functional types of basiconic sensilla indicate that they have contrasting response profiles. the failure of our attempts to localize the expression of lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig> in antenna using rna in situ hybridization experiments may be partially caused by the high gc content of these ors, which was  <dig> % and 67% respectively.

insects are also equipped with a second nose: the palps. these organs in hawk moth and mosquito serve as detectors for co <dig> <cit> , while in drosophila, they may play a role in taste enhancement  <cit> . locust palps have been shown to play critical roles for locating and evaluating food resources  <cit> . it was therefore not surprising that the expression of lmigor <dig> was detected in mouthparts. however, the most fascinating finding was that lmigor <dig> was expressed in both antenna and palps. ors in drosophila are selectively expressed in only one of these organs  <cit> . in drosophila, orns housed by basiconic sensilla on antennae and maxillary palpi expressed discrete subsets of or genes and projected to distinct regions of the antennal lobe, indicating different functions  <cit> . in locust, the external morphology of the basiconic sensilla on maxillary palpi resembles that on antennae, except for a prominent socket in connection with a membranous cuticle  <cit> . whether the basiconic sensilla on maxillary palpi and antennae have different physiological functions must be experimentally verified. nevertheless, the overlapping expression of lmigor <dig> on antennae and palpi, which resembles the differential expression of some mosquito ors across all three olfactory appendages, reflected a topographic ordering of sensitivity  <cit> .

some odorant binding proteins, such as lush, may serve as triggers that activate ors through conformational change upon odorant binding  <cit> . in locust, the odorant-binding protein lmigobp <dig> was expressed in all basiconic sensilla on antennae and palps  <cit> . its coexpression with lmigors in the same sensilla made it reasonable to guess that these two proteins may interact; this awaits further investigation.

we can only tentatively deduce the functions of lmigors because of their high sequence divergence from known ors. nevertheless, the differential expression of lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig> indicates distinct functions. furthermore, their ubiquitous expression during development and sex-independent expression pattern suggests that these two receptors may be involved in the detection of general odours rather than pheromones. the lmigor <dig> is more likely to be involved in feeding because of its abundant expression in mouthparts  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have for the first time identified four novel or-coding genes in locust, named as lmigor <dig>  lmigor <dig>  lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig>  their encoded proteins consist of amino acids of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 403; and their theoretical molecular weights were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kd respectively. sequence identities among them ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. our analysis of the phylogenetic relationships of locust ors with ors from other insects further agreed with the view that orthopteran insects, including the locust, play a special role in the study of olfactory evolution, particularly in invertebrates. they all specifically express in olfaction related organs, antenna or mouthparts in locust. lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig> showed differential expression patterns in olfactory organs. lmigor <dig> was specifically expressed in antennae, whereas lmigor <dig> transcripts could also be detected in mouthparts. some of the orns expressing lmigor <dig> or lmigor <dig> could be found in the basiconic sensilla, but the receptors were present in different sensilla subtypes. these results may offer insights into locust olfaction and contribute to the understanding of the evolution of insect chemoreception.
