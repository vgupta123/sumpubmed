BACKGROUND
in annual grasses, monocarpic senescence is the final stage of a plant’s development during which vegetative tissues are degraded and their cellular nutrients and amino acids are transported to the developing grain. the regulation of this process is crucial for the plant’s reproductive success and determines to a large extent the nutritional quality of the harvested grain. among wild diploid relatives of wheat, there exists large variation in zn and fe grain content, whereas modern wheat germplasm collections exhibit comparatively lower and less variable zn and fe concentrations  <cit> , demonstrating that improvements in these traits are possible. zn and fe deficiency afflict many parts of the developing world where wheat constitutes a major part of the diet, making the development of nutritionally-enhanced wheat varieties an important target for breeders tackling this problem  <cit> .

the main source of protein and micronutrients in the wheat grain is the flag leaf and, to a lesser extent, the lower leaves  <cit> . when applied to the leaf tip, radioactively-labelled zn is efficiently translocated to the developing wheat grain  <cit> . the close correlation between zn and fe content in the grain suggests some level of redundancy in the regulatory mechanisms used by the plant to transport these micronutrients  <cit> . however, the regulation of gene expression associated with nutrient transport from leaves to grain during wheat monocarpic senescence is poorly understood. a detailed understanding of these mechanisms will be required in order to engineer wheat varieties with improved nutritional quality through biofortification  <cit> .

several studies in other species, including barley, rice and arabidopsis have revealed distinct mechanisms regulating micronutrient transport in vegetative tissues, which are described below according to their sub-cellular location.

transport between chloroplast and cytoplasm
because of its importance to photosynthesis, fe is particularly abundant within the chloroplasts, which harbor ~90% of all fe in the leaf during vegetative development  <cit> . therefore, the remobilization of fe from the chloroplast is an important process during monocarpic senescence. in arabidopsis a member of the ferric chelate reductase  gene family is highly expressed in photosynthetic tissues and localizes to the chloroplast membrane, suggestive of a role in the reduction-based import of fe into the chloroplasts  <cit> . in rice, certain fro genes are preferentially expressed in the leaf vasculature rather than the roots, suggesting that this may be a conserved transport mechanism  <cit> . certain members of the heavy metal atpase  family of transporters have been implicated in the reverse process; nutrient export from the chloroplast to the cytoplasm. in arabidopsis, athma <dig> localizes to the chloroplast membrane and facilitates zn export from the chloroplast  <cit>  and in barley, hvhma <dig> facilitates both zn and fe export from the chloroplast  <cit> .

transport between vacuole and cytoplasm
additional mechanisms within the leaf exist to facilitate fe and zn transport between the vacuole and cytoplasm as part of a sequestration strategy, since high concentrations of either nutrient can be toxic for the plant cell. in rice, two vacuolar iron transporter genes, osvit <dig> and osvit <dig>  encode proteins which are localized to the vacuolar membrane  and facilitate zn2+ and fe2+ import to the vacuole  <cit> . likewise, the zinc-induced facilitator-like  genes encode zn-transporters which are implicated in vacuole transport. in arabidopsis, zif <dig> localizes to the tonoplast and zif <dig> mutants accumulate zn in the cytosol, suggesting that these transporters promote vacuolar sequestration of zn by facilitating its import into the vacuole  <cit> . however, several of the thirteen zifl genes recently described in rice are induced in the flag leaves during senescence  <cit> . this suggests that in monocots, certain zifl genes may also play a role in promoting nutrient remobilization during senescence. the nramp family of transporters appears to regulate nutrient export from the vacuole. in arabidopsis, nramp <dig> and nramp <dig> are induced in fe-deficient conditions and plants combining mutations in both these genes fail to mobilize vacuolar reserves of fe  <cit> .

transport from cytoplasm to phloem
for their transport to the grain, micronutrients must be transported from the cytoplasm across the plasma membrane to be loaded into the phloem. this process is facilitated by members of the yellow stripe like  and zrt, irt like protein  families of membrane-bound transporters, which transport metal-chelate complexes across the plasma membrane in the leaves of several plant species  <cit> . in arabidopsis, two fe-transporting members of the ysl gene family were shown to be essential for normal seed development  <cit>  and in barley, hvzip <dig> knockout mutant plants exhibit significantly reduced zn levels in the grain, suggesting that this family may also be important for nutrient loading into the phloem  <cit> .

because zn and fe ions exhibit limited solubility in the alkaline environment of the phloem, they are transported in association with a chelator  <cit> . nicotianamine  is one such important chelator and is a member of the mugineic acid family phytosiderophores  <cit> . na biosynthesis is regulated by the enzyme nicotianamine synthase  by combining three molecules of s-adenosyl methionine  <cit> , and can be further catalyzed to 2’-deoxymugineic acid  by the sequential activity of nicotianamine aminotransferase   <cit> , which generates a 3”-keto intermediate and dma synthase   <cit> . although zn has been shown to associate with dma in the rice phloem  <cit> , a recent study suggests that it is more commonly associated with na  <cit> . in contrast, the principal chelator of fe in the rice phloem is dma  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that phloem transport represents the major limiting factor determining zn and fe content of cereal grains  <cit>  and this is supported by several studies which demonstrate that altering nas expression can have significant impacts on zn and fe grain and seed content. in arabidopsis, plants carrying non-functional mutations in all nas genes exhibit low fe levels in sink tissues, while maintaining high levels in ageing leaves  <cit> . conversely, nas overexpression results in the accumulation of higher concentrations of zn and fe in arabidopsis seed  <cit> , rice grains  <cit>  and barley grains  <cit> .figure  <dig>

regulation of senescence and nutrient translocation
monocarpic senescence and nutrient translocation to the grain occur simultaneously, requiring a precise coordination of these two processes. this is reflected in the large-scale transcriptional changes in the plant’s vegetative tissues during the onset of senescence, as documented in recent expression studies in arabidopsis  <cit> , barley  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . these studies consistently identify increased expression levels of a number of transcription factors of different classes. particularly important roles have been identified for members of the nac family  <cit> . in wheat, one such nac-domain transcription factor, grain protein content  <dig> , has been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of both the rate of senescence and the levels of protein, zn and fe in the mature grain  <cit> .

originally identified as a qtl which enhances grain protein content in wild emmer   <cit> , the genomic region of chromosome arm 6bs including gpc <dig> was later shown to also accelerate senescence in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat  <cit> . a paralogous gene, gpc <dig> , was identified on chromosome arm 2bs, which shares 91% similarity with gpc <dig> at the dna level  <cit> . transcripts of gpc <dig> and gpc <dig> are first detected in flag leaves shortly before anthesis and increase rapidly during the early stages of senescence. in hexaploid wheat, plants transformed with a gpc-rnai construct targeting all homologous gpc genes and plants carrying loss-of-function mutations in all gpc <dig> homoeologs, both exhibit a three-week delay in the onset of senescence as well as significant reductions in the transport of amino acids , zn and fe to the grain  <cit> . therefore, gpc mutants represent an excellent tool to dissect the mechanisms underlying zn and fe transport from leaves to grains during monocarpic senescence.

in the current study, we used rna-seq to identify genes differentially regulated in the flag leaves during three early stages of monocarpic senescence in tetraploid wheat. we also identified genes that were differentially expressed within each of these stages between tetraploid wt and gpc mutants, which exhibited reduced zn and fe grain concentrations. we identified members of different transporter families, which were differentially regulated both during the early stages of senescence and between genotypes with different gpc alleles. results from this study define more precisely the role of individual gpc genes in the regulation of transporter gene families in senescing leaves and identify new differentially regulated targets for fe and zn biofortification strategies in wheat.

RESULTS
gpc <dig> and gpc <dig> mutations and their effect on senescence and nutrient translocation
field experiments comparing wild type , single , and double  mutants showed consistent results across the four tested environments . none of the gpc mutants showed significant differences in heading time relative to the wt, which is consistent with the known upregulation of the gpc genes after anthesis  <cit> . both the gpc-a <dig> and gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutants were associated with a significant delay in senescence relative to the wt and the gpc-b <dig> mutant. in the davis field experiment , these two mutants showed a 27-day delay in the onset of senescence in comparison to wt plants , and consistent results were observed in field experiments carried out in tel aviv and newe ya’ar . the differences in senescence observed between wt and gpc-b <dig> or between gpc-a <dig> and gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutants were comparatively much smaller .figure  <dig>

to test the effects of the gpc mutations on yield components in a tetraploid background, we measured thousand kernel weight  in three field environments and dry spike weight in the davis field experiment. we detected a marginally significant reduction in tkw associated with the gpc-a <dig> and gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutant genotypes . these mutant genotypes were also associated with significant reductions in dry spike weight in the davis field experiment which was lower in both gpc-a <dig> and gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutants at  <dig> daa  and in the gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutant at  <dig> and  <dig> daa .

the delays in the onset of senescence in the gpc-a <dig> and gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutants relative to wt plants were associated with reductions in protein, zn and fe levels in the mature grain . similarly, the marginal differences in senescence between wt and gpc-b <dig> or between gpc-a <dig> and gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutants  were paralleled by the absence of significant differences in protein, zn and fe levels in the grain in the different field experiments . similar reductions in gpc were observed across the different field experiments , which ranged between  <dig> %  and  <dig> % . micronutrient concentrations in the mature grain for each genotype in ucd- <dig> and tau- <dig> experiments are presented in additional file 1: table s <dig>  fe concentrations in the grain were significantly lower in both the gpc-a <dig>  and gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutants  when compared to wt samples in both locations . zn grain concentrations were also lower for the same mutant genotypes in both locations, but the differences were significant only in the ucd- <dig> experiment . interestingly, gpc-a <dig> and gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutants also exhibited significantly higher grain k concentrations than in wt plants, with increases ranging between  <dig> and 33% . all gpc and micronutrient values are reported as the concentration within the grain, so are unaffected by the variation in tkw detected between genotypes.

taken together, these results demonstrate that a knockout mutation of the gpc <dig> gene alone is sufficient to delay the onset of senescence and to perturb the translocation of protein, zn and fe to the developing grain in tetraploid durum wheat under field conditions. the gpc-b <dig> mutation had no significant effect on any of these traits, even in a genetic background with no functional gpc <dig> genes.

evaluation of the mapping reference used for rna-seq and overall characterization of loci expressed in each sample
to identify gpc-mediated transcriptional changes associated with the onset of senescence, we carried out an rna-seq study focusing on three genotypes; wt and the two mutants that showed the largest differences in senescence in the previous field experiments, gpc-a <dig> and gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig>  none of the plants sampled at heading date , 12 days after anthesis  or  <dig> daa, showed signs of chlorophyll degradation in the flag leaves or yellowing of the peduncles , confirming that the selected time points represent relatively early stages of the senescence process. clear differences between genotypes were apparent five weeks later , when the wt plants showed more advanced symptoms of senescence than either of the two gpc mutants . this result indicates that in this greenhouse experiment, the effects of the gpc genes were consistent with those observed in the field experiments described above .

on average,  <dig> million trimmed rna-seq reads were generated for each of the four replicates of each of the nine genotype/time point combinations included in this study . most of the reads  were mapped to the reference genomic contigs generated by the international wheat genome sequencing consortium  using flow-sorted chromosomes arms of t. aestivum cv. chinese spring  <cit> . since we were mapping transcripts of a tetraploid wheat cultivar, only the sequences from the a and b genome chromosome arms were used as a reference.

a large proportion of the trimmed reads  mapped within the  <dig>  previously defined transcribed genomic loci within this reference , suggesting that these loci provide a good representation of the transcribed portion of the wheat genome. however, only  <dig> % of these reads mapped to unique locations , most likely due to a combination of the high level of similarity shared by the coding regions of a and b homoeologs , and the short length of the reads used in this study . ambiguously mapped reads were excluded from the statistical analyses described below, resulting in an average of  <dig>  m uniquely mapped reads per sample.

after excluding ambiguously mapped reads, only  <dig>  of the genomic loci showed transcript coverage above the selected threshold for the statistical analyses . the complete list of statistical analyses performed for these  <dig>  loci is summarized in additional file  <dig>  probability values for all four statistical tests are presented in this table so researchers can reanalyze the data using different statistical analyses and levels of stringency for specific sets of genes. where available, this table also describes the high-confidence protein coding gene corresponding to each genomic locus, derived from the recent annotation of these wheat genomic contigs  <cit> .

principal component analysis  of the uniquely mapped reads at each time point showed limited clustering of the samples according to their genotype at hd , very clear groupings at  <dig> daa , and intermediate clustering at  <dig> daa . the reciprocal analysis, to distinguish samples according to time point within each genotype, showed that in all three genotypes, the hd samples were more clearly separated than the two later time points . the clearer separation of both gpc mutants from the wt, and of gpc-a <dig> from gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> at  <dig> daa than at either hd or  <dig> daa, suggests that both gpc <dig> and gpc <dig> genes have a major regulatory role at this early stage of senescence .

following mapping, we confirmed the genotype of each sample by analyzing pileups of reads which mapped to the genomic loci corresponding to the gpc-a <dig> and gpc-b <dig> genes. the expected tilling mutations  were confirmed in the expected mutant genotypes and were absent in all wt samples. all gpc genes showed a low number of mapped reads at hd, with significant increases at  <dig> daa and  <dig> daa . approximately 3-4-fold more reads mapped to gpc <dig> homoeologous genes than to the gpc <dig> genes, a pattern which was consistent across all genotypes .

we detected no significant differences in the expression profiles of gpc-a <dig> and gpc-b <dig> between wt and gpc mutant genotypes suggesting that the mutations in these genes did not affect the stability of the transcribed mrnas, and that neither gpc-a <dig> nor gpc-b <dig> functional proteins exhibit a feedback regulatory mechanism on their own transcription . however, at  <dig> daa, gpc-a <dig> expression was significantly lower in wt plants than in either gpc-a <dig>  or gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig>  mutants, suggesting that there may exist some gpc-mediated feedback mechanism on the regulation of gpc-a <dig> transcript levels .

identification of loci differentially expressed during monocarpic senescence in wt plants
applying stringent selection criteria , we identified  <dig>  contigs which were differentially expressed  in at least one pairwise comparison among sampling times in the wt genotype . as expected, the comparison between hd and  <dig> daa showed the largest number of de loci , followed by the comparison between hd and  <dig> daa . the comparison between  <dig> daa and  <dig> daa showed the lowest number of de loci .figure  <dig>

of the loci which were significantly de in the wt plants between hd and  <dig> daa, a larger proportion were upregulated  than were downregulated . the reverse was true for loci de between  <dig> daa and  <dig> daa, when  <dig> % of loci were upregulated and  <dig> % were downregulated. this suggests that during the first  <dig> daa different mechanisms required to actively prepare the plant for the upcoming senescence are upregulated, which is followed by the shutdown of many biological processes and the downregulation of a large number of genes.

we next determined whether any previously characterized senescence associated genes were also differentially expressed in our dataset. in a wheat microarray study,  <dig> annotated genes were identified which were differentially expressed during eight stages of senescence, ranging from anthesis to yellowing leaves  <cit> . we identified the corresponding genes within our dataset using blast  and found that  <dig>  were also significantly differentially expressed during senescence in the current study . this relatively low percent is not unexpected since our study covers only the early stages of senescence whereas the previous study covered a more extended period. a second microarray experiment in barley identified a set of genes differentially expressed between nils divergent for a high-gpc genomic segment at  <dig> daa and at  <dig> daa  <cit> . in the leaves,  <dig>  genes were upregulated in at least one of these time-points and  <dig>  were downregulated. among the upregulated genes, we identified  <dig> which were also significantly up-regulated during senescence, and of the down-regulated genes,  <dig> were also significantly down-regulated within our dataset, which used different statistical stringency criteria. the use of different technologies  and different species may also contribute to the different sets of differentially expressed genes detected in these studies. the genes regulated by senescence in both experiments are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

this study in tetraploid wheat supersedes our previous rna-seq analysis in hexaploid wheat comparing the transcriptomes of wt and transgenic gpc-rnai lines with reduced transcript levels of gpc <dig> and gpc <dig> at  <dig> daa  <cit> . in the current study, we generated a greater number of reads, studied additional time-points, used targeted knockouts of individual gpc genes and had access to a more comprehensive wheat genome mapping reference. among the differentially expressed genes common to both studies were three genes of biological interest selected for validation in the previous study  <cit> .

identification of loci differentially expressed among gpc genotypes
we next identified loci which were de between genotypes. the largest number of de loci was detected between the wt and the double gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutants , an expected result given that this comparison includes genes regulated by both gpc-a <dig> and gpc-b <dig> . the comparison between the wt and the single gpc-a <dig> mutant, expected to detect mainly gpc-a1-regulated genes, showed a much lower number of de genes  than the previous comparison. a total of  <dig> of these loci  were de in both these comparisons and are designated hereafter as high-confidence gpc-a1-regulated genes. the third comparison, between the gpc-a <dig> and gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutant genotypes, expected to detect mainly genes regulated by gpc-b <dig>  yielded a lower number of de loci . most of these loci  were also de in the comparison between the wt and the gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> double mutant and are designated hereafter as high-confidence gpc-b2-regulated genes. there were  <dig> loci which were de in all three comparisons between genotypes, and these likely represent genes redundantly regulated by both gpc-a <dig> and gpc-b <dig> genes . similarly, the  <dig>  loci de only between the wt and double gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutants but not in the other two classes , likely include loci that are redundantly regulated by both genes, but that show significant differences in expression only when mutations in both gpc paralogs are combined.

to determine how these differences between genotypes were distributed in time, we made pairwise comparisons between genotypes within each of the three time points. since both gpc <dig> and gpc <dig> expression is relatively low at hd , we expected to find a small number of de loci among gpc genotypes at this time point. indeed, only ten genes were de between wt and the gpc-a <dig> single mutant, only six between wt and the gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> double mutant and  <dig> between the gpc-a <dig> and gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutants at hd. two loci were shared between the wt vs. gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> and gpc-a <dig> vs. gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> comparisons, suggesting they may potentially be regulated by gpc-b <dig> and one gene was common to the wt vs. gpc-a <dig> and wt vs. gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> comparisons, suggesting it may be regulated by gpc-a <dig>  these results confirm that gpc genes have only a marginal effect on the wheat transcriptome at this developmental stage.

by contrast, the number of de loci between genotypes was much greater at  <dig> daa. of the  <dig> loci de between wt and the gpc-a <dig> single mutant,  <dig>  were de at  <dig> daa and only six  at  <dig> daa. similarly, of the  <dig>  loci de between wt and the gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> double mutant  <dig>   were de at  <dig> daa, whereas only  <dig>  were de at  <dig> daa. of the  <dig> de genes in the comparison between the gpc-a <dig> single mutant and the gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> double mutant,  <dig> were de at  <dig> daa, whereas only  <dig> genes were de at  <dig> daa. these results suggest that even though gpc <dig> and gpc <dig> expression continues to rise between  <dig> daa and  <dig> daa , the major effect of both these genes on the regulation of downstream genes occurs at  <dig> daa.

we next compared the two sets of high-confidence gpc-regulated loci with the senescence-regulated loci. a broad overlap was detected between gpc-a1-regulated and senescence-regulated loci, with  <dig> of the  <dig>  high-confidence gpc-a1-regulated loci also de during senescence . by contrast, of the  <dig> high-confidence gpc-b2-regulated loci only  <dig>  were also de during senescence . surprisingly, 81% of the genes upregulated during the first  <dig> daa in wt plants  were no longer significant in the gpc-a <dig> mutant. this observation highlights the critical role of gpc <dig> in the activation of a large number of genes during the early stages of monocarpic senescence, possibly to prepare the plant for the upcoming senescence.

distribution of expression profiles among different genotypic classes
to further analyze the loci de during senescence, we classified them into eight classes based on their upregulation , downregulation  or absence of significant differences  between hd and  <dig> daa, and between  <dig> daa to  <dig> daa . loci which were not significantly de in either of these comparisons, but were significantly up or downregulated between hd and  <dig> daa were included in the ‘up-up’ and ‘down-down’ classes, respectively. when all  <dig>  loci de during senescence in wt plants were considered  all eight classes were well represented with slightly higher proportions in the three classes that include loci upregulated between hd and  <dig> daa . a different picture emerged when, among the loci de during senescence, we considered only the high-confidence gpc-a <dig>  and gpc-b <dig>  regulated genes. in both cases the ‘up-down’ class was dominant, representing  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the de loci, respectively . however, a difference between these two groups was evident in the second most abundant class; ‘up-flat’ in the high-confidence gpc-a1-regulated genes , and ‘down-up’ in the high-confidence gpc-b2-regulated genes . in both groups, the remaining six classes represented less than 12% of the de loci. these data indicate that while both genes have their greatest effect at  <dig> daa, a partial differentiation exists of the loci and processes regulated by the gpc-a <dig> and gpc-b <dig> genes.figure  <dig>

gene ontology analysis
we next used blast2go to generate ‘biological process’ gene ontology  terms for each locus to compare the proportions of different functional categories between loci up- and downregulated during senescence in wt and between high-confidence gpc-a1- and gpc-b2-regulated loci . to simplify the description of these functional analyses, we first combined the eight functional categories from figure 4a into four: upregulated loci , downregulated loci , ‘up-down’, and ‘down-up’.table  <dig>

among loci upregulated during senescence, we observed enrichment in transport functions and catabolism of photosynthetic proteins. four of the top five most significantly enriched go terms included those related to transmembrane transporter function . by contrast, loci downregulated during senescence were enriched in functions related to biosynthetic processes, especially photosynthesis . these results, together with the previous observation that upregulated loci were more abundant between wt and  <dig> daa  and downregulated loci were more abundant between  <dig> and  <dig> daa , are indicative of the early activation of catabolic enzymes and transport systems followed by the downregulation of growth promoting processes in the leaves during these two early stages of senescence.

go term analysis among the  <dig> high-confidence gpc-a1-regulated genes showed a significant enrichment of categories similar to the patterns observed for loci upregulated during senescence, with the ten most significantly enriched terms all relating to transporter activity . although transporter functions were also enriched among the  <dig> high-confidence gpc-b2-regulated genes, several unrelated terms were also enriched in this class but not in the gpc-a1-regulated class, including genes with putative roles in cell wall biogenesis and microtubule organization.

the closer similarity in go term enrichment between senescence-regulated loci and gpc-a1-regulated genes than with gpc-b2-regulated genes is consistent with the greater overlap between senescence-regulated and gpc-regulated loci  and with the relatively stronger effect of the gpc-a <dig> mutation on senescence and nutrient transport relative to the gpc-b <dig> mutation . taken together, these results suggest that gpc-a <dig> plays a more important role than gpc-b <dig> in the regulation of genes controlling the early stages of monocarpic senescence in wheat.

identification and expression analysis of wheat transporter genes
to categorize the wheat transporters upregulated during senescence and to determine the role of gpc <dig> in their regulation, we identified specific wheat homologues of fe and zn transporters previously characterized in other plant species and determined their expression profiles both among different time points during senescence and between gpc genotypes.

chloroplastic transporters
among genes previously known to be involved in the reduction-based import of fe into the chloroplasts, we identified two fro genes in triticum aestivum , one of which, tafro <dig>  was highly expressed at hd and significantly downregulated during senescence in wt plants . by comparison, tafro <dig> expression was lower, and although its expression also fell during senescence, differences between time points were not significant. neither gene was significantly de among genotypes.table  <dig>

among genes previously known to promote the export of nutrients from the chloroplast to the cytoplasm, we identified five t. aestivum members of the zn/co/cd/pb-transporting class of hma genes . two of these genes, tahma <dig> and tahma2-like, which showed the highest similarity to oshma <dig> , were significantly upregulated during senescence, both showing >6-fold increases in expression between hd and  <dig> daa . furthermore, tahma2-like expression was significantly reduced in both gpc mutants, implicating a role for gpc in its regulation. two other genes, tahma <dig> and tahma-like <dig> which are both similar to oshma <dig> , were not de during senescence and a third, tahma <dig>  was not detected at any time point in this study.

vacuolar transporters
two vit transporters, which promote fe and zn import in to the vacuole, were previously characterized in rice  <cit> . both of the corresponding wheat homologues of these genes were downregulated ~4-fold during senescence, but these differences were not significant according to our stringent differential expression criteria . furthermore, neither gene was de in either of the gpc mutant genotypes .

eight wheat zifl genes, thought to promote vacuolar sequestration of zn  <cit> , were identified and annotated in this study . two tazifl genes  were expressed at negligible levels in all time points included in this study and were excluded from further analyses . among the six tazifl genes which showed higher levels of expression during senescence, tazifl2-like <dig> and tazifl <dig> were significantly upregulated during senescence while tazifl <dig> was significantly downregulated. interestingly, although it was not upregulated during senescence, tazifl <dig> expression was significantly higher in wt plants than in both gpc mutants .

among the genes known to promote fe export from the vacuole to the cytoplasm, eight nramp genes were recently described in wheat  <cit> . five of these genes showed very low levels of expression in flag leaves during the time points included in our study, suggesting that they may play more important roles during other developmental stages or in other tissues. of the three nramp genes with higher expression levels during senescence, tanramp <dig> and tanramp <dig> both exhibited stable expression, but tanramp <dig> was significantly upregulated, showing a ~5-fold increase in expression between hd and  <dig> daa . no significant differences among genotypes were detected for any of the nramp genes.

plasma-membrane transporters
after being transported into the cytoplasm, zn and fe must be loaded into the phloem for their transport to different sink tissues, including the grain. in rice and barley, the ysl and zip gene families appear to play a prominent role in this process.

we identified a total of  <dig> ysl genes within available wheat databases , but one of these genes is likely a pseudogene . among the functional ysl genes, taysl <dig> and taysl <dig> were significantly upregulated during senescence and taysl <dig> was significantly downregulated . although not de during senescence, taysl <dig> expression was significantly reduced in the gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutant compared to the wt.

the largest transporter gene family described in this study is the zip family, with a total of  <dig> wheat genes identified , including seven which had been described previously  <cit> . this family also includes the iron regulated transporter  genes, which share high similarity to the zips. one gene  was absent from the genomic reference so was excluded from the analysis, but five of the remaining  <dig> tazip genes were significantly upregulated during senescence . some of these genes showed very large increases in expression between time points. for example, tazip <dig> was upregulated 5-fold and tazip <dig> 8-fold between hd and  <dig> daa . strikingly, the expression of all five of these upregulated genes, as well as tazip <dig> and tazip <dig>  was significantly higher in wt plants than in either gpc mutant genotype. additionally, tairt <dig> expression was significantly lower in the gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutant than in the wt. these results strongly implicate a role for gpc <dig> in the regulation of the zip family of transporters during senescence .

phytosiderophore biosynthesis genes
since the association of zn and fe with ps chelating ligands facilitates their transport through the phloem, we searched for wheat homologs of genes encoding enzymes acting in the ps biosynthetic pathway . searches of available wheat genomic databases yielded two tanas, two tanaat and one tadmas genes.

expression of tanas <dig> more than doubled between  <dig> daa and  <dig> daa,  and was significantly reduced in gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutant compared to the wt . in contrast, tanas <dig> was expressed at much lower levels and did not vary during senescence or among genotypes .

both of the identified wheat naat genes were upregulated during senescence, although only for tanaat <dig> was this significant . interestingly, tanaat <dig> was upregulated at an earlier stage than tanas <dig>  since its expression doubled between hd and  <dig> daa and remained stable thereafter . the expression of both tanaat genes was significantly lower in both gpc mutant genotypes, suggesting a role for gpc in the regulation of this class of gene. the third ps biosynthesis gene, tadmas was not de at any stage of senescence or in any of the genotype comparisons .

as a technical control, we developed qrt-pcr assays for six transporter genes which were significantly de between wt and gpc mutants. for all six genes, we obtained results that were consistent with the expression profiles determined by rna-seq. results from both analyses are presented side by side in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

to look for additional transporters, we further explored the group of  <dig>  genes that were significantly upregulated between hd and  <dig> daa in the wt plants but not in the gpc-a <dig> mutants. this dataset included  <dig> genes with annotated transporter function which were also significantly different among genotypes ,  <dig> of which were members of the characterized transporter families described above . the remaining  <dig> genes included members of other transporter families, including one potassium transporter , two sulfate transporters, one abc transporter and a gene encoding a ferritin protein, involved in fe storage . the differential regulation of the potassium and sulfate transporters is particularly interesting given the significant differences in k and s concentrations in the grain detected between wt and both gpc-a <dig> and gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutants .

taken together, our results suggest that the onset of monocarpic senescence in wheat is associated with broad transcriptional changes involved in nutrient remobilization. these processes included the export of zn and fe from chloroplasts and vacuoles , upregulation of trans-membrane transporter genes responsible for loading nutrients into the phloem , and upregulation of ps biosynthesis genes  to facilitate transport of these nutrients through the phloem. among these changes, the gpc genes seem to play a limited role in the regulation of vacuolar and chloroplastic transporter genes, but have a clear role in the upregulation of both ps biosynthesis genes and transmembrane transporters, with a particularly prominent role in regulating members of the zip gene family.

discussion
in annual grasses, senescing leaves are an important source of zn and fe for the developing grain. when the transport mechanisms between these tissues are disrupted, as in the gpc mutants and gpc-rnai transgenic plants described in this and previous studies  <cit> , concentrations of zn and fe in the grain are significantly reduced. we used rna-seq to characterize the overall transcriptional changes in senescing flag leaves in wt and gpc mutant plants. we identified several zn and fe transporter genes activated during these early stages of senescence and describe their regulation by the gpc genes.

applying rna-seq to polyploidy wheat
one challenge for genomic studies in polyploid species is the difficulty in distinguishing highly similar homoeologous genomes . although different approaches to separate homoeologous sequences have been applied , it remains difficult to fully resolve chimeric assemblies. we overcame this problem in the current study by using the recently-released genomic draft sequence of wheat chromosome arms from the iwgsc as our rna-seq mapping reference  <cit> . to generate the genomic draft sequence, wheat chromosome arms were first separated by flow cytometry, so each arm was sequenced and assembled separately, resulting in homoeolog-specific reference sequences.

at the time of our analysis, this genomic reference lacked any gene annotation so we first identified genomic ranges, which are defined by one or more overlapping transcripts . a large proportion of our reads mapped to these expressed loci , indicating that they include a good representation of the expressed portion of the wheat genome. recently, the iwgsc annotated  <dig>  high-confidence protein-coding genes in the a and b chromosome arms  <cit> ,  <dig>   of which overlapped with loci identified in our study. the corresponding iwgsc loci and gene names for each matching locus are provided in additional file  <dig>  a small number of sequencing reads  mapped within genomic ranges defined by the  <dig>  iwgsc loci not identified in our annotation, and were not included in the current study.

the use of a homoeolog-specific genomic reference instead of a transcriptome reduced mapping ambiguity in two ways; firstly by eliminating chimeric assemblies of similar homoeologous sequences, and secondly by collapsing multiple transcribed variant sequences into a single genomic locus in the reference, thus eliminating redundancy and increasing mapping specificity. this approach combines the expression of alternative splicing forms, which we consider appropriate for this initial study. a relatively high proportion of these reads were mapped uniquely , and only these reads were used for our differential expression analyses, thus maximizing the accuracy of these analyses.

the role of gpc <dig> and gpc <dig> during monocarpic senescence
previous studies have demonstrated that transgenic plants expressing an rnai construct targeting all copies of gpc <dig> and gpc <dig> exhibit a significant delay in senescence and reduced levels of zn, fe and protein in the grain, due to a disruption in their transport  <cit> . in the current study, we also detected a marginally significant reduction in tkw and in dry spike weight during grain filling associated with the gpc <dig> mutant genotype. interestingly, these differences were evident even from the early stages of senescence  suggesting that the gpc genes may also affect the rate of grain filling. although the differences in spike weight between genotypes decreased with time, they were still significant at the end of the grain filling period . the high spring temperatures characteristic of the mediterranean environments used in our studies, may have contributed to the lower kernel weight of the gpc mutant lines that matured during periods of higher temperature than the wt lines.

it was previously unknown whether gpc genes regulated the induction of the overall senescence process, or whether they regulated just a subset of the genes differentially regulated during this developmental stage. also unclear was the time within the senescence process when the gpc genes have their strongest effect, or the extent of functional overlap between gpc <dig> and gpc <dig> paralogs. results from our study provide insights into all three of these questions.

comparing senescence- and gpc-regulated genes
to answer the first question, we investigated the overlap between senescence and gpc regulated genes. of the  <dig>  loci de during senescence in wt plants, only  <dig> % also showed significant differences in expression between gpc genotypes . in addition, within the senescence-regulated genes the subset regulated by the gpc genes showed different proportions of expression categories compared to the complete senescence set . whereas more than 60% of gpc-regulated genes in this set exhibited an ‘up-down’ expression profile, the proportion in all senescence-regulated genes was 20%. conversely, the proportion of genes exhibiting an ‘up-up’ expression profile and those falling into any of the downregulated classes were 9– <dig> fold more abundant among senescence-regulated genes than the subset regulated by gpc genes .

these results support the hypothesis that the gpc genes regulate a specific subset of genes during monocarpic senescence rather than triggering the overall transcriptional regulatory cascade associated with this developmental stage. the disruption of the regulation of this subset of senescence-regulated genes in the gpc mutants is likely sufficient to generate bottlenecks in the senescence process, as demonstrated by the overall delay in senescence observed in these mutant genotypes .

gpc-regulated genes at different time points
in a pca analysis based on the expression of all genes, the differences between wt and gpc mutant genotypes were much clearer at  <dig> daa than at either hd or  <dig> daa . this is consistent with our finding that the majority of gpc-regulated genes  were detected at  <dig> daa. these results suggest that, despite the continued increase in gpc expression between  <dig> daa and  <dig> daa , most of the regulatory effects of the gpc genes on the de of downstream genes occur within the first  <dig> daa.

comparison between gpc <dig> and gpc <dig> regulated genes
the paralogous genes gpc <dig> and gpc <dig> share 91% similarity at the dna level and have almost identical expression profiles during the early stages of senescence . therefore, some functional overlap between these genes was expected. among the three pairwise comparisons among genotypes , the largest category includes the  <dig>  de genes detected between the wt and the gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutant, that were not among the gpc-a1-specific  or gpc-b2-specific  de genes. this category most likely includes genes that are redundantly regulated by gpc-a <dig> and gpc-b <dig>  but that are significant only when both genes are absent. combining these  <dig>  genes with the  <dig> which are de in both gpc-a1-specific and gpc-b2-specific comparisons , we conclude that approximately two-thirds of the gpc-regulated genes  showed some level of redundancy in their regulation by gpc-a <dig> and gpc-b <dig>  this result parallels the similar proportion of ‘up-down’ regulated genes among the high confidence gpc-a1- and gpc-b2-regulated genes .

however, the remaining one-third of the loci de among genotypes were regulated either by gpc-a <dig>  or by gpc-b <dig> , suggestive of some level of functional divergence. this was apparent in the differences between classes in expression profiles during senescence. both sets of genes showed a strong enrichment for ‘up-down’ regulated genes, but the second most abundant category was ‘up-flat’ in the gpc-a1-regulated genes  and ‘down-up’ in the gpc-b2-regulated genes . these results suggest that gpc-a <dig> acts principally to upregulate genes during the early stage of senescence , whereas gpc-b <dig>  in addition to its role in the upregulation of a number of genes, also targets a subset of genes for downregulation during the same period.

distinctions between gpc-a1- and gpc-b2-regulated genes were also apparent in their putative functions identified in the go analysis and in their respective overlap with senescence-regulated genes. the proportion of gpc-a1-regulated genes that were also regulated by senescence  was almost double the corresponding proportion of gpc-b2-regulated genes . moreover, putative functions of the senescence regulated genes were more similar to the functions of gpc-a1-regulated genes than to those regulated by gpc-b <dig>  whereas both senescence-regulated and gpc-a1-regulated genes were significantly enriched for transporter function , such enrichment was less evident among the gpc-b2-regulated genes. instead, this class was enriched for genes with putative roles in plant cell wall biogenesis, microtubule organization and other processes distinct from those found in the senescence-regulated genes.

these results are consistent with the stronger effect of gpc-a <dig> knockout mutants on senescence and nutrient translocation profiles in the current study  and with the strong effect seen on these phenotypes in gpc1-null mutants in hexaploid wheat  <cit> . one caveat of this comparison is that while the gpc-a <dig> mutation in the tetraploid variety ‘kronos’ represents a true gpc1-null allele , the gpc-b <dig> mutant likely alters the dosage of gpc <dig> but does not result in a gpc2-null mutant . no gpc-a <dig> truncation mutant was found in our current tetraploid tilling population, but we are currently transferring a gpc-a <dig> premature stop codon mutant found in our hexaploid wheat tilling population  <cit>  into kronos. the lack of a gpc-a <dig> truncation mutant in this study does not affect the interpretation of the gpc-b <dig> regulated genes, but may have resulted in an underestimation of the number of genes regulated by gpc <dig> 

despite the high sequence similarity of gpc <dig> and gpc <dig> and their common expression profiles in the wheat flag leaf during monocarpic senescence, these genes appear to have diverged to regulate different sets of downstream targets. the closest rice ortholog to the wheat gpc genes is os07g <dig> which maps to a region of the genome collinear to gpc <dig>  <cit> . this suggests that gpc <dig> is the ancestral gene and that gpc <dig> originated from a duplication event specific to the wheat lineage  <cit> . however, the downregulation of os07g <dig> by rnai, or its overexpression in transgenic rice plants, did not affect the rate of senescence. the only difference observed in os07g37920-rnai rice plants was male sterility caused by the inability of the anther to dehisce and release pollen  <cit> . these results suggest that the specialization of gpc <dig> on the regulation of transporters during senescence, and its stronger effect on the rate of senescence, are likely derived characteristics acquired by gpc <dig> after its duplication to its non-orthologous location on the short arm of homoeologous group  <dig> chromosomes.

a recent study showed that the rice gene osnap, a close paralogue of os07g <dig> and of wheat gpc <dig>  has a strong effect on senescence .

in summary, the results described in this section indicate that the gpc genes regulate a subset of senescence-regulated genes that are mainly upregulated during the early stages of monocarpic senescence . although most gpc-regulated genes are affected by both paralogs, gpc <dig> seems to play a stronger role than gpc <dig> in the regulation of a subset of genes involved in senescence that includes enrichment for transporter gene function. however, in the absence of a complete knockout of gpc <dig>  we cannot fully determine the role of gpc <dig> in monocarpic senescence. the importance of gpc <dig> in the regulation of senescence is highlighted by the finding that among the  <dig>  genes upregulated in the wt between hd and  <dig> daa  <dig>  were not upregulated in the gpc-a <dig> mutant.

effect of gpc genes on previously characterized genes involved in transport
to complement the top-down analyses discussed above, we also characterized the effect of gpc and senescence on the expression of nine gene families previously shown to play important roles in nutrient remobilization in other plant species. the discussion of these genes is organized according to their involvement in different transport processes.

chloroplast to cytoplasm
our results demonstrate that the early stages of monocarpic senescence in the flag leaf are associated with a large-scale downregulation of genes involved in photosynthetic processes . therefore, the downregulation of tafro <dig>  which is likely involved in the import of fe into the chloroplast is not surprising. studies in model species have demonstrated that some members of the fro family localize to the chloroplast membrane and act in the reduction-based import of nutrients into the chloroplast  <cit> . in rice, osfro <dig> transcript levels are negatively correlated with zn and fe levels in the rice grain  <cit> .

by contrast, we observed a significant upregulation of two wheat members of the hma transporter family during senescence which have been implicated in zn and fe export from the chloroplast to the cytoplasm  <cit> . the expression of one of these genes, tahma2-like, was also significantly higher in wt plants than either gpc-a <dig> or gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutants, which may contribute to the reduced efficiency in zn and fe remobilization observed in these mutants. the rice ortholog of this gene, oshma <dig>  was shown to play an important role in facilitating zn transport to the rice panicle  <cit> . these results suggest that nutrient remobilization from the chloroplasts to the cytoplasm for future export to the grain is an early step in wheat monocarpic senescence.

vacuole to cytoplasm transport
another sink for zn and fe during vegetative development is the vacuole, which is utilized as a storage body to prevent plant cell toxicity associated with excess concentrations of these nutrients. in other plant species, vit and zifl transporters have been shown to facilitate nutrient import into the vacuole, while nramp transporters have been implicated in fe export from the vacuole to the cytoplasm. in our study, the expression of both identified wheat vit genes fell during monocarpic senescence, with tavit <dig> showing a ~4-fold reduction between hd and  <dig> daa. however, these differences were not significant for all four statistical tests and were excluded from our de list. in rice, both osvit <dig> and osvit <dig> proteins localize to the tonoplast and can transport zn2+ and fe2+ across this membrane as part of a vacuolar sequestration strategy  <cit> . mutants with reduced or abolished function of both these genes exhibit reduced zn and fe concentrations in the leaves coupled with increased levels in the grains, suggesting that a downregulation of these genes during senescence contributes to increased rates of zn and fe translocation  <cit> .

the zifl family of transporters is also thought to function in the vacuole. one such transporter in arabidopsis was implicated in zn sequestration to the vacuole in vegetative tissues  <cit> , while in barley, a zifl-like gene is expressed in the aleurone layer of seeds and is induced in the embryo upon foliar zn application and has been implicated in the regulation of zn transport to the grain  <cit> . these potentially distinct roles of the different zifl genes may explain the differences in transcription profiles observed in this study. tazifl <dig> was significantly downregulated during senescence, whereas tazifl2-like <dig> and tazifl <dig> were significantly upregulated. the rice orthologs of these genes  are both upregulated in flag leaves during senescence suggesting that they may promote zn remobilization during senescence  <cit> . oszifl <dig> expression was not detected in rice flag leaves at any stage of development. further studies will be required to better characterize the function of zifl transporters in wheat.

none of the eight nramp genes identified in wheat were de between wt and gpc mutants and only one  was significantly upregulated during senescence . this upregulation during senescence is consistent with the known function of this class of transporters, which are thought to facilitate fe export from the vacuole when remobilization is required during development  <cit> . however, our finding that most of the wheat nramp genes were not de during wheat senescence suggests that these transporters may act in other tissues or stages of developmental stages.

in summary, among the genes involved in the transport for fe and zn to and from the vacuole only tazifl <dig> was de in both gpc mutant genotypes, suggesting a limited effect of the gpc genes in the regulation of this group of genes. however, it will still be interesting to investigate the role of tazifl <dig> and of the other three genes from this group which are de during senescence.

cytoplasm to phloem transport
for their transport to the grain, nutrients must cross the plasma membrane into the phloem. members of the ysl and zip families are known to play important roles in the transport of metal-chelate complexes across the plasma membrane in several plant species   <cit> . in wheat, we identified and characterized  <dig> and  <dig> members of the ysl  and zip  families, respectively. two of the wheat ysl genes were upregulated during senescence and one was downregulated, suggesting that they performed different functions . however, there is still little evidence from the literature regarding ysl function in vegetative zn and fe transport, so further experiments will be required to define their role in wheat.

a much clearer link between gpc <dig> and zn and fe transport during monocarpic senescence was observed for members of the zip gene family. a total of five tazip genes were upregulated during senescence and the expression of all five plus tazip <dig> and tazip <dig> was significantly higher in wt plants than in either gpc-a <dig> or gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> mutant genotypes. tairt-like <dig> was also de, but only between wt and the gpc-a1/gpc-b <dig> double mutant . in some cases, the effect was very large; for example, the expression of both tazip <dig> and tazip <dig> were more than 15-fold higher in wt plants than either of the gpc mutant genotypes at  <dig> daa. these results demonstrate that gpc plays a critical role in the regulation of multiple members of this family and that zip expression is likely to be associated with the remobilization of zn and fe from leaves to grain in wheat. a recent study in barley demonstrated that the over-expression of hvzip <dig> resulted in increased zn accumulation in the grain  <cit> . the corresponding wheat homologue, tazip <dig>  was also significantly upregulated by gpc during senescence in the current study, suggesting a conserved role for this transporter. for future biotechnological applications, it will be important to determine which of these zip transporters represents a limiting step in the remobilization of zn and fe from leaves to the grain.

ps biosynthesis
it has been hypothesized that a critical limiting factor for nutrient transport to the grain is their solubility in the alkaline environment of the phloem  <cit> . to prevent precipitation, fe and zn ions are transported as a complex with organic ligands or chelators, one critical class of which is the mugineic acid family of ps . we show in this study that several wheat genes encoding key biosynthetic enzymes of this pathway are upregulated during senescence and are differentially regulated by the gpc genes. a significant upregulation in tanaat <dig> expression between hd and  <dig> daa and an increase in tanas <dig> between  <dig> daa and  <dig> daa suggest an active and possibly coordinated role of these genes during wheat monocarpic senescence. both tanaat genes were de in at least one gpc mutant genotype  suggesting that they might contribute to the reduced concentrations of fe and zn observed in the grains of the gpc mutant plants. no significant differences were detected for tadmas <dig> 

in the rice phloem, fe and zn can associate with both na and dma, although zn-na and fe-dma complexes have been shown to be more common  <cit> . nas overexpression has been shown to result in dramatic increases in both zn and fe grain content in rice  <cit> , making the orthologous genes in wheat interesting targets for biofortification strategies. multiple transgenic strategies have been successfully applied in rice to increase micronutrient levels in the grain  <cit> , although to date, such strategies have not been described in wheat. the characterization of the different transporter gene families during wheat monocarpic senescence provides the basic information required to select targets for similar biotechnological approaches in this economically important crop species.

in addition to these well-characterized transporter families, we also identified  <dig> other transporter-related genes which were upregulated between hd and  <dig> daa in wt plants, but not in gpc-a <dig> mutants . among these genes, we found one differentially regulated potassium transporter and two sulfate transporters, which are potentially related to the differences identified in k and s concentrations in the grain between genotypes . a similar increase in k and decrease in s, zn and fe concentration was also observed in the grains of gpc-rnai transgenic plants with reduced transcriptional levels of all gpc genes  <cit> . it will be interesting to investigate whether there is a functional connection between the de of fe, zn, s and k transporters and the effect of the gpc genes on their concentration, in the wheat grain.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study confirms that gpc <dig> plays a strong role in the regulation of wheat monocarpic senescence, and that it is involved in the upregulation of a large number of genes during the early stages of wheat monocarpic senescence. these genes are likely involved in the plant’s active preparation for the upcoming senescence. supporting this hypothesis, we found several transporters and genes involved in the biosynthesis of chelators that facilitate zn and fe transport through the phloem that were differentially regulated by the gpc genes. among these transporters, members of the large zip gene family appear to be interesting targets for biotechnological applications and for screening of different natural alleles to improve nutrient remobilization.
