BACKGROUND
the apoptotic pathway of programmed cell death, which was discovered in caenorhabditis elegans, is thought to be an ancient metazoan innovation on the basis of the apparent conservation of some key components from sponges to mammals  <cit> . apoptosis not only serves to minimize collateral damage following stress or cellular insult, but also plays critical roles in development, morphogenesis and immunity. jacobson et al.  <cit>  noted four functions of apoptosis: sculpting, as in removal of the webbing between digits in the developing mammal; deleting structures, as in removal of the tail of the developing frog; adjusting cell numbers, as in the nervous systems of both vertebrates and invertebrates and eliminating dangerous or injured cells, as in the elimination of defective t and b lymphocytes in the vertebrate immune system. apoptosis has been most extensively studied in mammals, where it can be triggered either by extrinsic ligands binding to death receptors on the cell surface, or by intrinsic stimuli acting at the level of mitochondrial membrane integrity . these pathways enable the activation of caspases, a class of cysteine aspartyl proteases, and these bring about the orderly destruction of the cell.fig.  <dig> the involvement of caspases and bcl- <dig> family proteins in the apoptotic pathways of mammals. a apoptosis can be triggered either by extrinsic ligands binding to death receptors on the cell surface, or by intrinsic stimuli acting at the level of mitochondrial membrane integrity. these pathways enable the activation of caspases, a class of cysteine aspartyl proteases, and these bring about the orderly destruction of the cell. the present study indicates that the coral apoptotic system is vertebrate-like, comprising components of both extrinsic and intrinsic cell death pathways . b the mammalian bcl- <dig>  protein family contains both pro- and anti-apoptotic members. multi-domain bcl- <dig> ‘effectors’  mediate mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization  while the ‘anti-apoptotic’ multi-domain family members  inhibit it. bh3-only proteins share only the third bcl homology  domain with other members of the bcl- <dig> family, and regulate the other two classes either by directly activating the pro-apoptotic effectors  or by disrupting existing anti-apoptotic complexes without directly causing momp . c structure of the mammalian candidates for the direct activators , the derepressors/sensitizers , the effectors  and the anti-apoptotic  bcl- <dig> components. b and c are modified from moldoveanu et al.  <cit> . abbreviations: apaf- <dig>  apoptotic peptidase-activating factor 1; caspase, cysteine-dependent aspartyl-specific protease; card, caspase recruitment domain; cyt-c, cytochrome c; c-flip, cellular flice-like inhibitory protein; dd, death domain; ded, death effector domain; fadd, fas-associated death domain protein; tm, transmembrane



in mammals, a suite of caspases is present, members of which have a variety of specialized roles that are to some extent reflected in domain structure. the mammalian caspases are classified into three groups based on their domain architecture:  those that contain only the catalytic domain  are generally downstream effector caspases, such as caspases− <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig> and −14;  those that also contain a tandem pair of death effector domains  are initiator caspases, such as caspases- <dig> and −10; and  those that also contain a caspase activation and recruitment domain  are either initiator caspases involved in the intrinsic pathway,  and − <dig> ), or those involved in activating pro-inflammatory cytokines; caspases− <dig>  − <dig> − <dig>  − <dig>  and − <dig>  <cit> .

members of the bcl- <dig> protein family are key regulators of apoptotic cell death in mammals; some prevent apoptosis, whereas others are pro-apoptotic . although the older literature suggested that the anti- and pro- apoptotic bcl- <dig> proteins could be distinguished on the basis of bcl- <dig> homology  domain architecture  <cit> , this view is no longer tenable, as it is now recognized that several pro-apoptotic proteins share with their anti-apoptotic counterparts the presence of  <dig> bh domains and a similar overall  structure  <cit> . bcl- <dig> family members have a variety of modes of action. during apoptosis, conformational changes in the pro-apoptotic proteins bax  and bak  generate oligomeric forms that are capable of making the outer mitochondrial membrane permeable, resulting in release of cytochrome c , which binds to the scaffold protein apaf- <dig>  and ultimately activates effector caspases . many anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> proteins act by binding to activated bax or bak, and preventing their oligomerisation; alternatively anti-apoptotic activity may be imposed by bcl- <dig> proteins sequestering the ligands that drive activation of bax or bak  <cit> .

there are some similarities between the apoptotic systems of mammals and those of the model invertebrates drosophila and caenorhabditis, but the extrinsic apoptotic pathway is not present in either of these latter, and the intrinsic pathways differ in some critical respects and are considerably less complex. rather than controlling the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, in both organisms bcl- <dig> proteins are thought to act primarily at the level of the apoptosome. caenorhabditis ced- <dig>  the sole multi-domain bcl- <dig> protein present, functions by sequestering the apaf- <dig> homolog , thus inhibiting apoptosis. buffy, one of the two bcl- <dig> family members in drosophila, is thought to act in a similar manner, the pro-apoptotic bcl- <dig> protein debcl potentially relieving this inhibition by dimerising with buffy  <cit> . caspase- <dig>  the key player in the extrinsic cell-death pathway, is an evolutionarily ancient molecule  <cit> , but has been lost in the case of caenorhabiditis, as have death receptors and fadd . surveys of the available whole genome sequences suggest that the simplicity of the apoptotic networks of drosophila and caenorhabditis is unlikely to reflect the ancestral condition. it is unclear, however, how far back in evolution control of mitochondrial permeability by bcl- <dig> proteins was in place.

apoptosis has remained less well studied in other invertebrates, although studies on the hydrozoan cnidarians hydra magnipapillata  and hydractinia echinata  indicate the presence of complex repertoires of apoptotic proteins. corals  have been a major focus of attention due to interest in the possible roles of apoptosis in coral “bleaching”.

a common response of corals to many different stresses, or combinations of stresses, is to bleach, where bleaching is defined as the loss of their endosymbiotic symbiodinium or the loss by them of their photosynthetic pigments. the most widespread cause of bleaching recognized at present is overheating, as a result of global warming. a widely accepted theory is that bleaching is due to reactive oxygen species generated by photo-oxidative damage  <cit> , but while that may be a partial explanation, it is not the whole story, as corals also bleach when heated in the dark  <cit> . if photooxidative damage were indeed the main cause of apoptosis then symbiodinium loss could be a means of reducing the degree of damage, but presumably if the damage was too severe then the caspase cascade would continue. tchernov et al.  <cit>  explain the delay between loss of symbionts and cell death by speculating that after the loss of symbionts ros levels continue to rise as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction. kvitt et al.  <cit>  carried out detailed cell biological and molecular studies that led them to the following scenario for corals that ultimately survive thermal stress. firstly there was an initial onset of apoptosis which was accompanied by activation of anti-oxidant/anti-apoptotic mediators that blocked progression of apoptosis to other cells. this was followed by “acclimatization of the coral to the chronic thermal stress alongside the completion of symbiosis breakdown”. pernice et al.  <cit>  proposed a similar progression, with an initial burst of caspase-mediated apoptosis, followed by a delayed bcl-mediated protective response in response to heat stress.

despite the recent interest in apoptosis in corals, few studies have focused specifically on the apoptotic machinery of anthozoans. dunn et al.  <cit>  discussed the genes involved in apoptosis in the sea anemone, aiptasia, and a preliminary survey of apoptotic components of nematostella vectensis has been carried out  <cit> .

characterization of the apoptotic machinery of corals is important because it can not only provide novel evolutionary perspectives, but also lead to a much better understanding of the roles of apoptosis in coral bleaching and stress responses. because reef-building corals are difficult to maintain in aquaria, to date many of the studies aimed at understanding coral cell death as a result of bleaching have instead used the sea anemones aiptasia or anemonia as surrogates; not only are these hardy and simple to culture, but they also host the same genus of photosynthetic symbionts as corals. in one of the few papers to directly address coral apoptosis at a molecular level, tchernov et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the pan-caspase inhibitor zvad-fmk inhibited heat induced apoptosis and bleaching in pocillopora damicornis and montipora capitata. a number of bcl- <dig>  caspase or other apoptosis-related genes have been identified in corals using candidate gene , microarray , transcriptomic  or genomic  <cit>  approaches. however, studies to date have been piecemeal rather than comprehensive. despite the lack of complete surveys of caspase or bcl- <dig> repertoires, it is clear that the apoptotic pathways of corals are more complex than are those of the model invertebrates caenorhabditis and drosophila, and are probably more like those of vertebrates. tnfα-induced apoptosis has recently been reported in acropora  <cit> , unequivocally demonstrating the operation of the extrinsic cell death pathway, and the acropora caspase- <dig> and fadd proteins have been shown to interact  <cit> , suggesting some fundamental similarities between the apoptotic networks of corals and mammals. caspases are also present in corals, but of these only the caspase- <dig> ortholog has been characterized  <cit> . a number of bcl- <dig> family members, nominally identified as corresponding to bcl- <dig> , and the pro-apoptotic proteins bax  and bak  have previously been reported from acropora. however, until now there has not been a systematic study of the bcl- <dig> complement of any coral and no functional data are available for any of the coral bcl- <dig> family members.

in a recent comparison of acute  and longer-term  responses of the coral acropora millepora to co2-induced ocean acidification  <cit> , we found that a suite of bcl- <dig> genes was up-regulated in the longer-term exposure. our efforts to understand the functional significance of this response led to the present study, in which we characterize the multi-domain bcl- <dig> and caspase gene repertoires of a. millepora, and place these in an evolutionary context. with the identification of most or all of the repertoires of coral bcl- <dig> and caspases, our results not only provide new perspectives on the evolution of apoptotic pathways, but also a framework for future experimental studies towards a complete understanding of coral bleaching mechanisms.

RESULTS
the acropora bcl- <dig> repertoire
searching the a. millepora transcriptome  <cit>  by a combination of hmm  and blastp analyses led to the identification of  <dig> candidate clusters for the bcl- <dig> protein family. transcript clusters were consolidated on the basis of sequence similarity and reference to a. millepora genome data , leading us to identify  <dig> unique multi-domain members of the bcl- <dig> family . each of the previously identified bcl- <dig> family members was clearly represented, and similar numbers of bcl- <dig> family proteins were identified in the genomes of a. digitifera and n. vectensis . to facilitate establishing orthology relationships, bayesian inference and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were conducted on an alignment of the conserved bh domains; these results are summarized in fig.  <dig> . note that a number of the known hydra members of this family  <cit>  are highly divergent, so the entire hydra complement was excluded from this analysis. as can be seen in fig.  <dig>  the true vertebrate bcl- <dig> proteins formed a strongly supported clade that was clearly distinct from all of the cnidarian sequences.table  <dig> the acropora millepora repertoire of bcl- <dig> family proteins

a combination of hmm and blastp analyses was used on the a. millepora transcriptome and genome and led to the identification of  <dig> multi-domain members of the bcl- <dig> family. each of the previously identified bcl- <dig> family members was clearly represented and the corresponding genbank accession numbers are shown in italic in third column: ho <dig>  <cit> , dy <dig>  <cit> , ez <dig>  and ez <dig>  <cit> . probable orthologs in a. digitifera and n. vectensis are shown in column  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. scanning for the presence of a c-terminal transmembrane domain was carried out using the tmpred  and phobius  prediction software. mitochondrial association was inferred from expression in mammalian cells and subsequent subcellular localization . activity data are based on assays for pro- and anti-apoptotic assays after expression in mammalian cells ; parentheses indicate predicted activity where this has not yet been tested empirically. in the case of ambclrambo , results were equivocal; although pro-apoptotic activity was not directly tested, no major loss of cell viability was observed upon expression of full-length protein in mammalian cells . note that, although the properties of ambak were not tested, the orthologous protein from another cnidarian  has pro-apoptotic activity when expressed in mammalian cells  <cit> . assignments  are based on phylogenetic analysis of bcl- <dig> proteins . abbreviations: er, endoplasmic reticulum; nt, non-tested; tm, transmembrane

a number of coral proteins clustered with specific sub-families of vertebrate bcl- <dig> proteins , these associations often enjoying strong bootstrap support . for some other coral sequences, orthology relationships were equivocal. in the case of a. millepora ammcl1-like, bayesian analysis suggested a relationship with the vertebrate mcl <dig>  type, but this grouping was less well supported in maximum likelihood  analysis  and, for this reason, this coral sequence is subsequently referred to as mcl1-like. of the vertebrate bcl- <dig> proteins, four a. millepora sequences were most similar to the bcl2-l2/bclw type based on alignment , and hence are referred to here as ambclwa, ambclwb, ambclwc and ambclwd.

the acropora ambclwa protein  is expressed during larval development and has also been shown to be up-regulated after 9-day exposure to 750 ppm pco <dig>  <cit> . in phylogenetic analysis based on the bh domains, ambclwa and another a. millepora sequence  fall into a clade consisting exclusively of cnidarian sequences ; both of these a. millepora bcl- <dig> proteins have clear orthologs in a. digitifera and n. vectensis , and the latter is orthologous with g8xqy <dig> from stylophora pistillata. contrary to a previous report, the putative “bax” identified in ainsworth et al.  <cit>   has a full complement of bh domains and, based on its similarity to the human bclw as well as the present phylogenetic analysis , is likely to be anti- rather than pro-apoptotic. this was confirmed by expression in mammalian cells . on the basis of our analyses, a. millepora ambax is the true coral ortholog of mammalian bax; like the latter, it lacks a bh <dig> domain . the ambax protein was previously  identified by pernice et al.  <cit>  as the acropora bax ortholog , but this sequence was also incorrectly referred to as eu <dig> in the first table of that paper. the analyses presented here also confirm that ez <dig>  <cit>  encodes a full-length bak-type protein  which also lacks a bh <dig> domain.

three of the acropora bcl- <dig> family proteins  cluster with the vertebrate bok  proteins and, like them, appear to lack the c-terminal transmembrane region typical of most bcl- <dig> proteins .

anti-apoptotic properties of acropora bcl- <dig> family members
to better understand their in vivo functions, coral bcl- <dig> family members were expressed in mammalian cells and their ability to suppress apoptosis assessed.

in mammalian cells, the extrinsic cell-death pathway involves cleavage of the bh3-only protein bid  by caspase- <dig>  the resulting truncated version of the protein  triggers activation of pro-apoptotic proteins which permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane, releasing cytochrome c  <cit> . in human hela cells, it has been shown that bid is cleaved in response to extrinsic apoptotic stimuli and its truncated form is targeted to the mitochondria  <cit> . the anti-apoptotic activity of bcl- <dig> family members resides in their ability to prevent pro-apoptotic bcl- <dig> proteins inserting into mitochondrial membranes. the ability of coral bcl- <dig> family members to protect against tbid-triggered apoptosis was examined by transfecting hela cells simultaneously with distinct constructs encoding each enhanced green fluorescent protein -bcl- <dig> construct , txlbid , and mcherry . note that mcherry is required to allow visualization of intact transfected cells even at lower transfection efficiency , as the egfp fused with coral bcl- <dig> proteins was insufficient for monitoring at low magnification . in addition, the co-expression of tx1bid showed death inducing activity in transfected cells because no fluorescent-positive cells were observed . the expression of coral proteins in hela cells was confirmed by immunoblot analysis . as can be seen in fig. 3a, on the basis of this assay, four of the five a. millepora bcl- <dig> family members, including that initially identified as a  bax ortholog  <cit>  , provided comparable levels of protection relative to that conferred by mouse bcl-xl, mmbclxl, a well-characterized anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> family member .fig.  <dig> protection assay of a. millepora bcl- <dig> family proteins in response to extrinsic apoptotic stimuli. a protection assay of coral bcl- <dig> family proteins transfected in human hela cells against bid-induced apoptosis. plasmid constructs encoding a. millepora bcl- <dig> family proteins , which were fused with egfp, and an anti-apoptotic mouse bcl-xl protein, mmbclxl, and the pcag-mcherry plasmid were co-transfected into hela cells with or without pcs2-txlbid, which encodes a potent apoptotic inducer, txlbid. after 2 days of growth, cultures were washed to remove floating cells, and then fixed; viability was determined by monitoring mcherry-positive cells. both phase-contrast and red fluorescence images were captured for each field under the microscope. scale bars represent 100 μm. b a summary of the apoptosis protection assays. the numbers of mcherry-positive transfected and untransfected cells were counted at three distinct areas of each sample plate under the microscope, and the percentages of mcherry-positive cells to total cells were calculated. the number in parentheses indicates the ratio of the plasmid mixture. data are presented as the means and standard deviations of samples counted from three independent experiments. an asterisk indicates p <  <dig>  



investigating the pro-apoptotic activity of acropora bax and bok proteins
a subset of coral bcl- <dig> family members  was tested for pro-apoptotic activity by expression in hela cells, and the results are summarized as fig.  <dig>  expression of the coral bax ortholog  caused a large decrease in the number of viable cells  and this effect was partially mitigated by co-expression of anti-apoptotic mouse bcl-xl . however, in this assay system the coral bok protein  lacked significant pro-apoptotic activity . against expectations, the data showed the enhancement of viable activity of transfected cells in the presence of amboka. this suggests that in cultured cells, coral amboka may function like human bcl-xl, which is able to enhance transient gene expression and cell viability  <cit> .fig.  <dig> assessment of the pro-apoptotic activity of a. millepora ambax and amboka proteins. a cytotoxicity of coral ambax and amboka proteins in human hela cells. plasmid constructs encoding the a. millepora ambax or amboka proteins and the pcag-mcherry plasmid were co-transfected into hela cells with  or without  pegfp/mmbclxl. the number in parentheses indicates the ratio of the plasmid mixture. after 2 days, cultures were washed to remove floating cells and then fixed; viability was determined by monitoring mcherry-positive cells. both phase-contrast and red fluorescence images were captured for each microscope field. scale bars represent 100 μm. b, c summary of cytotoxicity assays. after cultivation, transfected cells were harvested and lysed, and then fluorescence absorbance due to mcherry in each cell extract was estimated based on fluorescence intensity. data are presented as the means and standard deviations of three independent experiments. an asterisk indicates p <  <dig>  



subcellular localization of acropora bcl- <dig> proteins
the c-terminal regions of most mammalian bcl- <dig> proteins contain an α-helical transmembrane  region that not only targets the proteins to the outer mitochondrial membrane, but also serves as an anchoring device. the tmpred  and phobius  software predicted the presence of corresponding tm motifs in most, but not all, of the coral bcl- <dig> proteins , the exceptions being the three coral bok proteins.

for a subset of the coral bcl- <dig> proteins, subcellular localization was examined after expression of egfp-bcl- <dig> fusion proteins in hela cells ; in the case of the coral bax protein, which has strong pro-apoptotic activity , subcellular localization experiments were carried out in hela cells that were co-expressing the  xenopus bcl-xl protein . as can be seen in fig. 5a, for each of the eight coral bcl- <dig> proteins examined, fluorescence associated with the egfp-bcl- <dig> fusion protein overlapped that associated with the mitochondrial marker, dsred-mito, confirming association with mitochondria.fig.  <dig> subcellular localization of a. millepora bcl- <dig> family proteins. a, b plasmid constructs encoding a. millepora bcl- <dig> family proteins fused with egfp and plasmids encoding mcherry as a marker to visualize organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum  and golgi apparatus, were transiently co-transfected. in the expression of pro-apoptotic ambax and amboka, the flag/xlbclxl protein was co-expressed to prevent apoptosis of the transfected cells. after 2 days of cultivation, cells were washed and fixed. both green and red fluorescent images of transfected cells were acquired using confocal microscopy and also merged into one image, resulting in an orange color in areas of co-expression. scale bars represent 10 μm



mammalian bok is an atypical bcl- <dig> family member in that it has only a weakly hydrophobic c-terminal tm region and a significant proportion of the bok protein is associated with membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus  <cit> . as noted above, each of the three coral bok proteins likewise either lack or have a relatively weak c-terminal tm domain, which led us to investigate whether a representative of this group  might be distributed like its mammalian counterparts. as can be seen in fig. 5b, when an egfp-coral_boka fusion protein was overexpressed in hela cells, egfp-fluorescence was associated not only with mitochondria, but also with the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus, confirming that  coral boka localizes like its mammalian counterparts.

the acropora caspase repertoire
using a combination of blastp and hmm  search strategies, and then eliminating obvious cases of redundancy,  <dig> clusters likely to correspond to  <dig> caspase loci were retrieved from the a. millepora transcriptome . phylogenetic analysis of these based on caspase domain sequences  revealed that, whereas some of the anthozoan proteins grouped with particular vertebrate caspase classes , in many cases relationships between cnidarian sequences and the well-defined caspase types of vertebrates were equivocal.table  <dig> the acropora millepora repertoire of caspases.

acropora caspases with n-terminal interaction domains
as indicated above, the vertebrate initiator caspases are distinguished from the effector caspases by the presence of n-terminal domains that mediate interactions with other components of the apoptotic machinery. in the bayesian analysis , a. millepora amcaspase  <dig> and its orthologs from a. digitifera and n. vectensis are the basal group within a large clade composed of the vertebrate caspase- <dig>  caspase- <dig>  cellular flice-like inhibitory protein  and a large group of uniquely cnidarian sequences; note that vertebrate members of this clade are paralogs  <cit> . the amcaspase  <dig> protein resembles vertebrate caspase- <dig> in containing two n-terminal death domains  that can interact homotypically with the coral fadd ortholog  <cit> . despite differing from bilaterian caspase- <dig> proteins at specific amino acid positions in the catalytic pocket, analysis of substrate specificity indicates that the coral amcaspase  <dig> protein is functionally homologous with vertebrate caspase- <dig>  <cit> .

like the other vertebrate initiator caspases, several other acropora caspases have n-terminal card  domains . however, molecular phylogenetics is of only limited value in predicting likely functional relationships between coral and mammal proteins . for example, one of the coral card-caspases  groups with the vertebrate effector caspases  with strong support under both bayesian and ml analyses. moreover, there is no consistent relationship between phylogenetics based on the caspase domain and protein domain structure – coral proteins with similar caspase domains sometimes differ with respect to presence / absence of card domains .

a novel class of caspase in acropora
the protein type referred to here as caspase-x was first recognized in a cdna clone . this clone encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acid residues that differs at a single residue  from the predicted protein product of the a. millepora amcaspase xa locus; presumably these represent alleles.

four of the a. millepora caspases  are atypical in that they contain two caspase domains, the first of which is predicted to be inactive in each case . as can be seen in fig. 7b and the sequence alignment shown as additional file 5a, the second caspase domain in each of these proteins is typical in all respects , whereas the first caspase-like region is atypical, lacking the catalytic histidine and cysteine residues, and is therefore predicted to be inactive. in phylogenetic analyses , these a. millepora atypical caspases clustered together with seven sequences retrieved from the a. digitifera protein predictions. each of these seven a. digitifera sequences likewise contained the basic double  caspase domain structure; one of the predictions  is atypical in having four caspase domains and a glycosyl-transferase domain, and another  also has a glycosyl-transferase domain.fig.  <dig> characteristics of a. millepora caspase-x. a a schematic diagram of the a. millepora caspase-x protein. the pseudo protease domain, casc*, and a protease domain, casc, are indicated by blue and red boxes, respectively. abbreviation: casc, caspase, interleukin- <dig> β converting enzyme homologues. b the alignments of amino acid sequences of casc* and casc motifs of a. millepora caspase-x with that of human c-flip and caspase- <dig> proteins. identical and similar amino acids in the motifs are shown in red and blue, respectively. the histidine and cysteine residues outlined by red boxes are crucial amino acids for protease activity, whereas the amino acid residues outlined by blue boxes indicate the exchanged amino acids from histidine and cysteine. c the numbers indicate the percentage identity and similarity between two domains, respectively



the sister clade to the “double caspase” clade consists of two sequences from each of the two acropora species; these are “normal”  caspases with characteristics consistent with catalytic activity.

to examine the functional activity of caspase-x, a fusion protein, flag/caspx, was generated based on cdna clone d038-a <dig> , and transiently expressed in hela cells . a significant difference with regard to number of mcherry-positive cells was recognized in the presence and absence of flag/caspx, indicating the ability of caspase-x to induce a degree of cell death. to test the idea that the first protease-like casc* domain might regulate the activity of the second casc domain, a truncated form, flag/caspxΔn, containing only the second domain was generated , and expressed in hela cells   <cit> . this casc-only construct caused a further decrease in the number of mcherry-positive transfected cells, but a tendency towards recovery was observed upon co-expression of baculovirus p <dig> protein, which is a pan-caspase inhibitor . these cytological observations are summarized in fig. 8c, and lead us to conclude that caspase-x has significant pro-apoptotic protease activity and that the activity of the casc domain is negatively regulated by the presence of the casc* domain. to better understand the relationship between the first casc* and the second casc domains, a three-dimensional structural model was generated . the structure consisting of the casc* and cas domains of caspase-x clearly resembles that of the heterocomplex of human c-flip casc* domain and procaspase- <dig> casc domain   <cit> . as in the c-flip/procaspase- <dig> structure, the primary interface between the two domains in caspase-x is through anti-parallel association of the β6-strands in both domains. the magnified stereo view shows that several amino acids in the α <dig> helix and β <dig> sheets of the two caspase-x domains are likely to interact with each other , again as in the c-flip/procaspase- <dig> structure  <cit> .fig.  <dig> functional activity of caspase-x. a a schematic diagram of constructs. flag/caspx and flag/caspxΔn are flag-tagged molecules consisting of intact or truncated caspase-x. b cytotoxicity assays of human hela cells expressing caspase-x and its truncated forms. plasmid constructs encoding flag/caspx or flag/caspxΔn and the pcag-mcherry plasmid were co-transfected into hela cells in the presence or absence of baculovirus p <dig>  which is a pan-caspase inhibitor. after 2 days of growth, cultures were washed to remove floating cells, and then fixed; viability was determined by monitoring mcherry-positive cells. both phase-contrast and red fluorescence images were captured for each field under the microscope. scale bars represent 100 μm. c a summary of cytotoxicity assays on caspase-x. after cultivation, transfected cells were harvested and lysed in the lysis buffer for the preparation of cell extracts. fluorescence absorbance of mcherry in each cell extract was measured and viability of transfected cells was indicated by fluorescent intensity. the number in parentheses indicates the ratio of the plasmid mixture. data are presented as the means and standard deviations of samples counted from four independent experiments , and are expressed relative to the empty vector  value. an asterisk indicates p <  <dig>

discussion
the core apoptotic machinery of acropora appears to be of comparable complexity to that of other cnidarians. we reported here  <dig> bcl- <dig> and  <dig> caspase family members in a. millepora. the bcl- <dig> and caspase repertoires of the sea anemone n. vectensis and the freshwater hydrozoan h. magnipapillata have been surveyed, revealing similar levels of complexity to those reported here for acropora. nine bcl- <dig> family members have been identified in hydra, including two bak-like and seven bcl-2-like proteins  <cit> , whereas eleven family members were reported in nematostella, including members of the pro-apoptotic subfamilies bax, bak and bok  <cit> . fifteen caspases have been reported in hydra, five of which are likely to be initiators based on the presence of n-terminal ded, card or death domains   <cit> . the zmasek et al.  <cit>  survey identified  <dig> caspases in nematostella.

most of the multi-domain pro-apoptotic bcl- <dig> family members  known from vertebrates are clearly represented in the coral and sea anemone. consistent with conservation of function, the coral bax ortholog  associated with mitochondria when expressed in mammalian cells, and displayed strong pro-apoptotic activity . a cnidarian bak protein also has pro-apoptotic activity when expressed in mammalian cells  <cit> . however, although mammalian bcl2l13/bcl-rambo was identified as a pro-apoptotic molecule  <cit> , overexpression of coral ambcl-rambo did not induce cell death; a high proportion of cells are viable when expressing this protein fused to egfp , indicating that ambcl-rambo does not have strong pro-apoptotic activity in mammalian cells. the mammalian bok proteins are usually referred to as pro-apoptotic, but neither function nor mechanism is clear. the acropora genome encodes at least three distinct bok-related proteins, and in a number of respects these resemble their vertebrate counterparts. the mammalian bok locus encodes a complete set of four bh domains , as do two  of the three coral bok transcripts. one distinctive feature of mammalian boks is that the c-terminal domain, which in the case of other bcl- <dig> family members encodes a tm domain that serves as a tail-anchor for the mitochondrial membrane, is weakly, rather than strongly, hydrophobic. the putative coral boks share this characteristic; for each of the three acropora bok-related proteins, both tmpred and phobius predict either the complete absence  or the presence of only a weak  c-terminal tm domain. mammalian bok appears to be targeted to the golgi and endoplasmic reticulum  membranes in addition to the mitochondrial membrane  <cit> , and this appears also to be the case with the coral bok protein tested .

whereas several of the coral bcl- <dig> proteins appear to be orthologs of specific pro-apoptotic bcl- <dig> proteins from mammals, relationships of the anti-apoptotic acropora bcl- <dig> proteins, including ammcl1-like, are more ambiguous. note that, although bayesian analysis suggests orthology of this coral sequence with vertebrate mcl <dig> proteins , this grouping has limited support under ml . phylogenetics based on protease domain sequences was likewise of limited usefulness in establishing relationships between the coral and vertebrate caspase types , and was sometimes inconsistent with predictions based on domain structure. for example, phylogenetics  groups amcaspase cardb with the vertebrate caspase-3/6/ <dig> type . however, this sequence resembles initiator caspases in encoding a card domain in addition to the caspase domain.

although their phylogenetic relationships are not yet clear, the caspase-x proteins are distinguished by the presence of two predicted caspase domains, the n-terminal of which is inactive because it lacks the active site cys and his residues . the human c-flip protein, which likewise has an inactive protease domain, down-regulates the activity of caspase- <dig> for processing of most apoptotic substrates in the heterodimer complex but is able to enhance the processing of non-apoptotic substrates, such as hdac- <dig> , by caspase- <dig>  <cit> . although the significance of the unique domain structure of caspase-x is unknown, it may work by forming a complex with a second active domain to cleave specific substrates, as in the case of the c-flip and caspase- <dig> complex . caspase-x proteins may be restricted to corals, as we were able to identify clearly related proteins encoded by the a. digitifera genome, but not by the genomes of nematostella or other cnidarians. the domain structure of caspase-x proteins also appears to be unique. searching the national center for biotechnology information  non-redundant  database revealed some predicted proteins containing more than one caspase domain, often in combination with other  domains, but these entries have not been verified, whereas in the case of a. millepora caspase-x, cdnas have been isolated.

the present study was conducted in order to better understand the implications of a recent analysis of the responses of the coral acropora millepora to co2-induced ocean acidification  <cit> . five distinct bcl- <dig> genes were up-regulated in the longer-term  exposure, but it was unclear whether they coded for pro- or anti-apoptotic proteins. based on the present study,  <dig> of the  <dig> up-regulated bcl-2 s have anti-apoptotic properties, indicating that suppression of apoptosis is a key component of coral acclimation to elevated pco <dig>  the fifth bcl- <dig>  is predicted to be pro-apoptotic but, as mentioned above, no major loss of viability was observed upon expression of the coral protein in mammalian cells, leaving this prediction unconfirmed.

suppression of apoptosis  was previously proposed to be involved in coral resistance to bleaching by acting as a regulator of oxidative stress generated by symbionts  <cit> . the juvenile corals used by moya et al.  <cit>  were free of symbionts but an antioxidant enzyme, catalase, was up-regulated together with bcl- <dig> proteins in the longer-term pco <dig> treatment, suggesting potential oxidative stress even in the absence of symbionts. together, those results suggest that suppression of apoptosis might play a major role in the ability of corals to acclimate to environmental stresses.

CONCLUSIONS
along with the quistad et al.  <cit>  paper, the data presented here and elsewhere  <cit>  indicate that the extrinsic apoptotic pathway is present in acropora, whereas both drosophila and caenorhabditis have lost this. moreover, although the intrinsic apoptotic pathways in the fly and worm are highly diverged, the coral system appears to be more vertebrate-like, as is the case for many other genome characteristics of cnidarians  <cit> . thus the apoptotic network of the eumetazoan common ancestor was complex, and the fly and worm have derived their specialized versions from this. the extent of gene loss and divergence that has clearly occurred in the case of the apoptotic network in the model ecdysozoans has numerous precedents; for example, both the fly and worm have lost the cpg  methylation system despite this being an ancestral characteristic  <cit> .

although there are clear functional parallels with mammals, a number of important issues remain to be resolved. characterization of the bh3-only protein repertoire is of particular importance, but is likely to be challenging given the lack of sequence conservation typical of these molecules. the available data imply that in the coral, as in mammals, multi-domain bcl- <dig> proteins modulate release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, allowing the assembly of the apoptosome, which also contains apaf- <dig> and the apoptotic initiator, caspase- <dig>  lange et al.  <cit>  have previously reported the identification of the acropora apaf- <dig> homolog , but the counterpart of caspase- <dig> is less clear – at this time, the best candidate appears to be encoded by the a. millepora amcaspase carda, but this remains to be confirmed. likewise, the identity of the coral death receptor  and whether the signal from this complex can be amplified via the intrinsic pathway are as yet unknown. although functional analyses are not yet possible in the coral system, hydra and the sea anemone nematostella - both well-established laboratory animals - are more tractable. along with corals, these simple animals can therefore tell us a great deal more about the origins and evolution of mammalian apoptotic pathways.
