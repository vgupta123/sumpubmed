BACKGROUND
tumor cells are characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation resulting in abnormal and accelerated tissue growth. in contrast, “healthy” cells often proliferate with a division rate of ~ <dig> h  <cit> . this is due to the direct control of cell cycle checkpoints by the intracellular circadian clock machinery  <cit> .

circadian clocks operate in most tissues at the single-cell level  <cit> . at the molecular level, these clocks are based on clock genes, which participate in auto-regulatory feedback loops. in the core loop, the transcription factors clock and bmal <dig> activate the expression of per and cry genes, whose protein products negatively feed back on their own expression  <cit> . several additional feedback loops contribute to this canonical mechanism, including one involving the nuclear receptor nr1d <dig>  moreover, in any given cell type, 5–20% of the transcriptome is under circadian control  <cit> . this is the basis for circadian control of major physiological processes, including immune functions and, most importantly for this investigation, cell proliferation  <cit> .

misalignment between the external and internal time and circadian disruption, such as during shift work, has been associated with an increased cancer risk  and promotes tumor growth . moreover, circadian clock alteration due to mutations of single clock genes, such as per <dig> or bmal <dig>  accelerates tumor growth  <cit>  or the whole carcinogenesis process . this is putatively due to an increase in proliferation rate upon circadian rhythm disruption, because tumor suppressor and key cell cycle genes are under clock control  <cit>  in the context of a bidirectional clock–cell cycle coupling  <cit> . in support of the connection between rhythm disruption and oncogenesis, deregulated circadian rhythms appear to be a common feature of cancer cell lines  <cit>  and advanced-stage tumors  <cit> . moreover, in mouse models of tumorigenesis, the outcome of the disease correlates with the level of improvement of circadian rhythmicity  <cit> . intriguingly, cancer prognosis and survival has been associated with the level of circadian disruption in patient tumor tissues  <cit> . although a previous study suggested a role for the circadian clock within cancer cells in tumor growth  <cit> , direct evidence has been missing. here, we show that improving circadian rhythms in the tumor slows down cell cycle progression and strongly reduces proliferation and tumor growth.

methods
study design
the general objective of the study was to investigate the role of the tumor cell-intrinsic circadian clock in relation to cell proliferation in culture and tumor growth in mice. for this purpose, we activated the circadian clock in b <dig> melanoma cells and subcutaneous  b <dig> tumors and compared cell cycle gene expression, cell cycle phase distribution and tumor growth after repeated dexamethasone  or phosphate-buffered saline  treatment under controlled laboratory experimental conditions. we repeated those experiments using control or bmal <dig> short hairpin rna -transfected b <dig> tumors as a model with an inducible or non-inducible circadian clock. in the in vitro experiments, other clock-enhancing treatments  were also used. further, we used nod-scid il2rgammanull  mice to exclude the possible role of dex on immune infiltration in the tumors. hct- <dig> cells and tumors were used to extend the data obtained from b <dig> melanoma cells to another cancer cell line, from human origin. in all animal experiments, mice were killed after 7– <dig> days of treatment and during the second day in constant darkness at the indicated circadian hours. the sample size could change during an experiment when the tumor size reached the previously defined clinical endpoint of individual mice and animals had to be killed. the sample size of all biological replicates per time point is indicated in each figure legend or the related tables , and mice were randomized between all groups. the study was not performed double-blinded: the experimenter was not blind to the identity of the animal in the different groups, because the treatment of each animal had to be performed according to the specific group. none of the animals was excluded from the analysis or the statistics.

cell culture and bioluminescence recordings
the b <dig> and hct- <dig> cell lines, developed from murine skin and human colonic carcinoma  <cit> , were obtained from drs hua gu  and dindial ramotar , respectively, and cultured using standard conditions. stable transfections with luciferase reporters were done according to standard procedures. more details can be found in the additional file  <dig>  all cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma. b <dig> cells express the glucocorticoid receptor  <cit>  and hsf <dig>  <cit> , the latter being relevant for circadian synchronization by heat shock  <cit> . hct- <dig> cells seem not to express functional glucocorticoid receptors  <cit> . however, steroids such as glucocorticoids can act through glucocorticoid receptor-independent pathways  <cit>  and the synchronization of circadian rhythms in hct- <dig> cells can be achieved by dex treatment  <cit> .

for whole-culture imaging, b <dig> cells or  <dig> μm slices of tumors from b <dig> cells with luciferase reporters were cultured in sealed dishes and recorded in a lumicycle luminometer . overall brightness was calculated by averaging values from  <dig> h after the start of recording to the end of recording. for single-cell imaging, b <dig> cells or b <dig> tumor slices were cultured under a microscope inside an incubator, and recorded using a charge-coupled device camera . images were collected at intervals of  <dig> min, with  <dig> min exposure duration. data were smoothed by a running minimum algorithm, and bioluminescence intensity was measured within a region of interest with a constant size, but defined manually for each moving cell. detailed conditions and data analysis can be found in additional file  <dig> 

shrna knockdown

bmal <dig> shrna or scrambled shrna lentiviral particles  consist of a pool of three constructs encoding 19– <dig> nt long target-specific shrna, or shrna with the same sequence composition, but scrambled. we ensured that the sequences of bmal <dig> shrnas were absent in the mouse genome. b <dig> cells were grown in 12-well plates until 50% confluency. the medium was replaced with antibiotic-free opti-mem medium with  <dig> μg/ml polybrene . cells were infected by the addition of 1 ×  <dig> infectious units of virus. after  <dig> h, the medium was replaced with regular growth medium. stable clones expressing the shrna were selected using puromycin  . all cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma.

proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle assays in vitro
to study proliferation, cell death and cell cycle, b <dig> and hct- <dig> cells were cultured until reaching 70% confluency and then stimulated with dex  or forskolin  . medium was replaced after  <dig> h. in different experiments, the cells were exposed to a heat shock of 43 °c for  <dig> min  <cit> . live and dead cells were counted using trypan blue, and apoptotic cells were assessed by annexin v staining. cell cycle phases were studied by bromodeoxyuridine  and 7-aminoactinomycin d  stainings, cell cycle phase distribution and cell cycle arrest were measured by ki <dig> and annexin v stainings, and mitotic index was assessed by phospho-histone h <dig>  staining, using standard protocols. more details can be found in additional file  <dig> 

animals, dex injections and tumor growth monitoring
c57bl/6j mice and nsg mice  were housed  under  <dig> h light : <dig> h dark  conditions with food and water available ad libitum. male mice  were used in all experiments, except for one experiment with shrna-expressing tumors to evaluate the tumor growth, in which 4-month-old females were used. the sample size of all biological replicates per time point is indicated in each figure legend or related supplementary table and mice were randomized between all groups.

c57bl/6j mice or nsg mice were inoculated with  <dig>  ×  <dig> b <dig> cells in the tail vein or subcutaneously or 3 ×  <dig> hct- <dig> cells. the s.c. tumor volume was measured in two dimensions with a caliper and calculated based on the volume of an ellipsoid. when s.c. tumors reached a volume of ~100 μl , dex  was injected intra-tumorally every second day at zeitgeber time   <dig>  to reach a concentration of 200 nm within the tumor . tumor growth was measured daily. tumor growth was compared showing absolute tumor volume when the tumors were on average 100 μl and did not differ between mice by more than approximately ± <dig> μl at the first treatment day. in case of experimental starting conditions when the tumor volume of mice differed more than 50 μl between individual mice at the first treatment day, the relative tumor growth was calculated relative to the initial starting volume for each individual mouse. mice were killed by cervical dislocation at the indicated circadian times  during the second day of darkness, 18– <dig> days after inoculation. eyes were removed under a 15 w red safety light prior to dissection. tumors and host organs were harvested and kept at − <dig> °c until further analysis.

cell cycle, immune cell labeling and protein expression assays on tumors
cell cycle phases were determined using brdu and 7aad staining. brdu  was injected intra-tumorally 6 h before tumors were collected. cell lysates from fixed s.c. tumors were incubated with mouse anti-brdu antibody and then with alexa fluor  <dig> goat anti-mouse igg. finally, cells were incubated with 7aad viability staining solution. mitotic index was evaluated on tumor cell lysate incubated with anti-phh <dig> antibody and then with alexa fluor  <dig> donkey anti-rabbit antibody. a second set of cell lysates were stained for annexin v. cell cycle arrest and proliferation was detected in cells from fixed s.c. tumors in nsg mice or in scrambled shrna and bmal <dig> shrna cultured cells using the ki <dig> set according to manufacturer’s protocol.

for tumor immune cell infiltration in vivo, tumors were collected throughout the circadian day  on the seventh day after the first dex treatment. one million cells from s.c. tumor suspensions with and without collagenase treatment were blocked with fc block and then incubated with first antibodies for t cells , b cells , dendritic cells , macrophages , neutrophils  or monocytes , followed by labeled streptavidin in the case of cd11b staining.

for protein expression in vivo, tumors were collected  and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 90% methanol, and incubated with antibodies for wee <dig>  c-myc, cyclin e , cdk <dig>  p <dig> , cdk <dig>  p <dig>  or bmal <dig> . after blocking with 10% rat or goat serum, appropriate secondary antibodies were used. controls for each sample were stained with the secondary antibody alone. finally, the cell suspensions were analyzed by flow cytometry.

all samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using a facs calibur  and flowjo software . controls for each sample were stained with the secondary antibody alone. more details can be found in additional file  <dig>  including panel descriptions, antibodies and fluorophores.

quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry
standard protocols were used to perform quantitative polymerase chain reaction  and immunohistochemistry. details about protocols, primer sequences, antibodies and data analysis can be found in additional file  <dig> 

statistical analysis
statistical analyses were done with graphpad prism . mann-whitney rank sum test  was used for knockdown efficiency. circadian variation was tested by fitting a cosine-wave equation, y=baseline+amplitude*cos2*π*x−phaseshift <dig>  


on clock gene expression or a double harmonic cosine-wave equation, y=baseline+amplitude1*cos2*π*x−phaseshift124+amplitude2*cos4*π*x−phaseshift <dig> 


on cell cycle gene expression data, with a fixed 24-h period; significance was determined using an f-test. for datasets with more than two time points, a kruskal-wallis test was used , taking the small sample size into consideration even if the normality test passed. for differences over time between two groups or more, two-way anova was used, followed by bonferroni’s posthoc test. a statistically significant difference was assumed when p <  <dig> . statistical details are presented in additional file  <dig> 

RESULTS
induction of circadian clock function in b <dig> melanoma cells
first we characterized circadian rhythm generation in b <dig> melanoma cells. reporter constructs consisting of the luciferase gene under the control of the bmal <dig> or the per <dig> promoter  were stably transfected in b <dig> cells. the bioluminescence of these cells was arrhythmic . however, upon addition of dex, an agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor  known to induce circadian rhythms in cultured cells, we observed rhythmic bmal1-luc and per2-luc promoter activity with the expected opposite phases   <cit> , which, however dampened earlier than in various non-cancer cell lines  <cit> .fig.  <dig> induction of rhythmic clock gene and cell cycle gene expression in b <dig> cells. a averaged bmal1-luc  or per2-luc  bioluminescence after dexamethasone  treatment of b <dig> cells. b

to address whether the loss of rhythmicity after a few cycles resulted from circadian dysfunction in individual cells or from a desynchronization among rhythmic cells, we analyzed per2-luc bioluminescence at the single-cell level . although rhythms in the circadian range  were induced by dex in ~90% of the cells, they quickly dampened within two to three cycles: 50% and 36% of the cells showed a second or third circadian peak, respectively, but circadian rhythms in bioluminescence were greatly suppressed in all cells after  <dig> h . similarly the amplitude of single-cell rhythms dropped by about 80% within three cycles and the phase distribution became dispersed after  <dig> h . repeated treatments showed that clock gene suppression was not due to cell death . overall, these data indicated a suppression of clock gene expression in b <dig> cells rather than a desynchronization between single cells.

rhythmic clock gene expression was also observed when employing alternative methods for clock gene activation  <cit> : fsk, an activator of adenylyl cyclase and of the camp/pka pathway , heat shock  and serum shock  all induced transcript oscillations in b <dig> cells. in addition to bmal <dig> and per <dig>  the mrnas of clock genes per <dig>  cry <dig> and nr1d <dig> also fluctuated rhythmically in b <dig> cells after dex treatment but not in untreated cells .

altogether, these results indicated that the b <dig> cells harbor an unstable but inducible circadian oscillator. we decided to take advantage of this property to address the role of the tumor cell-intrinsic clock in cell proliferation and tumor growth.

the cell cycle is under circadian control after dexamethasone treatment in vitro
because the molecular clockwork was shown to regulate the expression of genes encoding cell cycle regulators  <cit> , we set out to study the expression of such genes in b <dig> cells. b <dig> cells were treated with dex for  <dig> h, harvested over  <dig> h, and tested for mrna expression of wee  <dig> homolog  <dig> , cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig> , cdk <dig>  cyclin e, myelocytomatosis oncogene c  and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a . all six genes showed predominant 24-h rhythm components in transcript abundance as a consequence of dex treatment .

because these factors are involved in cell cycle checkpoints, we assessed the effect of dex treatment on the distribution of b <dig> cells among cell cycle stages. cells were collected at different time points over  <dig> h, stained for brdu incorporation and with 7aad, and analyzed by flow cytometry . the proportion of cells in g0/ <dig>  g2/m and s phases was found to be rhythmic in cells treated with dex, while control cells showed no circadian variation . interestingly, fewer cells entered the s phase  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h after dex treatment , indicating less dna replication, while more cells were found in g0/g <dig> phases .fig.  <dig> dexamethasone , forskolin  and heat shock treatments reduce b <dig> cell proliferation. a, b representative flow cytometry dot plots and c–e overall analysis for cell cycle phases in b <dig> cells 24– <dig> h after dex treatment , stained for incorporated brdu and with 7aad. significant rhythms are illustrated with fitted cosine curves, otherwise data are connected by straight lines between data points, indicating no significant circadian rhythms . f, g total alive cell numbers 12– <dig> h  and 48– <dig> h  after treatment with either dex or fsk and controls . h alive cell numbers 0– <dig> h after control or dex treatment at  <dig> h  or at  <dig> and  <dig> h  . i alive cell numbers 0– <dig> h after heat shock or control treatment . two-way anova, posthoc test, *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig>  for dex compared to controls; +++

induction of the circadian clock slows down b <dig> cell proliferation in vitro
given that activation of the circadian clock in b <dig> cells triggered rhythms of cell cycle genes and phases, we next tested whether activation of the clock in b <dig> cells influences their proliferation. thirty-six hours after dex treatment, we counted significantly fewer live cells than without treatment , while the amount of dead cells in the medium was unchanged after 12– <dig> h . the effect was even more pronounced after 2 days, with ~50% fewer live cells but similar numbers of dead cells after dex treatment . of note, the numbers of live and dead cells were similar before and immediately after the end of the  <dig> h dex treatment, suggesting that the treatment did not acutely induce cellular toxicity .

because rhythms quickly dampened after treatment  we tested whether repeated dex treatment could further inhibit cell proliferation. while a single dex treatment significantly reduced cell numbers after  <dig> h, a second treatment further reduced the amount of cells after  <dig> h . population doubling time  was increased to  <dig>  h in single dex-treated cells and further to  <dig>  h in double dex-treated cells compared to  <dig>  h pdt in untreated control cells. annexin v staining indicated that the differences in cell counts were not due to differences in levels of apoptosis . total cell numbers were even more reduced after three dex treatments administered every  <dig> h .

similar experiments were also conducted with other stimuli activating the b <dig> clock . both a single fsk treatment  and repeated fsk treatments  were as effective as dex in slowing down b <dig> cell proliferation. also, fsk treatment did not affect cell death rates , nor did it acutely impact on cell numbers right after the  <dig> h treatment . moreover, exposing the cells to a  <dig> min heat shock was sufficient to reduce proliferation without affecting apoptosis . pdt was increased to  <dig>  h after heat shock compared to  <dig>  h in untreated cells. these data suggested that the reduction in cell proliferation might be due to action on intrinsic clock function, as activating clock gene expression was the common denominator of all three treatments.

dexamethasone activates the circadian clock in b <dig> tumors
b <dig> melanoma cells, which represent a well-established and widely used mouse model for human melanoma  <cit> , form lung and s.c. tumors when injected in the tail vein and subcutaneously, respectively . the analysis of circadian clock gene expression in b <dig> lung tumors unveiled suppressed or arrhythmic per <dig>  per <dig> and bmal <dig> expression, while there was robust circadian oscillation in the neighboring lung tissue . similarly, per <dig>  per <dig>  bmal <dig> and nr1d <dig> expression was arrhythmic in s.c. b <dig> tumors .fig.  <dig> dexamethasone  injection induces rhythmic clock gene expression in b <dig> tumors in vivo.

dex, an agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor, is well known to reset cellular clocks by inducing per gene expression  <cit> . upon repeated addition of dex, we observed rhythmic bmal1-luciferase reporter expression in slice cultures of explanted b <dig> lung tumors . moreover, monitoring of single cells within the same lung tumor slice indicated an absence of bmal <dig> rhythms before treatment, but circadian oscillation of bmal <dig> after dex treatment . thus, dex induces de novo rhythmic bmal <dig> gene expression in single b <dig> cells rather than synchronizing cellular oscillators. this is consistent with the single-cell data obtained on b <dig> cells in vitro .

to further confirm an activation of the tumor clock by dex in vivo, s.c. tumors were injected intra-tumorally with dex every  <dig> h to ensure maintenance of tumor clock activation. rhythmic clock gene expression in tumors was found after dex but not pbs treatment . per <dig>  per <dig>  cry <dig> and nr1d <dig> expression showed a significant effect of time and treatment. rhythmicity of bmal <dig> mrna expression did not reach significance . however, the anova analysis showed an effect of time , and immunohistochemistry on s.c. tumor slices revealed a significant rhythm of bmal <dig> protein levels in dex-treated tumors, but not in pbs-treated tumors .

the efficiency and specificity of the intra-tumoral injections were evaluated by injecting methylene blue in tumors. the injected fluid spanned the whole tumor tissue  <dig> h after intra-tumoral injection, but was absent in surrounding tissues . to further assess the specificity of the response, clock gene expression in the liver - a non-cancerous, peripheral tissue - was compared between pbs- and dex-injected mice: we found no significant differences between the treatment groups .

altogether, these results indicated that the b <dig> tumors harbor a suppressed but inducible circadian oscillator. moreover, these experiments showed that repeated dex injection consistently induced rhythmic clock gene expression in b <dig> tumors rather than re-synchronized them. the ability to compare the b <dig> tumors with or without circadian clock function gave us the opportunity to test the role of the tumor-intrinsic clock in regulating cell cycle and tumor growth.

the cell cycle is under circadian control after dexamethasone treatment of b <dig> tumors
we measured the expression of cell cycle regulators in s.c. b <dig> tumors harvested over  <dig> h. similar to the data obtained in vitro , rhythmic protein expression of cyclin e, p <dig> and c-myc was found in dex-treated tumors, but not in pbs-treated tumors . on the other hand, wee <dig>  cdk <dig>  cdk <dig> and p <dig>  a direct glucocorticoid receptor target  <cit> , did not show a daily variation in the dex-treated tumors .fig.  <dig> dexamethasone  injection induces rhythmic cell cycle events and reduces b <dig> tumor growth in vivo.

homogenized tumor cells collected at different time points were stained for brdu incorporation and with 7aad. the proportion of cells in g0/ <dig> and s phases was found to be rhythmic in dex-treated control tumors, whereas pbs-treated tumors showed no circadian variation . interestingly, fewer rhythmic cells entered the s phase in dex-treated tumors, indicating less dna replication, whereas more cells were found in g0/g <dig> phases. importantly, dex treatment reduced rather than increased the number of cells in g <dig> arrest as indicated by ki67/7aad staining in vitro . consistent with results obtained from brdu stainings, cell numbers in g <dig> phase were increased, while cells distributed in s/g2/m phases were slightly reduced . thus, reduced cell numbers after dex treatment were not caused by cell cycle arrest. moreover, even though entrance to g2/m phase was not rhythmically controlled in the tumor, mitotic index assessed by phh <dig> staining indicated a rhythmic percentage of cells undergoing mitosis . interestingly, cells from dex-treated tumors underwent apoptosis in a circadian manner .

dexamethasone treatment slows down b <dig> tumor growth
given that activation of the circadian clock in b <dig> tumors triggered rhythms of cell cycle genes and phases, we then evaluated whether the activation of clock function in b <dig> tumors was paralleled by a reduction in tumor growth. to this end, s.c. b <dig> tumor growth was compared between dex- and pbs-treated tumors. dex treatment significantly slowed down tumor growth  compared to pbs treatment . importantly though, annexin v staining indicated that the differences in tumor growth were not due to differences in the levels of apoptosis, because a similar proportion of apoptotic cells were found in dex- and pbs-treated tumors .

to rule out that reduced tumor growth after dex treatment may be caused by dex-induced immune cell infiltration in the tumor, we repeated this experiment in immune-deficient nsg mice, which lack t cells, b cells and natural killer cells. similarly to results in c57bl/6j hosts, tumor growth was strongly reduced by dex in nsg mice , and no differences were found in the levels of infiltration of remaining immune cells between dex- and pbs-treated tumors in nsg mice . again, the proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis was not significantly different between dex- and pbs-treated tumors collected at circadian time  <dig> in nsg mice . moreover, the proportions of cells undergoing cell division  and of those in g <dig> arrest were unchanged by dex treatment of tumors in nsg mice . together with results obtained in vitro that excluded cell cycle arrest  and in c57bl/6j mice that showed more cells in g0/g <dig> phase at ct <dig> upon dex treatment, these results indicated that cells remain more in g <dig> phase and transit less to the s phase.

knockdown of bmal <dig> abolishes the effects of dexamethasone on clock genes and cell cycle genes
to test whether the activation of the clock in b <dig> tumors is the causal link between dex treatment and the inhibition of tumor growth, experiments were repeated in b <dig> tumors with a disrupted circadian clock. using a lentiviral vector, we stably introduced into b <dig> cells an shrna against bmal <dig>  a necessary component of the circadian clock  <cit> . bmal <dig> shrna-transfected cells expressed ~80% less bmal <dig> rna and ~65% less bmal <dig> protein than scrambled shrna control cells . b <dig> cells stably expressing shrna against bmal <dig> or scrambled shrna were injected subcutaneously into mice to form either tumors lacking a functional clock or control tumors. similarly to non-transfected tumors, clock gene expression showed significant circadian rhythms in dex-treated but not pbs-treated scrambled shrna tumors . in bmal <dig> shrna tumors, bmal <dig> expression was reduced by ~70% in both dex- and pbs-treated tumors . accordingly, the expression of bmal <dig> target genes per <dig>  per <dig>  cry <dig> and nr1d <dig> was suppressed and arrhythmic, indicating effective disruption of the clock machinery in the tumors . thus, bmal <dig> knockdown completely prevented the induction of circadian rhythms by dex in the bmal <dig> shrna tumors.fig.  <dig>

rhythmic gene expression of cyclin e, p <dig> and c-myc was only found in dex-treated scrambled shrna tumors; cdk <dig>  cdk <dig> and wee <dig> did not show a daily variation, in line with cell cycle protein data . importantly, abrogation of dex-induced activation of the circadian clock in bmal <dig> shrna tumors was reflected by the arrhythmic expression of cell cycle genes in these tumors. consistently, bmal <dig> knockdown in vitro also prevented the dex-induced rhythms in cell cycle phases .

knockdown of bmal <dig> prevents the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on tumor growth
next we sought to determine whether clock function in the b <dig> tumors is needed for dex-induced reduction in tumor growth. as expected, b <dig> tumors expressing the scrambled shrna grew more slowly during dex treatment: after  <dig> days, dex-treated tumors were ~60% smaller than pbs-treated tumors  and this is consistent with the growth of untransfected tumors . in contrast, tumor volumes were indistinguishable between dex- and pbs-treated mice harboring bmal <dig> shrna tumors . thus, dex had no effect on tumor growth after bmal <dig> knockdown. volume doubling time analysis of scrambled and bmal <dig> shrna tumors confirmed these results . similar results were obtained in vitro using bmal <dig> and scrambled shrna-transfected cells .

consistent with the data obtained using nsg mice , dex did not affect the levels of immune cell infiltration in b <dig> tumors inoculated in the syngeneic c57bl/6j mice or in bmal <dig> knockdown tumors, indicated by similar values for b cells, dendritic cells, cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes . these data confirmed that the slower tumor growth was not caused by effects of dex on immune cell infiltration. overall, these findings are in strong support of the notion that activating circadian clock function within b <dig> tumors slows down their growth.

enhancement of circadian rhythms slows down hct- <dig> tumor growth
to test the link between the circadian clock and tumor growth beyond our model using mouse melanoma, we treated human hct- <dig> colon carcinoma cells with dex and measured clock gene expression as well as proliferation and apoptosis up to  <dig> h after the treatment. hct- <dig> cells exhibited rhythmic clock gene expression upon dex treatment , which could be due to either synchronization of individual cells’ clocks or de novo activation of clocks in the cells. upon this treatment hct- <dig> cell proliferation was strongly decreased while apoptosis levels were unaffected .fig.  <dig> dexamethasone  induces circadian rhythms and reduces hct- <dig> cell proliferation and tumor growth in vivo. a, b

similar to the b <dig> s.c. tumors in c57bl/ <dig> j and nsg mice, growth of tumors formed in nsg mice after hct- <dig> cell inoculation was strongly slowed down after dex treatment . these data underscore the possibility that controlling cell division rate by circadian clock enhancement and thus controlling tumor growth is not restricted to mouse melanoma cells, and may be generally applicable to human cancer cells and to other cancer types.

discussion
in this report, we showed that b <dig> melanoma cells and b <dig> tumors have suppressed expression of clock components, which is in line with previous reports on different cancer cell lines and tumors . however, we discovered that different treatments could restore clock gene expression in b <dig> cells and tumors. this provided an experimental model in which the same tumor type could be compared in conditions of inactive or active circadian oscillator function. using this model, we showed that restoring clock function in b <dig> melanoma cells strongly reduced cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo . we also extended our observations to another cancer cell model, the human colon carcinoma hct- <dig> cells. in all of the in vivo tumor experiments, a strong slowdown of tumor growth was observed, with a two thirds reduction of tumor size after  <dig> days of treatment, regardless of the host or cancer cell line used.fig.  <dig> model for the suppressive effect of clock activation on tumor growth. untreated cancer cells harbor an inactive circadian clock and exhibit fast cell cycle progression and fast tumor growth . dexamethasone , forskolin , serum shock or heat shock activate the circadian clock in cancer cells, which regulates circadian expression of cell cycle checkpoint genes , which results in slower tumor growth . treatment of cancer cells transfected with bmal <dig> shrna does not result in an activation of the circadian clock and thus no rhythmic cell cycle gene expression, which results in fast tumor growth . see discussion for details




the amplitude of clock gene rhythmicity within tumors was previously correlated with their growth in mice bearing glasgow osteosarcoma  <cit>  and pancreatic adenocarcinoma  <cit> . furthermore, a dysregulated circadian tumor clock in human patients correlated with their prognosis  <cit> . together, these prior studies indicate that the tumor clock may have an impact on tumor growth and overall survival . however, until our present report, a causal link was missing to solidify the importance of the tumor clock itself, as opposed to host-derived circadian rhythms. previous studies showed that glucocorticoids suppress proliferation in human melanoma cells and b <dig> tumors after intraperitoneal dex injection in mice  <cit> . importantly, our data provide a cellular mechanism for these effects. in contrast to prior work, our data were generated using intra-tumor injection of dex restricted to the tumor and at low doses. furthermore, we showed an absence of effects on clock gene expression in the liver. thus, our work is the first to show a tumor-intrinsic mechanism for the control of tumor growth by the circadian clock. moreover, the effects of restored synchronous circadian rhythmicity on tumor growth also extend to a distinct tumor cell model, the human colon carcinoma hct- <dig> cells, although in the case of these cells we cannot exclude a role of dex in synchronizing the clocks in individual cells rather than an activation of the cellular clocks.

dex and fsk have previously been reported to have varying effects on apoptosis, depending on the cell line or tumor model used . nevertheless, and in line with previous reports on fibroblasts  <cit> , we found no or minor effects of dex, fsk or heat shock on apoptosis in b <dig> cells. thus, in our experiments, the activation of circadian clock function in tumors resulted in reduced growth independently of deregulated apoptosis. given the immune-modulating properties of glucocorticoids  <cit> , we also aimed to exclude an effect of dex on the immune cell content of the tumors as the cause of the observed decrease in tumor growth. notably, immune cell content was not changed by the intra-tumoral dex treatment. moreover, the effect of dex on tumor growth was recapitulated in nsg mice, which lack t cells, b cells and natural killer cells, further strengthening our claim. in order to directly test the hypothesis that dex inhibits tumor growth via the tumor-intrinsic circadian clock, we used shrna against the essential clock gene bmal <dig>  the response to dex was abrogated in b <dig> tumors with a bmal <dig> knockdown. thus, the suppressive dex effect on b <dig> proliferation and tumor growth requires a functional clock within b <dig> cells. it is unlikely that bmal <dig> knockdown affects the response to dex itself, because bmal <dig> dysfunction did not interfere with glucocorticoid receptor expression as observed in transcriptome datasets . of note, we observed a similar induction of circadian rhythms and inhibition of b <dig> cell proliferation in vitro following other treatments besides dex, as well as with a non-pharmacological treatment, heat shock. serum, dex, fsk and heat shock all reset cellular clocks by inducing clock genes such as per genes  <cit> , but different signaling pathways are involved: dex activates per <dig> via the glucocorticoid receptor  <cit> , but dex can also synchronize the circadian clock via glucocorticoid receptor-independent pathways, as was shown for hct- <dig> cells  <cit> ; fsk activates the camp/protein kinase a pathway, and thus, camp response element-binding protein activity at the per <dig> promoter  <cit> ; and heat shock activates per <dig> transcription via heat shock factor  <dig>  <cit> . given that these treatments similarly activate the clock by mechanisms distinct from dex, this further suggests a clock-dependent action of dex.

taken together our results indicate that reduced tumor growth after dex treatment was not caused by enhanced apoptosis, nor immune infiltration in the tumor, but rather relies specifically on inducing circadian rhythms within the tumor. for the first time, our work unveils a causal relationship between the tumor-intrinsic circadian clock and tumor growth .

our findings raise the question of how the activation of circadian clock function in b <dig> cells leads to inhibition of tumor growth. the circadian clock has been shown to regulate cell cycle genes and, thus, progression through the cell cycle  <cit> . indeed, we identified rhythmic cell cycle genes after induction of clock function in b <dig> cells and tumors. in particular, cyclin e, p <dig> and c-myc exhibited circadian oscillations at the mrna and protein levels. clock-bmal <dig> represses c-myc, an activator of cyclin e  <cit> , and another clock component, nr1d <dig>  inhibits the synthesis of the cdk inhibitor p <dig>  <cit> . thus, restored expression of the major clock components in b <dig> tumors likely accounts for the observed changes in cell cycle gene expression.

our data indicate that the circadian gating distributes more b <dig> cells in the g <dig> phase  and fewer in the s phase, which prolongs the transit through the cell cycle and may account for the observed lengthening of the pdt. thus, fewer cells initiated dna replication, which could underlie the observed reduced tumor growth. in line with our observations, accumulation in cell cycle phases such as g <dig> or g <dig> was reported to slow down proliferation in human melanoma cells  <cit> . g1-to-s transit is regulated by cell cycle checkpoint regulators, in particular the cyclin e/cdk <dig> complex  <cit> . importantly we have identified rhythmic expression of the inhibitor p <dig>  c-myc and a component of this checkpoint complex itself, cyclin e. consequently, rhythmic regulation of the cyclin e/cdk <dig> complex may result in a prolonged stay in the g <dig> phase. taken together, rhythmic changes in expression levels of cyclin e, p <dig> and c-myc after activation of the clock by dex likely caused the observed redistribution of b <dig> cells among cell cycle phases . moreover, our results highlight a possible strategy of b <dig> melanoma cells to facilitate their proliferation: suppression of the circadian clock induces changes in their cell cycle, which leads to increased residence time in the s phase and an enhancement of dna replication and thus cell proliferation.

CONCLUSIONS
glucocorticoids have been used to treat various cancer types for decades, in many cases as an adjuvant to other chemotherapies  <cit> . while potential mechanisms have been described in different cell types, exactly how glucocorticoids regulate apoptosis or cell cycle progression is not fully understood  <cit> . our work indicates a possible mechanism  for how glucocorticoids can inhibit cancer cell proliferation, namely by inducing circadian rhythms in cancer cell cycle events to limit the number of cells in the s phase and thereby increase the time spent in the g <dig> phase. therefore, our work opens new windows of opportunity in cancer therapy based on chronobiological intervention. for example, activation of the clock in tumors may represent a new therapeutic target for malignant melanoma therapy in humans. because our observations extended to human colon cancer cells, this strategy might more generally become an innovative way to slow down cancer progression and thereby improve the outcome of established anti-cancer therapies. slowing down tumor progression by improving circadian rhythmicity might critically delay cancer progression and/or metastasis. this could in turn increase treatment success with traditional chemotherapy or provide a broader time window for surgical resection of tumors.
