BACKGROUND
yeast cells have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to withstand a variety of stresses including limited availability of nutrients, fluctuations in temperature, changes in osmolarity, and the presence of harmful agents such as radiation or toxic chemicals. a myriad of strategies have evolved to maintain cellular homeostasis under stressful conditions including the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathways. thus far,  <dig> mapk pathways have been characterized in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . the fundamental function of these mapk pathways is to regulate gene expression in response to various extracellular signals.

the high osmolarity glycerol  pathway is one of the most thoroughly studied mapk pathways in yeast. the hog pathway involves the mapk hog <dig> that specifically responds to increased extracellular osmolarity and is essential for cell survival under these conditions. yeast cells respond to osmotic stress by activating hog <dig> phosphorylation and, subsequently, translocating hog <dig> to the nucleus where it directly interacts with several transcription factors to modulate gene expression. recently, several studies have demonstrated additional functions of the hog mapk pathway. evidence shows that the hog pathway is essential for regulating the stress adaptation response induced by heat  <cit> , citric acid  <cit> , or low temperature  <cit> . the hog pathway is also involved in providing tolerance to methylglyoxal  <cit>  and the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide   <cit> , and reportedly plays a role in cell wall maintenance  <cit>  and the distribution of proteins within the golgi  <cit> .

curcumin  is the principal bioactive agent in the spice turmeric  <cit> . turmeric contains a class of compounds known as the curcuminoids, which includes curcumin, desmethoxycurcumin and bisdesmethoxycurcumin  <cit> . cur has been consumed as a dietary supplement for centuries and has been widely used in ayurvedic medicines  <cit> . because of the promising therapeutic potential of cur, several clinical trials have been initiated or conducted to explore the effect of dietary cur in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases, several forms of cancer including colon and pancreatic cancer, bowel diseases, and other diseases  <cit> . although extensive research has been performed on this drug, new biological targets of cur are still being identified. in previous work, we demonstrated that the medicinal properties of cur are largely the result of its cumulative effect on iron starvation and epigenetic modifications  <cit> . thus, the present study was designed to test whether the hog <dig> mapk is also activated in yeast cells exposed to the natural compound cur or not.

we demonstrate that cur exposure in yeast cells leads to phosphorylation of hog <dig> and up-regulation of gpd <dig> mrna levels. the findings presented here strongly indicate that the ability of cur to induce the osmoresponse may underlie many of the therapeutic activities of cur.

RESULTS
cur induced growth arrest in yeast cells was rescued by iron supplementation
to test the dose dependent effect of cur on yeast cell cycle progression, we performed facs analysis. exponentially growing yeast cells were synchronized in the g <dig> phase using alpha-factor. after synchronization, g <dig> arrested cells were released into dmso  or cur  supplemented media. the results from the facs analysis revealed that the dmso-treated cells quickly moved to the g <dig> phase within  <dig> minutes of release from the alpha-factor arrest , whereas  <dig> μm cur treatment led to a delay in the cell cycle progression . in the case of  <dig> μm cur treatment, cells remained in the g <dig> phase throughout the duration of the experiment . even after  <dig> minutes, cells released into media containing  <dig> μm cur were not able to progress to the g <dig> phase , suggesting that cur causes prolonged g <dig> phase leading to delay in cell cycle progression. previously, we have shown that iron supplementation rescues the growth inhibitory effect of cur on yeast cells  <cit> , hence we also analyzed the cell cycle progression in presence of curcumin after supplementation with iron. the results revealed that yeast cells recover from the cell cycle arrest in presence of iron . however, the dose of iron used in this experiment  doesn’t affect cell cycle progression . altogether, these results indicate that cur induced growth arrest in yeast cells can be rescued by iron supplementation.figure  <dig> 
cur treatment induces growth arrest in yeast cells can be rescued upon iron supplementation. wild type cells  were cultured in synthetic complete  medium until they reached the exponential phase. yeast cells were then treated with alpha-factor to synchronize them in the g <dig> phase. after synchronization, cells were released into media supplemented with  dmso ,   <dig> μm cur,   <dig> μm cur and   <dig> μm cur supplemented with  <dig> μm iron. the cultures were sampled at the indicated time points and their dna content was then analyzed by facs.



hog <dig> is phosphorylated in response to curcumin treatment
previously, we have identified several histone acetyltransferases  and histone deacetylases  that are required to provide tolerance to cur-induced stress  <cit> . one such hdac, rpd3p, is known to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of osmoresponse genes under conditions of osmotic stress  <cit> . because rpd <dig> deletion mutant was hypersensitive to cur  <cit> , we hypothesized that cur might be inducing osmotic stress. to test this possibility, we analyzed the phosphorylation of hog <dig>  the central kinase involved in the regulation of osmoresponse in yeast. the phosphorylation of hog <dig> is a hallmark for the activation of the osmotic stress response in yeast. to determine whether the exposure of yeast cells to cur results in the activation of hog <dig> protein, we analyzed the activation of hog <dig> by performing a western blot with an antibody specific for the dually phosphorylated form of hog <dig> . upon incubation with increasing concentrations of cur  for  <dig> h, we were able to detect the phosphorylated form of hog <dig> at a dose of  <dig> or  <dig> μm cur through western blot . to determine that the observed increase in phosphorylated hog <dig> levels is the result of phosphorylation and not the result of an increase in hog <dig>  we examined the total levels of hog <dig>  in these experiments, we used yeast cells that express gfp-tagged hog <dig> . as illustrated in the western blot using an anti-gfp antibody, we found no increase in the band density in response to cur exposure . to further substantiate these results, we measured hog <dig> mrna levels upon exposure to cur. as shown in figure 2b, we failed to observe a significant increase in hog <dig> expression in response to cur treatment.figure  <dig> 
hog <dig> protein is phosphorylated in response to curcumin treatment.  a yeast strain expressing gfp-tagged hog <dig>  was grown until the exponential phase. protein was extracted from cells incubated for  <dig> h with increasing concentrations of cur . the phosphorylated form of hog <dig> was detected using an anti-phospho-p <dig> antibody . the western blot membranes were probed for total hog <dig> using a polyclonal anti-gfp antibody and this served as a loading control.  an exponentially growing wild type yeast strain was exposed to  <dig> μm cur for  <dig> h. samples were taken after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> min of incubation. the expression of hog <dig> mrna levels was examined by sybr green real-time pcr. the error bars represent the standard deviation  of three independent replicates.  protein was extracted from cells incubated with either  <dig>  m nacl or  <dig> μm cur at the indicated time points. the western blot membranes were probed for phospho-hog <dig> or total hog <dig> . the anti-gfp signal served as a loading control.



next, we were interested to analyze the time point kinetics of cur-induced hog <dig> phosphorylation. as a positive control,  <dig> m nacl treated samples were analyzed for hog <dig> phosphorylation and as per reports  <cit>  phosphorylation of hog <dig> started very early and remained detectable for  <dig> min, after which it started to decrease . while in case of cur treatment, it was possible to detect phosphorylated hog <dig> within  <dig> minutes of incubation. interestingly, unlike nacl, the cur-induced phosphorylated hog <dig> remained phosphorylated for an extended duration  as revealed by western blotting . taken together, these data clearly suggest that cur exposure induces hog <dig> phosphorylation.

iron supplementation rescues curcumin-induced hog <dig> phosphorylation
since, we have observed that iron supplementation can rescue the growth inhibition caused by cur treatment . therefore, we examined whether the supplementation of iron can rescue the cur-induced hog <dig> phosphorylation. first, we analyzed the effect of iron  and bps  on hog <dig> phosphorylation. as shown in figure 3a and b, iron or bps doesn’t causes phosphorylation of hog <dig>  as no signal appeared in western blotting with phospho-hog <dig> antibody. next, we treated yeast cells with  <dig> μm cur to observe the hog <dig> phosphorylation till  <dig> h. we quantified the hog <dig> phosphorylation levels using image j software and results revealed that phosphorylation remains almost constant till  <dig> h . next, we treated exponentially growing yeast cells with  <dig> μm cur for  <dig> min followed by supplementation of iron  in the media. cells were harvested till 4h post-treatment with iron. our western blotting revealed that the levels of phosphorylated hog <dig> was reduced significantly after addition of iron . these results clearly suggest that cur-induced iron starvation leads to hog <dig> phosphorylation and that can be rescued upon iron supplementation.figure  <dig> 
analysis of hog <dig> phosphorylation after addition of iron.  a yeast strain expressing gfp-tagged hog <dig>  was grown until the exponential phase. protein was extracted from cells incubated for  <dig> h with increasing concentrations of iron . the phosphorylated form of hog <dig> was detected using an anti-phospho-p <dig> antibody . the western blot membranes were probed for total hog <dig> using a polyclonal anti-gfp antibody and this served as a loading control  cells were treated with bps for  <dig> min followed by addition of iron  and cells were harvested at indicated time points. proteins were extracted and phosphorylation of hog <dig> was detected by phospho-hog <dig> antibody. the western blot membranes were probed for total hog <dig> using a polyclonal anti-gfp antibody and this served as a loading control  protein was extracted from cells incubated with  <dig> μm cur at the indicated time points. the western blot membranes were probed for phospho-hog <dig> and anti-gfp . the intensity of phosphorylated hog <dig> was quantified using image j software and normalized with respect to total hog1p levels  and shown in the form of bar diagramme. the error bars represent the standard deviation  of three independent replicates.  yeast strain expressing gfp-tagged hog <dig>  was treated with  <dig> μm cur for  <dig> min followed by addition of iron . cells were harvested at indicated time points in figure and protein were extracted. the phosphorylation of hog <dig> was detected by phospho-hog <dig> antibody. the western blot membranes were probed for total hog <dig> using a polyclonal anti-gfp antibody and this served as a loading control. the intensity of phosphorylated hog <dig> was quantified using image j software and normalized with respect to total hog1p levels  and shown in the form of bar diagramme. the error bars represent the standard deviation  of three independent replicates. 
hog1Δ cells were treated with alpha-factor to synchronize them in the g <dig> phase. after synchronization, cells were released into media supplemented with  dmso ,   <dig> μm cur,   <dig> μm cur supplemented with  <dig> μm iron and   <dig> μm iron. the cultures were sampled at the indicated time points and their dna content was then analyzed by facs.



since, we have observed the phosphorylation of hog <dig> in response to cur exposure; next we were motivated to observe the effect of cur on hog <dig> deletion mutant. we arrested hog1Δ cells with alpha-factor to arrest them in g <dig> phase as described in materials and methods. g <dig> arrested hog1Δ cells were released in fresh media containing dmso or media supplemented with  <dig> μm cur. the results from the facs analysis revealed that the dmso-treated cells quickly moved to the g <dig> phase within  <dig> minutes of release from the alpha-factor arrest , whereas  <dig> μm cur treatment led to a delay in cell cycle progression . while, the cell cycle progression was resumed in presence of curcumin after supplementation with iron . the results revealed that hog1Δ yeast mutant can also recover cell cycle arrest in presence of iron. the dose of iron used in this experiment  doesn’t affect cell cycle progression . altogether, these results indicate that cur induced growth arrest in yeast cells can be rescued by iron supplementation.

ssk <dig>  msb <dig>  and ptc <dig> deletions abrogate curcumin-induced hog <dig> phosphorylation
as a member of mapk family, hog <dig> is phosphorylated by several upstream kinases that are involved in mediating osmostress response. we evaluated the phosphorylation of hog <dig> protein in several hog pathway mutants to investigate the role of these factors in mediating cur-induced hog <dig> phosphorylation. wild type and mutant yeast strains were grown until they reached the exponential phase before being treated with  <dig> μm cur for  <dig> h. whole cell extracts were prepared as detailed in the materials and methods and a western blot was performed to analyze the phosphorylation of hog <dig>  as a control, cells were treated with the same concentration of dmso. the western blot revealed that the phosphorylation of hog <dig> was reduced in the ssk2Δ, msb2Δ, ptc2Δ and pbs2Δ deletion mutants relative to that in wild type cells . these results suggest that ssk2p, msb2p, ptc2p, and pbs2p are important components of the hog pathway and are required for the optimal activation of hog <dig> in response to cur-induced stress.figure  <dig>

cur-induced phosphorylated hog <dig> gets translocated to the nucleus leading to over-expression of gpd <dig> mrna levels
in response to osmotic stress, hog <dig> is phosphorylated and translocated into nucleus where it regulates the expression of several osmoresponsive genes  <cit> . hence, we were interested to determine the localization of cur-induced phosphorylated hog <dig>  we treated exponentially growing yeast cells with  <dig> μm cur for  <dig> h. we fractionated whole cell extract of yeast into nuclear and cytosolic fractions following a protocol as described in materials and methods. our western blotting with phospho-hog <dig> antibody revealed that phosphorylated hog <dig> protein is localized into the nuclear fraction . this result suggests that cur-induced phosphorylated hog <dig> is translocated to nucleus. it is well established that hog <dig> is phosphorylated and translocated to nucleus in response to osmotic stress. once it is in the nucleus, hog <dig> regulates the expression of various osmoresponse genes  <cit> . this prompted us to analyze the expression of one such gene, gpd <dig> that encodes a factor involved in glycerol biosynthesis during osmotic stress  <cit> . wild type or hog1Δ yeast cells were treated with cur  and harvested at regular intervals  after treatment. total rna was extracted, reverse-transcribed to cdna, and the expression of gpd <dig> was analyzed using real-time pcr. transcript levels were normalized to the reference gene alg <dig>  in case of wild type cells we observed a consistent 2– <dig> fold increase in the expression of gpd <dig> within  <dig> min of cur exposure . this increase was maintained for  <dig> h . this strongly indicates that upon cur exposure, hog <dig> is not only phosphorylated, but also causes an up-regulation of gpd <dig> mrna levels. to ensure that the up-regulation of gpd <dig> upon cur treatment is due to hog <dig>  we analysed the expression of gpd <dig> mrna in hog1Δ cells. our quantitative pcr revealed that hog1Δ cells failed to up-regulate gpd <dig> mrna upon cur treatment  suggesting the specific requirement of hog <dig>  altogether, these results suggest that the cur-induced transcription response requires hog <dig> and mediated through hog <dig> phosphorylation in yeast cells.figure  <dig>

 nuclear-cytoplasmic extracts were made as described in materials and methods. whole cell extract , cytoplasmic fraction  and nuclear fraction  were loaded on sds-page and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. western blot with anti-h3k36me <dig> antibody was performed to ensure the integrity of extract fractionation . the distribution of phosphorylated hog <dig> was analyzed by probing with phospho-hog <dig> antibody.  an exponentially growing wild type or hog1Δ yeast strain was exposed to  <dig> μm cur for  <dig> h. samples were taken after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> min of incubation. the expression of gpd <dig> mrna levels in wild type or hog1Δ cells was examined by sybr green real-time pcr. the fold-change in gpd <dig> mrna levels was normalized to the reference gene alg <dig>  the error bars represent the standard deviation  of three independent replicates.



discussion
the diverse pharmacological activities of cur have been attributed to its actions on multiple cellular targets, either by interacting physically with the targets themselves or by modulating transcription factors, enzyme activity, or gene expression. in this study, we examined the requirement for a functional hog pathway to cope with cur-induced stress. if signaling through hog <dig> is essential for its function under cur-induced stress, hog <dig> should be activated by phosphorylation of residues thr <dig> and tyr <dig>  which is required for hog <dig> activation. using commercial antibodies raised against phosphorylated human p <dig>  we were able to detect the phosphorylation of hog <dig> protein after exposure of cur .

yeast hog <dig> is a stress-activated kinase that is thought to be activated exclusively by osmotic stress. however, recent studies have implicated the role of this mapk in mediating tolerance to a variety of stress conditions including osmotic  <cit> , oxidative  <cit> , heat  <cit> , arsenic  <cit> , and citric acid stress  <cit> . we have observed the phosphorylation of hog <dig> in the presence of cur  and provided evidence for the activation of the hog pathway in yeast. hog <dig> activation has been most extensively characterized under conditions of hyperosmotic shock. the exposure of s. cerevisiae to high-osmolarity leads to a rapid  and sustained  phosphorylation of hog <dig> protein  <cit> . to determine whether cur induces a slow or a rapid response, phosphorylation of hog <dig> was measured at intervals following the addition of  <dig> μm cur. addition of cur induced a rapid increase in hog <dig> phosphorylation, but unlike nacl-induced hog <dig> phosphorylation, it sustained for an extended period of time . it has been well documented that curcumin antagonizes yeast growth by chelating iron  <cit> . previously, we have demonstrated that supplementation of iron rescued the cells from the growth arrest phenotype  <cit> . moreover, we also found a novel way to reset epigenetic marks back to their normal levels by iron supplementation in the presence of curcumin  <cit> . hence, we were curious to understand whether cur-induced phosphorylation of hog <dig> can be restored after iron supplementation. interestingly, the level of phosphorylated hog <dig> was reduced significantly in presence of iron  suggesting that the activation of mapk hog <dig> by cur is also dependent on its iron chelating property.

hog <dig> is activated through a series of phosphorylation events involving the mapk kinase pbs <dig> and several other upstream factors  <cit> . to test the role of upstream components of the hog pathway in the cellular response to cur, we monitored the phosphorylation of hog <dig> in yeast strains carrying mutations in components of the hog pathway. as shown in figure 4a and b, the pbs2Δ mutant was defective in hog <dig> phosphorylation because it is the only immediate upstream kinase for hog <dig>  to test the role of upstream members of the hog pathway in the cellular response to cur, we monitored the phosphorylation of hog <dig> in yeast strains carrying mutations in the components of the hog pathway. interestingly, we also observed hog <dig> phosphorylation defects in ssk <dig>  msb <dig>  and ptc <dig> deletion mutants, suggesting the requirement of these factors for optimal hog <dig> phosphorylation in response to cur treatment. the comprehensive cur-induced growth inhibition analysis in the mutants incapable of phosphorylating hog <dig> warrants future study, where methods outlined by the clinical laboratory standards institute  m38-a  <cit>  or the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing   <cit>  can be used.

one of the main functions of the mapk pathway is the regulation of transcriptional events in response to specific stimuli. because of its phosphorylation, hog <dig> gets translocated to the nucleus  <cit> , where it targets various transcription factors, leading to upregulation of gpd <dig> mrna levels  <cit> . our results also revealed that cur-induced phosphorylated hog <dig> migrates to nucleus . we have also demonstrated that cur exposure causes up-regulation of gpd <dig> , which is required for the synthesis of a major osmolyte, glycerol. elevated glycerol production is a prerequisite for the adaptation of s. cerevisiae to hyperosmotic stress  <cit> . interestingly, the expression of gpd <dig> in response to cur treatment requires functional hog <dig> protein . notably, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time, we report that the cur exposure leads to hog <dig> phosphorylation in s. cerevisiae and this is followed by the activation of gpd <dig> gene expression. the cur has several molecular targets, other than hog <dig>  for example, cur is known to target various cell signaling pathways such as jak/stat, wnt/β-catanin, notch, pi3k/pkb, ampk, dna damage checkpoint pathway  <cit>  and many others. here, we have identified hog <dig> as an additional target of cur. considering hog <dig> is central kinase in osmotic stress pathway, the activation of hog <dig> upon cur treatment indicates that cur induces osmotic stress.

CONCLUSIONS
recently, the identification of bioactive dietary components has received particular interest in the field of pharmacology. curcumin has gained immense attention for its varied therapeutic and prophylactic applications. our results reveal new aspects of the response of s. cerevisiae to cur-induced stress . we have identified additional functions of the hog <dig> mapk in providing transcriptional activity upon exposure to cur. we believe that the findings presented in this work will enhance the understanding on the mode of curcumin action.figure  <dig>
