BACKGROUND
the signal transducers and activators of transcription  were initially identified as a family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that are activated by various cytokines, growth factors and other stimuli, and phosphorylated by many protein kinases  <cit> . in response to various stimuli, stat family members are phosphorylated by receptor associated kinases, form homo- or heterodimers and are translocated to the cell nucleus where they activate transcription  <cit> . recent studies also support the role of unphosphorylated stat <dig> that accumulates in nucleus and activates transcription by binding to nfkappab  <cit> . stat <dig> regulates a variety of biological processes, functioning at both transcriptional and non-transcriptional levels to influence cell growth, survival and metabolism. its capacity to induce cell transformation and tumorigenesis makes it a potential therapeutic target for various cancers  <cit> .

systemic deletion of stat <dig> is embryonic lethal in the mouse, indicating its important role in embryogenesis  <cit> . biological roles of stat <dig> in various organs and cells have been studied in vitro as well as cell specific deletion in the mouse in vivo. the biological consequences of stat <dig> deletion are surprisingly diverse and sometimes contradictory. for example, cardiomyocyte-specific stat <dig> deficiency caused cardiac fibrosis and heart dysfunction with advanced age  <cit> . hepatic cell specific deletion of stat <dig> caused insulin resistance associated with increased expression of gluconeogenic genes  <cit> . conditional ablation of stat <dig> in respiratory epithelium of the mouse  did not alter lung morphogenesis or function but enhanced susceptibility to hyperoxia and adenoviral induced lung injury whereas overexpression of stat3c  in pulmonary epithelium protects against hyperoxic lung injury, suggesting that stat <dig> is required for the maintenance of surfactant homeostasis and lung function during injury  <cit> . while stat <dig> has been proposed as an anti-apoptotic protein through the induction of survival genes such as bcl2-like  <dig> and b-cell leukemia/lymphoma  <dig> , stat <dig> also exerts pro-apoptotic effect through the regulation of insulin-like growth factor binding protein  <dig>  to modulate mammary epithelial apoptosis  <cit> . stat <dig> is abundantly and ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and distributed between the cell cytosol and nucleus. a direct effect of non-phosphorylated, cytoplasmic stat <dig> on cell motility was reported recently through direct protein-protein interactions  <cit> , indicating a non-transcriptional function of stat <dig> 

the functions of stat <dig> vary in different cellular and physiologic contexts, influencing diverse gene targets by interaction with other proteins and genes. the diversity of stat <dig> functions indicate that stat <dig> is involved in complex genetic networks to maintain cellular homeostasis rather serving a singular role in acute phase responses as initially defined. in the present study, we sought to systemically study the role of stat <dig> in pulmonary epithelial cell homeostasis. using knowledge based gene expression profiling approaches and a conditional system that selectively deleted stat <dig> in the respiratory epithelium; we identified a large stat3-dependent network that influences a wide variety of biological processes in type ii alveolar cells in the lung.

RESULTS
identification of differentially expressed genes in alveolar type ii epithelial cells from stat3Δ/Δ mice
in previous studies stat <dig> mrna and protein expression were markedly reduced in type ii cells isolated from stat3Δ/Δ mice, being less than 10% of control levels  <cit> . to identify the rnas influenced by the conditional deletion of stat3Δ/Δ, rnas isolated from alveolar epithelial type ii cells of control and stat3Δ/Δ mice were compared using affymetrix murine genome moe <dig> gene chips. the complete dataset can be found at gene expression omnibus   <cit> ; accession no. gse <dig>  total of  <dig> genes were identified as significantly altered using the criteria described in method. among them,  <dig> mrnas were increased and  <dig> mrnas were decreased in response to the deletion of stat3Δ/Δ in the lung . changes in mrna expression of a subset of genes including malt <dig>  rnt <dig>  reg3g, bcl2l <dig>  cds <dig>  cdipt, fasn, acox <dig>  akt <dig>  gpam, foxj <dig>  abca <dig>  srebf <dig>  srebf <dig> and scap were validated by real-time rt-pcr. genes cross validated by rt-pcr are listed in table  <dig> and indicated by asterisks  in additional file  <dig> 

note: fold change of mrna in stat3Δ/Δ mice to control is shown.

functional classification of differentially expressed genes revealed the dysregulation of various biological processes in type ii epithelial cells from stat3Δ/Δ mice
differentially expressed genes were classified according to gene ontology  classification on biological process. the fisher exact test was used to calculate the probability of each category that was overrepresented in the selected list using the entire moe <dig> mouse genome as reference dataset. deletion of stat <dig> from type ii cells significantly induced the genes involved in protein metabolism, protein transport, chemotaxis and apoptosis and decreased the expression of genes in lipid synthesis and metabolism .

note: gene ontology analysis was preformed using public available web-based tool david  <cit> . overrepresented biological processes were selected at the threshold of fisher exact test p-value ≤  <dig>  and minimum gene counts belonging to an annotation term ≥ 2%.

promoter analysis identified putative common regulators of the differentially expressed genes
to identify putative common transcription factors regulating the type ii cell responses to stat <dig> deletion, promoter region  of differentially expressed genes were searched for overrepresented cis-elements using matinspector  vertebrate matrix library. in compare with the sequence of random chosen gene promoters, the cis-elements significantly enriched in the promoter region of differentially expressed genes were selected based on a binomial probability calculation and their percentage frequency in our selected gene list . stat, egrf, ahrr, sp1f, zf5f, e2ff, hiff, sreb and ap2f were the most overrepresented cis-elements and may therefore mediate changes in gene expression in cells from stat3Δ/Δ mice . the finding that stat was the most enriched cis-elements indicated the identification of a sub-group of potential direct transcriptional targets of stat <dig> in lung epithelial cells. sterol regulatory element binding factors , were significantly decreased in stat3Δ/Δ mice. the sreb binding site was overrepresented in differentially expressed genes indicating that it is a potential regulator of the lipid metabolism pathways altered in stat3Δ/Δ mice. other significantly enriched tfbs include sp1f and hiff. stat <dig> and sp <dig> function cooperatively to activate the c/ebp promoter, the sp <dig> site being required for il- <dig> induction and transactivation by stat <dig>  <cit> . hif1a, sp <dig>  smad <dig> and smad <dig> can form multifactor complex, regulating vegf and erythropoietin gene transcription through functional cooperation and association  <cit> . consistent with the promoter analyses and literature findings, the mrna expression of klf <dig>  and hif1a, smad <dig> and smad <dig> was simultaneously increased by stat <dig> deletion, indicating the potential transcriptional complex formation among the corresponding transcription factors.

note: promoter sequence  from  <dig> out of  <dig> differentially genes were available for analysis. the p-value is calculated using binomial distribution probability.  <dig> random sets of  <dig> mouse gene -2kb promoter regions were used to calculate the background frequency. the q-value is calculated using single-step bonferroni adjustment to control for the multiple comparison effect.

pathway analysis revealed known and novel functions of stat <dig> in the lung
pathway enrichment test is an unbiased way to answer the question, ''are the differentially expressed genes enriched in certain pathways?'' to address this issue, we compared the overlap of differentially expressed genes in stat3Δ/Δ mice with the known biological pathways in kegg  using 1) the mouse genome and 2) a list of genes shown to be least changed in response to the stat <dig> deletion in the gene array as background. results from both analyses were consistent. jak-stat signaling pathway, apoptosis, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, insulin signaling pathway, mapk signaling pathway, focal adhesion, and wnt signaling pathway were among the most enriched pathways identified from the analysis of differentially expressed genes . mrnas mediating steroid biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism were mostly decreased in stat3Δ/Δ mice. the most overrepresented pathways and the differentially expressed genes associated with those pathways are illustrated in additional files  <dig>  the finding that known stat <dig> functions, including the jak-stat signaling pathway were identified from microarray analysis of stat3Δ/Δ mice type ii cells using knowledge integration approaches provides support for the utility of the analysis to detect novel pathways regulated by stat <dig> 

overrepresented pathways were identified by comparison the overlap of differentially expressed genes and all genes in moe <dig> mouse genome  with the known kegg pathways. a pathway is considered to be over-represented when a probability p-value ≤  <dig>  and gene frequency  ≥ 2%.

stat <dig> influences protein metabolism in lung type ii cells
''protein metabolism'' was the most enriched biological process , accounting for 20% of the induced genes caused by the deletion of stat <dig>  more than  <dig> genes encoding proteins involved in protein ubiquitination/ubiquitin cycle were present . of interest, casitas b-lineage lymphoma b  was increased  <dig>  fold. cblb is a member of cbl ubiquitin ligases  protein family that are tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to a wide variety of receptor mediated stimuli, including epidermal growth factor receptors, cytokine receptors such as colony stimulating factor family receptors  and immune complex receptors such as fcgr2b . cblb functions as an adaptor protein that regulates many signal-transduction pathways including jak-stat signaling pathways through its ability to interact with critical signaling molecules  <cit> . the expression of genes encoding known cblb binding partners was significantly increased in type ii cells from the stat3Δ/Δ mice, including syk kinase , jak <dig> , pkc , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , adenylate cyclase-associated protein  <dig>  and crk . these signaling molecules can in turn modulate various down stream signaling cascades including those mediated by small g-proteins , as well as pi3k/akt mediated signaling and nfat induction   <cit> . cblb physically interacts with another ubiquitin-protein ligase, nedd <dig> , an interaction that reverses cblb effects by targeting cblb for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation  <cit> . slim is a known e <dig> ubiquitin ligase specifically interacts with activated stat <dig> and stat <dig>  inducing their ubiquitination and degradation  <cit> . we speculate that cblb may act in a similar manner to regulate stat <dig> signaling. in addition, sumo <dig> and sumo <dig> specific peptidase  <dig> were both increased more than  <dig> fold in stat3Δ/Δ mice. sumo <dig> can covalently modify many targets including stat <dig> and glucocorticoid receptor nr3c <dig>  and regulate protein stability and transcriptional activity  <cit> . taken together, deletion of stat <dig> activates a number of molecules regulating protein metabolism, stability and routing, indicating the potential role of ubiquitination and sumoylation in cytokine signaling and stat <dig> activation that influences cellular adaptation.

stat <dig> influences phosphate metabolism and protein kinase cascade in lung type ii cells
expression of genes regulating ''phosphate metabolism'' and ''protein kinase cascade'' were significantly increased in stat3Δ/Δ mice , accounting for  <dig> % of total induced genes . expression of genes encoding a number of kinase that phosphorylate stat <dig> in vivo or in vitro were increased  <cit> , including janus kinase  <dig> and  <dig> , ribosomal protein s <dig> kinase polypeptide  <dig> , met proto-oncogene , mitogen activated protein kinase  <dig>  and dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1a . the increased expression of these genes indicates a potential compensatory mechanism related to the lack of activation of stat <dig> or its targets.

stat <dig> influences lipid homeostasis in lung type ii cells
expression of genes encoding sterol regulatory element binding factor  <dig> and  <dig> , their cleavage activating protein  and multiple srebp target genes involved in lipid metabolism were decreased in stat3Δ/Δ mice type ii cells. as depicted in figure  <dig>  genes dedicated to the biosynthesis of fatty acid, phospholipid and cholesterol were down regulated, with the exception of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a synthase , which was increased. hmgcs participates in other metabolic pathways, including valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation . this analysis indicates that metabolic pathways regulating fatty acid, phospholipid, and cholesterol biosynthesis were coordinately decreased after deletion of stat <dig> in type ii cells, supporting an important role of stat <dig> in regulating lipids biosynthesis in the lung. ldl receptor , mediating cholesterol uptake, and atp-binding cassette a <dig> , important for phospholipid transport, lamellar body formation and pulmonary surfactant secretion in alveolar type ii cells were decreased in the stat3Δ/Δ mice cells  <cit> . recent in vitro studies from our group confirmed the direct binding of srebp1c to the abca <dig> promoter . on the other hand, the increased expression of abca <dig>  a key facilitator of cellular cholesterol and phospholipid export  <cit>  and high density lipoprotein binding protein , which may function in the removal of excess cellular cholesterol, suggests that cholesterol and phospholipid clearance were induced after deletion of stat <dig>  adenosine kinase , was increased  <dig>  fold. cellular role of adk in lipid metabolism is somewhat controversial  <cit> , adk deficient mice developed neonatal hepatic steatosis and die within  <dig> days with fatty liver  <cit> . increased expression of lipid export genes and decreased expression of genes mediating lipid biosynthesis likely cause a reduction of total lipids level in the type ii cells of stat3Δ/Δ mice.

previous studies demonstrated the susceptibility of stat3Δ/Δ mice to lung injury and death related to surfactant dysfunction  <cit> . consistent with our prediction from the present mrna microarray analysis, the saturated phosphatidycholine  content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was significantly decreased in stat3Δ/Δ mice . significantly decreased satpc synthesis and abnormalities in lamellar body numbers and morphology were also observed in stat3Δ/Δ mice . taken together, a number of genes regulating surfactant lipid homeostasis were altered in type ii cells isolated from the stat3Δ/Δ mice, consistent with biochemical, functional, and morphologic changes in the surfactant system that is exacerbated by oxidant stress  <cit>  or expose to pathogens  <cit> .

role of akt in stat <dig> regulated lipid metabolism
our observations support the view that the decrease in srebp, at least in part, results in decreased expression of genes regulating lipid biosynthesis and metabolism in type ii cells from stat3Δ/Δ mice. srebps are master regulators of lipid metabolism. the transcriptional targets, and the pathways mediated by srebp in liver have been well studied  <cit> . srebps are expressed in the developing lung, sreb1c increases in the developing lung concomitantly with the perinatal increase in surfactant and lipid synthesis, surfactant protein and abca <dig> expression, genes critical for surfactant function.

however, the role of stat <dig> in regulating srebp and associated lipid metabolism in the lung is largely unknown. in the present analysis, we sought to identify mechanisms by which stat <dig> regulates srebps and associated lipid biosynthesis pathways in alveolar type ii cells in the lung. the regulation of srebps occurs at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. the post-transcriptional regulation requires scap. cre-mediated disruption of scap significantly reduced srebf <dig> and  <dig> levels as well as srebp target gene expression in liver  <cit> . there are multiple potential stat sites on the scap promoter. thus, stat <dig> may influence lipid biosynthesis through the transcriptional regulation of scap. at transcriptional level, nuclear hormone receptors  and pgc1-alpha and beta are known to regulate srebps expression in liver. increased expression of srebf <dig> and fasn was associated with increased hepatic triglyceride content in stat <dig> deficient mice  <cit> . in the present study, expression of srebp and their down stream targets were decreased in type ii cells from stat3Δ/Δ mice  without changes in other known regulators such as nr1h <dig>  nr1h <dig>  pgc1-alpha or pgc1-beta, indicating the likely presence of alternative regulatory mechanisms in lung cells.

we hypothesize that akt plays an important role in stat <dig> regulated srebp expression and associated lipogenesis in lung based on the following observations: 1) protein and mrna levels of akt were increased in cells constitutively expressing active stat <dig> and were reduced after stat <dig> depletion  <cit> . stat <dig> binds to akt <dig> promoter was confirmed by chip assay  <cit> , suggesting that a kt maybe a direct transcriptional target of stat <dig>  akt, on the other hand, inhibits stat <dig> transcriptional activity and phosphorylation  <cit> . decreased akt gene expression seen after deletion of stat <dig> may represent a direct effect of stat <dig> deficiency or to a negative regulatory response to stat <dig> deficiency, 2) akt activation induces both srebf <dig> and srebf <dig> mrnas and proteins as well as key enzymes in the cholesterol, fatty acid and membrane lipid biosynthesis pathways  <cit> , 3) multiple lines of evidence suggest that pi3k influences stat <dig> activation. stat <dig> binds directly to the pi3k regulatory subunits  <cit> . the expression of genes encoding for several pi3k subunits were altered after deletion of stat <dig> , supporting the involvement of pi3k/akt signaling in stat <dig> regulated bioprocesses in lung, and 4) since akt physically interacts with foxa <dig> and regulates foxa2-dependent transcriptional activity  <cit> , the effects of akt may be mediated, in part, via foxa <dig>  foxa <dig> expression was reduced more than  <dig> fold in cells from the stat3Δ/Δ mice. foxa <dig> regulates lipid metabolism in both lung and liver  <cit> . deletion of either stat <dig> or foxa <dig> resulting in decreased expression of a number of the overlapping genes that play important roles in surfactant homeostasis including abca <dig>  <cit> . thus, interactions between akt and foxa <dig> represent another potential mechanism by which lipid metabolism is influenced in stat3Δ/Δ mice.

stat <dig> influences expression of genes mediating apoptosis and cell survival
many genes modulating apoptosis/cell survival were altered in response to the deletion of stat <dig> from type ii cells, including multiple bcl- <dig> family members , caspase  <dig> , fadd-like apoptosis regulator , mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene  <dig> , prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase  <dig>  and nuclear receptor subfamily  <dig>  group c, member  <dig> . in depth literature mining identified more apoptosis related genes than did analysis by gene ontology annotation. as depicted in figure  <dig>  our study indicates that stat <dig> regulates apoptosis in a complex manner via processes that occur in multiple intracellular locations. thus, stat <dig> appears to serve as key regulator of apoptosis in alveolar type ii cells. among those apoptosis related genes, malt <dig>  ptgs <dig> and nr3c <dig> were strongly induced . malt <dig> interacts with bcl <dig> . the formation of this complex is essential for nf-kappab activation that, in turn, play a role in cell survival. ikkb phosphorylates bcl <dig> in its malt <dig> interaction domain, causing bcl <dig> and malt <dig> to disassociate, resulting in attenuation of nfkb signaling and cytokine production  <cit> . ptgs <dig> also known as cox- <dig>  a key enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis, that is highly expressed in alveolar type ii cells. the expression of ptgs <dig> is increased in epithelial tumors, including non-small cell lung and prostate cancers via activation of the il-6/gp130/stat <dig> signaling pathway  <cit> . this pathway could contribute to tumor formation by promotion of tumor cell resistance to apoptosis via inhibitor of apoptosis -dependent mechanism  <cit> . consistent with these observations, ptgs <dig>  il6st and two of the iap family members  were correspondingly induced in stat3Δ/Δ cells . nr3c <dig>  encodes a receptor for glucocorticoids that can act as both a transcription factor and as a regulator of other transcription factors. stat <dig> and nr3c <dig> physically interact to mediate effect of glucocorticoid on the il-6-mediated inflammatory response  <cit> . nr3c <dig> also interacts with stress-responsive transcription factors , mitogen activated protein kinase  <dig>  and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, epsilon polypeptide , a 14-3- <dig> family of proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of small cell lung cancer  <cit> .

stat <dig> is likely to regulate apoptosis by multiple mechanisms including gene transcription. bcl-xl is the direct transcription target of stat <dig> <cit> . stat <dig> can serve as an anti-apoptotic factor by transcriptional up-regulating the expression of bcl-xl  <cit> . the decrease of bcl-xl may represent a direct response to stat <dig> deletion. the fact that expression of bcl-xl blocked the apoptotic effects of the adenovirus in lung injury suggested that bcl-xl may mediate the role of stat <dig> in the regulation and survival of the respiratory epithelium  <cit> . the pi3k-akt pathway represents a second mechanism by which stat <dig> influences cytoprotection. pi3k-akt signaling mediates a wide range of down stream targets to regulate apoptosis  <cit> . for example, akt phosphorylates multiple bcl- <dig> family members, including bad and bcl-xl  <cit> , inhibits caspase  <dig> activation  <cit>  and blocks cytochrome c release from mitochondria  <cit> . another mechanism by which stat <dig> modulates apoptosis is through protein-protein interactions. bcl-xl is a direct transcriptional target of stat3; bcl-xl interacts with vdac <dig> to regulate the outer mitochondrial membrane channel induce apoptosis  <cit> . casp <dig> can interact with multiple apoptosis proteins including cflar, birc <dig> and  <dig>  bcl <dig> and app  <cit> . the expression of casp <dig> as well as its interaction partners was induced in stat3Δ/Δ mice. nr3c <dig> has both pro- and anti-apoptotic effects. nr3c <dig> physically interact with stat <dig>  hif1a, mapk <dig>  ywhal  <cit> ; these stress-responsive transcription factors and signaling molecules were largely induced in the present array from stat3Δ/Δ type ii alveolar epithelial cells. the close transcriptional communication and physical interactions among these transcriptional regulators likely play a critical role in regulating the balance of apoptosis and cell survival. in the present study, effects of stat <dig> deletion were assessed in type ii epithelial cells purified from the adult mouse lung. mrna was isolated immediately after isolation to avoid cell culture dependent alteration in gene expression. it is possible that the cells have undergone added cellular stress during protease treatment, isolation and purification, which in turn may influence the expression of genes. our results support the view that stat <dig> regulates the balance between a subset of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes, determining the cell death or survival through multiple mechanisms. consistent with the present microarray prediction, cleaved caspase- <dig> and tunel positive cells were significantly increased in stat3Δ/Δ mice following adenoviral infection and the apoptosis can be blocked by expression of bcl-xl  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our previous studies demonstrated that stat <dig> plays critical role in cyto-protection during lung injury  <cit> . present data support the role of stat <dig> in enhancing epithelial cell survival and surfactant lipid synthesis that contribute to the maintenance of lung function. deletion of stat <dig> from type ii alveolar epithelial cells induced the expression of the genes regulating protein metabolism, protein transport, chemotaxis and apoptosis while decreasing the expression of genes regulating lipid synthesis and metabolism. critical to pulmonary function during injury, stat <dig> influences the expression of genes regulating surfactant lipid synthesis and surfactant homeostasis including abca <dig>  as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the present study identified a complex regulatory network by which stat <dig> regulates gene expression in type ii alveolar cells that is required for cellular homeostasis following injury. stat <dig> likely interacts with akt/foxa <dig> in the regulation a number of biological processes in alveolar type ii cells, including cell survival/apoptosis, cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis required for surfactant homeostasis and lung function.
