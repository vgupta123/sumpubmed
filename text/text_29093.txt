BACKGROUND
coccidiosis is an economically important intestinal disease of poultry caused by parasitic eimeria species. the annual cost of coccidiosis to the poultry industry worldwide has been estimated to exceed Â£ <dig> billion  <cit> . control of this disease in intensively reared poultry is accomplished principally by prophylactic chemotherapy with specific anticoccidial drugs, although drug-resistance is a serious problem that has to be constantly managed. no new drugs have been introduced in recent years and alternative methods of control are now required. vaccination using live vaccines is a viable option, though it is hampered by the complexity and production constraints of live parasites. thus, new approaches for control continue to be sought.

eimeria tenella is widely considered to be the most economically relevant and well known of the seven eimeria species that cause coccidiosis in chickens  <cit> . the second generation merozoite of eimeria is an interesting target for transcriptomic studies as it is the progeny derived from the most pathogenic endogenous stage of the e. tenella life cycle  <cit>  and may contribute to the stimulation of the protective immune response in the host for at least some eimeria species  <cit> . in addition, it is among the most readily isolated stages of the life cycle  <cit> . detailed study of the merozoite stage will support the identification of proteins important to key biological processes in the parasite including host invasion, replication, pathogenicity and the stimulation of host immunity.

the availability of segments of sequences from randomly selected cdna clones, known as expressed sequence tags , has provided valuable resources for the identification and study of genes in e. tenella  <cit> . sequencing of full-length cdnas provides additional advantages including data derived from a single clone rather than an assembly of multiple ests, which can generate ambiguous contigs, and complete transcripts, which include open reading frames  and untranslated regions . thus, a large collection of full-length cdna sequences provides a set of protein coding sequences that facilitate the prediction of gene identity and function by comparison with other known protein coding genes  <cit> .

in this study, partial sequences were generated from the 5' and 3' ends of randomly selected clones of an e. tenella second generation merozoite full-length cdna library. these partial sequences were pre-processed and subsequent sequence clustering and primer walking generated full-length cdna sequences. characterisation of these full-length cdna sequences included determination and analysis of orfs and utrs, kozak sequence consensus, simple sequence repeats  and codon usage. analysis of the full-length cdna sequences generated also identified candidate secretory and membrane proteins that may prove relevant in developing disease control strategies against avian coccidiosis.

RESULTS
generation of full-length cdna sequences
a total of  <dig>  clones were randomly selected for plasmid extraction and subsequent single-pass sequencing from the 5' and 3' ends. after eliminating low quality and vector contaminated sequences,  <dig>  and  <dig>  good quality sequences were obtained from the 5' and 3' ends respectively . these partial sequences were clustered and resulted in the identification of  <dig>  unique transcripts . using the clustered sequences  <dig> full-length cdna sequences were generated by aligning overlapping 5' and 3' end partial sequences. in addition, clones representing  <dig> consensus sequences with both 5' and 3' end partial sequences were randomly selected and subjected to complete sequencing by single-pass primer walking, generating a further  <dig> full-length cdna sequences. primary sequence analysis revealed the absence of in-frame start or stop codons in one and  <dig> clones respectively. such sequences might represent non-coding rnas, although they could also have been derived from contaminants or cloning artefacts and have been excluded from our subsequent analyses. thus, a total of  <dig> full-length cdna sequences were generated and analysed in this study .

functional annotation
blastx similarity search of the  <dig>  uts against the genbank non-redundant database revealed that  <dig> %  of the transcripts had significant matches  to publicly available gene sequences, with most of these  matches to gene sequences from apicomplexan parasites . a total of  <dig>  gene ontology  terms, distributed within the categories biological process, molecular function and cellular component, were assigned to the  <dig>  uts  . the most highly represented subcategories within biological process were cellular and metabolic processes, accounting for  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the transcripts respectively, in line with previous proteomic characterisation of the second generation merozoite  <cit> . binding  and catalytic activity  were the most highly represented subcategories within molecular function. combined, these results are consistent with the biological role of the second generation merozoite, a life cycle stage characterised by metabolically active processes including motility within the caeca, host cell attachment and cellular invasion. the cellular component category was dominated by the cell  and organelle  subcategories, consistent with the relatively high abundance of cell cycle-associated proteins reported in the second generation merozoite proteome compared to the sporozoite  <cit> . go annotation of the e. tenella full-length cdna sequences revealed similar functional patterns .

cdna, orf and utr length distribution
analysis of the  <dig> e. tenella full-length cdna sequences revealed an average size of  <dig>  bp . most of the sequences were in the length range of  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp, while  <dig> %  of the sequences were within  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp and  <dig> %  were within  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp. the analysis also showed that  <dig> sequences generated were less than  <dig>  bp in length and two sequences were more than  <dig>  bp in length. our analysis of the previously reported  <dig> full-length cdna sequences from toxoplasma gondii  <cit>  and  <dig> full-length cdna sequences from cryptosporidium parvum  <cit>  revealed average sizes of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp respectively. comparison of the three data sets revealed longer average full-length cdna sequences within the e. tenella transcriptome. while the difference was not statistically significant, variation in transcriptome-wide ssr prevalence between the three data sets is clearly a contributory factor .

the sequences were also analysed to predict orf and utr components following start and stop codon identification . length distribution analysis of the  <dig> predicted orfs showed that the majority were between  <dig> to  <dig> bp in length, with the average size being  <dig> bp . approximately  <dig> %  of the orfs were less than  <dig> bp, while only  <dig> %  of the orfs were more than  <dig>  bp. the length distribution of the 5'utrs showed that few exceeded  <dig> bp , with the average size of the 5'utr being  <dig> bp. the length distribution of the 3'utrs showed that  <dig> %  were more than  <dig> bp long, with the average size of the 3'utr being  <dig> bp.

although the 5'utr does not contribute directly to the encoded protein, the characterisation of 5'utr features is important as this region is believed to be involved in the control of translation and transcription processes that subsequently reflect gene expression  <cit> . thus, data generated on these regions may reveal control elements and regulatory mechanisms of gene expression patterns in the parasite. in a previous study of apicomplexan full-length cdna sequences, wakaguri et al  <cit>  reported that the average size of 5'utrs was consistent amongst plasmodium species, namely p. falciparum , p. vivax , p. yoelii  and p. berghei , but varied between genera with c. parvum and t. gondii presenting average 5'utr lengths of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp respectively. the average 5'utr length was shortest for c. parvum, which may reflect the fact that both the genome size and the average gene size are the smallest in this species. this comparison has revealed longer 5'utrs in the e. tenella genome than reported for most other apicomplexan parasites. while the significance of this finding is not yet clear the detection of numerous ssrs may once again be a contributory factor.

genomic cdna transcript mapping-e. tenella chromosome 1
eimeria tenella is the first of the eimeria species parasites to have been subjected to genome sequencing, although the draft assembly remains fragmented  <cit> . in order to demonstrate the utility of the data generated here for gene prediction the  <dig>  uts and  <dig> full-length cdna sequences were mapped onto the first sequenced e. tenella chromosome , representing ~ <dig> % of the genome  <cit> . based on an overlap of at least 70% of the original transcript length, a total of  <dig> uts were successfully mapped-seven to genes in the feature-poor 'p'-regions and the remaining six to genes in the feature-rich 'r'-regions of the chromosome . further analysis revealed that mapping of the ut sequences identified and resolved several inconsistencies with the previously predicted coding regions, indicating the usefulness of the transcript sequences in improving gene structure prediction on the e. tenella genome sequence. two full-length cdna transcripts were mapped to e. tenella chromosome  <dig>  where the alignment of ln23_etm023c <dig> showed consistency with the previously characterised 15-exon structure of the glucose-6-phosphate isomerase gene  <cit> .

ssr motif analysis
ssrs can be found in the genome of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms  <cit> . these repeats represent a rich source of hypervariable markers due to the constant allelic changes of array length caused by their high mutation rate  <cit> . as a result, they have been widely used in the fields of linkage mapping  <cit> , population genetics  <cit>  and phylogenetic or comparative genomic research  <cit> . in addition, ssrs are believed to be important in genome evolution, stimulating the development of genetic variability  <cit>  and influencing gene expression  <cit> .

a notable feature of e. tenella chromosome  <dig> was the abundance of ssrs, not only in the introns and intergenic regions, but also in the predicted coding regions  <cit> . in order to further characterise the type and location of these repeated motifs in e. tenella genes, ssr motif analysis was carried out on the full-length cdna sequences generated. results showed that the ssrs present were composed of various types of mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, hexa-, hepta-, nona- and decanucleotides . the location of the ssrs were subsequently categorised to three different locations, i.e. 5'utr, orf and 3'utr. based on the distribution of the ssrs trinucleotide motifs were found to be the most abundant , with mono- and tetranucleotide motifs also found to be common. the trinucleotide cag was the most abundant motif and constituted  <dig> %  of the entire trinucleotide motifs identified, while the most abundant tetranucleotide motif was agct, which comprised of  <dig> %  of all tetranucleotide motifs. a total of eight hexanucleotide, two heptanucleotide, two nonanucleotide and one decanucleotide motifs were also identified in the e. tenella full-length cdna sequences. the abundance of cag trinucleotide motifs within the e. tenella full-length cdna sequences was consistent with the published findings from e. tenella chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . comparison with publicly available full-length cdna sequences from c. parvum  <cit>  and t. gondii  <cit>  revealed the dominance of mononucleotide repeats for the former, but dinucleotide repeats for the latter . surprisingly, t. gondii full-length cdna sequences were found to contain only mono-, di- and trinucleotide repeats, while penta-, hepta-, octa-, nona- and decanucleotide motifs were also found to be absent in c. parvum. as expected, the highest ssr content was observed in e. tenella.

codon usage analysis
codon usage often varies between organisms and may reflect the cellular location of gene products  <cit>  and aid in coding region determination  <cit> . codon usage in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes is known to be affected by directional mutation of nucleotides present in the genome  <cit>  and may be influenced by the composition of a genome's transfer rna  portfolio. thus, genomic evolution frequently demonstrates genome-specific over- or under-representation of some dinucleotides, and dinucleotide frequency is believed to influence codon usage  <cit> . dinucleotides that are under-represented in coding regions thus appear as codons that are present at low frequency. in this study, the orfs identified were subjected to codon usage analysis using codonw and a codon usage table for full-length e. tenella orfs was subsequently generated consisting of  <dig>  codons . a previous study of codon usage by parasites including babesia bovis, theileria parva, t. gondii and e. tenella showed that codons cga, cgg and ugu are infrequently used by all of these organisms  <cit> . for e. tenella, it was revealed that based on the frequency of usage of less than  <dig> per  <dig> codons,  <dig> codons  are infrequently used. six of these codons contain either the ua or au dinucleotide, while another four contain the cg dinucleotide. in this study, analysis of the e. tenella orf sequences identified ten codons  that are infrequently used based on the same criterion. comparison between these two studies revealed that all ten of the codons identified in this study are the same as those identified by ellis et al  <cit> . furthermore, six of them also contained either the ua or au dinucleotide while two of them contained the cg dinucleotide, supporting the finding of the previous study that codons with low usage frequency contain under-represented ua, au or cg dinucleotides. five codons were over-represented , although for gca and cag this may have been skewed by the ssr distribution.

*codon usage values given are the frequency per  <dig> codons.

determination of consensus sequence of translational initiation sites from full-length cdna sequences of e. tenella
start codons derived from the  <dig> full-length cdna sequences were aligned to observe the consensus sequence of translational initiation sites  in e. tenella. a clear consensus sequence was identified with a dominating at positions - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  while g dominated at position + <dig>  however, at position - <dig>  two bases ie. c and g were found to co-dominate. thus, the kozak sequence aaaatgg can be assigned for e. tenella genes . in a previous study  <cit> , a total of  <dig> t. gondii gene sequences from position - <dig> relative to the atg start codon up to position + <dig> were compared. a consensus sequence was apparent with a dominating at positions - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  plus c at position - <dig> and g at position + <dig>  thus, the kozak sequence caaaatgg was assigned for t. gondii. comparison of the kozak sequences for e. tenella and t. gondii shows a high similarity where a at positions - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  and g at position + <dig> for both organisms are similar. however, the kozak sequence for both of these organisms appears to differ from that of the higher eukaryotes  <cit>  .

secretory and membrane protein prediction
parasite secreted proteins commonly interact with host cells at the molecular level and are exposed to the host immune system. parasite growth and invasion processes may be prevented once an essential secretory protein is inhibited. therefore, many secretory proteins can be considered to be vaccine candidates or potential drug targets  <cit> . prediction analysis using signalp suggested that  <dig> %  of the peptide sequences contain a signal peptide. out of these  <dig> peptide sequences,  <dig> were predicted to contain one or more transmembrane domains and/or a gpi-anchor, leaving  <dig> as predicted unbound secretory proteins. similarity searches based upon homology showed that a large proportion of these predicted secretory proteins could not be assigned a putative function as  <dig> %  had matches with hypothetical proteins or proteins with unknown function, while  <dig> %  had no significant similarity to any publicly available protein sequence . intriguingly, although most of the putative secretory proteins identified were apparent homologues of apicomplexan genes no recognised apical organellar proteins were found.

many apicomplexan surface proteins have been shown to play an important role in the pathogenicity of these parasites and a number of them are potential vaccine candidates or drug targets. proteins that are attached via a gpi-anchor to the surface of protozoan parasites can induce a variety of host immunological responses  <cit> . in this study, membrane proteins were predicted by identifying the presence of signal peptides, transmembrane domains and gpi-anchors. the prediction of transmembrane helices carried out using tmhmm revealed a total of  <dig> peptide sequences likely to contain at least a single transmembrane domain. gpi-anchor prediction analysis carried out using gpi-som, which detects both the n-terminal signal peptide and c-terminal gpi-anchor signal, suggested a total of  <dig> peptides with a gpi-anchor. protein sequences that contain a signal peptide and a transmembrane domain or a gpi-anchor were predicted to be membrane proteins. based on these criteria,  <dig> membrane proteins were predicted in this study. database similarity searches showed that putative functions could not be assigned to most of the predicted membrane proteins as  <dig> %  were most similar to hypothetical proteins, while  <dig> %  had no significant similarity with sequences in the genbank database . in total  <dig> %  of the predicted membrane proteins had matches with e. tenella surface antigens . two proteins had a perfect match with members from the previously described a family   <cit> . interestingly, seven other predicted surface proteins showed between  <dig> % and  <dig> % similarity to the entire coding region length of the etsags. using multiple sequence alignment these sequences can be divided into two groups, representing the a and b families . the alignments show the presence of the six conserved cysteine residues in both families. family a revealed a mosaic pattern with conserved and variable regions distributed throughout the alignment while family b exhibited a more biased pattern with variation predominantly in the n-terminal half of the alignment, consistent with the analysis described by tabares et al.  <cit> . this analysis strongly suggests that the surface antigens discovered in this study represent new members of the etsag families. both of the previously annotated etsags identified in this study had been reported to be expressed in second generation merozoites  <cit> . using go many of the other putative membrane proteins were classified as involved in cellular and metabolic processes; for example identification of a putative longevity-assurance  domain-containing protein. as described elsewhere such molecules can present opportunities to disrupt parasite infection and thus have the potential to become good targets for novel intervention strategies  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we generated and analysed  <dig> full-length cdna sequences with complete coding regions derived from the e. tenella second generation merozoite transcriptome. these sequences provide access to a relatively large resource of nucleotide and amino acids sequences for e. tenella that will support a better understanding of the transcriptome of this economically relevant parasite. moreover, in combination with other genomic resources including whole genome sequences and genome maps  <cit> , these full-length cdna sequences will offer new insights into the structure, composition and function of the e. tenella genome. we have also identified panels of  <dig> and  <dig> predicted secretory and membrane proteins, with potential for development as novel diagnostic and/or control strategies for e. tenella via molecular techniques.
