BACKGROUND
the centrosome is an approximately one micrometre-cubed organelle that acts as the microtubule organising centre in higher eukaryotic cells  <cit> . it consists of two cylindrical centrioles, built from microtubules, surrounded by a protein matrix. during cell division, the centrosome is duplicated contemporaneously with dna and the two centrosomes contribute to the formation of the poles of the mitotic spindle that segregate the duplicated chromosomes faithfully between daughter cells  <cit> . for almost a century, the centrosome was seen as an essential component of the cell cycle, especially mitosis  <cit> : frog eggs with no centrosomes do not divide  <cit> ; sea urchin eggs with too many undergo multipolar divisions  <cit> .

the requirement of centrosomes for cell division has been severely tested over the last few years. in cell culture, the centrosome can be removed or obliterated with a laser and the cell will still divide  <cit> . in drosophila, mitotic centrosomes are not necessary for the development of the centrosomin mutant  <cit> . dsas- <dig> mutant flies can even develop to maturity in the absence of centrosomes  <cit> , although they rely on maternal stores of protein for early embryogenesis  <cit>  and they die soon after hatching by drowning in their food or from dehydration  <cit> . this raises the question of what is the precise role of the metazoan centrosome and what all the hundred or so proteins in the complex do. part of the answer might lie in the other cellular structure that is formed from centrioles.

basal bodies are centriole-like structures observed underneath the cell membrane at the base of cilia, hair-like extensions of the cell membrane  <cit> . these cilia range from the highly motile, such as those that line the trachea, to the immotile and highly specialised, such as the connecting cilium to the outer segments of photoreceptors  <cit> . virtually all vertebrate cells have a cilium  <cit> , though for many cell types the seemingly inactive primary cilium has the appearance of a relic organelle  <cit> . the basal bodies can be made from the pre-existing centrosomal centrioles that migrate to the surface, with duplication in multi-ciliated cells, or de novo  <cit> .

research into the cilium has undergone a resurgence recently with their linkage to a number of inherited human diseases and the discovery of their role in a number of important developmental processes  <cit> . primary cilia dyskinesia  was shown to be due to abnormal cilia in the mid-seventies  <cit> . more recently, polycystic kidney disease  has been linked to the condition of cilia in the kidney tubules  <cit> . cilia in the node, a fluid-filled compartment also known as kupffer's vesicle in zebrafish  <cit> , are involved in initiation of left-right asymmetry  <cit>  this explains the situs inversus often associated with pcd  <cit>  and observed in a targeted mouse mutant for the gene, tg <dig>  which encodes the polaris protein  <cit> . this mutant, an allele of the tg737orpk hypomorph which models pkd  <cit> , affects the mouse homologue of the chlamydomonas ift <dig> protein  <cit> , one of the family of intraflagellar transport proteins  that move other proteins up and down the cilium in conjunction with motor proteins.

bardet-biedl, alstrom and oral-facial-digital syndromes are a number of other human diseases described whose pleiotropic and overlapping symptoms include polycystic kidney disease, situs inversus, retinal dystrophy and neurological problems  <cit> . the products of the genes mutated in these diseases localise to centrosomes and basal bodies of cilia  <cit> .

a large portion of the centrosome inventory consists of novel and uncharacterised proteins often with no domains to give clues as to their cellular function  <cit> . we therefore set out to screen this list for proteins with developmental roles by systematically depleting them from zebrafish embryos using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides. this model system enables us to rapidly work through the centrosome inventory in a vertebrate host with fast and experimentally accessible tissue and organ development. here, we analyse two genes involved in centrosome function. the absence of either gene in zebrafish results in 'ciliary' phenotypes, which closely resemble those of zebrafish mutants for intraflagellar transport genes   <cit> .

RESULTS
we conducted a pilot screen for centrosome proteins with developmental roles, injecting zebrafish embryos with morpholinos directed against the mrnas for thirty centrosomal proteins that have been identified, focussing primarily on those that had not been well characterised. we were able to identify seven morpholinos that, upon early injection, resulted in morphological phenotypes . two morphants particularly caught our attention. embryos injected with morpholinos against the zebrafish homologues of cep <dig> and cep <dig>  <cit>  displayed a curved back, slightly shortened body axis and ectopic otoliths were frequently observed  at  <dig> hours post-fertilisation  . both morpholinos gave a robust and highly penetrant phenotype.

we initially tested the effectiveness of these morpholinos against the desired sequence by modifying gfp to include the morpholino target site 5' and in-frame to the coding sequence and co-injecting mrna for this construct with the morpholino. as expected, gfp fluorescence in the embryos was practically eliminated, which was not the case if a control morpholino was injected .

to show the specificity of the effect of depleting the proteins, we next tried to use splicing inhibitory morpholinos for both genes. morpholinos were designed that bound the intron  <dig> – exon  <dig> junction of the predicted pre-mrna of each gene. in both cases, a very similar phenotype of curved back and ectopic otoliths  was observed, although it was less severe for cep <dig> compared to the translation-inhibiting morpholino . for each gene, then, two different morpholinos operating by different mechanisms – translation inhibition and inhibition of splicing – gave a very similar morphant phenotype. we used rt-pcr to assay if the level of mrna of each gene had been reduced. in both cases, significant reduction was observed, though this was greater in the case of cep <dig> than cep <dig>  as might be expected from the phenotype . we used the translation-inhibiting morpholinos in subsequent experiments as the severity of the phenotype suggests a greater level of depletion.

we cloned both cep <dig> and cep <dig> by rt-pcr from  <dig> h.p.f. zebrafish embryos and raised antibodies to recombinant zebrafish cep <dig> overexpressed in e. coli and affinity purified. the recombinant protein was recognised by sera from rabbits immunised with zebrafish cep70; one serum was used for subsequent experiments .

in both zebrafish pc <dig> cells and two-day old zebrafish embryo extracts, a band at the expected size could be detected by the rabbit anti-cep <dig> serum, as well as a low molecular weight band in the cell line extracts. this protein was difficult to detect in embryos by western blotting .

immunofluorescence microscopy of pc <dig> cells labelled with anti-cep <dig> antibody revealed a punctate, perinuclear pattern that coincided with that of gamma tubulin  and was absent from cells probed with the pre-immune serum. as expected, gfp-cep <dig> and gfp-cep <dig> localised to the centrosome . two dots of signal were observed , strongly suggesting that these are present on or around both centrioles and not localised to one specific centriole or mother centriole-specific structures like the distal appendages.

in  <dig> h.p.f. embryos, gfp-cep <dig> localises to the apical surface of cells in the otic vesicle  and eye  with a punctate appearance. this can be replicated with wholemount immunofluorescence staining of  <dig> h.p.f. embryos with rabbit anti-cep <dig> 485- <dig> . this staining coincides with that of mouse monoclonal gtu- <dig> to gamma tubulin which labels centrosomes and basal bodies  and lies at the base of cilia labelled with mouse monoclonal 6-11b- <dig> to acetylated tubulin , shown in detail in fig. 3h and inset. in the otic vesicle there is non-specific staining of the otoliths but in other ciliated tissues, only the basal bodies are labelled , i , j ). in ciliated cells, therefore, cep <dig> localises to the basal bodies of cilia.

the morphological phenotype of the cep <dig> and cep <dig> morphants is similar to the zebrafish oval and hippi mutants, in which the zebrafish homologues of ift88/tg737orpk/polaris and ift <dig> are disrupted  <cit> . it has been found that defective cilia formation is the main cause for the phenotype of these embryos with altered ift function. we reasoned that the cellular cause of the phenotype we observed should also lie in the state of embryonic cilia rather than the centrosomes themselves.

we used confocal microscopy to analyse  <dig> h.p.f. morphant embryos, which were labelled for both gamma tubulin and acetylated tubulin. these mark centrosomes or basal bodies  and stabilised microtubules found in the axonemes of cilia . we examined the cilia in the spinal canal, pronephros and otic vesicle. motile cilia in the central canal of the spinal cord and pump fluid down this tube  <cit> . in the cep <dig> and cep <dig> morphants, these cilia are reduced in size from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   respectively .

in zebrafish, motile cilia drive fluid flow down the tubules of the pronephros. in some ift morphants, the pronephros expands to form a visible bubble at the head of the pronephros and histological sections of these embryos reveal much expanded pronephric ducts and tubule  <cit> . we did not observe such a severe phenotype although paraffin sections of cep <dig> morphants embryos showed a significant expansion in the ducts, which can also be observed in the confocal images of the ducts at an earlier stage . this morphant phenotype is similar to that found in oval mutants, in which the pronephric cysts are mild compared to other mutants  <cit> . analysis of the cilia in the pronephric ducts by confocal microscopy revealed a reduction in the length of the cilia from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm in cep <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  in cep <dig> morphants . however, basal bodies are still present in these cells, beneath the shortened cilia, so the effect on cilia is not due to the absence of centrioles and basal bodies from which the cilia extend.

the otic vesicles in zebrafish contain two types of cilia: two sets of long, tether cilia  are surrounded by short, motile cilia about  <dig> μm long  <cit> . the former anchor the two otoliths normally observed in zebrafish embryos at this stage. the latter move the vesicle fluid that contains the calcium-protein particles that aggregate to form the otoliths. in the absence of effective cilia, these aggregates can form ectopically, rather than on the tether cilia  <cit> . the motile cilia themselves are too short to accurately compare the length between morphant and wild-type by immunofluorescence microscopy. by visual inspection, the size of the tether cilia, much longer than the motile cilia in the rest of the vesicle, is not obviously affected . in both morphants, basal bodies are still present in the ciliated cells and centrosomes in the surrounding tissue. similar observations have been made with the oval mutant, in which ectopic otoliths are observed but the cilia of the otic vesicle appear normal  <cit>  whereas other cilia – spine, pronephros – are shortened  <cit> .

we next asked if other processes in which cilia are involved were also affected in these morphants. the kupffer's vesicle  is the zebrafish equivalent of the node in mouse embryos and harbours motile cilia, which are crucially involved in determining left-right laterality in both brain and body. the absence of these cilia or their lack of motility results in left and right in the developing embryos being randomly assigned  <cit> . organs and tissues that are asymmetrically placed, such as the heart, liver, pancreas or parapineal, are on opposite sides to wild-type embryos  in approximately half of the cep <dig>  and cep <dig>  morphant embryos affected , as revealed by wholemount in situ hybridisation with rna probes to otx <dig> and fkd <dig>  <cit>  . the placement of liver and parapineal is not established concordantly . we examined the kv by confocal microscopy, revealing no obvious changes in size and shape in cep <dig> morphants; cep <dig> morphant kvs were smaller . however, the cilia in the vesicles of both morphants are again much shorter, vestigial cilia of  <dig>  μm  compared to 2– <dig> μm  for those in normal embryos.

defects in convergence and extension have been shown for some cilium morphants, such as the bbs proteins  <cit> . cep <dig> morphants have a phenotype similar to some mutants, such as silberblick and trilobite, whose role in convergence-extension are well established  <cit> . at the end of epiboly, cep <dig> morphant embryos adopt an acorn shape and part of the yolk is squeezed out as the germ ring contracts ; their body axis is also shorter . we assayed the effectiveness of convergence and extension in cep <dig> embryos by wholemount in situ hybridisation of tailbud stage embryos with rna probes to dlx <dig> and hgg <dig>  <cit> , which label the anterior neural margin and prechordal plate. in convergence-extension mutants, there is a significant gap between the two, which is absent in wild-type embryos   <cit> . such a gap is also absent in cep <dig> morphants  so, by this assay, early convergence-extension is proceeding normally.

to investigate the cellular function of cep <dig> and cep <dig> in more detail, we analysed the peptide sequence of both proteins. both cep <dig> and cep <dig> are coiled-coil proteins proposed by the smart protein analysis tool to have a histone deacetylase-interacting domain  located in the middle of the peptide chain. hdac <dig> is, in fact, also a tubulin deacetylase  <cit>  so these domains could be relevant to the function of these proteins in ciliogenesis. cep <dig> also possesses an iq domain in its n-terminus. to assess whether these domains are responsible for centrosomal association or function of these proteins, we expressed both cep <dig> and cep <dig> as fragments in pc <dig> cells. the hdac-id-containing half of cep <dig> did indeed localise to the centrosome  whereas the other half of the protein only showed a cytoplasmic staining . the behaviour of the cep <dig> fragments is more complex. on its own, the n-terminal third minus the hdac-id displays nuclear localisation ; only a fragment containing both the native n-terminus, iq and hdac-id domains shows centrosomal localisation . other fragments form cytoplasmic aggregrates that do not always co-localise with the centrosome . none of these fragments had any notable effects on the cells, apart from at high expression levels where the large aggregates appeared to be toxic.

we tried to rescue the cep <dig> morphant by co-injecting, sequentially, the morpholino against cep <dig> and an mrna encoding the n-terminal half of cep <dig>  this protein fragment, when injected at moderate to high amounts , resulted in severe defects and toxicity and did not rescue the morphant, presumably reflecting the effect of the aggregates that can form in transfected cells .

to test for interaction between these proteins we used the yeast two-hybrid assay with these combinations: cep <dig> against cep131; either cep <dig> or cep <dig> against hdac6; and either cep <dig> or cep <dig> versus members of the ift family of proteins . we could not detect any interaction between cep <dig> or cep <dig> and hdac <dig>  ift <dig>  ift <dig> or ift <dig>  cep <dig> and cep <dig> did not interact with each other by this assay but cep <dig> did bind itself . as it is a predicted coiled-coil protein, this is not surprising.

lastly, we looked at the ultrastructure of basal bodies and centrioles in cep <dig> morphant zebrafish embryos but could observe no difference to the wild-type organelles : all nine triplet microtubules of basal bodies or centrioles appeared intact and axonemes could be observed emerging from the basal bodies in the brain, where hydrocephaly is observed . unlike some mutants with similar phenotypes  there were no obvious, gross defects in the centrioles. whilst we cannot exclude the possibility of fine ultrastructural changes in the tissues affected, centrioles and basal bodies are clearly present in the embryo so the ciliary-related defects are not due to a global absence of centrioles.

discussion
the gross anatomical phenotype of the morphants depleted for cep <dig> or cep <dig> – the extra otoliths and curved back – have been observed before in zebrafish morphants in intraflagellar transport proteins. in the case of ift <dig> and ift <dig> morphants, as for cep <dig> and cep <dig> morphants, cilia are shortened but not completely eliminated in kupffer's vesicle, the spine and pronephros  <cit> . cilia disappear at later stages  in eye and ear in the oval mutant   <cit> . centrosomes and basal bodies/centrioles are still present in cep <dig> and cep <dig> morphants so the organelle that seems to be most vulnerable to depletion of these proteins is the cilium rather than the basal body/centriole from which it grows. with the levels of depletion we achieve, although the cilia are much reduced in length, they are not completely eliminated. indeed, similar to vladar and stearns  <cit> , graser and nigg  <cit>  have found that a number, but by no means all, centrosome proteins contribute to ciliogenesis of the primary cilium of cultured retinal pigmented epithelial cells. so far though, only one, cep <dig>  can be depleted with almost complete elimination of cilia but preservation of the basal body  <cit> , similar to the 'end-point' of the oval mutant  <cit> .

the motile cilia of the otic vesicle are already of a size to which other cilia in the cep70/ <dig> and ift57/ <dig> morphants are reduced. this might make them resistant to defects in the ciliogenesis pathway in which cep <dig> and cep <dig> are involved that reduce the length of other cilia. any proportional changes in length would also not be accurately measurable with our techniques. the motility of the cilia could still be impaired, which would also result in the formation of the ectopic otoliths observed. the tether cilia appear normal whereas, based on the pronephric cilia, one would expect a clear, visible reduction in length to that of the neighbouring motile cilia. subtle differences between cilia and cell types in different tissues could render these proteins redundant in certain cells. it is not the case that depletion of any centriolar protein has the same effect on all cilia in the zebrafish embryo. depletion of ift proteins in zebrafish affects nearly all cilia  <cit> . zebrafish morphants for the bardet-biedl syndrome genes show normal eye development, do not exhibit a curved back or ectopic otoliths but do display randomisation of left-right asymmetry  <cit> . morphants of the joubert syndrome/nephronophthisis-associated protein cep <dig> have certain defects with cerebellum morphology and have kidney cysts but both length and movement of the pronephric cilia is unaffected  <cit> . indeed, zhao and malicki have recently identified a set of zebrafish mutants in which subsets of cilia are affected although the subcellular localisation of the gene products has yet to be determined  <cit> .

morphants for zebrafish ift <dig> and ift <dig> homologues closely but not completely resemble the two morphants described here, both at the gross anatomical, cellular and subcellular level  <cit> . ift57/ <dig> morphants show reduced cilia length in the kv, pronephros and spine central canal as we observe in the two cep70/ <dig> morphants. the ift family of proteins might therefore contain candidate partner proteins. however, we could not detect an interaction between cep <dig> or cep <dig> and several of the ift proteins. our search was limited, though, and it remains possible that, as more of these proteins are identified, one member of the ift family could still be the partner for these two proteins.

other proteins that could be partners of both cep <dig> and cep <dig> are the histone deacetylases as both ceps possess hdac interacting domains. however, the exact role of these domains is not immediately obvious. the hdac that deacetylates tubulin reverses ciliogenesis  <cit> . unless these ceps sequester hdac <dig> at the basal body, localising active hdac <dig> to cilia via cep <dig> and cep <dig> would prevent ciliogenesis and so depleting these proteins would prevent cilium reabsorbtion or deciliation. whilst the hdac-id of cep <dig> is in the centrosome-localising region of this protein, this domain is not the sole determinant of centrosomal localisation in cep <dig>  which would also suggest that these proteins would act as anchors for the enzyme, not the other way around. again, though, our assays failed to detect an interaction between these proteins. this could be a technical limitation or the hdac-id, in fact, anchors another hdac or another molecule.

CONCLUSIONS
we have described here a role for previously uncharacterised centrosome proteins, cep <dig> and cep <dig>  as contributors to ciliogenesis in certain tissues in the developing vertebrate  embryo. it is as components of the basal bodies of cilia rather than centrosome proteins per se that these proteins appear to exert their effect in these morphants. neither protein interacts with several ifts or the deacetylase hdac <dig>  which are known to have key roles in extending and maintaining cilia, so, if cep <dig> and cep <dig> are involved in these pathways, other proteins probably act as interlocutors. alternatively, these two proteins act in another pathway that controls cilium length. the resemblance of both cep <dig> and cep <dig> morphants to those of zebrafish ift <dig> and ift <dig> makes the two proteins candidates for genes mutated in inherited human diseases similar to bardet-biedl syndrome in which cilia in a number of tissues are affected. further investigation of their function should yield valuable knowledge on the function of cilia and their roles in embryonic development and disease.
