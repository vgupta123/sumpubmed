BACKGROUND
next-generation, massively-parallel sequencing technologies have transformed the landscape of genetics through their ability to produce giga-bases of sequence information in a single run. however, the sequencing cost, computation workload and amount of sample dna required are still too high for large scale population analysis by means of whole-genome sequencing. there is clearly a need for pre-sequencing capture of subsets of the genome in order to reduce these requirements. although the whole exome represents a valuable subset, its exclusion of introns, and the high cost and high dna requirement for its analysis, remain major limitations. other sequence subsets therefore clearly need to be explored.

alu-transposons are a family of primate-specific short interspersed nucleotide elements  of ~  <dig> bp derived from 7sl rna  <cit> . although alu elements were once considered as 'junk dna', their biological importance, in particular their influence on genome instability is being increasingly recognized  <cit> . they are abundant in gene-rich regions  <cit> , exert a major impact on genomic architecture  <cit> , and increase local recombination rates  <cit> . previously we have found enhanced snp frequencies in the vicinity of alu-elements  <cit> , more so among the youngest aluy elements than the intermediate-age alus and the oldest aluj. aluys display also a higher rate of methylation, consistent with a stronger silencing pressure on these elements  <cit> . genotypic variations surrounding a human lineage-specific aluy insertion in the gabrb <dig> gene encoding gabaa receptor β <dig> subunit have been found by us to constitute a joint focal point for positive evolutionary selection  <cit> , hotspot recombinations  <cit>  as well as association with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder  <cit> . neighborhoods of alu-transposons are therefore a highly significant sequence subset of the human genome in terms of evolutionary development and pathogenesis.

inter-alu pcr is a useful method for isolating human dna in the presence of animal dna  <cit> , linkage mapping  <cit> , creation of human specific probes and fingerprints  <cit> , and detection of mutator phenotypes  <cit>  or high frequency genetic alterations  <cit> . the general strategy of the method is to employ a single pcr primer based on the alu consensus sequence to amplify the sequence between two alu elements. with well over a million alu-transposons in the human genome, the average distance between two alus is only  <dig>  kb , which suggests that inter-alu pcr with an enhanced amplicon range coupled to next-generation sequencing could yield a huge sequence subset of the human genome for analysis. accordingly the objective of the present study is to examine the possibility of enhancing the amplicon range of inter-alu pcr and combining it with next generation sequencing to scan for sequence and structure variations in the human genome.

RESULTS
individual alu-transposons in the human genome are on the average only  <dig> - 20% divergent from each other, and pcr primers complementary to the alu consensus sequence have been employed for inter-alu pcr  <cit> . likewise pcr primers based on consensus sequences in the aluj, alus and aluy subfamilies could also be devised. all alu-based primers can be divided into 'h-type' where the primer extends outward from the head of the alu, or 't-type' where it extends outward from the poly-a containing tail. previously, single general alu consensus primers had given rise to agarose gel electrophoretograms displaying largely banded, banded plus smeared, or largely smeared patterns  <cit> . in the present study, varying combinations of alu, aluj, alus and/or aluy consensus primers were found to yield widely different electrophoretogram patterns. the presence of a single h-type or t-type primer tended to yield a banded, non-smeared pattern suggestive of a limited amplicon range . in lanes i and l respectively, even two or three t-type primers failed to give a non-banded pattern; lane k with three h-type primers gave a smeared pattern but lane f with two h-type primers gave only a banded pattern. in contrast, various primer combinations containing both h-type and t-type primers, allowing the amplification of intervening sequences between two alu heads, between two alu-tails as well as between one head and one tail, readily yielded a smeared gel indicating the presence of a wide diversity of amplicons of different sizes . therefore inclusion of both h-type and t-type primers provided the most reliable method for achieving huge amplicon range using no more than a small number of primers. the greater staining intensity of lane s compared to lane r further showed that the amounts of amplicons obtained from the same primer set could be increased by increasing the primer concentrations.

when aluscans were performed on paired control and cancer dnas extracted from respectively the white blood cells and glioma tissue of a male han chinese patient using the three primers aluy278t <dig>  aluy66h <dig> and r12a/ <dig> described under methods, smeared gels of amplicons up to ~  <dig> kb in size were obtained . in each case the use of  <dig> ng sample dna yielded sufficient amplicons for next-generation sequencing on the illumina platform with a single flowcell lane and  <dig> bp paired-end reads. the sequencing output has been submitted to sequence read archive  of ncbi. as indicated in table  <dig>   <dig> mb of the initial reads of control white blood cell dna were mapped using the bwa program  <cit>  to  <dig>  mb regions on the reference human genome , including high quality mapping of  <dig> mb reads to  <dig>  mb regions with minimum  <dig> times and average  <dig> times coverage. of the latter  <dig>  mb, 95% were inter-alu sequences, which compared favorably with the nimblegen seqcap exome array for targeted exon capture with typically 71% mapped reads on target  <cit> ; 53% were genic sequences including both exons and introns from  <dig>  genes, representing an enrichment of genic sequences compared to the overall 40% gene content of the human genome; and 34% of the genes belonged to the list of cancer candidate genes in gene ranker: tcga gbm  <dig>  exceeding the 26% of all human genes included in that list. the genomic regions mapped by the reads followed closely the number of alu transposons located on the chromosomes . with glioma dna,  <dig> mb of the initial reads were mapped to  <dig>  mb genomic regions, including  <dig>  mb high quality regions with minimum  <dig> times and average  <dig> times coverage. the overlap between the high quality regions mapped by the control- and glioma-reads totalled  <dig>  mb, equal to 90% of the control-mapped regions; the correlation in read coverage between control and glioma reads was high, with r =  <dig> ; the density distributions of the control and glioma reads along different chromosomes  were also highly correlated, with r =  <dig> . these results provided evidence that aluscan performed with the same set of primers enabled a reproducible genome-wide capture of dna sequences that were enriched in both genic content and cancer candidate genes despite the many overlapping inter-alu amplicons that might be amplified by a mixture of h- and t-type primers.

comparison of the mapped control and glioma sequences identified  <dig> somatic snvs between them,  <dig> % of which represented novel snvs absent from dbsnp <dig>  in the control and glioma snvs relative to the reference human genome, as well as the somatic snvs occurring between control and glioma, transitions were far more numerous than transversions . there were  <dig> instances of loss of heterozygosity  and  <dig> somatic indels between control and glioma dnas. the lohs were unequally distributed among different chromosomes . of the four particularly loh-enriched regions, viz. regions 1p, 9p, 9q and 19q indicated in figure  <dig>  notably 1p and 19q were known to contain glioma-associated deletions  <cit> , which furnished valuable cross validation between aluscan and other genomic approaches.

seven 5-mb intervals in the glioma sequences displayed enhanced numbers of somatic snvs, where the number of somatic snvs >  <dig>  indicating the potential presence of somatic snv hotspots . of these seven potential snv hotspots, those in chromosomal regions 12q <dig>  17q <dig>  18p <dig>  19p <dig> and 19q <dig> harboured altogether  <dig> snv-containing genes including rab5c of the ras oncogene family in 17q <dig> . none of these  <dig> genes were included in omim as a known glioma-associated gene. these findings illustrated the usefulness of aluscan as a discovery tool.

discussion
using only  <dig> ng sample dna in each instance, the aluscans performed in the present study with one h-type and two t-type primers generated reads that covered a total of ~58- <dig> mb, or ~ <dig> - <dig> % of genomic sequences. this total was comparable in order of magnitude to the genomic sequences in principle capturable by the set of three h and t-type consensual alu-based primers employed, which were estimated to be ~ <dig> mb for exact primer-template matches, or ~ <dig> mb allowing for one mismatched base-pair per primer , but still far below the total of  <dig>  gb inter-alu regions of ≤  <dig> kb in length in the human genome . thus there could be ample room for widening the scope of aluscan-capturable sequences through the use of diverse combinations of h- and t-type primers. primers specific for other transposable elements such as lines, ltrs, as well as other types of more specialized primers could also be utilized to tailor the aluscan capture to a given investigational goal. moreover, by treating target dna with bisulfite to modify unmethylated c-residues prior to aluscan, epigenomic changes in normal and diseased cells may also be monitored.

by combining the twin advantages of multitudinous amplification of inter-alu sequences through the joint usage of h-type and t-type primers, and massively parallel next-generation sequencing, aluscan thus provides a new method for genome-wide investigation in addition to whole genome sequencing  and whole exome sequencing . wgs is the standard in comprehensiveness, but incurs high operation cost, large computation workload and multi-microgram dna requirement. wes provides integral insight into the entire exome, but leaves the intronic regions uncharacterized, besides incurring high capture cost and multi-microgram dna requirement. aluscan permits an examination of gene-enriched segments of exons, introns and intergenic sequences requiring comparatively modest capture and sequencing costs, lighter computation workload and only sub-microgram dna samples. these three methods complement one another, together making possible a comprehensive analysis of sequence and structure variations of the human genome.

CONCLUSIONS
aluscan implemented with just a small number of pcr primers based on consensus alu sequences provides a multiplex method for genome-wide sequence analysis. through the inclusion of h and t type primers, the approach employs the abundance and wide distribution of alu elements in the human genome as the basis for the effective capture of a huge number of dna sequences in the vicinity of alu elements. as demonstrated by the strong correlation between the captured white blood cell and glioma sequences, the same set of h and t-type primers has led to an extensively reproducible subset of genomic sequences in the two separate aluscans. as well, at least for this set of h and t-type primers, the captured sequences were enriched in genic and cancer-related dna sequences.

the results in figure  <dig> illustrate the utility of aluscan as a discovery tool. comparison of the paired while blood cell-glioma dnas of a single patient has led to the uncovering of  <dig> lohs and  <dig> somatic snvs, a majority of which likely arising in the glioma, and seven potential snv hotspots located on six different chromosomes. importantly, the modest technical cost and dna sample size required for aluscan will render practicable a follow up with similarly paired aluscans for tens to hundreds of glioma patients in order to distinguish the somatic and germline driver mutations fundamental to the development of the disease from passenger mutations. a major application of aluscan will thus reside in its facilitation of large cohort studies for clinical and biological investigations of the human genome.
