BACKGROUND
as adeno-associated virus  increases in popularity as a gene therapy vector  <cit>  we need to improve our understanding of the molecular biology of aav replication. this will allow for better manipulation of aav replication and, ultimately, should greatly boost raav production. furthermore, while certain groups fail to see a correlation  <cit> , the vast majority of epidemiologic, animal, and tissue culture studies strongly suggest that aav inhibits the carcinogenesis process  <cit> . moreover, there is a long history of aav functioning as an autonomous parvovirus during specific circumstances. yakobson et al.  first observed the ability of aav to replicate productively without helper virus in cells at low levels  <cit> . others have demonstrated that a few cell lines, such as cos- <dig> cells, would allow for autonomous aav replication  <cit> . all of these early studies utilized oncogenically transformed cells and in most circumstances the cells had to be treated with a genotoxic/synchronizing agent to achieve low level aav replication. in a more recent study wang and srivastava  demonstrated that mutation of the rep <dig> binding site within the aav p <dig> promoter allowed for low levels of autonomous aav replication without genotoxic agents in hela cells  <cit> .

we have been studying autonomous aav replication in differentiating primary normal keratinocytes  as they form a stratified squamous epithelium   <cit> . aav virus particle arrays have been identified in the nucleus of aav infected differentiated keratinocytes with no concurrent adenovirus infection  <cit> . we hypothesized that aav might replicate autonomously in sse as aav has been isolated from sse at multiple body sites, including the anogenital region and the nasopharynx  <cit> . in continuing these studies primary squamous cervical cancer isolates and cell lines were surveyed for their ability to allow for aav dna replication. one primary isolate, pt <dig>  was identified which allowed for  <dig> fold higher aav dna replication levels than nk and other cervical cancer cell lines  <cit> . in this study no genotoxic or cell synchronizing agents were used. the pt <dig> aav super-permissive cell isolate offers us a unique reagent which might be useful in several ways. one use is to identify cellular genes that are needed for aav autonomous replication by comparing the pt <dig> transcriptome to cells which allow only low aav replication levels. the discovery of cellular helper and inhibitor genes for aav will likely be very useful for increasing production of recombinant aav virus for human gene therapy as well as for a better understanding of aav's life cycle.

an important part of the molecular biology of aav are the cellular proteins intimately involved in aav dna replication. in fact, a series of such proteins have already been identified to be directly involved in aav in vitro dna replication. these cellular components are replication protein a , replication factor c , proliferating cell nuclear antigen , and dna polymerase delta  <cit> . these proteins have also been shown to help minute virus of mice , an autonomous parvovirus  <cit> . to our knowledge only pt <dig> has been described as being super-permissive for aav replication. thus, to better characterize pt <dig>  in this study we analyzed the rna expression of these known replication proteins in pt <dig> cells compared to normal keratinocytes  and another primary cervical cancer isolate, pt <dig>  these latter two cell types allow only much lower levels of aav dna replication. it was found that all  <dig> of these cellular replication components are up-regulated in high aav-permissive pt <dig> versus low-permissive pt <dig> or nk.

RESULTS
aav <dig> replicates significantly higher in pt <dig> cells
aav has been isolated from sse of the anogenitals and autonomous parvoviruses preferentially replicate in malignant cells. thus, to test the hypothesis that aav preferentially replicates in cervical cancer cells we compared three primary cervical cancer isolates and two archival cervical cancer cell lines to normal primary human foreskin keratinocytes  for the ability to allow aav autonomous replication and virion production within the organotypic epithelial raft culture system. all of these cells, except the normal keratinocytes, contain human papillomavirus type  <dig>  dna. the nk cells represent a mixed culture of cells isolated from multiple individuals. the six types of cells were infected with aav, transferred into the raft culture system to form a stratified squamous epithelium, harvested on day  <dig>  dna extracted, and analyzed by southern blot. two types of analyses were done as depicted in figure 1a. first, aav dna replication was analyzed in the various squamous cell lines as sse rafts, as a "first plate" analysis. second, aav virion production was measured by generating putative aav virus stocks from equivalent "first plate" rafts and then a portion was used to infect a "second plate" of adenovirus-infected hek <dig> cells. any aav dna replication in the  <dig> cells would be due to aav virions produced in the first plate rafts.

the southern blot analysis of aav replication directly in the first plate rafts is shown in figure 1b. as can be seen, of the six cell types one isolate showed an unusually high level of aav replication compared to other isolates. pt <dig> allowed for approximately a  <dig> fold higher level of aav dna replication compared to all other cervical cancer cell lines by densitometric analysis. all the other cervical cancer lines, and normal keratinocytes, also demonstrated aav replication, but at a much low level. a quantification of the dna replication levels is shown in figure 1c. these results are comparable to a similar first plate raft experiment of aav dna replication shown in figure 1d. however, coupled with this experiment is a second plate analysis of aav virion production as shown figure 1e. note that pt <dig> was, in addition to higher aav dna levels, also demonstrated higher levels of virion production as well. thus, pt <dig> is super permissive for complete aav's full life cycle.

gene expression analysis with normalization to actb, gapdh, or hg-u133a housekeeping genes
as pt <dig> allowed much higher levels of aav replication we expected these cells to over express cellular components pcna, pold <dig>  rfc, rpa <dig>  and rpa  <cit> . thus the transcriptome of pt <dig>  representing the high aav replication scenerio, was compared to low/normal aav replication cell types pt <dig> and nk by dna microarray analysis. total rna prepared from pt <dig>  pt <dig> and nk was examined for the expression levels of affymetrix hg-u133a . the rna samples were isolated in-house and sent to the university of iowa dna core for analysis. three different methods for data normalization using actb, gapdh, and affymetrix u-133a housekeeping expression, respectively were utilized.

in data normalization methods using actb as a control housekeeping gene, all genes  we identified  <dig> probe sets that changed at least 2-fold between pt <dig> and non-pt <dig>  we also found  <dig> up-regulated probe sets in pt <dig> and  <dig> down-regulated probe sets that changed at least 2-fold in either pt <dig> or nk. a total of  <dig> probe sets pointed at differently expressed genes. seven genes, members of four critical cellular components identified as essential for aav dna replication  <cit> , were up-regulated in pt <dig> compared to pt <dig> and nk cells. these genes included pcna, pold <dig>  rfc <dig>  rfc <dig>  rfc <dig>  rpa <dig>  and rpa <dig> , when normalized to actb.

three difference methods for data normalization using actb, gapdh, and affymetrix u-133a housekeeping genes, respectively, were utilized.

normalization of all probe sets  to expression of gapdh as a control gene revealed  <dig> probe sets that were up-regulated, and  <dig> probe sets that were down-regulated, in pt <dig> compared to pt <dig> and nk cell lines, for a total of  <dig> genes of all differently expressed genes. yet again the same seven aav-critical genes were up-regulated in pt <dig> compared to pt <dig> and nk, , this time when normalized to gapdh. these data provide evidence that the cellular components reported to be involved in aav in vitro dna replication may also be involved in vivo aav dna replication as well. furthermore these data suggest a mechanistic explanation as to why pt <dig> allows high aav dna replication.

affymetrix u-133a housekeeping genes normalization, across all probe sets  on the array, revealed  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated transcripts in pt <dig> compared to pt <dig> and nk cell lines, for a total of  <dig> probe sets of all differently expressed genes. again six of seven of the same aav-critical genes were up-regulated in pt <dig> compared to pt <dig> and nk, , this time when normalized to a broad series of housekeeping genes. using this third control analysis, rpa <dig> dropped out due to lack of statistical significance. similar analyses were made for cellular helicases and dna polymerase α, which have been suggested to be involved in aav dna replication. as can be seen the data suggests that cellular helicases dhx <dig> and recql were up-regulated in pt <dig> compared to pt <dig> and nk, however dna2l was down-regulated . the data also suggests that cellular dna polymerase α was up-regulated in pt <dig> compared to pt <dig> and nk .

comparison of normalization techniques
based on the number of transcripts identified as differentially expressed, the three techniques used to normalize the array data could be ordered by the number of genes identified as differentially expressed as follows: gapdh  > actb  > u-133a . although the three array normalization methodologies differed in the number of genes defined as down- or up-regulated in expression in pt <dig> compared to pt <dig> and nk cell lines, all identified the same  <dig> up-regulated genes  except rpa <dig> in normalization using hg-u133a housekeeping genes . this finding suggested that these seven genes were clearly differentially over-expressed in pt <dig> versus pt <dig> and nk cell lines.

verification of microarray results by real-time quantitative pcr
as we did the microarray analysis using a single mrna isolation/cdna probe analysis, we needed to verify the transcriptional over-expression of these seven genes by real-time quantitative pcr. to determine the optimum amount of cdna template in initial experiments, we performed undiluted, 1: <dig> diluted, and 1: <dig> diluted cdna template in parallel. gene expression of nk, pt <dig> and pt <dig> cdna templates were normalized to the ct value of reference genes: gapdh or actb, respectively, to calculate the ct values of pcna, pold <dig>  rfc <dig>  rfc <dig>  rfc <dig>  rpa <dig>  and rpa <dig>  we used nk as calibrator . the rt-qpcr results confirmed the microarray results, that pcna, pold <dig>  rfc <dig>  rfc <dig>  rfc <dig>  rpa <dig>  and rpa <dig> were over-expressed in pt <dig> . the relative quantitative expression of the  <dig> genes between pt <dig> and non-pt <dig> samples was set at a significance level of  <dig> . to see the comparative gene expression levels of pcna, pold <dig>  rfc <dig>  rfc <dig>  rfc <dig>  rpa <dig>  and rpa <dig>  comparing the microarray and qpcr results, we used non-pt <dig>  cells as the calibrator .

super-permissiveness does not correlate with cytotoxicity
it has been reported in cnn in  <dig>  in work done by craig meyers, that aav preferentially kills cancer cells http://www.cnn.com/2005/health/06/22/cancer.virus/. this reported cancer cell killing may be related to parvovirus replication as certain parvoviruses have been reported to preferentially replicate in malignant cells  <cit> . thus we tested the high and low aav-permissive cells for their sensitivity to killing by aav infection. the results are shown in figure  <dig> and demonstrate that pt <dig> was not preferentially sensitive to killing by aav <dig> infection compared to other squamous cells.

discussion
earlier studies by ni et al and nash et al identified a number of cellular components which are required for in vitro aav dna replication using both adenovirus-infected and uninfected cell extracts  <cit> . these cellular components, found to be critical, include pcna, rfc, rpa and dna polymerase delta . this study demonstrates that the pt <dig> primary cervical cancer cell isolate, which is super-permissive for aav replication  <cit> , over-expresses all four of these components, when compared with pt1/nk. thus, the data presented here are fully consistent with the earlier in vitro studies, but now extend these studies into the context of the living cell. these data also further characterize the primary cervical cancer isolate pt <dig> and confirms the ability of aav to replicate in sse, now including malignant cells  <cit> . it is also confirmed that aav <dig> variably replicates in multiple cervical cancer isolates  <cit> . thus far, to our knowledge, only the pt <dig> isolate has been described as super-permissive for aav replication, this being when compared to a variety of cells of squamous origin.

both the affymetrix dna microarray data and real-time quantitative pcr results demonstrated that all four of these cellular components were over expressed in pt <dig> cells. pold <dig> and pcna were strongly over-expressed in pt <dig>  moreover, multiple rfc and rpa family members were over-expressed in pt <dig>  thus, these data support the unusual phenotype of pt <dig> cells and suggest their use as a unique reagent for identifying critical genes involved in aav replication. this phenotype also suggests the possibility that pt <dig>  itself, may be useful as a platform for raav production. one issue against this idea is that aav replication in pt <dig> takes place during cellular differentiation . during such differentiation cells of keratinocyte origin become highly keratinized and become physically very stable, somewhat similar to a ''piece of plastic''. this is problematic for the efficient isolation of raav from keratinized pt <dig> cells. however this possibility is worth investigating.

ni et al and nash et al  <cit>  identified pold <dig> as the central dna polymerase, which is a leading strand dna polymerase, the main mechanism through which aav dna replication takes place. the need of pcna and rfc is also compatible with pold <dig> as the main aav-polymerase as pcna is the processivity factor for pold <dig>  and rfc is known to assemble pcna onto 3'oh primers. rpa was not found essential when using adenovirus-infected cell extracts, in contrast to uninfected cell extracts  <cit> . in any case these data are also consistent with christensen and tattersall  <cit>  who found that these same four proteins  were the minimum cellular factors required for mvm dna rolling-circle replication when using a 3'-dimer junction. however their in vitro reactions also included mvm ns <dig> protein and cellular pif protein.

in the latest study by nash et al  <cit>  it was mentioned that there is one additional protein component  which was needed but was unidentified. it was further speculated that it was a cellular helicase. to approach this question we revisited the pt3vspt1/nk dna microarray data to observe if particular dna helicases or overall helicase activity was higher in pt <dig>  this approach seems valid as even though we have not done the usual triple-dna microarray analysis, the real-time quantitative pcr expression data fully confirmed the dna microarray results across multiple genes. thus, the affymetrix microarray data we have in hand appears worthy of study for gleaning suggestive information on the aav-permissive transcriptome. it was found, as shown in table  <dig>  that the overall helicase activity was not significantly different in pt <dig> cells, with two helicases being up-regulated and one down-regulated in pt <dig> versus nk/pt <dig> 

while pold <dig> was clearly found required for aav in vitro replication by nash et al  <cit>  there is a possibility the dna polymerase alpha might be involved in certain "alternative" forms of aav dna replication, such as through the use of internal origins of replication  <cit> . both sv <dig> and parvovirus h- <dig> are able to use polymerase alpha for replication  <cit> . to approach this question we revisited the pt3vspt1/nk dna microarray data to observe if dna polymerase alpha was higher in pt <dig>  the results of the affymetrix data are shown in table  <dig>  and suggest that dna polymerase alpha is also significantly up-regulated in pt <dig> over pt <dig> and nk. however, the importance of this up-regulation, if any, is not yet determined.

one question which arises from this data is how or if the four components are coordinately up-regulated in pt <dig> cells. as we are analyzing the rna expression of these genes transcriptional regulation is the most likely explanation and it is possible that a common transcription factor regulates them all. possible examples for such coordinated transcriptional regulation include transcription factors hdref, cfdd, p <dig>  and sp <dig>  among others. one anecdotal finding needs to be mentioned about the pt <dig> cell isolate, that being its high sensitivity to culture conditions. pt <dig> cell cultures, when grown side by side with pt <dig> and nk, would go into a period of en masse cell death if not fed in a timely fashion, or kept out of the incubator for too long. pt <dig> and nk cells were resistant to such die-offs under similar culture conditions. in any case, the isolation and characterization of the novel pt <dig> cell line gives us a unique reagent to investigate the optimal cellular transcriptome needed for aav <dig> replication. such knowledge will be useful for understanding aav molecular biology, for generating high yield raav virus for gene therapy, and for understanding aav's anti-cancer properties.

CONCLUSIONS
the novel cell line pt <dig> is super-permissive for aav dna replication and over-expresses dna polymerase δ, pcna, rfc and rpa. this is important as in vitro studies by ni et al and nash et al have identified these same cellular components as being involved in aav dna replication in vitro. our in vivo data and the in vitro data of others, together, strongly suggest that the pt <dig> cell line is a unique reagent which can be used to investigate the optimal cellular transcriptome which is needed for aav replication. the further "mining" of pt3vspt1/nk microarray data to intimate additional aav-relevant genes will ultimately give us better understanding of aav molecular biology, better understanding of aav's anti-cancer properties, and ultimately allow for higher yields in the production of raav virus for gene therapy.
