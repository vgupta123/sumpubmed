BACKGROUND
plant growth and development are regulated by signal transduction pathways that incorporate environmental stimuli and internal signals such as metabolic status. the absolute levels of soluble sugars, and/or the rate of flux of soluble sugars through certain metabolic pathways, are important indicators of metabolic status. recent studies have established the role of sugars in regulating, at least partially, a variety of developmental processes from seed development and germination, early seedling development, vegetative growth and senescence to abiotic stress response  <cit> .

genetic screens based on the phenomenon that early seedling development of wild-type arabidopsis can be arrested by high concentrations of exogenous sucrose  or glucose  have yielded sugar-response mutants. characterization of these mutants has revealed that many also have defects in phytohormone metabolism or response  <cit> . in particular, several of these sugar-response mutants are allelic to abscisic acid  biosynthesis or response mutants such as aba <dig>  aba <dig> or abi <dig>  the sugar-resistant mutants sis <dig>  <cit> , gin <dig>  <cit>  and isi <dig>  <cit>  are allelic to aba <dig>  an aba biosynthesis mutant  <cit> . the gin <dig> mutant  <cit>  is allelic to another aba deficient mutant, aba <dig>  <cit> . similarly, mutations in aba <dig> have been shown to confer glc insensitivity  <cit> . the sugar-resistant mutants sis <dig>  <cit> , gin <dig>  <cit> , isi <dig>  <cit>  and sun <dig>  <cit>  are allelic to abi <dig>  an aba-insensitive mutant  <cit> . the abi <dig> locus encodes an apetala <dig> type transcription factor  <cit> . mutations in abi <dig> have also been shown to confer a weak, but still significant, sugar-insensitive phenotype  <cit> . interestingly, plants carrying mutations in abi <dig> or abi <dig> have been found to exhibit a wild-type  <cit>  or near wild-type  <cit> , response to the inhibitory effects of high sugar concentrations on early seedling development. previous research has given a mixed report on the role of abi <dig> in sugar response. the abi3- <dig> mutant was found to exhibit an almost wild-type response to high levels of exogenous glc  <cit>  but was also reported to show a less pronounced but significant glc insensitive phenotype when compared to wild-type plants  <cit> . in addition, it has been observed that specific abi <dig> alleles show decreased sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of a combination of aba and glc on seedling development  <cit> . recently abi <dig> has been reported to play an important role in inhibition of seed germination  <cit>  and post-germinative growth  <cit>  by glc.

in screens of ethyl methane sulphonate - or t-dna mutagenized arabidopsis populations for mutants with increased tolerance to the inhibitory effects of high levels of exogenous sugars on early seedling development, three sugar insensitive  loci were identified. map-based cloning experiments resulted in the identification of these loci. the sis9- <dig> mutation was found to lie in aba <dig>  a gene previously shown to act in aba biosynthesis  <cit> , and was not further characterized. the sis <dig> mutations lie in the same gene as the previously identified nced3/sto <dig>  <cit>  mutants. the sis <dig> mutation lies in the same gene as the previously identified abi <dig> mutants  <cit> . nced3/sto <dig> encodes a 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase  <cit> . expression of sis7/nced3/sto <dig> has been suggested to be rate-limiting in the positive feedback regulation of aba biosynthesis by aba under stress conditions  <cit> . expression profiling experiments identified  <dig> genes as being differentially regulated in the sis7- <dig> mutant when compared to wild-type seeds upon treatment with  <dig> mm glc. abi <dig> encodes a b <dig> domain transcription factor  <cit> . the sugar- and aba-insensitivity of multiple abi <dig> mutant alleles show a strong positive correlation in our assays.

RESULTS
isolation of sugar-insensitive  mutants sis <dig> and sis10
most wild-type arabidopsis seeds sown on minimal media  <cit>  supplemented with high levels of suc or glc  germinate but the resulting seedlings fail to develop green expanded cotyledons and true leaves  <cit> . instead, the seedlings develop small, white or purple cotyledons. in contrast, low concentrations  of exogenous suc or glc do not exert this inhibitory effect on normal shoot development. in addition, most wild-type seeds can develop into seedlings with expanded cotyledons and true leaves on media containing high concentrations  of sorbitol, which acts as a non-metabolizable sugar analog in arabidopsis. this observation indicates that the inhibitory effects of high sugar levels on early seedling development are not solely due to osmotic stress  <cit> .

genetic screens based on the inhibitory effects of high sugar levels on early seedling development led to the discovery of a number of sugar resistant mutants  <cit> . in one such screen performed previously by our lab, approximately  <dig>  m <dig> seeds derived from an ems-mutagenized arabidopsis thaliana var. col population were screened to identify seedlings that are resistant to  <dig> mm suc. the mutants identified via this screen are also resistant to high concentrations of glc and so were designated sugar insensitive, or sis, mutants  <cit> . cloning and characterization of one of these mutants, the sis7- <dig> mutant, is described below. a similar mutant screen was conducted as part of the work reported here. this new mutant screen was conducted using a t-dna mutagenized arabidopsis thaliana var. col population. the  <dig> spbarn binary vector used to generate this population contains random arabidopsis cdnas driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter  <cit> . approximately  <dig>  seeds from ~ <dig>  independent arabidopsis thaliana var. col transgenic lines were screened on media containing  <dig> mm suc and ~ <dig>  seedlings that developed shoot systems with expanded cotyledons and true leaves were transferred to soil. this high rate of seedlings exhibiting an apparent sugar-resistant phenotype is due to the fact that some fraction  of wild-type seedlings are able to escape the developmental arrest caused by high concentrations of exogenous sugars  <cit> . therefore, it is necessary to screen seeds harvested from each putative mutant to identify the relatively small percentage that exhibit a heritable sis phenotype. towards this end, the  <dig>  seedlings were allowed to grow to maturity and seeds were harvested from each plant. re-screening of seeds from each of the  <dig>  putative mutants on media containing  <dig> mm suc revealed that  <dig> of the putative mutants exhibit a reproducible sis phenotype. characterization of these  <dig> mutants revealed that they appear to represent nine independent mutagenic events. the cloning and characterization of three of these new mutants, sis7- <dig>  sis7- <dig> and sis10- <dig>  as well as the sis7- <dig> mutant, is described below. the results of these studies indicate that the sis <dig> mutations lie in a gene previously shown to affect aba metabolism, whereas the sis <dig> mutations lie in abi <dig>  which acts in aba response  <cit> .

sis <dig> mutants exhibit a sugar-insensitive phenotype
a significantly higher percentage of sis <dig> than of wild-type seeds develop into seedlings with relatively normal shoot systems on media containing  <dig> mm suc or glc . on media containing  <dig> mm suc, more than 80% of all three sis <dig> mutants form expanded cotyledons and true leaves, whereas less than 6% of wild-type seedlings develop expanded cotyledons and true leaves. the mutants were also assayed for osmotic tolerance using media containing high concentrations of sorbitol. when assayed on equimolar  sorbitol supplemented with a low  amount of suc, differences are hard to detect between wild-type and mutant lines due to the fact that development of wild-type seedlings is not strongly affected at this concentration of sorbitol. in contrast, when assayed on media containing  <dig> mm sorbitol and  <dig> mm suc, all three mutant alleles confer significantly increased osmotic resistance. mannose  is a glc analogue that inhibits seed germination and early seedling development at millimolar concentrations via a mechanism that has been postulated to involve hexokinase  <cit> . therefore, the mutants were assayed for man sensitivity. none of the three sis <dig> mutant alleles tested cause a significant alteration in sensitivity to  <dig>  mm man compared to wild-type seedlings .

sis7- <dig> exhibits resistance to the inhibition of seed germination by aba and paclobutrazol
previous studies have shown that sis4/aba <dig> mutants are resistant to the inhibitory effects of paclobutrazol, an inhibitor of gibberellin biosynthesis, on seed germination. similarly, sis5/abi <dig> mutants are resistant to the inhibitory effects of both paclobutrazol and aba on seed germination  <cit> . to determine whether mutations in sis <dig> exert similar effects, the germination rates of sis7- <dig> seeds on media containing aba or paclobutrazol were determined. seeds carrying the sis7- <dig> mutation exhibit significantly faster germination rates than wild-type seeds on media containing  <dig> μm aba and slightly faster germination rates on  <dig> μm aba, but have wild-type germination rates on higher concentrations  of aba . germination rates of sis7- <dig> and wild-type seeds were also assayed on media containing several different concentrations of paclobutrazol. the spy <dig> seeds were included as a positive control as they have previously been shown to be resistant to paclobutrazol  <cit> . seeds carrying the sis7- <dig> mutation display enhanced germination rates compared to wild-type seeds on media containing high levels  of paclobutrazol .

cloning of sis <dig> and pharmacological complementation of the sis <dig> phenotype
a map-based cloning approach was used to identify the sis <dig> gene. the sis7- <dig> mutant, which is in the col background, was crossed to wild-type hi-o plants. f <dig> progeny of this cross were screened on media containing  <dig> mm suc. those seedlings that formed relatively normal shoot systems  were selected and used to form a mapping population of  <dig> plants. sslp and caps markers were used to localize sis <dig> to a  <dig> kb region between bac clones mln <dig> and mie <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  dna spanning the entire  <dig> kb region was isolated from sis7- <dig> by pcr and sequenced. analysis of this sequencing data reveals that sis7- <dig> carries a  <dig> bp deletion and a partial t-dna insertion in the exon region of at3g <dig>  no other mutations were found in the region shown by mapping to contain the sis7- <dig> mutation. another sis mutation was independently mapped to chromosome  <dig> between bacs mln <dig> and msj <dig>  the region which contains the at3g <dig> gene. sequencing of the putative sis <dig> gene from this mutant, now named sis7- <dig>  identified a point mutation in the exon region that changes amino acid codon  <dig> from gly to asp. sequencing of the putative sis <dig> gene from a third sis mutant revealed that this mutant, now named sis7- <dig>  contains a large deletion in the sis <dig> gene . the finding that three independent sis mutants all carry mutations in at3g <dig> provides convincing evidence that the mutations in this gene are responsible for the sis phenotype observed in these lines. at3g <dig> has previously been shown to encode 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase , a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of aba  <cit> . plants carrying a t-dna insertion in nced <dig> are drought sensitive  <cit> . an additional mutant of nced <dig>  named sto <dig>  was identified in a screen for salt-tolerant mutants. these sto <dig> mutants exhibit resistance to the inhibitory effects of hyperosmotic stress on seed germination, but not on post-germinative growth  <cit> . a third mutant carrying a t-dna insertion in nced <dig> has also been described  <cit> . the three mutant alleles identified in this study were accordingly re-designated sis7-1/nced3-4/sto1- <dig>  sis7-2/nced3-5/sto1- <dig> and sis7-3/nced3-6/sto1- <dig>  to determine whether sis <dig> mrna levels are altered in the sis <dig> mutants, sis <dig> transcript abundance was assayed by rt-pcr in wild-type plants and in all three sis <dig> mutants. sis <dig> transcript was not detected in sis7- <dig> or sis7- <dig>  whereas in sis7- <dig> sis <dig> transcript abundance is approximately the same as in wild-type plants .

consistent with other aba mutants, sis7-1/nced3-4/sto1- <dig> exhibits a wilty phenotype when subject to water deprivation . to determine if the sugar insensitivity of the sis7/nced3/sto <dig> mutants is affected by aba deficiency, pharmacological complementation of sis7/nced3/sto <dig> mutant seedlings was conducted as described  <cit> . early seedling development of col wild type, three sis <dig> mutant alleles, the aba deficient mutant aba2- <dig> and an aba insensitive mutant abi4- <dig> were not affected by  <dig> mm glc media. addition of a noninhibitory level of  <dig>  μm aba to the media containing  <dig> mm  glc restored glc sensitivity of sis7-1/nced3-4/sto1- <dig>  sis7-2/nced3-5/sto1- <dig> and sis7-3/nced3-6/sto1- <dig>  as well as of the aba deficient mutant aba2- <dig>  but not that of the aba insensitive mutant abi4- <dig> . these results indicate that the sis phenotype of all three sis <dig> mutant alleles is caused by aba deficiency.

glc regulation of aba biosynthesis gene expression in germinating seeds
previously it has been shown that 7% glc causes aba accumulation  in wild-type seedlings and that an increase in aba levels is required for glc-dependent developmental arrest  <cit> . the expression levels of the aba biosynthesis genes, aba <dig>  aba <dig>  aao <dig> and aba <dig> were found to be increased by  <dig> and 6% glc. in contrast, nced <dig> expression was not activated by glc  <cit> . however, as these studies were conducted using young seedlings, the mechanism of high glc-induced aba accumulation in germinating seeds remains unclear. furthermore, it has been shown that high concentrations of exogenous sugars inhibit early seedling development only during a narrow temporal window   <cit> . we therefore performed quantitative real-time pcr  analysis of aba biosynthesis gene expression in both sis <dig> and wild-type germinating seeds. in brief, two biologically independent batches of col wild-type, sis7- <dig> and sis7- <dig> seeds were sown on minimal media for  <dig> h and transferred to media supplemented with  <dig> mm glc or  <dig> mm sorbitol for  <dig> h under continuous light before harvest. the total time of treatment was within the temporal window during which exogenous sugars can arrest seedling development  <cit> . total rna was extracted for qrt-pcr analysis. as shown in figure  <dig>  aba <dig>  sis7/nced <dig>  aba <dig> and aba <dig> exhibit higher steady-state mrna levels in wild-type seeds germinating in the presence of  <dig> mm glc than in the presence of  <dig> mm sorbitol. in contrast, aao <dig> steady-state mrna levels are not significantly different in wild-type seeds germinating on glc than on sorbitol. glc induction of sis7/nced <dig>  as well as aba <dig>  aba <dig> and aba <dig>  is abolished in the sis7- <dig> and sis7- <dig> null mutants, suggesting a certain level of endogenous aba may be required for glc induction of aba biosynthesis gene expression in germinating seeds.

transcriptional profiling identifies mis-regulated genes in the sis7/nced3/sto <dig> mutant
to identify genes that are differentially expressed in sis7-1/nced3-4/sto1- <dig> versus wild type, arabidopsis affymetrix ath <dig> genechips were used for transcriptional profiling of germinating sis7-1/nced3-4/sto1- <dig> and wild-type seeds. col wild-type and sis7-1/nced3-4/sto1- <dig> seeds were sown on minimal media for  <dig> h and transferred to  <dig> mm glc or equimolar sorbitol  media for  <dig> h under continuous light to allow induction or repression of glc-responsive genes. at the end of this incubation period 0–4% of the seeds had germinated. the reason that seeds were collected after a total of  <dig> h is based on the observation that exogenous sugars inhibit seedling development during a narrow temporal window   <cit> . data analysis using the expressionist software package is as detailed in "materials and methods". to identify genes that are expressed at significantly different levels in sis7-1/nced3-4/sto1- <dig> versus wild-type germinating seeds grown in the presence of  <dig> mm glc, the results of three independent genechip experiments using mutant seeds were compared with the results of six independent biological replicates of wild-type samples. significant differences in expression values were defined as those where the average expression levels between mutant and wild-type seeds differ by at least two fold and have a student's t-test p value of less than  <dig> . using these cutoffs, the levels of  <dig> transcripts were found to be altered in sis7-1/nced3-4/sto1- <dig> versus wild-type seeds incubated in the presence of  <dig> mm glc . of these genes,  <dig> had higher mrna levels in the mutant than in the wild type, whereas  <dig> genes had lower mrna levels in the mutant.

functional categorization of these mis-regulated genes was performed using the gene ontology  annotations tool from tair  <cit>  and the results are presented in figure  <dig>  notably, a significant percentage of the mis-regulated genes are involved in response to abiotic or biotic stimulus and to stress . over-representation analysis  was also performed. ora is a useful tool for analyzing gene expression data obtained from microarray experiments as it can determine whether a set of genes is statistically over-represented among the total genes expressed on the microarray. an online version of the genemerge program  <cit>  was used for ora to identify whether particular biological processes or molecular functions, as defined by go annotations, are statistically enriched in the set of differentially expressed genes in the sis7- <dig> mutant compared to the wild type  <cit> . genes involved in response to stimulus  are significantly enriched  and genes involved in response to abiotic stimulus  are also significantly over-represented . both of these sets of genes include pin <dig>  pin <dig> and cyp83b <dig>  manual inspection of the data identified two other genes involved in auxin metabolism: cyp79b <dig> and at4g <dig>  thus, interestingly, genes involved in auxin biosynthesis and transport represent 6% of the genes expressed at altered levels in sis7- <dig> versus wild-type seeds grown on  <dig> mm glc, and so are significantly over-represented amongst these genes, as auxin-related genes comprise far less than 6% of the arabidopsis genome. cyp79b <dig> is involved in trp metabolism and converts trp to indole-3-acetaldoxime , a precursor to indole acetic acid   <cit> . expression of cyp79b <dig> is reduced more than five-fold in mutant seeds relative to wild-type seeds grown in the presence of  <dig> mm glc. at4g <dig> encodes an iaa-amido synthase that conjugates asp and other amino acids to auxin in vitro. an insertional mutation in this gene causes increased sensitivity to iaa in seedling roots  <cit> . cyp83b <dig> is required for red light signal transduction and auxin homeostasis  <cit> . pin <dig> and pin <dig> are auxin efflux transporters and regulate root development  <cit> . interplay between auxin and aba signaling to regulate lateral root development has been suggested by previous studies  <cit> . the decreased mrna levels of these auxin-related genes in glc-treated sis7-1/nced3-4/sto1- <dig> seeds provide further evidence of cross-talk between these pathways.

to determine which of the genes listed in table  <dig> are glucose regulated, the data from genechip experiments performed using seeds grown in the presence of  <dig> mm glc were compared with data from genechip experiments performed using seeds grown in the presence of equimolar sorbitol. based on these comparisons, the fold change in expression level  was determined for each of the genes listed in table  <dig> for both sis7- <dig> and wild-type seeds . based on their glucose-responsiveness in sis7- <dig> and wild type, these genes can be classified into three categories. the first category includes genes that show similar glucose induction or repression in both sis7- <dig> and wild type. for example, the photosynthesis-related genes encoding cab <dig> and rubisco activase are repressed by  <dig> mm glc in wild-type as well as in sis7- <dig> seeds . similarly, the expression of pin <dig> is glc-repressed in both sis7- <dig> and wild type . the second category represents the majority of the genes on the list, which are not significantly regulated by glc in either wild-type or sis7- <dig> seeds. the third category contains a few genes that are glc-regulated in sis7- <dig> but that exhibit little to no glc regulation in wild type. for example, at4g <dig> transcript levels are increased  <dig>  fold by  <dig> mm glc in sis7- <dig> seeds but only  <dig>  fold in wild-type seeds. similarly, the expression of cyp79b <dig> is repressed 2-fold by glc in sis7- <dig> seeds but only  <dig>  fold in wild-type seeds. at5g <dig> transcript levels are decreased approximately 2-fold by  <dig> mm glc in sis7- <dig> seeds but are unchanged by glc in wild-type seeds . the identification of this third category of genes, combined with the fact that sis7- <dig> seeds are aba-deficient  <cit> , suggests that the glc-responsiveness of the genes in the third category is affected by endogenous aba levels.

quantitative real-time rt-pcr validation of microarray data
to re-test the results obtained through microarray experiments, qrt-pcr analysis was performed on selected genes, with an emphasis placed on genes related to auxin transport and metabolism. two biologically independent batches of col wild-type, sis7- <dig> and sis7- <dig> seeds were sown on minimal media, incubated for  <dig> h and then transferred to  <dig> mm glc or  <dig> mm sorbitol media and incubated for an additional  <dig> h under continuous light before harvest. total rna was extracted for qrt-pcr analysis to monitor the relative expression levels of an array of genes, including pin <dig>  pin <dig>  cyp83b <dig>  cyp79b <dig> and at4g <dig> . on  <dig> mm sorbitol  media, the expression levels of these genes are similar in sis7- <dig>  sis7- <dig> and col wild type. in contrast, on  <dig> mm glc media, the transcript levels of each gene are lower in the sis7- <dig> and sis7- <dig> mutants than in the col wild type . these qrt-pcr results confirm the findings from microarray data that the steady-state mrna levels of genes involved in auxin transport and metabolism are lower in the sis <dig> mutants than in the wild type on  <dig> mm glc.

sis7- <dig> mutants exhibit increased lateral root systems
the decreased mrna levels of auxin-related genes observed in glc-treated sis7-1/nced3-4/sto1- <dig> seeds provide further evidence of cross-talk between these pathways. to test whether the osmotic regulation of lateral root development is altered in the sis <dig> mutants, wild-type and sis7-1/nced3-4/sto1- <dig> seeds were germinated and grown on sorbitol media. the sis7- <dig> seedlings exhibit increased lateral root systems on sorbitol, when compared to the wild-type plants . these observations are consistent with previous findings that aba2- <dig> and aba3- <dig> display increased root system size on mannitol  <cit> .

evidence for an expanded role for abi <dig> in sugar response through mapped-based cloning of sis10
the sis10- <dig> mutant was isolated during the same screen of a t-dna mutagenized population, described above, that was used to isolate the sis7- <dig> and sis7- <dig> mutants. the sis10- <dig> mutant has strong glc and suc insensitive phenotypes during early seedling development. a map-based approach was used to identify the sis <dig> gene. towards this end, sis10- <dig>  was crossed with a wild-type plant of the hi-o ecotype. f <dig> seeds from this cross were selected using arabidopsis media supplemented with  <dig> mm suc to identify seedlings with a sis mutant phenotype. an f <dig> population of  <dig> sis plants was then analyzed using sslp markers. the sis10- <dig> mutation was mapped to chromosome  <dig>  approximately  <dig>  cm above marker  <dig> on bac msd <dig>  examination of this region of the genome revealed that abi <dig>  is present in the region believed to contain the sis <dig> locus. sequencing of abi <dig> dna isolated from sis10- <dig> revealed that the sis10- <dig> mutation results in deletion of  <dig> nucleotides between base pairs  <dig> and  <dig> of the genomic dna  in the 6th exon of abi <dig>  accordingly, the sis10- <dig> mutant has been renamed abi3- <dig> 

previous work from several labs  <cit>  characterizing the abi3- <dig> mutant, which is in the landsberg erecta background, found only slight to no effect of this mutation on sugar response. therefore, the finding that the sis10- <dig> mutation, which causes a strong sis phenotype, lies in the abi <dig> gene was unexpected. to test whether the mutation in abi <dig> is truly the cause of the sis10- <dig> sugar insensitive phenotype, two additional abi <dig> mutant lines were obtained and characterized. salk_ <dig> carries a mutation, here designated as abi3- <dig>  consisting of a t-dna insertion in the first exon of the abi <dig> gene . salk_ <dig> carries a mutation, here designated as abi3- <dig>  consisting of a t-dna insertion in the abi <dig> promoter region  <cit> . sugar-insensitivity assays on plants homozygous for the sis10-1/abi3- <dig>  abi3- <dig> and abi3- <dig> mutations reveal that all three mutations confer significant resistance to the inhibitory effects of  <dig> mm suc on early seedling development, compared to wild-type plants . these results confirm that mutations in abi <dig> can lead to a strong sugar-insensitive phenotype.

previous work indicated that abi3- <dig> has a relatively strong aba insensitive seed germination phenotype  <cit> , but displays only a very subtle sugar insensitive phenotype during early seedling development  <cit> . the finding that other abi <dig> mutants, such as sis10-1/abi3- <dig>  abi3- <dig> and abi3- <dig>  can have strong sugar-insensitive phenotypes during early seedling development raised the possibility that different mutations in abi <dig> may predominantly affect either aba or sugar response. to test this hypothesis a careful analysis was conducted to determine the relative degrees of sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of aba on seed germination and of suc on early seedling development of nine different abi <dig> mutant lines . these nine abi <dig> lines included the sis10-1/abi3- <dig>  abi3- <dig> and abi3- <dig> mutants described above, as well as the abi3- <dig>  abi3- <dig>  abi3- <dig>  abi3- <dig>  abi3- <dig> and abi3- <dig> mutants  <cit> . all of these mutants are in the col ecotype. the molecular lesions of the different abi <dig> mutants are depicted in figure  <dig>  to measure sugar response, seeds of all nine abi <dig> mutants plus col wild-type were sown on minimal arabidopsis media  <cit>  supplemented with  <dig> or  <dig> mm suc and grown in continuous light for  <dig> d before scoring. these suc concentrations were chosen to allow detection of differences in the degree of suc insensitivity. the  <dig> mm suc concentration is sufficient to allow detection of mutants with relatively weak sugar-insensitive phenotypes, as these mutants will still exhibit a significantly greater ability than wild-type plants to develop expanded cotyledons and true leaves on  <dig> mm suc. however, a  <dig> mm concentration of suc may not be sufficient to distinguish between mutations that confer moderate versus strong sugar-insensitive phenotypes. this distinction can be made using the  <dig> mm suc concentration. selection on media supplemented with  <dig> mm suc revealed that five of the abi <dig> mutations  confer strong sugar-insensitive phenotypes. the other abi <dig> mutations tested conferred lesser degrees of sugar-insensitivity. the relative degree of sugar insensitivity of these other four mutants, from highest to lowest, is: abi3- <dig>  abi3- <dig>  abi3- <dig> and abi3- <dig> . to assess the relative effects of the different abi <dig> mutations on aba sensitivity, seed germination was assayed at different time points and in the presence of different concentrations of aba . a regression analysis of the results indicates a strong positive correlation between sugar insensitivity and aba insensitivity of tested abi mutants . in other words, mutations that confer a high degree of insensitivity to aba also confer a high degree of insensitivity to suc. conversely, mutations that confer only weak aba insensitivity also confer weak insensitivity to suc.

discussion
molecular genetic studies on arabidopsis sugar response mutants have revealed extensive evidence for cross-talk between sugar and phytohormone response pathways  <cit> . for example, exogenous glc has been proposed to slow the decrease in aba concentrations that occurs during seed germination  <cit> . glc has also been shown to help regulate expression of a number of genes involved in aba metabolism in seedlings. several aba biosynthetic genes, including aba <dig>  aao <dig> and aba <dig> are upregulated by  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm glc via a mechanism that requires that a certain endogenous aba level is maintained  <cit> . interestingly, these same genes are downregulated by  <dig> mm mannitol, via a mechanism that does not appear to require wild-type levels of endogenous aba. these results suggest that regulation of these three genes by glc is distinct from their regulation by osmotic stress. similarly to aba <dig>  aao <dig> and aba <dig>  the aba biosynthetic gene aba <dig> is also upregulated by  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm glc via a mechanism that requires that endogenous aba levels be maintained above a certain level. however, unlike aba <dig>  aao <dig> and aba <dig>  expression of aba <dig> is also upregulated by  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm mannitol via a mechanism that does require maintenance of endogenous aba levels  <cit> . so, although regulation of all four genes by glc appears similar, aba <dig> exhibits significant differences in expression in response to osmotic stress.

the aba biosynthetic gene sis7/nced3/sto <dig> also exhibits an expression pattern that is distinct from that of the other aba biosynthetic genes discussed above. in wild-type seedlings, the expression of sis7/nced3/sto <dig> is not activated by glc but is strongly induced by salt or osmotic stress  <cit> . in fact, sis7/nced3/sto <dig> may act primarily in the biosynthesis of aba during stress conditions  <cit> . due to these regulatory and functional differences, it was not clear whether mutations in sis7/nced3/sto <dig> would cause a sugar-insensitive phenotype, as had been previously shown for mutations in other aba biosynthetic genes  <cit> . results presented here, showing that the sis <dig> mutations lie in nced3/sto <dig>  demonstrate that mutations in sis7/nced3/sto <dig> do confer a strong sugar-insensitive phenotype.

expression of sis7/nced3/sto <dig> has been suggested to be rate-limiting in the positive feedback regulation of aba biosynthesis by aba under stress conditions  <cit> . transcriptional upregulation of sis7/nced3/sto <dig> by aba has been found in certain aba-deficient mutants and ecotypes  <cit> . however, the transcriptional regulation of nced <dig> as well as other aba biosynthesis genes by glc in germinating seeds is unclear. results presented here  show that in wild-type germinating seeds high concentrations of exogenous glc result in increased sis7/nced <dig> steady-state mrna levels. steady-state mrna levels of aba <dig>  aba <dig> and aba <dig> in wild-type germinating seeds are also upregulated by high concentrations of exogenous glc. in contrast, in germinating seeds of the sis7- <dig> and sis7- <dig> mutants, glc induction of aba <dig>  sis7/nced <dig>  aba <dig> and aba <dig> is abolished. previously it has been shown that  <dig> mm glc induces aba accumulation  in imbibed seeds  <cit> . the results of experiments presented here, analyzing glc regulation of aba biosynthesis genes in sis <dig> and wild-type germinating seeds, indicate that high glc levels activate aba biosynthesis by increasing the steady-state mrna levels of aba biosynthesis genes. these increases may, in turn, subsequently lead to aba accumulation.

besides transcriptional regulation, translational and post-translational mechanisms may also be involved in sugar-mediated regulation of aba levels and/or signaling in germinating seeds. for example, loss-of-function of the keep on going  gene, which is involved in abi <dig> degradation, causes the mutant seedlings to exhibit a sugar hypersensitive phenotype  <cit> . in wild-type germinating seeds, the glc-mediated increases in aba levels may induce sis7/nced <dig> expression, as well as the expression of other aba biosynthetic genes, thus resulting in sustained increases in aba levels  <cit> . in the sis7/nced3/sto <dig> mutant, this positive feedback control loop is likely broken as is evidenced by the loss of glc induction of aba <dig>  sis7/nced <dig>  aba <dig> and aba <dig> in sis7- <dig> and sis7- <dig> germinating seeds. thus the failure to accumulate aba under 'sugar stress' may render mutant seedlings unable to carry out a normal sugar response. consistent with this possibility are findings that the nced3/sto <dig> mutant accumulates only one-third as much aba as wild type under sorbitol stress  <cit> . in addition, it has been reported that aba levels in sto1/nced <dig> plants are somewhat lower than those found in unstressed wild-type plants  <cit> . these results may explain the enhanced germination rate of sis7- <dig> seeds on very low , but not on higher , levels of aba. also, addition of exogenous aba to the  <dig> mm glc media eliminated the sugar-insensitive phenotype of sis7/nced3/sto <dig> seedlings, indicating that the sis phenotype is caused by a deficiency in endogenous aba.

as some mutants that are resistant to glc and suc also exhibit resistance to man, the ability of the sis7- <dig> mutant to germinate on media containing  <dig>  mm and higher concentrations of man was tested. man inhibition of seed germination has been postulated to act through a hexokinase-dependent pathway. this hypothesis is based on the fact that the hexokinase inhibitor mannoheptulose can reverse the inhibitory effects of man on germination of wild-type seeds  <cit> . the results of experiments testing the ability of sis7- <dig> seeds to germinate in the presence of man indicate that sis7- <dig> does not exhibit increased resistance to the inhibitory effects of exogenous man on seed germination. this finding is consistent with the results of man seed germination assays conducted on other aba mutants, where aba1- <dig> and aba3- <dig> were found to be unable to germinate in the presence of man and aba2- <dig>  <cit>  and aba2- <dig> and aba2- <dig>  <cit>  were found to be only very slightly resistant to man. these results suggest that response to the inhibitory effects of man on seed germination may not require aba accumulation. in contrast, mutations in abi <dig> and abi <dig> cause reduced seed sensitivity to man  <cit> , indicating that defects in aba signaling components can affect man sensitivity. the molecular mechanism by which defects in some aba signaling components, but not defects in components of the aba biosynthetic pathway, affects inhibition of seed germination by man remains to be elucidated. further complicating analyses of the role of sis7/nced3/sto <dig> in seed germination and other processes are findings that sis7/nced3/sto <dig> belongs to a multigene family with nine members in arabidopsis, five of which are postulated to be involved in aba biosynthesis  <cit> .

transcriptional profiling analyses identified  <dig> genes with altered mrna levels in sis7- <dig> germinating seeds grown on  <dig> mm glc. functional categorization and over-representation analyses by go annotations revealed significant enrichment of genes involved in response to stimulus, particularly abiotic stimulus. an interesting finding from these analyses is the decreased steady-state mrna levels of auxin biosynthesis and transport genes in sis7- <dig> treated with glc when compared to the wild type. these findings were re-tested by qrt-pcr analyses. the results of the qrt-pcr experiments confirm that the steady-state mrna levels of these auxin-related genes are indeed lower in sis7- <dig> and sis7- <dig> germinating seeds compared to wild-type seeds . previous studies have suggested cross-talk between the aba and auxin response pathways in regulating arabidopsis root system development  <cit> . the sis7- <dig> mutant exhibits increased lateral root development on sorbitol media when compared to the wild type . in addition, atnced3::gus expression has been observed at lateral root initiation sites, suggesting control of lateral root development by both aba and auxin  <cit> . the findings reported here suggest that part of the molecular mechanism by which aba/auxin cross-talk occurs during regulation of root development may involve regulation of auxin biosynthesis and transport genes in response to aba levels.

to determine which of the genes listed in table  <dig> are glucose regulated, the results from genechip experiments performed using seeds grown in the presence of  <dig> mm glc were compared with data from genechip experiments performed using seeds grown in the presence of equimolar sorbitol . interestingly, a subset of the  <dig> genes listed in table  <dig> exhibit only slight or no obvious glc response in wild-type seeds, but exhibit significant glc regulation in sis7- <dig> seeds, which have decreased aba levels  <cit> . this result suggests that changes in endogenous aba levels modulate the expression of this subset of genes. modulation of glc response by aba at transcriptional or tissue levels has been demonstrated. rook et al.  have shown that aba does not activate apl <dig> expression alone, but greatly enhances apl <dig> induction by sugars  <cit> . glucose has been shown to delay arabidopsis seed germination  <cit> . dekkers et al.  have demonstrated that low aba concentrations combined with glc enhance the inhibitory effect of glc on seed germination  <cit> . together, these results indicate that glc-response may be modulated by aba levels.

different abscisic acid insensitive  mutants display different responses to high levels of exogenous glc and suc. previous studies showed that mutations in abi <dig> confer significant resistance to the inhibitory effects of high concentrations of exogenous glc or suc on early seedling development, whereas the abi1- <dig>  abi2- <dig>  abi3- <dig> and abi5- <dig> mutants exhibit only slight to no resistance to glc or suc  <cit> . interestingly, abi3- <dig> mutants, which lack one third of the abi <dig> gene and are thus believed to be null mutants  <cit> , have been shown to be resistant to the inhibitory effects of  <dig> mm glc on early seedling development  <cit> . however, quantitative data indicating the degree to which abi3- <dig> mutants are resistant to glc are lacking. therefore, the finding that the sis10- <dig> mutant, which has a strong sis phenotype, lies in the abi <dig> gene was unexpected. in addition, the findings reported here that sis10-1/abi3- <dig> has significant sis and abi phenotypes, whereas abi3- <dig> has been reported to have a significant abi phenotype  <cit>  but little to no sis phenotype  <cit> , suggested that it might be possible to separate genetically the role of abi <dig> in aba and sugar response. to test this hypothesis, quantitative assays were conducted to determine the sensitivities of nine different abi <dig> mutant lines, all in the col background, at two suc and two aba concentrations. the results of these experiments indicate that the degree of suc resistance shows a close, positive correlation with the degree of aba resistance. these results therefore do not provide evidence for a genetically separable role for abi <dig> in sugar and aba resistance, although such a possibility cannot be ruled out at this time. the previous findings that abi3- <dig> has only a very slight effect on sugar response may be at least partially explained by the fact that the abi3- <dig> mutation is in the landsberg erecta rather than the col background. the landsberg erecta ecotype exhibits a significantly greater level of sugar sensitivity than that of the col ecotype . a role for abi <dig> in both sugar and aba response is also consistent with results indicating that mutants carrying specific abi <dig> alleles exhibit increased resistance to glc in the presence of aba  <cit>  and that overexpression of abi <dig> confers hypersensitivity to glc  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper the map-based cloning and characterization of two genes that affect sugar response at the early seedling developmental stage are reported. these studies resulted in identification of new sis mutants which carry defects in the aba biosynthesis gene nced3/sto <dig> or the aba response gene abi <dig>  the sis7/nced3/sto <dig> gene is rate-limiting in the positive feedback regulation of aba biosynthesis by aba under stress conditions  <cit> . transcriptional upregulation of aba biosynthesis genes by  <dig> mm glc has been shown to occur in germinating wild-type seeds, but not in germinating sis7- <dig> or sis7- <dig> seeds. transcriptional profiling experiments resulted in identification of  <dig> transcripts with altered steady-state mrna levels in sis7- <dig> versus wild-type germinating seeds treated with  <dig> mm glc. over-representation analysis revealed that these  <dig> genes are significantly enriched for genes involved in response to abiotic stimulus. of particular interest are findings that auxin metabolism and transport genes are significantly over-represented in genes with lower transcript levels in the sis7-1/nced3-4/sto1- <dig> mutant. these results have been verified by qrt-pcr analyses. these findings suggest that part of the molecular mechanism by which aba and auxin interact during regulation of arabidopsis root development may involve regulation of auxin homeostasis and/or transport by aba levels. previous reports that abi3- <dig> has a significant abi phenotype but little to no sis phenotype, together with results presented here showing that sis10-1/abi3- <dig> has significant sis and abi phenotypes, suggested that it might be possible to separate genetically the role of abi <dig> in sugar and aba response. however, quantitative analyses of the magnitudes of the defects in suc and aba response of nine different abi <dig> mutants, all in the col background, show that the strengths of these two phenotypes exhibit a strong positive correlation. the relatively weak sis phenotype shown by the abi3- <dig> mutant may be due, at least in part, to the fact that it is in the landsberg erecta background, as different ecotypes have been shown to exhibit significantly different levels of endogenous sugar sensitivity .
