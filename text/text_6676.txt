BACKGROUND
integral membrane proteins participate in diverse cellular functions such as signal transductions, bioenergetics, ion transport, cell adhesion, and cell-cell recognition. it has also been estimated that about 20-30% of a typical genome encode for proteins with a transmembrane  domain  <cit> . despite their biological importance and abundance, the mechanism by which tm proteins fold into native structures remains poorly understood due to a limited number of solved structures, accounting for less than 1% of all deposited structures in the protein data bank   <cit> . therefore, computational methods play an important role in deciphering the sequence-to-structure relationships and advancing our knowledge in this particular class of proteins.

though recently solved structures of several amino-acid transporters, e.g., eukaryotic clc transporter  and potassium ion transporter  revealed the existence of short helices in the reentrant region  <cit> , the canonical topologies of tm proteins can be viewed as pairs of interacting transmembrane helices , connecting loops and extramembraneous domains. in particular, the interaction between tmhs is an important determinant of folding and stability by the proposed two-stage model  <cit> . such an interaction is mediated by structural contacts at the helical interfaces with the protein itself, the ligands, as well as the lipid environment. from the perspective of structural modeling, the rotational angle of a tmh is a strong determinant of its interacting faces with the rest of the protein structure and the lipids. at the stage of conformation space sampling, we could filter out decoys that severely deviate from the predicted rotational angles. to elucidate rotational angles, eisenberg et al.  <cit>  showed that hydrophobic scales can be used to estimate the hydrophobic moment direction to approximate the lipid-facing direction and proposed equations to calculate the rotational angles of tmhs based on such property. later, several hydrophobicity scales or propensities have been proposed  <cit>  to predict exposed residues or faces. to the best of our knowledge, there have been few advances to use lipid exposure, specifically the relative accessible surface area  in the lipid environment, to predict rotational angles. henceforth, we use rasa for convenience to represent rasa in the lipid environment since in this paper we focus on the residues in such environment.

to determine the rotational angle of each tmh in the tertiary structure of a tm protein requires the information of lipid-facing direction, which has been defined differently in the literature. pilpel et al.  <cit>  described the lipid-facing direction as the vector opposite to the bisector of the acute angle formed by the two lines from the geometric center of the target tmh pointing to the geometric centers of the two nearest tmhs in the whole molecule. stevens and arkin  <cit>  defined lipid-facing direction of a tmh as the vector connecting the geometric centers of the target helix and the whole molecule. the molecule could be a single chain or the complete protein. dastmalchi et al.  <cit>  accepted both the above definitions for lipid-facing direction.

lipid exposure of each tmh has been shown useful in distinguishing between surfaces and interior interfaces, identifying potential functional residues buried in the protein core and exposed residues for protein-protein interactions  <cit> , and therefore facilitates the prediction of helix-packing conformations  <cit> . in this work, we propose to use predicted rasa to estimate lipid-facing direction and then determine rotational angles of tmhs.

in order to train machine learning models by observed rasa from solved structures, we calculated the accessible surface area  by rolling a spherical probe along the van der waal’s  surface of a protein molecule  <cit> . the observed rasa for each residue is defined as dividing asa by its reference value in an extended gly-x-gly tripeptide conformation. several methods have been proposed to predict asa instead of rasa in the lipid environment. for example, asap  <cit>  uses evolutionary profiles to predict solvent accessibility by the support vector regression  and reports a pearson correlation coefficient  of  <dig>  for asa prediction. the mprap  <cit>  uses the support vector machine  to predict asa of complete tm proteins by evolutionary profiles and residue distance from membrane center  <cit> . a number of methods have been proposed to predict the burial or exposed status of each tm residue, where the status is determined by rasa whether below a predefined threshold. several methods predict the status of tm residues directly from sequences without predicting their asa; most of them rely on sequence conservation or knowledge-based propensities, including kprot  <cit> , propertm  <cit> , tmlip  <cit> , mo  <cit>  and tmx  <cit> . rhythm  <cit>  predicts the burial status of tm residues by matrix-based helix-helix contact prediction and sequence conservation, but this method requires prior knowledge of tmhs such as membrane coils or transporter/channels.

in this paper, we present tmexpo, a method to predict rotational angles of tmhs. for each tm residue, tmexpo first predicts rasa by svr and predicts the burial or exposed status by svm; both models use evolutionary profiles, sequence conservation, helix insertion energy and biochemical properties as features. next, tmexpo determines rotational angles of tmhs based on the predicted rasa. in rotational angle prediction, tmexpo outperformed predictors using hydrophobicity scales and propensities by at least  <dig> ˚ in terms of mean absolute angular error  on the independent test set of  <dig> protein chains. notably, the prediction results showed that rotational angles of tmhs could be better inferred by predicted rasa than by existing scales. we expect the rotational angle prediction could benefit the structure prediction, especially for free modeling of transmembrane protein structures due to its difficulty and the necessities of reducing the number of packing arrangements.

RESULTS
observed rasa can better infer the lipid-facing direction than hydrophobicity scales and lipid-facing propensities
the packing mechanism in which tm protein assembles in the lipids is not fully understood. one significant advance in this area is seen in the mechanism of the sec translocon which demonstrates how tm proteins enter the membrane  <cit> . a commonly accepted model of tm protein folding is the two-stage model  <cit> . later, white and colleagues extended the two-stage model by including a four-step thermodynamic cycle of folding energy description  <cit> . several scales and propensities were developed to understand the lipid-facing direction of tmhs based on sequence analysis or knowledge-based information; however, using these scales to predict the rotational angle of tm proteins often results in low prediction accuracy. therefore, we investigated whether an environment descriptor such as lipid exposure could better infer a geometric parameter such as the rotational angles of tmhs.

to gain insights into the relationship between lipid exposure and rotational angles, we analyzed a dataset of  <dig> multi-spanning protein chains with high-resolution structures, which were divided into a development set of  <dig> protein chains and an independent test set of  <dig> protein chains . we first used the naccess program  <cit>  to determine the observed rasa of each tm residue. we then calculated the rotational angle of each tmh by the rasa moment  derived from the observed rasa and compared it with the rotational angle calculated from existing hydrophobicity scales or propensities. the comparison results on the dataset in terms of maae are shown in table  <dig>  it can be observed from table  <dig> that the rotational angle calculated from the observed rasa achieves the best maae, outperforming the propensity-based methods by at least  <dig> ˚ on the development set and  <dig> ˚ on the independent test set. it demonstrates that the observed rasa could better infer the rotational angles of tmhs.

comparison of mean absolute angular errors  of rotational angles obtained by different methods on the development set and the independent test.

the success of determining the rotational angle via the observed rasa calculated by naccess may be due to the following two reasons. first, the description of observed rasa is derived from known protein structures, but the descriptions of hydrophobicity and lipid-facing propensities are derived from the sequence. therefore, hydrophobicity and lipid-facing propensities alone are insufficient for accurate inference of helical packing, thereby rendering worse rotational angle estimation. second, researchers had a simplified view of membrane proteins being “inside-out” proteins, which have interior polar core and exterior apolar surface  <cit> . however, this paradigm was challenged since biased distribution of hydrophobic residues could not be detected in every membrane protein  <cit> . as more solved structures become available, statistical analyses on these structures also support the above finding  <cit> . the canonical view of the “inside-out” property of membrane proteins based on hydrophobicity is challenged. on the contrary, observed rasa is a structural environment descriptor of helical packing and better infer the rotational angle.

relative accessible surface area predicted by tmexpo can also better infer the lipid-facing direction than hydrophobicity scales and lipid-facing propensities
to evaluate the capability of our proposed method for tm proteins with unknown structures, we used rasa predicted by tmexpo to determine the rotational angles of tmhs. then we evaluated how predicted rasa could infer the rotational angle in terms of maae by the following two experiments. first, we used the development set of  <dig> chains to develop the tmexpo prediction model and tested on the independent test set of  <dig> chains. second, we performed leave-one-out cross validation  on the development set. the results of both experiments are shown in table  <dig>  both rasa prediction results of the development set and the independent test set are provided in the additional file 1: dataset s <dig>  particularly, detailed prediction results of  <dig> tmhs in the independent test set are reported in the additional file 2: table s <dig>  notably,  <dig> of  <dig> tmhs had the angular error less than 15˚ and their rotational angles were predicted precisely by tmexpo.

observed from the first experiment, tmexpo-predicted rasa is shown to be comparable to the observed rasa derived from nacess for inferring the rational angles; the predicted rasa achieved an maae of  <dig> ˚, slightly worse than the maae of  <dig> ˚ achieved by the observed rasa. nevertheless, tmexpo-predicted rasa achieved much better maae than the other predictors using different hydrophobicity scales and propensities, including eisenberg et al.’s consensus hydrophobicity scale   <cit> , kprot  <cit> , propertm  <cit> , tmlip  <cit> , and mo  <cit>  by at least  <dig> ˚. the second experiment reported consistent results with the first experiment. specifically, performing loocv on the development set resulted in the maae of  <dig> ˚, slightly worse than that inferred by the observed rasa, but better than the compared predictors by at least  <dig> ˚. our results show that without known structures, tmexpo can effectively infer the rotational angle within a close margin to that inferred by the observed rasa and improve the prediction compared to hydrophobicity scales or lipid-facing propensities.

comparison of relative accessible surface area prediction methods
the proposed method tmexpo is capable of predicting not only the rotational angles of tmhs but also rasa of tm residues. we evaluated real-number rasa and binary classification of burial and exposed status predicted by tmexpo on the independent test set of  <dig> protein chains. at first, we demonstrated the performances of tmexpo in which tm residues participate in interchain contacts were excluded from the independent test set. the results are shown in table  <dig>  where exposed residues defined by observed rasa ≥5% are regarded as positive cases for evaluating the classification performance. tmexpo achieved an overall pcc of  <dig> , mean absolute error  of  <dig>  and root mean squared error  of  <dig>  in predicting rasa. with respect to the binary classification, tmexpo achieved an overall mcc, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision of  <dig> ,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively.

the boldface indicates the best performance among various methods.

next, we compared tmexpo’s performance of predicting rasa with existing methods, including tmx  <cit> , rhythm  <cit>  and mprap  <cit> . one distinction among these methods is that rhythm requires prior knowledge of protein types as membrane-coil or channel for prediction. for comparison, we retrieved the prediction results for tmx, rhythm and mprap from their web servers by using their default parameters. table  <dig> shows that tmexpo outperforms the compared methods across most of the measures except a slightly lower specificity compared to mprap by  <dig> %. the specificity of tmexpo is lower than its sensitivity by  <dig> %, and most of the predictors except mprap have the same trend as tmexpo’s results. this observation implies that the detection of buried residues may be more difficult than that of exposed residues in the tm domains. to further gain insights into this issue, we extracted buried residues in our dataset of  <dig> chains from the helix-packing database tmpad  <cit> , and found that over 77% residues have at least one interhelical contact. this suggests that prediction of buried residues could very likely be improved by detecting contacts of interhelical interactions; however, tmexpo and most of the compared predictors retrieve features by local information of subsequences only. interestingly, interhelical contacts may be conserved in sequences and discovered from evolutionary information such as pssm profiles  <cit> . we consider that evolutionary information is an effective feature for capturing interhelical interactions that contributes to rasa/burial status prediction; however, interhelical interaction prediction is still a challenging problem.

moreover, since we excluded tm residues that participate in interchain contacts, i.e., interface tm residues, in the training of tmexpo , we also compared the methods for classifying burial status of each interface tm residue in the independent test set. after removing tm residues with missing atoms, there are  <dig> interface tm residues out of the remained entire  <dig>  tm residues in the independent test set of  <dig> protein chains. since observed rasa derived from subunit structure and complete structure, respectively, can be different for interface tm residues, we used both the observed rasa to determine the “true” status of each residue. we reported the performance of each method based on the “true” observed rasa for both the  <dig> interface tm residues and the  <dig>  entire tm residues in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  respectively. the tables demonstrate that most rasa predictors, except mprap, have lower specificity than sensitivity. for the  <dig> interface tm residues, most predictors have better mcc calculated from complete structure than that calculated from subunit structure. furthermore, table  <dig> shows that tmexpo achieved slightly better mcc, sensitivity, and accuracy on the  <dig>  entire tm residues.

rotational angle can help in determining helical packing in transmembrane proteins
harrington and ben-tal  <cit>  characterized five structural features of interhelical interactions, namely, aromatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and two interactions from packing motifs, that are useful for helical packing. they proposed an algorithm to pack the tmhs of tm proteins, as follows: first, the algorithm ordered the tmhs by the sequence from the n-terminus, and then iteratively grouped sequential tmhs by a scoring function based on the five types of interactions. they demonstrated helical packing on  <dig> diverse proteins, and the average rmsd of cα in the native structure of the  <dig> reconstructed tm proteins ranged from  <dig>  Å to  <dig>  Å. in this subsection, we reexamined these proteins to study the rotational angle of tmhs and its relationship to helical packing. since the protein 1afo discussed in their work contains only one tmh, we excluded this protein in our analysis.

table  <dig> shows angular error of the  <dig> proteins. the maae of all  <dig> tmhs of the  <dig> proteins is  <dig> ˚, and 60% of all tmhs were predicted with maae ≤43˚. the worst maae  was found in protein 2oar, and the best case is 2uuh . out of all  <dig> tmhs,  <dig> tmhs were predicted with angular errors less than 10˚. with further investigation, we observed some common features from tmpad. first, most of tmhs are linear or curved, and three tmhs are slightly kinked in their structures. second, we observed strong interhelical interactions constrained in a single helical interface in most of these cases. for example, in the acid-sensing ion channel 2qts:a  <cit> , its tmh <dig>  shares  <dig> contact pairs with tmh <dig>  the second example is an avian mitochondrial complex ii   <cit> , where its tmh <dig>  shares  <dig> contact pairs with tmh <dig>  lastly, in the structure of aquaporin- <dig>   <cit> , its tmh <dig>  associates with tmh <dig> via a dense cluster of  <dig> contacts. based on the above findings, regular tmhs with strong and constrained interhelical interactions in a single helical interface reveal periodicity in rasa of their residues, thus making rotational angle prediction highly accurate.

the columns are protein chain, sequences of transmembrane helices, observed rotational angles from structures, predicted rotational angles by tmexpo, angular errors, and predicted rasa moment lengths .

on the other hand, since rotational angle prediction is strongly correlated with the periodicity of a helix, predicted rotational angles may not work well for packing of helices that deviate from regular periodicities of rasa, such as those severely kinked, disrupted, highly tilted, or associated with a reentrant loop. six out of all  <dig> tmhs were poorly predicted with angular errors over  <dig> ˚. we observed these six tmhs being classified as kinked or containing partial non-helical structure in the tm domain, and therefore the moment-based prediction performed poorly.

rotational angles prediction based on both predicted topology and predicted relative accessible surface area
to illustrate the capability of the proposed method for rotational angle prediction based on predicted topology information, we submitted sequences of independent test set to three web servers including svmsignal  <cit> , topcons  <cit>  and membrain  <cit> . as a pre-processing step, we removed predicted n-terminal signal peptide sequences by svmsignal. for all predicted tmhs, a correctly predicted tmh is defined as a one-to-one overlap with the observed tmh of pdbtm, and the minimum residue number of overlaps between predicted tmhs and observed tmhs of pdbtm is eight. within  <dig> tmhs of independent test set, the recall and precision of topcons is  <dig> %  and 100% , respectively. the recall and precision of membrain is  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively. for fair comparison in rotational angles, we only discuss  <dig> tmhs that have been predicted well by both of the two topology predictors. prediction results from svmsignal, topcons and membrain are available in the additional file 3: dataset s <dig> 

to obtain observed rotational angles corresponding to each predicted tmh, we removed atoms which were predicted outside the membrane by the topology prediction for each protein chain, and then we followed the definition in this work to calculate the rotational angles. specifically, we did not directly assign rotational angles calculated by tmh of pdbtm to predicted tmhs, but we recalculated rotational angles based on atoms of protein structure selected by predicted topology within the tm region. there are two reasons to do that. first, since the sequence of a predicted tmh is not identical to that defined by pdbtm and the definition of rotational angle depends on the helical principal axis and the cα vector of the first residue to its lipid-facing direction vector, we cannot simply assume their structural property is similar. second, for a predicted 3d protein structure, the tm region information comes from the topology predictor, and the rotational angle of each tmh is established on the atoms within predicted tm region, not from the pdbtm. therefore, we have to recalculate the rotational angles of predicted tmh for comparison. finally, we ignored any predicted tmh which includes residues that do not have structural data within pdb entity, and  <dig> tmhs were left for comparison.

the additional file 4: table s <dig> and the additional file 5: table s <dig> provide sequences of predicted tmhs corresponding to tmhs annotated in pdbtm, observed angle defined by residues of predicted topology, predicted angle, and moment lengths. for all  <dig> tmhs, the maae of topcons is  <dig> ˚ and maae of membrain is  <dig> ˚. these two tables demonstrate the ability of tmexpo to predict rotational angles based on predicted topology. interestingly, the maae of  <dig> tmhs based on topology predicted by topcons has better results than topology annotated in pdbtm. there are two possible explanations for this observation. first, tmhs predicted by topcons is longer than annotated in pdbtm, and this may help calculating the helical principle axis. second, we excluded tmhs that have partially incomplete structural data, and the performance of  <dig> tmhs would differ from the dataset of 188tmhs. we conclude that rotational angles calculated by both predicted tmhs and predicted rasa are still consistent with the observed rotational angles defined by the predicted tmh. therefore, while tmh boundary is not perfectly predicted, the predicted rotational angle can still provide useful information to the interior side of a tm protein and constrain decoys of predicted 3d structure.

an application to an amino acid antiporter, adic
we selected from our independent test set an amino acid antiporter, called adic, of e. coli strain o157:h <dig> to demonstrate how predicted rasa and rotational angle in the helical wheel presentation of tmhs facilitate the analysis of tm proteins. the e. coli strain o157:h <dig> is a pathogen and causes hemorrhagic diarrhea, and adic is a multi-spanning tm protein that enables e. coli to resist the acidic environment via exchanging extracellular arginine and intracellular agmatine  <cit> . an arginine-bounded structure of adic was solved and is coded as 3l1l  <cit>  in pdb.

the protein adic has  <dig> amino acids and contains  <dig> tmhs, including an inner layer containing  <dig> tmhs, i.e., transmembrane segments  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> from the n-terminus, and an outer layer containing  <dig> tmhs, i.e., transmembrane segments  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  figure  <dig> illustrates the top view of 3l1l, in which each residue in a tmh is shown by a color-coded gradient scale of its observed rasa, with dark red and dark blue representing extremely buried and extremely exposed, respectively. the red arrow inside each helical wheel indicates the lipid-facing direction, and the green clock-wise arrow starts at the first amino acid. a gray line connects two tmhs if they have interhelical interactions with more than five vdws as annotated in tmpad. it can be observed that most of residues in the five tmhs of the inner layer are colored as dark red, and the tmhs of the outer layer have residues in both exposed and buried sides colored by blue and red, respectively.

interestingly, several binding sites and functional mutagenesis were discovered in tmhs of the inner layer. according to annotations in the uniprot/swiss-prot, the amino acids  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are substrate binding sites located in the tmhs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the inner layer. furthermore, four reported mutations, y87a, y93a, y93k and y365a, related to transporter activity also occur in tmhs  <dig> and  <dig>  therefore, tmhs of the inner layer are important to transporter function study. all of the above six residues are classified as buried in the crystallized structure 3l1l, and their observed rasa range from 0% to  <dig> %. tmexpo predicted five of the above six residues as buried. only one residue 87y was predicted as marginally exposed and had  <dig> % rasa. figure  <dig> shows that the observed and predicted lipid-facing directions of the  <dig> tmhs are quite close. the maae of  <dig> tmhs is  <dig> ˚, and  <dig> out of  <dig> tmhs were accurately predicted with angular errors <30˚. the best angular error is  <dig> ˚ obtained by the linear tmh  <dig>  and the worst angular error is  <dig> ˚ obtained by the kinked tmh  <dig>  the pcc between the observed and predicted rasa of the entire  <dig> tm residues is  <dig> ; the mcc of the tmexpo’s classification of all the tm residues is  <dig> . our analysis shows that the predicted rasa of each residue could facilitate the design of site-directed mutagenesis experiments. therefore, sequence-based prediction of both rotational angle and rasa can provide useful information in transporter function study, and thus contribute to experimental design to elucidate tm protein functions when high-resolution structure is unavailable.

interhelical contacts play an important role in relative accessible surface area prediction
to understand how intrachain interhelical interactions affect the burial status of residues is important for helical packing and stability of tm proteins  <cit> . at first we observed residues carrying more intrachain interhelical contacts with other tmhs tend to be buried. we investigated on the tmhs of the development set of  <dig> protein chains whether buried residues are hard to predict their rasa values. using the annotations in tmpad, we separated residues into two sets according to different thresholds c of vdw contact numbers; one is called contact-enriched set of residues with at least c contacts, and the other set is called reference set consisting of the remaining residues. for each set, we calculated the pcc between the observed rasa and the predicted rasa obtained from loocv. the results are shown in table  <dig>  where different thresholds c =  <dig>  c =  <dig>  and c =  <dig> are considered. by comparing correlations of predicted rasa against observed rasa for different thresholds in loocv, we found that the set containing contact-enriched residues has lower correlation than the reference set by  <dig> % when c =  <dig> and by  <dig> % even when c =  <dig>  this observation implies rasa of residues that have a large number of interhelical contacts may be more difficult to be predicted, and then the information of interhelical contacts should be integrated for improving rasa prediction.

the first column stands for different thresholds, and the last two columns stand for pearson correlation coefficients of transmembrane residues from the two different sets.

CONCLUSIONS
sequence-based prediction of both rotational angle and rasa can provide indispensable information for structure prediction when high-resolution structures are unavailable and contribute to experimental design to elucidate tm protein functions. in this paper, we present a novel concept of using lipid exposure to infer rotational angles and have developed a machine learning approach to predict rotational angles of tmhs. significantly, using predicted rasa from our sequence-based model achieved an maae of  <dig> ˚ on the independent test set, which is better than that obtained by the best of the compared knowledge-based propensities . furthermore, we demonstrate an application for structural analysis via an amino acid antiporter. we believe improving prediction of rotational angle can benefit the structure prediction because free modeling of tm protein structures is a tough task and reducing the number of packing arrangements is necessary.
