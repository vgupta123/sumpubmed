BACKGROUND
contemporary systems biology have provided us with a large amount of data on topology of molecular networks, thereby giving us glimpses into computation and signaling in living cells. it have been found that 1) regulatory networks have broad out-degree distributions  <cit> , 2) transcriptional regulatory networks contains many feed forward motifs  <cit> , and 3) highly connected hubs are often found on the periphery of the network  <cit> . these findings are elements in understanding the topology of existing molecular networks as the result of an interplay between evolution and the processes they orchestrate in the cell.

in this paper we consider properties of proteins in the perspective of how they are positioned relative to each other in the network. this is in part motivated by the existence of highly connected proteins  and their relation to soft modularity  <cit>  in regulatory networks. in particular one may envision broad degree distributions and possible isolation of hubs as a reflection of a local "information horizon"  <cit>  with partial isolation between different biological processes. we here address this problem by considering the yeast regulatory network  <cit>  with regards to protein properties. using the gene ontology  consortium annotations <cit>  we will show that locality in the regulatory network primarily is associated to locality in biological process, and only weakly related to functional abilities of a protein.

RESULTS
more precisely, a go-graph is an acyclic directed graph which organize proteins according to a predefined categorization. a lower ranking protein in a go-graph share large scale properties with higher ranking proteins, but are more specialized. in the go-database, proteins are categorized into three networks according to different annotations, ranking known gene products after respectively: p) biological process, f) functional ability/design of the protein and c) cellular components where the protein is physically located. for each of these three ways of categorization we examined two distinct ways to measure go annotation difference .

in particular fig.  <dig> shows that proteins separated by one or two links are involved in similar processes. here distance l =  <dig> mostly count proteins on the periphery of a hub and their directly upstream and highly connected regulator. distance l =  <dig> count proteins regulated by the same highly connected regulator. note that we are averaging over all pairs in the whole regulatory network including connections to less well-connected regulators. in this way the highly connected nodes are counted for each of their downstream targets and therefore the larger hubs will make the dominant contributions to this calculation.

in all the panels in fig.  <dig> we also compare to a null model, generated by keeping the regulatory network, but randomly reassigning which proteins from the go-graph that are assigned to which positions on the network. this randomization maintain the positions of all nodes in the regulatory network exactly. by doing this randomization one loose any p, f or c correlation between a regulator and its downstream targets. any conceivable go-distance therefore becomes independent on the regulatory distance.

from fig.  <dig> we see that in order to reproduce the observed local correlations of go in a random sample of networks, these need to be generated with maximal bias. that is, the network generated with ε =  <dig> reproduce observed correlations between processes of proteins which are downstream of the same regulator i.e. at distance l =  <dig> in the regulatory network. at distances l >  <dig> there are no detectable correlations, which in turn is reproduced by allowing small imperfections  in the rewiring.

in fig.  <dig> we repeat the investigation from a), but with respect to the hierarchical go distance. in this case we see that ε ~  <dig>  →  <dig>  reproduce the observed correlations between protein processes out to larger regulatory distances . figure 3–, on the other hand, show that function or cellular localization are only moderately related within the same hub , and unrelated at all larger distances.

discussion
protein regulatory networks are highly functional information processing systems, evolved to perform a diverse sets of tasks in a close to optimal way. it is of no surprise that they are not random, also in ways that can be detected without knowing much about what actually goes on in the living system they regulate. however we do not, a priori, know much about the relative importance of function versus history: is the topology of a network primarily governed by the processes it direct, or is its topology influenced by random gene duplications  <cit>  and "link" rewirings  <cit> ?

concerning gene duplications  <cit> , we detected  <dig> paralogous pairs among the  <dig> gene products in ypd, see methods. of these  <dig> pairs, only ~15% significantly retained their common regulator, and only ~ <dig> % of the proteins pairs at distance l =  <dig> are detectable paralogs. therefore the contribution from duplication events to any go-similarity within hubs can be ignored.

our analysis in figs.  <dig>   <dig> emphasize the strong correlations between network localization and process, in particular very strong  correlation between process annotation of proteins in the same hub. in addition, we see some functional similarities between proteins in the same hub, in particular when considering the hierarchical go distances at l =  <dig> in fig.  <dig>  however we also find that the functional diversity within hubs are large in terms of the direct go distance ). combined fig.  <dig> therefore show that proteins in the same hub have quite large direct function-go distances, but rarely belong to entirely different function-go categories.

in any case we emphasize that we primarily find go-processes localized on hubs, and only weak correlations of the functional abilities between proteins involved in the same process.

the idea that process similarity are associated to network localization is not new, and implicitly behind attempts to infer gene networks from similarity in gene expression  <cit> . in the supplement we use gene expression from micro-arrays to re-investigate the correlation between process and locality in the regulatory network. thereby, we provide a broader support for our findings, and present a quantitative illustration of the extent to which gene-expression studies can be used to deduce co-regulation.

support for the ubiquity of the "one hub-one process" association is also found from the fact that the likelihood that a regulatory protein is essential is nearly independent on how many proteins it regulate  <cit> . that is, the question of whether a null mutant of a certain protein is viable is keyed to the essentiality of the regulated process, and not to whether the process needs many or few different "tools" to be performed.

CONCLUSIONS
overall we suggest that the topology of the yeast regulatory network is governed by processes located on hubs, each consisting of a number of tools in the form of proteins with quite different functional abilities. this is consistent with a network evolution where gene duplication occur, but where rewiring of regulatory links plays a bigger role  <cit> . the regulatory network is designed to co-regulate processes, and its evolutionary history must include a bias towards hub-regulation of individual processes. degree distributions are not broad because of duplication events, but because a given biological task sometimes needs many, but typically require few tools.

finally our analysis have consequences for development of null models for network topologies, and thereby for identifying functionally important network motifs  <cit> . while the previous null model  <cit>  maintain in- and out- degrees of each protein, it ignore correlations associated to cellular process. when nearby proteins are associated to the same processes one statistically expect an increased probability for cliques  <cit> . we therefore expect that some of the many feed-forward loops in transcription networks  <cit>  will be explained by a new type of null model: a null model where proteins contributing to a given process are forced to remain close in the randomized network.
