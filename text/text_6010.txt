BACKGROUND
phosphorus  is one of the three most essential macronutrients required by plants. it is well recognized as serving a wide range of structural and biological roles, such as energy metabolism, signal transduction, biosynthesis of macromolecules, modulation of respiration, photosynthesis and other metabolic processes  <cit> . the primary source for p uptake by plants is orthophosphate  in soil. due to the slow diffusion rate and chemical fixation, p is widely considered to be one of the most difficult nutrients for plants to forage, and often a major limiting factor to crop yields  <cit> .

the pi concentration in soil solution is commonly no more than 10 μm, whereas plant cells need to maintain their cytoplasmic pi concentrations at a millimolar range  <cit> , which determines the requirement of metabolic energy and specific transport systems for plants to acquire pi from soils  <cit> . in the past decades, aided by systematic studies of molecular biology and functional genomics of model plants, a great deal of knowledge about the mechanisms of pi transport by plants has been accumulated, revealing that the uptake and subsequently redistribution of pi within plants are mediated by a number of phosphate  transporters with different affinities that located in the plasma or organelle membranes  <cit> .

the first gene encoding plant pi transporter  was isolated from arabidopsis <cit>  and showed high sequence identity to the genes encoding high-affinity pi transporters in saccharomyces cerevisiae   <cit>  and in glomus versiforme   <cit> . the later studies further led to the isolation of other eight homologues exhibiting substantial identities to the atpt <dig> in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> , suggesting the expansion of pi transporter genes in higher plants during evolution. by now, with the completion of whole genome analysis of model plants, such as arabidopsis and rice, dozens of homologous genes encoding different affinities and groups of pi transporters have been identified in various plant species by comparative genomic approaches  <cit> . studies on the protein sequences and phylogenetic relatedness revealed that most of the pi transporters identified so far are typical of h+/pi symporters, and could be grouped into the high-affinity pht <dig> family included in the super facilitator superfamily   <cit> .

earlier studies on the regulation and tissue/cellular distribution indicated that members of the pht <dig> family in many species are divergent in function and differentially expressed during plant development or in response to different p status  <cit> . the relatively high levels of transcripts or proteins of some pht <dig> genes in roots, especially in root epidermis and root hairs, in response to pi deficiency well support a role of these genes in pi capture and uptake  <cit> . for example, in arabidopsis, eight of the nine pht <dig> genes were expressed in roots and two members, atpt <dig> and atpt <dig>  had the highest expression levels in response to pi deficiency. knock out of either of the two genes showed significant defects in p uptake under a low pi supply condition  <cit> . in some cases, the transcripts of some pht <dig> members are more widely distributed throughout plant tissues and showed less responses to pi deficiency, providing strong evidence to support that some of the pht <dig> members may be implicated in the internal mobilization of pi, such as loading or unloading from the xylem or phloem and deposition into seeds or other storage organs  <cit> . in addition to the pi-responsive pht <dig> genes, an increasing number of arbuscular mycorrhiza-induced pi transporters belonging to the pht <dig> family have been identified from several plant families, and their functions have been repeatedly documented to be associated with pi uptake at the intraradical symbiotic interface  <cit> .

tomato, a member of the solanaceae, is not only a world-wide major vegetable crop plant, but also a model plant for biological and genetic researches based on its relatively low-copy dna sequence and the nearly complete genome sequencing  <cit> . although previous studies have characterized the potential roles of a few individual pht <dig> members in tomato  <cit> , there is a lack of genome-wide analysis of the pht <dig> gene family in tomato and also in any other solanaceous species thus far. moreover, compared to the other model species, such as arabidopsis from brassicaceae and rice from gramineae, the evolutionary mechanisms, transcriptional regulation and possible functions of solanaceous pht <dig> genes in pi acquisition and mobilization still needs to be well explored  <cit> .

in the current work, we reported the genome-wide identification and comparative characterization of pht <dig> family genes in tomato and potato, and further investigated the expression patterns of tomato pht <dig> genes in response to am fungi inoculation under low- and high-p supply condition. the analysis in this study mainly focused on the chromosomal organization, phylogenetic evolution, tissue-specific expression and regulation of each member of the tomato pht <dig> family. the results obtained from this study would not only strengthen our understanding on the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolutionary expansion, conservation and functional divergence of the pht <dig> genes in tomato, but also provide valuable clues for the further comparative genomic studies across the whole solanaceae family.

RESULTS
identification of pht <dig> family genes in tomato
previously, five pht <dig> genes  encoding for putative high-affinity phosphate  transporters  in tomato have been reported  <cit> . in order to determine whether there are any further members, as yet unidentified, comprising the tomato pht <dig> family, the mrna and amino acid sequences of arabidopsis and rice pht <dig> genes were employed for blastn and tblastn searches against the recently released tomato genomic sequence database , which resulted in the identification of a total of eight non-allelic sequences as the putative tomato pht <dig> genes . blast searches of these sequences against the ncbi database demonstrated that five of the eight sequences were identical to the accessioned tomato pht <dig> genes, lept <dig> to  <dig>  the rest three putative genes , which were newly identified in this study, showed high levels of sequence identity to the known pht <dig> genes from tomato and other plant species . moreover, lept <dig>  which represents a distinct locus, harbors its coding sequence identical to that of the known lept <dig>  but with much difference in un-translated regions between the two homologues .

comparative analysis of the full-length deduced polypeptides revealed that the eight pht <dig> proteins contain 528- <dig> amino acids with  <dig> predicted transmembrane-spinning domains, similar to the molecular feature of pht <dig> transporters from other plant species. additionally, all the tomato pht <dig> amino acid sequences share the consensus sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase c and casein kinase ii and conserved residue for n-glycosylation . using the dnaman multiple sequence alignment program, the conserved domain, ggdyplsatixse, which have been suggested to be a typical signature of pht <dig> proteins, was also identified in all of these proteins . these findings led to the suggestion that all the identified genes could be considered as tomato pht <dig> genes.

a further blast searches against the tomato est database at ncbi, sgn and tigr database revealed that except lept <dig>  the other two newly identified pht <dig> genes, lept <dig> and lept <dig>  could matched perfectly to at least one significant est sequences, indicating that the two genes, like their previously reported five paralogues, are transcriptionally active in a certain tissues. it should also be emphasized that except the eight pht <dig> genes mentioned above, another sequence  identified in the tomato scaffold database searches also showed very high identity to the tomato lept <dig> and lept <dig> genes, but may be inactive due to the inclusion of some nonsense mutations and indels  within its putative coding region , as well as to the absence of any est sequence exactly matching.

identification of tomato pht <dig> homologues in potato and comparative analysis of these genes between the two solanaceous genomes
as a near complete set of potato genome sequences were also recently available at the sgn database  <cit> , for further investigating the evolutionary conservation and divergence of pht <dig> gene family between the two solanaceous species, the potato genome sequence database were extensively searched using the tomato pht <dig> genes as queries, leading to the identification of a total of  <dig> distinct genes as putative potato pht <dig> genes . sequence comparison of the potato pht <dig> genes revealed similar amino acid sizes and high sequence identities to their corresponding orthologues from tomato . it should be noted that there also exist two other sequences in the potato genome that showed substantial homology to the plant pht <dig> genes, but may be pseudogenes , due to the presence of some nonsense mutations and the inclusion of some indels  within their putative coding regions.

similar to the high sequence identity between the tomato and potato pht <dig> members, high conservation of chromosomal organization of the pht <dig> homologues from the two solanaceous species could also be observed. figure  <dig> shows the localizations of pht <dig> genes on the tomato and potato chromosomes. it was revealed that the distribution of the tomato and potato pht <dig> genes were obviously uneven, and concentrated on only three  chromosomes of the two plants. in addition, the supposed three pseudogenes  were restrictedly assigned on the chromosome  <dig> of the two plants. interestingly, except some individual members, such as lept <dig> on tomato chromosome  <dig> and stpt <dig> on potato chromosome  <dig>  most of the other pht <dig> genes/pseudogenes on the corresponding chromosomes were distributed in clusters with very short physical distance , suggesting that these clustered genes may be produced from independent tandem duplications during the evolution of solanaceae pht <dig> gene family.

in addition to the pht <dig> gene themselves, the potential genes surrounding each of the pht <dig> members were also carefully surveyed, resulting in the identification of several putative genes exhibiting substantial homology to plant pht <dig> and pht <dig> family genes on the corresponding chromosomes . by comparing the locations of these genes, such as lepht3; <dig> and stpht3; <dig>  we confirmed the existence of two segmental inversions associated with the long arms of tomato/potato chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  which resulted in the inverted linear order of the orthologous pairs of pt4/pt <dig> and pt1/pt <dig> on the corresponding chromosomal regions between the two species .

phylogenetic analysis of pht <dig> gene family in tomato and other plant species
in order to perform a comprehensive analysis of evolutionary relationships among pht <dig> genes between tomato and other plant species, including the eight pht <dig> proteins of tomato, a total of  <dig> plant pht <dig> protein sequences, representing  <dig> species from four plant families, gramineae, brassicaceae, leguminosae and solanaceae, were aligned and used to construct an unrooted phylogenetic tree. as shown in figure  <dig>  except atpt <dig> from arabidopsis and hvpt <dig>  ospt <dig> and zmpt <dig> from each of the three graminaceous species, barley, rice and maize, the other plant pht <dig> proteins in the neighbour-joining tree were well clustered into four distinct groups, consisting of one dicot-specific group , one monocot-specific group  and two mixed groups  with members from both dicots and monocots.

the group i harbors the proteins exclusively from the dicotyledonous species, in which they are subgrouped by phylogeny, and could be further classified into three subgroups . in addition, except the subgroup c, which only includes one member from each of the three species, arabidopsis, medicago and lotus japonicus, both of the other two subgroups, a and b, contain multiple pht <dig> members from the three plant families, leguminosae, brassicaceae and solanaceae. for tomato, six of the eight pht <dig> transporters  fall into two of the three subgroups. within subgroup a, the two tomato members, lept <dig> and lept <dig>  group together with their orthologous pairs from potato, eggplant and tobacco, to the exclusion of other two paralogues, lept <dig> and lept <dig>  which group together with other three potato homologues and forms a cluster with two soybean homologues, gmpt <dig> and gmpt <dig>  within the dicot subgroup b, the two tomato paralogues, lept <dig> and lept <dig>  group closely, and cluster together with three potato homologues, stpt <dig>  stpt <dig> and stpt <dig>  the grouping of lept <dig> and lept <dig> was expected as the two paralogues contain identical coding sequences. the rest two paralogues, lept <dig> and lept <dig>  were found to be assigned only into group iii, although the group iv also contains the members from both dicots and monocots. within group iii, the two genes, like their two paralogues lept <dig> and lept <dig> in group i, also group together with other solanaceous orthologues by forming an independent solanaceae clade consisting of two subclasses. both of the subclasses contain the orthologous pairs of pt <dig> or pt <dig> from tomato, potato eggplant and tobacco, suggesting that the duplication events associated with the arising of pt <dig> and pt <dig>  as well as pt <dig> and pt <dig> in tomato and other solanaceous species, occurred before the speciation of solanaceae lineages. additionally, most of the pht <dig> proteins in the group iii, including the pt <dig> and pt <dig> orthologous pairs, have been experimentally evidenced to be strongly induced in the roots colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal  fungi  <cit> . moreover, pht <dig> members from arabidopsis, of which the roots are unable to form am symbiosis, are all absent from group iii. interestingly, although the group iv contains much fewer members as compared with the other three groups, there exist two members from each of three species, arabidopsis, rice and soybean, but no homologues from any of the solanaceous species in the group iv, suggesting that the corresponding orthologues from solanaceous lineages have lost after solanaceae separation with brassicaceae and leguminosae.

expression analysis of the tomato pht <dig> genes in different tissues under low-p condition
in this study, for gaining better understanding of the possible functions of specific pht <dig> gene in tomato, the tissue-specific expression patterns of each tomato pht <dig> gene were examined in various tissues, including roots, stems, young leaves, flowers, as well as fruits at young and ripe stages using real-time rt-pcr. the quantitative data showed that except lept <dig> and lept <dig>  of which the transcripts were not detectable in all tissues examined, the transcripts of other pht <dig> paralogues were all detectable in a certain tissues and showed distinct but partially overlapping expression profiles .

lept <dig> was expressed in all tissues examined, and its transcripts were detected abundantly in roots and leaves, and to a lesser extent in stems and flowers, as well as in fruits. the transcripts of lept <dig> in green fruits were four times more than those in ripe fruits. in contrast to the ubiquitous expression profiles of lept <dig>  the expression of lept <dig> showed relatively distinct tissue-specific profiles, with its transcripts intensively in roots and extremely faintly in some of other tissues, such as in green and ripe fruits. the expression patterns of the lept <dig> and lept <dig> were a little similar, as both of the two genes were expressed very weakly in all tissues. even so, the highest transcript level for lept <dig> was detected in ripe fruits, and was about ten times more than that in green fruits. lept <dig>  the closest fellow of lept <dig> in phylogeny, was also dominantly expressed in roots, but with only one-third of the expression level of lept <dig> in the root tissues. additionally, very weak transcript levels of this gene were also detectable in stems and leaves. lept <dig> was also ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, and had a very similar expression tendency, but significant lower expression levels in all tissues as compared to its paralogue, lept <dig> . the differential but overlapping expression of the pht <dig> genes well mirrors the evolutionary conservation and functional divergence of pht <dig> transporters in tomato plants.

expression analysis of tomato pht <dig> genes in response to amf colonization under low and high pi supply conditions
since the expression of some pht <dig> genes in tomato and also in other plant species, have been characterized to be am-inducible and pi-responsive  <cit> , the relative expression levels of each tomato pht <dig> member were thus further determined in roots and leaves in response to am fungi  colonization under low  and high  pi supply condition. as shown in figure  <dig>  colonization of am fungi increased not only the biomass, but also the p concentration of the tomato plants under the low pi supply condition; however, no significant difference of both the biomass and p concentration could be observed between the colonized and the noncolonized plants under the high pi supply condition.

qrt-pcr analysis revealed that except the three paralogues, lept <dig>  lept <dig> and lept <dig>  of which the transcripts were strongly enhanced or specifically activated only in the inoculated roots under the low pi supply condition, and lept <dig>  of which the transcripts were not detectable in both tissues under any treatments, the expression of the other four paralogues, lept <dig>  lept <dig>  lept <dig> and lept <dig>  were significantly repressed under the high pi supply condition . such down-regulated cases occurred more conspicuously upon the two paralogues, lept <dig> and lept <dig>  as their transcripts in both the root and leaf tissues were drastically decreased  or even completely absent  under high pi conditions regardless of with or without am colonization. in addition, very significant decrease of the transcript abundance of the four paralogues was also detected in both the roots and leaves of the colonized tomato plants as compared to those non-colonized controls under low pi supply condition . the remarkable down regulation of these four members in response to high-p supply and amf-colonization might be partially caused by the significant increase of p concentration in such treated tomato plants . interestingly, although lept <dig> and lept <dig> were considered to be the closest related genes in tomato pht <dig> family due to their identical coding sequence, the down regulation of lept <dig> in roots in response to am symbiosis under low pi condition was much moderate than that of lept <dig>  such discrepancy in expression levels strongly suggests that the regulatory components controlling the activation or suppression of lept <dig> and lept <dig> have divergent after the two paralogues produced from a relatively recent duplication event.

the specialized expression profiles of the tomato pht <dig> genes in response to am symbiosis or different pi status prompted us to investigate their promoter regions. as shown in figure 7a, the number and localization of the two pi-regulated   <cit>  and one am-responsive elements   <cit>  differ widely in the promoter regions of these eight pht <dig> genes, even though the coding sequence and expression profiles of some paralogues are highly conserved. however, similar as the am-induced pht <dig> genes in other dicot species, the mycs motif was found to be present exclusively in the putative promoter regions of the three am-activated pht <dig> paralogues, lept <dig>  lept <dig> and lept <dig>  and were located very closely to the pi-regulated p1bs element  <cit> . histochemical staining analysis further revealed that the lept <dig> and lept <dig> promoter regions  containing the two elements, mycs and p1bs, were sufficient to direct β-glucuronidase  expression specifically in the mycorrhizal roots and were limited to distinct cells harboring am fungal structures  , similar to the cellular distributions of their paralogue lept <dig> and other am-inducible pht <dig> homologues from various other plant species reported previously  <cit> .

discussion
in recent studies, benefiting from the availability of whole genome sequence of model plants, dozens of genes belonging to the pht <dig> family that encode putative high-affinity pi transporters have been identified from various plant species using the comparative genome approaches. tomato, a model species from the solanaceae family, has been historically characterized to have at least five pht <dig> genes  <cit> . our present study, through extensive searches of available databases, led to the identification of a total of eight putative pht <dig> genes in the tomato genome. as this is the first genome-wide analysis of the pht <dig> gene family in any solanaceous species, the investigation of chromosomal organization, evolutionary relationships, as well as expression patterns of the tomato pht <dig> genes in this study is of great significance and would offer a basis for better understanding the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the expansion, conservation and functional divergence of the pht <dig> genes in the whole solanaceae family.

evolutionary expansion of the tomato pht <dig> genes
multigene families, in a general way, could arise through tandem duplications, resulting in a clustered occurrence, or through genome/segmental duplications, resulting in a discrete distribution of family members  <cit> . as most of the tomato pht <dig> genes were assigned in clusters , with not only very close physical localization , but also very high levels of sequence identity , it is strongly suggestive of that tandem duplications might be the major contributors to the expansion of the tomato pht <dig> family. additionally, since most of the tomato pht <dig> members group together with their orthologues from other solanaceous species, such as potato, eggplant and tobacco by forming independent solanaceous clades to the exclusion of other dicot homologues , indicates that the duplications associated with the arising of the coupled paralogues such as pt1/pt <dig> and pt4/pt <dig> in solanaceous species, occurred before the speciation of solanaceous lineages from a common ancestor. intriguingly, in viewing of the localization of tomato lept2/ <dig> and potato stpt2/6/ <dig> on their corresponding chromosomes, it is tempting to make a tendentious conclusion that the duplication giving rise of the tomato lept <dig> and lept <dig> probably occurred before the split of tomato and potato. however, the distribution of the lept <dig> and lept <dig> in the terminal subclades of the phylogenetic tree, and the identical coding sequence shared by them well reflected that the two paralogues were produced from the more recent duplication events that occurred within the tomato lineage postdating it split from a common ancestor shared by potato.

it has been recently documented that the solanum lineage genome has undergone two rounds of consecutive whole-genome triplication events, one that was ancient and shared with most dicot plant families, and one that was more recent and occurred before the divergence of tomato and potato lineages  <cit> , which led to the hypothesis that segmental duplications produced by genome polyploidy may also exert important impact on the expansion of the pht <dig> family. the loci of lept2/ <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and lept4/ <dig> on chromosome  <dig> flanked respectively by two paralogues, lepht3; <dig> and lepht3; <dig>   strongly suggests that the arising of the two pairs, pt2/pt <dig> and pt4/pt <dig> might originate from a segmental duplication, followed by two independent tandom duplications, which eventually resulted in the fixation of the two couples of pht <dig> members on the chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  as the pt <dig> and pt <dig> paralogues cluster together with other members from both dicots and monocots in the phylogenetic tree , indicating that the segmental duplication yielding the precursors of the two couples, pt2/pt <dig> and pt4/pt <dig>  occurred before the divergence of monocots and dicots. with regard to the other four paralogues, the clustered lept <dig> and lept <dig>  and the individual lept <dig> and lept <dig>  they may be the result of several relatively recent segmental or single-gene duplication events that occurred before the speciation of tomato and potato lineages, and followed by at least one independent tandom duplication event . it has been well documented that genome polyploidizations are commonly accompanied by massive chromosomal rearrangements  <cit> . in our study, by comparing the phylogenetic tree and the chromosomal distribution of the tomato and potato pht <dig> genes, two segmental inversions leading to the inconsistent linear orders of pt1/pt <dig> and pt4/pt <dig> were identified between the two solanaceous genomes, well supporting the very recent findings that at least nine large and several smaller inversions exist between the tomato and potato lineages  <cit> .

functional conservation and divergence of the tomato pht <dig> gene family
it has been generally accepted that gene duplication followed by functional differentiation has performed a pivotal role in driving evolutionary novelty that allow plants to increase fitness to new environments  <cit> . to data, as the lack of genome-wide survey of pht <dig> genes in any solanaceous species, there is no systematic analysis of tissue-specific expression patterns for the tomato pht <dig> family so far. in our present work, we revealed that differential but partial overlapping expression of the pht <dig> genes occurred in tomato, as did the members of this family in several other plant species, such as arabidopsis, rice and soybean  <cit> . the specialized expression of these genes well mirrors the evolutionary divergence of regulatory elements that are required for controlling pi uptake and mobilization within/across particular tissues or cells during tomato plant growth.

earlier results, based on the study of tissue-specific expression and cellular distribution of pht <dig> genes in several different plant families revealed that many of the pht <dig> genes are expressed dominantly in roots, especially in root epidermis and root hairs, in response to p deprivation, suggesting a potential role of these genes in pi capture and uptake  <cit> . the transcription data obtained in this study indeed provide direct evidence for strong expression of most of the tomato pht <dig> genes in the roots under low pi supply condition . it was shown that although the transcripts of lept <dig> in the roots and leaves significantly decreased in response to pi sufficiency, a low level of constitutive expression could be detected throughout the plant, consistent with the expression patterns of its orthologue, stpt <dig>  in potato  <cit> , suggesting that lept <dig> and its orthologues may be involved in not only uptake of pi from soil solution but also redistribution of pi within plants. lept <dig> has been previously documented to be expressed exclusively in p-depleted roots. however, in the present work, a relatively weak but still observable transcription level could be detected in the roots irrigated with high pi  solution, similar results could also be observed from our previous studies on the lept <dig> orthologues in other three solanaceous species, eggplant, pepper and tobacco  <cit> . in addition, very slight levels of the lept <dig> transcripts were also detectable in stems, flowers and fruits at green and ripe stages under low pi supply condition. although lept <dig> shares its coding sequence identical to its paralogue, lept <dig>  the transcript abundance of the two members were observably different whether under low pi supply condition or in response to am symbiosis. such discrepancy between the two close paralogues may be caused by the inconsistent distributions of pi-responsive elements, such as p1bs and w-box, in their promoters   <cit> . even so, the identical protein activity and high degree of overlapping expression strongly implies the presence of functional redundancy between the two members.

with regard to the three am-activated pht <dig> paralogues, lept <dig>  lept <dig> and lept <dig>  as their transcripts could be induced abundantly only in the inoculated roots under low pi, but not high pi condition, similar as the expression of their orthologues from tobacco, pepper, and eggplant, suggesting that the am-activated expression of lept3- <dig>  like their solanaceous orthologues, might also be regulated by at least two conserved cis-elements, p1bs and mycs  <cit> . comparative screening of the putative promoter regions of the tomato pht <dig> genes indeed led to the identification of the two motifs that were closely and exclusively localized in the promoters of the three am-activated pht <dig> genes . the relatively high proportion of am-induced pht <dig> genes present/retain in solanaceous species compared to that in many of other mycorrhizal plants, such as rice, to a certain extent, reflects the importance of these genes in regulation of symbiosis during the solanaceae evolution. in addition, the strong expression levels of these symbiosis-activated pht <dig> genes in contrast to the remarkable down-regulation of the pi transporters responsible for direct pi uptake in mycorrhizal roots also provided strong evidence to support the earlier findings that symbiotic uptake pathway would contribute the majority of the accumulated pi received by mycorrhizal tomato and other plants  <cit> . it is worth noting that although lept <dig> was observed to be the gene that had the highest expression level than the other paralogues in tomato mycorrhizal roots under low pi condition , mutation of the lept <dig> expression in tomato virtually unaffected the establishment of am symbiosis  <cit> , which seems contradictory to the recent findings that knock down/out of the am-specific or up-regulated pht <dig> genes in lotus japonicus, medicago and astragalus sinicus significantly impaired both the development of am interaction and symbiotic pi uptake  <cit> . the absence of am-associated phenotypes in the tomato lept <dig> knock out mutant was thus suggested to be the genetic redundancy within the tomato pht <dig> gene family  <cit> . this explanation might be reasonable as a result of that lept <dig> and its am-induced paralogue, lept <dig>  were considered to be diverged from a common precursor through tandom duplications , and thus it is unsurprising that lept <dig> would share a similar physiological role with lept <dig> in tomato. interestingly, although there exist two am-specific pht <dig> genes, the strongly activated ospt <dig> and poorly induced ospt <dig>  in the rice pht <dig> family, no functional redundancy was observed between the two paralogues, as silencing whichever of the two paralogues caused a significant repression of am symbiosis  <cit> . since the rice ospt <dig> and ospt <dig> are distributed relatively distantly in phylogenetic tree, similar as the phylogenetic relationships between solanaceous pt <dig> and pt4/pt <dig> paralogues, it is tempting to raise a speculation that no functional redundancy might be existent between the two groups  of pht <dig> transporters in regulation of the development of am symbiosis.

interestingly, within some other plant species, such as in soybean, there exists specialized pht <dig> member that is  mainly expressed in sink tissues, such as in flowers, implying possible functions of these genes in pi import from source to sink  <cit> . however, in our present study, we did not observe any member in the tomato pht <dig> family that is dominantly expressed in the flower or fruit tissue. the relatively high transcription levels of lept <dig> and lept <dig> in these sink tissues compared to the other six paralogues led to the suggestion that the two members, especially the lept <dig>  might have been evolved to meet the requirement of transporting pi from the source to the sink organs or cells. one of the potential evolutionary fates of gene duplications is considered to silence  one of the duplicate copies  <cit> . the inactivation of lept <dig> in all the tissues led to the suggestion that lept <dig> might be on the way to become a pseudogene. the presence of several fragments that showed substantial homology to plant pht <dig> genes but with incomplete coding regions in the tomato and potato genomes also well supports the theory that genome polyploidizations as well as the following gene loss  are common characters of plant genomes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, this study provided the first comprehensive analysis of the chromosomal organization, phylogenetic evolution and tissue-specific expression patterns for each member of the pht <dig> family in tomato. the results presented here could offer a useful basis for future research work on better understanding the mechanisms underlying the evolutionary regulation of pht <dig> genes in response to pi deficiency and am symbiosis during tomato growth. the high conservation not only in the coding sequence, but also in the chromosomal distribution between the tomato and potato pht <dig> orthologues could also lend strong evidence to support the further comparative genomics analysis across the whole solanaceae family. however, we also realize that although pht <dig> family have been commonly considered to be a high-affinity pi transporter family, an increasing number of members of this family in other plant species have been demonstrated exhibiting a low or even dual affinity for pi uptake in heterologous yeast or oocyte expression system  <cit> . therefore, more information, especially the transport kinetics, cellular distributions and physiological phenotypes of knockout/knockdown mutants is needed in the near future to determine more precise functional roles for each of the tomato pht <dig> genes.
