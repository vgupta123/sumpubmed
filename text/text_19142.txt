BACKGROUND
it is well known that chromatin, a complex of dna and proteins, is packed in three-dimensional  space inside the nucleus of the cell in a highly regulated fashion. the spatial conformation of chromosomes is governed by certain principles . the structure of chromatin depends on the functional state of the cell  and gene activity among other cellular properties. thus, a better understanding of 3d chromatin structure and the underlying mechanisms determining this structure helps in gaining an enhanced comprehension of many genomic functions. with the advent of chromosome conformation capture -based technologies in the last decade, starting with 3c itself in  <dig>  chromosome conformation capture-on-chip and circular chromosome conformation capture , and 3c-carbon copy  in  <dig>  chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing ,  <dig> , more recently hi-c  <cit>  and in situ high-resolution hi-c  <cit>  which is still quite expensive, genome-wide analysis of the interaction profiles is now possible  <cit> . studies have revealed a correlation between long-range chromatin interactions and the functional state of the cell, e.g., in  <cit>  and more generally, cell-type specificity as evidenced by  <cit> . these long-range interactions comprise pairs of loci that are close in space, but not necessarily close in sequence. the spatial co-localization of different chromosomal regions  can be due to a mix of factors, for example specific, direct contacts between two loci, nonspecific binding as a result of the packing of the chromatin fibre or co-localization due to functional association or having the same subnuclear structure  <cit> .

any long-range interaction  can typically occur to bring about or increase the likelihood of a certain activity at either of these loci itself  or so that they can trigger or play an important role in any activity  taking place at these loci or in their neighborhood on the genome. knowledge of which loci interact over a long-range and evaluating the effect of such interactions can help us further our understanding of genome regulation and organization. thus, it is of general interest to be able to predict whether a given pair of loci lying very far apart on the chromosome would interact. there exist machine learning-based approaches for predicting such long-range interactions between enhancer and promoter regions, for example,  <cit> . they combine the contact information output by a chromatin interaction experiment with various information sources, for example, epigenetic information  <cit> , to make these predictions, but these approaches leave out genomic regions for which such information is not available. a sequence-level model, in addition to primarily furthering our understanding of chromatin interactions at the most basic level, can also be useful to study any genomic region including the ones omitted by other approaches. having a model that can predict, based on sequence information alone, whether two regions are likely to interact has several potential applications. one is to use the predicted label as additional information for the prediction of boundaries of topologically associating domains   <cit> . another is to assist methods that predict the 3d structure of the chromosome from hi-c data  <cit> .

as a word of caution, since the genetic sequence is only the primary level at which genomic function and organization information is encoded, it is apparent that higher levels of modifications will have the final say towards these chromatin interactions, more so for cell line-specificity. in other words, one would not expect a model using sequence information alone to outshine one that  utilizes additional information sources in terms of prediction accuracy. but, a sequence-level model has its advantages as already stated. thus, we would like to stress upon our aim in performing this study: 
 answer the question: to what extent can the genetic sequence alone predict these long-range chromosomal interactions? we report on various computational experiments, using our genetic-sequence based prediction method, to establish that the dna sequence is informative to identify potential interaction partners of a given genomic locus, and

 understand the characteristic sequence features underlying such long-range interactions. this is achieved with the help of our two new visualization methods that aid in interpreting the sequence signals that contributed towards predicting locus-specific interaction partners and reveal interesting biological connections.




in general, we believe that such an approach using sequence-level information could be useful to study sequence peculiarities among the interaction partners of a particular locus. our approach could augment existing methods for prediction of 3d chromatin structure and also tad boundary predictions methods.

approach
in this study we built a method based on support vector machines   <cit>  to predict which genomic loci potentially interact with a given locus based on the genetic sequence. in a nutshell, we do the following: given a contact matrix delineating interactions between various genomic loci, we build a predictor for a locus of interest  from the contact matrix. this predictor learns the characteristics of the genomic loci that happen to significantly interact with the loi as against the set of loci that do not. thus, we build a predictor per locus. such locus-specific predictors that use the genetic sequence information at these loci have the potential to uncover peculiarities of the interacting partners of this particular locus which can be useful to understand interactions at the sequence level. such an understanding can guide us in our efforts to know the role-players at the genetic level and comprehend mechanisms of higher levels of chromatin organization viz. tads and their hierarchies, and compartments. when dealing with contact matrices output from a chromatin interaction experiment where a large population of non-synchronized cells are studied, such an approach can still give us a holistic view.

we analyzed 5c contact matrices for three human cell lines — gm <dig>  k <dig> and hela-s <dig> — and demonstrated that the genetic sequence is predictive of the long-range interactions. additionally, we utilized these locus-specific models, that were trained on the 5c data, to independently predict potential interaction partners across the chromosome for the same loi. this computational validation is done on high-resolution hi-c datasets from rao et al.  <cit> . our new visualization methods help to intuitively visualize the sequence features that proved useful for discerning the interaction partners of a loi from those that do not interact with it, consequently rendering our models to be more than black boxes. due to the models being locus-specific, one is also able to compare the sequence features found useful by a model  for a locus in one cell line to those found useful by the model for the same locus in another cell line. this is discussed in “identifying cell-line specific characteristic signals among interactors of the same locus in different cell lines” section.

RESULTS
applicable to information on long-range contacts facilitated by a 4c, 5c or a hi-c experiment, we describe our pipeline and the corresponding computational experiments performed on data from a 5c experiment  <cit>  that detects interactions between a group of transcription start site -containing regions  and distal enhancers in the three cell lines gm <dig>  k <dig> and hela-s <dig>  here, for each cell line, we built a separate classifier per tcr. given the set of loci, for which the contact frequency with the tcr of interest  is known , we trained an svm  <cit>  which, when presented with a new, unseen locus, can classify it as positive or negative . we use string kernels, which provide a measure of similarity between sequences, in conjunction with the svm. the aim was to build a pipeline with the best possible locus-specific classifiers , and also be able to determine subsequently, which sequence features were most important for any classifier to distinguish between the positive and the negative set of genomic loci corresponding to the loi. our pipeline is shown in fig.  <dig> and described in the “methodical details” section.
fig.  <dig> pipeline for predicting locus-specific long-range chromatin interactions using the genetic sequence. in the contact matrix, cells denoted by filled orange boxes correspond to loci that are called significantly interacting with the loi in all replicates of any experiment profiling chromatin interactions. this constitutes the positive set of sequences for the corresponding classifier. those denoted by filled black boxes correspond to loci that are not called significantly interacting in any of the replicates. this constitutes the negative set of sequences for the corresponding classifier. this leaves those loci which are called significantly interacting in at least one, but not in all of the replicates. they are visualized by unfilled boxes and are not used by the classifier. the genomic loci along the columns of the contact matrix  are the loi for which we build locus-specific classifiers




prediction of long-range chromatin interactions is possible from the sequence alone using non-linear svms
to evaluate the potential of the dna sequence to serve as the sole information source in predicting the long-range interactions, we selected ten regions per cell line. for each cell line, these are the top  <dig> regions when ranked based on the number of positive examples available for them . in each model, the varied-length sequences were represented as fixed-length feature vectors using the oligomer distance histograms   <cit>  representation. this represents any sequence by the histograms of distances between k-mers in the sequence . we performed experiments with k-mer values  <dig> and  <dig> and the maximum distance between k-mers as  <dig>  intuitively, k-mer value  <dig> encodes more specificity towards the set of sequences in a collection for a model while k-mer value  <dig> maintains relative generality. once these are fixed, the odh kernel has no other hyper-parameters to be tuned.

for any interaction the complete length of the fragment may not be causal for the interaction, but only part of it. however, this information is not available from the chromatin interaction experiments due to the length distribution of the fragments. our locus-specific models are able to work around this situation and capture the features from different parts of the locus. this is due to the nature of odh feature representations which capture the relative structure spread across the sequence rather than occurrences at different absolute positions in the sequence. section “tandem repeat motifs are an important feature distinguishing interaction partners” discusses how our visualizations help bring out this aspect of our models.

tandem repeat motifs are an important feature distinguishing interaction partners
figures  <dig> and  <dig> show our new visualizations of the set of k-mer pairs that influenced the prediction most. in both these visualizations, any k-mer pair is represented as an adjoined { 2k}-mer separated by ‘ |’, e.g., 3-mer pairs as 6-mers, and we loosely address these k-mer pairs as ‘motifs’, although they are not contiguous. figure  <dig> shows the ‘absolute max per distance’  visualization for a region  in cell line gm <dig>  the ampd visualization shows, at each distance value , the k-mer pair that contributes the most in predicting a locus as positive and negative. the weights of these k-mer pairs  are plotted on the horizontal axis. in the visualization, the k-mer pairs at even and odd distance values are segregated from each other to improve legibility. in the left panel, one sees 6-mers consisting of the 3-mer pairs separated by ‘ |’ , and in the right panel are 10-mers consisting of the 5-mer pairs. owing to the high dimensionality of the 5-mer case, we observe that the magnitudes of the weights quickly shrink in this case. we filter this information further and visualize only the top few high-scoring features in the ‘topn’ visualization shown in fig.  <dig>  at any distance value, all motifs that exceeded the threshold  are collected along with their weight magnitudes and stacked one over the other to finally represent them with a consensus motif . these consensus motifs are visualized radially.

across various regions, among many motifs, tandem repeat sequences are prominently observed, especially di- and trinucleotide repeats, at various distances. our ‘ampd’ visualizations facilitate spotting of patterns spread over distances while the ‘topn’ visualizations, due to the consensus motifs, can help spot possibly hidden shorter k-mer signals. refer to fig.  <dig> for the following discussion. the dinucleotide pattern ‘gt’ being repeated is observed in both cases, 3-mers and 5-mers, for distances up to  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, to have a maximal contribution among the various k-mer pairs towards predicting a locus as a potential interacting partner of locus chr21:34819525- <dig>  in gm <dig>  the 3-mer case shows patterns prominently containing more ‘t’s, from distance ∼30- <dig> as compared to the smaller distance values, among negatively contributing pairs, while the maximal positive contributors are devoid of them. various such patterns are observed for different regions across cell lines.

our literature search revealed some relevant studies on tandem repeat sequences and their potential biological roles. a  <dig> review by vogt  <cit>  provides a very comprehensive and extensive account of the potential functions of tandem repeat sequences in the human genome  <cit> . among many other things, it includes an exhaustive discussion of the various repeat sequences, viz. mono-, di-, tri-, tetranucleotides and beyond, and the postulates of their association with a multitude of nuclear proteins that help them assume specific chromosomal structures. the author terms this ability of the tandem sequence repeat blocks to render locus-specific higher order structure and play a role in organization as the ‘chromatin folding code’  <cit> . in the review  <cit> , the author also points to a specific case of the dinucleotide ‘tg’ as a simple repeating block, which has already been shown to have an enhancer function in vitro  <cit>  in as early as  <dig>  more recently, a  <dig> study  <cit>  identified dinucleotide repeat motifs  as general features that can render a nonfunctional sequence into an active enhancer element. another comprehensive study of the simple sequence repeats in  <dig>  <cit>  suggests their potential role in genome regulation and organization. variable number tandem repeats , as these sequence repeats are broadly termed, have already been implicated in many complex neurological disorders  and are generally known to be polymorphic  <cit> .

with this backdrop, it is interesting that, enabled by the visualizations, our models using sequence-level information also reveal such tandem repeat motif signals  as distinguishing characteristics between potential locus-specific interaction partners, suggesting a potentially important role of such sequence repeats in genome organization and regulation.

identifying cell-line specific characteristic signals among interactors of the same locus in different cell lines
as discussed in “prediction of long-range chromatin interactions is possible from the sequence alone using non-linear svms” section, an advantage of studying locus-specific interactions at the sequence-level is realized when our models can reveal the characteristic signals among interaction partners of the same locus in two different cell lines. consider the locus chr22:32170492- <dig> which is, both, region  <dig> and region  <dig> among our models for hela-s <dig> and k <dig> respectively . refer to their ‘ampd’ visualizations with 3-mers in fig.  <dig>  for k <dig>  the ‘ca’ dinucleotide repeat sequence stretch of length ∼ <dig> markedly denotes a non-interacting partner while this same repeat sequence seems to be interrupted with a short stretch of ‘t’s in hela-s <dig>  also, another repeat sequence, ‘aga’, is notable beyond distance values  <dig> among the non-interacting partners for this locus in k <dig> as compared to hela-s <dig> where it is only intermittently observed. these signals are, similarly, also picked up by our 5-mer models. the 3-mer and 5-mer ‘ampd’ visualizations for region  <dig> in cell line k <dig> and region  <dig> in hela-s <dig> are given in supplementary figures s <dig> and s <dig> respectively in additional file  <dig>  the corresponding ‘top25’ visualizations for these regions are given in supplementary figures s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> in additional file  <dig>

multitask learning  helps mitigate issue of having too few interacting partners per locus
each locus-specific prediction problem in our scenario is termed as a task in the mtl setting. the small sample sizes in the single-task setting can be mitigated with the help of the so-called ‘multitask’ setting . in order to evaluate the efficacy of mtl for this problem, we used the available  <dig> individual tasks. here, to compute the task similarity, we used the ‘model-defining’ locus  information. the locus sequence of every ‘model-defining’ region was represented as an odh feature vector using the k-mer values  <dig> and  <dig>  separately, and maximum distance  <dig>  the similarities between these regions, the tasks, were given by the resulting dot products. for models that used oligomer length  <dig> and  <dig> representations for the sample sequences, we used the corresponding task similarities also with oligomer length  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. the mean test auc values for the multitask setting with  <dig> tasks are shown in columns marked ‘c’ and ‘d’  of table  <dig>  mean performance increase across all regions: oligomer length 3: {gm <dig>  k <dig>  hela-s3}: { <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> }; oligomer length 5: {gm <dig>  k <dig>  hela-s3}: { <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> }. their box plots are shown in fig.  <dig> and supplementary figures s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> . performances in the mtl setting mostly show reduced variance as compared to the single-task performances.

thus, our pipeline in the mtl setting can  mitigate the issue of having either too few interacting partners per locus, or  in the extreme case, identify putative interaction partners of a locus not profiled in the 5c experiment provided that at least some regions from the same cell line have been profiled in a chromatin interaction experiment, for example, 4c or 5c.

computational validation with high-resolution hi-c
rao et al. performed hi-c experiments resulting in contact matrices at very high-resolution e.g. 1k, 5k, 10k, 25k base pairs , etc. for various cell lines including gm <dig>  k <dig>  <cit> . corresponding to the ‘model-defining’ regions, we picked relevant columns from the 5k hi-c cis-contact matrix of the relevant chromosome. for example, if the ‘model-defining’ genomic region was  <dig>  bps long, we collected candidate regions  corresponding to three column loci. the candidate regions are those which have a non-zero kr-normalized  <cit>  interaction frequency with the loi. after normalizing, to identify significantly interacting partners at any given resolution, we computed their observed/expected  values and used an ad-hoc cutoff of  <dig>  , as used earlier in  <cit> . this criterion is made more stringent as follows. the final set of loci that are considered significantly interacting with any individual ‘model-defining’ region are only those that are significant at 5k resolution and also at 10k or 25k resolutions . in other words, if a locus was deemed significant only at 5k resolution but not at  <dig> or 25k, then we did not consider it a true positive.

these cis-interacting genomic loci from the high-resolution contact maps are treated as unseen test sequences for the classifiers built for each region using the 5c data. in the pipeline, these are thus treated similarly to the 20% hold-out set: their odh feature representations are fed to the classifier to predict their labels. we performed this experiment for cell lines gm <dig> and k <dig> 

when evaluating performances of our models regarding predictions on unseen loci from hi-c data, we did so for two scenarios:  all chromosome-wide loci together; and  considering only loci lying beyond 1m bps from the ‘model-defining’ locus, i.e., excluding the regions probed in the 5c experiment  <cit>  for the evaluation. using this stringent criterion, the mean auc values and their standard deviations are as follows. for prediction with oligomer length  <dig> models  chromosome-wide interaction partners: {gm <dig>  k562} : {  <dig> ± <dig> ,  <dig> ± <dig> };  interaction partners beyond 1m bps: {  <dig> ± <dig> ,  <dig> ± <dig> }. and, with oligomer length  <dig> models  chromosome-wide interaction partners: {gm <dig>  k562} : {  <dig> ± <dig> ,  <dig> ± <dig> };  interaction partners beyond 1m bps: {  <dig> ± <dig> ,  <dig> ± <dig> }. for both cell lines, when considering only the first five regions, the average performance was ∼ <dig>  test auc . models for k <dig> show higher variance than models for gm <dig> 





we observed that performances of models predicting interaction partners for some loi are comparatively poorer than those of other models. these ‘model-defining’ loi either have very few negative samples to learn from  or are themselves rather long loci ’ in supplementary table s <dig> in additional file 1). in general, from the perspective of training on 5c data and predicting contacts chromosome-wide, the issues of having few negative samples to learn from and having a rather long model-defining region  make the problem harder. this could be due to following reasons:  the experiments give no information on the potential causal portion, if any, along the complete restriction fragment;  the interacting as well as non-interacting partners of a rather long ‘model-defining’ locus could have varying characteristics in them which may not be comprehensively captured by the available few samples in the 5c data; and  the 5c experiments are performed on selected promoter regions and distal enhancers  <cit>  while we make these models trained on such restricted 5c data to predict a potential interaction partner anywhere on the genome not just promoter or distal enhancer regions. thus, learning on 5c data for a very small subset of the chromosome and then predicting interactions chromosome-wide is a very hard problem .

related work
recently, roy et al.  <cit>  developed a model for predicting cell-line specific interactions between only enhancers and promoters using various regulatory genomic datasets. their predictive model learns from interacting and non-interacting pairs, also from 5c data  <cit> , where the participating promoter and enhancer  are encoded as a real or binary vector marking information from  <dig> datasets including histone marks and transcription factor binding for various cell lines. additionally, they also attempt at building a minimal classifier that uses information from  <dig> datasets out of the  <dig>  they achieved a performance ) of ∼ <dig> - <dig>  when training and predicting on the same experiment  data. they also performed tasks of training on 5c data  <cit>  and predicting interactions in high-resolution hi-c data  <cit> . for this task, they consider an interaction involving a 5k bps locus pair as a true interaction if it is called a peak in any one of the three resolutions 5k, 10k and 25k, and achieved comparatively modest performances  of  <dig>   and  <dig>  .

in comparison to the literature for prediction of promoter-enhancer interactions, we have used the term long-range chromatin interactions in a broader sense that includes possible interactions between intervening chromatin regions in addition to those  between specific genomic  elements such as the enhancers and promoters. we hypothesize that the intervening chromatin could play an important role in maintaining a favorable landscape for the loci to interact, as also observed in more recent capture-c experiments data  <cit> , where there is a possibility of weaker interactions due to putative low-affinity binding sites  which, in general, have been largely unexplored still. in our work we have focused on characterizing the long-range chromatin interactions pertaining to a particular genomic locus and investigating the capability of genomic sequence alone in characterizing them. also, for the task of learning on 5c data and predicting on high-resolution hi-c data, we have used a comparatively more stringent criterion for considering an interaction a true one. approaches that use various additional information sources, e.g., epigenetic information  <cit> , typically leave out genomic regions for which these are not available. our sequence-based approach can be especially helpful in such scenarios. furthermore, we expect that our models can be further strengthened or supported by utilizing the additional regulatory genomic information wherever available.

CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge, from the point of view of understanding chromatin interactions at the sequence level, ours is the first approach to do so. in this study, we have taken a broader view of these interactions and based on the hypothesis that the sequence at the intervening chromatin and the loci could also play a part in these interactions given the possibility of such ‘interfacing’ taking place via various mechanisms, like direct contact or formation of mini-loops or via diffusion after mere juxtaposing in physical vicinity  <cit> , and for various reasons as motivated in the “background” section. our computational experiments using data from 5c experiments, for three cell lines gm <dig>  k <dig> and hela-s <dig> from  <cit>  achieve good performances of ∼ <dig>   in the single-task setting.

we developed two new, intuitive visualization methods that are suited for our problem scenario namely dealing with varied-length sequences and an appropriately chosen odh feature representation. aided by these visualizations, notwithstanding the very high-dimensionality of the feature space , our per-locus models shed light on the potential sequence signals that can characterize the interacting vs. the non-interacting partners of a loi. we discussed how this can help understand which sequence features in the given region made it interact with one loi and not with another loi. analysis of the various sequence signals from our models suggests a potential functional and organizational role for tandem repeat sequence stretches in the genome.

we also demonstrated how knowledge of individual models could be transferred to those of other regions  via multitask learning. mean performance for the multitask setting, performances of models for oligomer length  <dig> and  <dig> combined together, is  <dig> . we already observed that several models show less variance in their prediction performances than their single-task counterparts.

furthermore, we made our models trained on 5c data predict interactions between 5k bps long loci from the recent high-resolution hi-c  <cit>  data for cell lines where the hi-c data was available. even with a very stringent criterion to identify true positives in the high-resolution hi-c data, we showed that our approach is capable of predicting interesting loci that could interact although lying very far away, even further than 1–2m bps, on the genome using features learned from 5c data that is limited to this 1–2m bps distance. this ability to identify potentially interacting loci lying very far away on the genome could be useful from the point of view of understanding topologically associating domains at the sequence level.

an important point to note here is that since our models do not require any locus to be either a tcr or an enhancer region per se, in principle, it can be seamlessly applied to contact matrices output by any 5c-based or even high resolution hi-c-based experiments . at places, we have used the terms tcr and enhancers for the interacting regions because the contact matrices we use in this study come from 5c experiments involving these loci. so, when given a hi-c contact matrix, any locus therein could be used to learn corresponding models in a similar fashion and it need not necessarily be an enhancer or a promoter region. in comparison, earlier approaches focus only on promoter-enhancer interactions and exclude all other genomic loci from their analysis. thus, we have preferred to call these genomic loci as simply regions in this study. the models in this work are not specific to particular properties of any genomic region and do not make use of supplementary epigenetic information at the locus; we have only used the sequence information. even with this much harder premise, we still achieved a good performance of ∼ <dig> .

as of today, high resolution hi-c data is still very expensive. therefore, our prediction method could also be used in a setting where high-resolution 5c data, but only low-resolution hi-c data is available to predict additional interaction partners for any regions of interest. these additional predicted contacts could augment methods for predicting the 3d structure of the chromatin as well as methods for predicting boundaries of tads. thus, we envisage that our approach of using only sequence-based models can, most importantly, be helpful in  understanding higher-order structures like  tads at the sequence-level; and  giving additional input to methods that estimate the 3d structure of the chromatin for different organisms from the interaction data.
