BACKGROUND
the parathyroid hormone -family consists of a group of structurally related factors that regulate calcium and bone homeostasis and a multitude of developmental processes , which are mediated by calcium  <cit> . pth, pth-related protein  and the tuberoinfundibular peptide  <dig>  are members of the pth-family in placental mammals. they are encoded by separate genes and in the protein share a conserved n-terminal amino acid sequence, which is involved in receptor binding and activation  <cit> . in non-mammalian tetrapods and fish, an additional family member designated pth-l exists  <cit> . the specific whole genome duplication that occurred in teleost fish means they possess duplicated gene homologues of the mammalian forms of pth  and pthrp   <cit> . peptides of this family are proposed to have emerged early during the vertebrate radiation as suggested by the recent characterization of the pth/pthrp family members in the cartilaginous fish the elephant shark   <cit> . the number of receptors  identified for pth family ligands varies from two in mammals, designated pth1r and pth2r, to three in teleost fish, which do not appear to have the full complement of duplicated pthrs but instead contain mammalian orthologues and a third receptor designated pth3r  <cit> . recently, putative pthr were predicted also in the tunicate ciona intestinalis and in the mollusc antarctic clam laternula elliptica, suggesting that the evolution of pthrs may have predated the vertebrate radiation  <cit> .

pth/pthrp receptors are members of the family  <dig> b <dig> g-protein coupled receptors , a large group of seven transmembrane peptide and neuroendocrine receptors characterised by the presence of a large n-terminal ectodomain  involved in ligand interaction and by a c-terminal domain that is responsible for the activation of the intracellular signalling cascade  <cit> . at the n-ted, six conserved cysteine residues and n-glycosylation sites are responsible for the formation of the ligand-binding pocket. receptor activation triggers different intracellular signalling pathways, including the activation of protein kinases a  and accumulation of camp  <cit>  and phospholipase c leading to protein kinase c  and intracellular ca2+ release  <cit> . moreover, studies using in vitro cell assays and monitoring activation of intracellular signalling pathways established that receptor preference for the mammalian and teleost ligands are different. human and zebrafish pth1r are preferentially activated by both pth and pthrp. zebrafish pth2r binds exclusively to tip <dig> while the human pth2r is also activated by pth  <cit> . pth3r is preferentially activated by pthrp, including fish pthrpa  <cit> . receptor preference for pthrp1b and pth-l remains to be determined.

homologues of the mammalian pth and pthrp and the teleost pth-l genes and transcripts were identified in chicken and xenopus, and preliminary functional studies indicated that the n-terminal peptides are able to stimulate calcium transport  <cit> . as with the human gene, chicken pthrp produces several distinct transcript isoforms, and has a widespread tissue distribution. furthermore, pth was highly expressed in the chicken parathyroid gland and was the most potent peptide promoting calcium transport across the chorionallantois membrane   <cit> . despite the current lack of knowledge about the function of the pth/pthr systems in chicken, putative pthr activated by pthrp were reported in chicken bone and kidney  <cit> . studies describing the action of pth and pthrp on chicken tibial growth plate chondrocytes  suggest that they activate identical intracellular signalling pathways to those described for the mammalian and teleost homologues  <cit> . homologues of pth1r and pth3r are predicted to exist in the chicken genome whereas pth2r and its specific peptide ligand tip <dig> seem to be absent  <cit> . moreover, based upon in silico analysis it has been hypothesised that chicken pth1r may be a pseudogene  <cit> .

the aim of the present study is to contribute for the understanding of the evolution and function of the pth/pthrp system in vertebrates by the isolation and characterisation of the pth/pthrp receptors in chicken. to this end, pthr sequences were identified in silico in the chicken genome and expressed sequence tags  deposited in public databases and the full-length receptors cloned. gene expression in chicken adult and during embryonic development stages were characterised and the relative potency of the n-terminal  region of chicken pth and pthrp in stimulating receptor activation determined by quantification of intracellular camp production and ca2+ accumulation. the origin and evolution of the pth/pthrp systems in the vertebrate radiation was revisited by comparison of chicken ligands and receptors with homologues in other metazoan genomes.

RESULTS
the chicken pth/pthrp receptors
in the chicken genome putative pth1r  and pth3r  were identified. the predicted mature transcripts of chicken pth1r and pth3r are 1614 bp and 1626 bp in length that correspond to deduced proteins of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively, both containing putative signal peptide sequences and sharing 54% overall amino acid sequence identity. the chicken pth1r mrna  was confirmed by rt-pcr on cdna from whole chicken embryos at stage 26hh and from  <dig> ests found in database from stage 20-21hh whole chick embryos , from stage 36hh limbs  and from growth plate chondrocytes . the chicken pth3r  was also confirmed by rt-pcr on the same cdna sample but no est was found. despite thorough database searches and attempts to amplify a chicken pth2r receptor using degenerate primers on genomic dna and cdna a homologue was not identified.

multiple sequence alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of chicken pthrs with mammalian and teleost homologues  revealed the chicken pth1r shares at least 76% similarity to other vertebrate pth1rs and that the chicken pth3r is 71% similar with the zebrafish pth3r. the seven transmembrane domains  and the six cysteine residues at the n-ted are fully conserved across vertebrates  as are four putative n-glycosylation sites  in pth1r two of which are also found in pth3r. the chicken pthr n-ted also contains the residues l <dig>  t <dig>  q <dig>  f <dig>  r <dig>  l <dig> and i <dig> previously identified to be involved in the interaction of mammalian pth1r with pth and pthrp  <cit> . the only amino acid residues in n-ted that are not conserved are l <dig> which is replaced by i <dig> in pth1r and i <dig> which substituted by m <dig> in pth3r . the residues d <dig>  w <dig>  p <dig> and w <dig> which are involved in the structural conformation of the ligand-binding pocket of family  <dig> b <dig> gpcrs  <cit>  are also conserved in the chicken receptor sequences.

pth/pthrp receptor homologues in vertebrate and invertebrate genomes
to place in context the evolution of chicken pthrs, potential pth/pthrp homologues from other vertebrate and invertebrate genomes were retrieved from public databases . in xenopus, and lizard genomes, partial sequences for putative pth1r, pth2r and pth3r were identified. in the bird genomes - zebra finch, turkey and duck - only homologues of the chicken pth1r  and pth3r  genes were retrieved. the deduced mature peptide sequence of the bird pthrs identified are highly conserved with the chicken homologues and share at least 75% and 83% with pth1r and pth3r, respectively. in the recently available genome of the cartilaginous fish, elephant shark, three potential receptors  were identified and in lamprey two pth/pthrp receptors seem to be present . among the invertebrate chordates two potential pth/pthrp receptors were identified in the ciona genome  and in the amphioxus branchiostoma floridae genome  a pth/pthrp receptor gene also appears to be present. amino acid sequence similarity of the predicted ciona_a and ciona_b receptors is 46% and 49%, respectively, with the chicken pth1r and 45% and 47% from amphioxus with the paralogue pth3r. the deduced pth receptor from amphioxus shares 49% and 47% sequence similarity with the chicken pth1r and pth3r, respectively.

pth/pthrp receptor gene structure and short-range gene linkage
the chicken pth1r and pth3r share a complex gene organisation and are composed of  <dig> exons and are identical with the predicted gene structures of their homologues in xenopus and zebrafish . this contrasts to human pth1r that contains  <dig> exons within the mature receptor region. for both chicken pth1r and pth3r, the signal peptide region is encoded within the 1st exon and the tm regions are distributed between the 5th and 13th exon.

gene synteny was maintained for both pth1r and pth3r and linked genes were found in chicken, zebrafish, xenopus and human . the pth1r gene maps to chicken chromosome  <dig>  to human chromosome  <dig>  to xenopus scaffold  <dig>  and to zebrafish chromosome  <dig> and the gene tmie  was found to be conserved within the compared homologue genome regions. the chicken pth3r gene maps to chromosome  <dig> and is homologous to xenopus scaffold_ <dig> and zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  the gene taco <dig>  was found to be common in the teleost and tetrapod genome regions analysed.

despite the apparent absence of a putative pth2r gene, chicken homologue genes that are conserved in the vertebrate pth2r gene environment were also found in a conserved cluster in the chicken genome . the genes idh <dig>  and pip5k <dig>  found in close proximity to the zebrafish, xenopus and human pth2r were identified on chicken chromosome  <dig>  similarly, the human genome homologues of the conserved vertebrate pth3r gene environment were also identified on chromosome  <dig> 

comparative analysis with the homologue genome regions in the ciona genome indicates that ciona pthr  located in scaffold_ <dig> shares gene environment conservation with the vertebrate pth1r. putative homologues of the vertebrate als2cl and jmjd <dig> are also predicted in the ciona homologue genome region, which contrasts with ciona_b gene environment in scaffold_ <dig>  where there was no gene synteny. in the amphioxus genome a homologue of the vertebrate tmie is predicted in close proximity with the putative pthr locus .

phylogenetic analysis of pth/pthrp receptors
phylogenetic analysis of the chicken pth1r and pth3r with the retrieved vertebrate and invertebrate homologues is shown in figure 3a. the consensus tree obtained suggests that the pth/pthrp receptors emerged early during the deuterostome radiation. the vertebrate pthr members shared a common ancestor gene with ciona and amphioxus and have evolved via gene or genome duplications. two major clades are present one containing the vertebrate pth2r and the other clusters pth1r and pth3r. this suggests that after the initial gene duplication they have been under different evolutionary pressure and that the vertebrate pth1r and pth3r are the result of a recent duplication event. the chicken and other avian pth/pthrp receptors cluster within the pth1r/pth3r group, confirming their homology . the three xenopus and lizard pth/pthrp receptors group with the teleost homologues. in ciona the existence of two pthrs appears to be the result of a specific duplication event.

tip <dig> genes in vertebrates
the absence of pth2r in chicken raises questions about the presence in the genome of its putative ligand tip <dig>  searches performed on the chicken genome and est databases failed to identify the homologue of human and teleost tip <dig>  however, a putative tip <dig> gene is predicted in the xenopus  genome and also in non-annotated regions of the lizard , platypus  and opossum  genomes. in addition, in lamprey  and elephant shark  a putative tip <dig> gene also seems to be present. in elephant shark, four pth-family genes were identified clustering with pth, pthrp, tip <dig> and pth-l . no potential tip <dig> gene was identified in the tunicate ciona and amphioxus genomes, suggesting that this gene is specific to vertebrates. phylogenetic analysis of the deduced tip <dig> mature peptides with the pth/pthrp members confirmed that the tip <dig> clade is basal and shared common origin . characterization of the vertebrate tip <dig> gene environment revealed that gene order and gene synteny is only conserved in xenopus and human and no conserved genes were found in teleost and lamprey .

tissue gene expression
tissue expression of the chicken pthrs transcripts was characterised in several adult tissues and during embryo development. the chicken pth1r was detected in all adult tissues and embryo stages analysed . during embryo development pth3r was expressed from stage 4hh  onwards, but was absent or down-regulated in the head of 31hh and 36hh. the chicken pth3r was also detected in most of the adult tissues despite its low level of expression, but highest transcript expression was found in intestine , lung, liver and cartilage .

receptor activation of camp production
the camp accumulation of a stable cell line expressing chicken pth1r and pth3r in the presence of chicken pth, pthrp and pth-l is shown in figure  <dig>  all chicken peptides were able to activate the two receptors in a dose-dependent manner with different half maximal concentrations . furthermore, the accumulation of camp in cells transfected with pth3r was almost one order of magnitude larger compared to those with pth1r. pthrp produced the highest stimulation of pth1r  and together with pth-l was the most efficient peptide . stimulation of pth3r was highest for pthrp and pth, while pth-l  only produced a small camp accumulation above basal levels and was approximately  <dig> times lower than pth and pthrp . the ec <dig> followed the same pattern with pth-l in the μm range . human pth was also able to stimulate chicken pth1r  . human tip <dig> failed to induce accumulation of camp with pth1r and only negligible camp production was obtained for pth3r .

receptor activation of intracellular ca2+
a peptide screen using 1 μm and  <dig> nm of each pth and pthrp peptide revealed that irrespective of the peptide pth3r activation did not cause release of intracellular ca2+ . however, pthrp efficiently stimulated ica2+ accumulation with pth1r with an ec <dig> of  <dig>  nm and pth-l  caused only a slight stimulation and pth had no effect .

discussion
homologs of pth1r and pth3r, but not pth2r, are present in the chicken genome, and are the result of a gene duplication, which occurred prior to the divergence of fish. the chicken pthrs have a widespread tissue distribution and are activated by the n-terminal 1– <dig> fragment of pth-family peptides. the presence in the two receptors of conserved amino acids important for ligand-binding in n-ted and residues w <dig> and q <dig> located within the third extracellular loop and tm <dig>  respectively, suggests the function of the chicken receptors is similar to the human pth1r  <cit> . the genomic structure of chicken pth1r is similar to fish and amphibian while the human homologue gene contains two extra exons: exon  <dig>  which corresponds to an extracellular loop exclusive of the mammalian receptor and exon  <dig> which is the result of intron gain within one of the exons encoding the c-terminus of the receptor  <cit> .

pth1r and pth3r are expressed during chicken development and in many different adult tissues, including the classical calcium-target tissues such as kidney, intestine, bone and cartilage. in human, pth1r is also expressed in kidney and in a variety of other tissues, and is activated by both pth and pthrp, and accounts for the autocrine/paracrine function of pthrp  <cit> . in fish, pth1r was mainly expressed in the scales, liver, gonad, skin, brain and pituitary  <cit> . the xenopus lung epithelium produces pthrp which regulates, through a receptor-mediated mechanism, mesodermal leptin necessary for lung development  <cit> . the receptor responsible is likely to be pth1r, which in xenopus laevis is expressed in lung, brain, skin, kidney and bone  <cit> . there is much less information available about the characteristics of pth3r and in chicken it is most highly expressed in the hindgut, lung and cartilage. in fish, pth3r has been identified in the interrenal tissue where it may regulate cortisol secretion  <cit>  and from intestine where it signals primarily via the adenylate cyclase/protein kinase a  signalling pathway possibly mediating calcium uptake  <cit> .

pthrs are expressed in developing bone/cartilage structures in the embryo and have a key role during development. in mammals, pth1r in association with indian hedgehog  signalling regulate endochondral bone ossification and skeletal development  <cit> . previous studies with chicken embryos reveal that, prior to the appearance of skeletal tissue, pthrp and pth1r are co-expressed by cells of the ectoderm, skeletal muscle, peripheral nerve and mesenchyme  <cit> . hyaline cartilage in chicken first observed at hh <dig>  co-express pthrp and pth1r in chondroblasts but by day  <dig> the chondrocytes do not express the receptor which is present in the perichondrium as well as in preosteoblasts, osteoblasts and osteocytes  <cit> . the calcium necessary for chicken embryo development is likely to be regulated by the egg cam  <cit>  and probably involves the activation of chicken pth1r, which is the only pthr amplified from this tissue. in the current study, the low expression of pth3r in head, legs and limbs but high expression in the body of the developing embryo suggests this receptor may be more important in the development of non-skeletal tissues.

chicken pthrs are activated by pth-family peptides in a dose-dependent manner. pthrp was the most potent peptide overall and stimulated camp accumulation through pth1r and pth3r and had overlapping potency with pth for the latter receptor. mammalian pth1r is activated by both pth and pthrp which have similar potency and stimulate both camp and ica2+ production  <cit> . zebrafish pth1r is activated similarly by the n-terminal peptides of fugu pthrpa, human pthrp and pth and zebrafish pth <dig> but not zebrafish pth <dig> while zebrafish pth3r has preference for fugu pthrpa, human pthrp and zebrafish pth <dig> and pth <dig> but not for human pth  <cit> . human pth activated chicken pth1r and stimulated camp production with an apparently similar potency to chicken pthrp. interestingly, chicken pth-l had a low capacity to activate any of the receptors, which is consistent with its lower potency in stimulating calcium transport across the cam  <cit> . whether pth-l binds to another as yet unidentified receptor or is a less active pth-family member in chicken remains to be established.

of the two chicken receptors, pth3r accumulated one order of magnitude more camp than pth1r. this is to some extent surprising as hek <dig> cells express pth1r at a low level  <cit> . it may indicate that the two receptors use a different complement of signalling molecules  or they may interact with receptor auxiliary proteins which remain to be characterised  <cit> . in contrast, only pth1r stimulates accumulation of ica2+. similar observations were made for zebrafish pth1r and pth3r and activation with pth/pthrp peptides stimulated camp accumulation but only pth1r, was capable of activating ip3/ica2+ signalling  <cit> . in sea bream scales, where only pth1r is expressed, piscine pthrpa activated both the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase a  and phospholipase c/protein kinase c  signalling cascades  <cit> . deletions of n-terminal amino acids in piscine pthrpa reduced camp accumulation, but had no effect on plc/pkc signalling  <cit> . moreover piscine pthrp was also found to stimulate camp accumulation in isolated sea bream enterocytes via pth3r but no activation of the plc/pkc pathway was detected  <cit> . the results of the present study indicate that chicken pth1r and pth3r are functionally different and this observation with the differing tissue expression supports the idea of differential cellular functions. it remains to be established if chicken pthrs activate other intracellular signalling pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase or interact with proteins such as ramps  or calmodulins known to modulate the activity of the mammalian receptor [reviewed by  <cit> .

the functional importance of calcium from single cell organisms to metazoan has required the evolution of mechanisms for its regulation and the suggestion that the pth family may be ancient. for example, it has been suggested that tip <dig> may be present in yeast  <cit>  but this seems to be the consequence of coincident gene names rather than authentic sequence similarity  <cit> . immunohistochemical studies with heterologous antisera suggest that pth exists in invertebrates such as snail, cockroach and amphioxus  <cit> . studies in snail also suggest a potential neuropeptide role for the invertebrate pth/pthr system, as mammalian pth was found to stimulate calcium influx in neurons and induce depolarization and modulation of neural transmission through the inositol-triphosphate second messenger system  <cit> . however, western blot failed to detect pth immunoreactive material in neural extracts of prawn, squid, cuttlefish, starfish, dogfish, skate or hagfish  <cit> . moreover, mining of invertebrate molecular databases failed to identify putative pth-family homologues and their existence remains to be conclusively demonstrated. in contrast, in silico analysis identified potential homologues of the vertebrate pthrs in early deuterostome and protostome genomes  <cit> .

both pth/pthrp and their receptors seem to be present in lamprey and cartilaginous fishes . in the lamprey, the genome region gl <dig> contained two potential pth/pthrp-like genes that shared similarity with the vertebrate homologues and were in linkage with the btbd <dig> gene, which is present in the vertebrate pth gene environment  <cit>  . a putative tip <dig> gene is also present in the lamprey. in the elephant shark besides the previously reported pth  and pthrp homologues  <cit>  putative tip <dig>  and pth-l  genes were identified. this suggests that the gene/genome duplication event that generated the vertebrate pth/pthrp family occurred prior to or early in the origin of vertebrates . however, isolation of full-length lamprey transcripts is still required to permit full characterization of the pth/pthrp family in early vertebrates.

two putative pthr-like receptor genes  and three homologues of the vertebrate pth1r, pth2r and pth3r genes are predicted in the lamprey and elephant shark genomes, respectively, suggesting that the evolution of both peptides and their receptors occurred in the same time-frame. nevertheless, the identification of putative pthrs in invertebrate genomes and the apparent absence of homologues of their vertebrate pth/pthrp ligands suggest that pthrs which occur in the invertebrate lineage pre-dated the emergence of their vertebrate ligands , an evolutionary pattern that is also common to other  <dig> b <dig> gpcr family members  <cit> .

the duplication of pth-family members and their specific receptors has occurred early in the vertebrate radiation. the emergence of seems to have accompanied the proposed two rounds of gene/genome duplication events that occurred at the basis of vertebrates  <cit> . the putative pth1r/pth3r gene precursor and pth2r gene are suggested to have emerged earlier, prior to or at the origin of vertebrates , and pth1r and pth3r genes diverged subsequently prior to the chondrichthyes  radiation . if a putative duplicate pth4r gene existed it was eliminated from the genome.

the origin of pth/pthrp family members and tip <dig> occurred early in vertebrate evolution and probably before the divergence of lamprey since a putative pth-l was found in cartilaginous fish. later in evolution gene deletions occurred as revealed by the absence of pth2r and its ligand tip <dig> in birds, proposed to result from a chromosome segment deletion in the bird genome  <cit> . similarly, pth3r and pth-l are absent from placental mammal genomes . thus, while putative ligands are only discernible in early vertebrates, the receptors seem to have an earlier origin.

CONCLUSIONS
two pthr homologues of the vertebrate pth1r and pth3r were isolated and functionally characterized in chicken. their distinct pattern of expression during embryo development and in adult tissues, together with their distinct activation response to the potential ligands, suggests that they have acquired specific functions, which contributed to their maintenance in the bird genome. the chicken genome lacked a homologue of the vertebrate pth2r and of its specific ligand tip <dig>  a feature shared by all avian genomes analysed. pthr and pth-family members have evolved via gene/genome duplications and deletion events and the identification of putative homologues in the primitive lamprey genome suggests that they emerged early and co-evolved during the vertebrate radiation. knowledge of the role pth/pthrp system in early vertebrates will help to establish their functional evolution.
