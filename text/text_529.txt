BACKGROUND
rice false smut  caused by the clavicipitaceous fungus ustilaginoidea virens, also known as villosiclava virens, has recently become one of the most devastating grain diseases in the majority of rice-planting regions worldwide  <cit> . rfs was first reported in tirunelveli district of tamil nadu state of india and previously categorized as a minor disease due to its sporadic occurrence  <cit> . however, the disease has expanded rapidly in china due to large-scale planting of high-yield rice cultivars and hybrids, heavy application of nitrogenous fertilizer and global warming in the past two decades, and has been found in about one third of rice cultivation areas in severe years  <cit> . rfs outbreaks have also been reported in some american, italian and southern asian rice-growing regions  <cit> . the disease incidence rate was estimated to be  <dig>  % in  <dig> across northern india, and the smut balls formed on up to  <dig> grains per panicle in some fields with high disease severity  <cit> .

aside from huge yield losses  caused by rfs, u. virens produces abundant amounts of mycotoxins that often contaminate rice products and are poisonous to both human and animals . due to the economic importance of the disease, many studies have been performed on the occurrence, pathogen detection, mycotoxin identification, infection lifecycle and chemical control of the disease . however, research on screening of rice germplasm for rfs resistance, molecular mechanisms underlying rfs resistance and the pathogenicity of u. virens is scarce  <cit> . breeding for rice cultivars with durable resistance to rfs is considered to be one of the most economical, environmentally safe and effective strategies for disease management. a rapid and effective inoculation method has been developed to evaluate rice resistance to u. virens and screen resistant germplasm for breeding  <cit> . although no rice variety has yet been identified to have complete or high level of resistance, cultivars do exhibit significant differences in quantitative resistance to u. virens  <cit> . much effort has been taken to identify quantitative trait loci  associated with rice resistance to u. virens . it was reported that the rice cultivar ir <dig> has a relatively high resistance to rfs, which was controlled by two major and multiple minor resistance genes  <cit> . eight qtls controlling rfs resistance were also found in the resistant rice variety lemont  <cit> . however, no qtl for rfs resistance in rice has yet been isolated and resistance mechanisms are largely unknown  <cit> .

in plants, multiple strategies have evolved to recognize pathogens and thus trigger immune systems to defend against pathogen invasion. recognition of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns  by pattern recognition receptors  activates pamp-triggered immunity  and prevents further colonization on the hosts by microbial pathogens  <cit> . perception of pathogen effectors by intercellular r proteins in plants activates effector-triggered immunity , which includes rapid and acute cell death responses in plants and restricts multiplication of pathogens  <cit> . furthermore, systemic acquired resistance  induced by the signal molecule salicylic acid  may confer long-lasting protection against a wide range of pathogens  <cit> .

pathogenesis-related  genes are often induced in plant defense signaling through the action of plant hormones including salicylic acid, jasmonic acid or ethylene  <cit> . in arabidopsis, expression of pr <dig>  pr <dig> and pr <dig> is induced by sa and used as a signature for sar  <cit> . these induced pr proteins possess antimicrobial activities through their hydrolytic, proteinase-inhibitory and membrane-permeabilizing abilities, or serve as defense signals  <cit> . as an example, pr- <dig> proteins function as β- <dig> -glucanases that catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of  <dig> -β-d-glucosidic linkages in β- <dig> -glucans present in the fungal cell walls. the disrupted cell walls cause cell lysis and death in fungi  <cit> . the pr- <dig> proteins possess endo-chitinase activities and retard fungal growth by the enzymatic hydrolysis of chitin, the predominant constituent of fungal cell walls. the released chitin fragments often act as endogenous triggers to stimulate plant defenses  <cit> . peroxidases  are heme-containing glycoproteins that participate in a number of physiological processes, such as biosynthesis of ethylene, suberization and lignification of plant cells in response to pathogen infection, wounding and abiotic stresses  <cit> .

comprehensive transcriptome analyses during the interaction of plants and pathogens are commonly used to provide new insights into molecular mechanisms of plant resistance. transcriptome comparisons between durable resistant and susceptible rice varieties in response to attack by the blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae revealed that chitin-oligosaccharide sensing factors, wall-associated kinases, mapk cascades and wrky transcription factors were involved in rice blast resistance  <cit> . in addition, gene expression profiling of rice in response to the infection of rice stripe virus  and small brown plant-hopper  revealed by transcriptome analyses indicated that the jasmonate signaling pathway was important in rice resistance to sbphs  <cit> . transcriptome analyses were also performed for other host-pathogen interaction through rna-seq, including wheat and fusarium graminearum  <cit> , maize and sporisorium reilianum f. sp. zeae  <cit> , cotton and the wilt fungus verticillium dahliae  <cit> , soybean and xanthomonas axonopodis pv. glycines  <cit> , banana and f. oxysporum f. sp. cubense  <cit> . many genes were thereby revealed to be involved in resistance-associated signal transduction and defense mechanism in plants. for example, pr genes were found to be significantly up-regulated in rice after blast fungus inoculation  <cit>  and in the maize resistant variety mo <dig> in response to s. reilianum f. sp. zeae  <cit> .

recently, rna-seq has been used to reveal stage-specific biological processes related to the compatible rice-u. virens interaction and expression profiling in rice varieties at the late stage of u. virens infection  <cit> . it was reported that the primary site of u. virens colonization was at the base of the filaments with the inner spikelets becoming infected by hyphae at 24 h post inoculation   <cit> . here, we analyzed and compared gene expression profiles of the rfs resistant variety ir <dig> and susceptible lyp <dig> after u. virens inoculation at early stages  using transcriptome data. the results indicate that several major gene families might be involved in rice resistance to u. virens infection, including receptor-like kinases, pr genes, diterpene phytoalexin biosynthesis genes and wrky transcription factors. these results provide important information to further understand molecular mechanisms of rice reaction and resistance to false smut.

RESULTS
disease symptoms of false smut in rice cultivars ir <dig> and lyp9
to confirm rfs resistance or susceptibility of ir <dig> and lyp <dig>  disease symptoms were observed on the panicles inoculated with different u. virens isolates. infected grains per inoculated spikelet of the cultivars ir <dig> and lyp <dig> were counted . in general, more false smut balls were produced on lyp <dig> panicles than those on ir <dig> panicles for each of three isolates. the average number of false smut balls per panicle formed on lyp <dig>  was significantly more than that on ir <dig>  after p <dig> inoculation. the number of false smut balls produced on both cultivars inoculated with 37– <dig> and 39– <dig> was less than that formed on the panicles after p <dig> inoculation. these data confirm that the cultivar ir <dig> is much more resistant to u. virens than lyp <dig>  the results also indicate that virulence to both rice cultivars of the isolates 37– <dig> and 39– <dig> is much less than that of p <dig>  therefore, the p <dig> isolate was chosen for inoculation in further expression profiling analyses.table  <dig> virulence assays of three u. virens isolates  to the varieties ir <dig> and lyp <dig>  showing that ir <dig> is significantly more resistant to u. virens infection than lyp9

rna-seq data and aligning to the reference genomes
changes in gene expression level of rice cultivars ir <dig> and lyp <dig> at 24 h and 48 h after p <dig> inoculation were analyzed using rna-seq data. a total of  <dig>  million clean reads, each of which was 49 bp in length, were generated from eight cdna libraries . about 82 % of the clean reads were successfully aligned to the oryza sativa l. spp. indica reference genome . saturation analysis showed that newly emerging tags were gradually reduced as the total number of sequence tags increased, and the detectable tags approached saturation when the number of sequencing tags reached ~ <dig> million . these results indicate that the gene transcript data were reliable, and suitable for further transcriptome analysis.

expression profiling analyses in resistant and susceptible cultivars in response to u. virens inoculation
to uncover the genes that might be involved in rfs resistance, all differentially expressed genes  were identified in ir <dig> and lyp <dig> at 24 h and 48 h after p <dig> inoculation as compared with mock-inoculated samples. venn diagrams were then drawn to show degs that were common to both rice genotypes ir <dig> and lyp <dig>  or specific to either cultivar in response to p <dig> inoculation . a total of  <dig> degs were identified in ir <dig> at  <dig> hpi, among which  <dig> were ir28-specific,  <dig> were common to ir <dig> and lyp <dig>  and  <dig> were degs only in ir <dig> but were expressed  in lyp <dig>  in contrast,  <dig> degs were identified in lyp <dig> including  <dig> lyp9-specific and  <dig> were degs only in lyp <dig> but expressed in ir <dig>  meanwhile,  <dig> and  <dig> degs were identified in ir <dig> and lyp <dig> at  <dig> hpi, respectively. among them,  <dig> were identified as degs common to ir <dig> and lyp <dig>  and  <dig> were categorized as degs only in ir <dig> but expressed in lyp9;  <dig> were lyp9-specific, and  <dig> were found as degs only in lyp <dig> but expressed in ir <dig>  among common degs shared by both cultivars at  <dig> hpi, more genes were up-regulated in ir <dig>  than in lyp <dig>  while fewer degs  in ir <dig> were down-regulated than those  in lyp <dig>  among  <dig> common degs at  <dig> hpi, more  were up-regulated compared with down-regulated ones  in ir <dig>  while many more genes  were suppressed than transcriptionally induced genes  in lyp <dig> at this infection stage . interestingly, the majority of common degs  exhibited opposite expression patterns between the resistant and susceptible varieties after p <dig> inoculation, suggesting that defense responses are distinctively different between the two varieties in response to u. virens infection. we speculate that the ir28-specific degs and common degs which were up-regulated in ir <dig> and down-regulated in lyp <dig> might be involving in rfs resistance .fig.  <dig> venn diagrams of all differentially expressed genes in the resistant variety ir <dig> and susceptible variety lyp <dig> in the early stages of u. virens infection. a the expressed genes  and differentially expressed genes  in ir <dig>  and lyp <dig>  at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi. a total of  <dig> degs were common in ir <dig> and lyp <dig> at  <dig> hpi while  <dig> degs were common at  <dig> hpi. b up-regulated and down-regulated genes among common degs in ir <dig> and lyp <dig> at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi. among common degs, more degs were up-regulated in ir <dig> while more degs were down-regulated in lyp9



comparison between transcriptomes of ir <dig> and lyp <dig> in response to u. virens infection by cluster analysis
a total of  <dig> degs in ir <dig> and in lyp <dig> were classified through cluster analysis. the heat map generated by cluster analysis showed that the majority of degs have similar expression patterns between two different time points in the same cultivar. the analysis also showed that these degs can be categorized into four major groups: genes down-regulated in both ir <dig> and lyp <dig> ; genes up-regulated in ir <dig> while down-regulated in lyp <dig> ; genes up-regulated in both ir <dig> and lyp <dig> ; and genes up-regulated in lyp <dig> while suppressed in ir <dig>  . it was speculated that the genes specifically up-regulated in ir <dig> may play important roles in rfs resistance.fig.  <dig> the expression pattern of differentially regulated genes in ir <dig> and lyp <dig> during the early stages of u. virens infection. a total of  <dig> genes were identified to be differentially regulated in ir <dig> and lyp <dig> in response to u. virens at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi. each column represents the log <dig> fold change in transcript levels in rice at the indicated times, relative to the levels of mock-inoculated samples. the vertical dimension represents the genes that exhibited changes in transcript level . the colour scale indicates transcript abundance relative to the mock-inoculated panicles: red, increase in relative transcript abundance; blue, decrease in relative transcript abundance



gene ontology enrichment analysis
to investigate functions or biological processes that the differentially regulated genes might be involved in, gene ontology  enrichment analysis was performed to classify up-regulated degs . within three major go categories ,  <dig> common go terms,  <dig> ir28-specific and  <dig> lyp9-specific go terms were enriched at  <dig> hpi, while  <dig> common go,  <dig> ir28-specific and  <dig> lyp9-specific go terms were enriched at  <dig> hpi. the gene names in the go terms enriched specifically by ir <dig> were searched for items that might be related to rfs resistance. among them, the go term “transferase activity” was the only one that was significantly enriched  in ir <dig> at both inoculation time points. it is most likely that some genes with transferase activity are involved in rfs resistance .

some protein kinases including receptor-like kinases are likely involved in rfs resistance
the  <dig> degs in ir <dig> that were categorized into the go term “transferase activity” were subject to pfam domain searches. the results showed that the majority of these degs belonged to two gene families encoding protein kinases and glutathione s transferases . comparison of gene expression levels between the resistant and susceptible cultivars showed that expression of glutathione s transferases was not significantly different between ir <dig> and lyp <dig>  in contrast, the differentially-regulated protein kinases exhibited distinctive expression patterns between the two cultivars . twenty-eight and  <dig> protein kinase genes were induced in ir <dig> at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi, respectively . notably,  <dig> protein kinase genes were up-regulated at both inoculation time points. all of the induced protein kinase genes in ir <dig> at  <dig> hpi except bgiosga <dig> were transcriptionally suppressed in lyp <dig>  meanwhile, the up-regulated kinase genes at  <dig> hpi in ir <dig> except bgiosga <dig> and bgiosga <dig> were also down-regulated in lyp <dig> . these differentially regulated kinases were classified into four groups, b-lectin receptor-like kinases, leucine-rich repeat  receptor-like kinases, lysm domain-containing receptor kinases and cytoplasmic kinases . in particular, a b-lectin receptor kinase gene  was dramatically induced at both time points. another b-lectin receptor kinase gene  and a protein kinase gene  were found to be greatly up-regulated with 239- and 306-fold expression in ir <dig> at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi, respectively. divergent patterns of expression in the resistant and susceptible cultivars strongly suggest that these kinase-encoding genes might be essential for rice resistance to rfs in ir <dig> fig.  <dig> the protein kinase genes exhibiting opposite expression patterns between ir <dig> and lyp <dig> in response to u. virens infection. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> protein kinase genes were identified to have opposite expression patterns between the two genotypes at  <dig> hpi  and  <dig> hpi . bold fonts indicate the protein kinase genes that have a consistent expression pattern between two inoculation time points. lectin, lrr, lysm and kinase indicate lectin-receptor like kinases, leucine-rich repeat containing receptor-like kinases and lysin motif-containing receptor-like kinases and cytoplasmic kinases, respectively



expression profiles of pathogenesis-related genes
to identify other important genes that might be involved in biosynthetic or signaling pathways critical for rfs resistance in ir <dig>  pathway enrichment analyses were performed using kegg . only a few defense-associated biosynthetic pathways involving diterpenoid, cutin, suberine or wax were enriched in the transcriptome of the resistant cultivar, while more pathways, such as phenylalanine metabolism and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, were significantly enriched in both rice genotypes after inoculation. comparisons of expression levels of degs in these enriched pathways revealed that many genes were up-regulated in the resistant cultivar, while down-regulated in the susceptible lyp <dig>  among them, multiple gene families encoding pr proteins were greatly up-regulated after p <dig> inoculation in ir <dig> .fig.  <dig> heat maps showing expression patterns of pathogenesis-related and pal genes that were identified to be differentially regulated in ir <dig> and lyp <dig>  the technical details and the colour scale are the same as those in fig. 2




five β- <dig> -glucanase genes belonging to the pr <dig> family exhibited significantly different expression patterns between ir <dig> and lyp <dig> after p <dig> inoculation . in ir <dig>  these genes were transcriptionally induced at  <dig> hpi and up-regulated even more dramatically at  <dig> hpi. in contrast, these genes were generally suppressed or not significantly regulated at both time points in lyp <dig>  extensive transcriptome analyses in both cultivars also showed that three class i , two class ii  and  <dig> class iii chitinase genes  were up-regulated at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi in ir <dig>  while these genes were generally down-regulated at the two time points in lyp <dig> . it is interesting to note that genes bgiosga <dig> to  <dig>  bgiosga <dig>  bgiosga <dig>  bgiosga <dig> and bgiosga <dig> were tandemly arranged in a chitinase gene cluster on chromosome  <dig>  in addition,  <dig> peroxidase genes ,  <dig> thaumatin-like genes  and  <dig> proteinase inhibitor genes  were identified as being induced in ir <dig> while most were inhibited in lyp <dig> after p <dig> inoculation. phenylalanine ammonia-lyases , sometimes classified as pr proteins, are involved in the synthesis of both phytoalexins and lignin, to inhibit pathogens from penetrating cell walls  <cit> . three pal genes  involved in the phenylalanine metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways were also up-regulated only in ir <dig> . taken together, our finding that many defense-related genes including pr and pal genes showed opposite expression patterns between ir <dig> and lyp <dig> after u. virens inoculation indicates that these genes play essential roles in rfs resistance in ir <dig> 

diterpene phytoalexin biosynthesis genes
a total of  <dig> phytoalexins  have been characterized in rice, including  <dig> diterpenoid pas and one flavonoid pa, sakuranetin  <cit> . the diterpenoid pas in rice have been categorized into four distinct types: phytocassanes a to e, oryzalexins a to f, momilactones a and b, and oryzalexin s  <cit> . many essential genes involved in phytoalexin biosynthesis pathways were previously identified . among them, seven genes were significantly up-regulated in ir <dig> at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi, and enriched specifically in degs of the resistant cultivar revealed by kegg pathway enrichment analyses. these genes included oscps <dig>  which is involved in the phytocassane a-e synthesis, oscps <dig> , cyp99a <dig> , cyp99a <dig> , and osmas  which are involved in the biosynthesis of momilactone a and b, cyp76m <dig>  that catalyzes the biosynthesis of oyzalexin a-f, and osksl <dig>  . up-regulation of these phytoalexin biosynthesis genes in response to u. virens indicates that phytoalexins are important components in rice resistance to rfs.fig.  <dig> the genes involved in phytoalexin biosynthesis were specifically induced in the resistant variety ir <dig> in response to u. virens infection. known genes that are responsible for the biosynthesis of different types of phytoalexins were shown. genes in bold were identified to be up-regulated in ir28



differential expression of wrky transcription factors
wrky transcription factors are one of the largest protein superfamilies in plants that can regulate various defense processes and play important roles in controlling the transcription of defense-related genes through binding to w-boxes in their promoters, a key cis-element in defense-related transcriptional regulation  <cit> . here, we identified  <dig> wrky genes that were differentially expressed in ir <dig> and lyp <dig> after p <dig> inoculation . in ir <dig>  five wrky transcription factors were found to be significantly up-regulated. among them, oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> genes were induced at both time points in ir <dig> and significantly inhibited at  <dig> hpi in lyp <dig>  suggesting that these wrky proteins might function as key positive regulators in the rice defense against the infection by u. virens during initial colonization.fig.  <dig> heat map for differentially-regulated wrky genes between ir <dig> and lyp <dig>  a total of  <dig> wrky genes were identified to be differentially regulated in ir <dig> and lyp <dig>  the technical details and the colour scale are the same as those in fig. 2




the cis-acting regulatory element analysis
venn diagrams in additional file 12: figure s <dig> showed up-regulated and down-regulated degs with consistent expression patterns at both time points in ir <dig> and lyp <dig> in response to p <dig> inoculation . in ir <dig>   <dig> genes exhibited similar expression patterns between  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi, including  <dig> induced and  <dig> suppressed genes. in susceptible lyp <dig>   <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated simultaneously at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi. the conserved cis-elements in the promoter regions of the degs with similar expression patterns may provide clues as to how rice plants respond to pathogen infection. eleven conserved motifs including five core elements of w-box and several dna binding sites of dof and myb transcription factors were identified when comparing the promoter regions of up-regulated genes with those of down-regulated genes in ir <dig> . w-boxes, the binding sites of wrky transcription factors, were significantly more abundant in the 5’-regulatory regions of up-regulated degs in ir <dig>  strikingly, cis-element scanning in the place database revealed that a cis-element ctagctag, where the ry repeat motif has been found to be essential for seed-specific expression of some storage proteins, was identified to be significantly more enriched in the promoter regions of up-regulated pr genes as compared to other pr genes in ir <dig> . the cis-element is even more abundant in the promoters of the up-regulated chitinase gene cluster. for comparison, the frequency of the cis-element in the  <dig> up-regulated kinase gene promoters is similar to that in other coding genes in the genome. these data suggest that the ry repeat is a cis-regulatory motif that is involved in the regulation of defense-related genes.table  <dig> ry repeat motifs enriched in the 5’-regulatory regions of  <dig> pr genes, particularly in  <dig> chitinase genes, which were up-regulated in ir <dig> and suppressed in lyp9

validation of degs by quantitative rt-pcr analyses
to validate the degs identified by comparative transcriptome analyses,  <dig> degs that might be essential for rfs resistance were selected, and expression of these genes in response to pathogen inoculation was investigated by quantitative real-time rt-pcr . the qrt-pcr results showed that most of the tested genes were generally up-regulated at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi in the resistant ir <dig> and down-regulated in the susceptible lyp <dig> . the correlation between rna-seq and qrt-pcr data was further validated by comparing the corresponding expression data from both analyses. the log <dig> ratio values from transcriptome analyses were plotted against those from qrt-pcr. a clear correlation between two methods was found at r2 =  <dig>  . in general, qrt-pcr data confirm expression patterns of these important rfs resistance-related genes revealed by rna-seq analyses.fig.  <dig> time-course expression analyses and validation of nine selected degs using quantitative real time rt-pcr. a quantitative rt-pcr analyses of nine selected degs confirmed that these genes were up-regulated in ir <dig> and generally suppressed in lyp <dig> at both  <dig> and  <dig> hpi. log <dig> fold change of transcript levels in the inoculated samples with respect to the transcript levels in mock-inoculated rice panicles was shown. error bars represent standard errors for three replicates of qrt-pcr assays. b the linear correlation between rna-seq transcriptome profiles and qrt-pcr data. the log <dig> ratio values from transcriptome data were plotted against those of the qrt-pcr results. a correlation coefficient of  <dig>  indicates that there is a good linear correlation between rna-seq and qrt-pcr data



comparison of u. virens transcriptome in the resistant and susceptible cultivars during infection
to compare expression profiles of u. virens during infection of the resistant and susceptible cultivars, clean rna-seq reads were mapped to the reference genome of u. virens  <cit>  . expression profiles of u. virens from the infected resistant cultivar ir <dig> were analyzed and compared with those from lyp <dig> described previously  <cit> . in ir <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> fungal genes were up-regulated significantly at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi compared with that from axenic cultures, respectively. meanwhile,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were identified to be suppressed at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, respectively. interestingly, predicted host-pathogen interaction database  genes  <cit>  that are probably involved in host-pathogen interactions were found to be significantly enriched in fungal degs from both rice genotypes, indicating their potential roles in pathogenicity of u. virens.

as shown in venn diagrams , gene expression profiles of u. virens in the resistant cultivar ir <dig> were much different from those in the susceptible lyp <dig>  although  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes have similar expression patterns during infection of the resistant and susceptible cultivars at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, respectively. go enrichment analyses revealed that u. virens degs in two cultivars, especially for down-regulated genes, were enriched in different go terms . interestingly, go terms in biological processes that are related to fungal multiplication and pathogenicity, such as reproductive process, sexual and asexual reproduction, sporulation and cell adhesion, were significantly enriched in down-regulated genes in the resistant ir <dig>  but not in the susceptible lyp <dig>  these results suggest that biological processes required for successful infection of u. virens are greatly suppressed in the resistant cultivar.

discussion
rfs is a newly emerging fungal disease that causes severe yield loss and toxin contamination in rice grains  <cit> . screening of rice genetic germplasm for rfs resistance revealed that certain cultivars exhibit relatively stable rfs resistance although no resistance gene has been reported so far. however, little is known about molecular mechanisms underlying durable resistance to rfs in rice. rna-seq is a recently developed approach that can be used in transcriptome analyses to reveal genome-wide expression profiling and regulation in plant hosts in response to pathogen infection. the technique has several advantages over other methods. first, rna-seq, unlike hybridization-based approaches, can detect gene transcripts despite not having the genome sequence of the target species. second, rna-seq has low background noice  <cit> . third, the technology has a higher sensitivity than dna microarray and can be used to detect a larger dynamic range of expression levels of gene transcripts  <cit> .

in this study, rna-seq was used to identify genes differentially expressed between the cultivar ir <dig> with durable rfs resistance and susceptible cultivar lyp <dig> in response to u. virens at early infection stages. comparative transcriptome analyses suggest that some important protein families including receptor-like kinases, wrky transcription factors, pr proteins, and phytoalexin biosynthetic enzymes play important roles in rfs resistance. a clear correlation between rna-seq and qrt-pcr data confirmed expression patterns of the tested genes in response to u. virens infection . several transcriptome studies on the interaction of rice and u. virens have been reported recently  <cit> . different from other transcriptome analyses, we analyzed and compared transcriptome profiles of the resistant and susceptible rice cultivars at the very early stage of infection . although gene expression profiles were partially different among those studies, a large proportion of degs revealed here were also reported in other transcriptome analyses. for instance, wrky transcription factors, such as wrky <dig> and wrky <dig>  were induced in different transcriptome studies. additionally, some genes that had unique responses to u. virens infection revealed by chao et al.  <cit> , such as loc_os07g <dig>  and loc_os08g <dig> , had similar expression patterns in this study. difference in expression patterns of partial degs might be due to different infection stages and different rice genotypes. it has been found that many rice genes had opposite regulation patterns between the early and late stages of u. virens infection  <cit> .

pathogenesis-related proteins may be crucial for rfs resistance
cluster analyses showed that the majority of degs  in both genotypes were differentially regulated between the two cultivars in response to u. virens inoculation . among the group ii genes,  <dig> pr genes were identified including members in the pr2- <dig>  pr <dig> and pr <dig> families . some pr proteins, such as β- <dig> -glucanases, chitinases and proteinases have direct antifungal activities and hydrolyze molecules on the cell walls of fungal pathogens, including glucans, chitins and proteins directly  <cit> . other pr proteins including thaumatin-like proteins and proteinase inhibitors have enzyme inhibitory activities and exert an effect against fungi by inactivating proteinases secreted by pathogens  <cit> . in addition, the peroxidase activity of pr- <dig> also contributes to fungal disease resistance by cross-linking and strengthening plant cell walls  <cit> .

consistent with our findings, pr genes in rice have been shown to be induced by diverse biotic stresses including infection by the rice blast fungus m. oryzae  <cit> , the bacterial blight pathogen xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae  <cit> , the sheath blight fungus rhizoctonia solani  <cit> , and the rice dwarf virus   <cit> . these expression data suggest that pr genes have important roles in plant defenses against pathogen infection, which has been experimentally verified. previous studies demonstrated that over-expression of the pr genes encoding β- <dig> -glucanases, chitinases and thaumatin-like proteins enhanced resistance to fusarium head blight in wheat .

preliminary mapping using  <dig> recombinant inbred lines derived from an inter-subspecies cross of daguandao/ir <dig> identified a qtl conferring rfs resistance in the chromosome  <dig> in ir <dig>  <cit> . the qtl is physically close to the chitinase gene cluster region, out of which, nine chitinase genes were identified to be highly induced after u. virens inoculation . another study showed that a qtl conferring resistance to r. solani was also mapped near to the chitinase gene cluster region  <cit> , suggesting that the chitinase gene cluster might be involved in broad-spectrum and durable disease resistance. notably, clean rna-seq reads of the susceptible cultivar lyp <dig> were mapped to these chitinase genes and it was found that no gene in the chitinase cluster was absent from the genome of lyp <dig>  collectively, these differentially regulated pr genes in the resistant and susceptible genotypes might play essential roles in rice resistance against u. virens.

diterpene phytoalexins are important for rfs resistance
diterpene phytoalexins, secondary metabolites with a low molecular mass, have anti-microbial activity and play important roles in plant defense responses  <cit> . in this study, seven diterpene phytoalexin biosynthesis genes were identified to be significantly up-regulated in the resistant variety and weakly or not induced in the susceptible variety after inoculation . among them, oscps <dig>  cyp99a <dig>  cyp99a <dig> and osmas are responsible for different steps in the biosynthesis of momilactone a and b . knock-down of oscps <dig> caused lower accumulation levels of momilactones and oryzalexin s and the cps <dig> rice mutant is more susceptible to m. oryzae infection than the wild-type  <cit> . simultaneous knock-down of cyp99a <dig> and cyp99a <dig> specifically suppressed elicitor-inducible production of momilactones  <cit> . additionally, oscps <dig> and cyp76m <dig> are physically located on the same gene cluster involved in biosynthesis of the antifungal phytocassanes  <cit> . oscps <dig> expression in the resistant rice cultivar il <dig> was up-regulated at  <dig> d after m. oryzae inoculation, resulting in enhanced phytoalexin production  <cit> . osksl <dig> is another gene where expression was elevated in ir <dig> after u. virens infection. osksl <dig> has been found to react with syn-cdp and produce syn-stemod-13-ene  <cit> . these results suggest that production of phytoalexins, in particular momilactones, is highly induced by u. virens infection in rice and can play a key role in rfs resistance.

conserved cis-elements are involved in the regulation of defense responses against u. virens infection
a recent study reported that the u. virens regulated genes shared highly conserved cis-elements in the promoters including w-boxes, the dna binding sites of myb and dof proteins, which is highly consistent with our cis-element enrichment analyses   <cit> . wrky transcription factors are vital components in plant defense against pathogens  <cit> . wrky proteins can regulate phytoalexin production and pr gene expression through binding to the cis-regulatory element w-box. this study revealed that  <dig> wrky transcription factors were differentially regulated in both the resistant and susceptible cultivars after u. virens infection. in particular, oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> were found to be highly up-regulated in ir <dig> and suppressed in lyp <dig> . it was demonstrated that transgenic rice plants over-expressing oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> exhibited enhanced resistance to blast disease and x. oryzae pv. oryzae infection . both dof and myb proteins are also important transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of plant defenses and biotic stress resistance  <cit> . taken together, these findings imply that some wrky, dof and myb transcription factors, such as oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig>  play important roles in rice transcriptome regulation during u. virens infection.

furthermore, the cis-regulatory ry repeat motif was found to be significantly more abundant in the promoter regions of these differentially regulated pr genes than other pr genes, even though the motif is generally enriched in the pr gene promoters. these results suggest that the seed-specific cis-element may be also involved in the expression regulation of defense-related genes in response to u. virens infection.

defense-oriented reprogramming of protein kinase genes in rice during early infection of u. virens
many protein kinase genes were reported to be transcriptionally regulated in host plants upon pathogen infection  <cit> . in agreement with this, we found here that  <dig> protein kinase genes were highly induced in ir <dig> after u. virens infection. among these, three categories of receptor-like kinases including lectin-, lrr- and lysm-containing transmembrane kinases were identified which are often involved in the recognition of pathogens by sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns  <cit> . many lysm receptor-like kinases can mediate plant defense responses against fungal pathogens likely through chitin perception  <cit> . bgiosga <dig>  a lectin receptor kinase, was also identified to be induced in response to bacterial, parasite, fungal and viral infection in rice  <cit> . other up-regulated kinase genes encode cytoplasmic kinases that function in the phospho-relay and are essential components in defense signaling. for instance, osmapkk <dig> is phosphorylated by upstream mapkkk <dig>  that was induced by u. virens infection in ir <dig>  which prompts signal transduction in response to various biotic and abiotic stresses including pathogen, insect, drought, salinity, flood and cold  <cit> . therefore, we speculate that these differential regulated protein kinases may play crucial roles in rfs resistance signaling.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, comparison of expression profiles between the resistant cultivar ir <dig> and the susceptible lyp <dig> during early stages of u. virens infection uncovered a clear difference in the regulation of defense responses against u. virens between the two genotypes. a genome-wide view of expression profiles of the resistant rice cultivar in response to u. virens infection promotes understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying rfs resistance. a specific set of protein kinases, pr proteins, wrky transcription factors, and secondary metabolites including phytoalexins were found to be crucial for rfs resistance. transgenic rice plants over-expressing some of the identified genes are being developed to confirm their biological functions in rfs resistance. the information revealed by transcriptome analyses will also facilitate the isolation of qtls associated with resistance to u. virens in rice.
