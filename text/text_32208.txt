BACKGROUND
heart failure , a condition in which the heart is unable to adequately pump blood to rest of the body, is a leading cause of death worldwide. estimates indicate that the current prevalence rate of hf is  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  new cases are reported annually in the united states alone  <cit> . while hf tends to be more prevalent in men than women in the age group of  <dig> to 79 years , women 80 years or older are more prone to the disease than men in that age group   <cit> . furthermore, the prevalence of hf is projected to increase from  <dig>  % in  <dig> to  <dig>  % in  <dig>  and the economic loss resulting from hf is expected to double , in spite of continued efforts to contain the disease’s occurrence in the general population  <cit> .

various cardiovascular disease conditions have been implicated in the development of hf. these include pericardial and valvular diseases, atherosclerosis, hypertension, chronic ischemia, arrhythmia, diabetes, and myocarditis. among the infectious causes, myocarditis has been identified as one important cause of hf in children and young adults. while most individuals affected with myocarditis may remain asymptomatic, 10 % can develop clinical heart disease. a proportion of these chronically affected individuals may develop dilated cardiomyopathy , and approximately half of them may undergo heart transplantation due to the lack of effective treatment options.

furthermore, it is estimated that approximately  <dig> million americans appear to have inflammatory heart infiltrates, raising the possibility that a subset of people may have an ongoing silent myocarditis  <cit> . two observations support this notion:  apparently healthy individuals like athletes can die from sudden death syndrome, and their autopsies suggest the presence of inflammatory infiltrates  <cit> , and  a necropsy study involving more than  <dig>  victims of accidental deaths not related to any cardiovascular diseases showed evidence of myocarditis in  <dig>  % of cases  <cit> . thus, identifying the triggers of myocarditis may provide opportunities to treat affected individuals in a timely fashion.

the molecular mimicry hypothesis has been proposed as one major mechanism for the occurrence of autoimmune diseases including myocarditis, whereby the structural similarities between self and foreign antigens lead to recognition of self-antigens by generating cross-reactive immune responses  <cit> . numerous examples exist to support this theory in various disease conditions, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis/multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis/uveitis and experimental autoimmune myocarditis/heart autoimmunity . the importance of the molecular mimicry hypothesis can be summarized with two major predictable outcomes.  as the genomes of more microbes are sequenced, the search for mimicry sequences in the microbial databases has become relatively easy. these searches may result in the identification of microbes that are either natural pathogens of humans or are otherwise innocuous environmental isolates, but with the potential for them to trigger autoimmune diseases in those exposed.  exposure to microbes carrying the mimicry sequences may result in the generation of cross-reactive immune responses leading to the induction of organ-specific autoimmunity. in our investigations, we identified a mimicry sequence for cardiac myosin heavy chain -α 334- <dig> contained in bacillus sp. nrrl b-14911; the epitope, termed bac 25- <dig>  induces myocarditis by active immunization in a/j mice  <cit> .

because the biological and medical significance of this bacterium was not known, particularly regarding pathogenicity, we sought to analyze the complete genome of the organism to determine its phenotypic and virulence characteristics. by adopting phylogenetic analysis of 16s ribosomal rna  genes, sequence analysis of the 16s-23s rdna intergenic transcribed spacers , phenotypic microarray , and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight  mass spectrometry , we propose the species and strain of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> to be bacillus infantis nrrl b- <dig>  the availability of the complete genome sequence for this bacterium may facilitate genetic manipulations to assess gene functions associated with bacterial survival and virulence. additionally, this bacterium can serve as a useful tool to establish a novel disease model for autoimmune myocardial damage of infectious origin.

comparison of conserved its sequences between bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> and b. infantis based on genomic dna pcr analysis
because that 16s-23s rdna its sequences are hypervariable, but conserved within the same species, their sequence analyses have been successfully used for speciation of the genus bacillus . briefly, 16s-23s rdna its regions were amplified from the genomic dna extracted from bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> and b. infantis jcm 13438 t using the primers specific to bacillus genus as described previously  <cit> . the primer sequences used were: 5'-gtcgtaacaaggtagccgta-3'/5'-caaggcatccaccgt-3'; 5'-ccttgtacacaccgcccgt-3'/5'-aaaatagctttttggtggag-3' ; and 5'-aaatttgtatgggcctatag- 3'/5'-gtgggtttccccattcgg-3', and the amplifications were performed using the following conditions: 94o c for 4 min followed by 32 cycles, each consisting of 94o c for 1 min, 54o c for 1 min, 72o c for 2 min with a final extension at 72o c for 10 min. after resolving the pcr products in 1 % agarose gel, the pcr amplicons were excised, purified using gel extraction kit  and subjected for sequencing. after excluding the 16s and 23s rdna sequences from the amplicons, the nucleotide sequences representing only the its regions were recovered, and their percent identities were analyzed using william pearson’s lalign program .

the bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> and b. infantis jcm 13438 t cells grown in lb broth at 37o c were plated onto tryptic soy agar with 5 % sheep blood agar plates. following overnight incubation, individual colonies were picked and spotted onto the maldi-tof target. the spots were overlaid with 1 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid  matrix , and the mass spectra were acquired using maldi-tof ms, microflex lt system in a linear positive mode . instrument calibration was performed using standard reference bts escherichia coli . for bacterial identification, maldi biotyper  <dig> , reference library  <dig>  version  <dig> . <dig> was used  <cit> . the cut-off scores used for species identification were:  <dig>  to  <dig> –highly probable species identification;  <dig>  to  <dig> –secure genus identification and probable species identification;  <dig>  to  <dig> –probable genus identification; and  <dig>  to  <dig> –not reliable for species identification.

sequence analysis of allantoate amidohydrolase gene

analysis of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> genome for virulence factors
the virulence factor database  is a database constructed by the virulence-guided classification system. the core dataset of vfdb  consisting of  <dig> virulence factors  from  <dig> vf-related genes representing  <dig> genera of pathogenic microbes  <cit>  was downloaded and used as the database for protein sequence similarity search. using this information, we performed three types of analyses: first, we identified potential virulence factors from the proteins encoded in the bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> genome using protein basic local alignment search tool    <cit> ; second, we blasted the proteomes of three pathogenic bacilli ; and three non-pathogenic bacilli  against the protein sequences in the vfdb database to identify the potential virulence factors present in the respective groups. these were then compared with those of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> to identify the virulence factors unique to this bacterium; and third, we compared the virulence factors of the pathogenic bacilli as described above with those of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> to identify those that are common to both. the thresholds used were e-value of 1×10- <dig> and bit score of  <dig>  cgview server was used to draw the circular map to show the location of potential virulence factor genes in bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig>  <cit> .

comparative analysis of the bacillus genomes
for comparative genomic analysis of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> with other species within the genus bacillus, we downloaded the complete genome annotations of b. subtilis strain  <dig> , b. megaterium dsm  <dig> , b. thuringiensis serovar kurstaki strain hd <dig>  and b. cereus atcc  <dig>  from the ncbi database. the presence or absence of genes encoding methyltransferases and transporters as well as insertion sequence  elements was determined based on the “product” assignments in each genome annotation. the comparative analysis for enzymes and biochemical pathways was performed using pathway mapping for each genome in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database  <cit> .

RESULTS
we report here the complete genome sequence analysis of the bacterium bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> that has a potential to induce heart autoimmunity by molecular mimicry. bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> was originally isolated from ocean water at a depth of 10 m in a sea expedition seeking to study the marine microflora in the gulf of mexico and around the bimini islands. however, the possible significance of this bacterium as a pathogen was unknown  <cit> . based on our discovery that bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> contains a disease-inducing mimicry epitope for cardiac myosin, we sought to determine the biological significance of this organism to humans. to this end, we decided to sequence the complete genome of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> and characterize its phenotypic and biochemical features with the expectation that identification of its species may create opportunities to establish a new disease model to study the autoimmune events of bacterial myocarditis in experimental settings.

genome sequencing
morphologically, bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> was found to be a gram-positive, rod-shaped, sub-terminal endospore-forming, aerobic bacterium with rounded ends as observed by light microscopy . for complete genome sequencing, we isolated the genomic dna and performed sequencing in long-reads by pacbio rs smrt sequencing technology  <cit> . the sequencing produced >900 mb of post-filter sequences, consisting 176 k reads of average > <dig>  <dig> bases. initial assembly of the genome produced a circularizable contig of  <dig> , <dig> bases. the assembly was further refined in quiver to generate a final assembly of  <dig> , <dig> bases; wherein, 84 % of subreads mapped back to the assembly, resulting in consensus calling with an average base coverage of 114x. a gc skew analysis indicated that the origin of replication occurred at the  <dig> ,945th position. this position was then renumbered as position  <dig> to indicate the origin of replication. the overall gc content of the genome was estimated to be 46 %, which is relatively higher than the gc content of genomes from b. subtilis strain  <dig>  b. megaterium dsm  <dig>  b. thuringiensis serovar kurstaki strain hd <dig> and b. cereus atcc  <dig> . these bacteria were chosen for comparison because their complete genome sequences were available in the ncbi database. nonetheless, the gc content correlated positively with the percent coding region, but no other major differences were noted, except that the number of trnas and rrnas were relatively low in bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> . the genomic sequence was annotated and submitted to the ncbi .table  <dig> comparative analysis of the genome of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> with the genomes of other bacillus species

analysis of the genomic sequence of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> revealed several noteworthy features.  the bacterium was found to contain one large plasmid with a size of  <dig>  bases . the plasmid encodes several proteins, including component of the type iv secretion system .  base-modification analysis of the genome revealed two different motifs, one with methylation of adenine at the 6th position to yield n6-methyladenine  on both the dna strands, and the other on only one strand. the respective motifs are: cacnnnnnctng/cnagnnnnngtg  and ggagt . we further scanned the chromosome and plasmid sequences using pacbio software to identify the restriction and modification systems that could be responsible for methylation at the specific motifs. while the genome did not reveal any of the above, the plasmid was found to contain a type i restriction-modification system specific for m6a modification. although such modifications were suspected to have a role in pathway regulation  <cit> , the role of the type i restriction-modification system in bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> has not been determined.  the genome encoded two vancomycin and one kanamycin resistance genes; however, the vancomycin resistance genes were found to be non-functional due to frameshifting insertions.

previous efforts to assemble the bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> genome using the  <dig> sequencing technology  differed from our long-read sequencing approach  <cit> . the bioproject had sequences for a total of  <dig> contigs, consisting of  <dig> large and  <dig> small contigs . the  <dig> large contigs had coverage of  <dig> , <dig> bases, accounting for 82 % of the total genomic length . eight of them, however, showed sequencing errors/ambiguity as denoted by ‘ns’ in most places. five of the  <dig> small contigs did not match our assemblies of either chromosome or plasmid . one of these  failed to match with any of the sequences in the non-redundant nucleotide database at ncbi . eight out of the remaining  <dig> small contigs matched only partially with our plasmid sequence, with coverage of 8 % . thus, the plasmid did not seem to be identified in their data set. finally, among the remaining  <dig> small contigs, seven  matched our chromosome sequence, and the matching of another contig  was nearly perfect but fragmented in nine locations . sequences of the remaining  <dig> small contigs matched with our genomic sequence. comparison of our genome with the scaffold sequences derived in the bioproject also revealed several alterations in the orientation of the sequences. overall, the total size of the genomic sequence submitted by siefert et al. 2000  <cit>  was estimated to be  <dig> , <dig> bases,  <dig>  more bases than in our assembly . this inflated genome size may be caused by many ‘ns’ included in their sequences. the elimination of these ns makes the relative coverage of their sequences  to our genome to be  <dig>  % , suggesting that their sequencing may possibly be near completion, but the sequences were fragmented and not assembled. taken together, our sequencing approach using pacbio smrt led to complete genome assembly with no errors, as also reported by others  <cit> . however, heterogeneity within and across colonies generated from the same samples cannot be ruled out for the differences observed between the two approaches.fig.  <dig> comparison of assemblies of the bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> genome based on sequencing long-reads followed by de novo assembly as opposed to sequencing short-reads with subsequent scaffold building. coverage maps depict short-read contigs assembled by scaffolding  and short-read contigs prior to scaffolding  from a previous bioproject assembly of the bacillus sp. nrrl- <dig> genome, as aligned against our de novo assembly using long-reads. alignment of short-read scaffolds and contigs is shown in the bottom panel. red denotes 1x coverage by scaffolds, and blue denotes 1x coverage by the remaining unscaffolded contigs from the bioproject final assembly. arrows point to areas with 2x coverage by sequences in their final contig list 



identification of the species for bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> as b. infantis
to identify the species of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig>  we adopted four approaches: phylogenetic analyses of the 16s rrna gene sequences, analysis of the 16s-23s rdna its sequences, biochemical, and maldi-tof analyses.

phylogenetic analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences
to determine the species-identity of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig>  we performed phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences, a system that has been routinely used for speciating various bacteria . we compared the 16s ribosomal dna sequences of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> with those from  <dig> selected species including bacillus and four other related genera  . the phylogenetic analysis revealed that bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> formed a clade distinct from the soil-dwelling bacilli . as expected, the marine inhabitants from the genera halobacillus, oceanobacillus, geobacillus and paenibacillus formed separate clades, further validating the reliability of using 16s rrna gene sequence analysis for species identification . within the marine bacilli, bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> formed a well-supported cluster with two strains of b. infantis  as well as b. mangrovensis  indicating their close relationships . bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> was particularly close to the two strains of b. infantis suggesting a possibility that bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> is likely to be b. infantis.fig.  <dig> construction of phylogenetic tree representing the 16s rrna gene sequences derived from various bacillus species. bootstrap supporting values  are shown at the nodes only when higher than 70 %. box indicates clustering of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig>  b. infantis strain  <dig> and b. infantis strain smc 43521- <dig> together in one clade



sequence analysis of its regions
because that phylogenetic analysis suggested the probable species of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> to be b. infantis jcm 13438 t, we sought to analyze the sequences of their its regions for further analysis. the 16s-23s rdna its regions are considered to be the most variable regions of the ribosomal operon  <cit> . the sequences of these regions have been proposed to be species/strain-specific for the genus, bacillus  <cit> . therefore, we performed a comparative evaluation of the its regions of both bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> and b. infantis jcm 13438 t to determine the similarities between the two. using three sets of primers as previously described , we performed pcr analysis of genomic dna from both the microorganisms. we named the resulting six amplicons as its <dig>  its <dig>  its <dig>  its <dig>  its <dig> and its <dig>  and sequenced them. this analysis yielded the following information:  the sizes and patterns of pcr amplicons obtained from both bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> and b. infantis jcm 13438 t were similar ;  by excluding the sequences of 16s and 23s rdnas, we were able to determine the identities of five its-amplicons, its <dig>  its <dig>  its <dig>  its <dig> and its <dig>  and their sizes ranged from  <dig> to 268 bp . these sequences also matched with the its regions of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> . however, one amplicon, its <dig> did not yield its-specific information; and  comparisons of sequences of its <dig>  its <dig>  its <dig>  its <dig> and its <dig> between bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> and b. infantis jcm 13438 t revealed their identities ranged from  <dig>  to 100 % . as the cut-off value for species identification based on its sequences has been suggested to be at least 92 % and the identities of both bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> and b. infantis jcm 13438 t meet this criterion, it is likely that both strains belong to the same species.fig.  <dig> comparative analysis of 16s-23s rdna its of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> and b. infantis jcm 13438 t. the its regions of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> and b. infantis jcm 13438 t were amplified by pcr using the genomic dna as a template as described in the methods section. the pcr products were resolved in 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide



biochemical analyses
to phenotype and compare the biochemical characteristics between bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> and b. infantis jcm 13438 t, we used biolog pm  to analyze parameters, such as utilization of sugars and amino acids and other carbon sources, ability to grow at high salt concentrations, and growth in the presence of acids and antibiotics . biolog pm involves the reduction of tetrazolium compounds due to the utilization of a specific substrate in query under minimally defined nutrient conditions  <cit> . pm analysis predicted the probable species of b. infantis jcm 13438 t and bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> to be the same using inoculation protocol a, the recommended protocol for bacillus. the omnilog software determined a final identification of b. infantis with a similarity index value  of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for b. infantis jcm 13438 t and bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> respectively. the next closest matches in the omnilog database were brevibacterium otitidis for bacillus sp. nrrl b-14911; and staphylococcus equorum subsp. equorum for b. infantis jcm 13438 t with sim values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, which may not be the reliable identification for the genus bacillus. it is to be noted that the sim values are lower because of the recommend truncated incubation time used for bacillus, where the automated id software would normally incubate a protocol a 20 h or more. further, by comparing the biochemical characteristics of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> with b. infantis jcm 13438 t  <cit> , we noted that most of the parameters of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> complemented those of b. infantis jcm 13438 t . likewise, by examining metabolism in the geniii plate containing various antimicrobials, we noted that both the bacteria were likely susceptible to vancomycin, troleandomycin, lincomycin, and a few tetrazolium compounds. sensitivity to vancomycin was further confirmed with disc diffusion testing and it supports the finding of the genomic sequence analysis which also found the corresponding gene to be non-functional as described above.table  <dig> comparison of biochemical characteristics of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> with b. infantis jcm 13438 t

maldi-tof analysis
maldi-tof analysis has been widely used to discriminate bacteria at genus, species, subspecies and strain levels . maldi-tof analysis was conducted on the bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> proteome using bruker daltonik maldi biotyper. the analysis predicted the bacterium to be b. infantis after four independent analysis with scores  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> . the second closest matches in the database were b. nealsonii and b. firmus. to further validate this finding, we repeated the maldi-tof analysis using proteomes from both bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> and b. infantis jcm 13438 t. these analyses predicted both the bacteria to be b. infantis with scores ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig>  for b. infantis jcm 13438 t suggesting that their proteomic profiles are similar.

little is known about the diversity within the species of b. infantis as only a very small number of isolates have been described. as the data generated with both biochemical and maldi-tof analyses agreed with the phylogenetic analysis, but the sequence analyses of its regions revealed identities in the range of  <dig>  % to 100 %, we believe that bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> may represent strain variation within the species b. infantis. thus, we suggest the species and strain of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> as b. infantis nrrl b- <dig> 

analysis of virulence factors
the ability of bacteria to cause disease in susceptible hosts is determined largely by their virulence factors. we attempted to identify the genes from b. infantis nrrl b- <dig> that encode for various virulence factors based on the sequence similarities with virulence factor proteins found in the vfdb database. a total of  <dig> proteins from bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> were identified to be potential virulence factors. a list of these proteins and their gene locations are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> and fig.  <dig>  among these,  <dig> proteins were found to be unique to bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> when compared with those from pathogenic  and non-pathogenic bacilli  . similarly, by comparing with the pathogenic bacilli alone, we noted that  <dig> genes to be common for both bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> and the pathogenic bacilli . the notable virulence factor genes include intercellular adhesion protein, invasion-associated protein, accessory colonization factor, laminin-binding surface protein, toxin co-regulated pilus biosynthesis protein, transporters, and regulatory proteins phop/phoq.fig.  <dig> circular genome map of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> showing the location of genes for virulence factors. the map shows the locations of  <dig> genes of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> potentially encoding virulence factors. the two outer blue circles represent the genes for virulence factors shown in forward and reverse directions. the innermost circle represents the gc skewness, and the second innermost circle represents the gc content of the bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> genome. the coordinates of each gene are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the start and end positions in additional file 1: table s <dig> match with the location of genes in fig. 4




other pathways
we evaluated the genome of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> for the presence or absence of methyltransferases, transporters, enzymatic and biochemical pathways and is elements and compared the results with those from four other bacilli: b. subtilis strain  <dig>  b. megaterium dsm  <dig>  b. thuringiensis serovar kurstaki strain hd <dig> and b. cereus atcc  <dig> 

methyl transferases and transporters
in prokaryotes, dna-methylation controls a number of physiological processes, including transcription, dna mismatch repair and initiation of replication. three classes of methyltransferases have been identified in bacteria: the first two classes transfer a methyl group from s-adenosyl-l-methionine  to adenine and cytosine to yield m6a and n4-methylcytosine , respectively; and the third class transfers a methyl group from sam to cytosine to generate 5-methylcytosine   <cit> . five methyl transferases were found to be present uniquely in b. infantis nrrl b- <dig>  these include 50s rrna methyltransferase, lysine methyltransferase, n5-glutamine sam-dependent methyltransferase, protein-l-isoaspartate o-methyltransferase, and sam-dependent methyltransferase . it is reported that rrna methyltransferases confer antibiotic resistance to the bacteria by adding methyl groups specifically to the 23s rrna, and prevent binding of drugs/antibiotics to the large subunit of the ribosome  <cit> . thus, bacteria like b. infantis nrrl b- <dig> that possess 50s rrna methytransferases may have a survival advantage under antibiotic selection pressure. similarly, lysine methyltransferases are known to mediate methylation of lysine residues in ribosomal and flagellar proteins and have a role in the posttranslational modification processes  <cit> .

two main superfamilies of transporters have been identified in bacteria. these include ion-coupled transporters and the abc solute atpases, which maintain in- and out-flow of nutrients and wastes. we noted a number of transporters present in bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> . a few unique transporters include  antibiotic abc transporter atp-binding protein and arsenic transporter atpase/arsenite efflux transporter, which determine resistance to antibiotics and arsenic by extrusion  <cit> ;  c4-dicarboxylate abc transporter, a tripartite atp-independent periplasmic transporter that transports organic acids like succinate, malate fumarate, keto-acids and n-acetyl neuraminic acid  <cit> ;  corrinoid abc transporter that facilitates the intake of complex cyclic tetrapyrrole molecules such as hemes, chlorophylls and coenzyme f <dig>  <cit> ,  macrolide transporter, an efflux transporter of macrolide drugs like erythromycin and azithromycin, which determines resistance to antibiotics  <cit> ,  nicotinamide riboside transporter that aids in the uptake of nicotinamide riboside into the cytoplasm  <cit> ;  nitrate abc transporter that mediates uptake of nitrate into the cell  <cit> ;  peptide abc transporter, which is often present in firmicutes, that determines resistance to antimicrobial peptides by substrate extrusion from the cell  <cit> ; and  riboflavin transporter fmnp, which is involved in the uptake of riboflavin into the cell and a frequently occurring transporter in firmicutes  <cit> .

enzymes and biochemical pathways
as described above, bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> contains a mimicry epitope  for cardiac myosin peptide  , with allantoate amidohydrolase  as the source protein  <cit> . as expected, the annotated gene sequence of aah also contains the exact amino acid sequence of the mimicry epitope as indicated above . to further confirm whether b. infantis jcm 13438 t also contains the gene for aah, and if so, whether the sequence for mimicry epitope bac 25- <dig> is conserved, we amplified the aah gene from both bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> and b. infantis jcm 13438 t using the genomic dna as a template, and sequenced the pcr products. these analyses revealed the presence of aah gene in b. infantis jcm 13438 t , and the amino acid sequence of the mimicry epitope, bac 25- <dig> was also conserved except one silent mutation . previously, we had reported the conservation of the mimicry epitope, bac 25- <dig> in various other bacillus species  <cit> . functionally, the biochemical reaction carried out by aah is a two-step conversion of allantoate to ureidoglycolate and ammonia  <cit> , and aah functionality has been detected in both plants and bacteria. it is possible that the aah gene may have been laterally transferred between plants and bacteria for recycling nitrogen  <cit> . we also noted that b. infantis nrrl b- <dig> is capable of biosynthesizing lps and steroids . additionally, as reported by others  <cit> , our sequence analysis revealed the presence of a novel class of extracellular poly   depolymerase. this enzyme is required for degradation of phb to produce 3-hydroxybutyrate as an intracellular carbon and energy source under conditions of limited or unbalanced nutrient-availability  <cit> . we speculate that the phb depolymerase may be critical for bacterial survival in the environment.fig.  <dig> conservation of aah gene in bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> and b. infantis jcm 13438 t. aah gene was amplified from bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> and b. infantis jcm 13438 t using genomic dna as a template by pcr. the pcr amplicons were resolved in 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide



is elements
the is elements are recombinationally active, mobile, genetic segments of bacterial dna  that move from one position to another within the same chromosome or to a different chromosome. one consequence could be inactivation of gene expression if the insertion of is elements takes place within the coding sequence  <cit> . we noted that is <dig>  is1380/is <dig>  is5/is <dig> and tn <dig> are uniquely present in the genome of b. infantis nrrl b- <dig>  compared to other bacilli. previously, it was demonstrated that the transposon tn <dig>  carries the enzyme β-lactamase, in addition to transposase and resolvase, and confers resistance to β-lactam antibiotics  <cit> . whether the tn <dig> present in b. infantis nrrl b- <dig> perform similar functions requires additional studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have described the complete genome sequence analysis of a marine microbe called bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig>  the bacterial genome sequence analysis allowed us to identify genes for a wide range of virulence factors and enzymatic and biochemical pathways, including is elements that are distinct from other closely related bacilli. the availability of the complete genomic sequence of bacillus sp. nrrl b- <dig> may thus provide opportunities to genetically manipulate its genome to study the genes in bacterial survival and virulence. furthermore, phylogenetic and 16s-23s rdna its sequence analyses including biochemical and phenotypic characterizations suggested a close-association with b. infantis, and as such, we have proposed the species and strain of bacillus nrrl b- <dig> as b. infantis nrrl b- <dig>  of note, b. infantis was previously identified as one of the six bacterial isolates from a newborn child with sepsis, but its pathological significance was unknown  <cit> . similarly, a variety of pathogens have been implicated in the causation of heart autoimmunity, but their direct causal links remain tenous clinically. thus, it becomes difficult to explain the persistent inflammation in the absence of detectable infectious particles. in these circumstances, autoimmunity is suspected with a challenge being able to prove the cause and effect relationship. mechanistically, break in self-tolerance as a result of exposure to microbes carrying mimicry epitopes for self-antigens like cardiac myosin can lead to heart autoimmunity through the generation of cross-reactive t cells as we have demonstrated for bac 25- <dig> present in bacillus spp. nrrl b- <dig> . this bacterium, may thus serve as a useful tool to establish a disease model that permits systematic analysis of autoimmune events with respect to the appearance, disappearance, persistence, and/or reappearance of cross-reactive t cells and their functionalities experimentally in susceptible rodent strains.
