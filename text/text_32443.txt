BACKGROUND
the advent of whole genome sequencing has drastically altered our perspective on life's evolutionary history. bacterial genomes are now known to be largely mosaics made up of horizontally transferred genes  <cit> . in fact, many bacteria that cause disease, like those that cause plague, meningitis, tetanus or cholera have only become virulent after they acquired virulence genes  <cit> , highlighting the impact of horizontal gene transfer on human health  <cit> . in many cases, questions remain about the natural reservoir of these acquired genes  <cit> .

these horizontally transferred genes are not necessarily acquired one at a time. numerous bacterial genomes show clusters of recently acquired genes that are known as genomic islands   <cit> . even though many gis have unknown functions, some of these acquired gene clusters are involved in pathogenicity , though several other clustered collective functions are known   <cit> . we hypothesise that, when several gis reside in a single genome, it is possible that a single donor has been responsible for multiple gene transfer events to that host.

in a previous study, we found that compositionally similar sequences can be clustered together, and a genomic acquisition account of large acquired gene clusters can be established  <cit> . such alignment-free compositional analyses focus on the similarity between two sequences with respect to their relative dinucleotide frequencies. in brief, relative dinucleotide frequencies are known to be typical for a given genome, a genomic signature, and similar between related species. this parameter can be used to assess the similarity in composition between different sequences, for example in binning sequences that are thought to be derived from the same organism  <cit> . compositional analyses have been used before to detect compositionally anomalous genes  <cit> , which could subsequently be identified as putative horizontally acquired genes. in addition, similar comparative analyses have been applied to metagenomic datasets, in which genomic fragments were assigned to their probable host based on their compositional similarities  <cit> . however, few attempts have been made to compositionally compare clusters of acquired genes, in order to indicate common donors, analogous to assigning donors to sequences from metagenomic libraries.

here we focus on the acquisition accounts of gis that are identified in the genomes of a large collection of bacterial and archaeal species  <cit> . by comparing the compositional similarities of all gis that reside in the same genome, for a large number of genomes, conservative estimates of the maximum number of compositionally distinct donors can be assessed. this will shed new light onto the evolutionary histories of prokaryotes, and the quantitative dynamics of recurrent horizontal gene transfer events of large gene clusters.

methods
analyses were carried out as described previously  <cit> , with a few modifications for scaling up the analyses. in brief, gis were obtained from islandviewer  <cit>  at http://www.pathogenomics.sfu.ca/islandviewer/download.php, selecting only those species/genera having genome sizes >  <dig> kb and the gis with sizes >  <dig> kb. smaller genomes are thought to be mostly devoid of gis since they often represent intracellular symbionts, whereas the  <dig> kb cut-off is based on previous publications concerning sizes of gis  <cit> . islandviewer is a computational tool that integrates different genomic island prediction software suits; two sequence composition prediction methods  and a comparative gi prediction method . regions that are identified with islandviewer are annotated as putative genomic islands, and included in our gi set  <cit> . this database may not cover all large acquired gene clusters, but does allow for large-scale compositional analyses.

with this collection of gis, the compositional relatedness of each gi was subsequently compared with its respective genome. this was done by comparing the composition of the gi, with the compositions of all genomic fragments of the same size  <cit> . next, all gis residing in the same genome were compared with each other by calculating the average dinucleotide relative abundance difference, or genomic dissimilarity   <cit> , after which we cluster all compositionally similar gis per genome, based on their genomic dissimilarity values using δρ-web and compare_islands  <cit> , respectively. more information on these methods can be found at the website http://deltarho.amc.nl. in brief, distance matrices of gi comparisons per genome revealed the gis that have a lower genomic dissimilarity than a conservative threshold sequence to its host genome. with respect to these conservative thresholds of relatedness, we included in each comparison a chromosomal fragment of  <dig> kb with a very low relative dissimilarity with its genome. the relative dissimilarity signifies the dissimilarity between a query sequence and the rest of the genome; the dissimilarity of the query is relative to the collection of non-overlapping genomic fragments of identical size as the query. the relative dissimilarity is expressed as a percentage of genomic fragments with a lower genomic dissimilarity than the query sequence. a relative dissimilarity of 95% signifies that 95% of all non-overlapping genomic fragments of identical size as the query is more similar to the genome than the query is. the threshold sequences are based on progressively lower relative dissimilarity values. core islands ci- <dig>  ci- <dig>  ci- <dig> and ci- <dig> represent the four threshold sequences with relative dissimilarity values of 25%, 10%, 5% and 0%. in other words, a core island from a specific genome is compositionally very similar to its host. in order to test that different gis from the same genome originate from a same donor species, the gis need to be compositionally more similar to each other than the core island is to its host genome. thus, if gis meet these similarity thresholds, we score these gis as clusters that have a compositionally similar background, and therefore likely a common origin. in some instances, compositionally similar gis are not clustered together due to a high compositional similarity between a gi from a predicted cluster with a gi outside of that specific cluster. the similarity threshold between the unclustered gi and one of the other gis in the cluster is not met. these problems in an unambiguous interpretation of the clustering are categorized as 'conflicts', and subsequently all gis from that genome are excluded from the cluster analyses in order to reduce potential misclassifications. an example of an analysis with a clustering conflict is given in additional file  <dig>  which gives the compositional distance matrix of six gis from the genome of clostridium botulinum ba4_ <dig> , relative to the ci- <dig> threshold sequence. these conflicts are removed from the analyses in an attempt to obtain a conservative dataset with few ambiguities.

a set of stand-alone scripts is available from the authors , with both instructions on how to perform the analyses for gi sets automatically as well as the raw data for the analyses presented here. it iterates all calculations for each applicable gi-host and gi-gi combination within a host, allowing the user to choose different cut-off values of compositional dissimilarity , as well as gi size. for individual gi/genome comparisons, compare_islands can be used at http://deltarho.amc.nl  <cit> .

in order to test to test the accuracy of our clustering approach and cut-offs, we simulate a clustering fidelity by analyzing how frequently fragments from the same genome are clustered together when a pool of phylogenetically unrelated  <dig> kb sequences are compared. for each of the four thresholds,  <dig> analyses are carried out, each consisting of a set of  <dig> sequences;  <dig> originating from distinct genera, and ten non-biological randomized sequences. the  <dig> sequences originate from  <dig> genomes, with three fragments per genome, and two out of these three have a relative dissimilarity like the threshold that is being simulated. the third sequence has a relative dissimilarity of 50% with its host genome. in this simulation, the accuracy of the clustering is expressed as a percentage, which indicates how often the threshold sequences are clustered with sequences from the same host genome.

RESULTS
first, we extracted all genomic islands from islandviewer , amounting to a total of  <dig> sequences between  <dig>  and  <dig> kb in size, originating from  <dig> distinct genomes. after applying the conservative criteria discussed in the material and methods section , we maintained  <dig> gis  that vary in size from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb . these gis are present in  <dig> genome sequences, which represent  <dig> species in  <dig> genera . this means on average  <dig> gis per genome, varying from  <dig>  to  <dig>  gis per genome . these  <dig> gis, using the compositional threshold of ci- <dig>  were used in our subsequent investigations, unless noted otherwise.

second, we analyzed the composition dissimilarities of these gis with their respective host chromosomes similar to previous analyses on comparisons between plasmids and host chromosomes  <cit> . of the  <dig> gis,  <dig>  are compositionally anomalous compared to their host genome . of these  <dig> gis, a large number  have a very low gc content compared to fragments of identical length from their respective host genomes . out of the  <dig> gis, only  <dig> gis  have a lower genomic dissimilarity with the host genome than with the threshold sequence ci- <dig>  meaning that these gis are compositionally extremely similar to their respective host genomes .

third, we tested all gis per genome for their compositional dissimilarity. in  <dig> genomes  we identify  <dig> clusters, including a total of  <dig> gis . the number of clustered gis per genome varies between the minimal  <dig> gis in a single cluster , to  <dig> gis in a total of  <dig> clusters . the only clusters that contain three gis occur in three genomes bradyrhizobium ors <dig>  escherichia coli o157h <dig> strain sakai and rhodobacter sphaeroides atcc  <dig>  in bradyrhizobium ors <dig>  the three gis that are clustered together show a high compositional similarity to the host genome sequence. two of these in fact belong to the  <dig> gis that are compositionally very similar to their respective genomes, and therefore these two gis are unlikely to represent horizontal transfer events. for e. coli o157h <dig> strain sakai and r. sphaeroides atcc  <dig>  we tested whether the three clustered gis are more similar than a set of five sequences belong to the 10% most compositionally similar sequences of the genome . we find that for both e. coli o157h <dig> strain sakai and r. sphaeroides atcc  <dig>  the gis that are clustered together in threes, are on average equally or more similar to each other than the five sequences that represent the conservative genome signature .

in genomes with multiple chromosomes, we test for gis that are compositionally very similar to each other, yet reside on a different replicon. out of  <dig> gis identified in this set of genomes,  <dig> gis are assigned to a total of  <dig> clusters . out of these  <dig> gis, ten , all of them in burkholderia genomes, are not located on the same chromosome.

when relaxing the similarity threshold by using the genome signature difference between the core island  <dig>  and the genome, we observe only  <dig> gis in a total of  <dig> genome sequences that meet our criteria. with this more lenient threshold, a total of  <dig> gis are now compositionally more similar to the host genome than the cut-off sequence ci- <dig> is to the genome. a total of  <dig> gis  are now grouped together in  <dig> clusters, with  <dig> clusters containing three gis.

in contrast, when making the composition similarity threshold substantially more conservative , we find  <dig> gis in a total of  <dig> genome sequences. only  <dig> gis are now compositionally more similar to the host genome when compared to the cut-off sequence ci- <dig>  still, there are  <dig> clusters containing  <dig> gis , which show very high compositional similarity within each cluster . finally, using threshold ci- <dig>  in which gis need to be compositionally more similar to each other than the genomic fragment that has a nearly identical dinucleotide composition as the host genome, we find only  <dig> gis that form  <dig> clusters. these  <dig> gis represent only  <dig> % of the total number of gis included in this analysis.

the totals represent the total numbers in the original data set from islandviewer.

*) the percentage of clustered gis  excludes  <dig> gis from the total number of gis , since there are  <dig> genomes with a single gi only, and with less than two gis there can be no clustering.

**) six out of  <dig> clusters contain in fact largely identical genomic islands, which explains their high compositional similarity.

finally, in order to validate the accuracy of the clustered gis per threshold, we simulated cluster assignments by comparing sets of  <dig>  <dig> kb fragments from random prokaryotic genomes for their compositionally most similar fragment. each set of  <dig> fragments consists of three fragments per species, for  <dig> species of distinct genera, and includes  <dig> random synthetic sequences with no biological significance. for each threshold, the simulation was carried out  <dig> times. accuracy is expressed as the percentage in which a sequence is found to be most similar to another sequence from the same genome. these values are used as proxies for the correct assignment of a sequence from the same genome, and range from  <dig> % accurate for the strictest threshold of ci- <dig>  to  <dig> % accurate for the ci- <dig> threshold .

discussion
by comparing genomic islands from  <dig> bacterial and archaeal chromosomes, we explore the dynamics of the genome-specific acquisition accounts on a large scale. these analyses show us that in numerous cases, distinct gis in particular genomes are remarkably similar in composition. this leads us to speculate that, using a conservative similarity cut-off, in  <dig> % of the cases, multiple acquisition events of gis have taken place from a donor with a very similar base composition as the acceptor.

for this goal, we developed a suite of scripts that allows users to customize these analyses by modifying the minimal gi length, or the similarity cut-off sequence . by increasing the stringency to the very conservative ci- <dig>  which means that gis need to be more similar to each other in composition than 95% of the genomic fragments, we still find that 10% of the tested gis can be grouped together to a total of  <dig> gi clusters. however, we investigate the accuracy of our assessments by simulating the clustering efficiency in a randomized sample of sequences with different thresholds. we find that the prediction accuracy according to this simulation is >  <dig> % even for the least conservative compositional threshold . this gives credibility to our findings of substantial recurrent transfer events from the same donor to the same host. in bradyrhizobium ors <dig>  we find a cluster containing three gis, two of which cannot be considered compositionally dissimilar from the genome. in this case, these gis may have been residing for a substantial amount of time in the genome, and have ameliorated to the host's genome composition  <cit> .

this approach does not discriminate between separate introgressions of multiple compositionally very similar sequences from a common donor, and the post-acquisition intragenomic dispersal of a large genomic island. technically, this is of little importance, since in both cases the host of the distinct gis would be a similar donor. with respect to compositionally similar gis that reside on separate chromosomes, we find that that incoming gis seem to be indiscriminate between the replicon it integrates in, or that subsequent dispersal throughout the genome can result in a move to a different replicon.

the association of gis with virulence factors  <cit>  emphasize the significant role of acquired gene clusters in the evolution of numerous pathogens. investigations into the repetitive acquisition of gis from a common source may help identifying potential donors of these sequences through for example the association with species-specific sequence motifs such as dna uptake sequences  <cit> . also, a common origin of compositionally similar clusters may result in common regulatory modules, interactions or mobilizing capacities. for example, a study into small regulatory rnas  on genomic islands in salmonella typhimurium revealed that srnas mainly affect the expression of flanking genes  <cit> . if genomic islands disperse throughout the genome, our analysis would facilitate the identification of potential associated regulatory targets that are no longer adjacent.

unfortunately, the forces that shape the genome signatures of prokaryotes are still unknown. it has been speculated that they could include species-specific properties such as dna modifications, replication and repair mechanisms  <cit> , though recently statistical support has been found for an environmental influence on the oligonucleotide compositions  <cit> , which could mean that a similar environment could also cause similarities in genome signature. for compositional comparisons such as described here, it is of interest to understand what conditions shape the composition of dna to which extent, in order to pinpoint potential pitfalls in grouping genomic islands.

CONCLUSIONS
even when lacking sequence alignments, numerous large acquired gene clusters in sequenced genomes can be associated with each other individually via substantial compositional similarities. our analysis suggests, backed up by simulations, that in many cases recurring horizontal gene transfer events have taken place between a donor and acceptor organism. these analyses do not only quantify these events, but also enable further investigations into the origin of these genomic islands, and even help analyzing possible interactions between related sequences.
