BACKGROUND
hepatocytes are polarized epithelial cells that possess well defined apical  and basolateral  plasma membrane domains. bile secretion involves the movement of water across hepatocyte plasma membrane domains in response to transient osmotic gradients generated by active solute transport into the canalicular space of bile acids, glutathione and bicarbonate  <cit> . the main canalicular solute transporters are the bile salt export pump bsep, the organic anion transporter mrp <dig> and the chloride bicarbonate exchanger ae <dig>  <cit> .

we and others recently reported that hepatocytes express aquaporin  water channels  <cit> , a family of integral membrane proteins that increase cell membrane water permeability facilitating passive osmotically driven water movement  <cit> . in hepatocytes, the water channels aquaporin- <dig>  and aquaporin- <dig>  are primarily located within the cell in a vesicular compartment, and aqp <dig> redistributes to the canalicular membrane under a choleretic stimulus  <cit> . aqp <dig> it was recently described also localized in mitochondria  <cit> . aquaporin- <dig>  is found principally on the basolateral membrane  <cit> . our previous studies suggest that water channels play an important role in the transcellular transport of water during primary bile secretion by hepatocytes  <cit> .

unfortunately, the bile formation process is difficult to study in vitro. in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, downregulation of both basolateral and canalicular solute transporters occurs  <cit>  and bile acid uptake gradually decreases and disappears after  <dig> to  <dig> days  <cit> . moreover, in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes, canalicular bile acid secretion appears limited  <cit> . in addition, the vectorial transport of solutes is lost in many hepatoma cell lines such as hepg <dig>  <cit> , htc  <cit> , and fao  <cit> .

the wif-b cell line is a highly differentiated and polarized rat hepatoma/human fibroblast hybrid, which forms bile canaliculi-like structures  <cit> . this cell line has been shown to be a good model for studying hepatocyte polarity  <cit> , protein secretion  <cit> , bile acid transport  <cit>  and protein transport  <cit> . furthermore, wif-b cells express the basolateral na+-taurocholate cotransporter, ntcp  <cit>  and the canalicular conjugate export pump, mrp <dig>  <cit> .

to further explore the usefulness of the wif-b cell line as an in vitro model for regulatory and mechanistic studies of bile secretion biology, we investigated the presence and localization of aquaporins and the principal solute transporters involved in canalicular bile formation.

RESULTS
expression of aquaporins and canalicular solute transporters in wif-b cells by rt-pcr
rt-pcr was run for each of the three aqps and the three solute transporters on total rna derived from wif-b cells. cdna from freshly isolated rat hepatocytes was used as positive control. as shown in figure  <dig>  wif-b cells express mrna of rat aqp <dig>  aqp <dig> and aqp <dig>  and ae <dig>  mrp <dig> and bsep . the pcr products were sequenced and the identities of the amplicons, verified by data base homology searches , were consistent with the predicted rat genes.

expression of aquaporins and canalicular solute transporters in wif-b cells by immunoblotting
as shown in figure 2a, wif-b cells express aqp <dig>  aqp <dig>  and aqp <dig> proteins. wif-b plasma and intracellular membranes, as well as hepatocyte homogenates showed a  <dig> kda band on the immunoblotting for aqp <dig>  the immunoblot for aqp <dig> shows the presence of a  <dig> kda band on wif-b plasma and intracellular membranes. aqp <dig> is also positive in the plasma membrane fraction of wif-b cells, showing the  <dig> kda band. figure 2b shows the immunoblotting for the three solute transporters: ae <dig>  and bsep  are present on the plasma membrane of wif-b and, as described  <cit> , mrp <dig>  is also present in the cell line.

confocal immunofluorescence
immunofluorescent staining of wif-b cells further confirmed the expression of the three aqps . the subcellular localization is similar to that of rat hepatocytes, i.e. aqp <dig> mainly intracellular, aqp <dig> mostly in intracellular vesicular structures throughout the cytosol and aqp <dig> on the basolateral membrane. the immunofluorescence for ae <dig>  bsep and mrp <dig> showed pericanalicular localization . immunofluorescent costaining was performed for aqp <dig> and ae <dig>  these molecules showed colocalization , suggesting the presence of a population of pericanalicular vesicles containing both aqp <dig> and ae <dig> 

discussion
the major finding reported here relate to the expression and subcellular localization of aquaporin water channels in the wif-b cell line. using rt-pcr, immunoblotting and confocal immunofluorescence we showed that  wif-b cells express the aquaporin water channels that facilitate the osmotically driven water movements, i.e. aqp <dig>  aqp <dig>  and aqp0; as well as the key solute transporters involved in the generation of the canalicular osmotic gradients, i.e., the bile salt export pump bsep, the organic anion transporter mrp <dig> and the chloride bicarbonate exchanger ae <dig>   the subcellular localization of the aqps and the solute transporters in wif-b cells was similar to that in rat isolated hepatocytes and in whole liver.  immunofluorescent costaining studies showed intracellular colocalization of aqp <dig> and ae <dig>  suggesting the possibility that these transporters are expressed in the same population of pericanalicular vesicles.

hepatocyte bile secretion is formed by passive movement of water from plasma to the bile canaliculus in response to osmotic gradients established by the active secretion of solutes. the biliary excretion of bile salts, via the bile salt transporter bsep, glutathione, via the organic anion transporter mrp <dig>  and hco3-, via the cl-/hco3- exchanger ae <dig>  are thought to be the major osmotic driving forces for canalicular bile flow  <cit> . conceptually, the generation of bile flow is ultimately dependent on the molecular and functional expression of these transporters on the canalicular plasma membrane domain. aqps are present in hepatocytes at both apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains as well as in intracellular vesicle compartments. two of these aqps can account for the water permeability of both hepatocyte plasma membrane domains, aqp <dig> modulating mainly the canalicular transport of water, and aqp <dig> facilitating its basolateral movement  <cit> .

in order to further characterize the role of aquaporins in bile secretion, an in vitro cell system with retained polarity and expression of aqps and the main solute transporters involved in bile formation is highly desirable. the present work shows that wif-b cells meet these criteria, i.e. express the key solute transporters involved in the osmotic gradient generation  and the channels that facilitates plasma membrane water movement .

the wif-b hybrid cell line stably retains all rat chromosomes, and only a dozen of human chromosomes  <cit> . the aqp <dig>  ae <dig>  bsep, and mrp <dig> genes have been mapped on the human chromosomes  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit> , and  <dig>  <cit> , respectively, which are not retained by the wif line  <cit> . furthermore, it was described that wif-b cells express only the rat homolog of the bile salt transporter ntcp  <cit> , consistent with the absence of human chromosome  <dig>  on which ntcp has been mapped  <cit> . therefore, the aqp <dig>  ae <dig>  bsep, and mrp <dig> expressed by these cells should be the rat genes. by contrast, the aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> genes are located on human chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> , which are present in wif cells  <cit> . thus, wif-b cells may also express human aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> 

the subcellular localization of the aqps in wif-b cells is similar to that found in isolated hepatocytes and liver from rat. aqp <dig> was found mainly intracellular and aqp <dig> exclusively on basolateral membranes. aqp <dig> showed mostly an intracellular vesicular structures localization, which could be of potential interest for further studies on the mechanisms involved in the hormone-regulated trafficking of aqp <dig> to the canalicular plasma membrane domain  <cit> .

the canalicular/pericanalicular localization of the solute transporters is consistent with that described for rat liver or isolated hepatocytes. ae <dig> has been localized to the canalicular membrane domain  <cit> . nevertheless, the canalicular activity of ae <dig> is increased in response to stimulation with cyclic amp, and this increased activity can be blocked with colchicine, suggesting the microtubule-dependent targeting of pericanalicular vesicles containing this exchanger to the canalicular domain  <cit> . rat liver bsep is responsible for the biliary excretion of bile acids and therefore is key to the elaboration of canalicular bile  <cit> . immunogold electron microscopy detection of bsep revealed that the distribution of bsep in rat hepatocytes is not restricted to the canalicular membrane, but also detected in vesicles close to the bile canaliculus  <cit> . pericanalicular distribution of bsep was also demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining of isolated rat hepatocyte couplets  <cit> . we found that mrp <dig>  responsible for the transport into bile of a variety of amphiphilic organic anions  <cit> , is mainly localized on pericanalicular vesicles. this observation does not fully agree with a previous work showing an exclusively canalicular membrane localization of mrp <dig> in wif-b cells  <cit> . the fact that mrp <dig> showed a different localization in our hands could be explained by different culture conditions. furthermore, immunogold electron microscopy detection of mrp <dig> in rat liver revealed that over 50% of mrp <dig> resides in intracellular vesicles close to the canalicular membrane  <cit> ; and pericanalicular vesicular distribution was demonstrated by confocal immunofluorescence in isolated rat hepatocyte couplets  <cit> . this pericanalicular localization gives rise to the possibility of studying transport trafficking to the apical membrane.

it is known that the hormone glucagon stimulates bile secretion  <cit> . as we previously described, glucagon is able to increase the osmotic water permeability of hepatocytes by triggering the translocation of aqp <dig> vesicles to the plasma membrane, specifically to the canalicular domain  <cit> . although the actual osmotic gradients involved in glucagon-induced choleresis are unknown, these transient gradients are most likely created by the facilitated transport of hco3- via the canalicular cl-/hco3- exchanger ae <dig>  <cit> . there is evidence to suggest that glucagon is also able to stimulate the vesicle trafficking of ae <dig> to the hepatocyte plasma membranes  <cit> . since the immunofluorescence for aqp <dig> and ae <dig> showed colocalization, is attractive to speculate that the solute transporter and the water channel could be packaged in the same population of vesicles conforming a bile secretory unit as has been observed for aqp <dig>  ae <dig> and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator cl- channels in cholangiocytes  <cit> . thus, the existence of a novel transporting organelle containing functionally related proteins, that can account for solute-driven water transport, could be proposed in hepatocytes. this organelle could contain flux proteins playing integral roles in hormone-induced bile secretion.

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides the first evidence of a hepatocyte cell line that retains the expression and subcellular localization of aquaporin water channels, as well as key solute transporters for canalicular bile formation, turning these cells into a valuable tool for regulatory and mechanistic studies of the bile formation biology.
