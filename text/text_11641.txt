BACKGROUND
throughout the last decade, much research was devoted to unearth the functionality of micrornas , which are small , non-coding rnas regulating mrna stability and translation through the action of the rna-induced silencing complex   <cit> . earlier investigations  <cit>  have discovered that mirnas regulate a variety of key biological functions that includes insulin secretion, apoptosis, cell proliferation and differentiation, etc. more importantly, recent beliefs hypothesize that mirnas are indirectly responsible, due to disorders in functionality, for a number of diseases as they can dysregulate post-transcriptional gene expression  <cit> . emerging evidences suggest that mirnas regulate brain development, dendritic spine morphology, and neurite outgrowth, i.e., certain processes that are hypothesized to be associated with schizophrenia neuropathology. moreover, they also have influencing activities in regulating the diseases like tourette's syndrome, fragile × syndrome  <cit> , several varieties of cancers  <cit>  and many others  <cit> .

microarray profiling is a high-throughput experimentation that can be used to study the expressibility/repressibility measure of thousands of genes in parallel  <cit> . in the recent past, microarray data has been studied extensively for gene expression analysis leading to many methodological works. but the field of analyzing mirna microarrays is not well-explored. the expression profiles of mirnas derived from microarray experiments are most of the times tissue-specific in nature. in addition, mirnas are sometimes taken for expression profiling from common tissues  of different patients for the purpose of disease diagnosis. not surprisingly, due to the short length of mirnas, the purity, variance and dimension of the microarray datasets of mirnas are smaller than those of the genes. thus, developing efficient methods that could shed light into the underlying biological activity of mirnas is imperative, without depending on the methods developed for gene expression data  <cit> .

a natural approach in microarray study is mapping the simultaneous overexpression/underexpression of mirna pairs into a co-expression network. these co-expression networks are analyzed to study the functional enrichment and regulatory activities of mirnas  <cit> . however, the most important  target remains in preparing the blueprint of the complex regulatory network that hypothetically exists between transcription factors , genes and mirnas. some of the earlier studies advocated that the mirnas targeting the same gene together with a tf might be regulated by the same tf  <cit> . by exercising on the established knowledge in transfac database and microrna registry, an earlier study was done on tf and mirna regulation relating to prostate cancer cells  <cit> . a recent study pursues the same hypothesis adding that there are tf-mirna pairs that participate in a complex recurring network and exert regulatory effects on each other  <cit> . but, these previous analyzes either follow supervised learning based on the established results available in the databases like targetscan  <cit>  and pictar  <cit>  or lack exhaustive empirical study. there exists an impressive number of works on clustering mirna co-expression networks with various motivations like identification of the set of mirnas derived from common primary transcripts  <cit> , co-expression analysis between neighboring mirnas  <cit> , study of diseases  <cit> , co-expression analysis of mirna with mrna  <cit> , etc. again, these approaches do not target the construction of tf-mirna regulatory networks. moreover, they employ clustering tools commonly used for gene expression analysis though, as mentioned earlier, the scalability and the other characteristics of mirna expression data are somewhat different.

this paper introduces a novel unsupervised mining method that can heuristically self-prune a co-expression network constructed from mirna profiled microarray data. the iterative mining methodology produces a set of priority modules  from the dataset. the statistical  significance of the pms decreases as they are generated by stepwise reduction. the results show that the transcription factor binding sites  of the grouped mirnas in the 5' untranscribed region  have large common portions establishing the existence of commonly regulating tfs. in a recent work having similar goal, clustering of mirnas was done based on their commonalties in loci  <cit> . evidently, their defined putative upstream region  will contain a large number of common tfs for the clustered mirnas. this was a kind of supervised approach, and from this viewpoint the mining process discussed here is a novel one of its kind. a schizophrenia patient-specific, a tissue-specific and a stem cell-based microarray dataset are comprehensively analyzed. the studies show that these datasets are useful to explore common tfs which might regulate a module of mirnas. such tf-mirna regulation information might in turn accelerate the reconstruction of tf-mirna regulatory networks.

a network  is often defined by the triplet , where n denotes a finite set of nodes {n <dig>  n <dig> ..., n|n|} ,  denotes a set of edges between the node pairs, and w: a → [ <dig>  ∞) is a weight function associated with the edges. here, a network,  = , is referred to as an mirna co-expression network if the node set  corresponds to a set of mirnas and w : a →  <cit>  denotes a co-expression function mapped from each mirna pair in a.

in general, mirna co-expression networks can be thought of as fuzzy complete graphs  <cit>  by excluding the arcs having a co-expression value of zero. this transformation occurs by the mapping of mirnas to the vertices and co-expression values to the fuzzy membership values. thus a module identified in a fuzzy complete graph will evidently denote a set of mirnas by such transformation. a recent study proposes an o algorithm for identifying the largest dense n-vertexlet , in a fuzzy scale-free graph  <cit> . the mirna co-expression networks, being of this nature, could be mined step by step using a similar approach. for describing the proposed mining process that integrates this earlier work  <cit> , the following theoretical details are given.

definition  <dig>  a fuzzy complete graph ,  = , is defined as a graph in which v denotes the set of vertices,  denotes the set of fuzzy relations   and Ω is a fuzzy membership function defined over the set  such that Ω:  →  given an fcg,  = , the association density,  of a vertex vi of  is defined, with respect to a set of vertices  , as the ratio of the sum of the fuzzy edge memberships between vi and each of the vertices belonging to  and n. thus, the association density of a vertex vi with respect to  is computed as,

   

in eqn. ,  denotes the fuzzy membership value of the edge . this density definition computes the degree of participation of a single vertex with respect to a set of vertices. by putting the constraint of a lower bound to this density factor for every vertex within a group of vertices, the association density of an n-vertexlet is now defined as follows.

definition  <dig>  the association density of an n-vertexlet  is defined to be the minimum of the association density of every vertex belonging to the n-vertexlet with respect to the remaining -vertexlet. so, the association density of an n-vertexlet  is given by,

   

suppose, an arbitrary association density value δ is given. if the association density of an n-vertexlet, , equals or exceeds δ, then  is called a dense n-vertexlet with respect to δ and is denoted as . the proposed method derives a set of modules comprising a set of vertices  which are equivalent to such dense n-vertexlets. thus, the proposed method mines an fcg for identifying the dense n-vertexlets which are equivalent to finding modules in an mirna co-expression network. let an arbitrary fcg induced by the node set n', in an fcg  = , be denoted as , where  and Ωn' are the edge set and the fuzzy membership function induced by the node set n' in  and Ω respectively. then, a set of pms in this fcg is defined as follows.

definition  <dig>  given an fcg,  = , mapped from an mirna co-expression network, a set of k priority modules  {} () is defined such that,

 <dig>  ,

 <dig>  ,

 <dig>  .

the basic goal of this work is determining a significant set of pms from the mirna microarray profiled data for the unsupervised analysis of the tf-mirna regulation.

RESULTS
the experimentation has been carried out on three separate fcgs derived from a schizophrenia patient-specific microarray dataset  <cit> , one tissue-specific microarray dataset  <cit>  and another stem cell dataset  <cit>  . due to the noisy nature of microarray experiments, often microarray expression profiling contains missing values. here, we use the bayesian principal component analysis , which is a good one according to a recent study  <cit> , for the imputation of missing values present only in the tissue-specific dataset. then, the fcgs have been constructed by computing the fuzzy membership values ) between every mirna pair. these fcgs can be equivalently considered as co-expression networks to be explored. the histogram of the average fuzzy membership values of the mirnas with respect to others  computed in the case of all three fcgs are shown in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in all these histograms, the distribution of the number of mirnas follow a long tail with the decrease in fuzzy membership values. they also indicate that only a small fragment of the mirnas is statistically significant, within which the mean of the fuzzy membership shows higher value and nominal variance.

again, the fuzzy membership values of the mirnas, over all the tissues/patients, are computed for these datasets. these fuzzy membership values of the mirnas for all the experiments, in the form of a histogram , reflect that a large number of mirna pairs are highly co-expressed. the distributions of the mirna sizes reflected in these histograms against the fuzzy membership values help to select the lower density threshold  and the density decay constant  employed by the proposed method. by studying the histograms, we selected δlower =  <dig>  and ξ =  <dig>   for the schizophrenia dataset, δlower =  <dig>  and ξ =  <dig>   for the tissue-specific dataset, and δlower =  <dig>  and ξ =  <dig>   for the stem cell dataset.

after tuning the controlling parameters of the algorithm, we now mine these fcgs  using the self-pruning method described in the algorithm provided in table  <dig>  the post-processing routine is iterated for  <dig> times. the module sizes found by the algorithm from all the three datasets are evenly distributed without containing tiny mirna modules . the degraded density values derived at each time step along with the sizes of the pms found from all the datasets are shown in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  it may be noted that the consecutive pms generated by the algorithm will be in a decreasing order of statistical significance. thus, the intra-cluster homogeneity  <cit>  should be higher, or in effect the squared error  should be smaller, for the pms generated earlier. the se value of any arbitrary pm, c, is computed as,

the pms obtained by applying the mining method over the schizophrenia dataset. the values of δt and sic/v are rounded off upto  <dig> decimal places.

the pms obtained by applying the mining method over the tissue-specific dataset. the values of δt and sic/v are rounded off upto  <dig> decimal places.

the pms obtained by applying the mining method over the stem cell dataset. the values of δt and sic/v are rounded off upto  <dig> decimal places.

   

obviously, the value of se ranges within [ <dig>  ∞). higher the se value, lower is the compactness of the pm. again, the squared error of a solution with k modules  is computed as,

   

here, the computation of Σse is done by assuming that each pm produces a separate 2-cluster solution. the first one is the pm, itself and the second cluster contains the background set of mirnas. to show the decreasing compactness in the pms, these two measures are used and the values computed for the three datasets are shown in the fourth and fifth columns in the tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  respectively. as expected, the se values of the pms generally increase in the order of their derivation. only for the schizophrenia dataset, for δt =  <dig> , a decrease in se may be noted. the value Σse derived for the priority modules with respect to the sizes of the pms is shown in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  notably, there is a direct dependence of the Σse values on the pm sizes  observed for the schizophrenia dataset and two exceptions  for the stem cell dataset). with the reduction in the size of the pms, a larger compact set is introduced in the background module. although this causes a decrease in the se value of the pm, but the se value of the background module increases. however, this increase must be relatively smaller than the decrease in the se of the pm as the Σse value reduces with size .

another important clustering index, the silhouette index  <cit> , is measured to verify the inter-cluster dissimilarity between the pms found. often, the silhouette index  is defined for a single cluster c with respect to a background set v  <cit> . using this measure, the sic/v values have been computed  for the pms derived from all the datasets and are given in the last columns of the tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  the value of sic/v ranges within , with higher values indicating better mined modules. as expected, the values of sic/v of the pms generally decrease in the order of their derivation. some exceptions in this trend may be noted  for the schizophrenia and stem cell dataset for the last few pms, as was also seen in the case of se values. this might be due to the selection of lower density threshold  which is required to be tuned more tightly.

the sizes of the mirna groups found are validated following a method of deriving the upper bound of a clique of a graph  introduced in  <cit> . the upper bound is found to be  <dig> by setting δ =  <dig> ,  <dig> by setting δ =  <dig> , and  <dig> by setting δ =  <dig>  for the schizophrenia dataset, tissue-specific and stem cell datasets, respectively. these are the expected sizes of the most compact mirna modules present in the networks. from the pruning method we have used, the sizes of the significant set of mirnas are found as  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . these are significantly similar to the upper bounds derived theoretically, and thus important.

the motivation of the current work may bias the importance of the mining method by suggesting that it is suitable only for the mirna expression data or scalable up to their standard size . but, this is not the case. the procedure is equally good for a gene expression dataset. the mirna expression datasets are studied here to motivate our hypothesis on tf-mirna regulation. however, for verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method a gene expression dataset was considered. this dataset consists of expression values of  <dig> genes over  <dig> time points . the results show that the proposed method is well applicable to this larger dataset indicating its scalability. moreover, the discussion on the algorithmic complexity  highlight that it is polynomial in nature. in the following subsections, we include an exhaustive analysis for validating the pms in the perspective of bioinformatics research incorporating visual, statistical and biological analysis.

visual validation
expression profile plot is a well-known tool for visualizing expression data  <cit> . a standard expression data contains the expression values over some experiments/conditions  for a set of genes/mirnas. an expression profile plot shows the graphs of the degree of expression values in combination of all the expression vectors over the columns. thus, a compact expression profile plot  represents a coherent module. the expression profiles of the selected mirnas in the pms and the background set of mirnas are plotted in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the proposed method iteratively prepares a few sets of significant mirnas  from the mirnas present in the microarray data by mining the constructed fcgs . thus, the residual part of the mirnas, identified as unimportant ones, are kept as the background set. for all the three datasets, the significant fragment of the mirnas selected by the proposed method spans a compact band of expression levels within the complete band of expression levels of all the mirnas. more closer two expression levels denote a higher degree of co-expression between the corresponding mirnas. in case of the schizophrenia dataset, we observe an additional band of selected mirnas around the expression value  <dig>  this is due to the inherent nature of the proposed mining tool of giving importance to the compactness within the pms over the connectedness between them  <cit> .

performing a rigorous survey, we observed some limitations of the conventional tools  used for visualizing expression data. these tools are not statistically informative. in particular, the quantitative range of expression values are not observable, deviation in the data can not be expressed and the outliers can not be highlighted through these plots. a novel visual validation plot, referred to as quartile deviation plot , that can take care of these limitations, has been introduced in this study. the set of expression values of all the mirnas for a specific experiment  is considered as an experiment-specific expression vector. a qdp combines, for each such experiment, the plots of lower quartile, median, and upper quartile values of these expression vectors. the maximum whisker length  is taken as  <dig> , which is a default one  <cit> . the qdps for all the datasets explored are shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> show the qdps of the mirnas mined as significant from the three datasets by the proposed method, whereas the figures  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> show the qdps of all the mirnas present in the datasets. the selected mirnas, as can be seen from these figures, are relatively more coherent in nature as compared to the complete set. again from these figures, we can effectively observe the expression pattern , expression deviation , outliers  and also the statistical details  pertaining the datasets. thus, the newly proposed qdp tool demonstrates its effectiveness in computational biology.

to visually validate the degrading coherence within the pms, the expression profile plots  and the qdps of each of the clusters found from the datasets are prepared. figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> show the plots for the schizophrenia dataset . as expected, the pms show decreasing order of coherence as they are evolved through the proposed methodology. moreover, on examining the qdps more closely, the actual width of the expression band of the pms can be determined for the pms gradually derived by the proposed algorithm.

statistical validation
for the statistical analysis of the pms, we have used a randomized model  <cit> . here, a cluster matrix of size n × k  is first constructed from the information available about the pms. an element  in the cluster matrix is assigned a value "1", if mirna i is found in the pm j, otherwise it is set to "0". depending on the matrix, an r-randomized degree preserving model is derived by randomly swapping the edges r times for computing the co-occurrence of mirna pairs by chance. using the model, the p-values  of the co-occurrence of all the mirna pairs in the pms are computed for all the three datasets. we obtained the values  <dig> e- <dig>  2e- <dig> and <1e- <dig> for the schizophrenia, tissue-specific and stem cell datasets, respectively. this shows that the results obtained are not by chance and the pms are statistically significant.

the method of finding pms have a close resemblance with the clustering approaches applied to expression data  <cit> . despite the fact that their motivations differ, a clustering solution ordered in the descending degree of coherence within the clusters can be thought of as a set of pms. so, we include here a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method with some existing clustering methods in evolving the priority modules. for this purpose, some appreciated clustering methods viz., k-means, average linkage hierarchical  and complete linkage hierarchical clustering from matlab, diana and fanny from the r package, iclust  <cit>  from the author's code, som from the standard codes, and simm-ts on request from the corresponding author are considered. the algorithm given in table  <dig> is written in c language compatible with the gcc compiler in unix platform. the comparative results are described in additional file  <dig> section  <dig> . in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the distribution of the cluster sizes found by various methods are shown. the distribution of the pms derived by the proposed one are found to be comparatively more even in nature.

a current survey  <cit>  classifies the cluster validation measures depending on the clustering criterion into the types – compactness, connectedness, separation, combinations, stability, preservation of distance, and specialized cases. the current work is motivated from the selection of pms with decreasing compactness. therefore, a novel internal validation measure to figure out the compactness of the clusters is used here. this compactness measure, the normalized squared error , of a priority mining solution with k modules is computed as,

   

where |ci| denotes the number of data points in the cluster ci. the Σnse measure shown in eqn.  normalizes the se values of the clusters with respect to their sizes. this helps to reduce the biased contribution of tiny modules with high compactness in the coherence measure. a lower Σnse value denotes a higher compactness within the modules. by applying the clustering methods considered in this study on the significant modules found by the proposed method for all the three datasets we found some clusters. after ordering them in the descending order of coherence, we assume them to be pms. after computing the Σnse values for all the methods to be compared , we found that the proposed one is evidently a good one in identifying pms. the sizes of the pms obtained from several approaches like upgma or diana seems to be irrelevant  in the perspective of biology research. they largely fail to identify multiple strong modules and get stuck in finding one large module. others are better in this sense, specially fanny and the proposed one, to locate well-distributed coherent modules.

biological validation
from a biological perspective, it may be expected that the mirnas within a single pm are regulated by common tfs. to verify this hypothesis, an exhaustive biological investigation has been conducted. since the complete information related to tf-mirna regulation is not yet available, we relied on the established knowledge of the conserved tfbss based on the ucsc hg <dig> genome assembly  <cit> . we have used the wgrna table under the sno/mirna track of this database  pertaining to the information about the location of mirnas in the chromosomes. motivated from an earlier study  <cit> , the region  <dig> kb upstream of the start of an mirna sequence is defined as the putative regulatory region of the mirna assumed to contain the regulatory binding sites. after defining the putative regulatory regions of the mirnas found in the individual pms, we identified the tfs, which are known to bind to this region, from the tfbsconssites table under the tfbs conserved track in the ucsc table browser  <cit> . in this way the list of the mirna pairs, containing the tfbss of common regulatory tfs in their putative upstream region, belonging to a single pm are accumulated for the study .

all the consecutive pms are exhaustively tested to examine their significance in providing tf-mirna regulation information found from the three datasets. the number of the mirnas that are possibly regulated by common tfs by binding to the region upstream of 5' end are given in table  <dig> as obtained for all the pms derived from the datasets. for all these datasets, we found very large number of tf-mirna regulation information for the first few modules. equivalently for all these datasets, the later modules are found to provide lesser information in this regard. some of the results of table  <dig> may emphasize that some of the initial  modules are less important. but, reasonably these are very small modules and therefore cannot capture significant information. again, such results suggest the appropriate selection of the controlling parameters δ and ξ for mining biologically more significant results. it may be noted that for pm  <dig> found from the schizophrenia dataset, tf information is available for only  <dig> of the  <dig> mirnas. of these,  <dig> mirnas are found having common tfs in their putative 5' ur as per the established results collected from ucsc browser. similarly,  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas, from a total of  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas, are found to have common such tfs from the total  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas selected in pm <dig> obtained from the tissue-specific and stem cell datasets, respectively. the tf v$aml <dig>  <dig> is found to bind in the  <dig> kb 5' ur of a large set of  <dig> mirnas  which were selected in the most significant module identified from the schizophrenia dataset. thus their chance of being commonly regulated becomes higher. on examining each such modules, the prioritywise descending ones are found to provide common tfs regulating smaller modules. in fact, none of priority modules generated starting from the fifth ones are found to explore commonly regulated mirna modules of size higher than three in case of the schizophrenia dataset. equally promising results are also obtained when the top pms derived from the tissue-specific dataset  <cit>  is analyzed yielding large number of common tfs. for the tissue-specific dataset, some of the tfs were found to possibily regulate upto  <dig> mirnas even in the eighth priority module. but the sizes of such commonly regulated mirna groups are found to be even more larger in the prior modules. we found the two tfs v$aml <dig>  <dig> and v$foxo <dig>  <dig> binding within the  <dig> kb region of the 5' ur of at least  <dig> mirnas for this dataset. similar observasions are also obtained by examining the list of mirna pairs having common tfs binding in their 5' ur obtained from the stem cell dataset. the results given in table  <dig> for this dataset highlight the prominent significance of the pms up to the third one. the rest of the modules contain minor mirna groups that may provide week but important regulatory coherence. thus, the results obtained from all the datasets resembles with the motivation of ordering biologically significant modules and extracting regulation information from them.

the number of the mirna pairs present in the pms found to be regulated by common tfs for all the three datasets.

since computational analysis of mirna regulation is still in a nascent stage, such information is biologically significant. the pms provide information, in a compact form, about a set of mirnas that might be regulated by common tfs. interestingly, in many cases it has been observed that some mirnas present in consecutive pms  are associated with same tfs. this might indicate that these mirnas should have been within a single pm, but got separated because of the choice of the density decay constant . thus an exhaustive sensitivity analysis of the method on ξ needs to be carried out in future. details are shown in table  <dig>  the assignment of optimal association density threshold  value and the density decay constant  play an important role in the selection of significant module by the proposed mining methodology. this parameter, not tuned properly might cause the inclusion of irrelevant mirnas in the significant module selected or might disrupt the comprehensiveness of this significant module.

biological insight
biological findings are often biased by probabilistic events. thus, it becomes important to justify that the findings are not received by chance. to show the biological importance of the information received on tf-mirna regulation, statistical tests were performed. we have carried out the statistical evaluation of the results obtained for all the datasets. a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> commonly regulated mirna pairs are found in the modules received by applying the proposed mining technique on schizophrenia, tissue-specific and stem cell datasets, respectively. now to verify the significance of this count, modularization solutions have been generated by randomization and the same count has been performed on them. on analyzing them, we received  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> commonly regulated mirna pairs on an average over  <dig>  randomized trial runs. the p-values computed are shown in table  <dig> for the three datasets. not a single one of the  <dig>  randomized solutions, for all the datasets, are found to exceed the original result in terms of commonly regulated mirna pair count. these low p-values justify the biological significance of the proposed method in predicting tf-mirna regulation.

the p-values computed to statistically evaluate the occurrence of commonly regulated mirna pairs found by the proposed method in the schizophrenia, tissue-specific and stem cell dataset.

a deeper in silico analysis of the pms derived by the heuristic mining procedure sheds light on some important biological results hitherto unexplored. in a recent study  <cit> , the molecular evolution of an mirna cluster and its paralogs has been reconstructed. this cluster of mirnas consists of hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-19a, hsa-mir-19b, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-106a, and hsa-mir-106b. to study the co-expression similarity of this set of mirnas, we investigated the pms that contain these mirnas from the results of the schizophrenia dataset. most of these mirnas are found in separate pms or are pruned out, and therefore, are not co-expressed. strikingly, although the hsa-mir-19a and hsa-mir-19b are known to be closely related mature sequences , yet they are not found in same pms . this might be due to the reason that they are evolutionary clustered. in short, they are not found to be co-expressed although they are paralogs. therefore, this indicates that the expression profiles might not be dependent on the evolutionary relationship of the mirnas.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper introduces a novel unsupervised method of exploring commonly regulated modules of human mirnas by targeting tfs. the method integrates a self-pruning subroutine to discard the portion of the microarray data that might be noisy or insignificant for the particular study. the method has a different motivation from a general clustering approach. it can produce priority-based modules pertaining biological significance. for validating the efficacy of the pruning methodology, a novel tool is devised for visualizing the expression data from a statistical perspective. the results show the generation of a set of pms in the decreasing order of statistical significance. the coherence of these modules is validated with a novel compactness measure. biologically, with respect to regulation by tfs, this ordering might not be important, even though these pms are found to be effective in the exploration of tf-mirna regulatory activity. by a deeper analysis, a large number of tfs are identified, which might be regulating multiple mirnas common to a module. supporting an earlier study  <cit> , these results might be significant for reconstructing the complex regulatory network that hypothetically exists between tfs and mirnas. the results also indicate that the mirnas which are evolutionarily related may not be biologically corregulated.
