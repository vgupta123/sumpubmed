BACKGROUND
white adipose tissue  has a central role in various physiological processes related to lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis in mammals  <cit>  and is considered to be a significant contributor to systemic low-grade inflammation  <cit> . adipose tissue development is triggered by the imbalance between energy intake and expenditure and most related studies have exploited high-fat hyper-caloric diets to generate adipose tissue expansion and document molecular alterations . the nutrient source is also important in determining adiposity. noticeably, dietary fibers, which are poorly digested by monogastric animals, are associated with energy dilution of the diet, hence reducing the adiposity that accompanies the chronic intake of high levels of fat  <cit> . this reduction results from a lower food intake, enhanced insulin sensitivity, increased energy expenditure, and changes in expression levels of some genes involved in lipid anabolism and fatty acid β-oxidation, in different organs  <cit> . however, the diversity in molecular pathways in at which can be altered by a high-fat high-fiber diet remains still to be clarified, together with the ways by which these changes relate to adiposity variations. the pig is recognized as an experimental model to investigate genetic and mechanistic aspects of human disease such as obesity , and is a leading source of animal protein in human diets. the introduction of more fiber to cereal-based diets formulated for pigs has regained interest due to both economic considerations and the potential benefits on health and welfare  <cit> . while, the addition of fat to a fiber-rich diet is also required to retain a dietary energy value compatible with good animal performance  <cit> . therefore, the primary objective of this study was to decipher the transcriptomic changes that take place in at when pigs received either a high-fat high-fiber diet or an isocaloric low-fat high-starch diet, thus changing energy source and nutrients rather than energy content in diet. the availability of pig lines divergently selected for residual feed intake , a measure of feed efficiency, offers an additional opportunity to consider line-associated differences in basal metabolism and energy expenditure  <cit>  when reasoning body composition and dietary responses. both independent and possible interaction effects between diet and line on the at transcriptional profiles have then to be considered.

the anatomical location of at is also important when analyzing the molecular responses to diet. in many species  <cit>  including pigs  <cit> , differences in adipogenic factors, responses to hormones, metabolic properties or secretion of inflammatory cytokines have been observed between subcutaneous at and visceral ats which are located within the abdominal cavity. whereas subcutaneous fat grows at the same rate as total body fat, perirenal  fat grows faster in pigs; thus, the distinction between these two anatomical fat sites is also economically important. hence, similarities and particularities in the molecular responses to diet of subcutaneous and perivisceral ats are worthy of investigation. it has recently been shown that at expansion was reduced at the subcutaneous and perirenal locations when growing pigs of two divergent rfi lines were fed a high-fat high-fiber diet as compared with pigs fed an isocaloric low-fat high-starch diet  <cit> . molecular mechanisms and processes associated with both diet and line in the dorsal subcutaneous and perirenal ats are explored in the present study. pathways common to both ats and also specificities within each at in the responses to diet, are highlighted using dedicated integrated statistical methods.

RESULTS
summary of phenotypic data
forty-eight growing pigs of two lines divergently selected on rfi, a measure of feed efficiency, were fed diets formulated at isocaloric and isoproteic bases but differing in energy source and nutrients . full description of performance of experimental pigs  after 58 days of dietary treatment can be found in an associated paper  <cit>  and are briefly summarized here. importantly, there was no interaction between diet and line on performance and body composition. irrespective of rfi line, pigs fed the high-fat high-fiber  diet ate 12 % less  than pigs fed the low-fat low-fiber starch-based  diet during the trial and they developed less body fat, as illustrated by  <dig> -fold lower proportions of ats at the perirenal  and dorsal subcutaneous  locations. the differences between diets were significant when the adiposity data was corrected for individual daily feed intake, indicating that at development was triggered not only by differences in feed intake between pigs but also by the nutrient composition. irrespective of diet, divergent selection for rfi did not affect at weights in this experiment .table  <dig> growth and adiposity as affected by diet and line


apigs were fed a high-fat high-fiber diet  or a low-fat high-starch diet . duration of the feeding trial was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days for all pigs. two divergent pig lines that have been selected over eight generations for residual feed intake , a measure of feed efficiency, were used. pigs selected for low rfi were the most efficient in the conversion of food to weight gain. there was no significant interaction  between diet and line on performance and adiposity traits. at the end of the trial, weights of perirenal and dorsal subcutaneous adipose tissues  were used as surrogates of body adiposity



diet markedly affected adipose tissue molecular profiles
microarray analyses were separately performed in prat and in scat from the  <dig> experimental pigs. after normalization, the signal intensity was found to be above background noise for  <dig>  spots in prat and  <dig>  spots in scat, respectively. the linear model to analyze the log2-transformed signals revealed no significant interaction  between diet and line on the expression levels of the molecular probes in the two ats, so that diet and line effects could be inferred independently. the global effects of diet and of line on the number of differentially-expressed probes  were more pronounced in prat than in scat . in the two ats, diet had also a more pronounced effect on the transcriptome than did the line. thus, only data related to dietary effects are further considered in this manuscript. by using cut-offs of fold-change between diets > | <dig> | and p-value <  <dig> , while ensuring benjamini-hochberg  multiplicity correction of the p-values for a control of the fdr at level <  <dig> , a total of  <dig>  dep in prat and of  <dig>  dep in scat were found as over-expressed by hf diet. these corresponded to  <dig>  unique differentially-genes  up-regulated in prat and to  <dig> unique deg up-regulated in scat. conversely,  <dig>  dep corresponding to  <dig>  unique deg in prat, and  <dig>  dep corresponding to  <dig>  unique deg in scat were under-expressed by hf diet. altogether,  <dig>  deg were commonly affected by diet across the two ats , which corresponded to 36 % of the deg in prat and 63 % of the deg in scat, respectively.fig  <dig> number of differentially-expressed probes and corresponding unique genes in adipose tissues as affected by diet and line. microarray data obtained in subcutaneous  or in perirenal  adipose tissues were separately analyzed for the main effects of diet , line , and the interaction between diet and line. molecular probes were declared as differentially-expressed between diets or between lines according to cutoffs for fold-change between conditions > | <dig> | and p <  <dig>  . venn diagrams illustrate the number of differentially-expressed probes in each experimental group for scat and for prat. the corresponding number of differentially-expressed unique genes is indicated into brackets



similarities in the molecular responses to diet across two adipose tissues
multiple factor analysis  was performed to derive a common framework of molecular responses to diet and identify the communalities across at. the basic interest of mfa as a data integration procedure  <cit>  was to ensure that each tissue influence was equally weighed in a manageable number of comprised factors, which can then be related to external phenotypic characteristics. figure  <dig> shows the diagnostic mfa plot. the first dimension  of the mfa accounted for 31 % of the variation, and correlated significantly to variations in at weights , so that pigs fed the hf diet and pigs fed the lf diet were oppositely represented along dim <dig>  the second dimension of the mfa  explained  <dig>  % of the variation and did not clearly separate the data according to diet or adiposity phenotypic traits.fig  <dig> multi-way datasets analysis: consensus in microarray data relative to dietary effect across two adipose tissues. the first two synthetic variables obtained for the perirenal  and subcutaneous adipose tissue  transcriptomes were projected in the correlation circle of the multiple factor analysis , an integrated statistical method used to reveal communalities across separate datasets. large similarities across adipose tissues can be deduced from molecular variables contributing to the first dimension  of mfa . relative weights of perirenal fat  and subcutaneous fat  were superimposed on the plot, showing strong correlation between the molecular probes contributing to dim <dig> and adiposity variations. pigs were represented on the scatter mfa plot  and colored following the diet they received . this shows a well-defined partition of pigs between diets along dim1



as illustrated , the two first comprised variables synthesizing the molecular information of the originally-distinct data tables  were projected together along dim <dig> in the mfa plot. this means that large similarities between ats could be inferred by focusing on the dep that contributed mainly to dim <dig>  a total of  <dig>  dep showing the highest correlation with dim <dig>  were thus commonly regulated by diet across the two ats. the identity of these dep together with their fold-changes between hf and lf diets are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> for prat and for scat, respectively; as indicated in this additional file, all these dep were altered by diet . they corresponded to  <dig> unique differentially-expressed genes . this statistical approach was thus useful in reducing the number of deg commonly regulated by diet across the two ats to those having the strongest correlation with variations in at weights.

a functional analysis was performed to understand the biological meaning behind this subset of  <dig> deg, by using automatic functional annotation tools to identify biological gene ontology  terms and clustering redundant annotation terms in enriched biological pathways. enrichment  score ≥  <dig>  and p-value <  <dig>  were used to select the top-enriched clusters among these deg. as indicated in table  <dig>  the modification-dependent protein catabolic process, intracellular protein transport, coenzyme metabolic process, cellular response to stress, phosphorus metabolic process and hexose metabolic process were the top-enriched biological pathways in the common molecular responses of ats to diet. the detailed list of genes included in these clusters can be found in additional file 2: table s <dig>  to have details on fold-change of these genes between diets, one may also consult additional file 1: table s <dig> table  <dig> enriched biological processes commonly regulated by diet across adipose tissues


athe most important genes in the common dietary-related responses across perirenal and subcutaneous adipose tissues and correlating with adiposity variations were considered to list enriched functional clusters. for each cluster based on gene ontology  terms for biological processes and genomes  biological pathways, the enrichment  score, the number  of differentially-expressed genes  and associated p-value were provided. the direction of changes in gene expression levels by the hf diet was symbolized  together with the number of unique genes concerned by each change



among protein catabolic process, the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis was the most represented pathway with a total of  <dig> genes encoding ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, different ubiquitin ligases, various ubiquitin-like proteins and different proteasome complex subunits responsible for the degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins, which were down-regulated by the hf diet . similarly, the glucose metabolic process assembled  <dig> genes, all down-regulated by the hf diet, and coding for enzymes acting in the first step of glucose use , catalyzing glycogen synthesis  or linking glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle . different factors in coenzyme metabolic processes such as those related to the synthesis of cytosolic acetyl-coa  and lipid anabolic process  were also all down-regulated by the hf diet, with the noticeable exception of glutathione s-transferase kappa  <dig>  which functions in cellular detoxification. conversely, cellular responses to stress included some genes up-regulated in the hf diet  as well as genes that were down-regulated by the same diet . other gene groups with a lower enrichment score  but p <  <dig>  could be also regarded as potentially interesting in deciphering the molecular mechanisms modulated by the diet, i.e. the response to hormone stimulus, regulation of cell death and cell mitotic process . indeed, although dietary-modulated transcripts in ats were not primarily enriched in lipid metabolism, individual genes clustered in the response to hormone stimulus had known relationships with lipid metabolic process: the cytosolic enzyme malic enzyme  that generates nadph for fatty acid biosynthesis and which was down-regulated >  <dig> fold  by the hf diet, the leptin  coding for a protein secreted in ats to regulate food intake and energy expenditure and which exhibited >  <dig> -fold reduction in its expression level in hf pigs , the low-density lipoprotein receptor  reduced by >  <dig> -fold  by hf diet, and the adiponectin receptor  that mediates lipid oxidation and was also significantly lowered  for pigs fed the hf diet. conversely, igf1r coding for the insulin-growth factor  <dig> receptor binding igf-i, a well-known regulator of cell development, and which was first listed in the significantly-enriched phosphorus metabolic process, was also included in the less enriched clusters corresponding to the response to hormone stimulus and the regulation of cell death; this gene was one of the top genes being up-regulated by hf diet. altogether, different genes were thus listed in more than one of these pathways, suggesting that these various biological processes were at least in part, inter-connected.

particularities of perirenal adipose tissue response to diet
to provide another representation of the transcriptional changes in ats response to diet, the weighed gene correlation network analysis  was used to capture strong relationships between transcripts in modules of interconnected genes  <cit> . in each module, the eigengene  was calculated to relate transcriptional changes to external phenotypic traits and to deduce the biological meaning of the module. four distinct network modules were thus obtained .table  <dig> co-expressed gene networks in adipose tissues in response to diet

afive co-expressed gene network modules were deduced from the dataset of differentially-expressed probes  in response to diet  and obtained in perirenal  and subcutaneous  adipose tissues. the total number of dep included within each module and the number of dep from each tissue in the module were indicated



the first two big modules represented 48 % and 20 % of the dep, respectively. the first module  included a higher number of dep from prat than from scat, and the second one  had almost an equal number of dep from the two adipose tissues. eigengenes in the turquoise and blue modules were highly correlated to the first comprised dimension dim <dig> in mfa , suggesting that these modules included not much more supplementary biological meaning than that deduced from dim <dig>  two smaller network modules represented 11 % and 7 % of the dep data set, respectively. the brown module corresponded mainly to a co-expression network in dep from scat; however, most of these dep were also found in prat including gene transcripts related to protein catabolic process, protein transport, pyruvate metabolism and cell respiration. the pattern of expression in the yellow module was mainly assigned to prat; only 4 % of the dep in this module were also listed as differentially-expressed in scat in response to diet. in addition, the eigengene of this yellow module was not highly correlated with %prat , suggesting that molecular mechanisms unrelated to adipose expansion were predominant in this module. thus, biological particularities at the prat location in the dietary-associated responses can be revealed by further examining the interconnected genes in the yellow module.

a total of  <dig> dep corresponding to  <dig> unique deg were listed in the yellow module. most of the dep  were up-regulated by the hf diet . altogether,  <dig> dep corresponding to  <dig> unique deg, all up-regulated by the hf diet, were highly correlated to the eigengene of the yellow module , so that they could be considered as very relevant for the biological meaning of this module. functional clustering of these  <dig> deg revealed defense response including inflammatory and innate immune responses, membrane organization, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, and protein amino-acid phosphorylation as the top-enriched biological processes ; the detailed list of genes within each cluster can be found in additional file 4: table s <dig> table  <dig> biological meaning of co-expressed genes in perirenal adipose tissue of pigs


aunique annotated genes being highly correlated  to the eigengene of the yellow small module  were inferred for their gene ontology  terms for biological processes. functional clusters having enrichment  score >  <dig> and modified fisher exact p-value less than  <dig>  were indicated. all genes were up-regulated  in perirenal adipose tissue when pigs were fed a high-fat high-fiber  diet compared with a low-fat high-starch  diet



intra-modular connectivity can measure how connected a gene is to the other genes of its module. intra-modular connectivity values pointed the following genes as among the  <dig> first most important nodes in the yellow module : the cytokine interleukin- <dig>  and its receptor  which are involved in anti-inflammatory response, three q sub-components of the complement component  <dig> system  and the cytochrome b- <dig>  which are involved in reactions participating to innate immunity, arrestin beta- <dig>  causing specific dampening of cellular responses to stimuli, and a member of the vav gene family  as a natural killer playing role in t-cell and b-cell development.table  <dig> most important genes participating to particularities in response to diet of perirenal adipose tissue

athe first  <dig> genes were ranked according to their connectivity value within the yellow module, which assembled a total of  <dig> unique genes in perirenal adipose tissue, all up-regulated by a high-fat high-fiber diet. the higher is the connectivity value, the stronger is the evidence that the gene is part of the module



upstream regulatory candidates
the two above-described analyses have clearly shown that different biological pathways were involved in responses to diet; therefore, it is important to identify upstream regulators which coordinate these molecular changes in porcine ats. for this purpose, the transcripts of genes identified as differentially-expressed by diet within each at were submitted to a dedicated algorithm  which matches the lists of dep to a causality graph of reactions and regulations built from transpath® database information, and ranks upstream candidates in accordance to their ability to regulate significant numbers of the dep. the obtained candidates were listed in additional file 5: table s <dig> for prat and in additional file 6: table s <dig> for scat. a biological post-prioritization in these candidates was manually made by adding gobp terms. only a summary of the most relevant candidates was given in table  <dig>  but more background information on the biological processes in which the candidates may play a role is provided in additional file 5: tables <dig> and additional file 6: table s <dig> table  <dig> candidates for upstream regulatory roles in functional pathways altered by diets

athe lists of differentially-expressed genes in porcine perirenal  or subcutaneous  adipose tissues in response to diet were automatically confronted to the academic information on regulations and reactions in mammalian cell signaling. genes that were able to regulate a significant number of the differentially-expressed genes were proposed as upstream regulatory candidates. the biological processes in which these genes could be involved were indicated as referenced in the gene ontology  entrez database. the complete lists of candidates are given in additional file 5: table s <dig> for prat and additional file 6: table s <dig> for scat



dietary-related changes in expression levels of  <dig> genes were studied by qpcr in the  <dig> samples of prat and the  <dig> samples of scat to provide a functional validation among the graph driven-hypothesis upstream candidates. in the two ats, the majority of the examined candidates were significantly affected by diet .fig.  <dig> expression levels of transcription factors examined by qpcr as affected by diet in adipose tissues. the %variation ratio in expression level of each target gene was shown for hf diet  relative to lf diet  for perirenal  and subcutaneous  adipose tissues. when a gene was down-regulated by the hf diet, the value was preceded by a minus sign. ***p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> , *p <  <dig> , t <dig>  < p <  <dig> 



this included the under-expression by the hf diet of the mlx interacting protein-like mlxipl  and the sterol-regulatory binding protein- <dig> , two transcriptional factors known to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism. the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta δ and the retinoic x receptor alpha rxra forming heterodimers to bind promoters of target genes in energy metabolism and apoptotic process were also down-regulated by the hf diet in the two ats; however, pparα isotype was confirmed as under-expressed  only in scat. pparγ, the last isotype of the ppar family having pleiotropic functions in lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation was conversely up-regulated by the hf diet in the two ats. it is noteworthy that the direction of change in pparγ mrna levels between hf and lf diet by qpcr was inconsistent with the sign of variation predicted by the algorithm , so that pparγ was regulated by diet in a way opposite to the two other ppar isotypes. the o-linked n-acetylglucosamine transferase ogt regulating protein ubiquitination and cell death and the protein phosphatase  <dig> regulatory subunit 1a  known to regulate glycogen metabolism were also confirmed as being up-regulated by the hf diet. surprisingly, the retinoic acid receptor alpha  involved in apoptotic process was regulated in an opposite manner between the two ats. specificities for prat were further enlightened for three upstream candidates that were over-expressed in hf pigs, without any significant variations in their expression levels compared with lf pigs in scat: rxrg involved in mediating the anti-proliferative effects of retinoic acid, the nuclear respiratory factor nrf <dig> involved in cell response to stress, and the myocyte enhancer factor mef2a involved in innate immune response. finally, the relative expression levels of usf <dig>  srebf <dig>  nef2l <dig> and galnt <dig> did not differ between diets in the two porcine ats. except for galnt <dig> in prat and nfe2l <dig> in scat, this was in agreement with microarray data  which indicated no significant variations in these gene transcripts when pigs were fed hf or lf diets. we observed that sirtuin  <dig>  was not proposed as an upstream regulatory candidate of the at transcriptomes, although this gene currently attract much attention in the literature; a detailed examination of the list of deg revealed its up-regulation by the hf diet notably in prat .

discussion
irrespective of species, there are still a limited number of studies which have deciphered the effects of changing dietary energy source rather than dietary energy level on gene expression levels in at  <cit> . a recent study on iberian pigs revealed only minor influences of dietary energy source  on dorsal subcutaneous fat transcriptome  <cit> . in the present study, feeding pigs a diet rich in lipids  and fibers  during 58 days led to  <dig> -fold reduction in adiposity as opposed to pigs fed a ration characterized by starch as the main energy source. large numbers of genes in perirenal at and, to a lesser extent in subcutaneous at, exhibited dietary-related changes in expression levels. complementary integrative statistical methods and functional bioinformatics tools were thus used on the transcript data sets to identify the most important metabolic pathways accounting for dietary-related variations adiposity across the two ats.

depressed catabolic protein process and lower glucose use for anabolic pathways were primarily associated with reduced body adiposity by a high-fat high-fiber diet
among the  <dig> unique genes which exhibited close-similar dietary-induced variations in their expression levels across the two ats, protein catabolic process was suggested as the top- down-regulated pathway acting in adiposity variation by diet. down-regulation of the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and proteasome pathway has been previously reported in the liver for a specific strain of mice fed a high-fat diet compared with a carbohydrate chow diet  <cit> . in the present study, it is possible that molecular changes related to protein catabolism have also resulted from the introduction of insoluble fiber in the pig diet, which may have compromised dietary protein digestibility and nitrogen retention  <cit> . the finding of lower plasma level of lysine, an indispensable amino-acid, in pigs fed the hf diet as compared with pigs fed the lf diet in our associated study  <cit>  supports this hypothesis. although the relationships between potential changes in the ubiquitin-proteasome system and at development cannot be fully elucidated, roles in the regulation of proteins involved in cell division, cell death and signal transduction  <cit>  could be inferred. indeed, dietary-related modulations in groups of genes regulating apoptosis and cell cycle progression were observed across ats in the present study. altogether, finding reduced expression of genes coding for proteasome subunits in ats of the leanest hf pigs is consistent with data in murine 3 t3-l <dig> adipocytes showing that proteasome inhibition led to impaired adipocyte differentiation and decreased lipid content  <cit> .

considering the differences in lipid and starch contents between hf and lf diets, the modulation of several gene transcripts related to glucose metabolism in the two ats was expected. different glucose anabolic pathways were suggested to be repressed by the hf diet, likely due to the down-regulation of hexokinase  <dig>  which catalyzes the first step in glucose metabolic pathways  <cit> . even though at contain only traces of glycogen, finding depressed transcriptional levels of different genes related to glycogen synthesis in hf pigs suggests that variations in glycogen metabolic enzymes may be produced by nutritional treatments in porcine at as previously observed in the rat  <cit> . it is reasonable to speculate relationships between glycogen metabolism in at and adiposity variation, considering recent findings showing that knocking-down glycogen synthase kinase  <dig> beta  inhibits preadipocyte differentiation  <cit> . the lower expression levels of the pyruvate kinase and different members of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which were observed in the two ats of hf pigs, suggest that the outflow from the glycolytic pathway to mitochondria might be also reduced in these pigs. at the molecular level, these observations fit with the depressed basal activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase reported in at of rats adapted to a high fat diet compared with rats fed a high glucose diet  <cit> . in contrast with human and rats, the porcine at is considered the main lipogenic site  <cit> , so that glucose utilization and de novo lipid synthesis are inextricably intertwined in pig ats. therefore, the down-regulations of genes participating to co-factor metabolic processes such as atp-citrate lyase  responsible of cytosolic acetyl-coa production and malic enzyme , the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo lipogenesis in the pig  <cit> , suggest that lipid synthesis from carbohydrates was reduced in ats when feeding pigs the hf diet. less obvious, the down-regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase  may reduce cholesterol synthesis in ats of hf-fed pigs. in agreement, interactive effects between dietary fat and dietary fiber have been reported with regard to cholesterol-related traits in pig at  <cit> .

no reciprocal stimulation of lipid metabolism occurred in ats when lipids and insoluble fibers were included in the diet
usually, inhibiting lipogenesis does not disrupt at growth if extracellular lipids are available. in the present study, we did not find any specific enrichment in lipid-related pathways among genes regulated by diet. however, the low-density lipoprotein receptor , which can directly internalize triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnants as whole-particles into adipose cells  <cit> , was down-regulated by the hf diet. due to the wheat-straw-derived fiber consumption, part of the dietary lipids may have been sequestrated into the viscera and subsequently reduced quantities are readily to provide energy to sustain fat development in hf pigs. an increase in the weight of the digestive tract and increased hepatic lipid content in hf pigs compared with lf pigs support to this hypothesis  <cit> . furthermore, the lep gene encoding leptin, an adipokine secreted by ats to regulate food intake and energy expenditure, was found down-regulated in ats of hf pigs, an observation which was in agreement with the reduced circulating concentration of leptin reported in our associated study on the same pigs  <cit> . finally, due to the down-regulation of its receptor  in ats of hf-fed pigs, it is tempting to speculate that there is an alteration to adiponectin signaling, another adipocyte-related protein that may facilitate adipose expansion in situation of extra-nutrients supply  <cit> . direct measurements of circulating adiponectin concentrations and of adipor1/2r in skeletal muscle and liver are however needed to unravel the significance of this change with regard to the control of carcass fat and insulin signaling.

upstream transcriptional factors were suggested to act on metabolic flexibility in ats in response to contrasted dietary nutrients
as each gene can participate in more than one biological pathway and because many biological processes are highly inter-connected, it is of interest to decipher the main upstream regulators in the molecular pathways participating in the observed limitation of fat expansion by the hf diet. the influence graph-driven qpcr validation provides evidence for the carbohydrate responsive element binding protein chrebp also known as mlx-interacting protein-like , as a pivotal transcriptional mediator down-regulated by the hf diet in porcine ats. this was expected considering that this gene is conversely activated in response to high glucose  to up-regulate several genes involved in the metabolic conversion of glucose to fat in the rodent liver  <cit> . moreover, glucose-related stimulation of lipogenic gene expressions through chrebp has been recently demonstrated in porcine primary adipocytes  <cit> . another classically-recognized gene regulator controlling the expression of nearly all genes integral to glucose use for anabolic purpose  <cit>  is the sterol-regulatory element binding protein- <dig> , which was lesser expressed in ats when pig were fed the hf diet. down-expression in srebf <dig> expression by an increased dietary fat intake irrespective of the type of fibers included in diet was similarly revealed in porcine subcutaneous at  <cit> . this gene is responsive to increased insulin levels associated with consumption of high carbohydrate diets, so that its reduced expression in ats was in agreement with the reduced insulinemia in the hf pigs reported in our associated study  <cit> . conversely, finding an over-expression of o-glcnac transferase  in the two ats of hf pigs is worthy of interest. indeed, this gene encodes the enzyme responsible for adding o-linked-β-n-acetyl-glucosamine to proteins, thus affecting ubiquitination and subsequent protein degradation. increased ogt mrna expression has been reported in response to glucose starvation in mammals  <cit> , a nutritional situation that is partly comparable to feeding a hf diet. finally, differential regulation of ppars binding fatty acids and their derivatives were suggested in the present study. ppars are nuclear hormone receptors expressed in three isoforms  and each ppar forms a heterodimer with rxr. while pparα is highly expressed in tissues with a high rate of fatty acid oxidation, pparγ is considered as an adipocyte predominant transcription factor and pparδ is ubiquitously expressed. in the two pig ats, the variations observed in hf vs. lf diet were opposite to those reported in mice at where the consumption of fibers induced rather than decreased pparδ expression  <cit>  and decreased rather than increased pparγ-activated processes  <cit> . in support to the present results, short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate however enhance pparγ expression in the stroma vascular fraction isolated from porcine at  <cit> . similarly to our results, pigs fed a diet enriched in oil and fibers also exhibited up-regulation in rxrg, a molecule narrowly related to pparγ expression, when compared with pigs fed carbohydrate-based diet  <cit> . because of their pleiotropic functions in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation, the reasons why pparδ and pparγ may be oppositely regulated by the diet in porcine at deserve further studies.

adiposity-unrelated modulation in inflammation and innate immune responses by a high-fat high-fiber diet was underlined in the perirenal fat
the composition of fatty acids  in ats of pigs generally reflects the dietary fatty acid pattern when fed a high-fat diet and de novo lipogenic intensity when fed a low-fat high-starch diet  <cit> . the nature of fatty acids together with other food compounds may contribute to immune activation and chronic inflammation, irrespective of adiposity variations. in the present study, a module of interconnected dietary-regulated genes that were poorly related to adiposity mass variation but with clear links to defense mechanisms, including immunity and inflammation, was strengthened in prat. among these genes, cyba/cybb genes coding for chains of the oxidase system, a significant contributor to the pathogenic effects of high-fat diets  <cit> , were up-regulated by the hf diet. conversely, many up-regulated transcripts in prat of hf pigs encoded proteins with anti-inflammatory properties, such as interleukin- <dig>  and its receptor il10ra. this observation is in agreement with another study in human at showing of il <dig> activation after ingestion of purified dietary fibers  <cit> . the mrna levels of c1qa/b/c genes were also higher in hf pigs. because the complement c1q is generally protective  <cit> , this may be an argument to support a positive modification in the outcome of inflammation by the hf diet. similarly, vav <dig>  a key negative regulator of macrophage-derived pro-inflammatory cytokine production  <cit> , was up-regulated in prat of hf pigs, suggesting that this benefit may have concerned infiltrated macrophages rather than adipocytes. altogether, these observations suggest that dietary fat and fiber had antagonistic actions on inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways in prat. in support, fiber-rich food consumption attenuated the inflammation induced by the intake of a high-fat diet in the liver  <cit> . in at, the downregulation of genes related to inflammation and immune response has been reported in response to the intake of a diet rich in fat and viscous non-fermentable soluble dietary fiber  <cit> . the modulations in inflammation and immune pathways were the most striking example of contrasting transcriptional adaptation to diets between prat and scat, as the above-mentioned genes were unchanged in scat. in agreement with this finding, porcine visceral at has previously been shown to be enriched in mirnas associated with immune and inflammation responses when compared with subcutaneous at  <cit> . of interest in this study, the nuclear respiratory factor  <dig>  was up-regulated by the hf diet in prat only. while this target is involved in a wide range of processes including proliferation, oxidative stress, apoptosis and innate immune response, long-term nrf <dig> overexpression in 3 t3-l <dig> adipose cells stimulated cytokine expression such as clusters of differentiation attracting macrophages  <cit> . the graph-driven identification of upstream regulatory candidates did not propose sirt <dig>  a master transcriptional regulator of both metabolism and inflammation in response to states of energetic excess and high-fat feeding  <cit> . because sirt <dig> was found up-regulated in prat by hf diet, its role in the protection against pro-inflammatory molecular responses might have been confounded by processes related to ppars  <cit> . moreover, not all changes take place at a transcriptional level, so that functional studies are needed to clarify the role of sirt <dig> protein in porcine at. altogether, the side effects of the hf diet on the modulation of the inflammasome in prat may be important to consider in conditions where chronic inflammation plays an important mitigating role and is contrary to optimal health and growth performance.

CONCLUSIONS
this study presents novel findings on the molecular modulations related to dietary energy source and nutrients in two adipose tissues of growing pigs. particularities in the dietary responses for immunity and inflammation features are again enlightened at the perivisceral location.
