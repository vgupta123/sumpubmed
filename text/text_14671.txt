BACKGROUND
the large-scale sequencing of eukaryotic genomes has revealed that transposable elements  are present ubiquitously and occupy large fractions of genomes: 5% in yeast, 35% in rice, 45% in human, and up to 85% in maize  <cit> . tes are classified into two classes based on their transposition mechanism. class i mobile genetic elements, or retrotransposons, are replicated through rna intermediates by a copy-and-paste mechanism, whereas class ii mobile genetic elements, or dna transposons, move directly from dna via a cut-and-paste mechanism  <cit> .

miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements  are class ii dna transposons that are non-autonomous, with defective or absent of coding genes. mites were identified in the maize genome  <cit>  and later found in arabidopsis, rice, grape, mosquito, fish, bacteria and human as well as in several other genomes  <cit> . due to their extremely high copy numbers, mites can account for a significant fraction of a eukaryotic genome  even though the size of element itself is small  <cit> . individual mites are usually less than 600 bp and a/t rich, with terminal inverted repeats  and 2–11 bp target site duplication  sequences  <cit> . mites, which are relatively stable in the genome, are often closely associated with genic regions and thus can affect gene expression patterns  <cit> . some mites are involved in up-regulation of host genes by providing additional recognition sequences or polya signals to host genes  <cit> . mite insertion into regulatory regions may cause disruption or promotion of gene expression  <cit> . recent studies have found that mites are also a source of small interfering rna  evolution and may play an important role in gene regulation and epigenetic mechanisms  <cit> . mite transposition into a new region of the genome causes insertion polymorphisms among accessions of same species that can be useful tools for development of various markers  <cit> .

the brassicaceae family includes  <dig> genera and  <dig> species, which serve as sources of vegetable, fodder, condiments and oil, with wide range of morphologies, such as chinese cabbage, mustard, cabbage, broccoli, oilseed rape, and other leafy vegetables. the model plant, arabidopsis thaliana is a close relative of the brassica species and belongs to the same family. as a model brassica crop, the b. rapa genome sequence spanning 256 mb euchromatin chromosome spaces was completed recently and released to the public  <cit> .

comparative analysis of brassica species with a. thaliana has revealed up to two additional rounds of recent genome duplication: one triplication and one allopolyploidization that is the major factor responsible for the increased genome size of brassica <cit> . in addition, tes also contribute to increase the genome size of the brassica species and to genome evolution  <cit> . the completed genome sequence of b. rapa revealed that at least  <dig> % of the genome contains tes  <cit> .

in this study, we identified a new mite named brassica rapamite - <dig>  which is present in more than  <dig> copies in the genome of each of three brassica species. we inspected its characteristics and distribution and inferred its potential involvement in the evolution of duplicated genes in the highly replicated brassica genome. we also discovered high amounts of insertion polymorphism inter- and intra-species, which can serve a good source of genetic markers in the brassica species.

RESULTS
characterization of brami- <dig> in brassica
we identified a 260 bp mite in the brassica rapa bac clone, kbrb059a <dig> using must, a de novo program for mite identification, and additional manual inspection. mite characterization on b. rapa contig  using must yielded  <dig> candidate mites and further careful manual inspection of each candidate mite for tir and tsd using self-blast  led to the identification of brami- <dig>  comparison of brami− <dig> against the repeat database  showed 77% similarity to a reported stowaway mite, attirta- <dig> in a. thaliana <cit> . perfect mite insertion was confirmed by comparing one of the representative b. rapa genes  harboring a brami- <dig> insertion with the related empty sites in its non-insertion paralogs   from b. rapa syntenic blocks and its ortholog  in a. thaliana . the mite included 33 bp of highly conserved a/t rich  tirs and was flanked with a unique di-nucleotide ta target site duplication , which are distinct characteristics of the stowaway super-family mites . the secondary structure of the mite was predicted using mfold , which showed a potential dna hairpin-like secondary structure.

blastn searches revealed a total of  <dig> brami- <dig> elements in the 256 mb b. rapa genome sequence. in silico mapping of these elements on the b. rapa pseudo-chromosomes showed that they were evenly distributed in the euchromatin regions of the b. rapa genome . the physical positions of the  <dig> brami- <dig> elements in the b. rapa genome are listed in additional file  <dig>  on average,  <dig> brami- <dig> elements were found on each pseudo-chromosome. mite density analysis  shows chromosome  <dig> , which is the second largest in size, has the high mite density , while the largest chromosome  <dig>  had the less mite density .

we found  <dig> and  <dig> copies in 470 mb of b. oleracea and 15 mb of b. napus shotgun sequences, respectively. based on this, the total numbers of the brami- <dig> mite members were estimated as  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the whole genomes of b. rapa, b. oleracea and b. napus, respectively . by contrast, in a. thaliana we found only  <dig> copies of attirta- <dig>  the closest arabidopsis relative of brami- <dig>  simple comparison revealed that the copy numbers of these mites in brassica genomes are 20– <dig> times more than that of arabidopsis.

blastn was performed at the local database .

phylogenetic analysis of the brami- <dig> elements
phylogenetic analysis was conducted for  <dig> nearly intact mite members that have >80% similarity to brami-1:  <dig> members from b. rapa,  <dig> from b. oleracea, and four from b. napus. in addition,  <dig> attirta- <dig> members from a. thaliana were included. the attirta- <dig> members formed a separate clade from the brassica members, and they were very diverse among themselves. by contrast, brami- <dig> members from the three brassica species were highly conserved and were interspersed with each other  indicating they were rapidly amplified in the brassica genome after divergence from arabidopsis. due to their high sequence similarity, we could not distinguish any separate clades for the brami- <dig> family members in the brassica species.

brami- <dig> insertion in genic regions of the b. rapa genome
we inspected the insertion sites of the  <dig> brami- <dig> elements in the b. rapa genome using the annotated b. rapa genome database  <cit> . the analysis showed that  <dig> members  were located in gene-rich regions, less than 3 kb from genes. among them,  <dig>  were inside the gene structure, specifically in introns, and  <dig>  were within less than 1 kb of a gene .

a distance from nearest gene.

we closely inspected the  <dig> genic insertions by comparing with their nips from triplicated chromosomal blocks. similar numbers of insertions were identified in tri-, di-, and mono-copy genes  indicating that multi-copy genes did not preferentially contain brami- <dig> insertions. comparison of genes containing the brami- <dig> insertion and their nips genes in the triplicated blocks revealed that all of the elements resided in intronic regions.

z the triplicated chromosome blocks are denoted according to the classification of the b. rapa genome annotation databases   <cit> . the triplicated chromosome blocks are classified as one least fractionized block  and two moderately fractionized blocks . genes with brami- <dig> insertion in introns are denoted in bold and their nips are denoted in plain letters.

for example, bra <dig> gene was annotated as having  <dig> exons and included the brami- <dig> insertion in the 7th intron. its two nips  and its arabidopsis ortholog  have similar structures in which the exonic regions share conserved sequences with bra <dig> . another gene, bra <dig>  which has the brami- <dig> insertion in 5th intron, showed conserved cds sequences without any change of gene structure compared to its nips  and its arabidopsis ortholog  .

transcriptional changes of b. rapa genes containing brami- <dig> insertions
even though most of the brami- <dig> insertions were found in introns or utrs, some modification of gene expression might still be mediated by brami- <dig>  therefore, we analyzed expression level changes by comparison to nips using a b. rapa microarray database. among the  <dig> multicopy genes with brami- <dig> insertions , only six were present along with their nips in the microarray database. of the six genes with brami- <dig> insertions, only bra <dig> showed similar expression to that of its nips, regardless of stress treatments. one gene, bra <dig>  showed decreased expression and four genes, bra <dig>  bra <dig>  bra <dig>  and bra <dig>  showed increased expression compared to that of their nips .

the expression of bra <dig>  which contains a brami- <dig> insertion, was severely decreased compared to that of its nips, bra <dig> and bra <dig>  under normal conditions and also under the four stress treatment conditions, indicating that bra <dig> gene expression was maintained at a very low level even though the brami- <dig> insertion did not affect exons . by contrast, expression of bra <dig>  with a brami- <dig> insertion, was more than 3-fold higher than expression of its nip bra <dig> under control and all four treatment conditions .

survey of mite insertion polymorphisms  and estimation of activation dates
to analyze brami-1’s transposition activity and insertion time, we designed  <dig> mip primers,  <dig> for b. rapa and  <dig> for b. oleracea, from the flanking regions of the brami- <dig> insertions, especially insertions in genic regions . the positions of the  <dig> b. rapa mips are denoted as arrows on the in silico map . almost all of the primer pairs revealed polymorphisms  among seven accessions belonging to three brassica species, indicating that the brami- <dig> members have been continuously activated during diversification of the brassica genome. moreover, there was high polymorphism within species, with seven , six , and ten  polymorphisms among two accessions of b. napus, two accessions of b. rapa, and three accessions of b. oleracea, respectively.

we grouped the  <dig> mips into three different groups: bs , br , and bo , to deduce the tentative insertion times . the br and bo mips were further classified into two subgroups, -i and –ii, based on the presence or absence of the insertion in their allopolyploid species b. napus. among the  <dig> b. rapa mips,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were bs, br-i, and br-ii type insertions, respectively, and among the  <dig> b. oleracea mips,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were bs, bo-i, and bo-ii types, respectively. overall, 18% were shared in the brassica genus, and 82% were species-unique insertions .

phylogenetic analysis based on the  <dig> mip profiles revealed four distinct clusters at the  <dig>  genetic similarity coefficient level . arabidopsis was separated from brassica accessions with a genetic similarity coefficient of  <dig> . three brassica species each formed a distinct cluster with two or three accessions belonging to each species, corresponding well with the phylogeny of brassica species. each mip reflects the insertion time at that genomic position and thus mip-based genotyping and phylogenetic analysis will be a good tool for study of genetic diversity in the brassica genus. we also confirmed that the mips are clearly distinguishable on agarose gels, heritable and reproducible, characteristics beneficial as dna markers. a mip between two b. oleracea accessions, bo- <dig>  segregated according to a normal mendelian 1: 2:  <dig> ratio in a survey of 94 f <dig> progeny of a cross between the two accessions .

discussion
structure, distribution and evolution of brami- <dig> in the b. rapa genome
brami- <dig> exhibits the basic characteristics of conventional stowaway-like mites, which include small size, tirs, and tsds, and also possesses a potential dna hairpin-like secondary structure. brami- <dig> elements have a highly conserved 33 bp tir region that is rich in a + t nucleotides  and a 194 bp internal region. in plants, most mites are classified as either tourist-like or stowaway-like. tourist-like mites are regarded as deletion derivatives of full-length autonomous tes, such as mping derived from pong and pif <cit> . the origin of stowaway-like mites is unclear due to the lack of sufficient sequence similarity to known autonomous tes  <cit> . however, numerous stowaway-like mites can be cross-mobilized by distantly related mariner-like elements  to generate high copy numbers  <cit> . however, we could not identify the trans-acting autonomous element for the brami- <dig> elements in this study.

rapid amplification of brami- <dig> elements in the brassica genus
the genus brassica is an excellent model plant to study polyploidization-mediated genome evolution because allotetraploid species like b. juncea, b. napus, and b. carinata evolved very recently from the three diploid species b. rapa, b. oleracea, and b. nigra, and even the diploid brassica species have triplicated genome features that arose approximately  <dig> million years ago   <cit> . the estimated copy numbers of the brami- <dig> elements were similar in two closely related brassica species:  <dig> and  <dig> in b. rapa and b. oleracea, respectively supporting that brami- <dig> elements were actively amplified in both brassica species  <cit> . this is the first mite found to exhibit very high copy numbers in brassica, although one medium copy number brassica stowaway mite, named brasto, was recently characterized  <cit> .

brami- <dig> shares 77% similarity with the a. thaliana mite attirta- <dig>  suggesting that they evolved from a common ancestor of the brassica and arabidopsis lineage. phylogenetic analysis revealed that attirta- <dig> and brami- <dig> elements have clearly different evolutionary histories. the attirta- <dig> elements showed a high amount of variation even though their copy numbers were small compared to those of the brami- <dig> members, indicating that the attirta- <dig> members were maintained in the arabidopsis genome without further amplification after the split from the brassica lineage 13– <dig> mya  <cit> . by contrast, members derived from b. rapa , b. oleracea , and b. napus  are highly conserved and interrelated with each other, demonstrating that the members were actively amplified in the brassica lineage after divergence from arabidopsis . this is consistent with a report showing highly active te amplification in b. oleracea <cit> . we assume that several transpositional bursts may have been responsible for the amplification of the brami- <dig> members in the brassica lineage  <cit> .

the putative role of brami- <dig> in b. rapa genome evolution
there have been many reports of mites involved in the evolution of genes and genomes. mites are often inserted in genic regions such as promoter regions, utrs, introns, or exons and can influence the expression of genes  <cit> . mite insertion into the various functional regions of a gene can modify its transcriptional activity, cause silencing, and up- or down-regulation of gene expression  <cit> . we found  <dig> brami- <dig> elements were dispersed across the whole genome . a total of  <dig> members  were identified in 177 mb of intergenic spaces and  <dig> members  were identified in 79 mb of gene spaces in the 256 mb b. rapa pseudo chromosome sequences. among the  <dig> elements,  <dig> members  were located within 3 kb of genic regions and all the  <dig> copies found in genic regions were resided in introns. the 33 mb intronic regions exhibited 65% a + t composition, which was much higher than that of 46 mb exonic regions . this insertion target site preference for non-coding sequences of genic regions is similar to the insertion preference of mping in rice, which is more often found in a + t rich non-coding sequence than in g + c rich exonic regions  <cit> .

we showed that brami- <dig> insertion might be one of the causal forces for modification of gene expression. when we compared the expressions of several genes harboring brami- <dig> within their genic regions with those of nips, most of the genes with brami- <dig> insertions showed different expression patterns than their nip counterparts . comparison of microsynteny between regions with brami- <dig> insertions and their non-insertion homologous genes in b. rapa and a. thaliana showed relatively conserved coding sequences but more sequence variation in introns and utrs, including from the brami- <dig> insertions . the observed changes in transcription levels might arise from brami- <dig> insertions into intronic or utr regions, similar to a recent report showing an enhancing effect of mping near rice genes  <cit> . further intensive study of whole transcriptome profiles will be necessary to address mite effects on gene expression.

brami- <dig> elements are active up to the present in brassica genera
mip patterns showing insertions specific to certain species or accessions elucidate the timing of insertion events. among  <dig> mips, nine  brami- <dig> elements were found in both b. rapa and b. oleracea, indicating that they were inserted into the regions before b. rapa and b. oleracea diverged from each other  <dig> mya  <cit> . the other  <dig>  were unique to one species or the other, indicating they were inserted after the divergence of the two lineages. among the  <dig> species-specific members, six  showed no insertion in b. napus  indicating that they inserted into each genome after allopolyplidization  <dig>  mya  <cit>  . some mips were found between accessions of same species, and the mips segregated normally in an f <dig> population, opening a new window for mip-based marker development for marker-assisted selection and other breeding applications in brassica crops. overall, the mips revealed that brami- <dig> elements were gradually inserted into the brassica genome during various events and remained active up to the present.

CONCLUSIONS
we characterized a high copy stowaway family mite, named as brami- <dig>  in three brassica crops and showed its putative role in the evolution of the highly duplicated brassica genome based on comparative genomics analysis. mip analysis revealed that the brami- <dig> elements were dispersed into whole brassica genome by gradual amplification. we also propose effective utilization of the elements as dna markers for breeding and evolution of duplicated genes.
