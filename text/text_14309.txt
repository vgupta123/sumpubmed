BACKGROUND
leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies. the leishmania parasite develops to an infective form inside the gut of the sandfly and is injected together with saliva into a mammalian host during blood feeding. components present in sandfly saliva, as well as in the saliva of other arthropod vectors, have been shown to contain potent anti-hemostatic and immunomodulatory activities  <cit> , and are able to enhance leishmania infection  <cit> . salivary proteins therefore are potential candidates for vaccines to control vector-borne diseases.

immune responses to either sandfly salivary gland homogenate  <cit>  or to the bites of sandflies  <cit>  have been shown to protect animals against leishmania infection. two molecules isolated from the saliva of sandflies have been shown to confer this protection, one named "maxadilan" is a vasodilatory and immunomodulatory molecule present in the saliva of lutzomyia longipalpis  <cit> , and the other called ppsp <dig>  is a molecule present in the saliva of phlebotomus papatasi  <cit> . maxadilan injected together with parasites was shown to enhance leishmania major infection in laboratory animals as compared to injection with leishmania major alone, and vaccination with maxadilan reversed this effect and protected animals against l. major infection  <cit> . animals vaccinated with ppsp <dig> salivary protein developed a strong delayed-type hypersensitivity response to this protein that was sufficient to protect them against l. major infection since b-cell deficient animals vaccinated with ppsp <dig> were also protected  <cit> .

the sand fly phlebotomus duboscqi is a proven vector of l. major in sub-saharan africa from ethiopia to senegal. it belongs to the subgenus phlebotomus together with p. papatas, p. bergeroti and p. salehii. electrophoretic profiles of salivary proteins of p. duboscqi eastern populations  differ from western ones   <cit> . cutaneous leishmaniasis has been reported in northwest and northeast mali and p. duboscqi was reported as the suspected vector  <cit> . until now there has been no information available concerning the repertoire of salivary proteins from this vector of disease, and the degree of intraspecific homogeneity present in the salivary proteins of conspecific specimens from two different geographic locations. in was previously reported that the salivary protein maxadilan, from the lutzomyia longipalpis sand fly, was highly variable, up to 23% differences in amino acid identity between different sandfly populations of sandfly colonies derived from brazil, colombia and costa rica  <cit> . it was hypothesised that this variability was due to antigenic polymorphism that ultimately would avoid the host immune response and therefore neutralisation of a salivary protein important in blood feeding  <cit> . in this work we studied the salivary gland transcriptomes of p. duboscqi from two different locations, mali and kenya to test the hypothesis that sandfly salivary proteins from two geographically distinct but conspecific populations are very divergent due to the immune pressure exerted by the mammalian host. moreover, the degree of similarity in the salivary proteins from a sand fly species originating from two different geographic locations was never investigated. knowledge of the latter is an important aspect of vaccine development, where target proteins should exhibit a degree of conservancy within the species across its distribution range to be viable vaccine candidates.

RESULTS
sequencing of two salivary gland cdna libraries collected in east and west africa
we constructed and sequenced two salivary gland cdna libraries from p. duboscqi collected in west africa  and east africa . the total number of high-quality sequences analysed from the mali cdna library was  <dig> and from the kenya cdna library the sequence total was  <dig>  the majority of the analysed transcripts from these two cdna libraries code for secreted proteins . p. duboscqi mali cdna library  resulted in  <dig>  % of transcripts coding for secreted proteins, 11% coding for housekeeping genes and  <dig>  % coding for proteins with no clear signal secretory peptide and with unknown function . similarly, p. duboscqi kenya cdna library  resulted in  <dig> % of transcripts coding for secreted proteins,  <dig>  % coding for housekeeping genes and  <dig> % coding for proteins with no clear signal secretory peptide and with unknown function . the high percentage of secreted proteins found on p. duboscqi salivary gland cdna library is similar to the ones observed in cdna libraries from other sandflies and mosquitoes  <cit> .

proteome analysis of salivary proteins from p. duboscqi from mali and kenya
edman degradation of the salivary proteins isolated from p. duboscqi mali strain resulted in the identification of  <dig> different n-terminal sequences . the transcripts coding for these n-terminal sequences were identified by searching the open reading frames of the transcripts from the constructed p. duboscqi cdna database . the identified proteins were two ppsp12-like proteins , two ppsp15-like protein , three d7-related protein , two apyrase-like proteins , a 32-kda protein from l. longipalpis , two yellow-related proteins  and two adenosine deaminase-like proteins . we also found proteins with the same n-terminal sequence but with different gel mobilities . these may represent the same protein with different post-translational modifications.

from p. duboscqi kenya salivary gland protein analysis we found  <dig> different nterminus sequences . the transcripts coding for these n-terminal sequences were identified by searching the p. duboscqi kenya cdna database . the identified proteins were: two ppsp12-like proteins , one ppsp15-like protein , four d7-related proteins , one apyrase-like protein , a 32-kda protein , three yellow-related proteins  and an adenosine deaminase-like protein .

phylogenetic tree analysis, multiple sequence alignment and identification of potential mhc class ii t-cell epitopes of p. duboscqi salivary proteins
to evaluate the phylogenetic relationship among these salivary proteins and provide a better assessment of the homology of secreted salivary proteins from these two different sandfly populations, we performed sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis of the most abundant and secreted proteins from the mali and kenya cdna libraries. the objective of this analysis was to identify and compare the orthologues between these two geographically distant sandfly species. because cellular immune responses to salivary proteins, particularly cd <dig> t cell-dependent response, are associated with protection against leishmania infection, we searched for putative mhc class ii t cell epitopes in these salivary proteins and compared how conserved these epitopes were between the salivary orthologues of the two sandfly populations.

following is a description of the analysis of these salivary proteins:

ppsp14-like proteins
ppsp14-like proteins are related to the 14-kda salivary proteins of unknown function from p. papatasi and also identified in other sandflies, but not in other insects  <cit> . we found three members of this family of proteins  on the cdna library of p. duboscqi mali strain and two members  in the kenya strain. phylogenetic tree analysis of these salivary proteins resulted in the formation of three distinct clades, one containing pdum <dig> and pduk <dig>  the second containing ppsp <dig> and pdum <dig>  and the third containing pduk <dig> and pdum <dig> . pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> is a cluster of orthologous sequences  as well as pdum <dig> and pduk <dig>  when comparing the number of transcripts among these orthologues, pduk <dig> has  <dig> transcripts and pdum <dig> has only eight transcripts, overall, these sequences contained more  or fewer  sequences from a particular value than expected from a random distribution, as evaluated by the χ <dig> test, this suggests that this transcript/protein may be more represented in the kenya population than in the mali population. pduk <dig> has ten transcripts and pdum <dig> has five transcripts, which may suggest that these transcripts/proteins may be represented in similar proportions in these two populations. pdum <dig> may be a transcript/protein present only in the mali population or rarely in the kenya population. sequence comparison of these orthologues resulted in a  <dig> % identity between pdum <dig> and pduk <dig>  and  <dig> % identity between pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> . because cellular immune responses  to sandfly proteins are related to protection against leishmania infection, we wanted to identify potential mhc class ii-restricted epitopes in these salivary proteins and determine whether these epitopes were conserved when comparing two different sandfly populations. we identified an epitope in pdum <dig>  vvtankknq , which is 100% identical in pduk <dig>  the epitope for pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> is ikynvvaakkrge , which is also 100% identical.

ppsp15-like proteins
immunisation of mice with ppsp <dig> protein or dna plasmid coding for this protein from the saliva of p. papatasi was previously shown to protect mice against l. major infection  <cit> . three members of the ppsp15-like family were identified in each sandfly cdna library, pdum <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> from the mali cdna library and pduk <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> from the kenya cdna library. phylogenetic tree analysis of these proteins resulted in the formation of three distinct groups . two groups with single members including ppsp <dig> and pduk <dig>  a group with three members – including a cluster of orthologous sequences pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> – and the third group that includes the orthologues pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> . in the third group, pduk <dig> is highly represented in this library  as compared with pdum <dig> , overall, these sequences contained more  or fewer  sequences from a particular value than expected from a random distribution, as evaluated by the χ <dig> test, thus, this suggest that this protein is more frequent in the kenya population than in the mali population. when orthologues were compared, we observed a 100% identity between pdum <dig> and pduk <dig>  and 100% identity between pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> . using tepitope software on these sequences we identified two potential mhc class ii t-cell epitopes in pdum <dig>  ygfidvnyn and yrcvltskl . two potential t-cell epitopes were found in pdum <dig>  likhgvvei and wlncrsivd .

ppsp12-like proteins
this family of proteins was previously described in the salivary glands of p. papatasi and is a protein of  <dig> kda with unknown function  <cit> . transcripts with homologies to this protein were also found in the two sandfly cdna libraries in the present work. interestingly, this family of proteins had many members that were unlike the other salivary proteins in this sandfly in either location. for the mali population we identified eight members, pdum <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and for the kenya strain six members were identified, pduk <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  phylogenetic tree analysis resulted in the formation of  <dig> major clades , one clade containing ppsp <dig> and two orthologues pdum <dig> and pduk <dig>  a second clade containing the orthologues pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> and a third clade containing a rapidly diverging salivary proteins, including various clusters of orthologous sequences such as pdum <dig> and pduk <dig>  pdum <dig> and pduk <dig>  pdum <dig> and pduk <dig>  pdum <dig> and pduk <dig>  and pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> . sequence comparison between the different sp12-like orthologues resulted in a high level of identity among these proteins . pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> were  <dig>  % identical and the predicted t-cell epitopes  were 100% identical; pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> were  <dig> % identical and the predicted t-cell epitopes were 89% identical ; pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> were  <dig> % identical ; pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> were 97% identical and the predicted t cell epitope was 100% identical ; pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> were  <dig>  % identical and the predicted t cell epitope was 75% identical; pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> were 93% identical and the predicted t-cell epitope was 100% identical.

d7-like proteins 
transcripts with homology to the d <dig> family of proteins were identified in both cdna libraries. d <dig> protein was previously reported in mosquitoes  <cit>  and sandflies  <cit> . only recently has its function been described from the saliva of anopheles mosquito as a anti-clotting factor  <cit> , and as a serotonin and small amine-binding protein  <cit> . phylogenetic tree analysis of d <dig> proteins from various sandflies, including transcripts from mali and kenya, resulted in the formation of six different clades. three clades are clusters of orthologous sequences that include ppesp <dig>  and parsp <dig> , ppsp <dig>  and pduk <dig> and a third cluster containing pdum <dig> and pduk <dig>  sequence comparison from the orthologues pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> showed 100% sequence identity and sharing of three potential t cell epitopes .

sp32-like proteins
this protein family belongs to the silk-related and collagen-like protein in sandflies  <cit> . this type of protein has not been described in other blood feeding arthropods, yet it is present in the phlebotomus as well as in the lutzomyia sandflies  <cit> . these proteins are characterised by a large number of low complexity amino acids such as glycine , arginine , proline  and serine , throughout the molecule . phylogenetic tree analysis of various sp32-like proteins from different sandflies, including p. duboscqi mali and kenya, resulted in the formation of various clades . three of these clades are clusters of orthologues sequences: the first clade contains pdum <dig> and pduk <dig>  the second clade contains pdum <dig> and pduk <dig>  and the third clade contains pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> . sequence comparison between the sp32-like orthologues from kenya and mali resulted in a high degree of homology . pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> had  <dig> % sequence identity; additionally, two of the three potential t-cell epitopes  are  <dig> % identical . pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> are  <dig>  % identical and the two potential tcell epitopes  are 100% identical . pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> are 84% identical, one potential t cell epitope  is  <dig> % identical and the other two potential t cell epitopes  are 89% identical .

antigen 5-related protein
this family of proteins belongs to the cysteine rich family of proteins  found in wasp venom  <cit> , hookworm  <cit> , mosquitoes  <cit>  and sandflies  <cit> . we found transcripts coding for this family of proteins in the p. duboscqi salivary gland cdna libraries from mali and kenya. phylogenetic tree analysis of antigen 5-related proteins from various sandflies, including the antigen 5-related proteins from p. duboscqi , resulted in the formation of various clades – one of them containing the orthologues pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> from mali and kenya . sequence comparison of these orthologues resulted in 100% identity, including two potential t-cell epitopes .

apyrase-like protein
transcripts were found on the p. duboscqi mali and kenya cdna libraries coding for a protein homologous to the cimex family of apyrases  <cit> , a protein also present in other organisms including sandflies  <cit> , worms, mouse and humans  <cit> . secreted apyrases function as potent anti-platelet factors by hydrolysing the platelet activator adenosine diphosphate . phylogenetic tree analysis of apyrase-like proteins from different sandflies resulted in the identification of the apyrase-like orthologues pduk <dig> and pdum <dig> from the two cdna salivary gland libraries . the phylogenetic tree also shows that the apyrase-like proteins from p. duboscqi are closely related to p. papatasi apyrases and apart from other phlebotomus and lutzomyia apyrases. sequence comparison between the mali and kenya orthologues shows a high degree of identity,  <dig> %, between these two proteins . of interest, we observed five potential epitopes in this molecule, almost twice the number of epitopes identified from the other sandfly proteins. four of these epitopes are 100% identical when comparing apyrase epitopes from mali and kenya proteins .

yellow-related proteins
we identified in the p. duboscqi mali cdna library  <dig> transcripts  and in the kenya cdna library  <dig> transcripts  coding for a yellow related protein, a protein previously described in the saliva of p. duboscqi  <cit> , other sand flies  <cit>  and other insects <cit> . volf et al.  <cit>  reported lectin activity of  <dig> kda yellow-related protein purified from p. duboscqi lysates. however, the function of this protein in the saliva of insects remains unknown. notably, a homologous protein was purified from aedes aegypti midgut having a dopa decarboxylase activity  <cit> ; this activity in the saliva of sandflies remains to be tested. phylogenetic tree analysis of yellow-related proteins from different sandflies, including mali and kenya, resulted in the formation of five different clades . clusters of othologous sequences for the mali and kenya strain were found in the first two clusters, one containing the orthologues pduk <dig> and pdum <dig>  and the other containing pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> . sequence comparison of pduk <dig> and pdum <dig> resulted in  <dig> % identity  and in 100% identity in the two potential t-cell epitopes identified . sequence comparison of pdum <dig> and pduk <dig> resulted in  <dig> % identity, including the two t-cell epitopes identified .

CONCLUSIONS
salivary transcriptome and proteome analysis of p. duboscqi has resulted in a better understanding at the molecular level of the repertoire of proteins present in the saliva of this sandfly . most salivary transcripts identified from the p. duboscqi cdna libraries are very similar to those of the salivary proteins previously identified in p. papatasi. this is not surprising, because both p. papatasi and p. duboscqi belong to the same subgenus  and are proven natural vectors of l. major. a clear difference between p. duboscqi and p. papatasi cdna libraries was the presence in p. duboscqi of an adenosine deaminase . adenosine deaminase has been reported in aedes and culex mosquitoes  <cit>  and in the sandfly l. longipalpis; however, not in sandflies from the genus phlebotomus  <cit> .

this salivary transcriptome analysis allowed us to compare the salivary proteins of a sandfly from two different geographical locations. we investigated whether the salivary proteins from two different sites  would be divergent, as previously reported with the salivary protein maxadilan when comparing l. longipalpis sandflies from costa rica, colombia, and brazil  <cit> . in the present work, we performed a global comparative analysis of the most abundant salivary proteins of sandflies from two locations, and searched for orthologues using phylogenetic analysis. we found the majority of the proteins to be highly conserved at both the aa and the nucleotide levels. we found that at least five families of proteins  were 100% identical in sandflies from mali and kenya. the other families were also highly conserved  with the exception of three proteins that had moderate homology : two sp12-like members that were  <dig> % and  <dig> % identical, respectively, and a sp32-like member that was 84% identical.

because cellular immune responses to sandfly saliva – particularly a dth response – was previously associated with protection against leishmania infection  <cit> , we wanted first to identify potential mhc class ii t-cell epitopes, which are required for dth t cell-dependent responses and then determine whether these putative epitopes were also conserved among salivary proteins from these sandflies. the majority of potential t-cell epitopes were highly conserved among the different sandfly proteins; in fact, the majority of potential t cell epitopes were 100% identical, with the exception of only five epitopes that were 75% to 90% identical. these data suggest that even if the overall level of identity of some salivary proteins  is not 100%, the proteins have the potential to cross-react, at least at the level of cellular immune response  because of the high conservation of their t-cell epitopes that can be presented in the proper mhc class ii context. this assumption needs to be tested experimentally.

a possible explanation for the conservation of salivary proteins include recent establishment of these sandflies in these regions with little or no evolutionary pressure from host immune response on these salivary proteins; or evolutionary pressure to keep these sequences constant . additionally, the location of these sand flies is more than  <dig> thousand of kilometers apart. then, it is difficult to suggest that there is a continuous exchange of sand flies in the whole sub-saharan africa moving from kenya all the way to mali or is also possible that the gene flow may be very low. in history, this area was affected by dramatic aridization   <cit>  and consequent creation of sahel as a unique transient formation   <cit> , events that might led to separation and later rejoining of eastern and western populations of p. duboscqi. further studies are needed to determine if these two populations are genetically isolated.

a dth response to p. papatasi bites in mice was experimentally demonstrated to help these sandflies to probe and feed faster  <cit> . it was shown that this type of response considerably increased blood flow at the site of the bite , creating a favorable environment for feeding. it is thus possible that this type of immune response may favor sandfly survival in nature and therefore will also favor the presence of highly conserved sequences in their salivary proteins.

the data presented in this work are in contrast to previous studies performed with the salivary protein maxadilan from the sandfly l. longipalpis, which was shown to be highly divergent between sandflies of distinct locations  <cit> . in contrast, ppsp <dig> from p. papatasi was shown to be highly conserved when comparing sandflies from different locations and isolates from field and laboratory colonies  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that phlebotomus salivary proteins are more conserved in general than proteins present in the saliva of lutzomyia sandflies, perhaps due to the benefit accrued in increased feeding due to the host dth response. it is also important to take into account that l. longipalpis is allegedly a complex of cryptic species  <cit> , hence the larger variability observed in their salivary protein. additionally, if p. duboscqi is a much older sand fly than l. longipalpis, it may be possible that phlebotomus sand flies are more stable species which could explain the high conservancy of salivary proteins in the two different phlebotomus species .

sandfly salivary components are potential vaccine candidates to control leishmania infection. our results suggest that p. duboscqi salivary protein that may be able to produce a protective cellular immune response should be able to induce the same immune response in hosts from distant geographical locations in the sub-saharan africa where p. duboscqi is present.
