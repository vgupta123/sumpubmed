BACKGROUND
type ii topoisomerases are essential nuclear enzymes found in all living organisms  <cit> . their basic role in cells is to catalyse the transport of one dna double helix through a transient double strand break in another dna molecule  <cit> . this activity helps relieve tensions built up in dna during various dna metabolic processes such as dna replication, chromosome condensation and de-condensation, chromosome segregation and transcription  <cit> .

topoisomerase ii is also a major drug target in human cancer therapy, where a number of clinically active drugs such as the epipodophyllotoxins vp- <dig> and vm- <dig>  the aminoacridine m-amsa, and antracyclines such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin and epirubicin are widely used. these drugs have collectively been called topoisomerase ii poisons due to their mechanism of action on topoisomerase ii. rather than inhibiting the basic catalytic activity of the enzyme, these drugs perturb the topoisomerase ii catalytic cycle resulting in an increase in the level of a transient reaction intermediate, where dna is cleaved and covalently attached to dna  <cit> .

catalytic inhibitors of topoisomerase ii have a different mode of action. these drugs exemplified by merbarone, aclarubicin, f <dig> and the bisdioxopiperazines work by inhibiting topoisomerase ii at other stages in the reaction cycle where dna is not cleaved as reviewed in  <cit> . amongst these, the bisdioxopiperazines have gained much attention due to their distinct and well-characterised mode of action. these compounds exemplified by icrf- <dig>  icrf- <dig> and icrf- <dig> inhibit the dna strand passage reaction of topoisomerase ii by sequestering this protein as a salt-stable closed clamp on dna whose formation depends on the presence of atp  <cit> . this closed clamp complex has retained the capability to hydrolyse atp, although at a reduced level  <cit> .

several studies indicate that the closed clamp complex on dna represents a novel form of dna lesion to cells, – and that inhibition of topoisomerase ii catalytic activity  is not responsible for bisdioxopiperazine-induced cell kill:  expression of bisdioxopiperazine-sensitive topoisomerase ii in cells also expressing bisdioxopiperazine-resistant topoisomerase ii confers dominant sensitivity to these drugs  <cit>  – a modality reminiscent of that of topoisomerase ii poisons.  mouse embryonic stem cells  <cit>  and chicken lymphoma dt <dig> cells  <cit>  having one topoisomerase ii α allele knocked out with concomitant reduced levels of topoisomerase ii, are resistant to both icrf- <dig> and the topoisomerase ii poison etoposide, – while the opposite result is to be expected if icrf- <dig> kill cells by depriving them of essential topoisomerase ii catalytic activity.  killing of yeast cells by exposure to icrf- <dig> occurs more rapidly and to a higher level than killing of yeast cells induced by the depletion of endogenous topoisomerase ii catalytic activity  <cit> .  the icrf-193-induced topoisomerase ii closed clamp complexes on dna work as a "road block" signalling selective degradation of topoisomerase ii β as well as p <dig> activation in a transcription dependent fashion  <cit> .

some studies have recorded elevated levels of dna breaks in cells after exposure to the bisdioxopiperazine analog icrf- <dig>  in one study, icrf- <dig> was found to increase the level of topoisomerase ii-dna covalent complexes in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . however, in this study efficient trapping of this covalent intermediate was only evident when guanidine was used to denature topoisomerase ii attracted to dna, while the agent normally used to trap the topoisomerase ii-dna cleavage complex, sds, was not effective. in another study, the comet assay and pulsed field gel electrophoresis were used to demonstrate elevated levels of dna breaks in mammalian cells after exposure to icrf- <dig>  <cit> . in this study, inhibiting dna replication with aphidicolin reduced the level of dna breaks induced by the topoisomerase ii poison m-amsa, but had no effect on dna breaks induced by icrf- <dig>  these results point towards bisdioxopiperazines poisoning dna topoisomerase ii in cells by a mechanism different from that of the classical topoisomerase ii poisons such as etoposide and m-amsa. in a recent paper, it was directly demonstrated that m-amsa-induced dominant cytotoxicity only required the dna cleavage activity of topoisomerase ii, while dominant cytotoxicity towards icrf- <dig> depended strictly on the dna strand passage reaction of the enzyme <cit> .

based on these observations, the present study aims to further elucidate the mechanism of cytotoxicity induced by the bisdioxopiperazines. we here characterise the effect of the clinically approved analog icrf- <dig>  by using a number of different cell-based pharmacological assays, taking advantage of genetically modified yeast and mammalian cells.

RESULTS
icrf- <dig> sensitivity of yeast cells depends on their homologous recombination status, albeit to a lesser extent than for m-amsa sensitivity
to pinpoint the mechanism of cytotoxicity of icrf- <dig> versus m-amsa, we employed a panel of human topoisomerase ii α-transformed haploid single-gene knockout yeast strains, defective in various aspects of dna repair, checkpoint control, membrane transport and protein degradation. all yeast strains are depicted in table  <dig>  we used doses of these two drugs equitoxic to wild-type cells having no mutations. clonogenic survival of all yeast strains is depicted in additional file  <dig>  and the degree of drug resistance / hypersensitivity is also listed in table  <dig> 

r : cells are more than a 1/ <dig> log resistant at any drug concentration.

 <dig> : cells are no more than a 1/ <dig> log resistant and no more than a 1/ <dig> log hypersensitive at any drug concentration.

+ : cells are at least a 1/ <dig> log but no more than  <dig> log hypersensitive at any concentration.

++ : cells are more than  <dig> log hypersensitive at any concentration.

hypersensitivity  was graduated as follows

the products of the three genes rad <dig>  mre <dig> and xrs <dig> together form the rad50/mre11/xrs <dig> hetero-trimer protein complex that has catalytic and structural functions in many kinds of dna metabolic processes including hr as reviewed in  <cit> . we observed that Δrad <dig>  Δmre <dig>  and Δxrs <dig> single knockout strains were extremely hypersensitive towards m-amsa, while they displayed considerably less hypersensitivity towards icrf- <dig> .

we also tested the effect of deleting a number of genes exclusively involved in hr namely rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig>  dmc <dig> and sae <dig>  <cit> . deleting rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig> and sae <dig> had a profound effect on the sensitivity of the yeast cells towards m-amsa while having a smaller, but significant, effect on the sensitivity of these cells towards icrf- <dig> , again pointing to the hr pathway as being most important for the repair of dna damage caused by cleavage complex stabilising drugs. we found that deleting rad <dig> had no effect on drug sensitivity, confirming reported data that rad <dig> only becomes functionally important in the absence of functional rad <dig> protein  <cit> . we also observed no effect of deleting dmc <dig> . this may be explained by the fact that dmc1p is primarily involved in meiotic recombination  <cit> .

nhej represents another dna repair-pathway. in yeast, this repair pathway is generally less important than hr for the repair of dna breaks  <cit> . in accordance with this we observed no effect of deleting the nhej genes yku <dig> and yku <dig> on the sensitivity towards m-amsa. we did however, observe some hypersensitivity of Δyku <dig> cells towards icrf- <dig>  while Δyku <dig> cells were not hypersensitive . this is a surprising result, because yku70p and yku80p have been demonstrated to play equally important roles for nhej activity in yeast  <cit> . these results suggest that the effect of deleting yku <dig> is unrelated to its dna repair functions.

the dna binding rad18p forms a hetero-dimer with rad6p that is involved in post replication repair   <cit> . we found that although Δrad <dig> cells were clearly hypersensitive towards m-amsa, Δrad <dig> cells were markedly more sensitive. Δrad <dig> cells were actually among the most sensitive towards m-amsa . interestingly, the sensitivity of Δrad <dig> and Δrad <dig> cells towards icrf- <dig> is indistinguishable from that of wild-type cells . the vast difference in the sensitivity of Δrad <dig> cells towards icrf- <dig> and m-amsa confirms the notion that the dna lesions induced by these drugs are different in nature. the finding that Δrad <dig> cells are much more sensitive towards m-amsa than Δrad <dig> cells is surprising, and may indicate that rad6p functions unrelated to dna repair affect cellular sensitivity towards m-amsa. rad6p has ubiquitin conjugating activity  <cit> , and therefore such rad18p-unrelated functions could involve protein degradation via the 26s proteasome pathway. to test this hypothesis, we analysed the drug sensitivity of four yeast strains with impaired protein degradation; Δubc <dig>  Δubc <dig>  Δdoa <dig> and Δqri <dig>  these deletion strains were not hypersensitive towards m-amsa  , suggesting that Δrad <dig> cells are hypersensitive towards m-amsa due to impaired prr activity. the involvement of both hr repair and prr in determining the sensitivity of yeast cells towards the topoisomerase ii cleavage complex stabilising drugs mitoxantrone and idarubicin has previously been reported  <cit> . the observed lack of hypersensitivity of the Δrev <dig> and Δrev <dig> strains  suggests that trans-lesion dna synthesis plays no role in determining the sensitivity towards icrf- <dig> or m-amsa.

we also analysed the effect of deleting genes belonging to the nucleotide excision repair  pathway – rad <dig> and rad <dig>  the base excision repair  pathway – apn <dig>  and the mismatch repair  pathway – mlh <dig>  pms <dig>  msh <dig> and msh <dig>  none of these deletions caused cells to become more sensitive towards icrf- <dig> and m-amsa, indicating that these pathways are not involved in repairing dna damage induced by these drugs. interestingly, deleting genes involved in the mmr and ner pathways caused cells to become somewhat resistant to icrf- <dig>  and to a lesser extent towards m-amsa . the products of these genes have been implicated to have anti-recombination activities  <cit> . increased levels of recombination in these cells could therefore be responsible for the observed low-level resistance towards icrf- <dig> 

deletion of dna damage checkpoint genes has little effect on both icrf- <dig> and m-amsa sensitivity of yeast cells
while deleting genes involved in dna repair caused cells to be hypersensitive towards both drugs tested, we observed little effect of deleting the dna damage checkpoint genes mec <dig>  ddc <dig>  rad <dig>  tel <dig>  rad <dig> and chk <dig> . our finding that checkpoint control regulation plays no important role for bisdioxopiperazine sensitivity supports earlier data showing that arresting yeast cells in g <dig> phase did not protect against icrf- <dig> cytotoxicity  <cit> . the lack of importance of checkpoint function in determining sensitivity towards m-amsa is also in accordance with published observations  <cit> , where sensitivity towards the cleavage complex stabilising topoisomerase ii poisons mitoxantrone, idarubicin, daunorubicin and doxorubicin were only marginally affected by inactivating the rad <dig>  rad <dig>  mec <dig>  and rad <dig> genes, while the sensitivity of yeast cells towards the topoisomerase i poison camptothecin showed a strong dependency on these pathways.

icrf- <dig> is a possible substrate for the pdr <dig> abc transporter in yeast
in mammalian cells resistance towards various structurally-unrelated anti-neoplastic agents is often associated with over-expression of abc-type drug efflux transporters such as p-glycoprotein and multi-drug resistance protein  as reviewed in  <cit> . among the three yeast abc transporters assessed in our study, pdr <dig> is by far the best characterised  <cit> . while deleting yor <dig> and atr <dig> had no effect on drug sensitivity, Δpdr <dig> cells were clearly hypersensitive towards icrf- <dig> but not towards m-amsa , suggesting that icrf- <dig> is a substrate for the pdr <dig> pump in yeast. it has to be emphasized, that over-expression of drug efflux pumps has not been associated with resistance towards bisdioxopiperazines in mammalian cells.

transcriptional profiling of yeast cells after exposure to equitoxic concentrations of icrf- <dig> and m-amsa
in order to assess the effect on global gene expression of the interaction between human topoisomerase ii α and the two drugs in yeast cells, transcriptional profiling was performed using affymetrix gene chip technology. we exposed pmj1-transformed jn362at2– <dig> yeast cells expressing human topoisomerase ii α as their sole active topoisomerase ii to equitoxic doses of icrf- <dig> and m-amsa for two hours at 34°c. this treatment resulted in a  <dig> % reduction in clonogenic survival after exposure to both drugs . genes whose average expression in two independent experiments was up- or down-regulated more than  <dig>  fold by exposure to the drugs were filtered out.  <dig> transcripts were induced by exposure to icrf- <dig> while the number was  <dig> for m-amsa.  <dig> transcripts were repressed by exposure to icrf- <dig> while the number was  <dig> for m-amsa. additional file  <dig> lists transcripts induced or repressed by icrf- <dig> while additional file  <dig> lists transcripts induced or repressed by m-amsa. the expression profile of selected genes is listed in table  <dig> and discussed below.

genes induced by both drugs
both compounds induced the expression of a number of genes known to be up-regulated by dna damage. the expression of four well-established dna-damage inducible genes; rnr <dig>  rnr <dig>  <cit>  and rad <dig>  rad <dig>  <cit>  was thus induced by both drugs. both compounds also stimulated the expression of hug <dig> recently shown to be up-regulated by dna damage and replication arrest  <cit>  . furthermore, both drugs stimulated expression of the stress-inducible xbp <dig> gene whose protein product is a transcription factor. xbp <dig> expression is reportedly induced in response to heat shock, high osmolarity, oxidative stress, glucose starvation and dna damage, and induces a slow-growth phenotype with lengthening of the g <dig> cell cycle phase  <cit> . the pcl <dig> gene product has cyclin-dependent protein kinase regulator activity suggesting a role for pcl9p in cell cycle regulation  <cit> . repression of pcl <dig> by exposure to both drugs  may thus be indicative of drug-induced cell cycle arrest in accordance with the xbp <dig> expression data. finally, both drugs induced the expression of general stress-induced hsp genes as expected . although expression of the rnr <dig> and hug <dig> genes was up-regulated by both drugs, pmj1-transformed cells having rnr <dig> or sml <dig> deleted  have wild-type sensitivity towards both drugs , showing that although these genes are induced by both drugs, they are probably not involved in determining their cytotoxicity.

genes specifically induced by icrf-187
we found that icrf- <dig> specifically induced the expression of two genes encoding the abc efflux transporters pdr <dig> and pdr <dig>  while m-amsa had no effect on the expression of these genes . transcription of the stress-inducible wsc <dig> gene was likewise enhanced by exposure to icrf- <dig> . knocking out wsc <dig> in yeast cells has been found to enhance their sensitivity towards various stresses including heat, ethanol and dna damage  <cit> . recently, the swi/snf complex was directly shown to repress transcription in s. cerevisiae cells  <cit> . we found that swi <dig> was specifically induced by icrf- <dig> . finally, we found that icrf- <dig> specifically repressed the expression of the stationary phase-induced snz <dig> gene  <cit>  .

exposure of yeast cells to icrf- <dig> causes less transcriptional induction of dna damage-inducible genes than exposure to m-amsa at equitoxic drug concentrations
to verify the array data we performed real-time pcr to assess the expression of the rnr <dig>  hug <dig>  rad <dig> and rad <dig> genes after exposure to the two drugs using the actin gene act <dig> as internal control . real-time pcr confirmed induction of these established dna damage-inducible genes by both drugs assessed. furthermore, exposure of the cells to m-amsa resulted in a higher level of induction than did exposure to icrf- <dig> for the four genes tested, especially for hug <dig>  these data suggest that when yeast cells are exposed to equitoxic concentrations of the two drugs, m-amsa generates more extensive dna damage than icrf- <dig> 

icrf- <dig> sensitivity of mammalian hamster cells depends on their homologous recombination status, albeit to a lesser extent than seen for m-amsa sensitivity
the yeast clonogenic assays presented above point to an important role of hr in the repair of m-amsa-induced dna damage, while the importance of this pathway in the repair of icrf-187-induced dna damage is less so. because hr is the major repair pathway in yeast  <cit> , while both nhej and hr are important for the repair of dna breaks in mammalian cells  <cit> , we next turned to assess the importance of these pathways in mammalian cells having reduced levels of hr and nhej. in this analysis we used a panel of four hamster cell lines; aa <dig> cells , irs1sf cells  <cit>  , cxr <dig> cells  <cit>  , and v3- <dig> cells  <cit>  .

we observed a strong dependence on hr for the sensitivity towards m-amsa . thus, only  <dig> % relative survival was seen for the irs1sf cells  at  <dig> nm of this drug, while wild-type aa <dig> cells were only slightly sensitive to <dig> nm m-amsa. furthermore, ectopic expression of human xrcc <dig> fully reversed the m-amsa hypersensitivity as cxr <dig> cells were no more hypersensitive than aa <dig> wild-type cells, confirming the notion that hr plays a role in the repair of topoisomerase ii-induced dna breaks in mammalian cells. we also observed that irs1sf cells were hypersensitive towards icrf- <dig> , but the degree of hypersensitivity was much less than observed for m-amsa, as also seen for recombination deficient yeast cells. again, ectopic expression of the human xrcc <dig> homolog reversed the hypersensitivity as cxr <dig> cells displayed near wild-type sensitivity towards icrf- <dig> 

dna-pkcs deficient hamster cells show slightly increased sensitivity towards both m-amsa and icrf-187
to assess the effect of nhej on drug sensitivity we also employed the v3- <dig> cell line . the results of these experiments are depicted in figure 3a and 3b. the v3- <dig> cells were slightly hypersensitive towards both drugs suggesting a role for nhej in the repair of dna lesions induced by both drugs.

aa <dig>  irs1sf, cxr <dig> and v3- <dig> cells have similar levels of topoisomerase ii catalytic activity
the sensitivity of cells towards topoisomerase ii directed drugs depends both on their levels of topoisomerase ii catalytic activity, and on their capability to repair topoisomerase ii-induced dna damage. we therefore determined the level of topoisomerase ii catalytic  activity in crude protein extracts isolated from the four cell lines used in clonogenic assays, by applying a radioactive decatenation assay. no significant difference in the level of topoisomerase ii dna strand passage activity was recorded between the four cell lines . this result rules out the possibility that varying levels of topoisomerase ii catalytic activity in these cells is responsible for their differential drug sensitivity.

icrf- <dig> induces lower levels of homologous recombination in hamster cells than m-amsa at equitoxic concentrations
the hypersensitivity of the recombination defective irs1sf cells towards both drugs suggests that hr is involved in repairing dna lesions induced by both drugs. to address this directly we applied a mammalian recombination assay to measure stimulation of hr by icrf- <dig> and m-amsa by using spd <dig> hamster cells  <cit> . this assay measures the repair of a defective chromosomal hprt gene by the activity of hr. from figure 4a it is evident that both drugs stimulated the level of hr in a dose dependent manner. when recombination frequency is expressed as a function of surviving cells  it becomes evident that the recombination frequency increases with increasing cell mortality for both drugs tested. from figure 4c it is also evident that at equitoxic concentrations of the two drugs, m-amsa stimulated hr to much higher levels than did icrf- <dig>  thus, at  <dig> % survival, no induction of hr was seen with icrf- <dig> , while m-amsa caused an approximately 10-fold induction at equitoxic doses.

icrf- <dig> induces only low levels of h2ax phosphorylation in human sclc cells as compared to m-amsa
induction of γh2ax is a well-established marker for topoisomerase-induced dna double strand breaks in mammalian cells  <cit> . we therefore assessed the effect of exposing human sclc oc-nyh cells to  <dig> μm m-amsa and  <dig> mm of icrf- <dig> at increasing time points . exposure to  <dig> μm m-amsa quickly resulted in γh2ax induction. thus, induction was evident after  <dig> min, and after  <dig> hours more than 10-fold induction was observed. in contrast, when cells were exposed to  <dig> mm icrf- <dig>  much less γh2ax induction was observed, and after  <dig> hours the level of induction was less that three-fold.

discussion
we initiated the study by assessing the clonogenic sensitivity of yeast single-gene deletion mutants ectopically expressing human topoisomerase ii α towards m-amsa and icrf- <dig>  the results presented in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig> indicates that hr plays a role in the repair of icrf-187-induced dna damage. previous studies addressing the bisdioxopiperazine sensitivity of yeast cells have generated different results. in one study rad52-cells had the same sensitivity towards icrf- <dig> and icrf- <dig> as did rad52+ cells  <cit> , while in other studies, hr deficient cells were found to be hypersensitive towards bisdioxopiperazines, although to a much lesser extent than towards topoisomerase ii cleavage complex stabilising drugs  <cit> . our present study involving numerous other genes involved in various aspects of hr clearly establishes this pathway as being a functional determinant for bisdioxopiperazine sensitivity in yeast cells. in a recent work by simon and colleagues, where a panel of yeast deletion strains was also applied to pinpoint the mechanism of action of various anticancer drugs, a given drug was classified as selective if one single pathway was mainly involved in determining cellular sensitivity  <cit> . the selective involvement of the hr pathway in determining the sensitivity towards icrf- <dig> classifies this drug as highly selective according to this definition. however, it is important to note that although hr clearly does play a role in protecting yeast cells from icrf- <dig> cytotoxicity, the importance of this pathway on cell survival in the presence of m-amsa is much greater  – in accordance with this drug being a topoisomerase ii poison killing cells solely by the generation of topoisomerase ii-mediated dna breaks.

we find that the relative sensitivity of aa <dig>  irs1sf, and cxr <dig> cells towards m-amsa  closely resembles their sensitivity towards etoposide  <cit> , showing that the hypersensitivity of xrcc <dig> deficient irs1sf cells is general to topoisomerase ii poisons, suggesting a role for hr in the repair of topoisomerase ii-induced dna breaks in these cells. the involvement of hr in the repair of dna lesions induced by topoisomerase ii poisons in higher eukaryotes is also supported by a recent work suggesting that rad <dig> plays an important role in the repair of etoposide-induced dna damage in human small cell lung cancer cells  <cit> , and by work by adachi and colleagues who recently found that knocking out rad <dig> in chicken dt <dig> cells enhances their sensitivity towards the topoisomerase ii poison etoposide  <cit> .

we find that xrcc <dig> defective irs1sf cells are more sensitive towards icrf- <dig> than the parental aa <dig> cells, although the xrcc <dig> defect has a much more pronounced effect on m-amsa sensitivity  – as seen with the yeast deletion mutant panel. adachi and colleagues have found that knocking out rad <dig> in dt <dig> chicken cells does not increase sensitivity towards icrf- <dig>  <cit> . the reason for this discrepancy in not clear. the difference observed between the dt <dig> and irs1sfcells may relate to the fact that different dna repair genes are deleted in the two cell lines possibly resulting in different processing of bisdioxopiperazine-induced dna damage. in any case, this discrepancy does not challenge the overall finding that hr plays a more important role in protecting cells of various origin from cytotoxicity induced by topoisomerase ii poisons as compared to cytotoxicity induced by bisdioxopiperazines.

to study the importance of nhej in determining the sensitivity towards m-amsa and icrf- <dig> we employed a dna-pkcs defective hamster cell line, v3- <dig>  which has reduced levels of nhej activity. we find that v3- <dig> cells are hypersensitive towards m-amsa . this result is in accordance with a recent publication by willmore and colleagues who found that a specific small-molecule inhibitor of dna-pkcs nu <dig> could potentate the sensitivity of human leukemic k <dig> cells towards various topoisomerase ii poisons  <cit> . our result is also in accordance with a recent report by adachi and colleagues showing that dna-pkcs knockout chicken dt <dig> cells are hypersensitive towards etoposide  <cit> . these result points towards an important role of dna-pkcs in determining the sensitivity of higher vertebrate cells towards topoisomerase ii poisons. different studies have demonstrated a more pronounced effect of inactivating ku as compared to dna-pkcs on cellular sensitivity towards topoisomerase ii poisons  <cit> . consequently, the importance of nhej in determining the sensitivity towards topoisomerase ii poisons in mammalian cells is likely to be underestimated from our v3- <dig> cell data. this notion is confirmed by early publications demonstrating that ku deficient hamster cells are highly sensitive towards m-amsa and etoposide  <cit> .

our finding that v3- <dig> cells are more sensitive towards icrf- <dig> than aa <dig> cells  is also in accordance with observations by adachi and colleagues who find that dna-pkcs deficient chicken dt <dig> cells are hypersensitive towards another bisdioxopiperazine analog, icrf- <dig>  these authors found the effect of inactivating dna-pkcs to be much more pronounced than seen in our present study. while the reason for this difference is not clear, it has to be mentioned that studies addressing the effect of dna-pkcs on the sensitivity towards topoisomerase ii targeting drugs and ionising radiation have produced varying results. thus, in a study by jin and colleagues, dna-pkcs defective murine cells were much less sensitive towards etoposide than ku <dig> and ku <dig> deficient cells  <cit> , while in a study by gao and colleagues the importance of dna-pkcs on the sensitivity towards ionising radiation was found to depend on cell type and/or cell cycle distribution  <cit> . such variation could well explain the different importance of dna-pkcs observed in our study and in the work by adachi and colleagues.

in order to study directly the effect of exposing mammalian cells to icrf- <dig> and m-amsa on the levels of hr, we employed a mammalian recombination assay previously described  <cit> . in this assay, m-amsa enhanced the level of recombination in spd <dig> cells to higher levels than icrf- <dig> at all cytotoxicity levels tested , demonstrating directly pronounced differences in the mechanism by which topoisomerase ii poisons and bisdioxopiperazines kill cells. this notion is further confirmed by our γh2ax induction experiments, where icrf- <dig> causes much lower levels of induction , demonstrating that icrf- <dig> induces less dna breaks in cells than m-amsa. our observation that icrf- <dig> induces both hr and γh2ax induction in mammalian cells, is in agreement with a recent paper demonstrating by the use of comet assay and pulsed field gel electroforesis that icrf- <dig> induces dna breaks in mammalian cells  <cit> . this result is also in agreement with our real-time pcr results where icrf- <dig> tended to induce the expression of established dna damage-inducible genes.

the finding that icrf- <dig> induces lower levels of hr than m-amsa in spd <dig> cells at equitoxic doses may be explained in at least two ways. bisdioxopiperazine-induced dna breaks could be more toxic to cells than breaks induced by topoisomerase ii poisons, or the dna breaks could be only partly responsible for killing the cells. three lines of evidence support the latter possibility.  functional atr, but not atm, is required for a cell cycle checkpoint arrest induced by icrf- <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that dna breaks are not involved in triggering the checkpoint signal.  exposure of mammalian cells to the topoisomerase ii poison etoposide induces degradation of the large subunit of rna polymerase ii indicative of dna breaks, while this is not the case for icrf- <dig>  <cit> .  our finding that cell survival in the presence of icrf- <dig> depends less on hr than cell survival in the presence of m-amsa suggests that icrf-187-induced dna breaks contribute less to overall cytotoxicity than m-amsa-induced dna breaks. if icrf-187-induced dna breaks were more toxic to cells than m-amsa-induced dna breaks, cell survival in the presence of icrf- <dig> would be expected to depend at least as much on hr as cell survival in the presence of m-amsa. this is not the case.

what mechanisms are then responsible for producing the dna breaks induced by bisdioxopiperazines in cells? in a recent work by oestergaard and colleagues).) <cit> , it is suggested that the toxic intermediate causing bisdioxopiperazine cytotoxicity is topoisomerase ii stably bound to two dna segments – a conformation they suggested would only be attainable if the dna strand passage reaction of topoisomerase ii is functioning. hr could then be required for the repair of dna breaks generated by the collision of dna tracking complexes with such four-way dna junctions / topoisomerase ii closed clamp complexes on dna. it has recently been demonstrated by the use of pulsed field gel electrophoresis, that inhibiting dna replication by aphidicolin does not reduce the level of dna breaks generated by exposure of mammalian cells to icrf <dig>  while the level of m-amsa-induced dna breaks was reduced by aphidicolin treatment  <cit> . this result suggests that collision of the dna replication complex with bisdioxopiperazine-induced topoisomerase ii closed clamp complex on dna is not involved in generating the dna breaks.

in a recent study by lundin and colleagues, it was demonstrated that inhibiting dna replication by exposing cells to hydroxyurea resulted in the generation of dna breaks  <cit> . furthermore, in this work as well as in a subsequent work  <cit> , hr was shown to be functionally involved in repairing such dna breaks. the first of these two studies used the same four hamster cell lines that are also used in our present study. remarkably, the relative sensitivity of these cell lines towards hydroxyurea exactly resembles their sensitivity towards icrf- <dig> seen in our present work. this may suggest that replication arrest is involved in generating dna breaks induced by bisdioxopiperazines in cells. here, replication forks stalled at the bisdioxopiperazine-induced closed clamp complexes could be the source of dna breaks in newly replicated dna  <cit> . this would also explain the lack of effect of aphidicolin on the level of icrf-193-induced dna breaks observed by hajji and colleagues  <cit> . if the dna breaks result from arrested replications forks, and not from the collision of the dna replication complex with the closed clamp complex on dna, no effect of aphidicolin would be expected. this mechanism would also explain why yeast cells arrested in intra-s phase are not protected from icrf- <dig> cytotoxicity  <cit> . we therefore suggest that this mechanism is responsible for generating dna breaks induced by bisdioxopiperazines in cells.

together our hr, γh2ax, and cytotoxicity data suggest that bisdioxopiperazines kill cells by a combination of dna break-related and dna break-unrelated mechanisms. this raises the question as to which mechanism is / are involved in mediating the dna break-unrelated part of bisdioxopiperazine cytotoxicity. exposure of mammalian cells to icrf- <dig> represses global transcription and mediates selective degradation of topoisomerase ii β via a transcription dependent mechanism  <cit> . inhibition of the rna polymerase ii – transcription complex by bisdioxopiperazine-induced topoisomerase ii complexes on dna could therefore be involved in mediating the dna break-unrelated component of bisdioxopiperazine cytotoxicity.

treatment of mammalian cells with high doses of icrf- <dig> for one hour is capable of antagonising dna breaks and the cytotoxicity of topoisomerase ii poisons  <cit> , and this antagonism can be extended to animal models, where icrf- <dig> can antagonise etoposide toxicity  <cit>  and bone marrow depression . how are bisdioxopiperazines capable of antagonising the effects of topoisomerase ii while at the same time producing dna breaks? two independent studies assessing the dose- and schedule-dependency of combinations of bisdioxopiperazines and topoisomerase ii poisons on cytotoxicity in mammalian cells may provide important clues. one study investigated the effect of combinations of icrf- <dig> and etoposide  <cit> . here, continuous administration of low doses of both drugs resulted in synergistic cell kill, while treatment with high concentrations of icrf- <dig> for one hour efficiently antagonised etoposide-mediated cytotoxicity. a similar effect of schedule and concentration on cytotoxicity has also been observed for combinations of icrf- <dig> and daunorubicin  <cit> , but here long time exposure of the cells to both drugs resulted in an additive effect on cell kill. we have previously shown that exposure of mammalian cells to high concentrations of icrf- <dig>  alone for  <dig> min is non-toxic, and that this treatment efficiently antagonises etoposide-induced dna breaks and cytotoxicity  <cit> . in these studies, exposure of cells to  <dig> μm icrf- <dig> was found to trap most cellular topoisomerase ii α and β as non-extractable complexes on dna. the inability of topoisomerase ii poisons to act on bisdioxopiperazine-stabilised closed clamp complexes on dna could therefore explain the antagonistic effect of high concentrations of bisdioxopiperazines generally observed in one-hour drug exposure experiments  <cit> . when a low concentration of bisdioxopiperazine is administered, it is most likely that only a small fraction of the topoisomerase ii molecules in the cell is trapped as closed clamp complexes on dna, leaving some or most topoisomerase ii molecules available for the action of topoisomerase ii poisons. therefore, after long-time exposure of cells to low concentrations of bisdioxopiperazine and a topoisomerase ii poison, covalent and non-covalent complexes of topoisomerase ii on dna could both contribute to cytotoxicity by generating dna breaks via different mechanisms, thus explaining the additive or synergistic effect on cell kill observed under these circumstances.

to summarise, our data are consistent with a model where bisdioxopiperazine-induced cytotoxicity results from a combination of dna break-related and -unrelated mechanisms, where the dna-break unrelated mechanism is clearly not mediated by the inhibition of catalytic topoisomerase ii activity in the cells.

CONCLUSIONS
since the discovery by andoh and colleagues in  <dig>  that the bisdioxopiperazines target eukaryotic topoisomerase ii  <cit> , their mode of cytotoxicity has been the cause of debate. while early publications tended to classify these compounds as "pure" catalytic inhibitors of topoisomerase ii, expected to kill cells by depriving them of essential topoisomerase ii catalytic activity, numerous recent reports present data that are not consistent with this view  <cit> . in the present report we have characterised bisdioxopiperazine  induced cytotoxicity in yeast and mammalian cells by using a combination of genetic and molecular approaches. our results are consistent with a model where bisdioxopiperazines cause cytotoxicity by stabilising a topoisomerase ii reaction intermediate / complex on dna inducing dna breaks in cells which are repaired by hr and nhej. we propose that cells exposed to bisdioxopiperazines die by a combination of dna break-related and-dna break-unrelated mechanisms. our study clearly establishes that bisdioxopiperazines do not kill cells solely by depriving them of topoisomerase ii catalytic activity.
