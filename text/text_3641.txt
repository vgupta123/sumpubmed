BACKGROUND
the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing hormone , discovered in  <dig>  is the key regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis  <cit>  and orchestrates the neuroendocrine, autonomic and behavioral responses to stress  <cit> . stress and disturbances in the crh system, i.e. hyperactivity and impaired negative feedback regulation of the hpa axis, are frequently accompanying psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety  <cit> . the crh system has been extensively studied applying genetically engineered gain-and loss-of-function mouse models underscoring its importance for the development of psychiatric disorders  <cit> .

the two crh receptors, crhr <dig> and crhr <dig>  are class b g protein-coupled seven transmembrane receptors that are capable of activating different g proteins and signaling cascades upon ligand-binding. the dominant crhr1-activated signaling pathway in endogenous and recombinant cell lines is the adenylyl cyclase-protein kinase a  pathway via gαs  <cit> . dependent on species, tissue and cell type, both receptors are known to activate gαq/phospholipase c -, akt/pi <dig> kinase-, nos/guanylyl cyclase-, caspase pro apoptotic-and nfkb or nurr1/nur <dig> transcription factor signaling pathways  <cit> . in att- <dig> cells, a mouse corticotrope pituitary tumor cell line expressing crhr <dig>  pka activation on the one hand triggers ca2+-dependent signaling via camkii, which increases nur <dig> and nurr <dig> transcription  <cit> . on the other hand, pka activates a mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathway including rap <dig>  b-raf, mek <dig> and extracellular signal-regulated kinase  1/ <dig> resulting in nur <dig> phosphorylation/transactivation and transcription of proopiomelanocortin . in specific brain areas such as the hippocampus crh activates erk1/ <dig> via crhr <dig>  whereas in hypothalamic nuclei and the central nucleus of the amygdala crh triggers other signaling pathways as no crh-dependent erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation was detected  <cit> . crhr <dig>  as key regulator of the neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to stress, has attracted major interest as a potential novel target for the therapeutic intervention in major depressive disorder  <cit> . however, crh/crhr1-dependent signal transduction mechanisms are only partially understood. therefore, a more precise understanding of the involved intracellular signaling mechanisms is a prerequisite towards the development of efficient and less pleiotropic crhr1-specific antagonists  <cit> .

the activation of specific signaling pathways will cause changes in gene expression signatures. changes at transcriptional level normally precede changes at protein level and provide an entry point to understand the underlying regulatory networks. expression profiling applying high-throughput microarray technology allows monitoring thousands of genes simultaneously and to characterize changes in gene expression patterns induced by a defined stimulus on a genome-wide scale. in order to dissect signaling mechanisms of the crhr <dig> in depth we used att- <dig> cells, which are a well established in vitro system to study crhr <dig> signaling  <cit> . to gain insight into the dynamics of crh-/crhr1-dependent signaling pathways we investigated the alterations in expression patterns after crh treatment at five different time points between  <dig> and  <dig> h on the max planck institute of psychiatry   <dig> k cdna microarray platform  <cit> .

for the analysis of expression profiling data a plethora of methods has been developed in order to rank genes by t-statistics  <cit> . applying these univariate feature selection methods the most significantly regulated genes can be determined, but variables  are always considered in isolation. our aim was to predict gene-gene interactions between candidate genes that are significantly regulated within the time course by sequentially using univariate as well as multivariate variable selection methods and afterwards graphical models. multivariate variable selection was considered of importance because variables  contribute only in combination with other variables to the discrimination of the input data rather than in isolation. for variable selection we used a maximum likelihood discriminant method , which is equivalent to linear discriminant analysis  combined with a genetic algorithm   <cit> . the method combines a small number of five variables  into subsets  mimicking biological crossover and mutation for computation of the discriminant function. due to computational limitations to determine all possible chromosomes out of the complete set of variables a stochastic search strategy for feature selection is necessary. ga procedures in combination with classification methods have been successfully used in the analysis of microarray data  <cit> . other optimization procedures implementing classification methods such as the greedy algorithm and simulated annealing were also investigated here and in the past  <cit> . to oppose mlhd embedded in ga to selection procedures which are in principle not affected by the dimensionally problem  also random forest was used. subsequently, graphical gaussian models  have been applied to a small subset of genes in order to derive genetic interactions  <cit> . the resulting putative gene-gene interactions from the graphical model were assigned to signaling pathways activated by crh/crhr <dig> via text mining methods.

RESULTS
identification of candidate genes
att- <dig> cells are a widely used and best studied in vitro model to investigate crhr1-dependent signal transduction. as pituitary-derived corticotrope cell line, att- <dig> cells express crhr <dig> but not crhr <dig>  <cit>  which permits specific analyses of crhr <dig> signaling. a plethora of molecules regulated downstream of crhr <dig> have been identified and studied in this cell line  <cit> , however, the complex system of crhr1-regulated signaling cascades is not fully understood. to further elucidate genes involved in crh-activated signaling pathways we treated the cells with  <dig> nm crh at five different time points . the dose of  <dig> nm crh was chosen as  <dig> nm crh evokes a response in att- <dig> cells but is still below the concentration of maximal stimulation observed in transactivation assays  <cit> . within the first  <dig> h crh is known to activate immediate early genes such as c-fos  <cit> . with the first two time points this immediate early effect of crh was investigated whereas at  <dig> and  <dig> h the late crh response was analysed. furthermore, we were interested in the long-term effects of  <dig> h of continuous crh treatment.

the gene expression data obtained by microarray analysis of crh-treated vs untreated att- <dig> cells at different time points have been deposited in ncbi's gene expression omnibus   <cit>  and are accessible by the geo series accession numbers gse <dig> and gpl <dig> 

candidate genes were selected following  data normalization and preprocessing,  a preselection process and  supervised variable selection . by statistical tests it has been verified that prerequisites for the two-way anova like normal distributed expression ratios and equal variances across samples are fulfilled. furthermore, a balanced design was chosen in the present microarray study meaning equal group size of six technical replicates for each time point. as the technical replicates were performed on six different arrays, the data sets are independent.

normalization and dye-swap correction
ma-plots of the spot signals from  <dig> pins  before and after the normalization procedure are shown in additional file  <dig> . the normalization procedure was successful as the loess fit curves in the ma-plots of the transformed array data  show nearly horizontal lines meaning that most of the genes do not show much change in their intensity ratios as expected  <cit> . after normalization, signals of  <dig> spots measured at each time point were tested applying a linear model to exclude genes showing significant dye-dependent effects in their expression profile over time. a microarray design based on fixed effects parameters which was applied here was originally described by kerr and churchill  <cit> . according to this fixed effects model differential expression values of  <dig> genes  with a significant interaction of the factors time and dye-swap were excluded from the dataset.

preselection 2-way anova
it is important to further restrict microarray data before multivariate analysis since most of the genes do not show dynamic differential expression over time following crh stimulation and thus do not contribute to the discrimination between classes. by applying a two-way linear model without interaction of the factors time and dye-swap, genes were preselected for supervised clustering and variable selection with ga/mlhd. because one of the main assumptions of the anova is equal variances across groups we applied levene's test for homogeneity of variance. for the predominant part of the gene expression ratios it has been verified by levene's test that there is no shift in variation resulting in  <dig> of  <dig> tests with p <  <dig> % and a maximum fdr of  <dig> %. by the two-way anova utilized in the preselection process,  <dig> genes  were identified as significantly regulated over time. this reduction of the feature space was proposed by many authors  <cit>  to improve the predictive power of the classifier. in principle, due to the small number of genes in a subset  considered as training data for classification, a reduction of the initial data set is not necessary. however, stochastic searches such as genetic algorithms are able to detect only a small part of the total solution space. to reduce the solution space and to generate more stable results, we used the preselected set of  <dig> genes as input for the galgo program. before, shapiro-wilk's tests  were performed to demonstrate that the expression ratios were log2-normally distributed for the preselected genes as well as for the genes used as input for the anova. considering the corresponding preselected gene expression ratios  <dig> of  <dig> tests showed p <  <dig> % with a maximum fdr of 10% while regarding the whole data set used in the two-way anova for feature preselection  <dig> of  <dig> tests resulted in p <  <dig> % and a maximum fdr of  <dig> %.

ga/mlhd
the general application of the maximum likelihood  classifier implemented in a genetic algorithm to microarray datasets was demonstrated by trevino and ooi  <cit> . in addition it was shown that for a chromosome size of five variables as used in the present study the classification error resulting from mlhd is similar compared to other classifiers   of  <cit> ).

additional file  <dig> shows the complete list of  <dig> transcripts derived from four independent galgo analyses based on the preselected genes including all genes occurring at least once within the top  <dig> ranks. the frequency rank of each gene was determined by counting the chromosomes with the respective gene reaching a classification accuracy of 100% . in total, there are  <dig> genes that occur in all four runs among the topmost  <dig> ranked genes. excluding those genes that were not fully annotated, a total of  <dig> genes remained in four runs among the topmost ranked genes. one exception is the addition of hmgcs <dig> because it was detected twice  in at least three galgo analysis results. hence,  <dig> unique candidate genes, which contributed strongly to the discrimination between groups  were selected for further validation by qrt-pcr.

with multivariate selection procedures variables  are tested in combination to identify interactions between them. detailed inspection of the chromosomes  revealed that often combinations of candidate genes with complete discrimination occurred in the galgo analysis results . therefore, the selected genes are expected to be highly correlated with each other in terms of gene interaction networks. the dependency of top ranked ga  selected feature components with each other  was also investigated by metabolic profiling studies with help of mass spectrometry  <cit> . the authors conclude that preliminary hypothesis can be generated based on ga selected features  however it is also important to consider more complete knowledge of biological pathways from e.g. public databases or text mining tools.

reliability of candidate genes
feature selection is critical when lda is applied to microarray datasets where the number of genes  is distinctly larger than the number of samples  because overfitting can easily occur. to solve this problem we investigated several optimization algorithms for feature selection based on mlhd or lda considering subsets of variables in which the number of genes is smaller than the sample size . the minimum sample size suggested is five observations per independent variable . each chromosome of the ga/mlhd and sann/lda approach has a 6: <dig> ratio of observations to predictor variables, which meets the 5: <dig> ratio recommended. furthermore, generalization curves based on the preselected expression ratios showed that a chromosome size of five is far away from a situation of overfitting because for a number of variables greater than  <dig> the test error  increases while the training error  do not change much .

we also took random forest classification into account, which is suited for datasets where the number of variables is larger than the number of samples .

greedy/lda
we performed the greedy feature selection and applied lda to the selected gene expression ratios. each leave-one-out training set consisted of  <dig> to  <dig> genes and was achieved by repeating the f-test as long as the difference between two statistical models was significantly low. the loocv classification error was 23%, which is in the same range as shown by wang et al.  <cit>  using greedy-lda selection methods. a ranked list was generated based on the frequency of each gene in the training sets of the samples. the selected genes were compared to the extracted features from the ga/mlhd procedure, and an overlap of 59%  was determined . in case of the  <dig> candidates  <dig> genes of the greedy feature selection procedure coincide and in case of the top  <dig> validated candidates  <dig> genes overlapped, only acsl <dig> is missing. in summary, both feature selection methods resulted in a clear overlap of the selected genes. the advantage of a greedy algorithm is the requirement of much less computational resources and that it is faster to execute. on the other hand, the greedy algorithm does not reach always a global optimal solution  <cit> . to address this limitation we tested also simulated annealing, another optimization search algorithm, for the validation of the ga/mlhd results.

2) pex <dig> missing

3) acsl <dig> missing

sann/lda
in contrast to a greedy algorithm which often leads to a local optimum, simulated annealing  derived from statistical mechanics converges to global optimum solution. in this sa approach a fitness function  was applied evaluating the classification error by using loocv and lda instead of the physical energy. sa operates as a probabilistic hill-climbing procedure searching for the global optimum of the fitness  function. simulated annealing has previously been demonstrated to be suitable for classification of gene expression data from microarrays by training of an artificial neural network  <cit> . to select gene expression ratios for the calculation of fitness values in the optimization process and to constrain the search space we developed an algorithm for input selection of subsets of variables . a similar approach with the purpose of aggregating an ideally minimal subset of inputs with strong discriminative capability was described by filippone et al.  <cit> . details about our r-code for input selection can be found in the additional file  <dig>  altogether  <dig> transcripts resulted from four separate sann/lda analyses including all genes occurring at least once within the top  <dig> genes ranked by their frequency in chromosomes, which reached a classification accuracy of 100%.  <dig> out of these  <dig> transcripts were in accordance with the  <dig> transcripts from four galgo runs representing an overlap of 80%. further comparison of the results of both feature selection methods sann/lda and ga/mlhd revealed identical selected genes  including all candidates  as well as the validated candidate genes  . with sann/lda we reached a better overlap than in case of greedy/lda and ga/mlhd. we ascribe this higher accordance of selected features by sann/lda and ga/mlhd to a more extensive variable combination caused by a similar evolutionary algorithm of both methods compared to greedy/lda. for sann/lda we chose the same input parameters i.e. chromosome size, amount of solution chromosomes and fitness score just as for ga/mlhd. one of the main differences of simulated annealing compared to genetic algorithm is the use of only mutations in chromosomes whereas the genetic algorithm in addition takes the combination of two parent chromosomes  into account. in summary, despite of the more sophisticated search procedure in the genetic algorithm we obtained a high overlap between the respective top  <dig> selected genes of sann/lda as well as ga/mlhd and therefore validated the galgo results. a further sann/lda analysis using a chromosome size of three instead of five revealed also a high agreement of selected genes  with ga/mlhd confirming the stability of the results .

similar to the discriminant vector in classical lda a supported vector machine -based approach performs gene selection using a weight vector. one approach for gene selection using svm is the recursive feature elimination  introduced by guyon et al.  <cit> . filippone et al. implemented the classification method svm in their input selection algorithm  <cit> . we also tested svm in our feature selection algorithm but the sann/svm method showed distinctly more chromosomes used for classification with a higher loocv error rate than sann/lda . another advantage of lda compared to svm implemented in the sa based gene selection method  is that it requires much less computational resources and it is faster.

random forest
to contrast the outcome of the ga/mlhd feature selection procedure with classification methods proposed to be not affected by the dimensional problem , which is the case for microarray data analysis we applied also tree classifiers. random forest  represents an algorithm for classification which uses an ensemble of classification trees  <cit> . each classification tree is generated by selecting a bootstrap sample of the data, and at each split predictor variables are randomly selected. therefore, random forest includes bagging  <cit> , i.e. bootstrap aggregating, as well as random variable selection for tree building. gene selection and classification of microarray data via rf has been successfully applied by díaz-uriarte and alvarez de andrés  <cit> . in rf feature selection procedures both the permutation and the gini importance can be used to determine the relevance of each variable  <cit> . the mean decrease in gini criterion was computed for each variable  obtained by rf analysis using the  <dig> expression ratios of the preselected genes. the resulting list was sorted according to the gini index in descending order and the top most  <dig> genes were compared to the selected genes by ga/mlhd. a considerable overlap of the top ranked genes of the rf analysis with the selected genes by galgo of up to 71%  was determined  and a similar overlap of up to 65%  by utilization of the permutation importance . furthermore, we found  <dig> of the  <dig> candidate and  <dig> of the  <dig> validated candidate genes  by the gini importance ranked lists with an out of bag  classification error of  <dig> %. we conclude from the good agreement of the selected genes in both feature selection methods that classical lda or mlhd in combination with genetic search algorithms delivers comparable results with algorithms using tree classifiers like rf. in this context, it is important to mention that the training data sets used for the evaluation of the linear discriminant coefficients were always based on small subsets of gene expression ratios . in other words, the number of genes considered for lda or mlhd classification  was set to be smaller than the smallest group size  technical replicates per time point)  <cit>  which is a strong criterion to reduce overfitting  <cit> .

the candidate genes identified with ga/mlhd are reliable because we were able to confirm the resulting list of the most discriminative features by two other optimization algorithms greedy as well as sa and by the tree classifier method random forest. we performed data preprocessing  which is important for further analysis and took care of parameter optimization which is essential to avoid the tendency of overfitting in a multivariate approach.

prediction of gene-gene interactions
pca
in order to test whether a separation of the expression profiles of the candidate genes into time points  can be achieved using unsupervised clustering methods, a principal component analysis  was performed. the underlying data matrix consisted of  <dig> rows for the genes and  <dig> columns for  <dig> time points including  <dig> technical replicates. the resulting scores and loadings from pca for the objects  and variables , respectively, were visualized by a biplot  allowing for interpretation of relationships between them. similar negative gene scores on the x-axis  of pex <dig>  cd3e and nf <dig>  which are in the same region as the  <dig> h time point vectors, are well correlated with each other. fosl <dig> and crem, which show positive scores on pc <dig> and are located in the vicinity of the  <dig> h vectors, are also correlated. if the vectors point at the same region as the data points of the objects the gene expression is increased, otherwise it is decreased. time points close to each other in figure 2a have similar gene expression patterns. this is supported by the heatmap in figure 2b, showing e.g. fosl <dig> and crem  upregulated after  <dig> h and downregulated after  <dig> h of crh treatment, whereas pex <dig>  cd3e and nf <dig> were downregulated after  <dig> h and upregulated after  <dig> h. examples for poor correlation in their differential expression according to figure 2a are pex <dig> and fosl <dig> as well as nf <dig> and acsl <dig> which have negative and positive scores on pc <dig>  respectively. furthermore, figure 2a and 2b show that the expression patterns of the  <dig> candidate genes are able to clearly discriminate the time point groups  <dig> and  <dig> h,  <dig> and  <dig> h as well as the time point  <dig> h. within the first  <dig> h crh is known to regulate immediate early genes such as c-fos  <cit> . therefore, the pca analysis reflects common transcriptional changes within the first  <dig> h of treatment including signaling molecules. moreover, the correlation of the time points  <dig> and  <dig> h mirror similar processes on transcriptional level regulated by a late crh response represented by genes involved in metabolic processes. long-term effects of crh were clearly discriminated at  <dig> h where the regulation of primary signaling molecules is no longer needed but specific downstream cellular processes are activated.

genenet
the subset of  <dig> candidate genes with high frequency ranks derived from the supervised variable selection procedure and investigated by pca was further analyzed by constructing a gene association network with help of the r package genenet  <cit> , another unsupervised correlation method. primarily, genenet was developed for analyzing gene expression  data with focus on the interference of gene networks  <cit> . the resulting undirected graph from the genenet program is shown in figure  <dig>  we considered gene pairs with |pcor| >  <dig>  and corresponding p-values <  <dig>  at their edges and additionally unconnected nodes. the association network of putatively co-regulated genes consists of four main subnetworks with the gene clusters fosl2-crem, cd3e-pex13-nf <dig>  acsl4-hmgcs <dig> and loxl3-malat <dig> . these findings are in agreement with the above mentioned results of the pca-an independent unsupervised clustering method-where most of the gene clusters were found to be correlated, in particular fosl2-crem, pex13-cd3e-nf <dig> and acsl4-hmgcs <dig> .

a complete discrimination  into time points was achieved with sets of five genes  in the case of pebp <dig>  mat2a, crem, hmgcs <dig> and malat <dig> as well as in case of mat2a, crem, cd3e, fols <dig> and malat <dig>  the concordance of genes from these two chromosomes with genes in every subnetwork derived from genenet indicates that all four clusters including the two unconnected nodes  play an important role for the description of the overall time response.

reconstruction of crh signaling pathways by text mining
to validate candidate interactions revealed in pca and genenet analyses the literature mining software pathway studio was used. direct and indirect protein-protein interactions, expression and promoter binding as well as regulation such as common regulators or targets were taken into account. every connection found by pathway studio was confirmed manually and incorrectly associated interactions were excluded. no literature-based interaction was found for the genenet-built connection of malat <dig> and loxl <dig> , which is consistent with the weak correlation in the pca results. in addition, for the negative partial correlation between hmgcs <dig> and loxl <dig> no relation was found using the pathway studio software, as was confirmed by pca . nf <dig>  pex <dig> and cd3e clustered together in the genenet algorithm because of their regulation  <dig> hours following crh stimulation. therefore, these molecules should not be involved in acute signal transduction but in the modulation of crh-dependent cellular processes such as proliferation or immune response  <cit> . along these lines, all three genes have divergent functions. nf <dig>  a tumor suppressor, plays a critical role in cell proliferation by blocking growth factor receptor-dependent pathways  <cit> . interestingly, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the cd3e genes is associated with antidepressant treatment response  <cit> . the peroxisomal biogenesis factor pex <dig> functions as protein transporter in peroxisomes and is related to fatty acid oxidation. the verification of the interactions predicted by genenet with the pathway studio software resulted in an indirect protein-protein interaction via sh <dig> domains. pex <dig> contains an sh <dig> domain itself, whereas nf <dig> and cd3e can bind proteins, which in turn are capable of binding sh <dig> domains  <cit> . moreover, a putative linkage of these three candidate genes to crhr1-camp-mediated signal transduction was found for nf <dig> . pka phosphorylates nf <dig>  which triggers the dimerization with ezrin and causes cell growth  <cit> . as crh is known to regulate cell proliferation nf <dig> could be one of the responsible molecules mediating the crh effect on cell growth  <cit> . additionally, nf <dig> is able to block map kinase signaling pathways  <cit>  and thereby possibly affects crhr1-regulated transcription.

the next group of interacting candidate genes containing hmgcs <dig> and acsl <dig>  is involved in lipid metabolism. both genes were found to be connected via the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor α  which maintains fatty acid homeostasis by induction of fatty acid oxidation and plays a role in controlling peroxisomal proliferation. hmgcs <dig> was also found to be regulated on protein level after  <dig> nm crh treatment of att- <dig> cells  <cit> . the hmgcs <dig> gene contains a peroxisome proliferator response element  in its promoter that binds ppara/rxr heterodimers  <cit>  and long-chain acyl-coa synthetases , like acsl <dig>  inhibit ppara-mediated transcription  <cit> . acsl <dig> transcription is activated by camp  <cit>  and ppara is phosphorylated by this second messenger  <cit>  linking these genes with gαs protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways.

the crh/crhr1-dependent regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism strengthens a potential role of crh as a modulator of metabolic function. many psychiatric and neurological disorders share changes in metabolism  <cit> . hmgcs <dig>  e.g., together with other genes linked to fatty acid metabolism is upregulated by antipsychotics in human glioma cells  <cit> .

the putatively connected candidate genes crem and fosl <dig> are both transcription factors. crem is a modulator of camp responsive element -dependent transcription  <cit>  and is known to be regulated by crh  <cit> . the expression of numerous genes such as crh or tyrosine hydroxylase involved in psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, respectively, is regulated by crem  <cit> . fosl <dig> is a transcription factor of the fos family, of which the immediate-early gene c-fos is the most prominent member. becquet and colleagues  showed that upon crh treatment transcription factors of the fos-and jun-family bind to the pomc promoter and regulate its transcription  <cit> . literature mining revealed camp as the connecting molecule for both transcription factors . camp-mediated induction of crem leads to transcription of its inducible form icer which is driven by an alternative intronic promoter  <cit> . in the case of fosl <dig>  camp leads to fosl2-dependent transcriptional regulation of genes containing an ap1-binding site in their promoter  <cit> . as it is well known that crh induces camp, and its downstream signaling cascades via a gαs protein the genenet algorithm not only elucidated an interaction between crem and fosl <dig>  but the result can be linked to crhr1-dependent signaling pathways, especially since the pomc promoter contains a camp-responsive element as well as an ap- <dig> binding site  <cit> . crem and fosl <dig> both showed an up-regulation within the first hour of crh stimulation. early regulated transcription factors crem and fosl <dig> may play an important role in the regulation of crhr1-dependent signal transduction, probably by triggering or coordinating the transcription of secondary regulated genes.

nf <dig>  acsl <dig>  crem and fosl <dig> are known to be regulated by camp and thus targets of gαs-protein-dependent signaling mechanisms. as crh/crhr <dig> promotes the synthesis of the second messenger camp the regulation of these four candidate genes by camp is likely to depend on direct crh stimulation. as camp activates different signaling cascades via pka such as creb, l-type ca2+channels and map kinase pathways, the distinct time-dependent differential regulation of candidate genes is likely to be stimulated by those different downstream pathways. additionally, secondary effects of crh-activated signaling such as expression and transactivation of transcription factors, e.g. of the ap <dig> family, lead to time-delayed changes in gene expression.

in summary, according to present knowledge, the inter-gene connections identified by the genenet algorithm were validated and additionally integrated into known crhr <dig> signaling pathways.

validation of crh-regulated genes over time via qrt-pcr
to strengthen the biological relevance of the theoretical findings based on multivariate galgo and unsupervised genenet algorithms the microarray data were partly confirmed by quantitative real-time pcr on all candidate genes that were analyzed by pca and genenet, respectively, and subsequently verified by applying the pathway studio software. total rna isolated from two independent biological replicates at different time points was reverse transcribed and cdna was analyzed in technical duplicates by qrt-pcr. as an internal standard the housekeeping genes hprt and gapdh were used. both genes were not differentially regulated in att- <dig> cells by crh stimulation.

we confirmed that after crh stimulation the transcription of crem was increased in the first  <dig> hours. the differential expression of fosl <dig> was increased at the time points  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h in the microarray as well as in the qrt-pcr. acsl <dig> and hmgcs <dig> showed increased mrna levels in both analysis at  <dig> and  <dig> hours whereas nf <dig> and pex <dig> were upregulated by crh after  <dig> and  <dig> hours . the expression level of cd3e was out of the linear detection range of the lightcycler instrument and thus not validated. with both internal references, hprt and gapdh, similar results were obtained. the microarray and qrt-pcr regulation values correlated well confirming the validity of the expression kinetics. genes were defined as validated when the direction of regulation as determined by qrt-pcr was at least at one time point in agreement with the microarray result. to reveal the significance of the qrt-pcr in comparison to the microarray results anova was performed. for crem, fosl <dig> and nf <dig> the crh-and time-dependent changes in expression are significant in microarray and qrt-pcr data and for acsl <dig> the p-value shows a trend showing the reproducibility of the microarray results in independent material . for hmgcs <dig> and pex <dig> no significance in the anova was obtained although the expression changes over time are similar in the qrt-pcr and in the microarray data. in the case of hmgcs <dig> the variance between the samples is high, thus the analysis of more samples would help to get the results statistically significant. in the case of pex <dig> the differential expression in the microarray analysis is very low and therefore difficult to validate with qrt-pcr although the regulation at  <dig> h was measured in both experiments.

the validation of the expression dynamics supported the clustering results of the genenet algorithm. genes similarly regulated over time were considered as putative interaction partners. as the validated six candidate genes showed differential expression over time in an independent experiment, the co-regulated genes crem and fosl <dig>  acsl <dig> and hmgcs <dig>  nf <dig> and pex <dig> can be regarded as important mediators of crh/crhr1-dependent signaling pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
to dissect crhr1-dependent signaling pathways in detail, genome-wide expression profiling of crh-stimulated att- <dig> cells was performed at five different time points. a combination of univariate preselection, multivariate discriminant analyses followed by unsupervised graphical models was employed to find genes significantly regulated by crh/crhr1-dependent mechanisms. starting with more than  <dig> expressed genes, we isolated a small subset of genes connected to crhr <dig> signaling mechanisms. we focused on genes that occurred multiple times in galgo analyses and contributed significantly to the discrimination of different time points following crh treatment. additional analyses using the state-of-the-art algorithm random forest as well as further optimization methods such as sann and greedy, revealed similar results which strengthened the reliability of the galgo results. consequently, possible correlations between these genes were determined by pca and genenet. moreover, the differential expression of a subset of candidates was validated independently and determined interactions were confirmed via pathway studio software. this approach was able to condense the enormous dataset to a manageable subset of discriminative genes, which can now be subjected to detailed functional studies.
