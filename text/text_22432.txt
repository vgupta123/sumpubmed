BACKGROUND
cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases, which catalyze substrate-, regio- and stereo-specific oxygenation steps in plant metabolism, have evolved to a huge superfamily of enzymes. plant genome sequencing initiatives recently revealed  <dig> full-length p <dig> genes in chlamydomonas reinhartii,  <dig> in the moss physcomitrella patens,  <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana,  <dig> in rice and  <dig> in populus trichocarpa  <cit> . however, according to the most recent survey  <cit> , only  <dig> of the  <dig> coding sequences in the a. thaliana genome have been associated with a specific biochemical function. the high complexity of the p <dig> superfamily as opposed to the relatively scarce information available on the functions of individual p <dig> enzymes was one of the surprises of the first sequenced plant genomes  <cit> . assuming that p <dig> number and diversification in plants mirrors the evolution of chemical-, ecological- and bio-diversity, it points to an unexpectedly poor understanding of secondary metabolism, even in model plants. this led us to assume that an extensive analysis of p <dig> gene expression might actually be used to identify the metabolic networks, to highlight overlooked aspects of plant metabolism, and to reveal functions of "orphan" p <dig> enzymes.

an extensive and sustained annotation of the p <dig> genes in sequenced organisms, including plants, is being carried out and has been made publicly available on a university of tennesse website maintained by david nelson . annotation of a. thaliana p <dig> genes has also been curated and collated in other databases by different organizations . they include comments on genomic, cdna and protein sequences, genetic maps, phylogeny, function, available mutants and tissue-specific gene expression based on a boutique p <dig> gene microarray. on the other hand, information on the expression of individual p <dig> genes can be obtained from large scale digital gene expression databases. also several large scale co-expression tools are available to compare the expression profile of a gene of interest with individual genes, or all genes available on the microarray  <cit>  .

such resources have been used as a starting point to create the comprehensive database, 'cypedia' , which combines large scale p <dig> expression data with functional annotation. in a first step, affymetrix ath <dig> microarray data were extracted from publicly available experiments to generate comprehensive gene expression matrices for all p450s. in a second step, correlation of the expression of each p <dig> gene with the expression of  <dig>  selected and carefully re-annotated genes representative of plant metabolism was examined. such a comparative analysis reveals highly complex and divergent expression patterns for the majority of p450s, and provides novel clues on p <dig> functions, related pathways, and corresponding regulatory networks. this paper describes the construction of the database, its content, and provides some examples of general and more specific information, which can be extracted from it.

RESULTS
p <dig> gene family information and expression data
a total of  <dig> p450s from a. thaliana are listed in the place arabidopsis p <dig> database  <cit> . using the corresponding locus identifiers   <dig> genes were found to be represented on the affymetrix ath <dig> microarray represented by  <dig> probe sets . a list of all p <dig> genes, the associated agi loci, and the probe sets used can be found in additional file  <dig> and at the 'cypedia' homepage. a description of their biochemical function is also given  and links to relevant publications as well as to information in external databases, such as 'matdb, 'tair', or 'signal' . we retrieved normalized gene expression data for the selected probe sets from the 'genevestigator digital northern' tool  <cit>  covering more than  <dig>  microarrays. upon background correction, the mean intensity ratios of replicates from each experiment was placed in one of the following four categories: i) organ and tissue samples from wild type plants , ii) stress treatment of wild type plants , iii) hormone, nutrient , and other treatments , and iv) mutant plants .

organ and tissue-specific expression
across the organ and tissue data set, only seven p <dig> genes  are not expressed more than twofold above background in any sample. an additional  <dig> genes  are expressed in only one sample, and two genes in only two samples . these may thus be considered as not detectably expressed in the organ sample set. this group includes all putative pseudogenes represented on the affymetrix array. conversely,  <dig> probe sets do show expression in more than two experiments, but in less than 20% of the  <dig> organ and tissue samples , indicating highly specialized expression for 43% of the p <dig> genes represented on the array. groups of flower, root, or leaf specific p450s are apparent. for example,  <dig> probe sets exhibit expression  in more than 80% of all root samples ; of these, nine are expressed in less than 20% of other samples . using the same definition, we also identified five flower specific and four leaf specific p450s. these represent the most specifically expressed genes . on the other hand, only  <dig> probe sets indicate expression in more than 80% of the tissue and organ samples covered , and the corresponding  <dig> p <dig> genes may thus be considered constitutively expressed or house-keeping genes . the complete p <dig> organ and tissue expression matrix can be found at the 'cypedia' web page following the link 'view matrices'.

stress response
a large group of p450s is responsive to one or several stresses across the  <dig> stress treatment experiments. more genes are up-regulated than down-regulated. while  <dig> probe sets show induction in more than  <dig> experiments, only two genes are repressed in more than  <dig> treatments. the complete stress response matrix of all p450s can be found at the 'cypedia' web page following the link 'view matrices'. to highlight stress induction of p450s, we selected  <dig> probe sets representing  <dig> p450s showing more than twofold up-regulation in at least 30% of the experiments, within at least one of the treatment groups . a group of nine probe sets representing eleven p450s stands out as being strongly induced by bacterial and fungal pathogens . these genes are induced rapidly in incompatible interactions between a. thaliana and pseudomonas syringae, while induction in compatible interactions is comparatively slower as it has been observed for many defense related genes  <cit> . they are also induced by elicitors and by some abiotic stresses including oxidative, osmotic, and uv stress . among these genes, cyp71b <dig> has been well characterized as being pathogen-responsive and has been shown to encode an enzyme involved in the last step of camalexin biosynthesis, the major a. thaliana phytoalexin  <cit> . more recently, cyp71a <dig>  was shown to catalyze an earlier step in camalexin formation  <cit> . also previously characterized as differentially regulated in compatible and incompatible interactions and senescence is cyp76c <dig>  <cit> , although in this case the protein function was not elucidated. conversely, cyp710a <dig> had not been implicated in defense response, but was shown to be involved in stigmasterol biosynthesis  <cit> . so far, no function or involvement in defense has been described for the remaining genes in this group.

another distinct cluster is defined by a group of  <dig> p450s . these genes are not  responsive to pathogens, but are induced by several abiotic stresses, in particular by wounding, oxidative stresses , genotoxic stress , and by osmotic and salt stress . within this group are the well characterized allene oxide synthase  and the hydroperoxyde lyase   <cit> . both enzymes are involved in the oxylipin pathway leading to the biosynthesis of jasmonate and other oxygenated lipid derivatives involved in stress signaling. also in this group is cyp86a <dig>  which encodes an enzyme that Ï‰-hydroxylates fatty acids and is involved in cuticle oxylipin metabolism  <cit> .

hormone response
many p450s appear induced by treatment with methyl jasmonate  . while  <dig> p450s are induced in more than 30% of all mej treatment experiments, only three are repressed . among the former are again cyp74a and cyp74b <dig>  involved in the metabolism of fatty acid hydroperoxides  <cit> , which are well known to be induced by jasmonate, but also a large number of additional p450s . not all these are expected to be involved in oxylipin metabolism, but the group may include genes involved in other pathways regulated by jasmonate. this holds true for cyp79b <dig>  which converts tryptophan to the corresponding oxime, thus leading to the biosynthesis of indole glucosinolates, to camalexin, and to auxin  <cit> . it is interesting to note that cyp79b <dig> is repressed upon indole acetic acid  treatments. other obvious groups comprise p450s that are strongly induced by iaa treatment , or repressed by gibberellic acid  in seeds . in general, an extensive crosstalk between different hormone responses is apparent: eleven p450s are responsive to more than one hormone  in at least three treatment experiments per hormone group. antagonistic transcriptional responses of individual p450s are apparent between iaa and ga, mej and iaa, and cytokinin and iaa . strikingly, most of the hormone responsive p450s, when their functions are characterized, are themselves involved in hormone biosynthesis or catabolism: e.g. cyp734a <dig>  and cyp72c <dig>  are both involved in brassinosteroids catabolism  <cit> , cyp735a <dig> is catalyzing trans-zeatin formation  <cit> , and cyp79b <dig> is involved in iaa biosynthesis  <cit> . other hormone-responsive p450s with so far uncharacterized functions may thus also participate in hormone metabolic networks.

mutant wild type comparisons
the mapping of p <dig> expression in mutants most often highlights very specific responses in isolated mutants or mutant groups. in a few cases only, subsets of ten or more genes are co-regulated in response to one or several mutations. such coordinate responses provide leads to metabolic pathways as shown below. the most striking feature revealed by this data set is a very strong positive correlation of the activation of the set of p <dig> genes involved in stress response with the activation of the leafy gene  <cit> . the complete p <dig> mutant response matrix can be found at the 'cypedia' web page following the link 'view matrices'.

in summary, expression matrices identify groups of genes with specific functions during plant development or roles in plant defense, and signaling networks. these may guide further investigation into the function of individual members of this large gene family, including fine expression analyses, description of mutant phenotypes and tissue-targeted metabolic profiling. obvious hormonal networking and cross-talk may help to identify other enzymes involved in hormonal homeostasis and to highlight new and so far overlooked signaling pathways.

co-expression analysis
p450s catalyze slow and irreversible steps in all branches of the plant secondary metabolism. the underlying hypothesis of the cypedia approach assumes that genes acting in the same biochemical pathway are co-expressed. when their function is known, p450s are usually co-regulated with other enzymes in the same branch-pathway  <cit> . assuming that this may hold true also for yet uncharacterized p450s, we performed a comprehensive co-expression analysis comparing the expression of each p <dig> with that of  <dig>  selected genes involved in a. thaliana metabolism. these were retrieved from diverse databases including 'kegg', 'aracyc, 'acyllipid', biopathat', and selected publications devoted to the annotation of secondary metabolic pathways   <cit> . a list of all pathways and the associated genes can be found from the 'cypedia' page following the link 'browse pathways'. for these genes, we then added annotations derived from the 'functional catalogue' at 'matdb'  <cit>  and manually curated 'geneontology' terms from 'tair'  <cit> , as well as gene descriptions from 'tair' . based on a manual assessment of the combined annotations and literature reviews, each gene was given an annotation score reflecting the accuracy of the annotation .

the annotation information of each gene was combined with expression data as described above for the p <dig> genes. using the four expression vectors for each p <dig> as bait we calculated pearson correlation coefficients  with each of the  <dig>  selected genes for a total of  <dig>  Ã—  <dig> calculations on a beowulf computer cluster. for each p <dig>  similarly expressed genes  were kept. based on the number and annotation score of co-expressed genes, co-expressed pathways were identified for each p <dig> and expression dataset. the lists of co-expressed pathways can be found from the 'cypedia' home page following the 'pathway maps' link for each p <dig>  from there, links can be found to the individual heatmaps depicting the expression profile and detailed information of all co-expressed genes in each of the four data sets.

validation of pathway prediction: the phenylpropanoid metabolism as an example
in most cases, predicted functions based on top scoring co-expressed pathways agree well with the actual function of characterized p450s . for  <dig> out of  <dig> p450s with known functions the correct pathway was predicted using this approach . for an additional four p450s, no co-expressed pathways were identified. this was in most cases because the gene was not expressed to detectable levels in any experiment. of the eleven p450s for which a wrong pathway was predicted based on co-expression analysis, three had the correct pathway present within the ten highest scoring pathways. this leaves eight genes for which no correct pathway was identified . most of those are involved in hormone metabolism.

among the correctly predicted p450s are all three hydroxylases involved in lignin part of the phenylpropanoid pathway  <cit> . for example, when using cyp73a <dig> encoding cinnamate 4-hydroxylase  as bait, both in the organ and stress data sets all other genes characterized to act in the general phenylpropanoid pathway were retrieved with r-values higher than  <dig>  . correlations were less pronounced in the remaining two datasets, but the annotated pathways 'phenylpropanoid metabolism'  and 'lignin biosynthesis'  were the top scoring pathways found in all four data sets in accordance with the actual biochemical function of cyp73a <dig>  <cit> . not only genes of different branches of the downstream phenylpropanoid pathways, but also isoforms for all upstream steps in the shikimate pathway  <cit>  leading to phenylalanine biosynthesis are co-expressed, thus reconstituting the full pathway .

it is important to note that a significant proportion of p450s might act in biochemical pathways not yet elucidated and may produce natural compounds which were never described. obviously, genes in such unknown pathways have not been annotated, and it is therefore impossible to predict these pathways using the co-expression approach. however, even in such cases valuable information can be obtained by careful inspection of co-expressed genes. this may be exemplified using the cyp <dig> family. cyp98a <dig> encodes p-coumaroyl shikimate/quinate 3'-hydroxylase  and is involved in the biosynthesis of monolignols  <cit> . this gene is tightly co-expressed with c4h and most other characterized genes involved in the general phenylpropanoid pathway . two other genes of the same family  share extensive sequence similarity with cyp98a <dig>  but were shown not to encode c3'h  <cit> . both cyp98a <dig> and cyp98a <dig> share an overlapping expression pattern that is very distinct from c3'h, with expression predominantly in floral tissues . in the organ data set, the top scoring co-expressed pathway for both genes appears as 'miscellaneous acyl lipid metabolism'  due to a large number of putative and known genes related to fatty acid metabolism, which are likely involved in pollen coat/wall development. however, several genes related to the phenylpropanoid pathway are also co-expressed with cyp98a <dig> and cyp98a <dig> . altogether, they encode 'phenylpropanoid-like' enzymes with unknown functions sharing sequence similarities with characterized phenylpropanoid enzymes  <cit> . this co-expression group thus appears to result from the duplication of at least a portion of the phenylpropanoid pathway and its subsequent recruitment for a novel flower specific pathway . identification of the substrate of any of these enzymes should lead to the elucidation of this 'phenylpropanoid-like pathway'.

in summary, these examples show that co-expression analysis combined with pathway mapping of co-expressed genes is a powerful tool to identify genes encoding enzymes acting in the same biochemical pathway. as a proof of concept, the majority of known p450s were placed in the expected pathway. but the approach also provides leads to novel pathways for a large set of orphan p450s.

p450s related to plastidial activity 
one of the most striking features revealed by the co-expression analysis is an unexpectedly large subset of p <dig> genes being mapped to pathways identified as 'plastidial isoprenoids' , 'photosystems' , 'photosynthesis' , and 'biogenesis of the chloroplast' . at the 'cypedia' homepage follow the link 'browse pathways' and 'cyp => pathway' to the corresponding database for detailed information. their pathway predictions scores, frequently far above  <dig>  are the highest of the whole analysis. those include cyp97a <dig> and cyp97c <dig> that were recently shown to be involved in the hydroxylation of the Î²- and Îµ-rings of carotenoids  <cit> , but also as many as  <dig> other still orphan p <dig> genes.

all these genes show very similar expression patterns, as exemplified in figure  <dig>  for cyp97a <dig>  with very high expression in all green tissues. they also frequently show down-regulation upon pathogen attack in leaf tissues . eleven of them are predicted to have a plastidial localization based on a chlorop prediction. based on manual assessment, schuler and co-workers identified eleven p450s to be likely localized to the plastids  <cit> ; seven of these are among the group with predicted plastidial activity. this may suggest that the role of p <dig> oxygenases in the metabolism of plastidial terpenoid derivatives, such as carotenoids, chlorophyll prosthetic group, tocopherols, phyllo- and plastoquinones, was so far overlooked. it may also indicate that a number of plant p <dig> enzymes have functions related to primary photosynthetic metabolism for the synthesis of antioxidants, plastidial structural components, signaling molecules related to energetic metabolism or light perception. the latter case is illustrated by cyp90a <dig> that shows the typical expression pattern depicted in figure  <dig>  cyp90a <dig> catalyzes the 23-hydroxylation step in the biosynthesis of brassinosteroids  <cit>  and was recently reported to be under diurnal light-dependent control  <cit> . on the other hand, some p <dig> in this group may have house-keeping function or be involved in the biosynthesis of constitutive natural products, which are spatially and temporally coupled to energy production and active plant growth. cyp86a <dig>  which was recently described as involved in the biosynthesis of cuticular lipids  <cit> , may be representative of this latter category.

candidate p450s acting on triterpenoid compounds
terpenoids are c <dig> isoprene-derived compounds which form the largest and most diverse class of natural products. in plants, they play important roles in development and adaptation via hormones and antioxidants, but most of them are mediators of antagonistic or beneficial interactions with other organisms, such as defense against pathogens or attraction of pollinating insects  <cit> . among these, triterpenes are produced from  <dig> -oxidosqalene by triterpene synthases  encoded by  <dig> genes  in a. thaliana  <cit> . each ttps produces a unique set of terpenoids, which may then be further modulated, e.g. hydroxylated, by p450s to generate the plethora of decorated triterpenoid compounds. while many ttps genes have been characterized, only one p <dig> involved in triterpenoid modification has been identified  <cit> . our pathway mapping approach identified  <dig> p450s as co-expressed with genes placed in the category 'triterpene, sterol, and brassinosteroid metabolism'  among them  <dig> belonging into the category 'triterpene biosynthesis' . in order to further identify individual pairs of ttps and p <dig> genes possibly acting in concert, we calculated, for each expression data set, correlation coefficients comparing expression vectors of each ttps with each p <dig>  for seven of the ttps genes, up to six tightly co-expressed p450s  were identified . a total of  <dig> p450s  are co-expressed with at least one ttps in at least one of the datasets. none of these p450s has been characterized to date. seven of these belong to the cyp <dig> family, while no other family is represented by more than two co-expressed genes, indicating a particular role for this family in triterpenoid modulation, which may be driven by cyp705/ttps co-evolution.

for each ttps, all p450s are shown that have an r-value of more than  <dig>  in at least one data set with the given ttps.

the strongest correlations were found for ttps <dig> and ttps <dig> . ttps <dig>  catalyzes the cyclization of  <dig> -epoxysqualene to form the tricyclic triterpene thalianol  <cit> , while mrn <dig> catalyzes an atypical epoxysqualene cyclization into a monocyclic iridal triterpene named marneral  <cit> . neither product nor further metabolites have yet been identified in planta. related iridal triterpenoids were however described in iridaceae. mrn <dig> and ttps <dig> share an overlapping expression pattern with the same set of four p450s in all data sets, though most pronounced in the organ data . they are highly expressed in roots, seedlings , and some cell cultures. within the cluster, cyp705a <dig> and cyp708a <dig> are expressed more similar to ttps <dig>  while cyp705a <dig> and cyp71a <dig> share a more similar organ pattern with mrn <dig>  being expressed mainly in more mature root samples . likewise, this gene set forms a separate cluster in the hormone data set, with induced expression upon cytokinin  and mej treatments, with again the same sub-clustering . mrn <dig> is not stress responsive , but ttps <dig>  cyp705a <dig> and cyp708a <dig> form a clear cluster characterized by induced expression in roots upon wounding, drought, and some other stressors, although r-values are comparatively low . the whole group forms again a strong cluster in the mutant data set with a typical expression pattern. it displays repressed expression in det <dig> and ga <dig> mutants , which are blocked in the biosynthesis of brassinosteroids and gibberellic acid, respectively  <cit> . it appears thus that blockage of hormone pathways branching upstream of ttps action results in down-regulation of these pathways as well.

in summary, two subgroups of strongly co-regulated genes were identified. among them, cyp705a <dig> and cyp708a <dig> are good candidates for catalyzing further modifications, possibly sequential hydroxylations, of thalianol to form a stress responsive, root specific triterpenoid. while this manuscript was under evaluation, this prediction was fully confirmed by the functional characterization of the thalianol pathway by fields and osbourn  <cit> . their characterization of this pathway was guided by an operon-like physical clustering of the co-expressed genes. cyp705a <dig> and cyp71a <dig>  on the other hand, are more likely involved in modifications of marneral to form a triterpene iridoid derivative, similar to multi-hydroxylated iridoids so far considered as characteristic of iridaceae  <cit> . equally consistent leads were obtained from the clustering analysis of other p450s related to triterpenoid pathways initiated by ttps <dig>  ttps <dig>  and ttps <dig> 

p450s related to plant hormone biosynthesis
cytochrome p450s play central roles in the metabolism of all classes of plant hormones  <cit> . our co-expression approach was in particular successful in the case of the octadecanoid pathway leading to the biosynthesis of jasmonate and other oxylipins. jasmonate is a well characterized stress response signal that also fulfills hormonal actions in stamen and pollen development  <cit> . both characterized p450s acting in this pathways, allene oxide synthase  and hydroperoxide lyase   <cit> , were correctly placed in the pathways 'jasmonic acid biosynthesis'  and 'lipoxygenase pathway' , respectively. however, additional p450s might be involved in the metabolism of jasmonate  and other oxylipins. in addition, a subset of genes involved in defense or plant development is expected to be selectively activated by the jasmonate cascade. indeed, as many as ten additional p450s are co-expressed with genes related to jasmonate signaling . table  <dig> lists correlation coefficients with jasmonate related genes for p450s, which have co-expressed gene in at least two data sets, and which have more than five co-expressed genes in at least one data set. four so far uncharacterized p450s share a common hormone-response profile with many jasmonate related genes , due to a strong and specific induction upon methyljasmonate treatment. these genes also share a common profile with jasmonate related genes in other datasets . phylogeny and in vitro functional analysis predicts most of them  to be involved in the metabolism of oxylipins  <cit> . for a second group of genes, correlated expression with the jasmonate pathway is especially striking in the organ data set . those are known or predicted to participate in the light perception/plastidial activity , or the biosythesis of glucosinolates . it is interesting to note that in the case of 12-oxophytodienoate reductases, opr <dig> is co-expresssed with most of p450s  in the hormone and stress data sets, while opr <dig> shares a similar expression with p450s exclusively in the organ data set.

shown are genes in the pathways, which have at least one co-expressed p450; only p450s are shown, which have at least six co-expressed jasmonate genes  in at least one data set. abbreviations of genes : lox2: lipoxygenase  <dig> ; lox3: lipoxygenase  <dig> ; loxl1: lipoxygenase like  <dig> ; loxl2: ; aos, cyp74a: allene oxide synthase ; hpl <dig>  cyp74b2: hydroperoxide lyase  <dig> ; aoc1: allene oxide cyclase  <dig> ; aoc2: allene oxide cyclase  <dig> ; aoc4: allene oxide cyclase  <dig> ; opr2: 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase  <dig> ; opr3: 2-oxophytodienoate reductase  <dig> ; oprl1/2: 12-oxophytodienoate reductase like  <dig> and  <dig> ; tat3: tyrosine aminotransferase  <dig> ; jr2: cystine lyase, jasmonic acid response  <dig> 

distinct p <dig> subsets were associated with various other hormone pathways . however, r-values are generally lower compared to the jasmonate related genes and co-expression is limited to fewer genes in the respective pathways. this may be due to the fact that metabolism of these hormones is less characterized, or, more likely, due to the relatively low and cell/tissue specific expression of most of the genes involved in these hormonal pathways.

in summary, the co-expression approach associates groups of p450s with specific hormonal pathways. the analysis is however more informative in the case of stress signaling which involves strong responses than in the case of low concentration hormones controlling plant development. it is thus expected to mainly support characterization of new stress signaling pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
the abundance of publicly available microarray expression data provides a stunning amount of information that has been exploited only sparsely to date. a correlation between gene expression and their biological/biochemical roles is necessary, and when genes encode metabolic enzymes acting in the same pathway, they are expected to be co-regulated. the data presented here covering known pathways largely confirm these assumptions. based on co-expression analysis of the complete p <dig> superfamily in a. thaliana we have generated novel hypotheses regarding biochemical and biological functions for a large number of individual genes or gene groups involved in common pathways. strikingly, the first validation of a new pathway predicted from our data was published independently during evaluation of this manuscript  <cit> , thus further confirming the potential of this approach. more leads will emerge from this analysis in the next years, supported by an increasing number of characterized genes functions. new hypotheses can now be addressed experimentally by exploiting the expanding toolbox of reverse genetics, such as insertion mutants combined with targeted metabolic profiling, and by reverse biochemistry using collections of recombinant proteins and medium throughput screening of substrate collections  <cit> . the same approach can also be extended to other gene families, including transcription factors, and thus has the potential to considerably accelerate the molecular understanding of plant natural product metabolic networks and regulation.

materials and methods
probe set selection and expression data of p <dig> genes
a collection of all cytochromes p <dig> from a. thaliana  and the corresponding agi  locus identifiers  were retrieved from the' place arabidopsis p <dig> database' . for  <dig> p <dig> genes annotated at place, no agi locus was associated. those included  <dig> annotated pseudogenes. two pairs of p <dig> genes were associated with the same agi-locus , leaving a total of  <dig> agi loci. these were used to identify corresponding probe sets on the affymetrix ath <dig> microarray using the 'genevestigator' probe selection tool  <cit> .  <dig> genes were not represented on the array. the remaining  <dig> genes were represented by a total of  <dig> probe sets, with  <dig> genes being represented by more than one probe set, and  <dig> probe sets representing more than one gene. using the 'genevestigator' probe selection tool we identified all genes recognized by these probe sets, and if more than one probe set was present for a given gene, we selected a single, specific  probe set for that gene. this resulted in  <dig> selected probe sets; of these  <dig> recognize a single p <dig> gene,  <dig> recognize two genes,  <dig> probe sets may hybridize with three genes and one recognizes four genes for a total of the  <dig> represented p450s, and three non-p <dig> genes . the probe sets used and the genes recognized by these probe sets can be found at the 'cypedia' home page.

we then retrieved normalized expression data for these probe sets from the 'genevestigator digital northern' tool  <cit> . data were downloaded in may  <dig> , covering  <dig>  microarray experiments, and in april  <dig>  covering  <dig>  microarrays. for each probe set, background was defined as the average signal intensity of all probes called 'absent' by the affymetrix software, and all absent probes were set to this background value. if replicate arrays were available, the mean intensity of all replicates was determined. each experiment was placed in one of the following four categories: i) organ and tissue samples from wild type plants, ii) stress treatment of wild type plants, iii) hormone, nutrient , and other treatments of wild type plants, and iv) mutant plants compared to wild type samples treated equally . signal intensities from organ and tissue samples were then compared to the background intensities, thus generating log2-ratios over background. intensities from both treatment groups were compared to signal intensities from the corresponding control samples generating log2-ratios comparing treatment with control, and intensities from mutant samples were compared with intensities from equally treated wild type samples thereby generating log2-ratios for mutants compared to wild-type. each dataset was divided into  <dig> expression groups using k-means clustering and the combined heatmaps from all clusters can be found at the 'cypedia' home page following the link 'view matrices'. for visualization of the expression matrices the 'heatmapper' tool at the 'bio-array resource '  <cit>  was used and the resulting heatmaps were incorporated into commonly used spreadsheet formats .

selection of metabolic genes
a list of genes related to any aspect of plant metabolism  was generated by retrieving all a. thaliana genes, which were annotated in the following databases: i) 'kegg orthology  â€“ arabidopsis thaliana'   <cit> , ii) the 'metabolic pathways' at 'the arabidopsis information resource'   <cit> ; iii) the 'arabidopsis lipid gene database'   <cit> , iv) the 'biochemical pathway knowledge database'   <cit> , v) a selection of publications devoted to the annotation of secondary metabolic pathways   <cit> . information from all databases were combined in one data matrix and affymetrix probe sets were selected for the set of unique genes as described above resulting in  <dig>  unique probe sets. for this set of genes, annotations were added that were derived from the 'functional catalogue' at the 'munich information center for protein sequences   <cit>  and manually curated 'geneontology' terms from tair  <cit>  ; nine points for genes with immediate biochemical function described as ida in tair-go, eight point for genes annotated as 'functional' or 'inferred from mutant phenotype' in 'acyllipid', 'biopath', or literature; seven points for genes with evidence code imp at tair-go; six points for genes with a described mutant phenotype, but with unclear molecular function; five points for genes with high similarity  to a characterized plant gene; four point for genes with high similarities to another plant gene, but function of that gene not validated; three points for genes with similarity  to a characterized plant gene; two points for genes with low similarities  to a characterized plant gene; one point for members of large gene families with low similarities  to a characterized plant gene.

co-expression analysis and pathway mapping
affymetrix expression data for the selected  <dig>  probe sets were retrieved and processed as described above for the p450s and the expression matrices were merged. co-expression analysis was performed as described earlier  <cit> . in brief, expression vectors were mean-centered and pearson correlation coefficients  were calculated between the expression vector of each p <dig> and those of the  <dig>  genes in the "pond" for each data set. subsequent manipulations were performed using the r environment  <cit> . for each p <dig> and data set co-expressed genes with r >  <dig>  were retrieved and the corresponding biochemical pathways were extracted from the pathway database . for each pathway, the number of co-expressed genes was counted and the sum of annotation scores  was calculated. the pathway was retained only when at least one gene in the list had more than six annotation points. the number and the score of co-expressed genes in a given pathway was compared to the total number and score of all genes in that pathway. based on a tailed hypergeometric distribution analysis only pathways over-represented in the group of co-expressed genes  were retained. subsequently, pathways identified in all four datasets were identified and the number and scores of genes found in each dataset were summed. the resulting tables were sorted according to scores and imported into an openoffice calc  template and thumbnails of the actual expression heatmaps, generated using the 'heatmapper plus' tool at the 'bar'  <cit> , were added and saved in html format. results for each p <dig> can be found at the 'pathway map' webpage for each p <dig>  expression data and pathway information data for co-expressed genes  were merged and sorted according to r-value. expression tables were color coded using the 'heatmapper plus' tool at the 'bar' and saved as static web pages linked to the corresponding pathway maps.

p <dig> expression data generated using a spotted microarray covering gene specific pcr products were retrieved from the 'functional genomics of arabidopsis p450s' web page . using this dual channel platform , signal intensities in roots from  <dig> week old seedlings  were generated by comparison to a 'universal rna' sample. this 'universal rna' consists of a mixture of rnas derived from roots and shoots from seedlings and leaves, stems and flowers from mature plants  <cit> . in order to generate a similar 'universal control' from public ath <dig> microarrays, we selected  <dig> shoot samples from seedlings,  <dig> leaf samples from mature plants,  <dig> root samples from seedlings,  <dig> whole flower samples, and  <dig> stem samples from the processed organ data set . we then calculated the mean log <dig> intensities over background form all samples and compared it to the mean intensity of the root samples and thereby created root/'universal control' ratios similar to those from the cyp-array. for the latter, not detectable intensities were artificially set to a ratio of  <dig>  compared to the universal control and ratios were log2-transformed. expression data for genes represented on both platforms were mean centered across the experiments. based on a linear regression model comparing the two data sets an r <dig> value was calculated.
