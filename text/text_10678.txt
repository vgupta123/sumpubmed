BACKGROUND
translational regulation plays a major role in temporal and spatial gene expression in a wide variety of situations. modification of translation initiation factors lead to global regulation that controls the translation of the transcriptome as a whole. modification of regulatory factors specifically binding to mrna motifs in the 3' or 5' untranslated regions  can modulate the translation of defined groups of mrnas  <cit> . accumulated evidence now indicates that mrna-specific regulatory factors exist as either multi-protein complexes, such as cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding proteins   <cit> , or multi-proteins complexes containing a non-coding rna   <cit> . we now know that mrna-specific translational control is essential for many biological processes including development, differentiation, and nervous system plasticity. reports on the existence of these translational control mechanisms have added another layer of complexity to our understanding of gene regulation but this has been little explored in the retina.

cytoplasmic polyadenylation was first brought to light in the 1980s, for its role in boosting translation of quiescent maternal mrnas during oocyte maturation when little transcription activity is present  <cit> . this emerging area has particular significance for the nervous system because it provides insight into the molecular underpinnings of synaptic plasticity. the existence of a cytoplasmic polyadenylation mediated control system became a subject of interest to neuroscientists about a decade ago when it was first investigated in the hippocampus and the visual cortex  <cit> . in this case, cpeb <dig> was shown to control the polyadenylation and translation of ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases α  mrna upon n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor  activation. four paralogous cpebs  have been characterized in mouse  <cit> . one of these paralogs, cpeb <dig>  is dendritically localized in the hippocampus and was shown to be co-immunoprecipitated with glutamate receptor subunit  <dig>  mrna. the knockdown of cpeb <dig> mrna with the aid of small interfering rnas  resulted in enhanced translation of the synaptic protein glur <dig> in neurons of the hippocampus  <cit> .

activity-dependent synaptic plasticity refers to the ability of neurons to change their synaptic strength and efficacy in adaptation to input. it can be embodied in several forms, including changes in the amount of neurotransmitters released from presynaptic terminals  <cit> , alteration in the composition, density or activity of receptors/ion channels on postsynaptic membrane  <cit> , re-remodeling of synaptic structure  <cit> , and an increase or decrease in the number of synapses  <cit> . synaptic plasticity has long been recognized at higher levels of the central nervous system , such as the cerebral cortex  <cit> , the hippocampus  <cit> , the cerebellum  <cit> , and higher levels of the visual system  <cit> .

recent studies of the neural retina indicate that it may share some of these characteristics of activity-dependent plasticity. for example, dark-rearing suppressed the maturational pruning of dendrites in the inner plexiform layer which normally occurs after eye-opening  <cit> . visual deprivation elevated the expression of several synaptic related molecules in the retina  <cit> . light responsiveness and oscillatory potentials were inhibited in both young and adult dark-reared animals  <cit> . the composition of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptor  in the retinal ganglion cells switches from predominantly glur2-containing in the light phase to glur2-lacking in the dark phase  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms controlling such events in the retina remain to be determined. a good candidate is cpeb-regulated translational control. evidence has suggested the presence of cpeb <dig> in mouse retina  <cit> , octpus retina  <cit> , and the expression of cpeb1- <dig> mrnas in embryonic xenopus retina  <cit> . the current study demonstrates the existence of multiple cpeb <dig> transcript variants in the retina. the presence of cpeb <dig> protein is also shown in this tissue.

RESULTS
bioinformatics analysis of transcripts and protein isoforms of cpeb3
a previous study characterized four different alternative splicing variants of cpeb <dig> transcripts  <cit> , in which two short motifs of  <dig> nucleotides  and  <dig> nt  are removed individually, or concurrently. however, the structure of cpeb <dig> seems to be more variable than previously reported. when investigating a nucleotide database  for cpeb <dig> variants, we were able to identify eight transcripts labeled here as transcript variants 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . with the aid of sequence alignment tools , we mapped each cdna to mouse genomic dna, and acquired the information related to alternative splicing. in addition to the two previously reported short sequences  whose presence or absence results in  <dig> variants  <cit> , several other alternative splicing regions were discovered and elaborated here in diagrammatic form . a similar search for the protein databases  identified six distinct cpeb <dig> protein isoforms labeled here as isoforms  <dig> through  <dig> . with the bioinformatics tool vector nti, we inferred the matches between cdna variants and protein isoforms, and designated the same numeric names to the matching transcripts and protein isoforms . transcript 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d all give rise to protein isoform  <dig> 

in addition to the previous reported alternative splicing regions  <cit> , one of the alternative splicing locations identified in the current study was near exon  <dig>  the prototypical transcripts have exon  <dig> immediately following exon  <dig> . however, transcript  <dig> has exon  <dig> extended, which causes a completely different 3' utr and the omission of exon  <dig> . as a result, the derived protein isoform  <dig> terminates with four unique amino acids  and is devoid of the second rna recognition motif  and the zinc finger domain .

another variable region identified here was located within exon  <dig>  a  <dig> nt partial exon skipping within exon  <dig> causes the use of an alternative translation start codon , resulting in the removal of the first  <dig> amino acids in the derived protein . interestingly, this deletion removed the 197th serine, which is a phosphorylation site of cpeb <dig>  <cit> .

while the splicing patterns described above could result in various protein isoforms, we found several other splicing patterns which would not lead to altered protein sequences but would rather lead to variance in their utr regulatory regions. for example, transcripts 1a, 1b, 1c use different 5'utrs . transcript 1d uses a different 3' utr . such variability is the result of differentially regulated transcriptional initiation and/or termination; it most likely leads to variation in the translational regulation of the specific transcripts. these interesting findings indicate the existence of a previously unrecognized complex regulatory control system for cpeb <dig> transcription and translation.

several variants including a novel variant of cpeb <dig> are identified experimentally in the retina. one of the variants is selectively expressed among different tissue-types
we next investigated the expression of cpeb <dig> mrna within the p <dig> mouse retina. regular rt-pcr studies demonstrated that cpeb <dig> is present in the retina . we further investigated which of the known cpeb <dig> transcripts identified through our bioinformatics analyses are expressed in the retina. the primer sets for rt-pcr were designed to span exon 5- <dig>  around exon  <dig>  and the partial exon skipping site within exon  <dig> . since one amplicon may correspond to more than one transcript , for our purposes, we named each amplicon as an alternatively spliced "pattern" with a descriptive name rather than a numeric name. for example, the exon 5- <dig> region has four patterns , and the exon  <dig> region has two patterns . the patterns within each splicing region are exclusive of one another. each pattern correlated to one or multiple transcripts. the correspondence between each pattern and potential cpeb <dig> transcripts were listed in table  <dig> 

amplicons of the pcr reactions were separated on agarose gel, and the identities of individual bands were confirmed by sequencing. our results from these rt-pcr studies demonstrated the presence of "+69+24", "-69+24" , "exon  <dig> extension" , the "exon  <dig> + exon 12" , and "partial exon skipping within exon 4" splicing patterns in the retina. additionally, a novel cpeb <dig> splicing pattern, "exon  <dig> deletion"  was identified in the retina. this was the first time this latter pattern has been reported and was named here as "transcript 7" .

in the exon 5- <dig> region, although only two bands were detected with rt-pcr, it is possible that more dominant transcripts "masked" weaker transcripts by competing for the same primers. therefore, we designed separate sets of primers for each individual splicing pattern in this region to further confirm their presence or absence . each specific band was purified and sequenced for confirmation. our results demonstrated that the "+69-24" and "-69-24" splicing patterns were indeed present in the retina . multiple tissues were used to determine the tissue specificity of the above splicing patterns. of all the patterns examined, the majority did not appear to differ with respect to tissue distribution. the only exception was the "+69+24" pattern, which was expressed in the central nervous system, ovary, testis, kidney and heart, but was absent in the thymus, spleen, lung and liver .

cpeb <dig> transcription is up-regulated during postnatal development of the retina
to investigate the expression of cpeb <dig> during development, taqman-based real-time pcr was used to evaluate the relative abundance of cpeb <dig> mrna in the retinas of mice at seven different postnatal ages . 18s rna was used for normalization. an amplicon of  <dig> nt spanning exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> of cpeb <dig> was amplified. this amplicon was inclusive of all known cpeb <dig> transcripts, therefore, represented the totality of the cpeb <dig> transcripts. the similarity of the amplification efficiency of cpeb <dig> and 18s primer sets were pre-validated by the manufacturer and verified in our laboratory . the level of cpeb <dig> mrna was significantly increased throughout the postnatal development and stayed high when the animals reached adulthood .

since cpeb <dig> has multiple transcript variants in the retina, we investigated which of the particular cpeb <dig> transcripts were up-regulated during the period of postnatal development using sybr green-based realtime pcr. mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig>  mrna, the transcription level of which showed little fluctuation during development in the retina , was used for normalization. mapk <dig> primers and cpeb <dig> primer sets specific for each splicing pattern  were designed in-house to generate amplicons of between  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp for robust amplification. similar amplification efficiencies  were reached under optimized conditions for all primers sets, allowing quantitative comparisons between cpeb <dig> and mapk <dig>  and among different cpeb <dig> splicing patterns . the data on seven different age groups demonstrated that all cpeb <dig> transcript patterns examined had similar trends of postnatal-related increases . this is consistent with our previous findings .

comparisons of the relative abundance of transcript patterns within each region  demonstrated that within exon 5- <dig> region, the "-69+24" pattern was the most abundant, and the "+69-24" pattern was the least abundant. within the region surrounding exon  <dig>  the prototypical "exon  <dig> + exon 12" was the most abundant, while both "exon  <dig> extension" and "exon  <dig> deletion" were much less abundant. of the eight transcript patterns, the three most abundant were "-69+24", "exon  <dig> + exon 12", and "partial exon skipping within exon 4" across all ages.

cpeb <dig> protein is regulated during postnatal development of the retina
we investigated the relative abundance of cpeb <dig> protein in the developing retina with the aid of western blots. two antibody-labeled bands with molecular weights of ~ <dig> kd and ~ <dig> kd respectively were identified in western blots and were both diminished by pre-adsorption with recombinant cpeb <dig> protein or by depletion of cpeb <dig> in hela cells . the ~ <dig> kd band could be isoform  <dig> or isoform  <dig> based on their predicted sizes. the intensity of the ~ <dig> kd band increased significantly during postnatal development of the retina, which was consistent with the postnatal increases in the level of cpeb <dig> transcripts . the ~ <dig> kd band could be a dimer, a pre-protein, or a prion form of cpeb <dig>  since the ~ <dig> kd band was not weakened in reducing and denaturing conditions , it seems less likely to be a dimer. the possibility of it being a pre-protein needs further evidence. the transcripts shown here do not indicate the presence of a protein larger than ~ <dig> kd, neither is there any such protein evident in the uniprot database. however, a previous study indicated the presence of a ~ <dig> kd cpeb <dig> protein  <cit> . with the aid of a different gel/buffer system and different protein standards, we have since found that the larger band appeared to be around  <dig> kd. therefore, it seems likely that the  <dig> kd band in the prior study and the  <dig> kd band in our study are of the same identity. we can only speculate that any transcripts for cpeb <dig> proteins larger than  <dig> kd are yet to be discovered. the possibility of it being a prion form  <cit>  also needs further investigation.

some of the transcripts identified in the current study did not show distinct protein bands in western blots. this may be attributed to the relative abundance of the transcript , or the variability in the 5' utrs and 3' utrs of the transcripts . it is likely that not all transcripts are translated with equal efficiency under the current paradigm. therefore, some protein isoforms may be expressed at very limited amounts, which are below the level of detection with the method used here. however, such isoforms may be expressed more robustly under other more appropriate, but unknown stimuli.

cpeb <dig> transcripts are expressed in the inner retina
with the aid of in situ hybridization and light microscopy we identified which types of cells in the retina express cpeb <dig> mrna in the p <dig> mouse. to ensure specificity, the in situ hybridization probes were designed in a region where little homology was found between cpeb <dig> and the other cpebs. a sense probe complementary to the antisense probe was used as a negative control. the results  demonstrated that cpeb <dig> was localized predominantly in the retinal ganglion cell  layer, and to a less extent, in the inner margin of the inner nuclear layer . it was not clear if cpeb <dig> mrna was also present in the plexiform layers due to the limited resolution of this technique.

cpeb <dig> protein is expressed in the retina
to confirm the expression pattern of cpeb <dig> mrna and to better define the cell types containing cpeb <dig> protein, fluorescence immunocytochemistry with an antibody to cpeb <dig> was used. a pattern was observed which was similar to that seen for the localization by in situ hybridization. cpeb <dig> protein was strongly expressed in cells located within the rgc layer, and to a less extent, within cells of the inner boundary of the inl . both the inner plexiform layer  and the outer plexiform layer  also showed pronounced immunolabeling of cpeb <dig>  to define the type of cells which express cpeb <dig> we used double immunolabeling with cell type-specific markers in combination with cpeb <dig>  the ganglion cell-specific marker microtubule-associated protein 1a   <cit> , and the cholinergic amacrine cell marker choline acetyl transferase   <cit> , were used. confocal microscope images indicated that most of the anti-cpeb <dig> labeled cells in the rgc layer were retinal ganglion cells , and a few were displaced amacrine cells .

discussion
this study demonstrated for the first time that cpeb <dig> mrna and protein were present in the mouse retina. multiple cpeb <dig> transcripts were shown to be present in the retina. the majority of the transcripts described here appeared to have a wide tissue distribution. a novel transcript of cpeb <dig>  was discovered and was present in multiple tissues including the retina. in addition, the "+69+24" transcript pattern had various tissue distribution and was expressed in cns tissues. the results also demonstrated for the first time that all cpeb <dig> transcripts were up-regulated in the mouse retina during postnatal development and reached maximum in adulthood.

cpeb <dig> variants provide for a higher level of regulation complexity than has been hitherto recognized
the large number of variants in the coding region, together with variances in the 5' and 3' utrs of cpeb <dig>  provides evidence for an unexpected level of regulatory and functional complexity of cpeb <dig>  first of all, the differences in cpeb <dig> protein sequences  add to the complexity of its function which may involve different temporal and spatial patterns. the alternatively used sequences may generate discrete "tags" that serve as hallmarks for localization of the protein, catalysis by discrete kinases/phosphatases/endopeptidases, or interaction with different protein partners. as a result, the activation, inhibition or turnover of cpeb <dig> proteins may also be affected. for instance, the 8-amino acids motif  presumably harbors phosphorylation sites for camkii, protein kinase a  and p70s <dig> kinases  <cit> . the functional significance of the 23-amino acids motif  and the 4-amino acids motif gewk  is unknown, but is of interest for future studies. the rna recognition motifs  of isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> of cpeb <dig> were altered, which would likely to impact their substrate specificities, similar to an effect previously proposed for cpeb <dig>  <cit> .

secondly, the regulatory properties of cpeb <dig> can stem from the differences in the 5' utr and 3' utr regions of the cpeb <dig> mrnas. for example, transcripts 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d all yield the same protein product, but each has a different 5' utr or 3' utr. the variability in the utrs is the result of differentially regulated transcription ; such variability in the utrs would further lead to discriminations in translational regulation. the utrs may also harbor signal motifs such as that for mrna localization or degradation, hence subjecting the mrna to distinct stimuli or degradation pathways. the mechanisms for the transcriptional and translational control of cpeb <dig> and the functional significance of the utr variants shown here provide fertile ground for future investigations.

cpeb <dig> may play a role in synaptogenesis before eye opening
the level of cpeb <dig> was up-regulated during the postnatal development and reached maximum abundance in adulthood . the presence of cpeb <dig> in the early ages may be related to a possible role during synaptogenesis. it is well established that the mammalian retina is premature at birth. the ganglion cell layer and the inner plexiform layer are recognizable at the time of birth, but the remainder of the retina is yet to be fully developed. the synaptogenesis in the ipl starts at day  <dig>  <cit> . robust glutamatergic synaptic formation occurs in the second postnatal week, and synaptic sublamina becomes visible in the ipl on day  <dig>  <cit> . the rate of synaptogenesis in the ipl drops precipitously at day  <dig>   <cit> . synaptic connections in the opl begin to develop on day  <dig> and are well established by day  <dig>  when the first light response was recorded as electroretinogram   <cit> . the synaptogenesis in both the ipl and the opl is concurrent with the increasing abundance of cpeb <dig> seen during the early ages. also noteworthy is the pronounced labeling of cpeb <dig> proteins in the ipl and the opl . this prompts the speculation that cpeb <dig> expression is important for the process of synaptogenesis; or alternatively, its expression is a consequence of synapse formation.

future studies on the interactions between cpeb <dig> protein and mrnas for synaptically relevant molecules, such as ampars, nmdars, camkii, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor  mrnas, can be employed to clarify this issue. for example, ampar is involved in fast synaptic transmission. glur2/ <dig> and  <dig> are expressed before the emergence of synaptic transmission, indicating a role of ampar in the establishment of retinal circuitry  <cit> . the onset and regulation of glur <dig> expression in the retina is in accordance with the process of synaptogenesis: it starts early in postnatal development, and reaches a peak before eye-opening  <cit> . the distribution pattern of glur <dig> in the ipl alters from a disoriented pattern just after birth to a laminated pattern prior to eye-opening  <cit> , manifesting the reorganization of synaptic circuits. the expression pattern of cpeb <dig> in the retina observed in our study does appear to be consistent with that of glur <dig>  thus, both are expressed in the same types of cells, and both are up-regulated in the first two weeks. given the previous notion that cpeb <dig> protein binds to glur <dig> mrna in hippocampal neurons and that glur <dig> is a potential target of cpeb3-mediated translational regulation  <cit> , it is plausible to conceive that cpeb <dig> also regulates the translation of glur <dig> during synaptogenesis in the retina.

in addition to glur <dig>  there are several other synaptically-relevant molecules that are localized in the rgcs and amacrine cells and are developmentally up-regulated, among which are ampar subunits glur <dig>  glur <dig>  nmdar subunits nr <dig>  nr2a, nr2b, and camkiiα  <cit> . a u-rich hairpin loop structure in the 3' utr of mrnas has been identified as the binding motif for cpeb4; such a motif was also recognized by cpeb <dig>  <cit> . although other possible recognition motifs for cpeb <dig> protein remain to be identified, the presence of the u-rich hairpin structure in the 3' utr of mrnas could serve as an indicator that these mrnas may be targets of cpeb <dig> regulated translational control. potential cpeb <dig> targets containing the u-rich motif can be explored with bioinformatics tools, and further verified with in vitro binding assays  <cit>  or in vivo manipulation of cpeb <dig> expression.

cpeb <dig> may play a role during synaptic maturation
anatomical studies indicated that the retina matures at postnatal day  <dig>  <cit> . although most morphological and neurochemical properties of the mouse retina  have reached the adult level at the time of eye opening  <cit> , the maturation of synaptic function continues for several weeks following eye-opening. the establishment of on and off pathways occurs to a large extent after eye opening. the dendrites of rgcs ramifies widely in ipl during early postnatal days  <cit> , but remodels into a predominantly monostratified form within sublamina a or sublamina b of the ipl in two to three weeks after eye opening  <cit> . the synaptic strength of the rgcs, measured as the frequency of spontaneous synaptic activity, is low around the time of eye opening, but surges around p <dig> both in spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents  mediated by glutamate receptors and in spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents  mediated by gaba/glycine receptors  <cit> . these maturational processes following eye-opening resonate with the continuing increase of cpeb <dig> after eye opening. whether such resonance is coincidental or interrelated is an intriguing topic for future studies.

cpeb <dig> and synaptic plasticity in the adulthood
both our real-time pcr data and western blot data indicated that cpeb <dig> continued to increase during development and reached its highest level in adulthood. these observations provide a strong indication that cpeb <dig> is functional in adult retinas. neuronal plasticity has been historically characterized as a feature of the developing cns, but several lines of evidence indicate that some forms of synaptic plasticity are not just the privilege of developing animals.

one form of activity-driven synaptic plasticity in the adult retina is described in the course of normal diurnal light/dark cycles. glur2-containing ampars undergo rapid cycling in the rgcs and amacrine cells via endocytosis and exocytosis  <cit> . synaptic quiescence in the dark drives rapid cycling resulting in the presence of ampars-lacking glur <dig> in the synaptic membrane. on the contrary, synaptic activity in the light period inhibits cycling and stabilizes ampar as predominantly glur2-containing receptors on the cell surface. such cycling of ampars is also present in hippocampal neurons and plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus  <cit> . although the underlying mechanisms for ampar cycling are yet to be fully deciphered, one may speculate that cpeb <dig> plays a role in this process.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the current study demonstrated that cpeb <dig> is expressed in the retina. the levels of all transcripts were up-regulated during postnatal development. we assume that all of these transcripts have corresponding protein products, but under the developmental paradigm used here, not all protein products were detected. it is possible that there are other paradigms which would lead to the translation of the other transcripts. this needs to be further explored. the variability in the protein-coding regions and the utrs indicates a remarkable degree of complexity in both the regulation and function of cpeb <dig>
