BACKGROUND
the prediction of protein coding regions in dna sequences is a major goal and a long-lasting topic in molecular biology, especially for the genome projects  <cit> . lots of methods for finding probable borders are based on strong signals between the coding regions and the non-coding ones  <cit> . staden  <cit>  used the intersection method to detect the borders between coding and non-coding regions. the information entropy measures for signals are useful for identifying the homogeneous regions and evaluating the genomic complexity  <cit> . the entropy-based segmentation methods can be used to identify the borders between coding and non-coding regions  <cit> . the jensen-shannon divergence measure has provided an impelling tool in doing this  <cit> . bernaola-galvan et al. presented an entropic segmentation method to search the borders  <cit> . the accuracy of their results was higher than those obtained with the intersection method  <cit> . the segmentation method presented by nicorici et al.  <cit>  was based on the jensen-rényi divergence measure in both dna strands. in  <dig>  zhang et al.  <cit>  introduced a segmentation method based on a r <dig> alphabet and the β-kl divergence. however, its accuracy is not higher than nicorici's method  <cit> .

in this study, we constructed a 22-symbol alphabet to represent dna sequences. based on the entropy theory, we used recursive segmentation to detect the borders between coding and non-coding dna regions. comparing to previous methods, it is shown that our accuracy was well improved.

materials and methods
the data set
three tested genomes were downloaded from the national center for biotechnology information : rickettsia prowazekii , borrelia burgdorferi  and e.coli .

a <dig> alphabet
the statistical properties of dna sequences were commonly used to recognize protein coding regions  <cit> . the statistical properties of doublets of nucleotides  in coding regions are also different from those in non-coding regions. this may be used to predict the coding dna regions. each di-nucleotide of the dna sequence is substituted by the symbols from a <dig> = {aa, ac, ag, at, ca, cc, cg, ct, ga, gc, gg, gt, ta, tc, tg, tt} .

the distribution of stop codon patterns  in dna coding regions differs from that in the non-coding regions  <cit> . it is well known that the scps are strong signals in dna sequences, so that we can effectively use these signals to detect borders between coding and non-coding dna regions  <cit> . the scps, tga, tag and taa appear in one given dna strand, and the three scps corresponding to tca, cta and tta appear on the reverse strand. in this way, the scps statistics on both dna strands is the same as the statistics of the six codons taa, tag, tga, tca, cta, and tta on a single dna strand.

in our study, we introduced a 22-symbol alphabet  that took into account the non-uniform distribution of di-nucleotides and scps in both dna strands . thus the di-nucleotides and the scps are substituted by the symbols from a <dig> = {aa, ac, ag, at, ca, cc, cg, ct, ga, gc, gg, gt, ta, tc, tg, tt, s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s' <dig>  s' <dig>  s'3}. the phase of the nucleotide is defined as m = mod 3)+ <dig>  where m ∈{ <dig> ,3}, and n is the position of the nucleotide in the dna sequence. the phase of a scp is defined in the same way with the exception that n represents the position of the first nucleotide of the given codon. for example, the dna sequence acgtaatc is converted using the a <dig> alphabet as ac, cg, gt, ta, s <dig>  aa, s' <dig>  at, tc.

detecting borders between coding and non-coding dna regions
in order to partition a dna sequence, we used the approach proposed by nicorici et al  <cit> . and li  <cit> . a sliding pointer is moving along the sequence. at each position, the pointer divided the sequence into two subsequences and we computed the jensen-rényi divergence djra. then, we found the maximum djra and computed its segmentation strength s . if this segmentation strength s exceeded a given threshold s <dig>  the position was identified as a significant cut  between coding and non-coding dna regions. the procedure continued recursively for each of the two resulting subsequences created by each cut until none of the cuts had a segmentation strength level exceeding the s <dig>  then such a sequence was segmented at the segmentation strength level s <dig> 

in this study, the jensen-rényi divergence  <cit>  is defined as follows:

  djra=maxidjrai=ra-inra,l-n-inra,r 

where ra, ra, l and ra, r are the jensen-rényi entropies of the whole, left, and right subsequences, respectively.

stopping criterion
to decide when the segmentation process has to be stopped, we adopted the method proposed in references  <cit>  and introduced a segmentation strength, derived empirically, as

  s=2⋅n⋅djra-k⋅log2nk⋅log2n 

the recursive segmentation continues as long as s ≥ s <dig> and the segmented sequence has scps in all three phases, where s <dig> can be set by the user. k is a constant, which was set as  <dig>  <cit> .

actually, the probable borders  predicted by the recursive segmentation method is generally not the actual borders but are close to them. since it is well known that the codons at the real borders between coding and non-coding dna regions must be one kind of start or stop codons, we could use start or stop codons like nuclear acid pattern around the border as border cut. then, we filter the segment region less than  <dig> bp. the procedure for finding borders between coding and non-coding dna regions can be described by the flow chart .

evaluation
in order to evaluate how well the predicted borders matching the actual borders between coding and non-coding regions, we use the following measure introduced by bernaola-galvan et al.  <cit> .

  cbc=12∑iminjbi-cjnt+∑jminibi-cjnt 

where {bi} is the set of all known borders  between coding and non-coding regions, and { cj} is the set of all predicted borders , and nt is the total length of the dna sequence. the first summation measures the discrepancy between pbs and kbs by adding the distance from each kb to the closest pb, and the second summation performs the same operation, but includes the distance from each pb to the closest kb. both are required to take into account not only the correctness for the cutting position , but also the difference between the number of pbs and kbs. cbc can be viewed as an average of the error in determining the correct boundaries between coding and non-coding regions, so  is a reasonable measure of the accuracy of the method.

RESULTS
in figure  <dig>  we plotted the jensen-rényi divergence  with a <dig>  <cit>  and a <dig> alphabets along a dna segment. the dna segment was randomly chosen from the bacterium genome borrelia burgdorferi and rickettsia prowazekii. in figure  <dig>  the analyzed dna segment was chosen from bacterium rickettsia prowazekii . the left part  belongs to a coding region and the right part  belongs to a non-coding region. in figure  <dig>  the analyzed dna segment was chosen from bacterium rickettsia prowazekii . the left part  belongs to a coding region and the right one belongs to a non-coding region. from figure  <dig>  the cuts predicted by a22-jr  are closer to the real borders than those by a12-jr.

we also applied the two methods to whole genome respectively. there are multiple coding and non-coding regions in those sequences. the results are summarized in table  <dig>  the accuracy of a22_jr is better than that of a12_jr for each dna sequence .

for visualizing the borders predicted by our proposed method, we plotted the known coding regions in the first  <dig> bp of the bacterium genome borrelia burgdorferi  and the unmodified predicted borders from our results .

finally, we described how to choose an appropriate threshold s <dig> of segmentation strength. after having gotten the cuts and their corresponding segmentation strength, s <dig> ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  stepping by  <dig> . for each s <dig>  the accuracy was computed. from figure  <dig>  we can find that the accuracy is much higher when s <dig> is about - <dig> . thus the appropriate threshold s <dig> of segmentation strength can be set as - <dig> .

in this study, we introduced a new segmentation method for finding the borders between coding and non-coding regions. it is based on the jensen-rényi divergence, a 22-symbol alphabet, and a new stopping criterion. tested on three bacteria genomes, our method improved the accuracies of the borders detection over the previously reported a12-jr segmentation approach. most of the existing segmentation algorithms  <cit>  rely heavily on statistical properties of the coding, non-coding or other interested regions in dna sequences. moreover, since the gene-finding systems  <cit>  use biological knowledge regarding functional sites, together with statistics for finding genes, they require extensive training on known datasets. the recursive segmentation needs no prior training. it should be noted that the value of the segmentation strength threshold s <dig> is generally set as - <dig>  for bacterium and may be adjusted accordingly in different species. for a new unknown genomic sequence, the optimal threshold s <dig> of segmentation strength or significance level can be computed using the genomic sequence of the same or the closest organism.

CONCLUSIONS
the borders between coding and non-coding regions are found more efficient and accurate will raise the vital effect for dna sequences annotation. this paper presents a new segmentation method based on jensen-rényi divergence with a 22-symbol alphabet, new stopping criterion for finding the borders between coding and non-coding dna regions in prokaryotes. for three bacteria genomes, comparing to a12_jr method, our method raised the accuracy of finding the borders between coding and non-coding regions in dna sequences. the success comes from the utilization of the di-nucleotides and scps statistics in all three phases along the dna sequence, and use of jensen-rényi divergence.
