BACKGROUND
on the basis of sequence similarity, glycoside hydrolases  have been grouped into  <dig> families  by the carbohydrate-active enzymes  classification  <cit> . in the case of poly-domain proteins each catalytic domain is considered separately. a family was initially defined as a group of at least two sequences displaying significant amino acid similarity and with no significant similarity with other families  <cit> . later, some related families of glycosidases have been combined into clans  <cit> . according to its definition, a clan is a group of families that are thought to have a common ancestry and are recognized by significant similarities in tertiary structure together with conservation of the catalytic residues and a catalytic mechanism  <cit> . glycosidases catalyze hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond of their substrates via two general mechanisms, leading to either inversion or overall retention of the anomeric configuration at the cleavage point  <cit> . currently,  <dig> clans  are described, and in total they contain  <dig> families  <cit> . families of four clans , as well as several other families, that have not been assigned to any clan, contain proteins with a similar 8-barrel fold of the catalytic domain  <cit> . several glycosidases, that do not have any homologues, are included into a group of non-classified glycoside hydrolases  <cit> . in several instances, proteins from this group have been reclassified into new families when their homologues were found  <cit> .

two different clans have never been merged in the cazy classification  <cit> , even after their significant similarity has been established. instead, related clans  having statistically significant sequence similarity of the corresponding proteins were proposed to be grouped into superfamilies at a higher hierarchical level. for example, we have described the furanosidase  superfamily, that includes clans gh-f  and gh-j , as well as the ghlp  family of enzymatically-uncharacterized proteins  <cit> .

nowadays, some families are very large. for example, gh <dig> family  includes more than  <dig>  representatives  <cit> . this large and poly-specific group of enzymes has been studied by many authors  <cit> . in particular, it was shown that splitting of this family into smaller subfamilies allowed to clarify the relationship of its members  <cit> .

the majority of known glycosidases with the α-galactosidase activity  belong to families gh <dig> and gh <dig>  that form clan gh-d  <cit> . this clan and family gh <dig> compose the α-galactosidase superfamily  <cit> . this superfamily has a distant relationship with clan gh-h  <cit> , which we have proposed to name the α-glucosidase superfamily  <cit> . both superfamilies contain proteins sharing the same enzymatic mechanism , a similar 8-barrel fold of the catalytic domain  <cit> , and use substrates only with the axial orientation of the glycosidic bond  <cit> .

gram-negative obligate anaerobe bacteroides thetaiotaomicron atcc <dig> is a commensal bacterium found in the human colon where it ferments a wide variety of polysaccharides  <cit> . its starch utilization system  has been studied in detail  <cit> . one of the corresponding loci  includes divergently oriented regulatory gene susr and seven structural genes susa-susg  <cit> . genes susc-susf encode outer membrane proteins are involved in starch binding. glycosidases susa  and susg  are members of family gh <dig>  <cit> . susb is an unusual α-glucosidase  that for a long time was considered a unique glycosidase with no homologues  <cit> . therefore it was included in the group of non-classified glycoside hydrolases  <cit> . we have found a group of its homologues among hypothetical proteins encoded by open reading frames , that recently were sequenced in the frame of several prokaryotic genome projects. we referred to this group of proteins as the ghx family  <cit> . in june  <dig>   <dig> members of this family were recognized in the cazy classification as the gh <dig> family of glycoside hydrolases. currently , family gh <dig> includes two α-glucosidases susb from closely related bacteria b. thetaiotaomicron atcc <dig> and tannerella forsythensis  atcc <dig>  as well as  <dig> hypothetical proteins encoded by orfs  <cit> .

in this work we updated the gh <dig> family of glycosidases, performed its phylogenetic analysis, and established its evolutionary relationship with several other glycosidase families.

RESULTS
collecting sequences of family gh97
psi-blast search of the non-redundant database with the bacteroides thetaiotaomicron α-glucosidase susb  as a query sequence yielded  <dig> protein sequences with the worst  e-value of  <dig> × 10- <dig> during the first round. among them we found  <dig> paralogous proteins from b. thetaiotaomicron atcc <dig> and their  <dig> homologues from other species. among  <dig> obtained proteins were found all  <dig> members of the gh <dig> family listed at the cazy server  <cit> . genomic blast revealed  <dig> additional homologous sequences. based on the sequence similarity, we propose to enlarge the gh <dig> family by including all known homologues of susb. as a result, currently this family includes  <dig> proteins. the majority of them represent eubacteria . three other sequences correspond to archaea  and two uncultured bacteria. four sequences are annotated in the ncbi database as eukaryotic  genome fragments. only five out of  <dig> protein sequences  are short fragments .

aaccession numbers of protein sequences are given according to the ncbi database  <cit> . numbers of nucleic sequences are given  if the corresponding protein sequences have not been deposited. in some cases , protein sequences were edited by changing the start codon.

bprotein length was established as the number of amino acids in the corresponding precursor. incomplete sequences  are asterisked.

psi-blast searches with a few randomly selected divergent representatives of the gh <dig> family used as a query sequence during the first round always yielded the same  <dig> protein sequences as with 97a1_bacth. an analysis of the order of the sequence appearance during the first round of searches by psi-blast, depending on the query, allows us to distinguish five subfamilies  in the gh <dig> family with at least two known members in each of them . the obtained pairwise alignments were used for generating the protein multiple sequence alignment of family gh <dig>  the most conserved parts of the alignment are shown on figure  <dig> 

the fragment of leifsonia xyli ctcb <dig> genome  revealed by genomic blast has  <dig> stop codons in the region homologous to genes of gh <dig> family proteins. an analysis of the nucleic acid sequence allowed us to detect a frame shift . the improved orf encodes protein sequence , showing a significant sequence similarity with the other members of family gh <dig> along its whole length . however, it was impossible to determine the very beginning of the protein sequence including the start codon. this protein is a divergent representative of the gh <dig> family and it could not be classified into any subfamily on the basis of pairwise sequence comparison. 97c1_leixy and its closest homologue 97d1_caucr  have only 30% of sequence identity.

a short gene fragment  from an uncultured bacterium was revealed by genomic blast. it had been obtained and sequenced during pcr screening of human gut microflora  <cit> . the deduced protein sequence  corresponds to the c-terminal part of the others gh <dig> family proteins and has the highest similarity level with 97a1_bacth  and 97a1_tanfo . it allows us to include this protein fragment into subfamily 97a .

psi-blast search of the non-redundant protein database yielded a unique eukaryotic protein fragment  homologous to gh <dig> family proteins. screening of the database of eukaryotic nucleic acid sequences uncovered the corresponding dna sequence , as well as three other short sequences . all of them had been sequenced during the mosquito anopheles gambiae genome project  <cit> . these  <dig> sequences were aligned for the identification of overlapping regions. aaab <dig> sequence is homologous to the central part of aaab <dig> sequence having 54% of identity at the protein level. the ends of aaab <dig> sequence are respectively homologous to one end of aaab <dig> and aaab <dig> sequences: 65% and 69% sequence identity at the protein level. thus, these  <dig> sequences correspond to at least two different genes. in total, they cover a complete bacterial gene encoding of a protein of family gh <dig>  taking into account i) a high similarity level of the  <dig> deduced protein sequences with bacterial proteins , ii) the intron-free gene structure, iii) an inability to map the genes on the mosquito chromosomes, and iv) absence of gh <dig> family proteins in any other eukaryotic organism, we suggest the bacterial origin of these four gene fragments. the bacterial origin could have resulted from a contamination of anopheles gambiae tissue used for preparing of genome library by mosquito bacteroides-like gut microflora. the evidence for such kind of contamination was obtained when testing the  <dig>  clones from a. gambiae cdna library  <cit> . it was found that at least  <dig> sequences appeared to be bacterial contaminants.

in order to enlarge database of family gh <dig> we performed screening of the so-called "environmental samples data"  <cit> . it revealed  <dig> nucleic acid sequences from the sargasso sea that are homologous to genes of gh <dig> family proteins. however, the majority of them encode only short protein fragments and many of them have a very high level of sequence similarity. among them we found only  <dig> full-size or almost complete genes . three additional "gene" sequences were obtained by combining overlapping gene fragments with almost identical sequences . hypothetical proteins  encoded by these  <dig> genes should be placed in the 97a subfamily, on the basis of sequence similarity . moreover, the majority of the incomplete genes encode protein fragments belonging to the same subfamily. only four  and two  protein fragments correspond to subfamilies 97b and 97c, respectively. one short fragment  cannot be unambiguously classified into any subfamily of the gh <dig> family. an analysis of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the latter protein fragment  allowed us to extend the protein fragment by using another start codon. the resulting protein sequence  shows similarity with the sequences of the other members of family gh <dig> along its whole length. however, it was still impossible to include this protein fragment into any subfamily on the basis of pairwise sequence comparison.

phylogenetic analysis of family gh97
to check the actual relationships of proteins within the gh <dig> family we performed a phylogenetic analysis using the obtained multiple sequence alignment. it is well known that phylogeny is the best basis for verification of subfamily structure of a protein family. in many works, where composition of a glycosidase family has been analyzed, the monophyletic status was used as the main argument for a subfamily description. among others  <cit> , this method has been applied to gh <dig>  <cit> , gh <dig>  <cit> , and gh <dig>  <cit>  families of glycoside hydrolases.

in order to verify our subdivision of the gh <dig> family into subfamilies we checked the clustering of the family members in the phylogenetic tree. the maximum parsimony  and the neighbor-joining  trees have very similar topology, suggesting the correct interpretation of the evolutionary events. when any subfamily of the gh <dig> family was considered as an outgroup, both mp and nj trees showed that all other subfamilies appear to form monophyletic groups with a high bootstrap value . it should be noted that there is no pair of subfamilies that compose neighbor clusters on both trees with significant bootstrap support. this suggests approximately the same evolutionary distance between each pair of the subfamilies.

the archaeal protein 97a1_halma is a clear outlayer in the cluster of subfamily 97a at mp and nj trees . the other members of this subfamily compose several subclusters, that include representatives either from bacteroidetes or proteobacteria phyla.

unclassified protein 97c1_leixy is the closest neighbor of subfamily 97c cluster at mp and nj trees  and therefore it can be considered as a divergent representative of this subfamily . phylogenetic analysis of 97c1_enseq protein fragment  allowed us to place it into the same subfamily 97c.

an analysis of the gh <dig> family multiple sequence alignment revealed a number of amino acid positions that are highly conserved within several subfamilies but varied in amino acid residues in different subfamilies . taken together, these signature sequence positions allow to predict the subfamily belonging of a protein sequence.

relationship of family gh <dig> with some other glycosidase families
depending on the gh <dig> query and the statistical significance threshold of e-value, during the second or third psi-blast iterations, as a rule, we detected statistically significant similarities with α-galactosidases. they represent families gh <dig> and gh <dig> of clan gh-d . more distant similarities were found with glycosidases of family gh <dig>  and in some cases with enzymatically-uncharacterized proteins from cog <dig>  cog <dig> has been annotated as a family of predicted fe-s oxidoreductases, like the closest cog <dig>  <cit> . our blast searches show, that both cog families are related to the radical sam superfamily of fe-s enzymes  <cit> , having 8-barrel fold .

when we used some representatives of subfamily 97a  as a query and an e-value cut-off of  <dig> , it was possible to reveal statistically significant similarity with glycosidases of family gh <dig> . a similarity with proteins of this family was detected after the second psi-blast iteration, while the next one or two iterations revealed a distant relationship with members of cog <dig> . it should be noted that glycosidases from the clans gh-d, gh-h, and gh-k have a similar 8-barrel fold of their catalytic domain and the same molecular mechanism of the hydrolyzing reaction  <cit> . thus, our results agree with the data of several authors  <cit>  showing the relationship of glycosidases from gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  and gh <dig> families. more detail analysis of these families and their relationship was done by rigden  <cit> .

using the α-galactosidases from rice  and lactobacillus plantarum  as a query sequence for psi-blast searches we found their homology with some representatives of the gh <dig> family  after two or three iterations. however, a statistically significant sequence similarity of gh <dig> family proteins with α-galactosidases is restricted to a fragment of about 100– <dig> amino acid residues . this fragment corresponds to the n-terminal half of the catalytic 8-barrel domain of glycosidases from the α-galactosidase superfamily  <cit> . this half of the domain is known to be more conserved than the c-terminal half  <cit> . therefore, we can assume that the catalytic domain of the gh <dig> family proteins also has a similar 8-barrel fold.

in order to check whether the whole 8-barrel domain is present in gh <dig> family proteins, we tried to reconstruct their secondary and tertiary structure. the swiss-model program failed to unambiguously predict the type of the tertiary structure. the 3d-pssm, gor iv, and nnpredict programs were used for prediction of the protein secondary structure. the results obtained suggest that the central part of the gh <dig> family protein sequences represents a typical and complete 8-barrel domain . the n- and c-terminal parts of the sequences, mainly consisting of β-strands, most probably form two additional non-catalytic domains with an unknown function. however, different programs produce contradictory results regarding the number and exact location of the β-strands . the non-catalytic domains of glycosidases from the α-galactosidase and α-glucosidase superfamilies are also predominantly composed of β-strands. at least some of these domains are involved in oligomerization and carbohydrate binding  <cit> .

3d-pssm searches of the pdb database with several gh <dig> family proteins used as a query sequence yielded the highest level of similarity with the gh <dig> family glycosidases . among other best hits we have found representatives of several other 8-barrel fold glycoside hydrolase families: gh <dig> , gh <dig> , gh <dig> , gh <dig> , gh <dig> , and gh <dig> , as well as some other enzymes with 8-barrel fold, for example bacillus subtilis inositol utilization protein ioli . these results are in agreement with the hypothesis about common origin of all 8-barrel protein domains, that evolved from an ancestral  <dig> half-barrel by a tandem gene duplication followed by a fusion  <cit> .

in all known glycosidases with the 8-barrel fold, the amino acid residues involved in the active center are located on the c-termini of the β-strands  <cit> , a similar location of the active site was found in many other 8-barrel fold enzymes  <cit> . it is well known that two acidic groups  are almost always involved in the glycosidase active center, playing the roles of nucleophile and proton donor  <cit> . their sequence location has been determined for several representatives of the gh <dig> and gh <dig> families  <cit> .

the asp residue, playing the role of nucleophile, is located on the c-terminus of the fourth β-strand of the barrel. this residue is highly conserved among proteins of the α-galactosidase superfamily  <cit> . the homologous residue in the gh <dig> family proteins is more variable, being asp in all members of three subfamilies  and gly in the other proteins , including 97a1_bacth and 97a1_tanfo . since these two proteins display the α-glucosidase activity  <cit>  we can conclude that a residue, set in another site, plays the role of nucleophile at least in some proteins of the gh <dig> family. it should be noted that we have found a residue on the c-terminus of the fifth β-strand in gh <dig> family sequences that is gly in 97b, 97c, and 97d subfamilies, but glu and asp in subfamilies 97a and 97e respectively . therefore, this residue can be suggested as a possible nucleophile in glycosidases of 97a and 97e subfamilies. as a rule, the catalytically essential residues are highly conserved among enzymatically active members of a glycoside hydrolase family, being either asp, or glu. the distance between the carboxylic groups of the nucleophile and the proton donor should be similar in order to keep the catalytic machinery. thus, the difference in the predicted nucleophile residue between 97a and 97e subfamilies is unexpected. however, this does not exclude the existence of a glycosidase activity in proteins with asp residue at the fifth β-strand . to illustrate, in the gh <dig> family the asp residue was experimentally shown to be the nucleophile, while several proteins of this family have glu residue at the homologous position and at least some of them are catalytically active  <cit> .

the proton donor of families gh <dig> and gh <dig> is located on the c-terminus of the sixth β-strand of the 8-barrel domain. it is outside of the n-terminal half of barrel, which can be unambiguously aligned with proteins of the gh <dig> family. however, on the c-terminus of the sixth β-strand of the predicted 8-barrel of the gh <dig> family there is an asp residue, which is highly conserved in all subfamilies of the family . we suggest this residue as a possible proton donor. taking into account another structure of the active center and significant sequence similarity of only a half of the catalytic domain, the current data do not support an inclusion of the gh <dig> family into the α-galactosidase superfamily.

as far as we know, 97a1_bacth and 97a1_tanfo are the only enzymatically-characterized proteins in the gh <dig> family  <cit> . all other members of this family have been found recently during genome projects and are encoded by orfs. genes of this family are represented only in a limited number of eubacteria from phyla actinobacteria , bacteroidetes , planctomycetes , and proteobacteria , as well as in a unique archaea . however, many of these bacteria have several paralogous genes. the most interesting case is that of b. thetaiotaomicron atcc <dig>  which has α-glucosidase susb  and  <dig> putative paralogues representing four gh <dig> subfamilies , at least two of the paralogues  are also expressed in vivo  <cit> . this human commensal microorganism is known as a bacterium with the highest number of glycosidase and glycosyltransferase genes  <cit> . taken together, these facts we can suggest that evolution of gh <dig> family proteins has been associated with multiple duplications, gene elimination, and horizontal transfer.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the sequence analysis allow us to distinguish five subfamilies in the gh <dig> family of glycoside hydrolases. the experimental data on the enzymatic activity are available only for two representatives of the gh <dig> family: α-glucosidases 97a1_bacth and 97a1_tanfo  <cit> . however, we suppose that the other members of this family may also possess some glycosidase activities. our data suggest that proteins of this family have a common evolutionary origin with glycosidases of the α-galactosidase superfamily. many genes, encoding proteins of the gh <dig> family, are located in clusters with genes of glycoside hydrolases and other carbohydrate-active enzymes. for example, 97c1_bacth and 97c2_bacth  are encoded by genes of b. thetaiotaomicron located at a hemicellulose utilization locus together with eight other glycosidase genes . taken together, these data support a recent suggestion to consider family gh <dig>  as a new family of glycoside hydrolases  <cit> . the evolutionary relationship of gh <dig> proteins with glycosidases of the gh-d, gh-h, and gh-k  clans allows to extrapolate their common most important characteristics to glycoside hydrolases of the gh <dig> family. we can predict a similar 8-barrel fold of the catalytic domain and retaining mechanism of the glycoside bond hydrolysis for glycosidases of the gh <dig> family.
