BACKGROUND
runx <dig>  also known as aml <dig>  is a frequent target of chromosomal translocations in myeloid progenitor cells  <cit> . the t chromosomal translocation accounts for approximately 15% of acute myeloid leukemia  cases and produces the aml1-eto fusion protein  <cit> . aml1-eto is comprised of the aml <dig> n-terminus, containing the conserved dna-binding runt homology domain , fused with almost the entire eight twenty-one  protein  <cit> . eto contains four conserved nervy homology regions  that bind different transcriptional repressive complexes including histone deacetylases and the silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor  complex  <cit> . all four nhrs are retained in aml1-eto, and early reports demonstrated that the fusion protein represses the transcription of aml <dig> target genes important for myeloid differentiation  <cit> . this repression is mediated, in part, by interactions between aml1-eto and the nuclear co-repressor protein   <cit> . recruitment of histone deacetylases  by aml1-eto and n-cor leads to a loss of histone modifications associated with transcriptional activation , whereas blockade of hdac activity results in partial differentiation of leukemic cells  <cit> . in addition, the acquisition of repressive histone modification marks, including h3k27me <dig>  is believed to serve as an epigenetic mechanism for aml1-eto mediated gene repression  <cit> .

the repressive activity of aml1-eto does not represent its full range of functions. the fusion protein has also been shown to activate genes  <cit> , and a mechanism for this transcriptional activation involving aml1-eto and p <dig> interactions has recently been described  <cit> . aml1-eto affects the function of micrornas , dna repair proteins  <cit> , and growth factors in myeloid progenitor cells  <cit> . the fusion protein also plays a role in epigenetic-controlled cell growth via interactions with rdna repeats  <cit> . in addition to regulating gene expression directly, aml1-eto interferes with the transcriptional activities of molecules important for myeloid cell differentiation via protein-protein interactions and acts as an organizer of cofactor exchange  <cit> . taken together, these studies showed that aml1-eto acts as a transcriptional regulator and modifies transcription factor activity via differential co-factor recruitment, properties that maintain the oncogenic character of t leukemic cells.

recently, genome-wide binding of aml1-eto, aml <dig>  and p <dig> has been determined in leukemic cells  <cit> . these studies have shown the following: global aml <dig> and aml1-eto binding sites largely overlap  <cit> , ets-family proteins recruit aml1-eto  <cit> , and that pu. <dig>  a master regulator of myeloid cell differentiation, is part of the t core transcriptional network. aml1-eto and the coactivator p <dig> co-occupy hypoacetylated genomic loci in leukemic cells  <cit> , yet the relevance of this phenomenon to t leukemia is not well-understood. in addtion, global interactions between aml1-eto and n-cor have not been studied. to clarify these issues, we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing  and determined genome-wide sites of enrichment for aml <dig>  aml1-eto, n-cor, and p <dig> in kasumi- <dig> cells, a model system for t leukemia  <cit> . chip-seq libraries for histone modifications associated with transcriptional activation  and repression  were also generated to assess whether epigenetic mechanisms account for the differentiation arrest phenotype in kasumi- <dig> cells.

from our genome-wide analysis of aml1/aml1-eto occupancy, we have identified and described a phenotypically relevant subset of putative regulatory sequences. these sequences are characterized by abundant n-cor co-occupancy, relative to other aml1/aml1-eto-bound sequences, and a significant enrichment in pu. <dig> motifs. moreover, using publicly available gene expression data  <cit> , we show by in silico analysis that genes associated with the aml1-eto/n-cor co-occupancy signature display significantly greater recovery of expression upon reduction of aml1-eto mrna levels than do other aml1-eto-bound genes. aml1-eto/n-cor co-occupied genomic loci tended to be distal from transcriptional start sites  and showed little enrichment in the h3k4me <dig> histone modification. finally, gene ontology analysis of genomic regions associated with aml1-eto/n-cor enrichment was more relevant to the differentiation block exhibited by kasumi- <dig> cells compared to those regions enriched in aml1-eto/p <dig>  thus, although aml1-eto both represses and activates genes at the single-gene level  <cit> , our genome-wide data show that aml1-eto predominatly acts as a repressor. our studies provide a new understanding of the global mechanisms that regulate the t leukemic phenotype.

RESULTS
aml1-eto associates preferentially with the co-repressor n-cor
chip-seq studies were performed to identify aml <dig> and aml1-eto binding regions globally in the kasumi- <dig> cell genome. in addition, chip libraries for molecular indicators of transcriptional activation  and transcriptional repression  were generated. prior to library preparation, antibodies were validated through western blot and chip-pcr experiments . for example, a known aml <dig> binding region within the runx1p <dig> promoter  <cit>  was significantly enriched in aml1-eto chip samples compared to igg control samples . this finding was confirmed in our chip-seq data, as sequence tag density showed strong aml1-eto binding at the runx1p <dig> site and negligible binding at a negative control phox region . chip-seq data for aml <dig> yielded a similar binding profile at the runx <dig> promoter . an aml <dig> antibody that recognizes the c-terminus of runx <dig>  and therefore does not pull down aml1-eto, was used in chip-seq library preparations.figure  <dig> chip-seq analysis reveals global protein co-occupancy in kasumi- <dig> cells. tag density plots of normalized chip-seq data  showing aml <dig> and aml1-eto occupancy at runx1p <dig> promoter  and negative control phox  loci. tags were normalized to  <dig> reads. images were taken from the ucsc genome browser  <cit> . asterisks indicate the positions of hrunx1p <dig> and hphox regions tested in chip-pcr studies.  two-way and three-way venn diagrams displaying co-occupancy and unique regions among aml <dig>  aml1-eto, n-cor, and p <dig> libraries. all peaks were generated by macs using a p < 10− <dig> significance cutoff. total peak numbers are displayed in parentheses.  tag density plots displaying enrichment of aml1-eto and n-cor at regions corresponding to known fusion protein target genes that are repressed in kasumi- <dig> cells.



model-based analysis of chip-seq data  was used to identify protein binding or enrichment regions  for histone modifications, aml1-eto and associated co-regulators in the kasumi- <dig> genome . aml1-eto was enriched at genes that are known to be regulated by the fusion protein  <cit> , underscoring the quality of our chip-seq data . approximately 71% of aml <dig> peaks overlapped with those of aml1-eto . this result was expected, as aml1-eto retains the dna-binding rhd found in wild-type runx <dig>  interestingly, 39% of aml1-eto peaks overlap those of n-cor, whereas only 22% of aml1-eto peaks overlap those of p <dig> . a similar profile was observed when comparing the co-occupancy of aml <dig> with the two co-regulators. these findings are consistent with a correlation analysis of genomic occupancy from chip-seq measurements , which shows that aml1-eto and n-cor signals are more correlated with one another than either is with any of the other assayed dna-binding proteins, co-regulators or epigenomic modifications. a closer analysis of selected genes that are related to the leukemia phenotype and are deregulated upon sirna-mediated aml1-eto depletion  <cit>   further confirms an aml1-eto/n-cor dominant co-occupancy pattern that may regulate the leukemic phenotype at the genome-wide level .

to evaluate the gene-sets that are likely to be perturbed by the binding of aml1-eto and its cofactors, we analyzed gene ontology terms. chip-seq peaks with high statistical significance  from each library were analyzed using the genomic regions enrichment of annotations tool . enriched gene ontology terms germane to molecular signatures of hematopoietic and leukemic cells were similar among the aml <dig>  aml1-eto and n-cor datasets, but not that of p <dig> . importantly, ontology terms derived from genomic loci co-occupied by aml1-eto and n-cor were more relevant to myeloid leukemia than those from regions exclusively co-occupied by aml1-eto and p <dig> . ontology terms derived from regions that display enrichments of aml <dig> with p300/n-cor and aml1-eto with p300/n-cor resemble those of the fusion protein and n-cor . thus, aml1-eto preferentially associates with n-cor compared to p <dig>  and genes represented by these sites reflect the leukemic phenotype of kasumi- <dig> cells.figure  <dig> aml1-eto and n-cor peaks relate to similar gene ontology terms and motifs discovered de novo.  gene ontology was used to infer biologically relevant pathways among chip-seq libraries using highly-ranked peaks . shown are top-ranked gene ontology terms within biological process  and molecular signatures database perturbation   <cit> . values on column plots represent –log <dig> computed using great   <cit>  with the default association rules. note: some ontology term names were shortened.  homer de novo motif analysis  <cit>  of aml <dig>  aml1-eto, n-cor, and p <dig> libraries. displayed are the top-ranked motifs for each library with log scores. genomic loci occupied by aml <dig>  the fusion protein and n-cor were enriched in the runx <dig> motif. candidate transcription factors that harbor these motifs  are shown in parentheses.



transcription factors act in a combinatorial fashion to regulate gene expression in hematopoietic progenitor cells  <cit> . a similar situation likely occurs in kasumi- <dig> cells, where interactions between aml1-eto and distinct co-regulatory proteins at hematopoietic genes may be necessary to maintain differentiation arrest  <cit> . in our genome-wide study, de novo motif discovery revealed that runx <dig> and ets family motifs were most commonly associated with aml <dig> and aml1-eto peaks . ets family motifs  were also enriched in sites of n-cor and p <dig> occupancy . taken together, our data suggest that the differentiation arrest in kasumi- <dig> cells is caused by putative global aml1-eto/ets interactions and through the repressive activity of the fusion protein on aml1-mediated transcription.

pu. <dig> motifs are significantly associated with regions of elevated aml1-eto/n-cor occupancy and low h3k4me <dig> enrichment
to characterize further the relationship between aml <dig>  aml1-eto, the co-regulators p <dig> and n-cor, and epigenetic signatures, the mean tag densities for these datasets over regions  bound by aml <dig> and/or aml1-eto were clustered using k-means . chip-seq enrichments for h3k27me <dig> showed little correspondence with signals from all other chip libraries , yet this repressive mark was associated with some aml1-eto regulated genes including cxcr <dig> and hck . at genomic regions where levels of aml1-eto and n-cor enrichment were highest , enrichment of the activating mark h3k4me <dig> was low . this anti-correlation is expected on the basis that only a small fraction  of the aml1/aml1-eto-bound loci from cluster i are found at promoters of the ucsc known genes , whereas h3k4me <dig> enrichments are expected to be elevated at actively transcribed genes  <cit> . in contrast, cluster ii was characterized by an inverse pattern, where occupancy of aml1-eto and n-cor was lower  but statistically significant  and enrichment of h3k4me <dig> was high. the mean occupancy of p <dig> was similar among the three clusters . comparing our chip-seq data with h3k9ac  chip-seq data from ptasinska et al  <cit> , we observed that enrichment of h3k9ac was inversely correlated with our aml1-eto and n-cor occupancies . this inverse relationship between aml1-eto/n-cor and activating histone marks reinforces the idea that aml1-eto acts as a transcriptional repressor at many loci in kasumi- <dig> cells.figure  <dig> classification of aml1/aml1-eto genomic localization using co-factors.  heatmap of significant  aml1/aml1-eto chip-seq peaks clustered using k-means  with normalized mean  read densities for aml <dig>  aml1-eto, n-cor, p <dig> and the transcription initiation-associated histone modification h3k4me <dig>  following the color key, lowest read densities are represented in dark blue, whereas highest signals are in tan.  distribution of clustered aml1/aml1-eto loci among five classes of genomic elements. the y-axis represents the fraction of occupied loci among the each of the three clusters.  profile of within-cluster averaged aml <dig>  aml1-eto, and co-regulatory protein enrichments.  plot showing the fraction of chip-seq peaks containing the pu. <dig> motif as a function of total peak numbers for each cluster.



we examined the distribution of aml1/aml1-eto bound loci from all three clusters among genomic elements . aml1/aml1-eto occupied regions from clusters i and iii are gene-distal compared to those of cluster ii. yet, for each cluster the comparison with occupancy expected based upon aml1/aml1-eto binding with random sequences or sequences that match the aml <dig> motif revealed differences. for example, for all clusters aml1/aml1-eto occupancy at promoters and exons is higher than expected . as noted above, the occupancy reflected by cluster ii is much more strongly associated with tss-proximal elements than that of clusters i and iii.

the sequences with the greatest aml1-eto/n-cor co-occupancy  were compared with the remaining sequences occupied by aml1/aml1-eto  using a discriminatory motif analysis . the ets/pu. <dig> motif was over-represented among the cluster i sequences . the resulting pu. <dig> motif  was scanned across all aml1/aml1-eto-occupied sequences using fimo  <cit> , which demonstrated the relative enrichment of the pu. <dig> motif in distal, predominantly n-cor-associated putative regulatory sequences  and depletion in the proximal transcriptionally active sequences  . thus, aml1-eto/n-cor interactions likely perturb pu. <dig> function at multiple loci in the kasumi- <dig> cell genome, in turn contributing to the leukemic phenotype of these cells.

the aml1-eto/n-cor signature is linked to aml1-eto target gene expression and leukemia
in order to relate the aml1-eto/n-cor co-occupancy signature to phenotypic changes in gene expression, putative regulatory target genes were interrogated using publicly available expression profiling data from aml1-eto mrna knockdown experiments in kasumi- <dig> cells  <cit> . for a given gene, the t score is the estimated log fold-change between conditions divided by its standard error: we observe that p is shifted significantly to higher t for cluster i compared to either clusters ii or iii . this observation is further evident in the volcano plot , where genes associated with cluster i are over-represented  among genes with substantially altered expressiona. thus, relative to other aml1/aml1-eto-bound genes, those with the aml1-eto/n-cor signature  were more transcriptionally repressed and therefore up-regulated in aml1-eto depleted kasumi- <dig> cells. these results were recapitulated using a second set of publicly available expression profiling data from aml1-eto mrna knockdown experiments in kasumi- <dig> cells  <cit>  . in figure 4d, genes associated with cluster i are over-represented  among genes with substantially altered expression <dig> figure  <dig> genes associated with the aml-eto/n-cor signature have the greatest recovery upon aml1-eto knockdown.  the cumulative distribution of t scores, ct=∫−∞tpsds, comparing changes in gene expression for each of the clusters  due to reduction in mrna levels of the aml1-eto fusion protein  <cit>  is shown. for a given gene, the t score is the estimated log fold-change between conditions divided by its standard error: we observe that c is shifted significantly  to higher t for cluster i compared to either clusters ii or iii. the inset shows the probability distributions, p, for each cluster.  volcano plot of expression differences due to rnai mediated knockdown of aml1-eto  <cit>  showing genes from each of the clusters. the horizontal axis shows log <dig>  with vertical lines indicating cutoffs of 2-fold in either direction. the upper panel displays the distributions of log <dig> for each of the clusters, again with a significant shift  to higher fold-changes for cluster i, relative to the other two clusters.  distributions of t scores, as in  using expression profiling data collected over several time-points in kasumi- <dig> cells under knockdown of the aml1-eto mrna  <cit> . we observe that c is shifted significantly  to higher t for cluster i compared to either clusters ii or iii.  volcano plot of expression differences due to knockdown of aml1-eto  <cit>  showing genes from each of the clusters. the upper panel displays the distributions of log <dig> for each of the clusters, again with a significant shift  to higher fold-changes for cluster i, relative to the other two clusters.



because we have observed a clear relationship between aml1-eto/n-cor co-localization and sirna-induced abrogation of the leukemic phenotype in kasumi- <dig> cells , it is worthwhile to compare the genes linked with different patterns of aml1/aml1-eto/co-factor occupancy with those from gene ontology terms. we find that the aml1-eto/n-cor signature is associated with phenotypic terms including “myeloid cell differentiation”, while clusters ii and iii are more associated with normal cellular function . taken together, gene expression and ontology data suggest that the aml1-eto/n-cor signature establishes the leukemic phenotype.figure  <dig> ontologies for shared aml1-eto and n-cor genomic regions are relevant to leukemia. gene ontology categories  with associated top-ranked terms are shown for each cluster. values on column plots represent –log <dig>  computed using great  <cit>   with the default association rules. note: some ontology term names were shortened.



discussion
our chip-seq data demonstrate that aml1-eto binding regions are more correlated with n-cor in kasumi- <dig> cells than any other assayed proteins, including p <dig>  using chip  studies in kasumi- <dig> cells, ptasinska et al determined that aml1-eto preferentially recruits the co-repressor hdac <dig>  instead of the co-activator p <dig>  <cit> . this genome-wide study also revealed that aml1-eto bound loci are chiefly associated with transcriptional repression  <cit> . thus, the preferential association between aml1-eto and n-cor in our study supports the finding that many aml1-eto regulated genes are repressed  <cit> . in skno- <dig> cells, another in vitro model system for t leukemia, aml1-eto and p <dig> were also found to co-occupy genomic regions  <cit> , yet the relevance to the t disease phenotpye is unclear. our integration of chip-seq data with publicly available microarray data and gene ontology analyses demonstrate that regions co-occupied by aml1-eto/n-cor are more relevant to t leukemia than aml1-eto/p <dig> 

we found that genomic regions of aml <dig> occupancy largely overlap aml1-eto binding regions. a similar result has also been observed in chip-chip data of u <dig> cells over-expressing aml1-eto  <cit> . ptasinska and colleagues determined global dna binding for aml <dig> and aml1-eto in kasumi- <dig> cells  <cit> . although we used different aml <dig> and eto antibodies for our chip experiments, there is a very high correspondence  of peaks between the datasets . similar to reports of other transcription factors in hematopoietic cell types  <cit> , aml <dig> and aml1-eto largely occupy promoter-distal sites  in the kasumi- <dig> genome. these results suggest that these distal sites serve as platforms for aml1-eto to regulate transcription via long-range chromatin interactions. aml <dig> and fusion protein occupancy at distal sites may be important for maintaining chromatin structure and for scaffolding protein-protein interactions. approximately 20% of aml <dig>  fusion protein, and co-regulator peaks occupy the same genomic regions. these ubiquitous sites may reflect cell population effects and/or the different affinities of p <dig> and n-cor for aml1-eto. alternatively, co-occupancy of opposing factors, n-cor and p <dig>  may be an important mechanism for fine tuning chromatin at regulatory loci  <cit> .

chip-seq data have been used to identify putative protein partners via de novo motif discovery  <cit> . each of our libraries was enriched in ets factor motifs. a motif for one candidate ets family member, fli <dig>  was discovered within significant n-cor and p <dig> peaks . our data corroborate a recent report showing that fli <dig> binds regions similar to aml1-eto and that the fusion protein is recruited to ets factor binding sites  <cit> . although the aml1-eto/n-cor signature appears to largely account for the leukemic phenotype, myb-p <dig> interactions may play a small role in this disease phenotype. the myb motif was enriched in our p <dig> chip-seq dataset. interestingly, pattabiraman et al demonstrated that interactions between c-myb and p <dig> are important for initiating acute myeloid leukemia  <cit> . strikingly, ets/pu. <dig> motifs were over-represented in cluster i, implying that aml1-eto is potentially recruited by pu. <dig> and may be necessary for maintaining differentiation arrest in kasumi- <dig> cells. this assertion, along with the specific identity of pu. <dig> from among the highly similar ets-family motifs, was confirmed by ptasinska et al, who performed pu. <dig> chip-seq in kasumi- <dig> cells and found a high degree of overlap between pu. <dig> and aml1-eto associating regions  <cit> . because aml1-eto binds dna and also interacts with pu.1-bound to dna  <cit> , the fraction of aml1-eto peaks that represent directly versus indirectly bound dna is not known.

previous reports have demonstrated that depletion of aml1-eto in kasumi- <dig> cells resulted in global increases in h3k9ac occupancy, an epigenetic mark for transcriptional activation  <cit> . we examined genome-wide enrichment sites for h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig>  marks of activation and repression, respectively. aml1-eto mediated gene repression is believed to occur through an epigenetic mechanism involving h3k27me <dig>  <cit> . although this activity occurs at the lat <dig> gene  <cit>  and only on a subset of our chip-seq peaks, the repression characterized by local alterations in h3k27me <dig> is likely not the dominant mechanism in kasumi- <dig> cells. in contrast, h3k4me <dig> enrichments correlated well with those of h3k9ac  <cit> ; signals for both activating marks were reduced in genomic regions where aml1-eto and n-cor were elevated . hdac activity may decrease h3k9ac signals at these regions, a change that may be achieved by direct interactions between aml1-eto and hdacs or via recruitment of hdacs by n-cor. similarly, in transcription start site-proximal regions, h3k4me <dig> enrichment may be reduced when aml1-eto/n-cor occupancy is high.

given that the fusion protein occupies kasumi- <dig> metaphase chromosomes  <cit> , it is possible that during mitosis aml1-eto associates with chromatin regulators at novel genes that are critical for maintaining the leukemic phenotype. this epigenetic gene bookmarking mechanism has been described for runx <dig> in osteoblastic cells  <cit>  and for pcg proteins in drosophila s <dig> cells  <cit> . future work on purified populations of mitotic kasumi- <dig> cells will shed light on whether aml1-eto participates in gene bookmarking.

collectively, our data have revealed a global aml1-eto/n-cor signature with two key properties: occupancy of promoter-distal regions of aml1-eto-regulated genes, and enrichment for myeloid-related ets factors. genes within this regulatory network define the disease phenotype of t leukemia and are potential therapeutic targets.

CONCLUSIONS
findings presented here establish a novel t aml leukemia signature characterized by occupancy of aml1-eto/n-cor at promoter-distal genomic regions enriched in motifs for myeloid differentiation factors. these findings are significant because a genome-wide mechanism for aml1-eto mediated block in myeloid differentiation remains poorly understood. results reported in this study provide insight into genome-wide mechanisms that contribute to the disease phenotype of the t carrying leukemia.
