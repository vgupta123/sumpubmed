BACKGROUND
chlamydophila pneumoniae is an important human respiratory pathogen that causes laryngitis, pharyngitis, bronchitis and community acquired pneumonia  <cit>  and has been associated with exacerbation of asthma  <cit> , atherosclerosis  <cit> , arthritis  <cit> , alzheimer's disease  <cit>  and multiple sclerosis  <cit> . the ability of c. pneumoniae to remain viable within lung macrophages  <cit>  provides a mechanism for dissemination of chlamydia to other anatomical sites that may include the arterial wall  <cit>  and the brain. rapid and successful treatment of c. pneumoniae respiratory infections is therefore important to ensure complete clearance of the bacteria in order to avoid infections elsewhere in the body. antibiotics such as azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, and doxycycline have been used to treat c. pneumoniae respiratory infections  <cit> . however, clinical isolates of chlamydia resistant to azithromycin and erythromycin have been reported  <cit> , and some chlamydial species including c. pneumoniae develop resistance to antibiotics in vitro  <cit> . furthermore, sub-optimal concentrations of antibiotics in vivo may result in chlamydial persistence  <cit> , rendering the bacteria refractory to further antibiotic therapy  <cit> , and increasing the likelihood of chlamydia persisting in the body for months or years  <cit> . given that persistent chlamydial infections may lead to chronic conditions there is a need to develop novel anti-microbials to eradicate chlamydial infections.

all chlamydiae spp. exhibit a developmental cycle that begins when an infectious elementary body attaches to and invades a eukaryotic host cell. during invasion the eb becomes enveloped by the host cell plasma membrane, ultimately creating an intracellular vacuole known as an inclusion, within which the bacterium undergoes replication. the eb next transforms into a reticulate body, a developmental process that is characterized by reduction of eb outer membrane proteins  <cit>  and dna decondensation. rb are non-infectious, 2- <dig> times larger than eb and metabolically active. division of rb occurs once every 2- <dig> hours for c. trachomatis and 6- <dig> hours for c. pneumoniae  <cit> . a hallmark of chlamydial replication is the expansion of the host cell-derived inclusion membrane to accommodate increasing numbers of bacteria. in response to an as yet unidentified signal, rb begin to asynchronously differentiate into infectious eb by transformation through the ib stage that contains partially condensed chromosomal dna. the end of the developmental cycle occurs when eb are released from the host cell following inclusion lysis, or extrusion of the inclusion into neighbouring cells  <cit> . in addition to the three developmental forms seen during the chlamydial developmental cycle, chlamydia may be induced to form persistent bodies, a morphological state not part of normal growth and development. the pb is an abnormally large form of chlamydia that occurs in response to interferon-γ  <cit> , antibiotics  <cit> , or iron limitation  <cit> , and is characterized by an inability to segregate into daughter cells after genomic dna replication. the arrest of the developmental cycle at the pb stage can be reversed when the inducer stimulus in the case of iron deprivation is removed  <cit> . in addition to interferon-γ, and conventional antibiotics such as β-lactams and macrolides, other compounds exhibit bacteriostatic activity against chlamydia in cell culture. these include selective cycloxygenase inhibitors, rottlerin and inhibitors of type iii secretion  <cit> . rottlerin is a pan-specific inhibitor of eukaryotic protein kinases and was recently shown to inhibit the growth of c. pneumoniae in hela cells  <cit> . rottlerin may interfere with activation of the host mek/erk pathway which has been shown to be necessary for chlamydial cell invasion  <cit>  and therefore indirectly cause inhibition of chlamydial growth. alternatively, inp <dig> , inp <dig>  and inp <dig>  inhibitors of yersinia type iii secretion, may target a bacterial-specific factor related to the type iii secretion system and directly abrogate chlamydial growth in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . the identification of novel targets may prove useful in the development of new antimicrobials effective against chlamydiae.

chlamydial genomic studies have identified three ser/thr protein kinases, pkn <dig>  pkn <dig>  and pknd. our laboratory has shown previously that c. pneumoniae pknd is a dual-specific protein kinase that autophosphorylates on threonine and tyrosine residues and phosphorylates serine and tyrosine residues of the fha- <dig> domain of cpn <dig>  a putative yersinia yscd ortholog called cdsd  <cit> . in this report we show that a 3'-pyridyl oxindole compound, a known inhibitor of janus kinase  <dig> , inhibits c. pneumoniae pknd activity. this compound prevented pknd autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of cdsd, a type iii secretion apparatus protein. when added to infected hela cells, the compound retarded c. pneumoniae growth and significantly reduced the amount of infectious c. pneumoniae produced suggesting that pknd plays an important role in chlamydial replication.

RESULTS
identification of an inhibitor of c. pneumoniae pknd protein kinase activity
we have recently shown that c. pneumoniae contains three ser/thr protein kinases  <cit>  and that one of these, pknd, phosphorylates cdsd, a structural component of the type iii secretion system   <cit> . in order to determine whether pknd plays an essential role in chlamydia development, we screened an existing library of  <dig> small molecule kinase inhibitors, including inhibitors of eukaryotic receptor tyrosine kinases and atypical kinases, for their ability to inhibit pknd autophosphorylation in vitro. recombinant gst-tagged pknd kinase domain  was pre-incubated with  <dig> μm of each compound and reactions initiated with the addition of kinase assay buffer containing mn2+ and atp. sds-page and western blotting followed by autoradiography was used to visualize the extent of pknd autophosphorylation in the presence of each compound. nine compounds  of the  <dig> tested exhibited some level of inhibition of pknd autophosphorylation when tested at  <dig> μm . of these nine compounds only one, compound d <dig>  a 3'-pyridyl oxindole, completely inhibited pknd autophosphorylation. fig. 1a shows a dose response for pknd inhibition. at  <dig> μm compound d <dig> reduced pknd autophosphorylation by greater than 50% . similar results were obtained with two different lots of the inhibitor. compound d <dig>  a pan-specific inhibitor of the janus kinase  family, did not significantly inhibit pknd autophosphorylation at concentrations of  <dig>  to  <dig> μm . similarly, two other jak <dig> inhibitors, compounds d <dig> and d <dig>  did not inhibit pknd autophosphorylation at concentrations of  <dig> or  <dig> μm .

compound d <dig> is atp competitive and therefore it has the potential to inhibit other chlamydial enzymes that utilize atp as a substrate. to determine if compound d <dig> could inhibit a chlamydial atpase, we examined its effect on the activity of cdsn, the t3ss atpase of c. pneumoniae  <cit> . the activity of cdsn was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  micromoles of phosphate/min/mg protein in the presence of  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm of compound d <dig>  respectively, compared with  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the absence of compound d <dig>  compound d <dig> did not inhibit cdsn activity suggesting that it may not be a broad spectrum inhibitor of enzymes that utilize atp as a substrate.

to assess whether compound d <dig> could be used in cell culture we first exposed the compound to reducing conditions similar to that found in eukaryotic cells, then tested its ability to inhibit pknd. equivalent volumes of compound d <dig>  and dtt  were mixed on ice for  <dig> minutes prior to testing in the kinase assay. compound d <dig> retained the ability to inhibit pknd autophosphorylation  after exposure to dtt, suggesting that it would not have decreased effectiveness under the reducing conditions of the cell cytoplasm. to rule out the possibility that the inhibitory effect of d <dig> was due to aggregates of the compound, we tested for inhibitory activity in the presence of 1% triton x- <dig> to reduce potential aggregates. compound d <dig> retained efficacy toward pknd in the presence of 1% triton x- <dig> , indicating that the inhibition was not due to a non-specific effect of compound d <dig> aggregates.

we recently identified cdsd, an ortholog of yersinia yscd, as a substrate of pknd and showed that pknd phosphorylated  <dig> fha domains of cdsd  <cit> . we therefore examined whether compound d <dig> could block phosphorylation of cdsd by pknd. compound d <dig> completely blocked the phosphorylation of the cdsd fha- <dig> domain by pknd  indicating that, in addition to inhibiting pknd autophosphorylation, it also inhibits phosphorylation of cdsd.

effect of compound d <dig> on the growth of c. pneumoniae in hela cells
the identification of a pknd inhibitor provides a new tool to study the role of pknd in the developmental cycle of c. pneumoniae. since pknd may play a role at various times throughout the  <dig> hour developmental cycle we tested the effect of several compounds including compound d <dig> on the growth of c. pneumoniae in cell culture. compounds were added to the cell culture media  <dig> hr prior to infection with c. pneumoniae and inclusions were visualized by immunofluorescent  staining at  <dig> hr. compound d <dig> retarded the growth of c. pneumoniae in hela cells  as indicated by the presence of very small inclusions at  <dig> h. compounds d <dig>  d <dig> and vehicle  did not have any effect on the development of inclusions judged by the presence of normal size inclusions. given that compounds d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> are jak <dig> kinase inhibitors, and only compound d <dig> affects growth of c. pneumoniae, jak <dig> inhibition is not likely responsible for the decreased chlamydial growth rate.

compound d <dig> exhibits a dose-dependent but time-independent effect on c. pneumoniae growth
to determine whether the effect of compound d <dig> on chlamydial growth is dose-dependent we added compound d <dig> to infected hela cells at  <dig> hr post infection at final concentrations of  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> μm and assessed inclusion size at  <dig> hpi. vehicle or  <dig>  μm of d <dig> resulted in normal size inclusions at  <dig> hr . compound d <dig> at  <dig> μm resulted in slightly smaller inclusions relative to dmso-only exposure while d <dig> at  <dig> μm resulted in very small inclusions . to determine if compound d <dig> exerts a time-dependent effect on chlamydia growth, the compound was added to infected cells at  <dig> and  <dig> hours post infection in addition to  <dig> hpi. under each condition inclusions were very small at  <dig> hpi compared to inclusions in cells exposed to vehicle  indicating that the effect of compound d <dig> on chlamydia growth is not restricted to a time prior to  <dig> hpi. these results demonstrate that compound d <dig> exerts a dose-dependent but time-independent effect on c. pneumoniae growth in hela cells.

compound d <dig> does not affect hela cell viability
since inhibition of c. pneumoniae growth could be due to an effect of compound d <dig> on host cell viability, we assessed whether d <dig> affects hela cell replication and cytotoxicity. uninfected hela cells were incubated in the presence of  <dig> μm compound d <dig> or dmso, and cell density was assessed at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours using a spectrophotometric assay. compound d <dig> had little or no effect on hela cell growth rate compared to dmso . we also examined cell cytotoxicity at these times using an adenylate kinase release assay. compound d <dig> exhibited the same level of cytotoxicity as dmso at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours, and only slightly higher cytotoxicity levels at  <dig> hr compared to dmso-exposed cells . therefore compound d <dig> had little or no effect on hela cell viability and the inhibitory effect of d <dig> on chlamydial growth is not likely due to a non-specific cytotoxic effect on the host cell.

compound d <dig> does not block activation of the mek/erk pathway
it has been shown previously that activation of the mek/erk pathway is necessary for chlamydial invasion of host cells  <cit>  and sustained activation of this pathway is required for acquisition of host glycerophospholipids by chlamydia  <cit> . to rule out the possibility that the inhibitory effect of compound d <dig> on c. pneumoniae growth could be due to an inhibition of the mek/erk pathway we assessed the level of erk <dig> and erk <dig>  phosphorylation in the presence of compound d <dig>  hela cells exposed to either  <dig> or  <dig> μm of compound d <dig> contained high levels of phosphorylated p <dig> and p <dig> map kinase following egf stimulation. hela cells exposed to  <dig> or  <dig> μm u <dig>  a specific inhibitor of mek1/ <dig>  were used as control and did not contain phosphorylated p <dig> or p <dig> map kinase following egf stimulation . this result demonstrates that compound d <dig> does not block phosphorylation of p44/p <dig> map kinase in hela cells, suggesting that chlamydial growth inhibition caused by d <dig> was not due to a non-specific blockage of the mek/erk pathway.

effect of compound d <dig> on the growth of salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium and c. trachomatis serovar d
since compound d <dig> could inhibit c. pneumoniae growth indirectly by affecting a common signaling pathway of the host cell, we examined the effect of compound d <dig> on the growth of another intracellular bacterial pathogen, salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium sl <dig>  compound d <dig>  as well as compounds d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig> and dmso, did not inhibit salmonella replication in hela cells , suggesting that the inhibitory effect of d <dig> was specific to c. pneumoniae and not the result of interference with a common signaling pathway of the host cell related to intracellular pathogens. to determine whether compound d <dig> was inhibiting a host signaling pathway or cellular function used by the chlamydiae spp. we examined the growth of chlamydia trachomatis serovar d in hela cells in the presence of compound d <dig>  compound d <dig> did not inhibit the growth of c. trachomatis in hela cells as assessed by if staining of mature inclusions present at  <dig> hr , indicating that compound d <dig> is specific for c. pneumoniae, does not inhibit c. trachomatis, and does not block a common signaling pathway used by chlamydiae spp.

compound d <dig> does not cause chlamydial persistence and does not block differentiation or replication
since the evidence indicates the inhibitory effect of compound d <dig> on chlamydia growth can be exerted early in the developmental cycle , it is possible that the inhibitory effect occurs at a specific stage viz. eb to rb differentiation or rb replication. alternatively, a block in replication could be due to the induction of persistence which occurs under conditions of limiting tryptophan or iron. to determine whether compound d <dig> blocks chlamydial growth at a specific stage, we used electron microscopy to look for various developmental forms. figs. 7a and 7b show representative inclusions at  <dig> hpi from c. pneumoniae-infected hela cells incubated in the presence of  <dig> μm compound d <dig>  these inclusions are smaller and contain fewer bacteria compared with chlamydial inclusions in the absence of compound d <dig> , consistent with results seen using if staining. all three developmental forms of chlamydia,  were seen in the presence of compound d <dig>  and no aberrant forms or pb were detected, indicating that the inhibition of chlamydial growth was not due to the induction of persistent bodies. these results show that compound d <dig> attenuates chlamydia growth by decreasing the number of bacteria present in infected cells.

compound d <dig> decreases the number and infectivity of c. pneumoniae progeny
to determine whether chlamydia progeny are infectious after exposure to compound d <dig>  a blind passage experiment was performed. c. pneumoniae-infected hela cells were incubated in the presence of compound d <dig> or dmso and the cells were lysed at  <dig> or  <dig> hr. lysates containing chlamydiae were either undiluted, or diluted in media lacking compound d <dig> and blind passaged onto fresh hela cell monolayers. compound d <dig> reduced the number of infectious chlamydiae compared with dmso alone at both times by greater than 90% based on inclusion counts . in addition to reducing the number of inclusions, compound d7-exposed c. pneumoniae produced inclusions that were smaller in size compared to unexposed cultures, consistent with results seen on first passage . these results indicate that compound d <dig> decreases the number and infectivity of c. pneumoniae progeny.

discussion
chlamydiae are obligate intracellular pathogens that have a unique biphasic developmental cycle. we have previously shown that c. pneumoniae contains three ser/thr protein kinases and that one of these, pknd, is a membrane-associated kinase that phosphorylates cdsd, a structural protein of the type iii secretion system  <cit> . in the present study we have identified a selective inhibitor of pknd and show that this compound blocks phosphorylation of cdsd in vitro, retards the intracellular growth rate and decreases the number of infectious c. pneumoniae produced following infection of hela cells.

to elucidate the role of pknd in the chlamydial developmental cycle, we screened a small library of known eukaryotic kinase inhibitors in an attempt to identify a pknd inhibitor. in this study we show that compound d <dig> is a potent inhibitor of c. pneumoniae pknd activity in vitro. pknd autophosphorylation and subsequent phosphorylation of the substrate cdsd were completely inhibited by compound d <dig>  when added to c. pneumoniae-infected hela cells, the 3' pyridyl oxindole compound retarded chlamydial replication. the restriction of the developmental cycle was not due to the induction of chlamydial persistence as seen with interferon-γ or iron deprivation  <cit>  since pb were not detected in inclusions when viewed by electron microscopy. compound d <dig> also decreased the number of infectious c. pneumoniae upon passage suggesting that the compound interferes with an essential step in c. pneumoniae development.

the mechanism of chlamydial growth retardation by compound d <dig> is unknown but an involvement of host cell jak <dig> is unlikely because the expression of jak <dig> is restricted to the hematopoietic cell lineage  <cit>  and hela cells do not express jak <dig>  the absence of jak <dig> in chlamydia-infected hela cells is supported by a recent study that failed to detect the induction or expression of the jak <dig> substrate, stat <dig>  in c. trachomatis-infected hela cells  <cit> . in addition, other potent jak <dig> inhibitors  did not interfere with c. pneumoniae growth in hela cells. therefore the mechanism of c. pneumoniae growth retardation in hela cells is unlikely due to an effect of compound d <dig> on jak <dig> activity.

our data also rule out an effect of compound d <dig> on the mek/erk signaling pathway required for chlamydial infection and intracellular growth. activation of the mek/erk pathway has been shown to be essential for chlamydial invasion of hela cells  <cit> , and sustained activation of raf-mek-erk-cpla <dig> is also required for acquisition of glycerophospholipids and growth by c. pneumoniae  <cit> . in our experiments  <dig> μm of compound d <dig>  did not interfere with map kinase phosphorylation in response to egf, indicating that compound d <dig> does not block activation of the mek/erk pathway and that interference with this signaling pathway is not the mechanism of compound d7-mediated growth retardation.

since protein kinase inhibitors are known to be promiscuous  <cit>  and compound d <dig> could inhibit a kinase or other enzyme required for the growth of c. pneumoniae, a similar growth inhibition by compound d <dig> might be expected for other intracellular bacteria. since compound d <dig> did not inhibit the growth of chlamydia trachomatis serovar d or salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium sl <dig>  an effect of d <dig> on a common signaling pathway used by intracellular pathogens is not likely the mechanism of c. pneumoniae growth retardation.

our results show that compound d <dig> inhibits the autophosphorylation of pknd and subsequent phosphorylation of c. pneumoniae cdsd in vitro and significantly retards the growth of c. pneumoniae in hela cells. however, our data does not allow us to state unequivocally that the reduced rate of growth in the presence of compound d <dig> is directly due to inhibition of pknd activity. our attempts to detect phosphorylated cdsd in vivo by mass spectrometry have not been successful as it is technically difficult to harvest enough cdsd protein suitable for this method. we are exploring other methods for detecting cdsd phosphorylation in vivo as the detection of the phosphorylation status of pknd or cdsd in the presence of compound d <dig> would allow us to make a stronger link between pknd activity and growth rate. since c. trachomatis contains a pknd ortholog we might expect compound d <dig> to affect c. trachomatis but this is not the case as compound d <dig> did not affect the growth of c. trachomatis in hela cells. however, the limited homology between the catalytic domains of the pknd orthologs in c. trachomatis and c. pneumoniae might explain the differential effect of compound d <dig> on their respective growth rates. we are presently initiating experiments to assess whether compound d <dig> has any inhibitory effect on pknd orthologs of other chlamydial species and to determine effects on bacterial replication rates.

electron microscopic examination of chlamydia-infected cells exposed to compound d <dig> revealed the presence of very small inclusions with significantly reduced numbers of bacteria. inclusions contained all  <dig> developmental forms including rb, eb and ib and therefore both replication and differentiation of c. pneumoniae occurred in the presence of d <dig>  albeit at a reduced rate. if inhibition of pknd is the mechanism by which compound d <dig> exerts its inhibitory effect on chlamydial replication, the presence of replicating rb in inclusions indicates that pknd activity is not essential for bacterial replication. in this scenario one could envisage a redundant or compensatory signaling pathway that circumvents the effect of compound d7-mediated pknd inhibition. alternatively, pknd may be involved in a signaling pathway indirectly related to replication and that when inhibited only slows the rate of replication. it is also possible that pknd is an essential enzyme required for replication, but is only partially inhibited in cell culture by the concentration of compound d <dig> used in our growth experiments. indeed, it is known that chlamydial isolates can be heterogeneous in nature and therefore a subpopulation of chlamydia may have been partially resistant to the effects of compound d <dig>  nonetheless, c. pneumoniae grown in the presence of compound d <dig> and subsequently passaged onto fresh hela cell monolayers failed to propagate and develop inclusions suggesting pknd may also be involved in the production of infectious bacteria. inhibition of pknd could manifest as multiple biological effects if there is more than one pknd substrate, or if the affected biological events are linked. more work is needed to elucidate the role of pknd and the exact mechanism by which compound d <dig> inhibits the growth and development of c. pneumoniae. these experiments, however, will be difficult to conduct in the absence of a genetic transformation system for chlamydiae.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a novel inhibitor of c. pneumoniae growth and development, and its biological effects may be mediated via inhibition of pknd. it is tempting to speculate that pknd plays an essential role in the developmental cycle of c. pneumoniae, which may include a role in replication and/or in the production of infectious progeny, but this hypothesis cannot be directly tested in the absence of a pknd knockout. the approach of using novel chemicals in cell culture to inhibit other ser/thr protein kinases of chlamydiae viz. pkn <dig> or pkn <dig> may prove fruitful in elucidating their roles in chlamydial development.
