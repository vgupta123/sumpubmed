BACKGROUND
gibberellin , discovered by dr. e. kurosawa in  <dig>  <cit> , is a classical phytohormone. it is a large group of tetracylic diterpenoids with more than  <dig> members identified in plants, fungi and bacteria  <cit> . based on the number of carbon atoms, gas can be classified into c19-gas and c20-gas, which consist of  <dig> and  <dig> carbon atoms, respectively. c19-gas, such as ga <dig>  ga <dig>  ga <dig>  ga <dig>  ga <dig>  ga <dig> and ga <dig>  are converted from c20-gas, including ga <dig>  ga <dig>  ga <dig>  ga <dig>  ga <dig>  ga <dig> and so on. ga <dig>  ga <dig>  ga <dig> and ga <dig> of c19-gas are biologically active gas in higher plants. ga <dig> and ga <dig> are saturated and are the main bioactive gas with relative abundance varying in different species and tissues, while ga <dig> and ga <dig> are double bond-containing gas with less abundance compared with ga <dig> and ga <dig>  <cit> . gas play vital roles in many diverse aspects of plant growth and development, such as seed germination  <cit> , shoot elongation  <cit> , leaf expansion  <cit> , flower development  <cit> , and fruit-setting  <cit> .

similarly with other diterpenoids, gas are synthesized from trans-geranylgeranyl diphosphate , an important intermediate diphosphate precursor produced mainly from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate via the 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate  pathway in the plastid. the formation of ggpp during diterpenoid biosynthesis also depends on the crosstalk between the mep pathway and the mevalonate  pathway operated in the cytoplasm, peroxisome, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrion  <cit> . ga metabolism pathway from ggpp to end-products can be generally divided into three stages  <cit> . in the first stage, ent-kaurene is formed from ggpp in two steps via ent-copalyl diphosphate  under the catalysis of ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase  and ent-kaurene synthase . ent-kaurene is further oxidized to ga <dig>  in the second stage, by two multifunctional cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases , known as ent-kaurene oxidase  and ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase . ko converts ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenoic acid via ent-kaurenol and ent-kaurenal, while kao converts ent-kaurenoic acid to ga <dig> via ent-7α-hydroxykaurenoic acid and ga12-aldehyde. in the last stage, bioactive gas are produced under the catalysis of ga 20-oxidase  and ga 3-oxidase  and can be deactivation by ga 2-oxidase  in plants .

genes involved in ga metabolism have been identified in various plant species, such as arabdopsis , pumpkin  <cit> , rice  <cit> , pea  <cit> , and maize  <cit> . cps, ks, ko and kao enzymes involved in the early steps of the ga metabolism pathway are usually encoded by single or few genes  <cit> . for instance, the rice oscps and osksl gene families consist of three and eleven members, respectively; however, only oscps <dig> and osks <dig> are responsible for ent-kaurene biosynthesis. similarly, in the arabidopsis genome, only a cps and a ks exist. ko and kao are members of the large p <dig> gene family containing  <dig> and  <dig> genes in arabidopsis and rice, respectively  <cit> . in arabidopsis, there are only one atko and two atkao genes. the number of rice osko and oskao is two and one, respectively. unlike the enzymes involved in stages one and two, ga20ox, ga3ox and ga2ox, which play catalytic roles in the third stage, are encoded by multiple differentially expressed genes  <cit> . arabidopsis has seven atga2ox, four atga3ox and five atga20ox genes , each of which exhibits a unique expression pattern and plays distinct developmental roles . for instance, atga3ox <dig> and atga3ox <dig> are responsible for bioactive ga biosynthesis during vegetative growth, while atga3ox <dig>  atga3ox <dig> and atga3ox <dig> are important for the development of reproductive organs  <cit> . among the five atga20ox genes, atga20ox <dig>  atga20ox <dig> and atga20ox <dig> are the dominant paralogs  <cit> . atga20ox <dig> is functionally redundant with atga20ox <dig> and atga20ox <dig>  while atga20ox <dig> and atga20ox <dig> play very minor roles in most developmental stages  <cit> . differential expression and distinct developmental roles were also observed for rice 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase  genes, which include eight osga20ox, two osga3ox and eleven osga2ox genes   <cit> . in addition to differential expression in organs, tissues and developmental stages of plants, the expression of ga metabolism pathway genes is also regulated by environmental cues, such as light, temperature and other stresses  <cit> . moreover, transcript levels of some, but not all, ga metabolism pathway genes are under feedback control . it includes inhibition of some ga20ox and ga3ox gene expression and activation of some ga2ox gene expression  <cit> .

salvia miltiorrhiza bunge is an important traditional chinese medicine  material widely used in chinese medicines. it mainly produces two groups of bioactive components, including the water-soluble phenolic acids and the lipid-soluble tanshinones. the latters are a group of diterpenoids sharing the universal precursor, ggpp, with other diterpenoids, including gas  <cit> . the biosynthesis of tanshinones from ggpp involves smcps <dig>  smksl <dig>  cyp76ah <dig> and other unknown genes  <cit> . smcps <dig> of the s. miltiorrhiza cps gene family encodes enzymes responsible for the conversion of ggpp to cpp, which is subsequently cycled and rearranged to miltiradiene under the catalysis of enzymes encoded by smksl <dig>  a member of the smksl gene family. recently, a total of  <dig> genes, members of  <dig> gene families involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, have been identified and characterized in s. miltiorrhiza through a genome-wide analysis  <cit> . of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> are involved in the formation of intermediate diphosphate precursors via the mep and mva pathways, five are members of the smcps gene families, while the other two encode smksls. analysis of ga metabolism and regulation may greatly help to demonstrate the role of gas in s. miltiorrhiza growth and development and the crosstalk between ga metabolism and tanshinone biosynthesis, which are very important for genetic improvement of s. miltiorrhiza. however, genes involved in the conversion of ent-kaurene to gas have not been systematically studied. in this study, genome-wide identification, molecular cloning and expression analysis of the smko, smkao, smga20ox, smga3ox and smga2ox gene families in s. miltiorrhiza were carried out. the results identified tissue-specifically expressed, feedback-regulated, stress-responsive and alternatively spliced novel genes, revealed multiple layer regulation of ga metabolism, and provided evidence for crosstalk between ga metabolism and tanshinone biosynthesis in s. miltiorrhiza.

RESULTS
prediction and molecular cloning of ga metabolism pathway genes in s. miltiorrhiza
in order to predict ga metabolism pathway genes in s. miltiorrhiza, we downloaded the deduced amino acid sequences of  <dig> arabidopsis and  <dig> rice ko, kao, ga2ox, ga3ox and ga20ox proteins from the arabidopsis information resource  and the china rice data center , respectively. blast analysis of the downloaded arabidopsis and rice sequences against the current assembly of the s. miltiorrhiza genome was then performed using the tblastn algorithm  <cit> . the retrieved s. miltiorrhiza genomic dna sequences putatively encoding proteins with more than 50 % identity to arabidopsis or rice homologs were predicted for gene models on the genscan web server   <cit>  and the ncbi blast   <cit> . as a result,  <dig> gene models, including one for smko, two for smkaos, six for smga20oxs, two for smga3oxs and eleven for smga2oxs, were predicted. among them, sixteen putatively encode full-length proteins, while the other six are partial.

in order to verify the predicted gene models and to obtain full-length coding sequences, molecular cloning was carried out using pcr techniques. the results showed that all of the predicted gene models were experimentally validated and full-length coding sequences of the  <dig> predicted genes were obtained . based on sequence similarities between the cloned cdnas and the known genes in other plant species, the identified genes were named smko, smkao <dig>  smkao <dig>  smga20ox1–smga20ox <dig>  smga3ox <dig>  smga3ox <dig>  and smga2ox1–smga2ox <dig>  respectively. the cloned nucleotide sequences and their deduced amino acid sequences may be found in genbank under the accession numbers shown in table  <dig> table  <dig> sequence features of ga metabolism pathway genes in s. miltiorrhiza

blast analysis of the arabidopsis, rice and s. miltiorrhiza sequences against the s. miltiorrhiza transcriptomic unigenes assembled from ests and rna-seq reads  <cit>  showed that unigenes could be identified for nine of the  <dig> cloned s. miltiorrhiza ga metabolism pathway genes. it includes smko, smkao <dig>  smga3ox <dig>  smga20ox2–smga20ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig> and smga2ox <dig>  no additional ga metabolism pathway genes were identified. blast analysis of the cloned cdnas against the non-redundant protein sequence  database  using the blastn algorithm with default parameters  <cit>  showed that the coding regions of smko and smkao <dig> had just been identified through the analysis of high-throughput rna-seq data and reported as cyp701a <dig>  and cyp88a <dig> , respectively  <cit> . additionally, smko  was also cloned from the hairy roots of s. miltiorrhiza   <cit> . it further verifies our results from computational prediction and experimental cloning.

ko catalyzes the conversion of ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenoic acid via ent-kaurenol and ent-kaurenal. the cloned smko cdna encodes a protein with the amino acid number of  <dig>  the theoretical isoelectric point  of  <dig> , and the predicted molecular weight  of  <dig>  kda . it shares over 60 % identities with kos in various other plants, such as sesamum indicum  and erythranthe guttata . phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> kos from  <dig> plant species showed that plant kos could be divided into three clades . smko clusters with egko, siko and other nine kos from seven species in clade  <dig>  atko clusters with ptko and other ten kos in clade  <dig>  while osko <dig> and osko <dig> clusters with tako and asko in clade  <dig> . the results indicate that the cloned smko encodes a bona fide ent-kaurene oxidase in s. miltiorrhiza.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of kos and expression profiling of smko. a: phylogenetic relationship of kos in aegilops speltoides , arabidopsis thaliana , castanea mollissima , coffea arabica , cucurbita maxima , erythranthe guttata , fragaria grandiflora , lactuca sativa , medicago truncatula , momordica charantia , morus notabilis , nicotiana sylvestris , nicotiana tomentosiformis , oryza sativa , pisum sativum , populus trichocarpa , pyrus communis , s. miltiorrhiza , sesamum indicum , solanum lycopersicum , solanum tuberosum , stevia rebaudiana , triticum aestivum , and vitis vinifera. the unrooted neighbor-joining tree was constructed using the mega  <dig>   <cit> . smko from s. miltiorrhiza are in bold. clades 1– <dig> indicate the three clades identified. b: fold changes of smko genes in roots , stems , leaves  and flowers  of s. miltiorrhiza plants. the expression levels were analyzed using the quantitative rt-pcr method. expression level in leaves was arbitrarily set to  <dig> and the levels in other tissues were given relative to this. error bars represent standard deviations of mean value from three biological and four technical replicates. anova  was calculated using spss. p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant. c–e: responses of smko to exogenous ga <dig> treatment. fold changes of smko transcripts in roots , stems  and leaves  of s. miltiorrhiza plantlets treated with 100 μm ga <dig> for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 48 h are shown. the expression levels were analyzed using the quantitative rt-pcr method. expression level in tissues without treatment  was arbitrarily set to  <dig> and the levels in tissues from ga3-treated plantlets were given relative to this. error bars represent standard deviations of mean value from three biological and four technical replicates. anova  was calculated using spss. p <  <dig>   and p <  <dig>   was considered statistically significant and extremely significant, respectively



like other p <dig> proteins, smko contains the p <dig> conserved domain . protein subcellular localization prediction indicates that smko contains a 15 bp secretory pathway signal peptide at the n-terminus, suggesting this protein is most possibly present in the endoplasmic reticulum . similar results were also obtained for arabidopsis and rice kos, including atko, osko <dig> and osko <dig> , indicating that the conversion of ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenoic acid is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum.

in consistence with the role of ga in plant growth and development, smko showed ubiquitous expression in all the tissues analyzed, with the highest in flowers, followed by stems and leaves, and the lowest in roots . the expression pattern of smko is similar to that of atko showing the highest level in inflorescence, less in elongating stems, and relatively low in both rosette and cauline leaves  <cit> . in order to know the response of ga metabolism pathway genes to active gas in s. miltiorrhiza, we analyzed the expression of smko in roots, stems and leaves of s. miltiorrhiza treated with exogenous 100 μm ga <dig> for  <dig>   <dig> and 48 h, respectively. relative expression was analyzed using the qrt-pcr method as described previously  <cit> . the results showed that smko was up-regulated in roots and stems of s. miltiorrhiza plants treated with exogenous ga <dig> for  <dig> and 24 h . no significant changes were found in leaves at all three time-points of ga <dig> treatment and in roots and stems at the time-point of 48-h-treatment , suggesting tissue-specificity of smko response to ga <dig> treatment.

characterization and expression analysis of smkao <dig> and smkao2
kao catalyzes the conversion of ent-kaurenoic acid to ga <dig> via ent-7α-hydroxykaurenoic acid and ga12-aldehyde. one oskao and two atkao genes were identified in rice and arabidopsis, respectively  <cit> . from s. miltiorrhiza, we identified two kao genes, smkao <dig> and smkao <dig>  smkao <dig> encodes a protein with  <dig> amino acid residues, while smkao encodes a protein consisting of  <dig> amino acid residues . both of them contain the p <dig> domain. it is consistent with previous results showing that kaos are members of the p <dig> family  <cit> . smkao <dig> and smkao <dig> share about 58 % identity at the amino acid level and are clustered together in the phylogenetic tree constructed with  <dig> kaos from  <dig> plant species . consistently, two kaos from other plant species, such as arabidopsis, helianthus annuus and pisum sativum, are also clustered together in the phylogenetic tree . it suggests that two kaos from a plant species are usually paralogous proteins. smkao <dig> and smkao <dig> were expressed in all tissues examined . the expression of smkao <dig> was higher in stems, roots and leaves than flowers, while the expression of smkao <dig> was higher in roots, flowers and leaves and less in stems . analysis of smkaos to exogenous ga <dig> showed that smkao <dig> was up-regulated in roots and leaves at all three time-points of ga <dig> treatment and in stems at the time-points of 12- and 48-h-treatement . smkao <dig> was up-regulated in roots at all three time-points of ga <dig> treatment, in stems at the time-points of 12- and 48-h-treatement, and in leaves treated with ga <dig> for  <dig> and 24 h . it suggests differential responses of smkao <dig> and smkao <dig> to ga <dig> treatment.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of kaos and expression profiling of smkao <dig> and smkao <dig>  a: phylogenetic relationship of kaos in aegilops tauschii , arabidopsis thaliana , castanea mollissima , cucurbita maxima , helianthus annuus , hordeum vulgare , lactuca sativa , malus domestica , oryza sativa , pisum sativum , populus trichocarpa , ricinus communis , s. miltiorrhiza , selaginella moellendorffii , vitis vinifera, and zea mays . the unrooted neighbor-joining tree was constructed using the mega  <dig>   <cit> . smkaos from s. miltiorrhiza are in bold. clades 1– <dig> indicate the three clades identified. b and c: fold changes of smkao <dig>  and smkao <dig>  genes in roots , stems , leaves  and flowers  of s. miltiorrhiza plants. the expression levels were analyzed using the quantitative rt-pcr method. expression level in leaves was arbitrarily set to  <dig> and the levels in other tissues were given relative to this. error bars represent standard deviations of mean value from three biological and four technical replicates. anova  was calculated using spss. p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant. d–i: responses of smkaos to exogenous ga <dig> treatment. fold changes of smkao <dig>  and smkao <dig>  transcripts in roots, stems and leaves of s. miltiorrhiza plantlets treated with 100 μm ga <dig> for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 48 h are shown. the expression levels were analyzed using the quantitative rt-pcr method. expression level in tissues without treatment  was arbitrarily set to  <dig> and the levels in tissues from ga3-treated plantlets were given relative to this. error bars represent standard deviations of mean value from three biological and four technical replicates. anova  was calculated using spss. p <  <dig>   and p <  <dig>   was considered statistically significant and extremely significant, respectively



characterization and expression analysis of the smga20ox gene family
ga20ox represents an important regulatory node in ga metabolism and plays significant roles in maintaining the endogenous ga level in plants  <cit> . it catalyzes the conversion of ga <dig> and ga <dig>  to ga <dig> and ga <dig> , respectively. the reaction requires successive oxidation of c- <dig> from the methyl group of c20-gas through the alcohol and then aldehyde, from which the c- <dig> is lost as carbon dioxide  <cit> . usually, a single enzyme with full ga20ox catalytic activity can catalyze this reaction sequence  <cit> . however, few ga20ox enzymes catalyze only partial of the reaction sequence. for instance, there are a total of five arabidopsis atga20ox enzymes, of which, four, including atga20ox1–atga20ox <dig>  possess full ga20ox activity in vitro, while the other one, named atga20ox <dig>  can only catalyze the first two steps of the reaction sequence  <cit> .

from s. miltiorrhiza, a total of six smga20ox genes were identified. all of them contain the diox_n and 2og-feii_oxy domains found in 2-oxoglutarate/fe-dependent dioxygenases . sequence comparison showed that the six smga20ox proteins could be roughly divided into two groups. smga20ox <dig>  smga20ox <dig>  smga20ox <dig> and smga20ox <dig> share over 60 % sequence identity in a group, while smga20ox <dig> and smga20ox <dig> share about 50 % identity in the other group. phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> ga20ox proteins from arabidopsis, rice, and other eight plant species showed that plant ga20ox proteins could be divided into four clades . smga20ox <dig>  smga20ox <dig>  smga20ox <dig> and smga20ox <dig> group with atga20ox1–atga20ox <dig> and other seven ga20ox proteins from various plant species in clade  <dig>  smga20ox <dig> and smga20ox <dig> cluster with atga20ox <dig>  osga20ox <dig> and osga20ox <dig> in clade  <dig>  clade  <dig> and clade  <dig> mainly include ga20ox proteins from rice. no smga20ox and atga20ox proteins belong to the two clades. it indicates the conservation and divergence of ga20ox proteins in plants.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of ga20ox proteins and expression profiling of smga20ox genes. a: phylogentic relationship of ga20ox proteins in arabidopsis thaliana , lactuca sativa , lolium perenne , nicotiana tabacum , oryza sativa , phaseolus vulgaris , pisum sativum , salvia miltiorrhiza , solanum dulcamara , solanum lycopersicum , and spinacia oleracea . the unrooted neighbor-joining tree was constructed using the mega  <dig>   <cit> . smga20ox proteins from s. miltiorrhiza are in bold. clades 1– <dig> indicate the four clades identified. b–g: fold changes of smga20ox <dig> , smga20ox <dig> , smga20ox <dig> , smga20ox <dig> , smga20ox <dig>  and smga20ox <dig>  in roots , stems , leaves  and flowers  of s. miltiorrhiza plants. the expression levels were analyzed using the quantitative rt-pcr method. expression level in leaves was arbitrarily set to  <dig> and the levels in other tissues were given relative to this. error bars represent standard deviations of mean value from three biological and four technical replicates. anova  was calculated using spss. p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant



since the majority of ga20ox proteins showed full catalytic activity in converting c <dig> substrates to c <dig> products, the expression patterns, rather than enzymatic activities, determine their physiological roles in plants  <cit> . using the qrt-pcr method, we analyzed the expression patterns of  <dig> smga20ox genes in roots, stems, leaves and flowers of s. miltiorrhiza plants. obvious differential expression of smga20ox genes was observed. smga20ox <dig> were predominantly expressed in roots, followed by leaves, and the lowest in stems and flowers . smga20ox <dig> showed high expression in roots, leaves and flowers, while its expression in stems was significantly low . smga20ox <dig> exhibited the highest expression in leaves, less in stems, flowers and roots . smga20ox <dig> showed high expression in leaves and stems, less in roots and flowers . smga20ox <dig> exhibited the highest expression in stems, followed by roots and leaves, and the lowest in flowers . smga20ox <dig> had the highest expression in roots, followed by leaves and flowers, and the lowest in stems . differential expression of ga20ox genes was also observed in other plant species, such as arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and maize  <cit> , indicating that different members of the ga20ox gene family might play distinct physiological roles. since the transcripts of multiple smga20ox genes exist in a tissue, it is possible that some of them act redundantly in plant growth and development.

consistently, among the six smga20ox genes, smga20ox <dig> was significantly down-regulated in roots, stems and leaves treated with ga <dig> for  <dig>   <dig> and 48 h . down-regulated expression was also found for smga20ox <dig> in roots at the time-point of 12-h-treatment, in stems at the time-points of 12- and 24-h-treatment, and leaves at all three time-points . similarly, smga20ox <dig> was down-regulated in roots and stems at the time-point of 24-h-treatment . smga20ox <dig> was down-regulated in roots at the time-points of 24- and 48-h-treatment . smga20ox <dig> was down-regulated in roots at the time-point of 12- and 48-h-treatment, and in stems and leaves at the time-point of 12-h-treatment . it suggests the existence of negative feedback mechanism to regulate the expression of some smga20ox genes in s. miltiorrhiza. no significant changes were observed for the expression of smga20ox <dig> in roots, stems and leaves , smga20ox <dig> and smga20ox <dig> in leaves , and smga20ox <dig> , smga20ox <dig> , smga20ox <dig> , smga20ox <dig>  in roots and leaves at one or two time-points of ga <dig> treatment, suggesting that the responses of smga <dig> genes to ga <dig> treatment depend on tissue types and time-points of ga <dig> treatment in s. miltiorrhiza.fig.  <dig> responses of smga20ox genes to exogenous ga <dig> treatment. fold changes of smga20ox <dig> , smga20ox <dig> , smga20ox <dig> , smga20ox <dig> , smga20ox <dig>  and smga20ox <dig>  in roots, stems and leaves of s. miltiorrhiza plantlets treated with 100 μm ga <dig> for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 48 h are shown. the expression levels were analyzed using the quantitative rt-pcr method. expression level in tissues without treatment  was arbitrarily set to  <dig> and the levels in tissues from ga3-treated plantlets were given relative to this. error bars represent standard deviations of mean value from three biological and four technical replicates. anova  was calculated using spss. p <  <dig>   and p <  <dig>   was considered statistically significant and extremely significant, respectively



characterization and expression analysis of smga3ox <dig> and smga3ox2
ga3ox plays a direct role in conversion of precursor gas to their biologically active forms and determines the level of bioactive gas in plants  <cit> . it catalyzes the formation of final bioactive ga <dig> and ga <dig> from ga <dig> and ga <dig>  respectively, in a single step in plants. it also catalyzes the production of small amounts of ga <dig>  a c- <dig> -unsaturated bioactive ga, in a two-step reaction via ga <dig> in several monocotyledons  <cit> . from the s. miltiorrhiza genome, we identified and cloned two smga3ox genes, named smga3ox <dig> and smga3ox <dig>  respectively . smga3ox <dig> contains 1038 bp of orf encoding a protein with  <dig> amino acids, while smga3ox <dig> contains 1092 bp of orf encoding a protein with  <dig> amino acids.

phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> ga3ox proteins from  <dig> plant species showed that plant ga3ox could be divided into  <dig> clades . smga3ox <dig> and smga3ox <dig> were separated into two clades , suggesting the divergence of smga3ox <dig> and smga3ox <dig>  consistently, differential expression was observed between smga3ox <dig> and smga3ox <dig> . smga3ox <dig> expressed broadly in the tissues analyzed, while smga3ox <dig> exhibited more tissue-specific expression with the highest level in stems and roots, followed by leaves, and the lowest in flowers. differential expression was also observed for arabidopsis and rice ga3ox genes  <cit> . of the two rice osga3ox genes, osga3ox <dig> was preferentially expressed in the panicles, while osga3ox <dig> was broadly expressed in all organs tested  <cit> . among the four atga3ox genes, atga3ox <dig> was expressed throughout development; atga3ox <dig> was mainly expressed during seed germination and vegetative growth; while atga3ox <dig> and atga3ox <dig> were predominantly expressed in reproductive organs  <cit> . thus, smga3ox <dig> appears to be important for the development of both vegetative and reproductive organs, while smga3ox <dig> is more specific to bioactive ga biosynthesis during vegetative growth of s. miltiorrhiza. analysis of smga3oxs to exogenous ga <dig> showed that smga3ox <dig> was down-regulated in roots, stems and leaves treated with ga <dig> for  <dig>   <dig> and 48 h . smga3ox <dig> was down-regulated in stems and leaves of s. miltiorrhiza treated with ga <dig> for  <dig> and 48 h . no changes were found for smga3ox <dig> in roots at all three time-points and in stems and leaves at the time-point of 24-h-treatment . it suggests that each member of the ga3ox gene family from a plant species may play different physiological roles.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of ga3ox proteins and expression profiling of smga3ox genes. a: phylogentic relationship of ga3ox proteins in arabidopsis thaliana , cucumis sativus , cucurbita maxima , gossypium hirsutum , malus domestica , oryza sativa , physcomitrella patens , pisum sativum , rorippa aquatica , salvia miltiorrhiza , spinacia oleracea , theobroma cacao , and zea mays . the unrooted neighbor-joining tree was constructed using the mega  <dig>   <cit> . smga3ox <dig> and smga3ox <dig> from s. miltiorrhiza are in bold. clades 1– <dig> indicate the three clades identified. b and c: fold changes of smga3ox <dig>  and smga3ox <dig>  in roots , stems , leaves  and flowers  of s. miltiorrhiza plants. the expression levels were analyzed using the quantitative rt-pcr method. expression level in leaves was arbitrarily set to  <dig> and the levels in other tissues were given relative to this. error bars represent standard deviations of mean value from three biological and four technical replicates. anova  was calculated using spss. p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant. d–i: responses of smga3ox genes to exogenous ga <dig> treatment. fold changes of smga3ox <dig>  and smga3ox <dig>  transcripts in roots, stems and leaves of s. miltiorrhiza plantlets treated with 100 μm ga <dig> for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 48 h are shown. the expression levels were analyzed using the quantitative rt-pcr method. expression level in tissues without treatment  was arbitrarily set to  <dig> and the levels in tissues from ga3-treated plantlets were given relative to this. error bars represent standard deviations of mean value from three biological and four technical replicates. anova  was calculated using spss. p <  <dig>   and p <  <dig>   was considered statistically significant and extremely significant, respectively



characterization and expression analysis of the smga2ox gene family
contrary to ga3ox involved in bioactive ga formation, ga2ox catalyzes the deactivation of bioactive gas, such as ga <dig> and ga <dig>  by introducing a 2β-hydroxy group to the gas  <cit> . in addition to the bioactive c19-gas, ga2ox can also use c19-  and c20-ga precursors  of bioactive gas as substrates. therefore, ga2ox is important for turnover of the physiologically active gas, allowing precise regulation of ga concentration in plant tissues  <cit> . ga2ox is usually encoded by a small gene family in plants. based on the substrates, ga2ox proteins can be divided into two groups, one group, known as c19-ga2ox proteins, using bioactive c19-gas and c19-ga precursors as substrates, while the other group, known as c20-ga2ox, acting on c20-ga precursors  <cit> .

from the current assembly of the s. miltiorrhiza genome, we predicted  <dig> smga2ox genes . the prediction was verified by pcr amplification and subsequent sequencing. all of the deduced smga2ox proteins contain the conserved domains, diox_n and 2og-feii_oxy . it is consistent with their 2-oxoglutarate/fe-dependent dioxygenase activity. moreover, smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig> and smga2ox <dig> contain the three unique and conserved motifs  identified in atga2ox <dig>  atga2ox <dig>  osga2ox <dig>  osga2ox <dig>  osga2ox <dig> and soga2ox <dig>  which use c20-ga precursors as substrates  <cit> . it indicates that smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig> and smga2ox <dig> are c20-ga2ox proteins. interestingly, smga2ox <dig> also contain the three motifs; however, the sequences of these motifs are less conserved compared with those in smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig> and smga2ox <dig> . further analysis of the motifs in atga2ox and osga2ox proteins showed that osga2ox <dig> also contained the three less conserved motifs . it implies that smga2ox <dig> and osga2ox <dig> may be c20-ga2ox proteins with specific functions. the three motifs are absent from other seven smga2ox proteins, such as smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox7–smga2ox <dig>  indicating they are c19-ga2ox proteins.fig.  <dig> sequence alignment of the three unique and conserved motifs identified in various ga2ox proteins. a. thaliana , o. sativa , spinacia oleracea  and s. miltiorrhiza 



phylogenetic relationship among  <dig> ga2ox proteins from  <dig> plant species was analyzed. based on the phylogenetic tree constructed, plant ga2ox proteins could be divided into four clades . smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  atga2ox1–atga2ox <dig> and other ten plant ga2ox proteins group in clade  <dig>  five rice osga2ox proteins, including osga2ox <dig>  osga2ox <dig>  osga2ox <dig>  osga2ox <dig> and osga2ox <dig>  cluster in clade  <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  atga2ox <dig>  atga2ox <dig>  osga2ox <dig>  osga2ox <dig>  soga2ox <dig> and psga2oxl group in clade  <dig>  the other eleven, including smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig> and osga2ox <dig> and the known c20-ga2ox proteins , cluster in clade  <dig>  it is similar with previous results from plant ga2ox analysis  <cit> , suggesting members of clades  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are c19-ga2ox proteins, while members of clade  <dig> are c20-ga2ox proteins.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of ga2ox proteins in s. miltiorrhiza and various other plant species. it includes arabidopsis thaliana , cucurbita maxima , nicotiana attenuata , nicotiana tabacum , oryza sativa , phaseolus coccineus , pisum sativum , salvia miltiorrhiza , solanum lycopersicum , and spinacia oleracea . the unrooted neighbor-joining tree was constructed using the mega  <dig>   <cit> . smga2ox proteins from s. miltiorrhiza are in bold. clades 1– <dig> indicate the four clades identified



to investigate the expression pattern of each smga2ox gene, we analyzed their transcript levels in roots, stems, leaves and flowers of s. miltiorrhiza using the qrt-pcr method. similarly with the results from smga20ox and smga3ox genes, smga2ox genes showed obvious differential expression . smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig> and smga2ox <dig> were mainly expressed in roots . smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig> and smga2ox <dig> showed the highest expression in leaves, followed by roots, flowers and stems . smga2ox <dig> and smga2ox <dig> were predominantly expressed in flowers . smga2ox <dig> showed the highest expression in leaves and flowers, followed by roots and stems . smga2ox <dig> exhibited the highest expression in stems, followed by flowers, leaves and roots . smga2ox <dig> was predominantly expressed in flowers and stems . distinct expression patterns were also observed for members of the ga2ox gene family in arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . these results suggest the redundant and diversified physiological roles of ga2ox genes played in plants.fig.  <dig> expression patterns of smga2ox genes in s. miltiorrhiza plants. a–k: fold changes of smga2ox <dig> , smga2ox <dig> , smga2ox <dig> , smga2ox <dig> , smga2ox <dig> , smga2ox <dig> , smga2ox <dig> , smga2ox <dig> , smga2ox <dig> , smga2ox <dig>  and smga2ox <dig>  genes in roots , stems , leaves  and flowers  of s. miltiorrhiza plants. the expression levels were analyzed using the quantitative rt-pcr method. expression level in leaves was arbitrarily set to  <dig> and the levels in other tissues were given relative to this. error bars represent standard deviations of mean value from three biological and four technical replicates. anova  was calculated using spss. p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant



among the eleven smga2ox genes, five, including smga2ox <dig> and smga2ox4–smga2ox <dig>  were significantly up-regulated in roots, stems and leaves treated with ga <dig> for  <dig>   <dig> and 48 h . up-regulation of ga2ox genes has been previously found for atga2ox <dig> and atga2ox <dig> in arabidopsis treated with exogenous ga <dig>  <cit>  and is considered as a result of feedback control  <cit> . additionally, smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig> and smga2ox <dig> were significantly down-regulated in all or the majority of the ga3-treated tissues analyzed . smga2ox <dig> was significantly down-regulated in roots and stems at the time-point of 48 h and significantly up-regulated in roots at the time-point of 12-h-treatment, in stems at the time-points of 12- and 24-h-treatment, and in leaves at the time-points of 24- and 48-h-treatment . the expression of smga2ox <dig> was too low to be detected in roots, stems and leaves  and in the tissues of s. miltiorrhiza treated with ga <dig>  these results suggest that individual members of the smga2ox gene family exhibit differential responses to ga <dig> treatment and the responses depend on tissue types.fig.  <dig> responses of smga2ox genes to exogenous ga <dig> treatment. a–ad: fold changes of smga2ox <dig> , smga2ox <dig> , smga2ox <dig> , smga20ox <dig> , smga20ox <dig> , smga20ox <dig> , smga2ox <dig> , smga2ox <dig> , smga2ox <dig>  and smga2ox <dig>  in roots, stems and leaves of s. miltiorrhiza plantlets treated with 100 μm ga <dig> for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 48 h. the expression levels were analyzed using the quantitative rt-pcr method. expression level in tissues without treatment  was arbitrarily set to  <dig> and the levels in tissues from ga3-treated plantlets were given relative to this. error bars represent standard deviations of mean value from three biological and four technical replicates. anova  was calculated using spss. p <  <dig>   and p <  <dig>   was considered statistically significant and extremely significant, respectively



responses of smcpss and smksls to exogenous ga3
cps and ks are two enzymes catalyze the formation of ent-kaurene from ggpp in two steps via ent-copalyl diphosphate  in the first stage of ga biosynthesis. in our previous studies, five smcps genes in s. miltiorrhiza were identified  <cit> . although the function of smcps genes has not been fully elucidated, smcps <dig>  which was predominantly expressed in root cortices, is involved in tanshinone biosynthesis  <cit> . smcps <dig> were significantly up-regulated in roots, stems and leaves of s. miltiorrhiza plants treated with ga <dig> . it suggests that tanshinone biosynthesis-related genes may be responsive to exogenous ga <dig> treatment. similarly, smcps <dig> and smcps <dig> were significantly up-regulated in ga3-treated plants . the expression levels of smcps <dig> and smcps <dig> were too low to be detected in the tissues analyzed.fig.  <dig> responses of smcps and smksl genes to exogenous ga <dig> treatment. fold changes of smcps <dig> , smcps <dig> , smcps <dig> , smksl <dig>  and smksl <dig>  in roots, stems and leaves of s. miltiorrhiza plantlets treated with 100 μm ga <dig> for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 48 h are shown. the expression levels were analyzed using the quantitative rt-pcr method. expression level in tissues without treatment  was arbitrarily set to  <dig> and the levels in tissues from ga3-treated plantlets were given relative to this. error bars represent standard deviations of mean value from three biological and four technical replicates. anova  was calculated using spss. p <  <dig>   and p <  <dig>   was considered statistically significant and extremely significant, respectively



so far, two smksls, known as smksl <dig> and smksl <dig>  have been identified from s. miltiorrhiza  <cit> . smksl <dig> showed the highest expression level in stems, followed by leaves, roots and flowers, while the expression levels of smksl <dig> were similar in all tissues  <cit> . previous studies have shown that smksl <dig> is involved in tanshinone biosynthesis  <cit> . analyzing the responses of smksl <dig> and smksl <dig> to ga <dig> treatment showed that both smksl <dig> and smksl <dig> were significantly up-regulated in roots, stems and leaves of s. miltiorrhiza plants treated with exogenous ga <dig> , confirming that tanshinone biosynthesis-related genes may be responsive to exogenous ga <dig> treatment.

responses of ga metabolism pathway genes to yeast extract and ag+ treatment
in addition to exogenous bioactive gas, ga metabolism pathway genes may also response to environmental cues, such as light, temperature and various stresses  <cit> . yeast extract and ag+ are effective elicitors for the production of terpenoids. many genes involved in the upstream of ga biosynthesis pathway were significantly up-regulated in s. miltiorrhiza after yeast extract and ag+ treatment  <cit> . however, it was unknown whether the ga metabolism pathway genes were responsive to yeast extract and ag+ treatment. in this study, transcriptome-wide analysis of ga metabolism pathway genes was carried out using rna-seq data of s. miltiorrhiza hairy roots treated with or without yeast extract  and ag+   <cit> . rna-seq reads from s. miltiorrhiza hairy roots non-treated  and treated for  <dig> ,  <dig>  and 36 h  were mapped to the cloned orfs of  <dig> ga metabolism pathway genes using soap <dig>  <cit> . a total of nine genes had the rpkm value > <dig>  and was considered to be expressed in s. miltiorrhiza hairy roots. it includes smko, smkao <dig>  smkao <dig>  smga3ox <dig>  smga20ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig> and smga2ox <dig>  of which smga2ox <dig> was significantly down-regulated at the time-point of  <dig> hpi, smko and smga20ox <dig> were significantly down-regulated at the time-points of  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, smkao <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig> and smga2ox <dig> were significantly down-regulated at all time-points of treatment, while smga3ox <dig> was up-regulated at all time-points of treatment . smkao <dig> was down-regulated at the time-points of  <dig> and  <dig> hpi and up-regulated at the time-point of  <dig> hpi . it suggests that the majority of ga metabolism pathway genes are yeast extract and ag+-responsive.fig.  <dig> responses of ga metabolism pathway genes to yeast extract and ag+ treatment. s. miltiorrhiza hairy roots were treated for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 36 h, respectively. rna-seq reads were mapped to the cloned orfs of ga metabolism pathway genes. genes with rpkm value greater than  <dig> were analyzed for differential expression using fisher’s exact test. p <  <dig>  was considered as differentially expressed. *indicates significant differential expression compared with the level in hairy roots without treatment



alternative splicing  of ga metabolism pathway genes
alternative splicing  is a post-transcriptional mechanism of precursor-mrna   <cit> . through as, multiple distinct mrna isoforms are produced from a single gene locus. the process of as plays significant roles in the diversity of transcriptome and proteome and the abundance of transcripts and proteins and is involved in many aspects of plant growth and development, such as photosynthesis, flowering, cereal grain quality, circadian clock, and response to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . in a previous study, two differently spliced atko  mrnas had been cloned, sequenced and detected using northern hybridization  <cit> . in order to examine whether genes associated with ga metabolism underwent as events, we analyzed the assembled s. miltiorrhiza transcriptome  <cit>  for the  <dig> cloned ga metabolism pathway genes. sequence comparison among unigenes, the cloned cdnas and the genomic dna showed that smko, smga20ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig> and smga2ox <dig> produced splice variants . the number of unigenes corresponding to splice variants is two for smko, one for smga20ox <dig>  one for smga2ox <dig>  and three for smga2ox <dig>  respectively .fig.  <dig> alternative splicing and tissue-specific expression of various ga metabolism pathway genes in s. miltiorrhiza. a–d: gene structures of smko , smga20ox <dig> , smga2ox <dig> , smga2ox <dig>  and their splice variants. filled boxes represent exons. lines represent introns. e–h: fold changes of smkov <dig> , smga20ox3v , smga2ox3v  and smga2ox11v <dig>  in roots , stems , leaves  and flowers  of s. miltiorrhiza plants. the expression levels were analyzed using the quantitative rt-pcr method. expression level in leaves was arbitrarily set to  <dig> and the levels in other tissues were given relative to this. error bars represent standard deviations of mean value from three biological and four technical replicates. anova  was calculated using spss. p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant



qrt-pcr analysis using splice variant-specific primers showed that specific amplicons could be obtained for smkov <dig>  smga20ox3v, smga2ox3v and smga2ox11v <dig> . smkov <dig> exhibited the highest expression in leaves, followed by stems and flowers, and the lowest in roots . smga20ox3v showed higher expression in roots, leaves and flowers than stems . smga2ox3v was predominantly expressed in flowers . smga2ox11v <dig> showed the highest expression in flowers, followed by stems, and the lowest in roots and leaves . the expression patterns of splice variants in roots, stems, leaves and flowers were similar to normal transcripts , although the overall expression levels of splice variants were significantly lower. smkov <dig>  smga20ox3v and smga2ox11v <dig> showed differential response to exogenous ga <dig> treatment in roots, stems and leaves of s. miltiorrhiza . smkov <dig> was significantly up-regulated at the time-point of 12-h-treatment, while down-regulated at the time-points of 24- and 48-h-treatment in s. miltiorrhiza roots . it was significantly down-regulated in stems at the time-points of 12- and 48-h-treatment and in roots at all three time-points of ga <dig> treatment . the responses of smkov <dig> to ga <dig> treatment were different from smko . smga20ox3v showed significant down-regulation in roots at the time-points of 24- and 48-h-treatment and in stems at the time-points of 12- and 24-h-treatment, while no significant change was observed in roots at the time-point of 12-h-treatment, in stems at the time-point of 48-h-treatment, and in leaves at all three time-points of ga <dig> treatment . smga2ox11v <dig> exhibited significant down-regulated in roots and leaves at all three time-points and in stems at the time-points of 12- and 24-h-treatment . the responsive patterns of smga20ox3v and smga2ox11v <dig> were similar to smga20ox <dig>  and smga2ox <dig> , respectively. taken together, these results suggest the importance of as in regulating ga metabolism in s. miltiorrhiza.fig.  <dig> responses of splice variants to exogenous ga <dig> treatment. a–i: fold changes of smkov <dig> , smga20ox3v  and smga2ox11v <dig>  in roots, stems and leaves of s. miltiorrhiza plantlets treated with 100 μm ga <dig> for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 48 h. the expression levels were analyzed using the quantitative rt-pcr method. expression level in tissues without treatment  was arbitrarily set to  <dig> and the levels in tissues from ga3-treated plantlets were given relative to this. error bars represent standard deviations of mean value from three biological and four technical replicates. anova  was calculated using spss. p <  <dig>   and p <  <dig>   was considered statistically significant and extremely significant, respectively



discussion
characterization of the ga metabolism pathway genes in s. miltiorrhiza
s. miltiorrhiza bunge is one of the most important traditional chinese medicine  materials. it is also an emerging model medicinal plant. identification of ga metabolism pathway genes in s. miltiorrhiza may help to elucidate the biological function of these genes, the regulatory mechanism of ga metabolism, and the interplay between the ga metabolism pathway and other terpenoid metabolism pathways. genome-wide prediction, molecular cloning and expression analysis of the  <dig> ga metabolism pathway genes encoding smko, smkao, smga20ox, smga3ox and smga2ox proteins in s. miltiorrhiza provide a foundation for further demonstrating the ga metabolism pathway and for commercial application. however, due to the incompleteness of the s. miltiorrhiza whole genome assembly, it could be not a complete set of ga metabolism pathway genes.

ko and kao are two multifunctional cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases catalyzing the conversion of ent-kaurene to ga <dig> in the second stage of ga metabolism pathway  <cit> . they are encoded by one or two genes in a plant species. the arabidopsis genome contains an atko and two atkaos, while the rice genome has two oskos and an oskao. similarly, from s. miltiorrhiza, we identified a smko and two smkaos. it is consistent with previous conclusion that enzymes involved in the early steps of the ga metabolism pathway are usually encoded by single or few genes  <cit> . analysis of phylogenetic relationship showed that ko and kao proteins found in a plant species, such as rice osko <dig> and osko <dig>  coffea arabica cako <dig> and cako <dig>  lactuca sativa lsko <dig> and lsko <dig>  arabidopsis atkao <dig> and atkao <dig>  pisum sativum pskao <dig> and pskao <dig> and s. miltiorrhiza smkao <dig> and smkao <dig>  clustered together in the unrooted neighbor-joining trees . it indicates that kos and kaos from a plant species are usually paralogous originating from gene duplication.

using chlorop, atko had been predicted to contain a plastid transit peptide  <cit> . transient expression studies of atko-green fluorescent protein  fusion in tobacco leaves showed that atko-gfp was targeted to the chloroplast  <cit> . in vitro protein import assays with isolated pea chloroplasts showed that atko was located on the outer surface of the chloroplast envelope  <cit> . however, it has been suggested that the subcellular localization of atko requires further confirmation, since the strong fluorescence from the chlorophylls may result in false positive results  <cit> . in this study, subcellular localization analysis of the deduced smko, smkao <dig> and smkao <dig> proteins using targetp  <dig>   <cit>  showed that each of them contained a secretory pathway signal peptide at the n-terminus . it indicates that these proteins are most possibly located in the endoplasmic reticulum of s. miltiorrhiza cells. the secretory pathway signal peptides were also found at the n-terminal of kos and kaos from arabidopsis and rice . it implies that the conversion of ent-kaurene to ga <dig> is also located in the endoplasmic reticulum in arabidopsis and rice. the results are consistent with those from arabidopsis atkao <dig> and atkao <dig> analyses  <cit>  and from early biochemistry studies showing that the conversion of ent-kaurenol, ent-7α-hydroxyk aurenoic acid and ga <dig> are located in the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> .

bioactive gibberellins are converted from ga <dig> through the non-13-hydroxylation pathway and the early 13-hydroxylation pathway under the catalysis of ga20ox and ga3ox  <cit> . recently, rice cyp <dig> members, cyp714b <dig> and cyp714b <dig>  were reported to encode ga 13-oxidase  catalyzing the conversion of ga <dig> to ga <dig>  which is the first step of the early ga 13-hydroxylation pathway  <cit> . in arabidopsis, a member of the cyp <dig> member, termed cyp714a <dig>  was found to convert ga <dig> to 12α-hydroxyl ga <dig>  as a major product and 13-hydroxy ga <dig>  as a minor product, while the other member, termed cyp714a <dig>  catalyzed the conversion of ga <dig> to 16-carboxylated ga <dig>  <cit> . from s. miltiorrhiza, a total of nineteen 2-odds were identified. it includes six smga20oxs and two smga3oxs catalyzing the biosynthesis of bioactive gas and eleven smga2oxs involved in the deactivation of bioactive gas. however, no genomic dna sequence was retrieved when blast analysis of arabidopsis cyp714a <dig> and cyp714a <dig> and rice cyp714b <dig> and cyp714b <dig> against the current assembly of the s. miltiorrhiza genome was carried out using the tblastn algorithm  <cit> . it could be due to the incompleteness of the s. miltiorrhiza whole genome assembly or low sequence homology among ga13ox proteins from s. miltiorrhiza, arabidopsis and rice.

among the nineteen s. miltiorrhiza 2-odds, sixteen were predicted to be located in the cytoplasm. similarly,  <dig> of the  <dig> arabidopsis 2-odds and  <dig> of the  <dig> rice 2-odds were predicted to be located in the cytoplasm. it suggests that the final stage of ga metabolism is conservatively occurred in the cytoplasm. unexpectedly, various 2-odds from s. miltiorrhiza, arabidopsis and rice, such as smga20ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  atga20ox <dig>  atga2ox <dig>  osga2ox <dig>  osga3ox <dig> and osga2ox <dig>  contain chloroplast transit peptides at the n-terminal. although the function of these plastid-located 2-odds is not clear, some of them may play limited and specific roles in plants. for instance, atga20ox <dig> catalyzes only the first two steps of the successive oxidation reaction sequence  <cit> . no significant phenotype changes were observed when atga20ox <dig> was disrupted in arabidopsis plants  <cit> . thus, cytoplasm- and plastid-located 2-odds probably play distinct physiological roles, which need to be investigated further.

multiple layer regulation of ga metabolism in s. miltiorrhiza
as one of the five classical phytohormones, ga plays significant roles in many aspects of plant growth and development. precise regulation of ga content appears to be critical in plant normal development and response to various environmental cues, such as light, temperature and other stresses  <cit> . multiple layer regulation may greatly help keeping ga content at the appropriate level and satisfying the needs of cells and organs at different developmental stages and under different environmental conditions. in this study, we showed that ga metabolism in s. miltiorrhiza was controlled by multiple mechanisms, such as alternative splicing, tissue-/organ-specific metabolism pathway, positive and negative feedback regulation, and yeast extract and ag+-responsive gene expression.

alternative splicing represents an important post-transcriptional mechanism in regulation of gene expression during plant growth and development  <cit> . transcriptome-wide analysis of splice variants showed the occurrence of as in more than 40 % of the nine candidate ga metabolism pathway genes with assembled unigenes in s. miltiorrhiza. splice variants showed tissue-specific expression patterns and were responsive to exogenous ga <dig> treatement. these results suggest the importance of as in regulating ga metabolism in s. miltiorrhiza.

gene expression profiling revealed that the identified ga metabolism pathway genes exhibit tissue-/organ-specific expression patterns. additionally, exogenous ga <dig> treatment showed that individuals of ga metabolism pathway genes responded differentially and the responses depended on tissue types and organs. differential expression of ga metabolism pathway genes suggests that each member of a gene family may play different physiological roles. tissue-/organ-specific expression patterns and response to ga <dig> treatment provide evidence for the hypothesis that an additional layer of regulation may reside in the separation of the ga metabolism pathway into distinct cell types in tissues and organs requiring ga for development  <cit> . the results indicate the existence of tissue-/organ-specific metabolism pathway involving different enzyme isoforms.

it has been shown that the expression of some ga oxidase genes is under feedback control by bioactive gas . it includes down-regulation of some ga20ox and ga3ox genes  and up-regulation of some ga2ox genes . for instance, ga <dig> treatment of arabidopsis ga1- <dig> plants substantially reduced the abundance of atga20ox1–atga20ox <dig> transcripts in floral shoots  <cit> . consistently, arabidopsis atga20ox <dig>  and atga3ox <dig>  transcription was repressed in wild-type plants treated with exogenous ga <dig>  <cit>  compared with wild-type plants, expression levels of three potato stga20ox genes, named stga20ox1–stga20ox <dig>  were very much increased in the ga <dig> dwarf mutant of potato, while treatment of potato ga <dig> plants with ga <dig> strongly reduced transcript abundance of all three stga20ox genes  <cit> . in contrast to atga20ox and atga3ox genes, expression levels of arabidopsis atga2ox <dig> and atga2ox <dig> were increased by application of ga <dig>  <cit> . bioactive ga content reduction caused by ga20ox and ga3ox gene down-regulation and ga inactivation resulting from ga2ox gene up-regulation appear to be important for maintaining active ga concentrations within certain limits  <cit> . on the other hand, it has been shown that feedback regulation of ga levels does not occur in all organs  <cit>  and the expression of some ga metabolism pathway genes, such as arabidopsis atko <dig>  <cit>  and atga3ox <dig>  <cit> , wheat tacps, taks, tako and takao  <cit> , are not subject to feedback regulation by gas. down-regulation of smga20ox and smga3ox genes and up-regulation of smga2ox genes suggest the existence of feedback regulation mechanism of ga metabolism in s. miltiorrhiza. the underlying mechanism for up-regulation of smko, smkao <dig> and smkao <dig>  and down-regulation of various smga2ox genes  in tissues treated with exogenous ga <dig> remain to be elucidated.

the responses of ga metabolism to environmental cues have been previously analyzed for light and temperature  <cit> . in this study, we found that nine ga metabolism pathway genes were expressed in hairy roots of s. miltiorrhiza. among them, seven, including smko, smkao <dig>  smga20ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig> and smga2ox <dig>  were significantly down-regulated at different time-points of yeast extract and ag+-treatment. smga2ox <dig> was significantly up-regulated at all time-points of treatment, while smkao <dig> was down-regulated at the time-points of  <dig> and  <dig> hpi and up-regulated at the time-point of  <dig> hpi. the identification of yeast extract and ag+-responsive ga metabolism pathway genes provide additional evidence for the regulation of ga metabolism by stresses.

crosstalk between ga metabolism and tanshinone biosynthesis in s. miltiorrhiza
both gas and tanshinones are diterpenoids sharing ggpp as the common precursor  <cit> . previously, smcps <dig> and smksl <dig> were identified to be key enzyme genes involved in tanshinone biosynthesis in s. miltiorrhiza  <cit> . in this study, both smcps <dig> and smksl <dig> were significantly up-regulated in s. miltiorrhiza plants treated with ga <dig>  significant change of smcps <dig> and smksl <dig> gene expression levels in ga3-treated s. miltiorrhiza plants suggests tanshinone biosynthesis-related genes were responsive to exogenous ga <dig> treatment. it indicates the existence of crosstalk between ga metabolism and tanshinone biosynthesis. the expression changes of these genes could be important for redirecting ggpp into other branch of the diterpenoid biosynthesis pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
through systematical identification and characterization, including genome-wide identification, molecular cloning and expression analysis, we showed in this study for the first time a total of  <dig> candidate ga metabolism pathway genes. it represents five gene families, encoding a smko, two smkaos, six smga20oxs, two smga3oxs and eleven smga2oxs. gene feature and phylogenetic analysis showed the conservation and divergence of ga metabolism pathway genes in s. miltiorrhiza. many genes identified in this study were tissue-specifically expressed, feedback-regulated, stress-responsive and alternatively spliced. we found that nine of the twenty two ga metabolism pathway genes were responsive to yeast extract and ag+-treatment in s. miltiorrhiza hairy roots and tissue-specifically expressed splice variants existed for smko, smga20ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig> and smga2ox <dig>  among the splice variants identified, smkov <dig>  smga20ox3v and smga2ox11v <dig> were ga3-responsive. moreover, we showed that smcps <dig> and smksl <dig>  two tanshinone biosynthesis-related genes, were up-regulated in response to ga <dig> treatment. taken together, our results reveal multiple layer regulation of ga metabolism and crosstalk between ga metabolism and tanshinone biosynthesis in s. miltiorrhiza.
