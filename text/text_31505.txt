BACKGROUND
mutation of adenomatous polyposis coli  is an early event in colorectal carcinogenesis. the various subcellular localizations and binding partners of apc implicate this tumor suppressor in a wide variety of cellular functions in normal cells. the most well characterized function of apc is to inhibit wnt-β-catenin signaling by forming a multi-protein complex which targets cytoplasmic β-catenin for destruction  <cit> . a role for apc in the regulation of cytoskeletal integrity has also been proposed.

apc linkage with the actin network was demonstrated by both direct interaction of apc with actin and by actin-dependent membrane-localization of apc  <cit> . ectopic expression of apc, truncation of apc by mutation, and apc loss all result in aberrant cell migration  <cit> . identification of apc in a complex with iqgap, a scaffolding protein that binds to growing microtubules and regulates actin filament elongation, provides evidence that apc participates in cell migration  <cit> . depletion of either apc or iqgap <dig> inhibits actin polymerization and cell polarization  <cit> . apc also positively affects asef, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor specific for cdc <dig>  <cit> . a truncated apc protein similar to those associated with colon cancers was unable to activate asef  <cit> . apc interaction with the microtubule cytoskeleton has also been established. early localization studies identified apc at the plus ends of microtubules, implicating apc in cell migration  <cit> . the functional interaction of apc with the microtubule network is strengthened by the finding that apc directly interacts with tubulin and the microtubule-binding protein, eb <dig>  <cit> . depletion of apc destabilizes microtubules and inhibits spindle formation and cellular protrusions, thereby compromising cellular migration  <cit> .

actin-containing microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments , constitute the three main cytoskeletal elements that act coordinately to regulate cell structure, polarity and migration. ifs function as a scaffold to maintain cell and tissue integrity and defects in if impact a number of diseases . in the present study, we provide further evidence for the involvement of apc in the regulation of cytoskeletal structure through interaction with ifs. using purified polyclonal sera raised against the  <dig> amino acid repeat region of apc , we identified interactions between apc and if proteins lamin b <dig>  lamin b <dig>  keratin  <dig> and keratin  <dig>  we verified the lamin b <dig> interaction with apc by co-immunoprecipitation as well as by immunofluorescence microscopy in both cultured cells and human colonic tissue. nuclear lamins are type v ifs that form a spherical mesh lining the nuclear envelope, providing attachment sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores  <cit> . the keratin/apc interaction was further supported by protein co-localization in cultured cells. keratins are type i and ii ifs that are predominantly found in epithelial cells, providing structural integrity to those cells so that they can withstand mechanical stress  <cit> . identifying an interaction between apc and ifs expands the potential role of apc in cytoskeletal regulation. although apc expression and functions have been widely studied in basic research and clinical settings, recent reports have raised questions about the accuracy and reliability of many commercially available antibodies  <cit> . therefore, an apc antibody that accurately determines levels and subcellular localizations of apc in cells and especially in tissues is extremely important. our characterization of the apc-m <dig> pab validates its use in a variety of applications including detection of apc protein in mouse and human tissues.

RESULTS
intermediate filament protein lamin b <dig> co-precipitates with apc using the new apc-m <dig> pab
as a multi-functional tumor suppressor protein, apc has been widely analyzed regarding its subcellular localization and its interaction with other proteins. most commercial antibodies, which were raised against either the n- or c-terminus of apc, recognize proteins other than apc  <cit> . this cross reactivity makes it difficult to obtain reliable data using standard molecular and cellular biology techniques to study apc. thus, we injected rabbits with purified protein corresponding to the central domain of apc  and we affinity-purified sera from these rabbits . our initial analysis of apc-m <dig> pab in cultured cells utilized hct116βw colon epithelial cells that possess only the wild-type β-catenin allele and thus differ from the parental hct <dig> cells that contain one wild-type and one mutant β-catenin allele  <cit> . apc-m <dig> pab recognizes full-length apc which appears as a single band of ~ <dig> kda in lysates from hct116βw cells and truncated mutant apc  in lysates from sw <dig> cells . no band was detected in lysates from hca <dig> cells which are essentially null for apc  <cit> . both full-length and truncated apc were efficiently precipitated using apc-m <dig> pab . a well established binding partner of apc, β-catenin, was also co-precipitated with full-length apc from hct116βw cell lysates . thus, we confirmed the reliability of apc-m <dig> pab for use in immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation.

apc is a multi-functional protein involved in several different cellular pathways. many of apc's functions are only beginning to be elucidated. identifying novel binding partners for apc is a step toward fully understanding apc's involvement in the maintenance of cellular integrity. therefore, apc-m <dig> pab was used to co-immunoprecipitate apc and its associated proteins from hct116βw cell lysates. nine protein bands that were unique to the apc co-precipitation and not observed using preimmune sera as a control were visualized by colloidal blue staining . these bands and corresponding regions from the control lane were separately isolated, pooled and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry . forty-three potential apc binding proteins that precipitated with apc antisera and not with preimmune sera were identified as having cross-correlation scores  of ≧ <dig> for 2+ ion and ≧ <dig>  for 3+ ion . these  <dig> proteins could be grouped in eight broad categories, the largest two being cytoskeletal regulation and rna processing/translation. from the most abundant potential apc-binding proteins found, we chose to examine the interaction of apc with intermediate filaments in more detail. if proteins identified were lamin b <dig>  lamin b <dig>  keratin  <dig> and keratin  <dig> . initially, we focused on the most abundantly apc-associated protein of the four, lamin b <dig>  interaction of lamin b <dig> with apc was verified by co-immunoprecipitation .



lamin b <dig> and keratin colocalization with apc revealed using apc-m <dig> pab
to validate the interaction of lamin b <dig> with apc using colocalization, we first verified the utility of apc-m <dig> pab for immunofluorescence microscopy. apc-m <dig> pab recognizes apc at cell-cell junctions, in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of u2os cells . this pattern showed considerable overlap with that of one of the most frequently utilized commercially available apc antibodies, ali12- <dig>  which was raised against amino acid 135- <dig>  moreover, apc-m <dig> pab effectively detected a truncated apc protein expressed as a gfp-fusion in hct116βw cells . because the exogenous gfp-fused apc was greatly over-expressed, the exposure time for the apc-m <dig> pab signal was shortened to reveal the overlapping pattern. in contrast, apc-m <dig> pab did not recognize gfp fused to the sv <dig> nuclear localization signal .

to further validate the specificity of apc-m <dig> pab, u2os cells were transfected with a plasmid containing gfp and either a small hairpin rna  specific for apc or a negative control shrna. thus, cells expressing the shrna plasmids can be identified by the presence of gfp. cells expressing the negative control shrna plasmid displayed no alteration in apc signal intensity using apc-m2-pab for immunofluorescence microscopy . in contrast, cells expressing either of two apc-specific shrna plasmids displayed a marked reduction in both cytoplasmic and nuclear apc signal intensity . as another critical negative control, apc-m <dig> pab did not reveal immunofluorescence signal above background in hca <dig> cells which do not express apc . the slight fluorescent signal seen in hca <dig> cells stained using apc-m <dig> pab or in hct116βw cells stained using purified rabbit igg  was similar to that of control cells stained with only secondary antibody .

having validated apc-m <dig> pab for use in immunofluorescence applications, we probed hct116βw cells for endogenous apc and if proteins lamin b <dig> and keratin. in single confocal slices, apc appeared in puncta that partially overlapped lamin b <dig> and aligned with some keratin filaments . figure 4a shows apc and either keratin or laminb <dig> signals each captured in  <dig> z-plane images and projected into a single image. because the apc signal did not completely coincide with that of keratin or laminb <dig>  quantitation of the overlap was performed by determining the pearson's correlation coefficient from ~ <dig> individual confocal images representing > <dig> individual cells captured in three-dimensions . correlation coefficients of apc/lamin b <dig> and apc/keratin pairs were significantly higher than that of negative control samples stained with only the secondary antibodies . on average, 11% of the apc signal overlapped that of keratin and 27% overlapped that of lamin b <dig> . in figure 4c, images were analyzed for random overlap by shifting the green and red signals by  <dig> pixels in the x-direction. offset in either direction resulted in a decrease in the correlation, indicating that the overlap is not a chance occurrence from two relatively abundant signals . in addition, the cross-correlation coefficient for keratin or lamin b with a randomized apc signal was low and showed multiple peaks . results from the image analysis validated the observed co-localization of apc with both lamin b and keratin. as an alternative approach to further investigate this co-localization, full length apc was expressed as a gfp fusion. in single confocal slices, the gfp signal displayed partial overlap with both keratin and lamin b <dig> . taken together, the observed cellular co-localization is consistent with an association between apc and if proteins keratin and lamin b <dig> 

lamin b <dig> colocalization with apc in human colonic tissue revealed using apc-m <dig> pab
in normal human colon tissue, apc-m <dig> pab predominantly marked the cell junctions, with increasing cytoplasmic and nuclear expression in epithelial cells at the luminal surface . lamin b <dig> showed perinuclear expression in epithelial cells in the upper half of the crypts and also in mesenchymal cells located between crypts. both apc and lamin b <dig> exhibited increasing expression from the crypt base toward the luminal surface . a higher magnification of the confocal image reveals perinuclear colocalization of apc with lamin b <dig> at the luminal surface . a similar co-localization could be seen further down the crypt where the apc signal was not as saturated . unlike lamin b <dig> staining, apc staining appeared more intense in epithelial cells than in surrounding stromal cells. as a positive control, normal human colonic tissue was co-stained for β-catenin and apc . apc-m <dig> pab revealed apc in both nuclei and at cell junctions, with a staining pattern partially overlapping that of β-catenin. human colon tissue stained with rabbit preimmune sera and purified mouse igg revealed only minimal signal and provided a negative control .

apc association with intermediate filament proteins is not dependent on actin or tubulin
ifs interact with both actin-containing microfilaments and microtubules . because apc also associates with actin and microtubules, it is possible that the co-immunoprecipitation of if proteins with apc is due to precipitation of a large complex of cytoskeletal components. to determine whether the apc/if interaction was dependent on actin-containing microfilaments and microtubules, we performed a traditional solubilization and extraction of both tubulin- and actin-containing microfilament proteins from cells, leaving behind predominantly insoluble ifs and desmosomes  <cit> . after sequential extraction, the cytoskeletal proteins tubulin and actin were efficiently removed from cells as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy . apc, however, remained cell-associated, as did if proteins lamin b <dig> and keratin. colocalization of apc with keratins was apparent in extracted cells, with the apc appearing as puncta along the keratin filaments . that apc remains cell-associated following this extraction procedure suggests a stable interaction between apc and ifs, independent of actin-containing microfilaments and microtubules.

apc-m <dig> pab is a versatile antibody, specific for apc
we have demonstrated specificity of apc-m <dig> pab for apc protein by immunoblot , immunoprecipitation  and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy using both cultured cells and human tissue . many mouse models have been established to analyze apc functions in the context of a whole mammalian organism. to validate the use of apc-m <dig> pab in animal studies, frozen sections of mouse small intestinal tissue were probed with apc-m2-pab and then apc was visualized using confocal microscopy. the staining of apc was most intense in cells at the top of villi, with less apc in cells near the crypt base . apc appeared at cell-cell junctions and in the cytoplasm with occasional nuclear localization . in the villus, cytoplasmic puncta were also visible, particularly near the basal surface . of note, apc-m <dig> pab did not reveal the apical apc distribution in intestinal tissues which was previously attributed to cross reactivity with a non-apc protein  <cit> .

discussion
in the current study, we have generated purified polyclonal antiserum that is specific for apc. apc-m <dig> pab is versatile and can be used to detect apc in immunostaining, immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. using this antibody, we identified a novel interaction between apc and ifs. the apc and if protein interactions were confirmed by co-precipitation and colocalization using both endogenous and gfp-tagged exogenous apc in cultured epithelial cells. association of apc with ifs is not dependent on actin-containing microfilaments and microtubules.

apc mutations are found in over 80% of all colorectal cancers and have been assessed for screening and prognosis purposes in the clinical setting. for such research, access to an apc antibody that accurately depicts levels and subcellular localizations of apc in cells and especially in tissues is extremely important. according to wakeman et. al.  <cit> , many commercially available antibodies also recognize an unidentified protein that localizes to the apical region of polarized epithelial cells. most currently available commercial apc antibodies were raised against several hundred amino acids at either the n- or c-terminus of the apc protein. however, most of these antibodies have not been proven to be specific for apc  <cit> . furthermore, many of these antibodies are only useful for a single application. for example, anti-apc ab- <dig> is only effective when used for immunostaining. therefore, we generated a new antibody against the  <dig> amino acid repeat region in the middle of apc . the affinity-purified apc-m <dig> pab recognizes junctional, cytoplasmic and nuclear apc by immunostaining  without producing the non-specific apical staining pattern previously seen  <cit> . although there was a great deal of overlap, immunofluorescent signals from apc-m <dig> pab and anti-apc ali12- <dig> were not 100% coincident. the ali12- <dig> antibody was raised against a different portion of apc protein than m2-apc. the most likely explanation for the slight signal disparity is that the epitopes recognized by apc-m <dig> pab are masked by apc folding, or the binding of another protein to a subset of the apc protein. in a similar manner, it would be expected that the epitope recognized by ali12- <dig> might be inaccessible in some fraction of the apc protein.

one of the most clinically relevant applications for apc antibodies is for immunohistochemical analysis of tissues. we have validated the use of apc-m <dig> pab for immunostaining sections of frozen human colonic tissue and mouse small intestinal tissues. previously, apc has been detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of human colonic tissue, with more prevalent cytoplasmic staining in colonic tumors compared to normal tissue  <cit> . in our study of human colon tissue, apc-m <dig> pab revealed apc in both nuclei and at cell-cell junctions, partially colocalized with β-catenin, similar to previous reports  <cit>  . apc protein also appeared concentrated near the basal surface of epithelial cells  as previously reported  <cit> . apc staining became most intense in cells at the top of villi in the mouse small intestine  and in cells at the luminal surface of the human colon , consistent with a role for apc in differentiated cells. most importantly, apc-m <dig> pab did not recognize protein at the apical surface of intestinal tissues. thus, apc-m <dig> pab does not appear to exhibit the cross reactivity previously reported for some commercially available apc antibodies  <cit> . taken together, the apc-m <dig> pab is a useful antibody for future examination of apc in mouse and human tissue sections. at present, apc-m <dig> pab does not appear to recognize apc in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues .

intermediate filaments are essential components of cytoskeletal structure. recent reports have implicated apc in the regulation of cellular structural integrity through affects on microtubule growth directionality and polarity  <cit> . apc also associates with microtubule-interacting protein eb <dig>  and actin-associated protein asef  <cit> . our own previous screen for apc-interacting proteins identified keratin  <dig> . although classified as a hair cuticle-specific keratin, keratin  <dig> is expressed in a wide variety of tissues including mammary gland and lung and in human embryonic kidney 293t cells  <cit> . keratin  <dig> is also thought to be expressed predominantly in hair and nail. however, when flag-tag specific antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate flag-tagged human homolog  <dig> of drosophila disc-large  from human embryonic kidney  <dig> cells, keratin  <dig> was identified as a protein partner  <cit> . this observation is significant because it indicates that keratin  <dig> has a broader expression pattern than initially suggested and because hdlg protein itself is a binding partner of apc  <cit> .

downregulation of β-catenin activity by apc is not limited to the cytoplasmic destruction complex. association of apc with β-catenin in the nucleus appears to result in sequestration of β-catenin from the tcf/lef transcription factor leading to inactivation of wnt-responsive genes  <cit> . furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that apc associated with the enhancer region of a wnt-responsive gene in a similar temporal manner as several co-repressors, suggesting that apc can oppose a wnt signal by associating with co-repressors at the transcription complex  <cit> . given the emerging role of the nuclear lamina in gene regulation  <cit> , it is tempting to speculate that apc association with lamin b <dig> is yet another mechanism by which expression of wnt-responsive genes is regulated. moreover, finding apc associated with the nucleus after extraction suggests apc might be bound to the nuclear matrix. this observation is consistent with our previous finding that the majority of nuclear apc purified with the nuclear matrix  <cit> .

as a vital part of the cytoskeleton, intermediate filaments are dynamic and can stabilize cellular organelles such as the nucleus  <cit> . mutations in genes encoding if proteins are associated with a number of diseases such as monilethrix   <cit> , autosomal dominant leukodystrophy   <cit> , acquired partial lipodystrophy   <cit> , and various other lipodystrophies and cardiomyopathies  <cit> . apc potentially cross-links ifs to improve their stability or binds ifs to other structures such as actin filaments or microtubules. therefore, truncated apc found in the majority of colorectal cancers and also in other cancers, might have a compromised ability to link apc binding partners with different if proteins. it is worth noting that full-length apc has been found near ifs in epithelial cells from human colon tissue using immunogold electron microscopy  <cit> . given the evidence for an association of apc with ifs, it is predicted that disruption of ifs would result in apc redistribution. our attempts to disrupt ifs by treating cells with acrylamide led to cell shrinking, but not elimination of ifs . further study of this novel apc/if interaction using a related approach might illuminate the underlying mechanisms of intermediate filament protein-associated diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we identified an interaction between apc and intermediate filament proteins lamin b <dig> and keratin using a novel antibody, apc-m <dig> pab. the apc-m <dig> pab antibody is specific for apc, versatile, and reliable, with potential value in the clinical setting and in translational research. by sequential extraction of cytoskeletal components, we have shown that the association of apc with if proteins is not dependent on actin and tubulin. finding apc associated with if proteins confirms and expands upon the previous notion that apc is in close association with the cytoskeleton, raising the possibility that apc functions in the maintenance of cytoskeletal structure and integrity.
