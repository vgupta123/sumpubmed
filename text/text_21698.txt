BACKGROUND
of the predicted about  <dig>  million fungal species, only  <dig>  have been catalogued  <cit> . seven major groups ,  <dig> subphyla,  <dig> classes,  <dig> subclasses and  <dig> orders are recognized within the fungal kingdom  <cit> . thermophilic fungi in general have a maximum growth temperature at or above 40°c  <cit> . this is in contrast to most other mesophilic fungi by displaying a maximum temperature less than 35°c. among more than forty thermophilic fungi which have been studied  <cit> , five  belong to zygomycetes. the genera rhizomucor, mucor and rhizopus are classified under the family mucoraceae in the order mucorales, which is a primitive and early divergent group of fungi. the genus rhizomucor consists of mucor-like fungi that produce nonapophysate sporangia and branched sporangiophores but unlike mucor they form rhizoids. rhizomucor species are clearly distinct from mucor by virtue of their thermophilic nature and some morphological features  <cit> . the genus rhizomucor, as monographed by schipper  <cit> , contains two well-known species  that are thermophilic in nature and can grow at temperatures of 50°c or above  <cit> .

thermophilic fungi are important producers of thermostable enzymes that can be used in industrial high-temperature bioprocesses  <cit> . for a long time, r. miehei as a thermophilic fungus has been used mainly as a producer of industrial proteases and lipases  <cit> . the aspartic protease produced by r. miehei has been widely used as a calf chymosin substitute in industrial cheese making  <cit> . the lipases from r. miehei are well studied and commercially available in both soluble and immobilized forms with very high activities and good stabilities  <cit> . other extracellular enzymes from r. miehei have been characterized but have not been used commercially including fibrinolytic enzyme, β-glucanase and xylanase  <cit> . despite their potential industrial values, most members of the genus rhizomucor remain poorly characterized  <cit> .

currently, a few hundreds of fungal genomes have been sequenced, including important human pathogens, plant pathogens and model organisms  <cit> . the genome of industry-related fungi, like aspergillus niger  and trichoderma reesei , have also been sequenced  <cit> . comparative genomic analyses of three thermophilic ascomycete species, thermomyces lanuginosus  <cit> , thielavia terrestris and myceliophthora thermophila suggest that aside from representing a potential reservoir of thermostable enzymes, thermophilic fungi are amenable to be manipulated using classical and molecular genetics  <cit> . a thermophilic fungus r. miehei strain cau <dig>  newly isolated from self-heating hay in henan province of china, has been found to be a good producer of aspartic proteases and β- <dig> - <dig> -glucanase  <cit> . it exhibits a broad growth temperature ranging from 25–55°c and the optimum growth temperature is at 50°c. r. miehei has industrial potentials due to its abilities of producing extracellular enzymes. to facilitate future investigations, we sequenced the genome of r. miehei cau <dig>  in combination with transcriptome analysis, the mechanisms of thermophilic adaptation in r. miehei were investigated for developing potential strategies to massively produce thermostable enzymes.

RESULTS
general features of the genome
using a combination of roche  <dig> and illumina systems , the genome of r. miehei was shot-gun sequenced. the final assembly genome size is  <dig>  mb, n <dig> contig length is approximately  <dig>  kb and n <dig> contig is in  <dig>  kb. gene prediction was performed using different models, which yielded  <dig>  protein-coding genes with an average length of  <dig>  bp . total size of the genome is consistent with the estimation of approximately  <dig> to 29 mb from  <dig> separated chromosomes between  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb by pulsed field gel electrophoresis  . the r. miehei genome  falls within the size of most available fungal genomes that has a range of 10–60 mb with a median of 28 mb . this whole genome information has been deposited at ddbj/embl/genbank under the accession no. agbc <dig>

the average g + c content of the genome is  <dig> % which is higher than those of zygomycete fungi  but lower than most ascomycete fungi including three thermophilic ascomycetes, t. lanuginosus , t. terrestris  and m. thermophila    <cit> . since g:c pairs are more thermally stable, it is somewhat surprising that the g + c content of thermophilic r. miehei whole genome  and its coding genes  are close to those of the mesophilic ascomycetous fungi . however, the values are significantly higher than those of the mesophilic zygomycetes such as rhizopus oryzae, average  <dig> % and 35% for whole genome and protein coding genes, respectively  <cit> . the majority of predicted protein-coding genes contain multiple exons, with an average of  <dig> exons per gene and an average exon length of  <dig>  bp . introns are of typical length in fungi, averaging between 80 bp and 150 bp  <cit> . r. miehei genome contains  <dig>  mb of repetitive sequences representing  <dig> % of the assembled genome , which is much lower than that of r. oryzae   <cit> . the repetitive sequences in the r. miehei genome consist of recognizable transposable elements  including short interspersed nuclear elements , long interspersed nuclear elements , long terminal repeat  elements and unclassified interspersed repeats.

of all predicted genes,  <dig> %  of the translated proteins show sequence similarity to proteins in the known databases, and  <dig> %  in r. miehei cau <dig> can be annotated and attributed into different functional categories in gene ontology  . compared to other three zygomycete fungi, r. miehei encodes a larger number of proteins with go terms involved in protein binding group, electron carriers and transcription regulators in the molecular function category .

phylogenetic and syntenic relationships
the order of mucorales consists of genera such as mucor, phycomyces, rhizopus, and rhizomucor. however, the phylogenetic relationships among the members of mucoraceae and other fungi remain unclear. based on a total of  <dig> orthologous protein sequences, a phylogenomic tree also placed r. miehei and phycomyces blakesleeanus in the same clade while r. oryzae and mucor circinelloides in another clade . a phylogenomic analysis revealed that r. miehei and p. blakesleeanus diverged about  <dig> million years  ago, and r. miehei diverged about  <dig> my from r. oryzae and m. circinelloides .

we found that there are  <dig>  orthologues shared between r. miehei and other zygomycetes, m. circinelloides, r. oryzae and p. blakesleeanus. in addition to the common orthologues among r. oryzae and p. blakesleeanus,  <dig>  shared orthologues were detected between r. miehei and p. blakesleeanus while only  <dig>  between r. miehei and r. oryzae . these numbers also suggest that r. miehei is closer to p. blakesleeanus than to r. oryzae. syntenic relationship analysis of r. miehei with three other mucorales indicated that a total of  <dig> syntenic blocks between r. miehei and p. blakesleeanus were detected while only  <dig> and  <dig> syntenic blocks were identified between r. miehei vs. m. circinelloides and r. miehei vs. r. oryzae, respectively . these observations hence support the view that the genomic sequences of r. miehei are closer to p. blakesleeanus than to m. circinelloides and r. oryzae.

our pfam analysis identified  <dig>  protein families  in r. miehei, more than in m. circinelloides  and r. oryzae . a stochastic birth-and-death model  <cit>  showed that relative to the most recent common ancestor of r. oryzae and m. circinelloides,  <dig> families including glycoside hydrolase  families, phenol hydroxylase, metallopeptidase, lipase and transporter were expanded while  <dig> families  were contracted in r. miehei .

carbohydrate-active enzymes in rhizomucor miehei and other fungi
carbohydrate-active enzymes  participate in many important biological processes including cell wall synthesis, signaling and energy production. our analysis found  <dig> glycoside hydrolases ,  <dig> glycosyl transferases ,  <dig> polysaccharide lyases ,  <dig> carbohydrate esterases , and  <dig> carbohydrate binding modules  in the genome of r. miehei . comparatively, lower numbers of ghs, pls, ces and cbms were identified in r. miehei than in other fungi. in contrast, a higher number of gts was identified . comparative analysis identified cbm <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gt <dig>  gt <dig> and gt <dig> unique to r. miehei except r. oryzae  <cit> . relative to other fungi, the genome of r. miehei was particularly enriched with the gh families of gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig>  and gt families of gt <dig>  gt <dig>  gt <dig>  gt <dig>  gt <dig>  and gt <dig>  a ce family of ce <dig> and a pl family of pl <dig> were also found in the fungus .

proteases
proteolysis is ubiquitous in fungi, and is essential for protein degradation, amino acid assimilation and cellular differentiation. a total of  <dig> proteases  were found in r. miehei cau <dig>  including  <dig> peptidases and/or proteases, and  <dig> proteosome and ubiquitin related proteases. r. miehei contains a unique collection of proteases . forty three of  <dig> predicted peptidases contain secreted signal peptides. comparatively, the number of peptidases in the r. miehei genome is slightly higher than that of previously reported for a. fumigatus , a. oryzae   <cit>  and t. terrestris   <cit> , but lower than that of a. nidulans  and a. niger . also, the number of secreted peptidases is higher than that of other thermophilic fungi and fungal pathogens  <cit> .

lipases and esterases
lipases  and esterases  collectively known as lipolytic enzymes are important industrial enzymes for biocatalysis, biorefining, food processing, the chiralspecific synthesis of pharmaceuticals and fungal toxin degradation due to their ability to catalyze many different reactions based on hydrolysis and synthesis of esters formed from glycerol and long-chain fatty acids  <cit> . the r. miehei genome contains a diverse array of genes that encode ester bond hydrolysis enzymes. ninety seven genes belong to lipases, phospholipase and thiolester hydrolases  while only  <dig> genes are glycerol ester hydrolases including the main group of “true” lipases, triacylglycerol lipase. twenty nine genes belong to “true” phospholipase genes, lysophospholipase  and  <dig> genes being thiolester and sulfuric-ester hydrolases . other ester bonds hydrolases are phosphorus-containing anhydrides  consisting of  <dig> genes in total. there are  <dig> protein phosphatase genes in r. miehei cau <dig> genome. the main type protein phosphatase genes are serine/threonine protein phosphatase and protein tyrosine phosphatase .

cellulolytic enzymes
cellulose degradation is achieved through the synergistic action of cellulases , cellobiohydrolases  and cellobiosidases . specifically, there are four endoglucanases and eight β-glucosidases in the genome. fungal cellobiohydrolases are classified in the families of gh <dig> and gh <dig> while β-glucosidases constitutes a major group among glycoside-hydrolyzing enzymes belonging to families gh <dig> and gh <dig>  no genes belonging to families gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> were found in the r. miehei genome. only eight gh <dig> family genes were identified in r. miehei in contrast to those filamentous ascomycetes typically containing more than ten genes . otherwise, the r. miehei genome contains two putative endoglucanases  assigned to the family gh <dig>  which carry the sole cbm <dig> module. we also found two putative gh <dig> proteins , a family of endoglucanases mostly found in bacteria, plants, and occasionally in animals  <cit> . gh <dig> members are absent in most of ascomycete filamentous fungi but are also found in r. oryzae . the role of fungal gh <dig> remains unclear, but is probably unrelated to cellulose degradation  <cit> . two mannan-degrading enzymes in family gh <dig> may be responsible for mannan digestion. a new glycoside hydrolase was identified in r. miehei, which belongs to the family gh <dig> of exo-α- <dig> -mannosidases that contains one member from streptococcus pneumoniae  and the other one from clostridium perfringens   <cit> .

transcriptomes of the r. miehei cau432
the transcriptional profiles of r. miehei cau <dig> grown at two different temperatures  were investigated by rna-seq analysis . approximately  <dig> million high-quality reads were generated from each library, and 62% reads were uniquely mapped to the genome . a high percentage of reads  were mapped to predicted protein-coding genes, while  <dig> % reads were distributed in splice junctions,  <dig> % reads in antisense transcripts,  <dig> % in introns, and  <dig> % in other genomic regions . the frequency of reads which mapped to different genes ranged from one to over  <dig>  .

the expression profiles of r. miehei at 30°c and 50°c were compared using the degseq program . more than 90% of predicted genes  were detected with at least one read, while  <dig> genes and  <dig> genes were uniquely expressed at 50°c and 30°c, respectively . the results show that  <dig>  genes were differently expressed  by the fungus with more than two-fold changes . there were  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig>  down-regulated genes in mycelia grown at 50°c . these genes included ribosomal proteins, heat shock proteins, translation elongation factors, which involved in the protein synthesis. in contrast, the expression of proteasome subunits associated with the degradation of proteins decreased significantly . these observations implicate that both increasing the production and decreasing the degradation of proteins can be further explored for industrial usage for r. miehei mycelia grown at 50°c. many genes of the ghs, lipases and phospholipases were expressed at low expression levels in the mycelia grown at both 30°c and 50°c . furthermore, most of the proteolytic enzymes exhibited a decreased expression level when the growth was shifted from 30°c to 50°c . these differently expressed genes fall into  <dig> gene ontology groups . of note, more up-regulated genes were annotated with go terms of macromolecular complex and organelle part groups in cellular component category when the cells grew at 50°c compared to cells grown at 30°c.

discussion
we report here a genomic analysis of r. miehei, one of the most widely used extracellular enzyme producers. the phylum zygomycota contains approximately ~ <dig> species of true fungi. so far, over a hundred of fungal genomes have been sequenced and are publicly available. however, zygomycetes have been rarely investigated both genetically and genomically. results from this study suggest that r. miehei is closer to p. blakesleeanus than to m. circinelloides and r. oryzae, although rhizomucor, mucor and rhizopus are classified under the same family mucoraceae. r. miehei is well known for its capacity to produce large amounts of hydrolytic enzymes such as protease, lipase in industry. here, we focus on a potential reservoir of thermostable enzymes from r. miehei.

complete degradation of starch requires the combined action of three main types of amylases: α-amylase, glucoamylase and α-glucosidase. it is known that gh <dig> , gh <dig>  and gh <dig>  are involved in amylolysis  <cit> . all three main amylases are present in multiple copies in the r. miehei genome. specifically, there are six gh <dig>  seven gh <dig> and eight gh <dig> enzymes identified in the genome. of note, r. miehei contains the higher number  of family gh <dig> enzymes for starch degradation, compared to the other fungal genomes .

chitinolytic enzymes can be divided into chitinases  and n-acetylglucosaminidases . chitinases are members of families gh <dig> and gh <dig>  n-acetylglucosaminidases belong to families gh <dig> and gh <dig>  the genomes of filamentous fungi typically contain between  <dig> and  <dig> different chitinases  <cit> . in r. miehei, a total of  <dig> gh <dig> genes and three gh <dig> genes were found, a value similar to what is found in known ascomycete and basidiomycete species . a gene of gh <dig>  contains three cbm <dig> which has been found in bacterial enzymes and may bound weakly to several crystalline polysaccharides, while another one  contains one cbm <dig> with chitin-binding function . three genes belonging to gh <dig> are identified in the r. miehei genome and are possibly related to β-n-acetylhexosaminidases . unlike dikaryotic fungi, the cell wall of mucorales usually contains a high percentage of chitin and chitosan which are synthesized by chitin synthases and chitin deacetylases  <cit> . indeed, there are evidences that chitin and chitosan are an integral part of the cell wall structure and chitosan is a component of mycelia in r. miehei  <cit> . family ce <dig> which includes n-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylases  is important for the metabolism of chitin. r. miehei contains one ce <dig> member , similar to ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi. chitin deacetylase  as one of the members of family ce <dig>  hydrolyzes the acetamido group in the n-acetylglucosamine units of chitin and chitosan, leading to the production of glucosamine units and acetic acid. in r. miehei, a very large set of chitin deacetylases of family ce <dig> is found . most of the previously reported chitin deacetylases often exist in multiple isoforms  <cit> . a total of  <dig> ce <dig> genes were found in r. miehei which is only second to the previous highest number of ce <dig> observed in the rhizopus oryzae  <cit> .

in the r. miehei genome, there was a high number of serine endopeptidases , aspartic endopeptidases , metalloendopeptidases , and threonine endopeptidases  which belongs to proteasome proteolytic subunits. for omega peptidases, only two ubiquitin-specific peptidases  were found. as aspergillus oryzae is known to have prominent potential for the secretory production of various enzymes  <cit> , comparison of peptidase gene numbers between r. miehei and a. oryzae is shown in the additional file 1: table s <dig>  the gene numbers of  <dig> serine endopeptidases,  <dig> aspartic endopeptidases,  <dig> metalloendopeptidases and  <dig> threonine endopeptidases are strikingly larger than those for a. oryzae . the large number of predicted peptidase genes is consistent with previous studies describing r. miehei as one of the best protease producers among the fungi  <cit> . r. miehei cau <dig> has  <dig> genes encoding aspartic protease, only one  has been so far cloned, characterized and has reached commercial product   <cit> . the aspartic proteinase from r. miehei  has a very high thermal stability, which is probably due to the high level of glycosylation  <cit> . n-linked carbohydrates enhance the thermal stability of glycoproteins. the corresponding gene has 2 n-glycosylation sites. actually, most of other aspartic proteinase genes from r. miehei possess also multiple n-glycosylation sites. thus, various aspartic proteinases from r. miehei may exhibit excellently thermal stability among aspartic proteinases.

lipases and esterases are water-soluble enzymes that hydrolyze ester bonds of water-insoluble substrates such as triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesteryl esters. fungal lipases show remarkable levels of activity and stability in non-aqueous environments and are widely used in the catalysis of unnatural reactions such as esterification and transesterification  <cit> . r. miehei is also known to be a good producer of lipolytic enzymes  <cit> . although only one lipase gene which corresponds to the gene  has been isolated and characterized from r. miehei   <cit>  to date, there are  <dig> lipase genes in the genome . the number of lipases in the r. miehei genome  is higher than those of most of fungi  <cit> , and the number of secreted lipases  is above the average found in other fungi  <cit> . besides, r. miehei has a large number of phospholipase genes , and the number of secreted phospholipases is higher than that of human fungal pathogens such as malassezia globosa, malassezia restricta  <cit> .

thermophilic fungi can grow at elevated temperatures above 50°c  <cit> . thermotolerance is critical for r. miehei to grow at high temperature ranges characteristic of original ecological habitat niche. heat shock proteins , chaperones, ubiquitin and proteasome related misfolding protein degradation are highly related to heat stress response by regulating many cellular processes  <cit> . over expression of hsp <dig> in trichoderma was evidenced to enhance fungal resistance to heat and other abiotic stresses  <cit> . hsp <dig>  belonging to the intercompartmental transport proteins is thought to be important in thermophily for thermophilic fungi, was found to be highly expressed in the mycelia of r. miehei cau <dig> at 50°c. chaperones can mediate nascent protein folding, which is fundamentally important from thermophilic bacteria to plant  <cit> . in the r. miehei genome, there are  <dig> chaperone genes including heat shock protein families, dnaj, grpe, hsp factors, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase and other specific chaperones.

proteasome activator complex subunit  <dig>  proteasome subunits and chaperone regulatory proteins were significantly down-regulated at the high growth temperature. f-box/wd-box proteins, ring finger proteins and ankyrins, together with limited cullins, the positive regulators of scf-dependent ubiquitylation and subsequent protein degradation  <cit> , all showed an increased expression when the culture of r. miehei was shifted to the high temperature . these observations suggest that the protein synthesis and fate play important roles for r. miehei cau <dig> to grow under temperature stress. two related protein modification systems , whose proteins were designated as ubiquitin-like proteins  which play a role in dna damage repair under heat stress  <cit> . however, ubl proteins in r. miehei remain at low level of expression at both growth conditions compared to chaperone/ubiquitin/proteasome systems in the genome. apart from the hsps and dnaj chaperones, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, t-complex proteins, ubx domain-containing proteins, rotamases   <cit>  and vacuolar transporter chaperones were highly induced at high temperature .

non-reducing disaccharide trehalose, having the unique property of stabilizing membranes and enzymes against drying and thermal denaturation, accumulates upon heat, cold or osmotic stress  <cit> . trehalose-phosphatase is the enzyme in charge of final release of trehalose. in the r. miehei genome, three trehalose-phosphatases  and three trehalose-6-phosphate synthases  were identified. these genes were expressed at high levels when cells were grown at 50°c. of the trehalose synthesis pathway genes in r. miehei, five trehalases were found and two of them  expressed at high levels at 50°c. the trehalase genes of rhzm <dig> and rhzm <dig> showed stable expression at both low and high temperatures. compared to r. oryzae which contains three trehalose related genes  <cit> , the fact that r. miehei has many more genes expressed at high temperature, suggests that trehalose plays an important role in the growth of mycelia at 50°c.

CONCLUSIONS
the draft genome and transcriptome of r. miehei were investigated for the first time. we developed the fundamental genomic and molecular resources for characterization of r. miehei. r. miehei as a thermophilic fungus contains a large collection of genes for degrading its natural substrates, for coping different ecological conditions, and for mediating various stress during thermophilic growth. based on the existence of a large repertoire of amylolytic, proteolytic and lipolytic genes in the genome, r. miehei has potential in the production of a variety of such enzymes.
