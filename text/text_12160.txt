BACKGROUND
translation of mrnas that are missing stop codons stalls ribosomes and produces truncated proteins. to recycle stalled ribosomes and degrade defective proteins, bacteria use trans-translation, a quality control process mediated by a ribonucleoprotein particle composed of transfer-messenger rna  and smpb  <cit> . the tmrna acts as both trna and mrna through its trna-like domain  and a mrna-like region  with an open reading frame  that encodes a short proteolysis-inducing tag peptide  <cit> . in the majority of bacterial species, the tld and mlr segments are connected by four pseudoknots  . tmrna binding to stalled ribosomes is facilitated by elongation factor tu , smpb and ribosomal protein s <dig>  the smpb molecule mimics the d and anticodon arms that are absent in tmrna  <cit> . ef-tu binds to the t-arm of the tld precisely as observed in canonical aminoacyl-trnas  <cit> . protein s <dig> was found in e. coli tmrna:ribosome complexes that were assembled in vivo <cit> . s <dig> has been shown to bind to free tmrnas and tmrna:smpb complexes by contacting the mlr, pk <dig> and pk <dig>  <cit> . although essential for trans-translation in m. tuberculosis, protein s1’s contributions to trans-translation in e. coli and other bacteria remain poorly understood  <cit> .

cryo-electron microscopy  studies yielded a number of snapshots of the tmrna:smpb complex as it binds to the a site of the stalled ribosome and is accommodated in the p site  <cit> . the tld interacts with the ribosome similarly to a canonical trna whereas pk2-pk <dig> form an arc around the head of the 30s subunit. while tmrna maintains its overall structure during translocation from the a to the p site, the region encompassing helices 2a-2d  and pk <dig> undergoes significant conformational changes. molecular modeling suggests that pk <dig> unfolds, at least partially, as the tld is translocated to the e site  <cit> . this suggestion is consistent with our earlier studies demonstrating that pk <dig> could be reduced to a hairpin without affecting tmrna’s tagging activity  <cit> . although the resolution of cryo-em images is not sufficiently high for observing subtle changes in the single stranded regions of the ribosome-bound tmrna molecule, site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that the conserved nucleotides  located upstream of the orf together with smpb are instrumental for setting the correct reading frame on e. coli tmrna  <cit> . according to more recent cryo-em studies, smpb contacts at least five nucleotides upstream of the resume codon  <cit> .

in this article, we explore structure-function relationships in tmrna:smpb complexes using chimeric tmrna molecules that have been constructed by swapping equivalent segments of e. coli and m. tuberculosis tmrnas. although these tmrnas have very similar predicted secondary structures, e. coli smpb very poorly supports the tagging activity of m. tuberculosis tmrna on e. coli ribosomes. in contrast, m. tuberculosis smpb promotes the tagging activity of e. coli tmrna to nearly the same level as the e. coli smpb. these findings provided an opportunity to systematically scan the tagging activity the tmrna with the aim to identify incompatibilities with the tagging activity of the heterologous m. tuberculosis tmrna: e. coli smpb complex. our studies demonstrate that replacing the hp5-pk2-pk3-pk <dig> segment of e. coli tmrna with the equivalent segment of m. tuberculosis tmrna produces a chimeric molecule that efficiently tags truncated proteins in the presence of e. coli smpb. swapping helices 2b-2d, pk <dig> and the single-stranded segment upstream of the orf separately yields chimeric tmrna:e. coli smpb complexes with a decreased tagging activity. in contrast, replacing e. coli tmrna segments composed either of helices 2b-2d and pk <dig> or of pk <dig> and single-stranded sequence upstream of the orf with equivalent segments of m. tuberculosis tmrna yields chimeric tmrnas that tag very poorly in the presence of e. coli smpb. since smpb does not interact with helices 2b-2d and pk <dig>  our findings suggest the existence of an as yet uncharacterized tmrna feature that plays an important role in trans-translation.

RESULTS
in vivo tagging by e. coli and m. tuberculosis tmrnas
smpb protein binds to the tld to form a complex that mimics the shape of canonical trna  <cit> . cryo-em studies of the e. coli tld:smpb complex accommodated in the p site suggest that conserved residues 134– <dig>  of smpb are in close proximity to five conserved tmrna residues   <cit> . given that the orf and the pseudoknots of tmrna can be extensively modified without affecting trans-translation  <cit> , one would expect that tmrna molecules of similar size and secondary structure, like the canonical trnas, are active in heterologous trans-translational systems. to test this conjecture, we used tmrna, a fully functional derivative of e. coli tmrna in which the orf has been modified to contain eight histidine codons . in vivo, tmrna tags truncated ribosomal protein l <dig> with a histidine-rich polypeptide  to yield a fusion protein that is resistant to proteolysis and therefore can be easily detected in fractionated e. coli lysates by staining with coomassie blue or by western blot analysis  <cit> . to investigate the tagging activities of the m. tuberculosis tmrna, a similar construct, mt tmrna, that encodes the protease resistant adshqrh <dig> tag was synthesized . the plasmid-encoded mt tmrna was expressed in e. coli cells as efficiently as ec tmrna  <cit> .

the main components of our in vivo tagging system are six variants of plasmid pwow  that express tmrna-directed his-tagged truncated l <dig> in the presence of protein smpb. consistent with our previous studies, the plasmid-encoded e. coli tmrna and smpb efficiently tagged protein l <dig> in iw <dig>  an e. coli strain lacking both the ssra gene  and the smpb gene   <cit> . in contrast, the tagging of truncated protein l <dig> by m. tuberculosis tmrna and e. coli smpb was largely ineffective . no tagging of truncated l <dig> was observed in e. coli iw <dig> that was transformed with pwow derivatives encoding m. tuberculosis smpb .

further studies using northern blotting revealed that the mrnas for e. coli and m. tuberculosis smpb were expressed well in e. coli iw <dig> cells . however, while e. coli smpb protein was efficiently translated, no m. tuberculosis smpb protein could be detected in cell lysates using western blotting . this finding was unexpected because m. tuberculosis smpb cloned in a plasmid vector under the control of the t <dig> promoter can be efficiently overexpressed in e.coli iw <dig> strain . translation of m. tuberculosis smpb was likely repressed by inhibitory rna structures encompassing the ribosome-binding site in its mrna. such structures were predicted to form only in m. tuberculosis smpb mrnas that were transcribed under control of its natural promoter  <cit> .

in vivo tagging activity of chimeric tmrnas
to identify regions of the m. tuberculosis tmrna that impair its tagging activity in the presence of e. coli smpb, we constructed  <dig> chimeric tmrnas . all chimeras contained m. tuberculosis sequences within the hp5-pk2-pk <dig> segment known to have no role in the binding to smpb. in vivo tagging activities of chimeric tmrna:e. coli smpb complexes were analyzed by sds-page . as e. coli tmrna encodes a ten amino acid-long tag anhhhhhhhh , its activity produced a fast-migrating l <dig> protein derivative . m. tuberculosis tmrna and chimeric tmrna e <dig>  both encoding a 12-mer adshqrhhhhhh , produced slower-migrating l <dig> protein derivatives that readily bind to ni-nita magnetic agarose beads . unexpectedly, well-tagging chimeric tmrnas e2-e <dig>  all of which encode a 12-mer andehhhhhhhh, produced abnormally slow-migrating l <dig> derivatives. the abnormally slow mobility of the andehhhhhhhh-tagged l <dig> protein in a polyacrylamide gel can be explained by an enhanced tendency of protein segments containing histidyl residues to form a helical structure in the presence of sds  <cit>  and by an intimate link between increased sds binding to helical structures  <cit> .

coomassie blue stained gels were scanned, the tagging efficiencies of chimeric tmrnas were measured and compared to the tagging efficiency of e. coli tmrna as described in methods . figure 6a shows that replacing either pk <dig> or hp2b-2d reduces the in vivo tagging activity of e <dig> and e <dig> by  <dig> to  <dig> percent. replacing either the single-stranded portion of e. coli orf  or the single-stranded sequence upstream of the orf with the equivalent m. tuberculosis segments yielded e <dig>  and e <dig> that displayed approximately  <dig> percent tagging activity of e. coli tmrna  . the most dramatic decrease of in vivo tagging was observed in e <dig> and e <dig> that have either m. tuberculosis hp2b-2d and pk <dig> or m. tuberculosis pk <dig> and single-stranded nucleotides upstream the orf. this finding was unexpected because replacing individually hp2b-2d, pk <dig> and the single-stranded sequence upstream of the orf had a relatively small effect on the tagging in vivo .

to determine whether the tagging inefficiencies of m. tuberculosis tmrna and chimeric tmrnas e <dig> and e <dig> are caused by their poor binding to stalled ribosomes, we measured the ribosomal occupancies of e. coli smpb and tmrna. western blotting analysis demonstrated that the inefficient tagging of m. tuberculosis tmrna, and chimeric tmrnas e <dig> and e <dig> was not caused by the inability of e. coli smpb to associate with the ribosome . similar amounts of the ribosome-bound smpb were found in the efficiently tagging e. coli tmrna  and the extremely poorly tagging chimeric tmrna e <dig> preparations. northern blot analysis of the ribosome-bound tmrnas produced a difficult to interpret yet reproducible profile . ribosomal occupancies of the poorly tagging m. tuberculosis tmrna  and the efficiently tagging chimeric tmrna e <dig> were similarly pronounced while ribosomal occupancies of the poorly tagging chimeric tmrna e <dig> and the well tagging e <dig> were similarly reduced. this may be explained by a scenario where the tmrna e <dig> is either readily degraded or quickly cleared off the trans-translating ribosomes.

in vitro tagging activity of chimeric tmrnas
in order to characterize the chimeric tmrnas further, we analyzed their tagging properties in vitro. these assays were carried out in the e. coli t <dig> transcription/translation system for circular dna  and employed the plasmid petrpma-at- <dig> that encodes truncated l <dig>  <cit> . reaction mixtures were supplemented with purified transcripts of chimeric tmrnas and purified smpbs from either e. coli or m. tuberculosis.

the in vitro tagging pattern of chimeric tmrna:e. coli smpb complexes is shown in figure 7a. as demonstrated in vivo, e <dig> and e <dig> tag truncated ribosomal protein l <dig> poorly  at levels slightly higher than the degree of tagging observed with m. tuberculosis tmrna. this observation confirms that as yet uncharacterized structural features in the segment of m. tuberculosis tmrna encompassing hp2b-2d, pk <dig> and the single-stranded sequence upstream of the orf are responsible for the tagging inefficiency of m. tuberculosis tmrna:e. coli smpb complexes.

figure 7a shows that the chimeric tmrnas tag at different levels when analyzed in vitro in the presence of m. tuberculosis smpb. quantitative analysis of data derived from the in vitro experiments shows that m. tuberculosis smpb is more effective in supporting the tagging activity of e. coli tmrna than m. tuberculosis tmrna . given that e <dig> is the least active chimeric tmrna, the inefficient tagging of homologous m. tuberculosis tmrna:smpb complexes on e. coli stalled ribosomes is likely caused by the single-stranded nucleotides upstream of the orf. this observation is in conflict with an earlier study showing that replacing 85-uaguc- <dig> with 85-uaagc- <dig> in e. coli tmrna does not affect the activity of the mutant tmrna in the kanr assay  <cit> .

tagging activity of m. tuberculosis tmrnas derivatized with segments of e. coli tmrna
as demonstrated above, replacing hp2b-2d, pk <dig>  the single-stranded sequence upstream of the orf and the ssorf in e. coli tmrna with equivalent segments of m. tuberculosis tmrna affects, to a variable extent, tagging activities of chimeric tmrnas e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> . results obtained using chimeric tmrnas m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  constructed by replacing pk <dig>  the single-stranded sequence upstream of the orf and the ssorf in m. tuberculosis tmrna with equivalent segments of e. coli tmrna, were equally revealing . as seen in figures 5b and 5c, replacing the ssorf in m. tuberculosis tmrna with the equivalent segment of e. coli tmrna had the most dramatic effect on tagging activities of the resulting chimeric tmrnas m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  when tested with e. coli smpb, m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> displayed respectively  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold higher tagging activities than m. tuberculosis tmrna. in contrast, the chimeric tmrna m <dig> was the most active when tagged in vitro in the presence of m. tuberculosis smpb . the gradual increase of the tagging activity in chimeric tmrnas m <dig> and m <dig>  and the inefficient tagging displayed by the chimeric tmrna e <dig> derivative in the presence of e. coli smpb suggest that the structural relationship between pk <dig> and the sequence upstream of the orf is an important determinant for establishing proper interactions within the e. coli tmrna:smpb complex. because the tag template after the + <dig> codon can be replaced by many different sequences without any loss of activity  <cit> , it seems that the efficient tagging activity of the chimeric tmrna m1: m. tuberculosis smpb complex on e. coli ribosomes results from replacing the gca-aac sequence of the resume and + <dig> codon with the gcc-gau sequence. because changing the gca triplet for the gcc triplet in the resume codon has very little effect on e. coli tmrna tagging activity, the first nucleotide of the + <dig> codon is likely to enhance the tagging activity of chimeric tmrna e <dig> in vitro <cit> . this is consistent with a conservation of adenosine residues in the first two positions of the + <dig> codon  <cit> .

discussion
the ssra gene is present in all known bacterial and some organellar genomes  <cit> . its transcription produces single-chain tmrna molecules in most bacteria and two-piece tmrnas in certain major lineages that share similar architectures  <cit> . the most conserved features include the trna-like domain  and mrna-like region  with an open reading frame . as shown in figure  <dig>  they are connected to each other by a number of short helices  and four pseudoknots . the tld, hp2d, part of pk <dig>  a number of nucleotides in the single-stranded sequence upstream of the orf and the resume codon are highly conserved  <cit> . in contrast, the nucleotide composition and the length of the orf can be highly variable. because only the resume and + <dig> codons display biases for certain nucleotide triplets, a large portion of the orf could be replaced by unrelated sequences without affecting the tagging activity of tmrna  <cit> . such conservation pattern suggests that tmrnas, like canonical trnas, might be able to support protein synthesis in the distantly related bacteria. results derived from our experiments with tmrnas derived from e. coli  and m. tuberculosis  support this idea. both tmrna molecules tag, albeit with different efficiencies, truncated proteins in e. coli. m. tuberculosis smpb effectively promotes tagging activities of both the e. coli and the m. tuberculosis tmrnas. in contrast, e. coli smpb supports the tagging activity of m. tuberculosis tmrna very poorly. our present studies demonstrate that replacing the hp5-pk2-pk3-pk <dig> segment of e. coli tmrna with the equivalent segment from m. tuberculosis tmrna have very little effect on the tagging activity of the resulting chimeric tmrna e <dig> molecule. this is consistent with earlier studies, which demonstrated that extensive changes could be introduced into hp <dig> without significant effect on e. coli tmrna tagging activity as long as the base pairing of hp <dig> is maintained  <cit> . while interchanging pk <dig>  pk <dig> and pk <dig> causes only minor losses in tagging activity of mutant tmrnas, disrupting the structure of these three pseudoknots has a differential effect not only on tmrna tagging activity but also on its maturation  <cit> . together, these findings indicate that the role of pk <dig>  pk <dig> and pk <dig> is to maintain proper overall folding of the tmrna molecule.

replacing the ssorf in e. coli tmrna with the equivalent segment of m. tuberculosis tmrna reduces its tagging activity by about  <dig> percent. in contrast, replacing the ssorf in m. tuberculosis tmrna with the equivalent segment of e. coli tmrna increases its tagging activity to about  <dig> percent of the activity observed with an unmutated m. tuberculosis tmrna. the sequence comparison of the orf region in all known tmrnas shows conservation only in the resume codon and the + <dig> codon  <cit> . therefore, the increased tagging activity of the chimeric tmrna m <dig>  which uses gca instead of gcc as its resume codon, can be explained by the differences in the availability of trna isoacceptors that decode these two codons. according to earlier studies, the gca triplet is decoded by ala-trna1b that belongs to the most abundant trnas in e. coli and constitute about five percent of the total trna. in contrast, the gcc triplet is decoded by the trna <dig> isoacceptor that constitutes only about one percent of the total trna  <cit> .

the importance of the + <dig> codon for tmrna functions is highlighted by studies of o’connor  <cit>  and thibonnier et al.  <cit> . they demonstrated that translation of the resume codon alone is sufficient for both adding a minimal tag of two amino acids to a truncated protein and tmrna-dependent ribosome recycling in e. coli, respectively. however, when two stop codons are introduced immediately downstream from the resume codon, the resulting mutant tmrna is unable to complement the slow growth phenotype of e. coli lacking the chromosomal copy of the ssra gene. when tagging activity of m. tuberculosis tmrna is tested in e. coli, it is possible that the + <dig> codon  compensates a poor resume codon . this compensation relates most likely to the gau-decoding trna1asp that is more abundant  than the aac-decoding trnaasn   <cit> . however, additional studies are required to assess the contribution of the + <dig> codon to the tagging activity of the tmrna molecule in general and to explain why adenosine is preferred at the second position of the + <dig> codon in particular  <cit> .

the properties of pk <dig> and the single-stranded sequence immediately upstream the orf have been studied extensively. although residues 49– <dig> and 64– <dig>  of pk <dig> are conserved  <cit> , replacing pk <dig> with a single-stranded rna yields a mutant tmrna derivative that tags truncated proteins efficiently in vivo <cit> . tmrna sequence comparisons showed a strong preference for auag and auaa tetramers upstream of the resume codon  <cit> . mutations in these tetramers lead to either - <dig> or + <dig> frameshifting  <cit> . given that both e. coli and m. tuberculosis tmrnas exhibit the same sequence preference, a 27% drop in tagging activity of the chimeric tmrna e <dig>  which has m. tuberculosis single-stranded upstream sequence, was unexpected. equally unexpected was either total or almost total tagging inactivity of e. coli tmrna mutants having m. tuberculosis segments composed either of helices 2b-2d and pk <dig> or of pk <dig> and the single-stranded segment upstream of the orf. because sequences forming hp2b and hp2c are poorly conserved and because both e. coli and m. tuberculosis pk <dig> and single-stranded upstream sequence share almost all of the conserved nucleotide residues, the observed tagging defect must be induced by changes in the structure of the linker formed by hp <dig>  pk <dig> and a single-stranded upstream sequence. such changes are likely to affect the binding of smpb protein to tmrna. two copies of this protein are able to bind to a single tmrna molecule both on and off the ribosome  <cit> . one of them interacts with and cross-links to the t loop of the tmrna  <cit> . this interaction is believed to play a minor, if any, role in tmrna functions on stalled ribosomes. in contrast, the second smpb molecule interacts with two segments of the ribosome-bound tmrna. x-ray analysis revealed that it binds to the tld to play a role of the missing d arm and its c-terminal part of beta  <dig> strand mimics the anticodon loop  <cit> . moreover, the conserved residues of the beta  <dig> strand of the second smpb molecule orient hp2a toward the decoding site of the 30s ribosomal subunit. according to cryo-em studies, when the tld is accommodated in the p site, the 85-uaguc- <dig> pentamer in the single-stranded upstream sequence is in proximity to and most likely interacts with the residues 134– <dig> in the c-terminus of e. coli smpb  <cit> . as established by a number of earlier studies, this interaction is essential for a proper selection of the resume codon  <cit> . our present work revealed that changes in the linker region are able to inactivate the tagging activity of tmrna. given that both m. tuberculosis and e. coli smpb proteins support the tagging activity of m. tuberculosis tmrna, one can speculate that the structure of its hp2-pk1-upstream sequence linker better accommodates the requirements of both smpb proteins. future studies will reveal in detail the structural features in the linker region that tmrna needs to support efficient trans-translation.

CONCLUSIONS
this study significantly advances our understanding of trans-translation by demonstrating the existence of yet uncharacterized structural constraints in helices 2b-2d, pk <dig> and the single-stranded sequence upstream of the orf. although these conserved segments of tmrna are not believed to interact directly with smpb, they have a profound effect on the tagging activity of tmrna:smpb complexes. moreover, our finding that tmrna and smpb can function in heterologous systems extends the investigation of trans-translation beyond the standard e. coli model and provides opportunities to target the trans-translaton system of m. tuberculosis for pharmacological intervention against multidrug-resistant tuberculosis  <cit> .
