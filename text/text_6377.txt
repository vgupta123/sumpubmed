BACKGROUND
single-stranded dna-binding proteins  are indispensable elements in the cells of all living organisms. they interact with ssdna regardless of sequence, preventing them from forming secondary structures and protecting them from degradation by nucleases
 <cit> . in this way, they participate in all the processes involving ssdna, such as replication, repair and recombination
 <cit> . although there are differences in amino acid sequences, ssbs have a high-conservative domain, the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide–binding fold, referred to as the ob-fold, which is responsible for binding with ssdna
 <cit> . in the single-stranded dna-binding proteins described so far, four ob-fold domains form an active protein. these proteins also have the ability to bind rna and are present in all three branches of live organisms and in viruses. the cooperative binding of single-strand dna and rna, which is a property of ssbs, has led to their being used as tools in molecular biology methods and analytics. thermostable proteins are particularly useful in this respect. to date, only a few thermostable ssb proteins with these valuable applications have been identified.

information resources on proteins from cold-adapted microorganisms are extremely limited, particularly when the spread of psychrophilic organisms in the environment is taken into account; approximately 85% of the earth’s biosphere is an environment with temperatures of below 5°c.

we recently presented a study on the production, purification and molecular characteristics of a single-stranded dna binding protein from pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, the first report of a protein of this kind from a psychrophilic microorganism
 <cit> . the proteins which are the focus of interest in this article come from different phylogenetically-related obligate and facultative psychrophilic gram-negative bacteria. photobacterium profundum str. ss <dig>  which belongs to gammaproteobacteria, vibrionaceae family, was isolated from the sulu trough associated with amphipoda at a depth of 2551 m. it is a psychrophilic and moderately barophilic bacterium with an optimum growth temperature and pressure of 15°c and 20 mpa, respectively
 <cit> . p. profundum ss <dig> is a genetically tractable model system for studies of low-temperature and high-pressure adaptation
 <cit> . desulfotalea psychrophila, which belongs to deltaproteobacteria, desulfobulbaceae family, is a sulfate-reducing bacteria isolated from permanently cold arctic sediments off the coast of svalbard, norway
 <cit> . flavobacterium psychrophilum, belongs to bacteroidetes, flavobacteriaceae family, is a facultative psychrophilic bacterium and one of the most serious of the fish pathogens
 <cit> . the psychrobacter arcticus and psychrobacter cryohalolentis strains, which belong to gammaproteobacteria, moraxellaceae family, were isolated from permafrost samples taken from the kolyma lowland region of siberia, russia
 <cit> . p. arcticus was a model organism for studies on the mechanisms of adaptation to low temperatures
 <cit> . psychromonas ingrahamii bacterium, which belongs to gammaproteobacteria, psychromonadaceae family, was isolated from a sea ice core collected on point barrow in alaska, usa. the bacterium grows well at nacl concentrations of 1-10% and at temperatures of − <dig> to 10°c; no growth is observed at 15°c, and the optimal growth temperature is 5°c. psychromonas ingrahamii is the only bacterium growing at such a low temperature to have been described to date
 <cit> . psychroflexus torquis, which belongs to bacteroidetes, flavobacteriaceae family, is isolated from antarctic sea ice psychrophilic bacterium. the representatives of this species possess an uncommon characteristic, the ability to synthesize polyunsaturated fatty acids
 <cit> .

the aim of this study was to clone and overexpress d. psychrophila, f. psychrophilum, p. arcticus, p. cryohalolentis, p. ingrahamii, p. profundum, and p. torquis ssb-like genes in e. coli, purify the gene products and study their biochemical properties.

RESULTS
sequence analysis
the sequence analysis of the d. psychrophila , f. psychrophilum , p. arcticus , p. cryohalolentis , p. ingrahamii , p. profundum  and p. torquis  genomes indicated the presence of a single ssb gene. in the case of f. psychrophilum, p. ingrahamii and p. torquis, there were additional genes possessing sequences similar to the ssdna binding domain. the product of the additional gene from f. psychrophilum was a protein of unknown function, while that from p. ingrahamii was the prib. in p. torquis, it was a short , single-stranded dna binding protein without a characteristic sequence of last amino acid residues, in view of which, we omitted that protein from our research. on the basis of the ssb gene organization and the number of ssb genes paralogs, bacteria have been classified in four different groups
 <cit> . p. arcticus, p. cryohalolentis and p. profundum are classified as group iii, which contains bacteria with ssb gene organization uvra-ssb, whereas d. psychrophila, f. psychrophilum, p. ingrahamii, and p. torquis are classified as group iv, which contains bacteria with ssb placed neither between rpsf and rpsr nor divergently located to uvra.

the dpsssb, fpsssb, parssb, pcrssb, pinssb, pprssb, and ptossb proteins contain  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> amino acid residues, respectively, including the n-terminal methionine, as is apparent from the nucleotide sequence. analysis of the primary structures by rps-blast revealed the presence of two distinctive regions in the proteins in question: one putative ob-fold domain, from amino acid  <dig> to 105– <dig>  and one c-terminal domain, which contains four conserved terminal amino acid residues common in all known bacterial ssb proteins. the molecular mass of its monomers show a high differential, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda. besides the ob-fold, the c-terminal fragment has the characteristic of a highly differential length, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid residues. at their ends, the c-terminal domains have amino acids which are either similar or identical to the ecossb. the computable isoelectric point in these proteins has values in the range of 5– <dig>  which is typical for ssbs with the exception of pinssb, pi  <dig>  .

figure 
 <dig> shows the multiple amino acid alignment of the ssb proteins from the psychrophilic bacteria under study, from shewanella woodyi , mesophilic e. coli  and bacillus subtilis , and from the thermophilic thermoanerobacter tengcongensis  and thermotoga maritima  microorganisms. the protein sequences of the proteins under scrutiny share a 26-70% identity and a 46-75% similarity with the e. coli k <dig> ssb, a 21-53% identity and 38-66% similarity with the shewanella woodyi ssb, a 21-31% identity and 37-48% similarity with the b. subtilis ssb, a 21-36% identity and 36-53% similarity with the thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis ssb <dig>  and a 19-31% identity and 34-52% similarity with the thermotoga maritima . the similarity between these proteins refers primarily to the n-terminal domain and the four or five terminal amino acids of c-terminal domain which are common in all the known bacterial ssb proteins.

the c-terminal domain of bacterial ssbs contains a high number of negatively charged amino acid residues, which are required for the interaction with other proteins but are not essential to dna binding. in the c-terminal domains of proteins under analysis in this study, the content of negatively charged residues is similar to, or even higher than, that found in the ecossb.

the ecossb base-stacking residues are trp- <dig>  trp- <dig>  phe- <dig>  and trp- <dig>  in contrast to the tmassb or ttessb <dig>  the location of these residues is precisely preserved in the pinssb and pprssb. in the fpsssb and ptossb, this location is shifted with one amino acid residue, and instead of tryptophan, they have a tyrosine at position  <dig>  and arginine residues rather than phenylalanine residue at position  <dig>  the displacement of two amino acid residues is observed in the parssb and pcrssb, where the 86th position is occupied by tyrosine and not by tryptophan. in the dpsssb, the location of the base-stacking residues is shifted with four residues, namely trp- <dig>  and then with five; trp- <dig>  trp- <dig>  trp- <dig>  while tryptophan replaces phenylalanine in the 55th position. with the exception of arginine, the amino acids residues thus replaced are also aromatic and, in participating in ssdna binding, can play an analogous role to those residues in the ecossb. highly conserved his- <dig>  gln- <dig> and gln- <dig> residues, important for the homotetramerization of the ecossb, are present in the pprssb protein. in the other proteins under study, only histidine residues were found, at the 55th position in the pinssb, the 54th position in the fpsssb and ptossb, the 54th position in the parssb and pcrssb, and the 50th position in the dpsssb.

oligomerization status
in chemical cross-linking experiments using glutaraldehyde, the dpsssb, fpsssb and ptossb complexes were found at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 80 kda, the pprssb complexes were found at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of about 100 kda, the parssb and pcrssb complexes were found at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of around 116 kda, and the pinssb complexes were found at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 140 kda . we observed that the psychrophilic ssb proteins in question have anomalous mobility in sds-page gels than would be expected on the basis of their predicted molecular masses. this phenomenon has also been observed in ssbs from shewanella strains
 <cit>  and could be a characteristic feature of psychrophilic single-stranded dna-binding proteins. the ssbs from d. psychrophila, f. psychrophilum and p. torquis were found at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of around 20 kda , while their calculated molecular masses are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, respectively. the pprssb was found at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 25 kda, while its calculated molecular mass is  <dig>  kda . the parssb, pcrssb and pinssb were found at positions corresponding to molecular masses of around  <dig>   <dig> and 32 kda, although their predicted molecular masses are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, accordingly . taken together, these results confirmed our prediction that the dpsssb, fpsssb, parssb, pcrssb, pinssb, pprssb and ptossb exist as homotetramers in solution.

the oligomerization status of the ssbs was also analyzed by centrifugation in  <dig> to 30%  glycerol gradients. to prevent nonspecific aggregation of the proteins during the experiments, nacl at a final concentration of  <dig>  m was added to the solutions used for the gradients. the centrifugation in was carried out three times, and the same sedimentation behaviors were observed in all the independent tests. the sedimentation patterns of the ssb proteins in question, the phassb, the ecossb and the standard proteins in the glycerol gradients suggest that all ssb proteins under study form homotetramers in the solution .

an analytical gel filtration chromatography analysis of the purified psychrophilic ssbs revealed a single peak for each protein. as calculated using a regression curve equation, there was a peak with a molecular mass of 59 kda for the dpsssb,  <dig>  kda for the fpsssb,  <dig>  kda for the parssb,  <dig>  kda for the pcrssb,  <dig>  kda for the pinssb,  <dig>  kda for the pprssb, and  <dig>  kda for the ptossb, . the native molecular mass of each peak represents  <dig>  for the dpsssb mass monomer,  <dig>  for the fpsssb mass monomer,  <dig>  for the parssb, pcrssb and pinssb mass monomers, and  <dig>  for the pprssb and ptossb mass monomers, respectively. psychrophilic single-stranded dna binding proteins therefore exist in solution as homotetramers.

ssdna binding properties
the purified ssb proteins were analyzed for single-stranded dna binding activity. in these experiments, a fixed concentration of n  were incubated with various ssb concentrations and the resulting complexes were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis . when dt <dig> was incubated with increasing concentrations of each of the ssb proteins, a single band of reduced mobility was observed and remained constant even at a higher protein concentration . a band with the same mobility was observed for  <dig> at a low protein concentration, but a second band with a lower mobility was observed at a high protein concentration . when ssb:dt <dig> complexes were analyzed, a third band with a lower mobility was detected . this implies that the length of ssdna required for efficient protein binding is less than  <dig> nucleotides long.

in order to explore the binding properties of all the proteins in question further, we used fluorescence spectroscopy. all the bacterial ssbs which have been studied to date have shown a dramatic decrease of tryptophan fluorescence when binding to ssdna. with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, the emission spectrum of ssb proteins at 25°c reached its maximum at 348 nm, which is consistent with tryptophan fluorescence. on the addition of a saturating quantity of  <dig>  the intrinsic fluorescence at 348 nm was quenched by 93±3% for the dpsssb, fpsssb, parssb, pcrssb, and ptossb, by 90±3% for the pprssb, and by 81±3% for the pinssb. it was salt independent. the estimated binding site was determined as being approximately 30 ±  <dig> nucleotides long for the pinssb, 31 ±  <dig> nucleotides for the dpsssb and 32 ±  <dig> nucleotides for the parssb, pcrssb, pprssb, and ptossb. practically no binding mode transition was observed when changing the ionic strength from low to high salt . however, for the fpsssb, a binding-mode transition of 31 ±  <dig> nucleotides at low salt concentrations and 45 ±  <dig> at high ones was observed.

dsdna melting point destabilization
a destabilization of dna double strands in the presence of ssb must be expected as a thermodynamic consequence of ssb proteins binding specifically to ssdna and not to dsdna. the results of duplex dna  destabilization by the dpsssb, fpsssb, parssb, pcrssb, pinssb, pprssb, ptossb, and ecossb are shown in figure 
 <dig>  the melting temperature of dsdna in  <dig>  m nacl is decreased from  <dig> to 70°c by the dpsssb, from  <dig> to 69°c by the fpsssb and pinssb, from  <dig> to 67°c by the parssb, from  <dig> to 65°c by the pprssb, from  <dig> to 64°c by the pcrssb, and from  <dig> to 58°c by the ptossb. in comparison, the melting temperature of the dsdna is decreased from  <dig> to 62°c by the ecossb under the same conditions. the experiments were repeated three times with the same results on each occasion.

thermostability
the results of the indirect thermostability experiments are shown in figure 
 <dig>  although the proteins come from psychrophilic bacteria, they have a high thermostability. the half-lives of the ssdna-binding activities of the ssbs at 100°c and 95°c are  <dig> min for the dpsssb, fpsssb and ptossb, and  <dig> min for the pinssb. the thermostability of the parssb and pprssb was  <dig> min at 100°c and  <dig> min at 95°c, while for the pcrssb, the half-lives were  <dig> and  <dig> min at those temperatures. the dpsssb, fpsssb and pinssb proteins share half-lives of  <dig> min at 90°c and  <dig> min at 85°c. a 50% loss of ssdna-binding activity at 90°c was observed for the ptossb after  <dig> min of incubation, for the parssb and pprssb after  <dig> min, and for the pcrssb after  <dig> min. the thermostability of the p. torquis ssb was  <dig> min at 85°c and 80°c,  <dig> min at 70°c, and  <dig> min at 65°c. there is a 50% decline in the activity of the parssb and pprssb after  <dig> min at a temperature of 85°c and in that the dpsssb, fpsssb and pinssb after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> min at 80°c, respectively. a half-life of  <dig> min was observed for the fpsssb at 75°c and for the dpsssb and ptossb at 60°c. in comparison, under the same conditions, the activity of the ecossb decreased by 50% after  <dig> min at 100°c,  <dig> min at 95°c,  <dig> min at 90°c, and  <dig> min at 85°c.

when analyzed by differential scanning microcalorimetry , the thermal unfolding was found to be an irreversible process in the pcrssb, pinssb and pprssb, and partially reversible for the dpsssb, fpsssb, parssb and ptossb, as can be seen in the rescan thermograms . at melting temperatures  of  <dig> °c, 63°c,  <dig> °c,  <dig> °c, and  <dig> °c, respectively, the parssb, pcrssb, pinssb, pprssb, and ptossb had a lower thermostability than the ecossb which had a tm of  <dig> °c. the dpsssb and fpsssb, with tm of  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c, demonstrated more thermostablity than the ecossb, but still had less thermostable than the tmassb, at a tm  <dig> °c
 <cit> . the thermograms of these ssb proteins showed no characteristic signs of heavily aggregated proteins after heat denaturation. although the proteins under study come from psychrophilic microorganisms, they have a relatively high thermostability.

discussion
in this report, we have described the purification and characterization of single-strand dna-binding proteins from obligate psychrophilic bacteria d. psychrophila, p. ingrahamii, p. profundum and p. torquis and the facultative psychrophilic bacteria f. psychrophilum, p. arcticus and p. cryohalolentis. all the proteins investigated form tetramers in solution, as demonstrated by three methods: chemical cross-linking experiments, sedimentation analysis and gel filtration chromatography. the results of the sequence analysis verified that an ssdna binding domain in one monomer of each protein possesses a canonical oligonucleotide binding fold  very similar to that observed in the structure of the e. coli ssb. the ob-fold in the proteins in question demonstrated a high level of identity and similarity to ecossb, with dpsssb at 55% and 75%, fpsssb at 38% and 52%, parssb at 57% and 73%, pcrssb at 58% and 74%, pinssb at 61% and 82%, pprssb at 82% and 90%, and ptossb at 42% and 62%, which was somewhat surprising, given that they come from taxonomical distant microorganisms living in different environments. they show a high differential in both the molecular mass of their monomers and the length of their amino acid sequences. of the known ssbs with one ob-fold, the dpsssb is the smallest and the fpsssb is the shortest.

the parssb, pcrssb, pinssb, pprssb and ptossb have melting temperatures  of  <dig> °c, 63°c,  <dig> °c,  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c, respectively, which are somewhat lower than for the ecossb, at  <dig> °c. with tm of  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c, the dpsssb and fpsssb are more thermostable than the ecossb, but their thermostability is not at the level of that for the thermophilic tmassb, with a tm  <dig> °c, or even for the taqssb, with tm of  <dig> °c
 <cit> . the indirect thermal stability tests showed that both mesophilic and psychrophilic ssbs retain their binding activity at temperatures higher than their melting temperature for specified incubation times. these proteins could thus be used in molecular biology in high-temperature reactions such as nucleic acid amplification.

it is well known that cold-adapted proteins exhibit greater flexibility than their mesophilic counterparts, with a reduced number of weak interactions. this flexibility is often associated with the reduced stability of the psychrophilic protein. in comparison to their mesophilic equivalents, these proteins also often feature a higher gly content; a lower basic amino acid content, particularly arg, with a decreased arg/ratio; a lower pro content, resulting from pro deletion or substitution by other small residues such as ala, for example; fewer hydrogen bonds and aromatic interactions; and residues which are more polar, and less hydrophobic, resulting in the destabilization of the hydrophobic core. all these characteristics work together to increase the number of degrees of conformational freedom by introducing flexible residues on the protein surface and destabilizing the protein core by weakening the intermolecular forces. in this context, the dpsssb, fpsssb, parssb, pcrssb, pinssb, pprssb, and ptossb proteins have some cold adaptation qualities.

with the exception of the pcrssb and pprssb, the proteins under study have a charged residues content of asp, glu, lys, his and arg, with dpsssb at  <dig> %, fpsssb at  <dig> %, parssb at  <dig> %, pcrssb at  <dig> %, pinssb at  <dig> %, pprssb at  <dig> %, and ptossb at  <dig> %) which is higher than the ssb from e. coli, at  <dig> % . furthermore, the fpsssb and ptossb share a charged amino acid residues content which is close to that of the ttessb <dig>  at  <dig> %. in the thermophilic proteins, these residues may be involved in the ionic networks stabilization of the interdomain surface. in the dpsssb, fpsssb, parssb, pcrssb, pinssb, pprssb and ptossb, the content of arg residues and the arg/ ratio are  <dig> % and  <dig> ,  <dig> % and  <dig> ,  <dig> % and  <dig> ,  <dig> % and  <dig> ,  <dig> % and  <dig> ,  <dig> % and  <dig> , and  <dig> % and  <dig> , respectively. these factors are definitely lower in the psychrophilic ssbs than in their mesophilic e. coli equivalent, at  <dig> % and  <dig> , with the exception of dpsssb, and the thermophilic ssbs ttessb <dig>  at  <dig> % and  <dig> , and tmassb, at  <dig> % and  <dig> ). this feature has been considered as a hallmark of psychrozymes
 <cit> . the ability to form multiple salt bridges with acidic asp and/or glu amino acid residues and hydrogen bonds with other amino acids is normal for arginine. the decrease of arg content, even the conservative replacement of arg with lys, entails a reduction in the number of salt bridges.

the glycine content in psychrophilic ssbs, particularly in the dpsssb, at  <dig> %, parssb, at  <dig> %, pcrssb, at  <dig> %, and pprssb, at  <dig> %, and in the mesophilic ecossb, at  <dig> %, is much higher than in the thermophilic ssbs, at  <dig> % and  <dig> % for ttessb <dig> and tmassb, respectively. this accords with the known tendency of thermostable proteins to have a preference for a decrease in the gly content in positions of low structural importance for fold conservation
 <cit> .

the high content of glutamine and asparagine residues observed in the parssb, at  <dig> %, pcrssb, at  <dig> %, pinssb, at  <dig> , and pprssb, at  <dig> % is one and a half times greater than that of the ecossb, at  <dig> % and much higher than for the thermophilic ssbs, at  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the ttessb <dig> and tmassb, respectively. of the  <dig> glutamine residues in the pinssb and pprssb,  <dig> are located in the c-terminal fragment of the former and  <dig> in that of the latter, which represents, respectively,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of that domain. at up to  <dig> rests side by side, the glutamine residue repetitions in the c-terminal fragment of the pprssb are extremely numerous, endowing the domain with a highly hydrophilic character. this area is reminiscent of the ‘glutamine-rich  regions’ in proteins other than ssbs, which form a ‘polar zipper’ and with which different protein subunits interact in a specific manner.

the ratio of polar to non-polar amino acid residues is one of the major determinants of protein stability and increasing the fraction of polar and charged residues leads to protein disorder
 <cit> . the content of polar amino acid residues n, q, s, t, and y in the dpsssb, fpsssb, parssb, pcrssb, pinssb, pprssb, and ptossb is  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. with the exception of ptossb, this is considerably more than that found in the mesophilic ecossb, at  <dig> %, and very much more than that found in the thermophilic ssbs, at  <dig> % and  <dig> % for ttessb <dig> and tmassb, accordingly. russell
 <cit>  and zuber
 <cit>  noticed that psychrophilic proteins appear to have more polar residues than thermophiles or mesophiles do, which is consistent with our research. as mentioned previously, a lower pro content is one of the features of cold-adapted proteins. in the proteins under study, only the dpsssb, at  <dig> %, fpsssb, at  <dig> %, parssb, at  <dig> %, and pcrssb, at  <dig> %, possess a lower proline content than their mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts, with ecossb, at  <dig> %, ttessb <dig>  at  <dig> % and tmassb, at  <dig> %.

tiny and small amino acids were observed to be significantly increased in the beta sheets and loops of the psychrophilic proteins as compared with their mesophilic counterparts
 <cit> . their compositions in the ssbs in question are less than in the ecossb, at  <dig> %. moreover, the fpsssb and pinssb have a lower content of these residues, at 54%, than the ttessb <dig>  at 56%. the composition of the small and tiny residues in the pprssb, at 50%, and the ptossb, at 52%, is even less than in the tmassb, at 53%.

aromatic amino acid residues are known to play an important role in stabilizing the three-dimensional structure of proteins. psychrophilic proteins usually display a decrease in these amino acids. the psychrophilic ssbs deviate from this rule; all of proteins investigated show a higher content of these residues than the ecossb, at  <dig> %. the fpsssb has the same number of aromatic amino acids in its sequence as the ttessb <dig>  namely  <dig> %.

it was also observed that, in psychrophilic proteins, the number of hydrophobic amino acids is lower than for their mesophilic counterparts. the content of hydrophobic amino acid residues in the dpsssb, fpsssb, parssb, pcrssb, pinssb, pprssb, and ptossb is  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the number of these residues in the psychrophilic ssb proteins is less than in the ecossb, at  <dig> %. moreover, the aromatic residue content in the parssb and pprssb is close to that of the tmassb, at  <dig> %.

analysis of the amino acid sequence of the dpsssb, fpsssb, pinssb and ptossb shows the presence of cystein residues to a number of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. to date, these amino acid residues have not been found in any known ssbs. a residue such as proline or cystein has a significant impact on the stability and rigidity of the conformational structure of proteins. the presence of cystein residues in psychrophilic ssbs may affect their stability, particularly if disulphide bridges are formed.

single strand dna binding proteins have the property of causing the destabilization of duplex dna and the same is true of the psychrophilic ssbs under study. the greatest decrease in dsdna melting temperature was observed in the presence of the ptossb, at 17°c, which was a more substantial change than in the presence of the ecossb, taqssb or tthssb, at 13°c in each case
 <cit> .

studies of other ssbs have often shown that the size of the binding site depends on the salt concentration. at least two distinctly different dna-binding modes have been described for the ecossb, for example
 <cit> . in high salt concentrations,  <dig> nucleotides bind per ecossb tetramer, with a fluorescence quench of almost 90% whereas, in low salt concentrations,  <dig> nucleotides are sufficient to saturate the protein and quench its fluorescence by only 53%. our current study has demonstrated that the binding site size of the dpsssb, parssb, pcrssb, pinssb, pprssb and ptossb has a constant value of approximately 30– <dig> nucleotides per tetramer, with one, salt-independent, dna-binding mode. binding-mode transition was only observed for the fpsssb, at 31 ±  <dig> nucleotides at low salt concentrations and 45 ±  <dig> nucleotides at high ones. this is similar to the recently described psychrophilic phassb, with  <dig> nucleotides per tetramer under low-salt conditions and 54– <dig> nucleotides at higher ones. this suggests that the fpsssb and phassb undergo a transition between ssdna binding modes, something which is observed for the ecossb.

CONCLUSIONS
the results showed that ssb proteins from psychrophilic microorganisms are typical bacterial ssbs and possess relatively high thermostability, offering an attractive alternative to other thermostable ssbs in molecular biology applications.
