BACKGROUND
cotton  is the leading fiber crop worldwide and an important oil crop. cotton is a diploidized allopolyploid species containing two subgenomes designated at and dt. it is a model system to study polyploidization and post-polyploidization of plants. to develop tools essential for the genetic improvement of cotton and research in polyploid plant genetics, a number of genetic linkage maps have been developed  <cit> . as of this report,  <dig>  specific loci including  <dig> quantitative trait loci   <cit> , have been identified from  <dig> different genetic maps. many traits of agronomic importance to cotton production have been mapped with these important genomic resources. in addition, a number of large-insert bacterial artificial chromosome  and plant transformation-competent binary large-insert plasmid clones  libraries have been constructed  <cit> . a large number of expressed sequence tags , with a particular focus on fiber development, have been generated  <cit> . however, essential genomic tools are still in shortage, hindering further advances in such areas as dna marker development for fine-scale mapping of genes and qtls, genome-wide mapping of fiber ests, and large-scale genome sequencing.

genome-wide integrated genetic and physical maps have provided powerful tools and infrastructure for advanced genomics research of human and other animal and plant model species. they are not only crucial for large-scale genome sequencing, but also provide powerful platforms required for many other aspects of genome research, including targeted marker development, efficient positional cloning, and high-throughput est mapping  <cit> . whole-genome physical maps have been constructed for arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , and soybean  <cit> . however, no genome-wide physical map or chromosome contig map has been reported for any gossypium species including upland cotton . genomics research of cotton has lagged behind that of other major crop plants such as maize, soybean, and wheat.

upland cottons are thought to have formed about 1â€“ <dig> million years ago by hybridization between an "a" genome g. arboreum or g. herbaceum and a "d" genome g. raimondii  <cit>  or g. gossypioides  <cit> . the haploid genome size of upland cotton has been estimated to be about  <dig>  mb  <cit> . because genomes of the extant diploid species are only distantly related to those of cultivated tetraploid cottons, and upland cottons account for more than 90% of world production, the international cotton genome initiative  <cit>  has proposed that the cotton research community develop a genome-wide physical map of upland cotton  that is based on the genetic standard 'tm-1'  to facilitate integrated genomics research of cotton.

allotetraploidy of upland cotton presents a challenge in developing a robust integrated physical and genetic map and to specifically allocate contigs to their respective subgenomes. chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> have more genetic markers than the other pairs of chromosomes  and were proved to be homoeologous chromosomes by genetic markers  <cit> . in this study, we test the feasibility of anchoring a wide diversity of existing genetic map data to a contig-based physical map and accurately assigning contigs to specific subgenomes and chromosomes. in doing so, all available genetically mapped cotton chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> markers associated with enough sequence to develop robust bac library screening probes, were utilized, along with available bac library resources. having said this, we hypothesize that: 1) genetically mapped markers derived from ests and bac-end sequences can be located in the cotton physical map by screening bac libraries that have been fingerprinted and contiged, 2) that all other un-mapped est data can also be anchored to the physical map, 3) that the information in the physical map can be markedly enhanced by annotating all anchored sequence, and 4) contigs can be accurately assigned to their subgenomes as well as to individual chromosomes.

RESULTS
bac library screening
a total of  <dig> and  <dig> dna markers genetically mapped on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were collected from  <dig> published genetic maps . of these,  <dig> and  <dig> markers were associated with enough known dna sequence to be used for overgo primer design. after subjecting each sequence to overgo analysis,  <dig>  and  <dig>  overgo primers were designed for chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. of the overgo primers,  <dig>  and  <dig>  markers detected positive bac clones. in total,  <dig>  and  <dig> positive clones were selected from the three bac libraries  representing a  <dig> x haploid coverage of the chromosomes. on average, there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  positive clones for each overgo primer associated with chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, which is consistent with the  <dig> x coverage estimate.

in order to increase the genome coverage and cross-verify the contigs of the two chromosomes, all the positive bac clones identified by non-repetitive markers were pooled for each chromosome and the pools were used as bulk probes to screen the three libraries again. there were  <dig> and  <dig> additional positive clones that resulted from the second round of selection for chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in total, there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  positive clones that were picked from the original bac library plates for chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. these clones were then re-arrayed into  <dig> 96-well plates for fingerprinting.

bac fingerprinting and contig assembly
an initial total of  <dig>  positive clones from the three bac libraries were fingerprinted and the raw data was edited into fpc format via software "abi-to-fpc" . from the total number of clones,  <dig> clones  were removed following fingerprint editing because they either failed in fingerprinting or had no inserts. in addition,  <dig> clones  were ignored by the fpc  <cit>  program during contig assembly because they contained five or fewer bands providing insufficient information to be included in the contig assembly. thus, a final total of  <dig>  clones were successfully fingerprinted and integrated into the fpc database. between the chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> clones were shared between the two chromosomes .

the fpc database of  <dig>  bac fingerprints was subjected to contig analysis using fpc software. the parameters employed in the contig assembly were: cutoff range 1e- <dig> to 1e- <dig> and a tolerance of  <dig>  there were  <dig> and  <dig> bac contigs and  <dig> and  <dig> singletons produced for chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the average number of dna bands generated from each clone was  <dig> bands on a calculation using the whole fpc database. on average, each band counted for approximately  <dig> bp, based on an overall average insert size for the three libraries of  <dig> kb . there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique bands in the contigs for chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the sum total physical length of contigs was estimated to be  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb for chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

genetic loci, contig number and genome characteristics
on chromosome  <dig>  a total of  <dig> genetically mapped markers  were integrated into the physical map, which allowed for the anchoring of  <dig> contigs with an average of  <dig>  contigs per marker . four of the  <dig> markers hybridized with single clones and the four clones could not be assembled into any contig at the low stringency of 1e- <dig>  as a result, the four clones remained as four singletons and they were counted as four different loci on chromosome  <dig>  in addition,  <dig> of the  <dig> markers hybridized with one contig, indicating a marker dense single region in the cotton genome, given the adequate level of genome coverage provided by the bac clones, the data strongly indicated that this was a marker dense single-copy locus. on the other hand,  <dig> of the  <dig> markers hybridized with more than one contig, indicating multiple loci in the cotton genome. in summary,  <dig>  of the  <dig> markers were single locus, and  <dig>  remaining markers targeted multiple loci. of the  <dig> contigs,  <dig> mapped only to chromosome  <dig> while another  <dig> also mapped to other regions of the genome.

on chromosome  <dig>  sixty-five genetic markers  were anchored onto contigs or singletons, and  <dig> contigs were anchored by the  <dig> markers with an average about two contigs per marker. eight of the  <dig> markers hybridized with single clones and could not be assembled into contigs or merged with other singletons at stringency 1e- <dig> . as a result, the  <dig> clones remained as singletons and counted for  <dig> different loci on chromosome  <dig>  in addition,  <dig> of the  <dig> markers hybridized with a single contig, indicating that these markers were also representative of a single marker-dense region in the cotton genome. furthermore,  <dig> of the  <dig> markers hybridized with more than one contig, indicating that these markers had two or more loci in the upland cotton genome. in summary,  <dig>  of the  <dig> markers behaved as single copy, and  <dig>  markers had multiple copies in the cotton genome. of the  <dig> contigs,  <dig> were mapped specifically to chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig> contigs also mapped to other regions of the genome.

combining data on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  all the markers on the two chromosomes had an average of  <dig>  contigs per marker. this result is consistent with the fact that upland cotton has an allotetraploid genome.

homeology between chromosomes  <dig> and 26
using marker-associated sequence comparisons via blastn analysis, homeology between chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> was estimated to be  <dig> % . based on physical mapping data,  <dig> contigs were shared between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> with the homeology estimated at about  <dig> % between the two chromosomes in regard to extended genomic regions. both analyses depict the allotetraploidy of the upland cotton genome.

integrating cotton est unigenes with the physical map
for chromosome  <dig>  there were a total of  <dig> sequenced loci associated with  <dig> mapped markers and  <dig> bac-end sequences. after the removal of redundant sequences, there were  <dig> unique sequences allocated to chromosome  <dig>  at the time of this study, there were  <dig>  fiber initiation unigenes,  <dig>  elongation unigenes,  <dig> secondary cell wall deposition  unigenes, and  <dig>  non-fiber unigenes in the cotton community around the world. by use of sequence annotation via blastn with a matching criterion of at least 1e- <dig>  there were  <dig> fiber initiation,  <dig> fiber elongation,  <dig> scwd, and  <dig> non-fiber unigenes anchored to chromosome  <dig> . of the  <dig> mapped loci,  <dig>  had an average of  <dig>  unigenes per locus. of those,  <dig> of the  <dig> loci contained only one unigene and the remaining  <dig> had more than one unigene. because some ests were obtained at more than one plant growth stage, they were inadvertently counted more than once. a total of  <dig> fiber unigenes plus  <dig> non-fiber unigenes  were anchored onto the integrated physical map of chromosome  <dig> after the removal of redundant sequences.

for chromosome  <dig>  a similar strategy was used to map the cotton est unigenes. there were a total of  <dig> sequenced loci allocated to chromosome  <dig>  these included  <dig> genetically mapped sequences associated with est derived markers and  <dig> bac-end sequences. after removal of redundant sequence, there were  <dig> total annotated sequences assigned to chromosome  <dig>  by use of blastn analysis with the same parameters for chromosome  <dig>  there were  <dig> fiber initiation,  <dig> fiber elongation,  <dig> scwd and  <dig> non-fiber unigenes that were integrated into the physical map . in total,  <dig> fiber and  <dig> non-fiber unigenes  along with  <dig> marker-based  sequences were anchored to the physical map of chromosome  <dig> after removal of redundant sequence. of the  <dig> sequence characterized loci,  <dig> had only one est unigene while the remaining  <dig> had more than one est unigene. on average, there were  <dig> est unigenes allocated per locus.

in addition, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> function-verified ests were anchored by overgo hybridization into chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

the integrated maps of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> are shown in part  and in whole . there are  <dig> and  <dig> est unigenes exclusively located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. however, eighty-five unigenes  are also shared between these two chromosomes, indicating the presence of functional homeologs.

unigene distribution and gene-rich islands on chromosomes  <dig> and 26
est unigenes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  to analyze this statistically, we partitioned each linkage group into intervals of  <dig> cm in length. on the basis of the total number of est unigenes per interval, the poisson probability distribution function was used to identify bins that contained significant  excesses or deficiencies of various classes of est unigenes. as to the fiber gene distribution on chromosome  <dig>  a total of ten intervals were identified, and  <dig> of them were far larger than the average number and  <dig> smaller than the average. by outlier analysis,  <dig> intervals  were well outside the bulk of the data, representing distant gene-rich islands . as to the non-fiber

est unigenes on chromosome  <dig>  a total of  <dig> intervals had either more or less than the average number of unigenes by the poisson probability distribution analysis . however, none of them reached to an outlier. therefore, there were no non-fiber gene-rich islands on chromosome  <dig>  a similar analysis was applied to chromosome  <dig> where there were  <dig> fiber ests and  <dig> non-fiber est intervals  that had more or less than the average number of est unigenes. there were two fiber gene-rich  and three non-fiber gene-rich islands/outliers  in chromosome  <dig> . the total numbers of cotton unigenes anchored and gene-rich islands on the integrated map of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> were summarized in table  <dig> 

*gene-rich islands were identified by the number of est unigenes per  <dig> cm interval; distribution pattern was tested by poisson probability  and gene-rich islands were confirmed by outlier statistic standard analysis.

discussion
possibilities for a consensus map of the upland cotton genome
although several genetic maps have been constructed, most of them used different mapping populations with different population sizes. as a result, the genetic markers were often mapped at different genetic distances in different maps. this makes it difficult to study gene distribution, evolution, and map-based cloning between populations. this level of uncertainty also complicates the use of genetic markers to allocate contigs to chromosomes. in this report, contig  <dig> containing est-derived ssr marker nau <dig> and contig  <dig> with bac-end derived ssr marker tmb <dig>  cannot be precisely merged into the saturated genetic map  <cit>  because they were mapped with different populations. the genetic distance of a given marker derived from different mapping populations or from the same cross, but with different population sizes, is often significantly different. even if population parameters are the same, differences in the number of genetic markers used, can cause variations in genetic distance. for example, marker nau <dig> was mapped on chromosome  <dig> but at different locations;  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, in the same bc <dig> mapping population of tm- <dig> Ã—   <cit> . the optimistic point is that even though the genetic distances from different maps were different, the order of the markers in different maps showed an almost perfect colinearity  <cit> . recently, more research groups are beginning to exploit a permanent mapping population based on the ril mapping population of tm- <dig> Ã— 3â€“ <dig>  however, many markers located on other maps have not yet been integrated into the tm- <dig> Ã— 3â€“ <dig> ril. in order to use the previously mapped genetic markers to anchor contigs to chromosomes, a consensus genetic map based on the ril population is needed. this could be achieved in silico by mapping a subset of common markers for each chromosome in different populations. using this approach, it may be possible to obtain a consensus for marker order and recombination distances. on the other hand, integration of genetic and physical maps also helps align different markers from different linkage maps into a consensus genome map. a large contig having two or more markers in different maps could be used as evidence to align two or more linkage groups into one consensus map.

genetic distance versus physical distance in cotton
in our study, there was a lack of direct association between genetic distance and physical distance. a previous report in cotton showed that the overall average genetic distance between consecutive loci is  <dig>  cm with a range of  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm   <cit> . based on genetically mapped markers, an average interval of ~ <dig> kb between two neighboring markers was expected using a genome size estimate of ~ <dig> mb. if the genome size estimated to be ~ <dig> mb  <cit> , an interval of less than  <dig> kb between two markers would be expected. by our initial first glimpse into physical vs. genetic distance in cotton, one cm would account for an expected range of ~ <dig> kb  to ~ <dig> kb . in this study, contig  <dig> contained two sts markers; unig22h <dig> and gafb28i <dig>  with respective genetic position of  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm. the two markers are associated with fiber elongation ests and located in two overlapped bac clones  with a physical size of no more than  <dig> kb . the fact that these markers were spaced at  <dig>  cm and were located on two overlapping bacs could be indicative of a recombination hotspot and/or a fiber elongation gene-rich region. in comparison, two fiber est markers were anchored in contig  <dig> and co-segregate . in another case, there are two markers in contig  <dig> with a physical distance of no more than  <dig> kb and a genetic distance of  <dig>  cm . while more data is needed to estimate an accurate genome-wide ratio of genetic and physical distances, results from the comparison of these three contigs demonstrate the variation often observed in genetic to physical distance ratios and why it is so important to develop integrated genomic resources.

the choice of genotype is critical to the usefulness of any integrated genomic resource. in the case of cultivated cotton, the type and size of mapping populations are critical to obtain accurate genetic information. based on available genetic maps, it is then necessary to select the appropriate genotype from which to develop supporting genomic resources. as we noted above, among the  <dig> published genetic maps for cotton, genetic distances for most markers are variable due to differences in mapping populations. cotton geneticists have used populations based on f <dig>  f2: <dig>  ril, bc <dig>  and dh in addition to different population sizes. although a dh population has the advantage of being a permanent population providing many advantages in genetic map construction, it takes a lot of time and labor to develop a large dh population with semigamy structure. currently, the ril population using the upland cotton genetic standard tm- <dig>  is considered to be the best choice for genetic map construction. in fact, more research groups are using this population to facilitate data analysis and interpretation. it is especially beneficial that the current physical mapping effort in upland cotton uses tm- <dig> as a dna donor for the bac libraries. the combination of genetic, physical, and cytogenetic information from tm- <dig> makes the cotton genome data more accurate and valuable.

chromosome coverage considerations
even though all the publicly available dna markers were collected and used for bac library screening, there still remain gaps between the  <dig> and  <dig> contigs on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> with a coverage of  <dig> and  <dig> mb, respectively, that remain unanchored. by using standard genome coverage calculations, at least a 10x haploid coverage is needed to represent about 95% of the genome  <cit>  and a 20x coverage is needed to represent approximately 98% of the genome  <cit> . it is anticipated that an increase in clone coverage will aid in contig gap closure, particularly if alternative cloning enzymes are used.

in plants, many tandem repeats have been localized to specific chromosomal regions such as centromere, telomere, or heterochromatin by in situ hybridization, making them excellent landmarks for studying chromosome structure, function, and evolution. telomere regions have been mapped using repetitive sequences in tomato  <cit> , barley  <cit> , and rice  <cit> . in cotton, a chromosome-specific tandem repeat 572-bp b <dig> was mapped to a single  <dig> kb sal/i fragment in the dt subgenome chromosome d <dig> of tetraploid cotton. fish data showed that it was close to telomere region although not in the telomere region  <cit> . thus, more clones are needed to fill the gaps and more repeat specific repetitive markers are needed to identify centromere and telomere regions of cotton chromosomes. it is likely that telomeric and centromeric bacs are represented in the available bac libraries; it is just a matter of identifying them.

strategy to construct a genome-wide physical map of upland cotton
in this report, we present a strategy using four steps to construct an integrated map of one pair of homeologous cotton chromosomes  in a complex allotetraploid plant genome. the first step was to collect all genetically mapped markers with associated dna sequence and design overgo primers for bac library screening. the second step was to screen the upland cotton bac libraries and to obtain positive bacs. the third step was to fingerprint the bacs and to assemble them into contigs. and the last step was to integrate unmapped est unigenes onto the contigs providing a significantly enhanced level of map annotation. detailed physical maps of the horse y chromosome  <cit>  and papaya y chromosomes  <cit>  were constructed by the use of a similar strategy. the goal of this study was to test the feasibility of this approach in a complex polyploid genome where it is necessary to differentiate and separately characterize homoeolgous sets of chromosomes associated with different sub-genomes. our results indicate that this is possible and we are now in the process of constructing an integrated physical map for the whole genome of upland cotton. our results also suggest that additional genetic markers and an increase in bac library coverage would facilitate gap closure and the mapping of structurally important repetitive regions of chromosomes. however, positive results were obtained with existing resources as to contig allocation between homeologous chromosomes. contigs that were not anchored or were mapped ambiguously to multiple chromosomes could eventually be assigned to individual chromosomes by additional bac-derived ssr markers and snp markers  <cit> . in rice, a fine-scale physical map of chromosome  <dig> was constructed using this approach  <cit> . construction of an integrated physical map for an individual homoeologous chromosome pair in upland cotton lays a foundation for many genomic applications, including eventual sequencing and annotation of the entire complete upland cotton genome  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this integrated genomic map describes the first pair of homeologous chromosomes of an allotetraploid plant in which bac contigs were identified through the use of chromosome-specific probes and locus-specific genetic markers. the approach used in this study should prove useful in the construction of genome-wide physical maps for other polyploid plant genomes including upland cotton; est unigenes could be integrated into the bac contig map to construct transcript map of cotton by overgo hybridization and sequence comparison, and thus gene-rich islands could be identified for function genomics.
