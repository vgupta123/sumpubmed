BACKGROUND
diarrhea is an important disease affecting cattle worldwide. together with the bovine rotavirus , bovine coronavirus  and bovine torovirus , both members of the coronaviridae family, order nidovirales  <cit>  are the most common viral enteric pathogens. they both cause diarrhea and respiratory-tract infections in calves as well as in adult cattle .

coronaviridae members are enveloped viruses with non-segmented positive-sense single stranded rna genome  <cit> . these viruses share the same basic genome organization and similar replication strategies. however, there are marked differences in genome size, host range, and virion architecture  <cit>  and there is no antigenic relationship between these two viruses. the virions of corona and toroviruses contain four and five structural proteins, respectively: the spike , the membrane , the haemagglutinin–esterase  protein, the nucleocapsid  protein and the small envelope  protein  <cit> . the latter is not present in toroviruses. another specificity of some coronaviruses is the internal nucleocapsid orf coding for i protein  <cit> . variations in host range and tissue tropism of coronaviruses are attributed to the spike  glycoprotein  <cit> . this protein is cleaved by an intracellular protease into two functional domains  <cit> . the peripheral s <dig> subunit is responsible for virus binding to host-cell receptors  <cit> , induction of neutralizing antibodies  <cit> , and haemagglutination activity  <cit> . the s <dig> sequence is variable, mutations in this region have been associated with altered antigenicity and virus pathogenicity  <cit>  and this region has been exploited as a target to study the molecular epidemiology of bcov infection  <cit> . the sequence of the s <dig> subunit is more conserved and this subunit is responsible for cell membrane fusion activity  <cit> .

bcov infection has a high morbidity but a low mortality and is found worldwide among cattle of all ages  <cit> . outbreaks typically occur in autumn and winter  <cit> . economic losses can be heavy due to a marked reduction in milk yield  <cit> .

btov, formerly called breda virus, was originally isolated from diarrheic calves in breda, iowa, in  <dig>  until today, btov was described in diarrhoeic calves in various countries . the faecal prevalence of btov in calf diarrhea ranges from  <dig>  % in south korea  <cit>  to  <dig>  % in southern ontario, canada  <cit> .

there are no available published data about the viral agents that are involved in calf diarrhea, although reports of the farmers complaining in calf diarhhea are very often. in this work we investigated fecal samples of cattle from one large dairy herd and from four small farms during the 3-year period. we also characterised nasal and paired fecal samples from calves with symptoms of respiratory disease. so for the first time, the occurrence and the molecular phylogeny of bcovs and btovs in selected herds from croatia are assessed.

discussion
this is the first report on the detection of torovirus infection in cattle, as well as molecular characterization of bcovs and btovs in croatia. we determined the partial n and s gene sequences of bcov and partial s gene sequences of btov from i) one large dairy herd during 3-year period , ii) four small family farms  and iii) paired fecal and nasal samples from calves entered into feedlot . bcov vaccination is not practiced in croatia.

all croatian bcov n and s gene sequences are clustered together and with sequences from italy, denmark and sweden, separately from the cluster with respiratory strains and the reference strain mebus . in this cluster they were further grouped geographically as “b”, “k” or “d” subgroup. the similar clustering is obtained when aa sequences for n and i proteins were analysed . all sequences from the same subgroup were mutually identical when n gene was analysed. more diversity is recognized when s gene was analysed, but sequences from large dairy herd  were still 99–100 % identical. this lead to the conclusion that the same bcov strain circulated for extended period of time within one herd. in our investigation, we covered the s region from aa 387– <dig> which covers the previously reported hypervariable region   <cit>  but not the s cleavage site . samples obtained from small family farms  showed less mutual identity on s  compared with those that came from the same herd . the bcov strains obtained from respiratory disease showed two aa differences in the sequenced s region: , but compared to paired fecal sample, no aa differences and only two nt differences were found. previous researchers demonstrated that some bcov strains isolated from the respiratory tract had different biological, antigenic  and genetic  <cit>  properties compared with enteric bcov strains, whereas others did not detect any consistent differences  <cit>  and some suggested that the same strains of bcov cause natural outbreaks of respiratory and enteric disease  <cit> . our findings, although based on a minimal data are in agreement with the latter fact; there were no differences between respiratory/fecal sample pair. still, the identified change in amino acid  <dig> could affect the aa polarity .

regarding the herd designated as “d”, outbreak of respiratory disease followed soon after entry into a feedlot. those calves were also rt-pcr positive to brsv but negative to bhv- <dig>  bpiv- <dig> and bvdv. therefore, it was a typical scenario of bovine respiratory complex  as a consequence of stress from transport and change in husbandry.

the percentage of btov infections in the present study  is higher than that reported in south korea -  <dig>  %  <cit> , lower saxony, germany-5 %  <cit> , japan-  <dig>  %  <cit> , usa-  <dig>  %  <cit>  and canada-  <dig>  %  <cit> . still, conclusions based on these frequencies are not reliable because this study was not originally planned as an epidemiological study. according to previous study  <cit> , btov alone has been shown to act as a primary enteric pathogen in cattle. in our study, btov was found only in co-infection with bcov and brv-a . it is noteworthy to say that co-infection with brov-a had not influence on bcov and btov sequence diversity. despite the fact that btov causes diarrhea and respiratory infections in cattle of all ages  <cit>  our isolates from respiratory disease were negative. this also means that respiratory btov infection cannot be excluded if more samples has been analysed. croatian btovs showed moderate to high degree of nucleotide  and amino acid identity . comparison of our sequences with one available btov s gene sequence from europe  and four sequences from japan showed high degree of sequence identity  between our strains from large dairy farm  and japanese strain na- <dig> . on contrary, sequence from feces of calves with respiratory symptoms were more similar to european strain b <dig>  , and japanese strain aichi . phylogenetic analysis revealed that our sequences of btov s gene from symptomatic animals are more closely related to sequences from japan than to the breda  <dig> strain and european strain . still, fecal isolate from herd with respiratory disease clustered with european and other japanese strains and was more related to breda  <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
despite relatively small number of samples investigated, we can clearly conclude that bcovs and btovs  are common enteric pathogens of cattle of all ages and production categories in croatian herds. required steps in herd management should include raising awareness of the adequate and timely colostrum intake by the calf as well as vaccination of the cows with one of the commercially available vaccine before calving. although on minimal data, we have proved that the same bcov strain circulated for extended period of time within one herd but different strains circulated in different herds. molecular characterisation of those viruses revealed some nt and aa differences in relation to reference strains, but generally, croatian sequences are clustered with other, mainly european btov and bcov isolate sequences.
