BACKGROUND
asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. disease is mediated by increased levels of t-helper  <dig>  cytokines, interleukin - <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> and elevated serum ige  <cit> . the lungs are always exposed to the environment and its microbial components. infections of the respiratory tract are the most common diseases. epidemiological investigations have indicated that allergic asthma is a risk factor for pulmonary infection  <cit> . patients with atopic asthma also develop more infections than non-atopic individuals.

the innate immune system is the first line of host defense. it is responsible for the immediate recognition and regulation of microbial invasion. the innate immune system consists of a range of pre-existing, rapidly mobilized host cellular defenses, including neutrophils, macrophages, epithelial cells, mast cells, eosinophils, and natural killer cells  <cit> . airway epithelial cells are an active part of the innate pulmonary immune system and are capable of recognizing microorganisms and secreting host defense molecules, including antimicrobial and antiviral proteins  <cit> . antimicrobial peptides  have significant antimicrobial activity. cathelicidins are expressed in bone-marrow-derived and epithelial cells, and have antimicrobial action against bacteria, viruses, and fungi  <cit> . low levels of cathelicidin expression can increase susceptibility to infections  <cit> . th <dig> cytokines can inhibit antimicrobial host defense in individuals with allergic diseases, and treatment for atopic dermatitis with corticosteroids can cause a strong reduction in amp levels in both human skin and essential-fatty-acid-deficient  mice  <cit> .

glucocorticoids, which are widely regarded as the most effective treatment for asthma, can inhibit the production of most cytokines  <cit> . in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inhaled corticosteroids can increase the risk of pneumonia  <cit> . although glucocorticoids have a direct impact on the innate immune system, their effect on asthma remains unclear. to determine the effect of budesonide on antibacterial host defense and allergic airway inflammation, mice and a murine lung epithelial cell line  were treated with budesonide and infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa. our results show that inhaled budesonide suppressed pulmonary antibacterial host defense and this effect depended on the down-regulation of cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide .

RESULTS
effects of budesonide on lung inflammation upon exposure to p. aeruginosa
inhaled budesonide inhibits allergic airway inflammation, but the mechanisms involved in increased risk of lung infection in asthmatic patients exposed to bacteria remains unclear. twenty-four hours after the last dose of inhaled budesonide, histological analysis showed there was less inflammatory infiltration in ova-challenged mice treated with budesonide  than in untreated ova-challenged mice  . the cellular infiltration scores of ova/bud mice were lower than those of ova/no mice .

the cellular infiltration scoring of ova/bud mice was lower than that in ova. the scoring of ova/bud/p. a mice was higher than that in ova/p. a *p< <dig>  compared to ova; **p< <dig>  compared to ova/.a.

this confirmed that inhaled budesonide inhibited allergic airway inflammation in ova/bud mice. however, we observed different results when mice were infected with p. aeruginosa. after treatment with inhaled budesonide, diffuse inflammatory cell infiltration and lung abscesses were observed in ova-challenged mice exposed to p. aeruginosa . the cellular infiltration scores of ova/bud/p.a mice were higher than those for ova-challenged mice exposed to p. aeruginosa . this indicated that p. aeruginosa infection increased lung inflammation in ova-challenged mice treated with inhaled budesonide compared with untreated ova-challenged mice.

effects of budesonide on bacterial levels in ova-challenged mice exposed to p. aeruginosa
to determine whether budesonide can increase the risk of pulmonary infection in asthma patients, bacterial levels in the lungs were determined  <dig> h after infection of mice with p. aeruginosa. higher numbers of bacterial colony forming units  were observed in ova/bud/p.a mice than in ova/p.a mice  . the number of cfu in control mice, which received phosphate-buffered saline  instead of active bacteria, was zero. these data show that inhaled budesonide can reduce the clearance of p. aeruginosa and increase pulmonary infection in ova-challenged mice.

effects of budesonide on il- <dig> in ova-challenged mice exposed to p. aeruginosa
levels of il- <dig> and interferon -γ in the serum of mice exposed to p. aeruginosa were detected to determine the relationship between inhaled budesonide and th1/th <dig> immunoreactions for antibacterial host defense during asthma. the levels of il- <dig> in serum were lower in ova/bud mice compared with those in ova/no mice . however, the levels of il- <dig> in ova/bud/p.a mice were higher than those in ova/p.a mice . il- <dig> levels were lower in pbs control mice  than in other mice  . the level of ifn-γ in ova/bud mice was not significantly different from that of ova/no mice . there was also no significant difference between levels of ifn-γ in ova/bud/p.a mice and ova/p.a mice . ifn-γ levels were lower in ova/no, ova/bud, and ova/bud/p.a mice compared with those in pbs control mice   . these data demonstrated that inhaled budesonide could decrease il- <dig> levels in ova-challenged mice and that p. aeruginosa infection could increase il- <dig> levels in ova/bud/p.a mice.

effects of budesonide on cramp in ova-challenged mice exposed to p. aeruginosa
airway epithelial cells can be induced to secrete amps. whether inhaled budesonide can inhibit amps remains unclear. in the present study, amp was expressed in epithelial cells of normal lungs and in epithelial cells and inflammatory cells in ova-challenged mouse lung tissues . cramp expression was significantly lower in pbs control mice  than in ova/no, ova/p.a, and ova/bud/p.a mice. this indicated that ova and p. aeruginosa caused lung tissues to secrete amps. however, cramp expression was significantly lower in ova/bud mice than in ova-challenged mice without inhaled budesonide . cramp expression was significantly lower in ova/bud/p.a mice than in ova/p.a mice . thus, inhaled budesonide reduced the production of cramp during the antibacterial immune response to asthma.

effects of budesonide on the antibacterial host defense of lung epithelial cells
allergic airway inflammation suppresses the innate antimicrobial host defense  <cit> . however, whether inhaled budesonide can attenuate the antibacterial host defense in airway epithelial cells remains unclear. in our present studies, mle- <dig> cells were pretreated with budesonide. we observed that budesonide increased the levels of internalized gfp-labeled p. aeruginosa in mle- <dig> cells . total bacterial cfus were significantly higher in mle- <dig> cells exposed to budesonide than in those exposed to pbs. the effect of budesonide on bacterial cfus in mle- <dig> cells was dose-dependent . high doses of budesonide  induced significantly lower levels of cramp compared with pbs or 10- <dig> m budesonide  . thus, the role of cramp in antibacterial host defense may be interesting. incubation of mle- <dig> cells with cramp-neutralizing antibody induced significantly higher levels of internalized gfp-labeled p. aeruginosa and bacterial cfus than incubation with isotype igg antibody . this indicated that budesonide might attenuate the antibacterial host defense of airway epithelium cells by down-regulating cramp .

discussion
allergic asthma is a complex chronic inflammatory airway disease in which many immune cells such as mast cells, eosinophils, t lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and epithelial cells and cellular elements play different roles. the th <dig> hypothesis for asthma was first proposed by mosmann in  <dig>  <cit> . he identified two different subtypes of t helper cells in mice namely th <dig> and th <dig>  <cit>  that produced a variety of cytokines and were reciprocally inhibitory. th <dig> cells produce ifn-γ, il- <dig> and il- <dig>  which activate mechanisms important for defense against viruses and bacteria  <cit> . th <dig> cells produce cytokines , which are important in allergic inflammation and defense against parasites. the th <dig> hypothesis of asthma suggests that an imbalance in th1/th <dig> immunity plays an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma  <cit> . inhaled corticosteroids  are recommended as a first-line treatment for asthma by international guidelines. however, a study conducted by ma et al. showed that the early application of glucocorticoids was a risk factor for human enterovirus  <dig> infection  <cit> . recent studies have also shown that topical glucocorticoids compromise the barrier function of normal skin, especially during atopic dermatitis  <cit> . jamieson et al. showed that a sustained increase in serum glucocorticoid levels in mice with influenza suppressed the systemic antibacterial innate immune response  <cit> . in the present study, inhaled budesonide decreased the extent of inflammation and cellular infiltration in the airways and the level of il- <dig> in ova-challenged mice. because allergic airway tissues contain cytokines that promote bacterial infection and colonization in asthma and other lung diseases, th <dig> cytokines may be relevant to infection in asthma patients  <cit> . however, ova-challenged mice treated with inhaled budesonide and exposed to p. aeruginosa were characterized by the extensive infiltration of numerous inflammatory cells around bronchioles, alveoli, and blood vessels. this indicated that inhaled budesonide increased lung inflammation, reduced the clearance of p. aeruginosa, and increased the severity of pulmonary infection in ova-challenged mice exposed to p. aeruginosa. infection with p. aeruginosa was associated with increased levels of il- <dig> in ova-challenged mice treated with budesonide. thus, our study indicated that inhaled budesonide increased lung infection in mice with allergic inflammation exposed to p. aeruginosa, independent of levels of il- <dig> 

airway epithelial cells secrete numerous antimicrobial molecules that are part of the host’s first line of defense against microbial invasion. antimicrobial products secreted constitutively and/or inducibly by epithelial cells include lysozymes, lactoferrin, defensins, collectins, pentraxins, cathelicidin, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor , and serum amyloid a   <cit> . defensins and cathelicidins are primary amp factors expressed in the lung and secreted by airway epithelial cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and other classical host defense cells. another recent study demonstrated that il- <dig> and il- <dig> have an inhibitory effect on antimicrobial activity of the airway epithelium, as airway epithelial cells were unable to kill bacteria when incubated with these cytokines  <cit> . mice with allergic airway inflammation showed significantly more viable bacteria in their lungs after infection. th2-based inflammation was also found to suppress host defense and reduce amp expression in the skin  <cit> . thus, the adaptive immune system modulates the functions of the innate immune system and allergic inflammatory diseases inhibit antimicrobial host defense.

inhaled corticosteroids are currently considered the most effective means of reducing airway inflammation, symptoms, and morbidity in patients with asthma. glucocorticoids were shown to affect the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides in amphibian skin  <cit> , inhibit nf-κb signaling and induce immunosuppression in mammalian cell cultures  <cit> . mitchell et al. showed that bronchial biopsy specimens from dexamethasone-treated calves had significantly lower levels of tracheal antimicrobial peptide mrna expression than untreated controls. thus, corticosteroids may impair innate pulmonary defenses through the regulation of epithelial antimicrobial peptide expression  <cit> . tomita et al. demonstrated that glucocorticoids inhibited the release of β-defensin- <dig> stimulated by lipopolysaccharide in an airway cell line  <cit> . aberg et al. showed that psychological stress and systemic and topical glucocorticoid therapy down-regulated epidermal antimicrobial peptide expression and increased the risk of extracutaneous infection in mice  <cit> . roca-ferrer et al. demonstrated that glucocorticoid treatment could cause a modest  inhibition of spontaneous lactoferrin secretion in cultured nasal and bronchial mucosa  <cit> . however, whether ics can affect anti-microbial host defense among asthma patients remains unclear. in the present study, inhaled budesonide inhibited the production of cramp in the antibacterial immune response of ova-challenged mice. amp expression was localized to epithelial cells in normal lung tissues and expressed in epithelial cells and inflammatory cells in lung tissues of allergen-challenged mice. thus, inhaled budesonide suppressed pulmonary antibacterial host defense in an asthmatic mouse model and was dependent on amps.

inhaled corticosteroids induced candidiasis in clinical trials, but the association between the use of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with asthma and the risk of development of community-acquired pneumonia  remains controversial.

p. aeruginosa is the leading pathogenic cause of detrimental chronic lung infections, and is a major determinant of morbidity and mortality. asthma patients with bronchiectasis are not rare, and their conditions are often exacerbated by p. aeruginosa status. airway epithelial cells play a critical role in the orchestration of innate defense and inflammatory responses. p. aeruginosa can adhere to airway epithelial cells and internalization has been observed  <cit> . in the present study, budesonide increased the number of internalized p. aeruginosa organisms in mle- <dig> cells in vitro. the effect of budesonide on bacteria cfu in mle- <dig> cells was dose-dependent. high doses of budesonide significantly decreased cramp, which was associated with antibacterial host defense.

CONCLUSIONS
we showed that inhaled budesonide could increase the severity of p. aeruginosa infection in ova-challenged mice and attenuate antibacterial host defense in airway epithelial cells by down-regulating cramp. these findings may have implications for glucocorticoid treatment of asthma patients.
