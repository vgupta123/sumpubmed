BACKGROUND
acyltransferases comprise several families of enzymes with diverse origins and functions. the first acyltransferase recognized to be involved in phosphatydylethanolamine synthesis was identified based on the plsc mutant in escherichia coli, . over  <dig> acyltransferses are annotated in the uniprotkb database with a plsc signature  <cit> . in the arabidopsis genome,  <dig> proteins are encoded that contain this signature but the substrate specificity has been determined for less than  <dig> members. most of the plsc domain acyltransferases have two conserved domains nh4d,   <cit>  and fpegt,   <cit>  of which the former is also part of the active site. this broad family of enzymes accept at least two different acyl donors, acyl-coa and acyl-acp and several acyl acceptors such as glycerol-3-phosphate , and lysophospholipids and include members of 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, tafazzin and glycerol-3-phosphate o-acyltransferase enzymes . lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases  of the plsc type have been cloned and characterised from many organisms. much more scarcely represented are lysophosphatidylethanolamine specific acyltransferses . however, a bifunctional acyl-acp synthase having an acyltransferase domain of the plsc type was shown to be involved in uptake and acylation of 1-acyl-glycerophosphoethanolamine, , in e. coli,  <cit> . moreover, in synechocystis a broad acyl-acp specificity acyltransferase with 1-acyl-glycerophosphoethanolamine activity, and with a strong preference for 16:0-acp/lysophosphatidylglycerol,  has been well characterized,  <cit> . very recently a human lpeat <dig> was cloned and shown to be expressed in brain  <cit> .

in yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, a novel type of acyltransferases yor175c  belonging to the family of membrane bound o-acyltransferases  has recently been shown to represent a major acyl-coa dependent lysophospholipid acyltransferase  <cit> . knockout of ale <dig>  results in the loss of in vitro acylation of lpc, lpe, lpi, lpg, lps and lpa, but sufficient activity of lpaat is still provided for de novo synthesis of phospholipids by slc <dig>  . while knockout of either ale <dig> or slc <dig> results in no obvious growth defect, double knockout of ale1/slc <dig> results in a severe growth defect  <cit>  or lethality  <cit> , which suggests that together the two enzymes are indispensable for the synthesis of pa. a novel plant lpaat was identified by functional complementation of the escherichia coli mutant plsc by bourgis et al.,  <cit>  and in arabidopsis a plastidic lpaat was shown to be essential for embryo development  <cit> . by analysis of the arabidopsis genome and alignments of putative acyltransferases in a phylogenetic tree, fifteen arabidopsis genes encoding proteins that had both nh4d and egt motifs were identified  <cit> . among them, at1g <dig> was found, but to our knowledge was not further characterized. a second gene at locus at2g <dig>  less similar, was not identified, although it belongs to the same family of genes. in this study we have expressed cdnas from these two genes in yeast ale <dig> and slc <dig> knockouts and initially characterized their biochemical functions in vitro.

RESULTS
two uncharacterised proteins from arabidopsis,  were identified based upon their predicted amino acid sequence similarity to mouse lung lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase . both proteins possess an acyltransferase  domain, and one to several transmembrane spanning regions. only the candidate protein at2g <dig> was predicted to have an ef-hand/calcineurin calcium binding domain. a schematic drawing of the two proteins is shown in figure 1a. none of the candidates scored high for a particular subcellular localisation, but both were predicted to be in the secretory pathway using aramemnon topology consensus search,  <cit> . atlpeat <dig> was also er predicted in a study mapping the arabidopsis proteome  <cit> . analysis by atgenexpress indicated that mrna from both genes were expressed at low levels in most tissues with slightly higher expression in flower. expression of at1g <dig> was higher in the seed, while the at2g <dig> signal was lower at later stages of seed development, tair, ,  <cit> . as the codon usage of both cdnas did not largely deviate from optimized yeast codon tables, the cdnas were expressed in yeast to initially characterize their substrate specificity and biochemical characteristics. because of strong endogenous lysophospholipid acyltransferase activities in wt yeast, this study took advantage of the mutants of the lysophospholipid acyltransferases ale <dig>  and slc <dig>   to express these novel arabidopsis acyltransferases.

expression of the two putative lysophospholipid acyltransferases atlpeat <dig>   and atlpeat <dig>   in yeast ale <dig> showed that both proteins possess acyltransferase activity with long-chain acyl-coa and lysophospholipid substrates. time and protein dependence of reactions were determined for atlpeat <dig> with 18:1-coa and 18:1-lpe. the correlation coefficients were  <dig> ,  and  <dig> ,  between the variables, indicating good linearity of the assay .

based on the sequence similarity of the arabidopsis proteins to the mouse lung lpcat, we first tested the acylation of 16:0-lpc and found that this substrate was indeed an acceptor for the two enzymes, whereas 18:1-lpc was a relatively poor acyl acceptor when the acyl donor was 18:1-coa, . the highest activities in these assays were seen with the combination of 16:0-lpc and 16:0-coa for atlpeat <dig> whereas atlpeat <dig> preferred 18:1-lpc with 16:0-coa. the empty vector control reflects the phenotype of ale <dig>  which was well below the acylation rate of lpc of lines expressing atlpeat <dig> or atlpeat <dig> for most substrates . acylation activities in the lpeat transformants without addition of any lysophospholipid acceptor indicated there were endogenous lysophospholipids in microsomal extracts . this background activity gave hints on which substrates were preferred by the two enzymes, but the molecular species of these acyl acceptors might not represent acyl acceptors in arabidopsis tissues.

assays with 16:0-lpe and 18:1-lpe with different combinations of 16:0-coa and 18:1-coa showed that both arabidopsis acyltransferases were more active with these acyl acceptors than with lpc . atlpeat <dig> was more active with both lpe substrates than atlpeat <dig>  both enzymes had highest activity with 16:0-coa and 18:1-lpe. di-18:1-pe and di-16:0-pe were equally well synthesized as by atlpeat <dig> .

a faint spot of pa was also an identified product when no acyl acceptor was added . as ale <dig> has considerable endogenous lpaat activity we also expressed the two arabidopsis acyltransferase in slc <dig> to allow more reliable lpaat assays. as shown in figure  <dig>  atlpeat <dig> had substantial lpaat activities whereas atlpeat <dig> only exhibited activity just above background. the best acyl donor was 16:0-coa in both yeast knockout backgrounds and there was a slight difference in acyl preference in the control reactions in two backgrounds , presumably reflecting the different specificities of yeast acyltransferases slc <dig> in ale <dig> and ale <dig> in slc <dig>  . 16:0-lps was a poor substrate for acylation by either of the two atlpeats, although substantially above background, and both enzymes showed similar preference for 16:0-coa as an acyl donor over 18:1-coa .

the possibility that the c-terminal ef-hand calcium binding domain provided regulation by calcium was tested by adding cacl <dig> to the assay mixtures. however, neither of the two atlpeats activities was dramatically affected by this addition nor by edta . assaying ph dependency of the two arabidopsis constructs expressed in yeast ale <dig> was done in  <dig> mm tris buffer. in this analysis, atlpeat <dig> exhibited an almost linear increase in response at ph  <dig>  â€“  <dig> , while atlpeat <dig> had constant activities over this same ph interval .

discussion
our initial attempt to characterise atlpeat <dig> and atlpeat <dig> by expression in wild-type yeast was obscured due to high background lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase activities of ale <dig> lpcat. however, recent cloning and characterisation of ale <dig> in yeast made it possible to characterize our candidate proteins in a low background strain containing a kanmx <dig> knockout of this gene. since ale <dig> has almost no lysophospholipid acyltransferase activities except for lpaat,  <cit> , expression in this mutant should reflect the substrate specificities of the candidate acyltransferases. however as one of the arabidopsis enzymes turned out to have strong dual activity with high lpaat activity, we also decided to express the arabidopsis acyltransferases in the yeast, slc <dig> knockout. the slc <dig> gene was cloned as a suppressor gene which enabled yeast to grow without sphingolipid synthesis and was shown to code for an lpaat protein  <cit> . utilizing these yeast mutants for gal induced expression of atlpeat <dig> and atlpeat <dig> we found a remarkable difference in preference for lpa between the two enzymes. atlpeat <dig> preferred 16:0-coa eight fold over 18:1-coa using 16:0-lpa as an acyl acceptor. the increase of lpaat activity was more pronounced in slc <dig> , than in ale <dig> . this selectivity of 16:0-coa is somewhat similar to the arabidopsis lpaat <dig>  preference, although the acyl acceptor in their assay was 18:1-lpa,  <cit> . four other arabidopsis lpaats  were later isolated and characterized for their acyl donor specificities  <cit> . all four lpaats possessed higher in vitro activity with 18:1-coa than 16:0-coa when expressed in wild-type yeast. atlpeat <dig> exhibited strong selectivity depending on the combination of acyl acceptor and acyl donor in the acylation of lpe and lpa. the best acceptor was 18:1-lpe in combination with 16:0-coa. atlpeat <dig> lacked acylation capability of lpa except for a low rate of formation of di-16:0-pa. like atlpeat <dig>  atlpeat <dig> showed the highest specific activity with 18:1-lpe in combination with 16:0-coa.

the sequence homology of atlpeats to mammalian lpcats is intriguing . an alignment over the region containing the plsc domain of these evolutionarily distantly related proteins distinguishes these acyltransferases from other plsc domain containing proteins distal of the fpegt site. using the fpegt motif and an adjacent  <dig> aa of atlpeat <dig> in a blast search of the non-redundant protein database retrieved exclusively this family. as can be seen in figure 1c atlpeat <dig> has a glutamate  instead of the otherwise completely conserved aspartate  in the catalytic site. the mouse lung lpcat <dig>  highly homologous to human,  and mouse/rat lpcat, has been shown to have preference for saturated fatty acids of both acceptors and donors  <cit> , while aytl <dig> a human lpeat <dig> showed no such preference for acyl-coas  <cit> . lpe was also a substrate for this enzyme, but in contrast to the two atlpeats it preferred lpc over lpe. the ph optimum for the mouse lung lpcat was between  <dig>  and  <dig>  and the reaction did not require ca2+. neither of the two atlpeats required ca2+. in contrast, the human hslpcat  exhibiting ef <dig> and ef2-hand domains as atlpeat <dig>  was shown to be inhibited by ca2+,  <cit>  while hslpeat <dig> was not effected by ca2+  <cit> . atlpeat <dig> had a completely different response to ph  <dig>  â€“  <dig>  while atlpeat <dig> resembled the human lpcats by being non sensitive within that ph range.

in eukaryotes, synthesis of pe occurs by three different pathways. decarboxylation of ps, phosphoethanolamine transfer from cdp-ethanolamine to diacylglycerol and base exchange of the headgroup, . in arabidopsis, ctp:phosphorylethanolamine cytidylyltransferase,  mutants exhibit a decrease of phosphatidylethanolamine and increase in phosphatidylcholine and embryo abortion,  <cit> . both atlpeats were predicted to be in the secretory pathway and pe is known to be a rather specific target for plant secretory phospholipases a <dig>   <cit> . this type of phospholipase requires ca2+ for activity and has no acyl chain preference  <cit> . auxin has been shown to induce and increase the levels of free fatty acids, lpc and lpe in microsomes  <cit>  and lpe is also known to retard senescence, which might be related to lpe's inhibitory effect of phospholipase d  <cit> . overexpression of atspl a <dig> in arabidopsis results in prolonged leaf petiols and inflorescence stems and general cell elongation  <cit> . whether the atlpeats described in this study have a function in relation to pl a2on induced responses or in organogenesis remains to be seen. related to developmental cues is the generation of fatty acids for membrane synthesis. in vitro acylation of pc and pe in arabidopsis showed that the ratio of labelling of pe to pc was highly different in root and leaf and specific pe remodelling by acylation has been demonstrated to be the cause of the remodelling  <cit> , atlpeat <dig> and atlpat <dig> are obvious candidates involved in such remodelling.

the specific activity  of the lpeats in the yeast microsomes were similar or higher than other lysophosphatidyl enzymes assayed under similar conditions. the acyl acceptors used in our assays were sn-1-acyl lysophospholipids and thus acylation occurred at the sn- <dig> position. it should be noted that palmitoyl-coa was found to be the best acyl donor by the two atlpeats despite the fact that palmitate is primarily confined to the sn- <dig> position of plant pe. there are substantial problems to assay the sn- <dig> acylation activity of lysophospholipid acyltransferases because the sn- <dig> lysophospholipid substrates are unstable due to rapid acyl migration to the sn- <dig> position. since the positional specificity of the lpeats were not studied in this work, we can not infer any positional preference of the enzymes and cannot rule out that an additional in-vivo acyl acceptor for the atlpeats in plants might be sn-2-acyl lysophospholipids.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, backward transacylation reaction,  <cit>  and/or hydrolysis of phospholipids in combination with forward lysophosphatidyl acyltransferases reaction could at least partly be maintained by the atlpeats described herein. the difference in expression pattern of the two atlpeats, together with their different biochemical properties, suggest that the two atlpeat homologues have partly different functions in membrane metabolism/homoeostasis. future studies of arabidopsis that are mutated or have overexpressed lpeat genes are likely to give valuable information about their physiological functions.
