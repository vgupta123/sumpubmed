BACKGROUND
secondary metabolites , are compounds synthesized by plants for attracting pollinators
 <cit> , inter-plant communication
 <cit> , and defense
 <cit> . the plethora of natural products synthesized by plants also provides many valuable pharmaceutical compounds. catharanthus roseus  g. don, commonly called madagascar periwinkle or annual vinca, belongs to the apocynaceae family and synthesizes over  <dig> terpene indole alkaloids  including the pharmaceutically valuable vinblastine and vincristine. vinblastine and vincristine provide antineoplastic compounds effective in the treatment of several types of cancer
 <cit> . the biosynthesis of these compounds, along with other tias, is regulated by uv light
 <cit> , fungal elicitors
 <cit> , wounding
 <cit> , drought
 <cit> , cold
 <cit>  and salt stress
 <cit> . a principal elicitor of tia production in catharanthus, as well as natural products in many other medicinal species, is the phytohormone jasmonate which functions in plant defense signaling to protect the plant from biotic stresses
 <cit> .

transcription factors  play a critical role in responding to jasmonate to elicit the synthesis of tias in catharanthus
 <cit> –
 <cit> . negative regulators also mediate jasmonate signaling of the tia pathway in catharanthus
 <cit> . in plants, wrky tfs are critical regulators of response to biotic and abiotic stress. wrky tfs have been attributed to tolerance of drought
 <cit> , salt
 <cit> , nutrient deficiency
 <cit> , osmotic
 <cit> , cold
 <cit> , heat
 <cit> , oxidative
 <cit> , wounding
 <cit> , pathogens
 <cit> , and uv-b stresses
 <cit> . the wrky tf family is primarily a plant specific family with the exception of several examples in protozoa
 <cit> . the wrky domain is a  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid long dna binding domain that recognizes the w-box ; however, recent studies suggest this cis-element may be more degenerate and other components are involved for wrky binding to dna in response to a specific stimulus
 <cit> . the n-terminal portion of the wrky domain is characterized by a highly conserved wrkygqk motif whereas the c-terminal region of the domain contains either a cys2-his <dig> or cys2-his-cys zinc-finger
 <cit> . wrky tfs are distinguished by the presence of one or two wrky domains. group i wrkys typically contain two wrky domains whereas group ii and group iii members only contain one wrky domain
 <cit> . up to five subgroups  are recognized in the group ii wrky tfs
 <cit> .

in arabidopsis, wrky tfs are well established in salicylic acid  and defense signaling pathways
 <cit> –
 <cit> . the majority of arabidopsis wrky tfs are induced by treatment with sa
 <cit> . however, the importance of wrky tfs in ja signaling network is relatively less studied. li et al.
 <cit>  identified atwrky <dig> as a positive regulator of sa signaling and negative regulator of jasmonate signaling. mutation of atwrky <dig> enhances susceptibility to necrotrophic pathogens by up-regulating jaz proteins, repressors of jasmonate signaling
 <cit> . jasmonate positively regulates atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> which also negatively regulate abscisic acid  response
 <cit> . atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  and atwrky <dig> are also differentially expressed by jasmonates to regulate plant defense
 <cit> –
 <cit> .

over the last several years, wrky tfs have emerged as a key family in the induction of natural product biosynthesis
 <cit> . cjwrky <dig>  from coptis japonica, regulates the production of the benzylisoquinoline alkaloid, berberine
 <cit> . cotton  gawrky <dig> affects the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene, gossypol
 <cit> . multiple biosynthetic genes for the sesquiterpene lactone, artemisinin, valuable as an anti-malaria drug, are regulated by artemisia annua wrky1
 <cit> . hevea brasiliensis wrky <dig> is present in the latex of mechanically wounded  trees suggesting involvement in rubber latex synthesis
 <cit> . the taxus chinensis wrky <dig> was found to regulate the expression of 10-deacetylbaccatin iii- <dig> b-o-acetyl transferase , a gene encoding a key enzyme catalyzing a rate limiting step in the biosynthesis of the anticancer terpene, paclitaxel
 <cit> . in arabidopsis, camalexin biosynthesis is mis-regulated in wrky <dig> mutant
 <cit> . over-expression in arabidopsis of panax quinquefolius wrky <dig>  a jasmonate responsive wrky from american ginseng, is found to enhance expression of genes related to drought, salt, and disease resistance, leading to improvement of seedling survival to drought and salt stress, in addition to regulating the expression of genes related to triterpene biosynthesis
 <cit> . in catharanthus, crwrky <dig> has been demonstrated to respond to jasmonate, ethylene, and gibberellin signaling to regulate tia production
 <cit> . over-expression of crwrky <dig> increased the production of serpentine while simultaneously decreasing catharanthine accumulation, suggesting this wrky may function in governing gene expression that specifically directs the flow of metabolites to synthesize tias in catharanthus roots.

identification of jasmonate responsive wrky will thus provide useful information on plant defense and natural product regulatory networks. understanding the number and types of wrky tfs present in catharanthus will provide a clearer picture on the regulation of tias by this important tf family. here, we present jasmonate responsive wrkys from arabidopsis and catharanthus. first, we analyzed arabidopsis microarray data to help identify the involvement of the wrky tfs in jasmonate signaling. we then used the medicinal plant transcriptome data to identify the catharanthus family of wrky tfs. expression data from catharanthus revealed the induction of multiple wrky transcripts by methyl jasmonate  treatment. seventy-five percent of the jasmonate responsive crwrkys are orthologs of atwrkys known to be regulated by jasmonate. meja-induced wrkys provide potential candidates for further regulation of tia accumulation in catharanthus. the identification of orthologs for wrky tfs known to be involved in specialized metabolism in other plant species indicates the possible involvement of additional wrky tfs in regulation of tia production in catharanthus.

RESULTS
wrky tfs are involved in jasmonate signaling
the role of wrky tf family in sa signaling and plant defense is well established and has been systematically analyzed in arabidopsis, but remains less clear for jasmonate signaling. jasmonate is a key phytohormone regulating the production of specialized metabolites in many plant species, including catharanthus. while arabidopsis does not synthesize tias as found in catharanthus, studying atwrkys can answer several important questions. first we wanted to determine whether the wrky family is important for regulating jasmonate signaling in a model species, such as arabidopsis. second, we wanted to elucidate jasmonate responsive atwrkys to aid the identification of crwrky orthologs with potentially conserved regulatory functions. comparison of orthologous jasmonate responsive wrkys from arabidopsis and catharanthus will identify wrkys that are potentially involved in modulating jasmonate signaling, and in turn identify candidates that regulate tia production.

to clearly establish the role of wrky tfs in jasmonate signaling we first identified jasmonate responsive wrkys in the model plant arabidopsis. to ascertain jasmonate responsive arabidopsis wrky tfs we used publically available microarray datasets . the ath <dig> affymetrix arrays used contain probes identifying 85%  of arabidopsis wrky tfs . from five datasets, we identified  <dig> atwrky tfs that significantly change in response to jasmonate treatment . of the  <dig> jasmonate responsive atwrky genes,  <dig> were differentially expressed in at least two jasmonate treated datasets. atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  and atwrky <dig> were differentially expressed in three jasmonate treated datasets. expression of atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> were significantly changed in response to jasmonate in four datasets. atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> expression were significantly changed in all five datasets. notably, atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  and atwrky <dig> expression were significantly differentially regulated to jasmonate treatment in four or more microarray experiments, but did not survive application of the benjamini-hochberg false discovery  in any dataset. arabidopsis wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  and wrky <dig>  which have known roles in jasmonate signaling, were identified as being differentially expressed, but did not survive the b-h fdr in any dataset . while the b-h fdr is less conservative than other procedures , genes on the upper end of significant p-values  may not be easily detected even if the response is consistent. this becomes apparent by the large reduction in significant genes after b-h fdr . in total, eleven wrkys survived the b-h fdr in at least one dataset indicating these are jasmonate responsive. we identified five wrky tfs previously reported to be jasmonate responsive
 <cit> . additionally, we identified at least six arabidopsis wrky tfs  previously unreported to have a role in jasmonate response . expression of atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  and atwrky <dig> changed significantly and survived the b-h fdr in two datasets. for these eleven atwrkys, the change in expression in response to jasmonate treatment was small, around  <dig>  fold . atwrky <dig> displayed the greatest change in expression, with a 9-fold induction of transcripts after 1 hr of treatment with meja. collectively, at least 18% of atwrky , up to 64%  or more, were jasmonate responsive wrkys based on the microarrays analyzed. overall, at least 30%  of atwrky tfs play a role in jasmonate response indicating the importance of this family in the jasmonate signaling network. further experiments may eventually reveal that upwards of 50%  of wrkys are involved in arabidopsis jasmonate response .table  <dig> 
the arabidopsis wrky transcription factors differentially expressed in response to jasmonate treatment in five experiments before and after the application of the benjamini-hochberg false discovery rate


analysis was performed using a two-way anova. only wrky genes responsive to jasmonate treatment are presented.



the small overlap between wrky genes differentially expressed in response to jasmonate treatment in the microarray experiments suggested a tight developmental and/or spatiotemporal regulation in arabidopsis. two-way anovas analyzing expression in response to time, as well as its combined effect with jasmonate treatment, further indicated atwrky regulation is temporally dependent . the expression of  <dig> atwrky genes was time dependent . jasmonate treatment was found to regulate the expression of atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> in a time dependent manner. the genetic background of jasmonate signaling pathway mutants had less effect on wrky gene expression. coronatine insensitive  <dig>  has been established as a jasmonate receptor
 <cit> . atwrky <dig> was the only wrky family member found to be regulated in a coi1-dependent manner when the b-h fdr was applied . no wrkys were found to be dependent on myc <dig> , a major transcriptional regulator of jasmonate signaling
 <cit> . these results indicate that response of arabidopsis wrky tfs to jasmonate treatment is highly dependent upon tissue, timing and culture conditions, and likely occurs through several major pathways. furthermore, wrky tfs may be important coi1-independent regulators of jasmonate response.

unsupervised agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis of atwrky tfs was performed to identify similar patterns of gene expression which may indicate related functions
 <cit> . gene expression of atwrkys formed two major clusters. clustering of experiments revealed more similarities within an experiment than by jasmonate treatment . additionally, the two major clusters separated those experiments in which the sampled tissues were from either plants or cell cultures. these findings further support atwrky gene expression in response to jasmonate as highly dependent on culture conditions and environment. the two major clusters were further subdivided into two or three clusters. jasmonate responsive wrkys previously annotated or identified by our microarray analysis primarily occurred in cluster one and all of the three sub-clusters. the distribution of jasmonate responsive atwrkys indicates at least two major pathways for the regulation of atwrky gene expression. interestingly, the only wrky identified by microarray analysis to be coi1-depenedent, atwrky <dig>  occurred in cluster 2b, distinct from expression patterns of other jasmonate responsive wrkys. these data further suggest that there are complex tissue and environmental controls over jasmonate responses that likely occurs through several major pathways. these findings from arabidopsis provide foundational information about the involvement of wrky tfs in jasmonate response and for exploiting these factors in genetic engineering of transcriptional regulatory networks for natural product production.

identification of catharanthuswrky tfs
previously we identified a meja responsive group iii type wrky tf, crwrky <dig>  as important for the regulation of tia in catharanthus
 <cit> . furthermore, the arabidopsis data indicates the atwrky family as important for regulating jasmonate response. jasmonate responsive crwrky tf may be important for regulating the production of valuable tias. elucidation of crwrkys regulating specialized metabolite production will be valuable for future genetic engineering projects to increase production of pharmaceutically valuable tias. as the first step to identify important crwrky regulators of specialized metabolism we sought to identify all wrky family members in catharanthus. the recent release of  <dig> medicinal plants illumina sequenced transcriptomes by the medicinal plant genomic resource , including catharanthus, provides the opportunity to identify many crwrky tfs
 <cit> . to identify crwrkys, we first downloaded all protein sequences from mpgr and isolated a single protein sequence for each locus. we assumed the individual copy of each locus reflects the total number of functional genes within the genome. while this method may include potential errors, such as rna-sequencing artifacts, establishing single copies of genes allows the identification of wrky family members and approximate family size. due to possible variations in splicing and/or incomplete splicing of introns we searched contig assemblies with the longest predicted protein sequence for each gene in the mpgr database. all crwrky proteins identified from the mpgr database, described below, were manually verified to contain a wrky domain. in several cases , alignment results among catharanthus contigs for a locus and the closest matching atwrky tf, were utilized to remove a conserved intron following the wrkygqk consensus sequence or correct a frame shift, to generate a full wkry domain sequence. as single base pair insertion in crwrky <dig> was not clear by aligning other copies of this contig, the region spanning the insertion was cloned for verification.

searching for the established invariant consensus sequences wrkygqk and known alternative wrkygkk, wrkygek, and wrkygsk consensus sequences from the list of proteins, duplicate results were eliminated and  <dig> putative wrky tfs were identified . comparatively, mpgr annotated  <dig> potential crwrky tf encoding genes. however, only  <dig> wrkys overlapped between manual searches for the consensus motifs and the mpgr annotated datasets.

to further validate the number of wrky tfs a list of the single longest predicted proteins for each locus was submitted to the national center for biotechnology information conserved domain database  and the samuel roberts nobel foundation planttfcat  server, for protein domain identification
 <cit> . the ncbi cdd identified  <dig> wrky domain-containing proteins . similarly, planttfcat  also identified  <dig> wrky domain-containing proteins. the majority of additional proteins identified by ncbi cdd and planttfcat as wrky tfs, had incomplete n-terminal ends of the wrky domain . one additional predicted wrky tf, crwrky <dig>  contained a wrkygrk motif. crwrky <dig>  which was identified by ncbi cdd, but not planttfcat, had an incomplete c-terminal portion of the wrky domain. contig cra <dig> was predicted by planttfcat to be a wrky tf. inspection of this protein sequence did not reveal the presence of a wrky consensus or zinc finger binding motif. of the  <dig> proteins annotated as wrkys by mpgr, only  <dig> were found to be true wrky tfs as identified by ncbi cdd and planttfcat. in total,  <dig> proteins in catharanthus were predicted as wrky tfs .table  <dig> 
a list of catharanthus wrky domain containing proteins along with locus number and group number are presented




of the  <dig> possible wrky tfs from catharanthus, at least  <dig> appear to be authentic . the mpgr database contained full wrky domain sequences for  <dig> domains from  <dig> tfs. partial domain sequences were found for nine wrkys. 3′ rapid amplification of cdna ends  or 5′ race was performed to obtain the necessary domain sequence for  <dig> wrkys. 3′ race was performed on crwrky <dig>  for crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  and crwrky <dig>  5′ race was used to obtain the rest of the wrky domain sequence. clones could not be found for four genes . expression data, available from mpgr, revealed these four wrkys are not present in any of the  <dig> samples sequenced. to validate the mpgr expression data, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  was used to measure the transcript levels of crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  and crwrky <dig>  gene specific transcripts for crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  and crwrky <dig> could not be detected in root, stem, leaf, or whole plant samples. transcripts for the same four wrkys could also not be found in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 4 hour meja-treated samples. this data suggests that these predicted partial wrky sequences are not in any of our samples, and that they may be either artifacts of rna-sequencing, temporally regulated, or induced by a factor not present in our growing conditions. wrky tfs are known to play key roles in plant senescence
 <cit> . however, senescing medicinal plant tissues were not utilized for sequencing in the mpgr. inclusion of senescing tissues may slightly increase the total wrky number to more closely reflect fully sequenced plant species. future investigations with different treatment conditions may detect the expression of crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  and crwrky <dig> 

the catharanthus wrky family appears to be one of the smallest reported wrky tf families to date. only the moss physcomitrella patens, the lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii, and castor bean , with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> wrkys respectively, are reported to have fewer wrky tfs
 <cit> –
 <cit> . our results suggest that the catharanthus wrky family is similar in size to cucumis sativus, fragaria vesca, jatropha curcas, and carica papaya with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> wrkys, respectively
 <cit> –
 <cit> . to further investigate the size of the catharanthus wrky family, we identified the wrky tfs from serpentwood  transcriptome sequences 
 <cit> . serpentwood is closely related to catharanthus and also produces pharmaceutically valuable tias . we found  <dig> serpentwood tfs, a number close to the  <dig> wrkys identified in catharanthus. the number of wrkys belonging to each subgroup was also similar between these two species . however, as both serpentwood and catharanthus wrkys were identified from transcriptome data, the actual size of the families may be larger. to address this possibility, we identified wrky families from tomato 
 <cit> , potato 
 <cit> , pepper 
 <cit> , and bladderwort 
 <cit> , all species of which have complete genome sequence available . we identified  <dig> wrky tfs in tomato , as previously reported
 <cit> . bladderwort, pepper, and potato each contained  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> complete wrky tfs, respectively . these data suggest the ancestor of the gentianales , lamiales , and solanales  likely contained around  <dig> wrky tfs. therefore, we conclude that greater than 75%  of catharanthus and serpentwood wrky tfs were identified from transcriptome data. together, the six asterid species contained a similar number of wrky tfs as found in the brassicales, arabidopsis and papaya
 <cit> . these data, combined with that from other wrky families
 <cit> –
 <cit> , suggests that brachypodium distachyon , oryza sativa ssp. japonica , populus trichocarpa , and zea mays  may contain atypically large wrky families
 <cit>  compared to other angiosperms. arabidopsis and rice both contain expansions in the group iii wrky subfamily
 <cit> , whereas an expansion of group iie occurs in potato and tomato
 <cit>  . we did not find any evidence for subfamily expansions in catharanthus or serpentwood .table  <dig>

 was constructed using the neighbor-joining method with p-distance substitution model, pairwise-deletion, and a bootstrap value of  <dig>  wrky domain alignment was performed with clustalw. proteins used as an outgroup are indicated by a teal triangle. wrky tfs from six additional medicinal species, a. annua , c. japonica , g. arboreum , h. brasiliensis , p. quinquefolius , and t. chinensis , were included. wrky tfs involved in regulating secondary metabolism are indicated with a black dot.



phylogenetic analysis of catharanthuswrky tfs
to determine the relationship among catharanthus wrky tfs, a phylogenetic tree was constructed with  <dig> wrky domains from  <dig> tfs from catharanthus, amborella trichopoda, arabidopsis and rice  . wrky sequences from chlamydomonas reinhardtii , dictyostelium discoideum , and giardia lamblia  were included as an outgroup. additional, outgroup sequences include human gcma  and flywch craa . we used  <dig> and  <dig> wrky domains from  <dig> and  <dig> tfs, from arabidopsis and rice respectively, to construct the phylogenetic tree. thirty-five domains from  <dig> amborella wrky tfs were also included in the phylogenetic analysis
 <cit> . we incorporated the wrky sequences of amborella, an evolutionary basal angiosperm, to reduce long-branch attractions during phylogenetic tree construction. amborella was selected over physcomitrella patens  and selaginella moellendorffii  since the wrky sequences from this phylogenetically important species remains unreported yet provides valuable insights about wrky evolution. the phylogenetic tree contained  <dig> domains from  <dig> crwrky tfs . to ascertain potential functions, we compared catharanthus and arabidopsis wrky tfs by identifying orthologs. we identified  <dig> group i,  <dig> group ii, and five group iii wrky tfs in catharanthus. group ii wrky tfs can be classified into groups iia, iib, iic, iid, or iie
 <cit> . in catharanthus, we identified three group iia, five group iib, thirteen group iic, four group iid and seven group iie wrky tfs.

evolutionarily, group i wrky tfs, such as those found in algae, are some of the most ancient of wrkys
 <cit> . recent evidence suggest that the group i wrkys, and other wrky tfs, originated from an ancestral group iic-like domain
 <cit> . as previously reported for this group, ten group i crwrkys contained two wrky domains with the n-terminal domain forming a separate clade and the c-terminal wrky domains forming part of the group iic clade
 <cit> . to identify orthologs and paralogs in amborella, arabidopsis, catharanthus and rice, we used orthomcl
 <cit> . we found catharanthus contains six coorthologs  to atwrky <dig> . according to the phylogenetic tree, crwrky <dig> is most closely related to atwrky <dig> .table  <dig>

wrkys in ‘bold font’ are jasmonate responsive, either according to the literature or by our findings in this study. wrky highlighted in italics are tfs known to regulate secondary metabolism in a. thaliana, artemisia annua, c. rosues, coptis japonica, gossypium arboreum, hevea brasiliensis, panax quinquefolius, and taxus chinensis.



group iia was the only group of wrkys that had similar numbers between catharanthus and arabidopsis. rice had four group iia wrky tfs whereas both arabidopsis and catharanthus each contained three. the three group iia wrkys from catharanthus are coorthologs to atwrky <dig> .

previous reports indicate some plants contain variants of the highly conserved wrkygqk domain, such as wrkygkk, wrkygek, wrkygsk, among others
 <cit> . variation in this region can reduce, eliminate, or alter dna binding activity
 <cit> . wrky tfs with variants of the consensus sequence may recognize different cis-elements. we found atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  and atwrky <dig> belong to the group iic wrky subfamily and possess a wrkygkk motif as previously reported
 <cit> . two crwrkys were identified that contain variants of the highly conserved wrkygqk motif. crwrky <dig> and crwrky <dig> contain wrkygkk and wrkygrk sequence motifs, respectively. mutagenesis of the conserved glutamine was previously demonstrated to reduce, but not eliminate, dna binding
 <cit> . more recently, atwrky <dig> was found to generally bind the gac core of the w-box with less preference for 5′ or 3′ bases
 <cit> . therefore, both wrkygkk and wrkygrk variants are expected to still bind dna. nictotiana tabacum wrky <dig>  containing a wrkygkk motif, has been found to bind the wk-box cis-element , but not the w-box, which regulates expression of the plant defense gene pathogenesis related1
 <cit> . however, capsicum annuum wrky <dig>  a wrkygkk motif wrky tf involved in plant defense, can still recognize the w-box
 <cit> . the phylogeny and protein alignment of the dna-binding wrky domains of crwrky <dig>  cawrky <dig> and ntwrky <dig> revealed more similarity of crwrky <dig> to cawrky <dig> , suggesting that despite the variant wrkygkk motif, crwrky <dig> likely still recognizes the w-box element or at least the gac core. although hordeum vulgare wrky <dig>  contains a wrkygqk motif, hvwrky <dig> recognizes the sugar responsive  and w-box cis-elements to regulate barley genes involved in starch metabolism
 <cit> . this leaves open the possibility that some catharanthus wrky tfs may not recognize w-box cis-elements.figure  <dig>

group iii wrky tfs are believed to have dramatically expanded during the evolution of angiosperms and can be classified into different subgroups depending on the species
 <cit> . arabidopsis contains fourteen group iii wrky tfs which are further divided into eight group iiia and six group iiib. in arabidopsis, most group iii wrky transcription are induced by plant pathogens
 <cit> . we identified only five group iii wrky tfs in catharanthus. similarly, we identified  <dig> group iii wrkys in serpentwood and bladderwort . proportionally, the number of group iii crwrky tfs is the smallest compared to arabidopsis. the low number of group iii crwrkys, and similar number from serpentwood and bladderwort, suggests this group has not undergone significant expansion such as occurred in rice or arabidopsis
 <cit> . crwrky <dig> and crwrky <dig> were found to be coorthologs to atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> . atwrky <dig> modulates sa and jasmonate signaling
 <cit> . interestingly, crwrky <dig> differentially directs the flow of unknown precursors into tia products
 <cit> , a feature possibly governed by its jasmonate responsive gene expression. crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  and crwrky <dig> are coortholgs of atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  and atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> are partially functionally redundant in regulating plant defense
 <cit> .

we previously reported the role of crwrky <dig> in regulating gene expression and tia accumulation in catharanthus
 <cit> . crwrky <dig> is a group iii wrky with overall protein sequence homology closest to atwrky <dig>  and corresponds to mpgr contig number cra <dig>  phylogenetically, crwrky <dig> is located towards the base of the group iii clade and does not clearly group with its arabidopsis or rice orthologs . to identify the unique feature of crwrky <dig>  we analyzed the protein sequence alignment. the invariant tryptophan starting the wrkygqk motif was used as the reference point for comparing alignments. alignment of crwrky <dig> to other group iii wrky tfs revealed that crwrky <dig> lacks an amino acid between the two conserved cysteine residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> . the closest rice wrky tfs, oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig>  all have altered spacing within the wrky domain sequence. oswrky <dig> possesses an additional proline residue between the wrkygqk sequence and the conserved arginine residue at position 16
 <cit> . the conserved arginine at position  <dig> was changed to threonine followed by a tqs motif in oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig> contains an extra ddp sequence between positions  <dig> and  <dig> compared to all other arabidopsis, rice, and catharanthus group iii wrky tfs. the altered spacing in the wrky domain may give these wrky tfs unique structural properties important for target gene regulation.

expression profiling reveals multiple jasmonate responsive crwrkys
mpgr provides rna-sequencing based expression data from different tissues for all sequenced medicinal plants. for catharanthus, rna-sequencing data is also available for different tissues, seedlings, cell suspension cultures, and hairy root cultures. these data provide an opportunity to understand the induction of wrky genes in response to conditions that induce the tia pathway. furthermore, several treatments allow for comparison of induction to the same hormone in varying tissues. in response to meja, a potent and important elicitor of natural product formation, including tias, in catharanthus and other medicinal species
 <cit> –
 <cit> , mpgr expression data indicates multiple wrky tfs are either up or down regulated in catharanthus.

to identify or validate wrky tfs that are up- or down regulated by meja, we performed qrt-pcr on whole plant samples  that were collected from one month old soil grown plants at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 4 hours after meja treatment. successful induction with meja was verified by measuring jaz <dig> expression . to determine which wrky tfs were possible regulators of tia production, we sought to measure the expression of multiple pathway genes such as g10h, tdc, and str . these genes were selected to represent early  and middle portions  of the tia pathway. any wrky induced prior or simultaneously to these genes possibly could regulate that corresponding portion of the pathway and any subsequent segments.figure  <dig>

plants. three whole plants were combined for each biological replicate. each time point consisted of three biological replicates. three technical replicates were measured per time point sample. a. expression of catharanthus jaz <dig> transcripts were determined in after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or 4 hours of meja treatment. b. expression of the tia biosynthetic genes g10h, tdc, and str. c-d. expression of  <dig> catharanthus wrky transcription factors in response to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 4 hours of meja treatment. significant and highly significant, p-value <  <dig>  or  <dig>  respectively, changes in gene expression were determined using a student’s t-test.



we selected at least two genes from each crwrky subgroup. four genes  were selected based on involvement of their orthologs in regulating secondary metabolism genes in other species. analysis of sixteen crwrkys identified twelve which displayed significant changes in expression in response to jasmonate . the fold change for most crwrkys with a significant response to meja was  <dig> fold or less , similar to our microarray findings for jasmonate responsive arabidopsis wrkys . crwrky <dig> was up-regulated 1 hour after meja treatment then decreased by 4 hours after treatment. crwrky <dig> was down-regulated significantly at both  <dig> and 4 hour after meja treatment. crwrky <dig>  similar to the aba responsive atwrky <dig>  was significantly up-regulated  <dig> and 2 hours after meja treatment. crwrky <dig> was up-regulated by 2 hours after meja treatment. crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  and crwrky <dig> were all significantly down-regulated at all time points after meja treatment. two wrkys, crwrky <dig> and crwrky <dig>  had a bimodal expression pattern that was down-regulated at  <dig> and 4 hours, but not 2 hours, after meja treatment. a bimodal expression pattern has been observed for some regulators of the tia pathway
 <cit> . crwrky <dig> was down-regulated  <dig> and 4 hours after treatment. nine of  <dig> crwrkys analyzed were down-regulated to meja treatment. in total at least 25% , and probably more, of crwrky tfs are regulated by jasmonate. of the twelve jasmonate responsive crwrkys, nine have an atwrkys ortholog which were either previously reported and/or identified here by microarray analysis  as differentially regulated by jasmonate . when compared to the less stringent list of atwrkys which had expression significantly changed  in response to jasmonate, but did not survive the b-h fdr, all twelve crwrkys have orthologs to jasmonate responsive atwrkys.

to identify potential wrkys regulating tia biosynthesis through the jasmonate signaling pathway, we compared the induction times of wrky genes  to early and mid- biosynthetic genes of the pathway . similar to previous reports in cell cultures
 <cit> , induction of str by meja began approximately 2 hours after treatment. however, expression of g10h decreased starting at 1 hour after meja treatment, and was further down-regulated 4 hours after treatment . tdc transcript levels remained unchanged to meja treatment in mature catharanthus plants. prior reports of tdc
 <cit> –
 <cit>  and g10h
 <cit> –
 <cit>  transcript induction by jasmonate treatment was identified in seedlings, hairy roots, or cell cultures; however, our experiments were performed in intact mature catharanthus plants. expressions of wrky tfs possibly contributing to tia regulation are predicted to be altered before early and mid steps of the tia pathway. expression of crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig> and crwrky <dig> changed by 1 hour after meja treatment indicating these wrkys could possibly regulate the expression of early tia pathway genes. altered expression of all twelve crwrkys responding to meja occurred by 2 hours after treatment, the same time at which significant induction of str occurred. contrary to tdc and g10h, which contain four and one w-boxes in their promoters respectively
 <cit> , the characterized str promoter does not contain any w-box elements for wrkys to bind, but this does not exclude the possibility that wrky regulate other tfs controlling str expression. the spatio-temporal regulation of crwrkys, by reducing tdc responsiveness and down-regulating g10h, is one possible reason why mature catharanthus plants do not accumulate tia in response to jasmonate treatment
 <cit> . these findings suggest that all crwrkys we ascertained as differentially expressed in response to jasmonate are possible regulators of early and middle steps of tia biosynthesis. presumably, these crwrky could also regulate downstream steps of the pathways which are temporally expressed later.

the jasmonate response of catharanthuswrky varies among plant culture conditions
we sought to determine the similarities between our qrt-pcr results and the transcriptome data published by mpgr. as we used one month-old plants to quantify gene expression, and no data on meja treated mature plants are provided by mpgr, we correlated our data to three different datasets each representing one aspect of our samples . seedlings treated with meja most closely represent our samples in physiology as both are whole plant tissues; however, the mpgr dataset used seedlings rather than mature plants, which may respond to meja differently
 <cit> . while cell cultures are considerably different in physiology from whole plants, the earliest time sample  was closest to our sample times of  <dig>   <dig>  and 4 hours after meja treatment. hairy root cultures require several weeks to develop to sufficient size; therefore, the age of this tissue most likely represents a similar age as our plant samples, despite our shorter meja treatment time. the pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to measure the relationship between the datasets. crwrky <dig> and crwrky <dig> were excluded from the correlations as they appear two times in the mpgr datasets without expression values. the correlation between mpgr seedling and cell culture datasets, as well as between cell culture and hairy root datasets, was quite low , indicating considerable difference in crwrky response to meja in cell culture systems. however, there was a high correlation between seedling and hairy root mpgr datasets  for meja treated crwrky genes. our qrt-pcr data showed that the correlations ranged from  <dig> , between 1 hour meja treated plants and 24 hour meja treated hairy roots, to  <dig> , between 1 hour meja treated plants and 6 hour meja treated cell suspension cultures . overall, the three mpgr datasets correlated well with all three time points of qrt-pcr data  indicating similar expression changes in response to jasmonate treatment. increasing time after meja treatment in whole plants increased the correlation with seedling and hairy root cultures. cell cultures, despite higher similarities in the 4 hour meja treated plant and 6 hour meja treated cell culture time frame, showed a lower correlation between the 1 hour meja treated plant and 6 hour meja treated cell cultures. similar to arabidopsis, these findings in catharanthus suggest significant differences exist between jasmonate response in various cultural conditions, including intact seedlings, adult plants, cell cultures, and hairy root cultures.figure  <dig> 
pearson correlation analysis of wrky expression data and hierarchical clustering of mpgr transcriptome data for the crwrky tf family. a. pearson correlation between fold change of qrt-pcr expression and mpgr datasets for meja treated samples. fold change for both sets was calculated using the reference gene ef1α as an internal control. b. hierarchical cluster analysis of mpgr transcriptome data for the crwrky tf family was performed using genepattern. the clustering method was a pairwise average linkage with distance measured using the pearson correlation coefficient. data was log transformed. the median value was subtracted from each row. color is based on global expression with purple being up-regulated and green down-regulated.



gene expression clusters often contain genes with related functions
 <cit> , including those in natural product formation
 <cit> . recently, clustering of mpgr expression data has aided the identification of catharanthus iridoid synthase
 <cit> . to identify potential clusters of crwrky tfs with similar expression pattern which may indicate wrky functions, we performed a hierarchical clustering. unsupervised agglomerative hierarchical clustering of  <dig> transcriptome gene expression datasets from mpgr revealed three primary clusters: a plant tissue cluster, a hairy root cluster, and a protoplast cluster . clusters of plant culture type indicate a greater difference between cultural conditions than between meja treatment. however, clear differences exist between meja treated and untreated samples within subgroups of each primary cluster. clustering of crwrky gene expression revealed three primary clusters. crwrkys of cluster one were most up-regulated in different plant tissues, suggesting a role in plant development. the second cluster of wrky genes is up-regulated in hairy root cultures. members of cluster two may be important for regulating metabolism and resource direction into primarily root produced alkaloids, such as ajmalicine and serpentine. identification of crwrky <dig>  which plays a role in serpentine production, in cluster two supports this idea. crwrky <dig>  ortholog to aawrky <dig>  a trichome expressed wrky in artemisia annua, was also found in this cluster. crwrky <dig> and crwrky <dig> orthologous to pqwrky <dig> which is suggested to regulate terpene biosynthesis in panax quinquefolius  roots also occur in this cluster. the third cluster consisted of crwrky that were up-regulated in response to meja or yeast extract , an elicitor of tia biosynthesis, in protoplasts. most of this cluster was also up-regulated in hairy root cultures. most crwrkys orthologous to wrkys regulating natural product formation in other species were identified in this cluster. importantly, four crwrkys , similar to those with known roles in secondary metabolism , were identified as part of the same sub-cluster in cluster three. the four members of this cluster may play key roles in regulation of natural product formation in catharanthus. a second sub-cluster of cluster three, composed of six members, contained five crwrkys  which are orthologs to wrky tfs regulating natural products in other species. the sixth member of this sub-cluster, crwrky <dig>  is also a jasmonate responsive wrky. members of this sub-cluster may also be important for regulation of natural products in catharanthus. crwrky tfs, determined by qrt-pcr to be meja responsive, were distributed across all three clusters, indicating jasmonate broadly regulates wrkys from each cluster.

predicted role of crwrky orthologs in secondary metabolism
catharanthus produces alkaloids, terpenes and latex, all classes of compounds that contain biosynthetic genes involved in their production which have been implicated to be regulated by wrky tfs in other species
 <cit> . to associate biosynthesis of natural compounds with jasmonate-responsive crwrkys, we compared catharanthus wrky tfs to those known to control secondary metabolism in other plant species . cjwrky <dig> is involved in the regulation of the benzylisoquinoline alkaloid berberine
 <cit> . in catharanthus, crwrky <dig> grouped closely with cjwrky <dig> . the ortholog of cjwrky <dig> in arabidopsis is atwrky <dig> 

atwrky <dig> plays a role in regulating biosynthesis of camalexin, an indole ring and n-containing defense molecule, and functions downstream of mitogen-activate protein kinase  <dig> and 6
 <cit> . recently, crmpk <dig> was shown to regulate tia accumulation
 <cit> . as catharanthus produces over  <dig> different tia metabolites, the multiple coorthologs to atwrky <dig> may be important for regulating diverse products of this pathway. however, further experiments are needed to demonstrate whether the orthologous tfs in catharanthus act downstream of crmpk <dig> and are involved in tia biosynthesis. interestingly, cmwrky <dig>  from chlamydomonas, was also an ortholog to atwrky <dig>  suggesting a possible early function of this tf in defense and regulating secondary metabolism.

aawrky <dig>  which is involved in regulating the accumulation of artemisinin, has three coortholgs in catharanthus, crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  and crwrky <dig> . in arabidopsis three group iiia wrkys, atwkry <dig>  atwrky <dig>  and atwrky <dig> are coortholgs to aawrky <dig>  in catharanthus, increased production of hmgr and terpenes have negatives effect on the accumulation of certain tias
 <cit> . in a. annua, aawrky <dig> affects the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase 
 <cit> , a rate limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. both aawrky <dig> and crwrky <dig> are jasmonate responsive genes; therefore, at least crwrky <dig> may have an evolutionarily conserved function in regulating the flux of carbon into catharanthus terpenes.

the rate limiting enzyme in the production of paclitaxel, dbat, is regulated by tcwrky1
 <cit> . phylogenetically, tcwrky <dig> is basal to the group iia and iib clades . catharanthus crwrky <dig> and crwrky <dig> were identified as coorthologs to tcwrky <dig> . in arabidopsis, the group iib atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  and atwrky <dig> were found to be coortholgs to tcwrky <dig> .

gawrky <dig>  from cotton, regulates a sesquiterpene cyclase leading to the production of gossypol
 <cit> . atwrky <dig> was found to be the arabidopsis ortholog to gawrky <dig> . atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> formed their own ortholog group independent of atwrky <dig>  catharanthus, however, contains three coortholgs to gawrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  and crwrky <dig>  as with atwrky <dig>  these crwrkys may have a role in negative regulation of aba response
 <cit>  and positive regulation of jasmonate responses
 <cit> . supporting this idea, like atwrky <dig> and gawrky <dig>  we found expression of crwrky <dig> was induced by jasmonate treatment. drought, salinity, and cold all affect tia accumulation in catharanthus
 <cit> , thus at least crwrky <dig> may function in regulating the accumulation of tias in response to abiotic stress and plant defense.

hbwkry <dig> expression is related to latex production in rubber trees
 <cit> . in catharanthus, crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  and crwrky <dig> are coorthologs to hbwrky <dig>  six coothrologs  to hbwrky <dig> exist in arabidopsis . like hbwrky <dig>  at least four arabidopsis  and two catharanthus wrkys  are regulated by jasmonate. phylogenetically, the group iic atwrky <dig> and crwrky <dig> are the wrkys most similar to hbwrky <dig> in arabidopsis and catharanthus, respectively . as catharanthus also produces a latex compound, the jasmonate regulated crwrky <dig> or one of the other paralogs, may function in the regulation of latex or terpene production in catharanthus.

heterologous over-expression, in arabidopsis, of the meja responsive american ginseng wrky tf, pqwrky <dig>  increased drought and salt stress tolerance, in addition to regulating terpene biosynthetic genes
 <cit> . atwrky <dig> in arabidopsis and crwrky <dig> and crwrky <dig> in catharanthus are orthologs to pqwrky <dig> . contrary to the report by sun et al.
 <cit> , which classifies pqwrky <dig> as a group iic wrky, we found pqwrky <dig> actually falls within the iid subgroup when compared to the entire arabidopsis wrky family . atwrky <dig>  crwrky <dig>  and pqwrky <dig> are each regulated by jasmonate supporting the possible conserved evolutionary function of these proteins in regulating terpene biosynthesis.

kalde et al.
 <cit>  reported a role of most arabidopsis group iii wrky tfs in plant defense. overall, no clear trend was observed for wrky tfs possibly involved in secondary metabolism belonging to a specific group or subgroup. further work is needed to verify the predicted roles of these crwrkys in the regulation of secondary metabolism.

comparative genetics across species has provided invaluable information that lead to the isolation and functional understanding of several key regulators in natural product formation. in arabidopsis, the bhlh factor atmyc <dig> is known as a central regulator of jasmonate signaling pathway. the orthologs of atmyc <dig>  crmyc <dig> and ntmyc <dig>  from catharanthus and tobacco, respectively, have thus been isolated and characterized. while arabidopsis does not produce tias or nicotine, crmyc <dig> and ntmyc <dig> act in the jasmonte signaling pathway to regulate biosynthesis of these metabolites
 <cit> . moreover, atmyc <dig> can bind the jasmonate-responsive elements present in the promoter of catharanthus orca <dig>  an ap2/efr tf gene, and activates its expression, illustrating the conserved nature of these orthologous regulators
 <cit> . these reports further strengthen our reasoning for cross-species comparison of wrky tfs from catharanthus, arabidopsis, and other medicinal plant to identify regulators conserved in jasmonate response and possibly secondary metabolite production.

comparison of crwrkys with orthologs from other species, that are known to regulate natural products or respond to jasmonate treatment, helped us develop a model for wrky regulation of tia biosynthesis in catharanthus . in this model, jasmonate acts as a central regulator of the tia pathway with both positive and negative effects on wrkys. phytohormones, including aba, ethylene and gibberellin , are also likely involved in crwrkys regulation. overall, this work provides a fundamental base for which future experiments can be designed to help elucidate the molecular mechanisms controlling the biosynthesis of highly valuable tias.figure  <dig> 
a model of wrky tfs function in
catharanthus
based on expression data and known roles in
a. thaliana. the model depicts crwrkys which were either similar to a wrky with a known role in regulating natural product formation in another species or had transcript level differentially expressed in response to meja treatment. jasmonate has both positive and negative effects on crwrky transcript accumulation which is possibly important for fine-tuning tia and terpene biosynthetic gene expression. the hormones abscisic acid , ethylene, and gibberellin  also are likely important for regulation of catharanthus wrkys. solid lines depict known regulations and dashed lines indicate hypothetical regulatory interactions.



CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our results illustrate a role for the arabidopsis wrky family in regulating jasmonate response. these findings strengthened our reasoning for investigating catharanthus jasmonate responsive wrky tf which are potentially involved in regulation of tia biosynthesis. results from arabidopsis and catharanthus suggest that the regulation of wrky gene expression in response to jasmonate is dependent upon environmental and spatio-temporal context. such information can be important in designing metabolic engineering projects. furthermore, we identified numerous jasmonate responsive orthologs between atwrky and crwrky tfs that may be functionally conserved or partially conserved. the jasmonate responsive crwrkys are potential candidate tfs for having key roles in modulating jasmonate signaling and regulating tia biosynthesis. information on how atwrkys response to various phytohormones and stresses may also apply to catharanthus. this information may be useful for understanding how other phytohormones also contribute to the regulation of tia production. moreover, elucidation of crwrky functions may provide valuable insights into the regulation of natural product biosynthesis in other medicinal plants.
