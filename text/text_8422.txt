BACKGROUND
fatty liver is a major metabolic disorder of transition dairy cows affecting approximately half of the herd immediately after calving  <cit> . it is commonly associated with reduced productivity, fertility and immune functions, and may even lead to liver failure and premature death  <cit> . almost all high-producing dairy cows are in negative energy balance in early lactation, as energy requirements exceed feed consumption capacity  <cit> . therefore, fatty liver mainly occurs in the first 4 weeks after calving  <cit> , when the hepatic uptake of lipids exceeds the oxidation and secretion of lipids by the liver. as compared with other species, the bovine liver is inefficient at exporting triglyceride  in very low-density lipoprotein   <cit> . this state leads to tg accumulation in the liver, resulting in impaired hepatic metabolism  <cit> . although, cows with mild and moderate fatty liver do not necessarily show clinical signs, the condition has been associated with health and production problems  <cit> . despite the economic importance of this disease, it is often misidentified or overlooked due to difficulties in diagnosis  <cit> .

paraoxonase- <dig>  is a mammalian enzyme synthesized exclusively in the liver and secreted into the blood  <cit> . it has been shown that pon <dig> is able to hydrolyze specific oxidized lipids  <cit> , leading to a reduction in oxidative stress in serum lipoproteins, macrophages and atherosclerotic lesions  <cit> . two possible substrates for bovine pon <dig> are commonly used. the ability of pon <dig> to hydrolyze paraoxon was employed as a method for measuring paraoxonase activity. pon <dig> also shows arylesterase activity, with phenyl acetate being one of its best substrates  <cit> . moreover, in humans and several experimental studies, pon <dig> has shown good lactonase activity, hydrolyzing a wide range of lactones  <cit> .

as compared with the substantial information available on pon <dig> from human and experimental animals’ studies, little is known about its roles in cows  <cit> . as the liver plays a key role in the synthesis of serum pon <dig>  it is plausible that there is an association between serum pon <dig> activity and liver impairment during fatty liver development in dairy cows.

standard biochemical tests for liver dysfunction are insufficiently sensitive for a reliable diagnosis of fatty liver in dairy cows; thus, histological examination of liver biopsy for determining fat contents has become the definitive means of diagnosing fatty liver  <cit> , but this is an invasive and costly procedure, making it poorly suited for dairy farms. therefore, finding a sensitive and noninvasive measurement for diagnosis of fatty liver is important for greater profitability in the dairy industry. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic power of serum pon <dig> activity, alone and in combination with standard liver function tests, in the diagnosis of fatty liver in dairy cows.

methods
animals and serum sampling
the study population included  <dig> non-pregnant clinically healthy holstein-friesian dairy cows  and  <dig> non-pregnant holstein-friesian dairy cows  suffering from fatty liver. all cows were within 4 weeks postpartum. all healthy cows were confirmed by physical, serum biochemical and hematological examinations. with regard to selection of cows with fatty liver, three crucial aspects must be considered: exclusion of cases with any other pathological conditions such as fever, abomasal displacement, mastitis, metritis, vaginal discharge, and bone fractures; confirmation of fatty liver cases was performed by postmortem examination by expert slaughter house inspectors; and none of the fatty liver cases suffered from recumbency before slaughter. all cows were kept on the same farm on kyushu island, japan. blood samples were collected from each cow before feeding in the morning from the jugular vein into vacutainer®  tubes with potassium edta  and without anticoagulant . tubes were placed in an icebox and carried to the laboratory within less than 1 h of collection. after clotting for 2 h on ice, samples were centrifuged at 1600× g for 15 min. farm owner gave informed consent for cows to be included in the study and undergo the testing procedures. the laboratory protocols were performed in compliance with the institutional review board for animal experiments of the university of miyazaki.

hematological parameters measurement
hematological variables including white blood cells  and red blood cells , hemoglobin  concentration, hematocrit  value, mean corpuscular volume , mean corpuscular hemoglobin , and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration  were determined using an electronic particle hematology analyzer .

biochemical parameters assay
the following parameters were assayed: serum aspartate aminotransferase , gamma glutamyltranspeptidase  and alkaline phosphatase    <cit> ; non-esterified fatty acids  ; β-hydroxybutyrate  ; and triglyceride , total cholesterol , high-density lipoprotein , free cholesterol  and phospholipids  ; total protein , albumin , total bilirubin , glucose , blood urea nitrogen , calcium , phosphorus , and magnesium    <cit> . low-density lipoprotein  was calculated using the friedewald equation  <cit> , and vldl was calculated using the following formula: triglyceride/ <dig>  <cit> . cholesteryl ester  was calculated as t.chol minus fc and ester  ratio was calculated by dividing ce value by t.chol value. albumin/globulin  ratio was calculated by dividing albumin value by the globulin value.

pon <dig> activities measurement
serum pon <dig> activity was assayed using three synthetic substrates: paraoxon ; and dihydrocoumarin ; phenyl acetate   <cit> . briefly, pon <dig> activity against paraoxon was determined based on the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis to p-nitrophenol by monitoring the absorbance at 412 nm for serum samples in 100 mm tris–hcl buffer containing 2 mm paraoxon and 2 mm cacl <dig> . enzyme activity was calculated from e <dig> of p-nitrophenol  and expressed in terms of u/ml , while the enzyme activities toward dihydrocoumarin and phenyl acetate were determined by measuring the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis within the assay mixture containing serum samples in 100 mm tris–hcl buffer containing 2 mm substrates, and 2 mm cacl <dig> in . absorbance was monitored for dihydrocoumarin and phenyl acetate at 270 nm and enzyme activity was calculated from the e <dig> of dihydrocoumarin  and phenyl acetate . enzyme activities were expressed in u/ml . all activities were measured at 25°c.

lcat activity assay
serum lcat activity was assayed using the calbiochem fluorometric lcat assay kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions with some modifications. briefly, aliquots  of serum in both control and fatty liver cases were incubated at 37°c with the fluorescently labeled cholesterol in assay buffer containing 150 mm nacl, 10 mm tris–hcl, 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm edta at ph  <dig> . total assay volume was 45 μl. after 8 h of incubation at 37°c, 30 μl of the reaction mixture was added to  <dig> μl of the read reagent . conversion of cholesterol  to cholesteryl ester  at 340 nm excitation was determined in a fluorescence microplate reader . the change in ratio of the two intensities  was then calculated.

statistical analysis
we used shapirowilks test to examine whether variables were distributed normally. following data distribution, differences between study groups were tested by using independent samples t-test and mann–whitney u test. correlation coefficients were calculated by spearman’s method. partial correlation coefficients were calculated among selected blood variables, corrected for animal groups. diagnostic accuracy for serum pon <dig> and other biochemical tests was calculated with receiver operating characteristic  curve analysis  <cit> . logistic regression was used to estimate the ability of groups of variables to predict the presence or absence of liver disease. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value , negative predictive value , positive likelihood ratio , and negative likelihood ratio  were computed with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals . we also calculated the diagnostic odds ratio  which expresses the strength of the association between the test result and disease  <cit> . statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software package spss for windows . statistical significance between mean values was set at p <  <dig> . data are reported as means and standard deviations .

RESULTS
clinical signs
no clinical signs were observed in the control group at the time of sample collection. on the other hand, the diseased cases showed decreased appetite, rough fur, weak ruminal movement, loss of abdominal circumference, decreased milk yield, rapid deterioration of body conditions and sometimes watery diarrhea.

biochemical and hematological parameters

other biochemical parameters supported the presence of fatty liver, as manifested by significant increases in ast , nefa , bhba , total bilirubin   and tg . fatty liver cases also showed significant decreases in lcat , t.chol , hdl , vldl , ldl , fc , ce , pl , e. ratio , alb  and a/g ratio . in addition, significant hypocalcemia  and hypomagnesmia  were associated with fatty liver cases. there were non-significant changes in the concentrations of total protein, glucose, blood urea nitrogen and phosphorus.

for hematology parameters, cases with fatty liver showed a significant  decrease in the number of rbcs, as well as significant  increases in the volume of rbcs and hemoglobin content, as indicated by increased mcv and mch, leading to a state of macrocytic anemia.

diagnostic performance was evaluated by roc analysis with pertinent areas under the curve . aucs with the corresponding cut-off and p values are listed in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  curves for paraoxonase, lactonase, arylesterase, ast, alp and lcat appear in figure  <dig>  the aucs for pon <dig>  activity were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, which were higher than those of other liver enzymes . nefa, bhba, total cholesterol, hdl, ldl and phospholipids showed aucs of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively .

in order to further illustrate the correlation coefficients of the regression lines between serum pon <dig> activity and the other biochemical analytes, spearman and partial correlation coefficients are depicted in table  <dig> below and above the diagonal, respectively. spearman correlation  showed significant correlations between paraoxonase activity and indicators of liver damage or dysfunction , with indicators of fat mobilization , as well as significant correlations with indicators of hepatic synthesis and metabolic abilities  support the notion that pon <dig> activity is a good reflection of hepatic function. notably, the three activities of pon <dig>  in dairy cow showed significant positive correlations  with one another. on the other hand, when the animal health conditions were controlled, partial correlation coefficients , showed that there are no correlations between paraoxonase and the indicators of liver damage and fat mobilization . we can infer that the relationship between pon <dig> activity and liver damage or dysfunction biomarkers is mediated by fatty liver.

all correlations shown are significant .

the usefulness of adding serum pon <dig> measurement to the biochemical panel of liver function tests was analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis. this showed that adding pon <dig> values to other biochemical results increases the sensitivity, specificity, ppv, npv and likelihood ratios , as well as overall diagnostic accuracy. the optimum diagnostic cut off point maximizing the sensitivity and specificity was determined to be  <dig>  u/ml for paraoxonase activity, with a sensitivity of  <dig> % and specificity of  <dig> %. the corresponding ppv and npv levels were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. adding pon measurement to other biochemical parameters improves the diagnostic indices by increasing +lr, decreasing -ldr, and greatly increasing dor. as shown in table  <dig>  the best performance was observed with a combination of paraoxonase and nefa measurements, and paraoxonase, nefa, bhba, ast, lcat and total cholesterol.

discussion
the liver plays a pivotal role during the transition period of dairy cows, and its functions are necessary for successful adaptation without the occurrence of health disorders  <cit> . therefore, finding suitable noninvasive tests for improving the evaluation of liver function and aiding in diagnosis of fatty liver is urgently necessary.

there are no standardized methods for measuring pon <dig> esterase activity. the most widely used method is the hydrolysis of paraoxon. however, this method is not free of drawbacks. firstly, paraoxon is very unstable and extremely toxic, which is not suitable for a high-throughput routine method. secondly, the interpretation of the physiological significance of a measurement conducted with such an unnatural substrates is questionable. in addition, the enzyme’s activity on paraoxon is strongly influenced by the pon <dig> genetic polymorphism   <cit> . recent significant advances in the search for reliable pon <dig> lactonase activity assays may facilitate the measurement in a routine clinical chemistry laboratory setting  <cit> . this study is the first to measure lactonase activity in bovine samples, which makes pon <dig> measurement closer to practical development in veterinary field. in the present study, we found that serum pon <dig>  activity is significantly reduced in cows with fatty liver, as compared with controls. several mechanisms may explain this decrease in serum pon <dig> activity. first, pon <dig> activity may be decreased as a result of altered pon <dig> synthesis by the liver  <cit> , possibly due to increased hepatic and serum proinflammatory cytokine  in cows with fatty liver  <cit> . second, reductions in serum pon <dig> activity in fatty liver cases might be attributed to changes in hdl structure and composition  <cit> , and this is supported by our findings of decreased lcat activity in fatty liver cases, which is in accordance with the results of nakagawa et al.,   <cit> . both pon <dig> and lcat are hdl-associated proteins. accordingly, the reduction in serum pon <dig> and lcat activities appears to be mediated by alterations in hdl structure and concentration, which may be primarily caused by fatty liver  <cit> . finally, cows with fatty liver showed increased free radical production manifested by high levels of malondialdehyde  <cit> , and pon <dig> is known to be inactivated after hydrolysis of lipid peroxides  <cit> .

in normal dairy cows, lipid accumulates in the liver chiefly in the form of triglycerides, this accumulation reaches up to  <dig> times the normal value in cows suffering from fatty liver  <cit> . it is conceivable that this accumulation of triglycerides in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes causes disturbances in hepatic structure and function  <cit> . enzyme leakage from hepatocytes is one manifestation of these disturbances. serum ast increases significantly in accordance with serious hepatic damage induced by fatty accumulation  <cit> . this is supported by significant positive correlations between ast and nefa  and bhba . although ast activity is relatively high and in similar amounts in liver and in skeletal and cardiac muscle, suggesting that it is not liver specific  <cit> , but its diagnostic sensitivity is reported to be 94% for fatty liver in dairy cows with a strong correlation between serum activity and liver triglyceride content  <cit> . on the other hand, ggt is almost entirely associated with the biliary epithelium in the liver and is consequently not released into circulation until bile damage occurs. it seems likely that fat infiltration, during fatty liver development in our study, does not induce either cholestasis or bile duct damage, as no significant correlations were observed between ggt and other biochemical parameters. this is supported by non-significant changes in serum alp concentration instead of the expected increases. taken together, the results for ggt and alp values indicate that fat infiltration in the liver does not induce intraluminal pressure leading to intrahepatic obstruction of the bile ducts. we also found significant hyperbilirubinemia in the fatty liver group, which suggests liver damage caused by increased unconjugated bilirubin  <cit> . the higher bilirubin levels observed in fatty liver group could be also explained with a lower liver synthesis of the enzymes necessary to remove bilirubin from the blood; these enzymes could be also considered as negative acute phase proteins  <cit> .

we found a significant increase in the concentration of serum nefa levels. elevated nefa concentrations are a common factor in the induction of fatty liver, reflecting excessive mobilization of body fat to cope with the high energy demand of milk synthesis. under such conditions, which are associated with marked formation of acetyl coenzyme a, the tricarboxylic acid cycle cannot fully metabolize fatty acids. as a result, acetyl coenzyme a is converted to acetoacetate, which is then reduced to bhba by bhb dehydrogenase or spontaneously decarboxylized to acetone  <cit> . this explains our observation of a significant increase in the concentration of bhba in fatty liver cases. this increase in bhba concentration is known to precede and be associated with the development of fatty liver  <cit> .

as the liver occupies a central position in bovine metabolism, fatty liver is accompanied by disturbances in hepatic structure and function  <cit> ; therefore, cows with fatty liver may also show abnormal lipid and lipoprotein concentrations  <cit> . in our study, cows with fatty liver showed a significant decrease in total cholesterol, which was inversely related to nefa concentrations. these results are in accordance with previous reports  <cit> . the decrease in serum hdl may have resulted from impaired hepatic secretion of apolipoprotein a, the basic protein for the synthesis of hdl, that is considered a negative acute phase protein, and thus the reduction in hdl could be caused by an inflammatory condition  <cit>  and may be related to the lower cholesterol levels seen in cows with fatty liver, as hdl consists of about 60% cholesterol  <cit> .

we also found a significant decrease in vldl in the fatty liver group, as compared with healthy cows. several previous studies have noted that the accumulation of fat in the liver cells and development of fatty liver is caused by reduced synthesis of vldl  <cit> . decreased vldl secretion and decreased conversion to ldl explains our findings of decreased serum ldl levels in cows with fatty liver. another possible reason for the decreased ldl levels is the increased rate of ldl catabolism  <cit> . the decreased concentrations of phospholipids  and free cholesterol  observed in cows with fatty liver may be a consequence of reduced lcat activity  <cit> . the decrease in ce concentration also appeared to be attributable, at least in part, to the decreased lcat activity and other enzymes responsible for cholesterol synthesis, such as hydroxymethylglutaryl -coa reductase  <cit> . an unexpected clinicopathological observation in our study was the significant increase, instead of the expected decrease, in plasma triglyceride concentrations in cows with fatty liver when compared with the control group. although this observation is supported by the work of basoglu et al.,   <cit> , it requires further investigation.

we found a significant hypoalbuminemia in fatty liver cases as a result of decreased volume of rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial damage  <cit>  induced by fat infiltration of hepatic tissue. in addition, albumin is a negative acute phase protein and extensive inflammation may compound this hypoalbuminemia  <cit> . moreover, low a/g ratio in the presence of normal total protein indicates elevated globulins in response to acute inflammation  <cit> .

serum glucose concentration was not significantly different between healthy and fatty liver cases. this finding may be due to insulin resistance, which commonly accompanies fatty liver in dairy cows  <cit> . this finding is in accordance with the results of kalaitzakis et al.   <cit> .

despite the importance of histopathological examination of hepatic tissue, japanese regulations prevented us from doing this in the present study. however, in our study we have confirmed the presence of fatty liver by postmortem examination which considered, regardless the degree of fatty liver, as a strong evidence for its presence in diseased animals. postmortem examination of cows with fatty liver revealed swelling of the hepatic parenchyma, which increased the size and the volume of the organ  <cit> . additionally, from the practical point of view, lipid profile disturbances and lcat activity are useful serum biomarkers for diagnosis of fatty liver in cows  <cit>  that enable us to confirm the diagnosis of fatty liver cases in our study. however, the lack of postmortem examinations on the control cows is a limitation of the study. acknowledging such limitation of our study, future investigations are required to assess the correlation between serum pon <dig> activity and hepatic triglycerides in both healthy and diseased cows.

severe fatty liver does not always result in measurable hepatic dysfunction. due to the apparent variability in the usefulness of biopsy in determining the severity and/or diagnosis of clinical disease  <cit> , a “battery” of tests needs to be performed to increase the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis. among the direct biomarkers of fatty liver, we found good diagnostic performance for nefa, bhba, ast and lipid profile. these biomarkers showed excellent predictive value for diagnosis of fatty liver. notably, addition of serum pon <dig> to these biochemical tests gave a combination of high sensitivity, specificity, ppv, npv, +lr, –lr, dor and overall diagnostic accuracy in diagnosing fatty liver . the auc-roc of pon <dig> activity for the detection of fatty liver was more than 98% accurate, which has not been achieved through other diagnostic algorithms.

importantly, from an economic point of view, the combined measurement of pon <dig> activity and nefa concentration would be useful for diagnosing cows with fatty liver as it provides sensitivity, specificity, ppv, npv, +lr, -lr, dor and overall diagnostic accuracy comparable to that produced by the combination of nefa, bhba, ast, lcat, total cholesterol, and pon <dig>  moreover, the strong correlations between serum pon <dig> and ast, lcat, total bilirubin, nefa, bhba and lipid profile make serum pon <dig> measurement advantageous in diagnosis of fatty liver .

it is noteworthy that the measurement of serum pon <dig> activity is a simple, reliable, fast, inexpensive, readily automated method that is compatible with random access analysis in barcoded primary tubes, and can be performed with most automated analyzers used in standard biochemical liver function tests  <cit> . the only drawback, the use of the toxic substrate paraoxon, can be overcome using the nontoxic lactonase activity, as our results  showed a good correlation between paraoxonase and lactonase activity in bovine serum.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study demonstrates that addition of serum pon <dig> activity measurement to the biochemical profile could improve the diagnosis of fatty liver in dairy cows. future studies in this area should focus on the correlation between serum pon <dig> activity and hepatic triglycerides content in both healthy and ill dairy cows as well as the diagnostic validation of serum pon <dig> assay in the early prediction of fatty liver development in dairy farms, which would have a considerable clinical impact and lead to greater profitability in the dairy industry.
