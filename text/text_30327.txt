BACKGROUND
concerns about global warming in combination with increased use of fossil fuel have spurred growing interest in sources of renewable energy such as biofuels. the genus miscanthus has been considered attractive as a feedstock for cellulosic biofuel production because the plants are adapted to temperate latitudes yet utilize the energy-efficient c <dig> photosynthetic pathway, producing high yields of biomass but with low-nutrient requirements, adaptation to marginal land due to resistance to abiotic stress, and not competing with use for food  <cit> . at present,  <dig> miscanthus species are recognized, most of which are native to eastern asia, but with a few found in polynesia, the himalayas, and southern africa  <cit> .

miscanthus belongs to the andropogoneae tribe of grasses, including many economically important crops such as maize, sorghum, and sugarcane. in particular, miscanthus and sugarcane belong to the subtribe saccharinae that may be characterized by its complex and high ploidy genomes. for example, m. × giganteus , which is specifically of interest due to its ability to accumulate biomass, is thought to result from crosses between m. sacchariflorus  and m. sinensis   <cit> . study of the large and complex miscanthus genomes is challenging, although the whole genome sequence of closely-related sorghum   <cit>  provides a valuable reference for molecular research in miscanthus. genomic study of miscanthus is currently focused on the construction of genetic maps using aflp  <cit> , ssr  <cit> , rna-seq  <cit> , and gbs   <cit> .

expressed sequence tags  are frequently useful for plant species that do not have sufficient genomics resources, providing functional profiles of genes as well as a basis of evolutionary study. owing to massively parallel sequencing technologies, large numbers of ests can be easily generated under different growing conditions or tissue types; however, only five miscanthus ests are publicly available in the ncbi’s dbest as of december,  <dig> .

in the current study, we generated transcriptome data sets from m. sacchariflorus and m. sinensis, the suspected progenitors of the m. × giganteus species which is preferred for biomass production. in particular, we chose those two species to scan transcriptomes because they will be served as mapping parents and the collection of gene profile may be necessary in the future work. we determined functional profiles of transcriptome sets from both leaf and rhizome for each miscanthus species and compared the profiles. m. sinensis is known to have weak  rhizomes but m. sacchariflorus has vigorous rhizomes, so it was of interest to identify genes showing significantly different expression in rhizomes than other tissues  <cit> . in addition, using the massive transcriptome data, we estimated the time of divergence among the two miscanthus species, sorghum and saccharum.

RESULTS
 <dig> sequencing and de novo assembly of miscanthus est
in m. sinensis, a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads from leaf and rhizome cdna libraries were generated, spanning about  <dig> mega base pairs  and  <dig> mbps, respectively. the numbers of reads from the leaf  and rhizome  libraries in m. sacchariflorus were slightly less than those in m. sinensis; however, the average read length was longer than in m. sinensis . after the assembly of raw reads , the leaf  and rhizome  cdna libraries of m. sinensis generated a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs, respectively. the leaf  and rhizome  libraries in m. sacchariflorus have  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs, respectively. it is no surprise that the number of reads is positively correlated with that of contigs. the average numbers of reads in a contig are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for msil, msir, msal, and msar, respectively. the length distribution of the contigs is shown in figure  <dig>  the assembly produced a substantial number of large contigs in m. sinensis . likewise,  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs were assembled to more than 200 bp in msal and msar, respectively. the average contig lengths were  <dig>  and 993 bp  while the average singleton lengths were  <dig>  and 303 bp . the genome-wide coverage of unigenes based on the size of the haploid genome of m. sinensis and m. sacchariflorus <cit>  was about  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, while the estimated coverage of coding sequences in sorghum was  <dig> %  <cit> . however, genome size is not consistent with the number of genes . the haploid genome size of miscanthus spp. is about three times bigger than that of sorghum, in part due to the whole genome duplication event after its divergence from the sorghum lineage  <cit> ; thus, simple comparison of coding sequences to each genome may not be able to explain the coverage of our ests to total transcriptomes in miscanthus. for example, a total of  <dig>   and  <dig>   unigenes  have significant similarities to sorghum gene models   <cit>  based on blast search , indicating that the number of miscanthus ests presented in this study is sufficient for further analysis.

functional annotation of ests
in order to assign putative functions to ests, only contigs were subjected to similarity searches because short singletons could yield false positive results. first, contigs were blasted against all the genome sequences in major biological databases such as phytozome  <cit>  and kog   <cit>  with a cutoff e-value of 10- <dig> . a total of 93%  of the total msil contigs and 81%  of the total msir contigs matched phytozome transcripts from one or more of twenty-five plant species, while 94% of msal and msar contigs had significant hits. contigs from rhizomes had relatively fewer matches  than those from leaves, consistent with limited sequence information available from rhizomatous plants and limited knowledge of rhizome-specific gene functions. next, we blasted the contigs against the kog in order to determine conserved orthologous genes. msil and msir contigs had 56% and 54% significant hits against the kog versus 58% and 55% for msal and msar, respectively. m. sacchariflorus shows higher proportions than m. sinensis because of the smaller number of contigs. in addition, since the kog for plant genes was constructed solely based on arabidopsis thaliana, the ~40% of contigs which do not have significant matches to genes in the db may reflect monocot-dicot divergence or lineage- or species-specific genes.

more than 50% of transcripts were specific to either leaf or rhizome libraries. highly similar leaf and rhizome contigs were determined by blastn  to calculate proportions of genes expressed in both organs . in m. sinensis,  <dig>  genes were expressed in both leaf and rhizome, comprising  <dig> % and  <dig> % of msil and msir, respectively. in m. sacchariflorus,  <dig>  contigs were expressed in both tissues comprising  <dig> % and  <dig> % of msal  and msar , respectively.

more than  <dig> % of transcripts were specific to m. sinensis or m. sacchariflorus libraries. the leaf libraries of the two miscanthus species had  <dig>  highly similar contigs which was  <dig> % in msil and  <dig> % in msal whereas the rhizome libraries had the  <dig>  contigs whose proportion in msir and msar were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the relatively higher proportions of highly similar contigs between m. sacchariflorus and sinensis in m. sacchariflorus than in m. sinensis libraries might be caused by less number of contigs in m. sacchariflorus and that is consistent with the higher proportion of well conserved orthologous genes in m. sacchariflorus library than m. sinensis .

a total of  <dig>  transcripts were found to be expressed in all tissue types and species. as expected, go classification suggested that those transcripts were mostly related to basal plant metabolic processes or structures. although a large number of transcripts seem to be tissue- or species-specific genes as shown in this work, housekeeping functions appear well conserved in different tissues and species.

comparative analysis of rhizome-enriched genes of sorghum spp. to miscanthus ests
previously, rhizome-enriched genes have been identified from s. halepense and s. propinquum <cit> . similarity search showed that  <dig> out of  <dig> rhizome-enriched genes found in the two sorghum species have at least one ortholog in miscanthus ests and  <dig> have orthologs in both leaf and rhizome from the two miscanthus species. the  <dig> rhizome-enriched genes with four corresponding orthologs in miscanthus  were defined as orthologous groups and a phylogenetic tree was generated for each orthologous group. since m. sinensis is known to have weak or no rhizomes whereas m. sacchariflorus has vigorous rhizomes, only three types of trees clustering rhizome-enriched genes of the two sorghum species and rhizome ests of m. sacchariflorus  were further analyzed although  <dig> different topologies were generated. interestingly, no tree topology showed clustering of rhizome-enriched genes from the two sorghum species and rhizome ests of m. sinensis, suggesting that rhizome-enriched genes from the two sorghum species are more similar to the rhizome ests of m. sacchariflorus. the three topologies comprised  <dig> orthologous groups. table  <dig> shows ests included in the  <dig> orthologous groups with their putative functions. the genes included in those three topologies were annotated by gene ontology . while no particular category was predominant, the ‘response to stimulus’ , seemingly related to signals in response to stress, occupies a high portion. jang et al. <cit>  suggested that the loss of rhizomatousness in s. bicolor might have been caused by changes in gene regulation. although the  <dig> genes are not specifically associated with functions and go categories found in roots or rhizomes, these genes could be primary targets for investigating rhizomatousness in miscanthus. the  <dig> genes are all expressed in both leaf and rhizome in the two miscanthus species, but rhizome ests of m. sacchariflorus are still closer to rhizome-enriched genes from the two sorghum species, which could be caused by regulatory changes in the upstream regions of those genes. however, there are a number of ests exclusively expressed in miscanthus rhizomes . it remains to be determined whether they are truly specific to rhizomes or due to inadequate sampling in random sequencing of transcriptomes.

speciation of miscanthus spp., sugarcane, and sorghum
synonymous nucleotide substitution  of orthologous gene pairs provided insight into the timing of divergence among these grasses . considering  <dig>  × 10- <dig> synonymous changes per synonymous site per year as the neutral mutation rate in monocots  <cit> , the divergence of sorghinae and saccharinae subtribes  was  <dig> , corresponding to  <dig>  million years ago . divergence between saccharum and miscanthus genera  was estimated as  <dig>  mya; and between the two miscanthus species  as  <dig>  mya.

the divergence between sugarcane and sorghum has previously been investigated using orthology, with multiple studies estimating that the two species diverged about  <dig>  -  <dig>  mya  <cit> . since miscanthus and sugarcane belong to the same subtribe  and share a common ancestor, the estimation may be consistent with the case which sorghum and miscanthus are compared; however, our estimation in was about  <dig>  -  <dig>  million years more recent . the discrepancy from previous reports may be due to different sequence data used for the comparison. kim et al. <cit>  and wang et al. <cit>  estimated the divergence time at  <dig>  mya but jannoo et al. <cit>  reported the divergence time at  <dig>  -  <dig>  mya. the former two studies used sugarcane ests mostly originating from hybrid sugarcane cultivar but the latter used only a single gene, adh <dig>  to estimate the divergence between the two subtribes. the sugarcane genome is more complex than miscanthus owing to a higher ploidy number and hybrid sugarcane is still more complex because of its interspecific origin and frequent aneuploidy caused by its breeding history  <cit> . therefore, although the common ancestor of miscanthus and sugarcane diverged from the sorghum lineage at the same time, hybrid sugarcane could be highly polymorphic within single cultivars, and appear more diverged from sorghum than miscanthus, resulting in the overestimation of ks values. we also infer that sugarcane and miscanthus share a common ancestor about  <dig>  mya. due to lack of nucleotide information in miscanthus, its divergence from the saccharum lineage had not been estimated previously  <cit> . in turn, the estimation of the two genera could be overestimated because of the ests from hybrid sugarcane cultivar. however, our estimation together with est sequences may serve as a guideline for future research in the evolution of miscanthus species until a detail of sugarcane genome is released.

recently published genetic maps revealed that the miscanthus lineage experienced whole genome duplication after its divergence from sorghum  <cit> . although we tried to find paralogs from the est datasets to date the duplication, signals were mostly hidden or too weak. finding recent whole genome duplication events using ests is somewhat difficult in that paralogous and redundant sequences are not clearly identifiable in est datasets and recent whole genome duplication signals are frequently masked by recent single gene duplication signals. if the whole genome duplication occurred in miscanthus after its divergence from a common ancestor shared with sorghum , two hypotheses are highly likely:  the miscanthus genome had experienced some ‘diploidization’  before the two miscanthus species diverged , and  the  m. sinensis genome experienced appreciable diploidization after the two miscanthus species diverged. if the former is true, m. sacchariflorus might have had an additional genome-wide duplication after the two species diverged. considering the recent divergence of the two species , the latter may be more plausible. however, this has to be elucidated with additional information.

functional differentiation of miscanthus and sorghum genes
conserved protein domains are frequently essential to the function of a gene. amino acid change that occurs in the conserved regions of a protein sequence is more likely to have larger impact on gene function than changes in other regions  <cit> . the impacts of nssnps on gene functions were predicted based on gene conservation profiles as described by paterson et al. <cit> . a total of  <dig>  nssnps were identified between miscanthus and sorghum and  <dig>  nssnps between msa and msi. if a base involved in a specific nssnp site is predominant in the  <dig> published genomes , the base is defined as a common allele. otherwise, it was defined as a rare allele. in figure  <dig>  the x-axis indicates the impact on gene function. if an nssnp is changed from a common to a rare allele, it has positive value. therefore, the impact of nssnps on gene function increases from negative to positive values. the y-axis represents the probability of nssnps with different impact. the impacts on gene function of snps that differ between the two miscanthus species are significantly more positive than snps between sorghum and miscanthus , indicating that striking mutations are more frequently found between two miscanthus species than sorghum and miscanthus. this may be a consequence of the much higher level of gene duplication in miscanthus, in which striking mutations may be better tolerated by virtue of the presence of a second gene copy that may confer essential functionality.

table  <dig> shows the ten largest-effect nssnps that are found between reference  and mutated alleles . the ten genes could be classified into five functional categories which are abc transporters, glycogen synthase kinase- <dig>  atpase, beta tubulin, and cellulose synthase. interestingly, except for cellulose synthase , three functions  and beta tubulin have very close go terms, atp binding  and gtp binding , respectively. these genes may be of interest for further functional investigation.

reference  and mutation amino acid  indicate sorghum allele and mutated allele in miscanthus, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study provides nearly  <dig>  ests and  <dig>  ests from m. sinensis and m. sacchariflorus, respectively, greatly enriching knowledge of the transcriptome of this promising lignocellulosic bioethanol crop. m. sinensis and m. sacchariflorus are of particular interest because they are suspected progenitors of the triploid m. × giganteus which is cultivated as a biomass crop. these ests can be utilized in many ways such as seeking molecular markers, gene prediction in genome sequences, and gene expression studies. a core set of  genes are expressed in common in the two miscanthus species and the two tissues studied, with large populations of genes that appear to be tissue specific. genes showing rhizome-enriched expression in rhizomatous sorghum species appear to correspond more closely to those in m. sacchariflorus which has aggressive rhizomes, than those in m. sinensis that has weak rhizomes. the analysis of nssnps showed that striking mutations are more frequently found between two miscanthus species than between miscanthus and sorghum, reflect that miscanthus seems to be more tolerant of point mutations than sorghum. a plausible explanation of this observation is that genomic redundancy resulting from its recent genome doubling has relaxed selection on duplicated gene copies. we also analyzed ests to make preliminary inferences about miscanthus evolution. as stated in the text, miscanthus experienced whole genome duplication since its divergence from sorghum. although ests generally provided too little information to clearly identify paralogs which were formed by the whole genome duplication, they were still useful to predict speciation events by providing clear signal of orthologous relationships. the exact timing of the whole-genome duplication event can be evaluated when additional genome sequence and detailed maps are available, and our ests will be able to contribute to such detailed evolutionary studies.
