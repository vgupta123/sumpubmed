BACKGROUND
sperm interaction with the extracellular matrix surrounding the oocyte, the zona pellucida , is a key step in mammalian fertilisation. the structure and function of the zp were first studied in mice in the 1980s  <cit> . mouse zp contains three glycoproteins: zp <dig>  zp <dig> and zp <dig>  zp <dig> binds to primary receptors on capacitated spermatozoa, inducing a cascade of intraspermatic events including the biphasic calcium influx leading to the acrosome reaction . following the ar, spermatozoa remain bound to the zp via zp2; they then penetrate the zp and fuse with the egg plasma membrane  <cit> . the fertilisation is followed by the fusion of peripheral cortical granules with the vitelline membrane, resulting in the discharge of the contents of these granules into the perivitelline space. this exocytosis modifies the zp matrix such that sperm no longer bind to or penetrate zp, preventing polyspermy.

our understanding at a molecular level of gamete interaction in humans is much more restricted than for mice and other mammalian species, due to the small number of oocytes available which limits the number of feasible studies. in humans, only a few studies with recombinant human zp <dig>  have been carried out, mainly on the ar and its regulation by ions  <cit> . moreover, the probable structural differences between natural zp and rhzp <dig> – particularly in terms of the carbohydrate moieties which play an important role in the recognition and binding of the zp by sperm  <cit>  – raise some doubt as to whether rhzp precisely mimics natural hzp in its action. therefore some data obtained in mice have been extrapolated to humans. however, studies of genes encoding zp proteins led to the recent discovery of a fourth zona glycoprotein in humans; this protein is not present in mice but is found in other mammalian species  <cit> . this fourth zona glycoprotein, zp <dig>  plays a structural role and is also involved, together with zp <dig>  in sperm binding and ar induction  <cit> . the identification of this fourth glycoprotein raises the possibility that classical model of sperm-zp interaction established in mice may not apply to species producing zp <dig>  the functions of the zp should therefore be re-evaluated in such species.

the aim of our study was to analyse the functions of human zp  from fertilised and unfertilised oocytes, obtained from an in vitro fertilisation  program, during their interaction with spermatozoa. we investigated the capacity of hzp to bind spermatozoa, to induce calcium signalling and the ar. we analysed in detail the intracellular calcium signalling induced by the hzp as most of the knowledge of this zp-induced transduction pathway comes from studies carried out in cattle and mice  <cit>  we also assessed the penetration of hzp by spermatozoa, as a means of evaluating hzp function during secondary binding.

RESULTS
biochemical characterisation of zp collected from unfertilised and fertilised human oocytes
in addition to morphological criteria, biochemical analyses on the zp was performed to categorise the oocytes as "fertilised" or "unfertilised". as proteolysis of zp <dig> is a known biochemical modification of the zp occurring after the fertilisation, we determined by western blotting the cleavage status of zp <dig> in zp isolated from the unfertilised and fertilised oocytes used in our work . in unfertilised embryos, the anti-rhzp <dig> antibody detected the zp <dig> as a major band at  <dig> kda , which disappeared almost totally in fertilised oocytes and was essentially replaced by two bands of  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda . this result indicates that our hzp preparations were suitable to represent a fertilised and unfertilised human oocyte/egg material.

sperm binding to intact hzp from fertilised and unfertilised human oocytes
after  <dig> h hours of gamete co-incubation, the zonae pellucidae of all inseminated oocytes, whether fertilised or not, were able to bind spermatozoa . the number of spermatozoa bound by intact zp varied from  <dig> to  <dig> for unfertilised and from  <dig> to  <dig> for fertilised oocytes. however, the mean number of spermatozoa bound per fertilised oocyte was significantly lower compared to unfertilised oocyte .

ability of solubilised zp from fertilised and unfertilised human oocytes to induce calcium influx into capacitated spermatozoa
description and quantification of the hzp-induced ca2+ influx
regardless of the origin of the hzp, we analysed sperm calcium response to hzp in all the experiments . the addition of solubilised hzp  to the capacitated human sperm samples induced  <dig> types of intraspermatic increase in ca2+ concentration. in  <dig> of the  <dig> samples, solubilised hzp induced a biphasic ca2+ influx consisting of a transient peak followed by a sustained increase in  above basal levels called pattern i . in pattern i, the transient peak lasted  <dig> to  <dig> s and corresponded to an increase in calcium concentration of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm . in pattern i, the second sustained influx of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm ca2+ stabilised at a level below  or above  the initial peak,  <dig> to  <dig> min after the addition of hzp. no significant influx was observed in control experiments . in the other nine experiments, hzp induced only a sustained calcium influx called pattern ii , similar to the second phase of pattern i. in pattern ii, the maximal level was reached rapidly  in four experiments  and more slowly  in the other five experiments . in the pattern ii, mean i during the sustained phase was also significantly higher than in the controls, reaching values similar to those observed in the sustained phase of pattern i .

involvement of a voltage-dependent channel in the increase in calcium concentration induced by solubilised human zona pellucida
in the absence of external ca2+, the addition of hzp did not induce an influx of ca2+ . the effect of pimozide, which efficiently blocks ca2+ currents induced by solubilised zp in mouse spermatozoa when added at the start of capacitation  <cit> , was investigated on the calcium response to solubilised hzp. the incubation of sperm samples with  <dig> μm pimozide from the start of capacitation resulted in  <dig>  ±  <dig> % inhibition of the solubilised hzp-stimulated ca2+ peak and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % inhibition of the sustained phase .

ability of zp from fertilised and unfertilised human oocytes to induce ar in capacitated spermatozoa
induction of the acrosome reaction by solubilised zp
when spermatozoa were incubated with hzp there was a significantly higher proportion of ar than in the absence of hzp . the mean percentage of zp-induced ar did not differ significantly between the sperm populations displaying pattern i and ii increases in calcium levels . no correlation was found between zpiar  and basal calcium level , hzp-induced calcium peak  or sustained calcium phase .

the mean ar rate induced by solubilised zp from fertilised oocytes differed significantly from the spontaneous ar rate  but not from that induced by solubilised hzp from unfertilised oocytes .

induction of the acrosome reaction by intact zp
in  <dig> independent experiments, we found that most of the spermatozoa bound to intact zona had undergone the ar, whether the oocytes were fertilised or unfertilised. after a three-hour co-incubation period, the mean rate of the ar in spermatozoa bound to fertilised oocytes was significantly higher than that of free-swimming spermatozoa in the medium  but did not differ from that induced by zp from unfertilised oocytes . after  <dig> h of co-incubation, the frequency of the ar had increased slightly in zona-bound spermatozoa but remained similar in unfertilised and fertilised oocytes .

sperm penetration in intact human zona pellucida from fertilised and unfertilised oocytes
the mean number of embedded spermatozoa was significantly higher after co-incubation of spermatozoa with unfertilised intact hzp compared to fertilised hzp . the penetration rate  was significantly higher for unfertilised than for fertilised oocytes  in each of the  <dig> experiments. the overall penetration rate for unfertilised and fertilised oocytes was 57% and 19%, respectively.

discussion
most of our knowledge about the events occurring during gamete interaction has come from studies carried out in mice. a model rapidly emerged, with each of the three zona glycoproteins having a precise function. zp <dig> was thought to be purely structural, with dimers creating bridges between filaments composed of a succession of zp <dig> and zp <dig> molecules. zp <dig> and zp <dig> were shown to interact directly with sperm membrane receptors after and before the ar, respectively  <cit> . the demonstration that many species, including humans, contain a fourth zona protein, zp <dig>  which is absent in mice, raises questions about the extent to which the murine model can be applied to other zp4-containing species. our study characterises the human zp bioactivity before and after fertilisation. to reach this objective, we have collected both unfertilised and fertilised human oocytes and the physiological relevance of this material to real unfertilised oocytes or fertilised zygotes must be considered.

relevance of unfertilised and fertilised oocytes to study zp bioactivity
for practical and ethical reasons, only unfertilised or fertilised oocytes which are usually discarded in an ivf program can be used for experiments. consequently, the oocytes and zygotes have to be cultured for  <dig> h before deciding to use them for research. could this condition be responsible for uncertain or dubious physiological relevance of measured zp bioactivity? it has been shown previously that unfertilised oocytes collected after ivf failure could be used to study sperm – zp interaction  <cit> . in our study, unfertilised oocytes were mature but no pronucleus was observed  <dig> hours post insemination and no cleavage occurred within  <dig> hours. furthermore, we controlled that there was no zp <dig> proteolysis in these unfertilised oocytes. on the contrary, fertilised oocytes defined by the presence of at least  <dig> pn at  <dig> hours after fertilisation or by the presence of  <dig> pn but abnormal cleavage after  <dig> hours had a zp <dig> cleaved in two bands of  <dig> and  <dig> kda, denoting a limited proteolysis likely due to cortical granule exocytosis  <cit> . therefore, we are confident that the material used in our study was relevant to unfertilised oocytes or fertilised zygotes to analyse hzp bioactivity.

fertilised human zp may bind spermatozoa and induce acrosome reactions but are not penetrated by sperm
in mice, spermatozoa do not bind to fertilised oocytes and the zp <dig> protein purified from two-cell embryos cannot induce the ar in mouse spermatozoa  <cit> . surprisingly, we observed that zona pellucida of human fertilised oocytes, retain its capacity to bind spermatozoa, albeit about half as efficiently as zona from unfertilised oocytes and was able to induce an intra-spermatic calcium influx of the same amplitude as hzp from unfertilised oocytes. the spermatozoa bound to fertilised oocytes were found to be both acrosome-reacted and acrosome-intact spermatozoa. a recent study has reported that acrosome-reacted spermatozoa have a drastically reduced or zero ability to directly bind zp  <cit> . therefore, it may be hypothesised that acrosome-reacted spermatozoa observed on fertilised zp were acrosome intact before attachment to zp, and underwent the ar upon contact with hzp. our data suggest that  hzp of fertilised oocytes is able to bind sperm and to induce ar  and  acrosome-reacted spermatozoa remain attached to fertilised zp despite the cleavage of zp <dig>  thus the human glycoproteins involved in sperm binding and ar induction – presumably zp <dig>  and zp <dig>   <cit>  – seem to remain functional after fertilisation. this is the original point of our study that contrasts with observations in mice showing that fertilisation modifies the zp, preventing sperm binding and ar induction. the zp of mouse embryos was clearly shown to be unable to induce the ar in mouse spermatozoa, in experiments using purified zp <dig> from the embryo as an inducer  <cit> , but post-fertilisation modifications of mouse zp <dig> have not been demonstrated directly. thus, the mouse gamete interaction does not seem to model the situation in human in a reliable manner. could the additional glycoprotein, zp <dig>  present in human oocyte but not in mice account for this difference? does zp <dig> work individually or in a heterocomplex with zp <dig>  as described in boars  <cit> ?

in our study, the biochemical analysis of the hzp collected after fertilisation confirmed that zp <dig> was cleaved, demonstrating that sperm binding and the ar can occur whether zp <dig> is cleaved or uncleaved. using a model of chimeric human-mouse oocytes obtained by transgenesis, rankin et al.  <cit>  suggested that sperm binding is a function of the supramolecular structure of the zp, modulated by the cleavage status of zp <dig>  with sperm binding occurring when zp <dig> is uncleaved but not when zp <dig> is cleaved. our observation of sperm binding to the zona pellucida when human fertilised oocytes with cleaved zp <dig> were re-inseminated suggests that rankin's model, although appropriate for oocytes with three zona glycoproteins as in mouse or chimeric human-mouse zp, would not be applicable to species with four zona proteins, as in humans.

intact hzp from fertilised and unfertilised human oocytes are equally efficient in inducing the ar, with similar rates as reported previously for unfertilised oocytes  <cit> . by contrast, solubilised zp-induced ar rates measured in the present study were two times higher  than those previously reported   <cit> . this difference can arise from different experimental conditions  or from the probes used to reveal the ar. we used the anti-cd <dig> antibody coupled to the flow cytometry to measure solubilised hzp-induced ar and not the psa lectin labelling widely used in the other studies. from our knowledge, this is the first time that the flow cytometry, an objective method which allows counting on several thousand cells, was used to measure zp-induced ar. as psa lectin is not the most suitable probe for ar measurement in flow cytometry  <cit> , we have chosen anti-cd <dig> antibody that gives for acrosome-reacted cells a high fluorescent peak well separated from the low fluorescent peak of intact cells  <cit> . by contrast, the fluorescent peaks of intact and acrosome-reacted spermatozoa are more or less overlapped when psa lectin staining is used  <cit> . in our study, the use of two different probes to mark the ar induced by either solubilised  or intact  zp, does not make it possible to compare the results. indeed, it is known that different methods of ar staining never give the same results when the probes target different sites in the sperm cells, measuring different steps in the ar kinetics  <cit> . our objective was to compare the ar inducing ability of zp of fertilised and unfertilised oocytes within a same experiment.

in our experiments, more than 80% of fertilised oocytes co-incubated with capacitated spermatozoa had no spermatozoa within their zp. this observation shows that human fertilised oocytes cannot be more penetrated by spermatozoa and is consistent with the murine model as demonstrated in previous studies  <cit> . this inhibition of sperm penetration could be temporally correlated with the proteolytic cleavage of zp <dig>  demonstrated after fertilisation in mice  <cit>  and in humans .

in summary, the events of zp sperm binding/ar induction and zona penetration can be dissociated in humans. the main step of polyspermy blocking would be the inhibition of the acrosome-reacted sperm penetration through the zona after fertilisation. some post-fertilisation architectural alterations could provoke a hardening of the zona which make it impossible to be lysed by the acrosomal enzymes.

zp-induced calcium influx in human capacitated spermatozoa is biphasic and involves voltage-dependent channels
among the different functions of zp analysed in this work, we have brought particular attention to the zp-induced calcium influx in spermatozoa. until now, this function of zp had not been studied in humans, except with recombinant zp <dig> as the inducer  <cit> . our study brings detailed information on intraspermatic calcium increase induced by solubilised hzp. when disaggregated by acid treatment, it retained its ability to induce an intracellular increase in calcium concentration, as previously reported for ar induction  <cit> .

the calcium influx induced by solubilised hzp displayed qualitative and quantitative aspects similar to those reported for other species. using spectrofluorimetry, we found that the calcium response to hzp may be biphasic or monophasic, depending on the sample. previous studies using spectrofluorimetry and a similar probe showed that the ca2+ response to solubilised mouse zp  <cit>  or recombinant hzp <dig>  <cit>  was biphasic, with a first transient peak and a second sustained phase. however, in nine of the  <dig> cases analysed in our study, the calcium response appeared to be monophasic, with only sustained increase in calcium concentration. either the transient calcium peak did not occur or it developed so rapidly that it was not recorded in our conditions. if the initial peak lasted  <dig> ms as in mice  <cit> , the peak development was probably too rapid to be detected, and this could explain the previous reports of a monophasic increase in calcium concentration in response to zp in cattle  <cit>  and in mice  <cit> . however, shirakawa and miyazaki  <cit>  detected no transient calcium peak with recordings taken at  <dig> -second intervals in the hamster sperm head after the addition of solubilised zp. these results and ours suggest that a sustained calcium influx, keeping i high for a sufficiently long period, may be sufficient to trigger the ar. the importance of the sustained phase in ar induction is also illustrated by the similar ar rates induced by hzp in sperm samples with monophasic and biphasic calcium responses.

the calcium response to solubilised human zp is sensitive to pimozide , suggesting that vocc is involved in this ionic event. t-type vocc activity, involving the cay <dig>  channel in particular, has been associated with ar in humans  <cit>  and it has been shown that zp-induced calcium entry and ar depend on t-type vocc in mice  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
one of the major findings of this study is that human zp retains its ability to bind spermatozoa, and to induce intraspermatic calcium influx and ar after fertilisation even if sperm penetration through fertilised zp is strongly inhibited. the zp-induced influx of calcium into human spermatozoa follows similar kinetics and has a similar sensitivity to vocc inhibitors to that observed in response to solubilised zp or purified zp <dig> in mouse spermatozoa. the zp bioactivity is not abolished by fertilisation, despite modification of the biochemical status of zp <dig>  from an uncleaved to a cleaved form. compared to the mice model, this difference of zp bioactivity could be linked to the presence of zp <dig>  which is not produced in mice. thus, the place of zp <dig> in the hzp matrix, its relation to other hzp glycoproteins, its function in the primary steps of gamete interaction , and its modification after fertilisation require further study in humans.
