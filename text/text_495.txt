BACKGROUND
whiteflies are notorious agricultural pests that have become major threats to global food security and cause damage to crops by direct feeding and efficient transmission of numerous viruses infecting food, fiber, and ornamental crops worldwide. among the  <dig> known whitefly species in  <dig> genera  <cit> , bemisia tabaci  is particularly important because of its ability to infest more than  <dig> plant species  <cit>  and transmit more than  <dig> plant pathogenic viruses  <cit> . major crops affected by b. tabaci-transmitted viruses on a global scale include tomato, cassava, cotton, cucurbits, sweet potato, and numerous other species. bemisia tabaci-transmitted tomato yellow leaf curl virus  causes one of the most devastating diseases affecting tomato production  <cit>  and has spread globally  <cit> , while outbreaks of cassava mosaic disease  and cassava brown streak disease  have reached epidemic levels in africa  and are so severe that the global alliance on cassava virus research has declared war against whiteflies and the viruses they transmit  <cit> . furthermore, increasing global commodity trade, climate change, and intensive crop production are facilitating both the global dispersal and the development of super-abundant populations of b. tabaci, one of the  <dig> worst invasive alien species in the world .


bemisia tabaci was first identified as a new pest species in  <dig> in greece  <cit>  and is now recognized to comprise multiple genetic groups, also known as “biotypes”  <cit> . early work that assigned b. tabaci to various biotypes on the basis of several biological properties such as host range, behavior, insecticide resistance, and virus transmission capacity  <cit>  has been replaced by more reliable molecular criteria for b. tabaci differentiation. for example, at least  <dig> genetic groups  of b. tabaci have been discriminated based on the sequence divergence of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase i  gene , including two globally important pest taxa: middle east-asia minor  <dig>  and mediterranean   <cit> .

despite its agronomic importance, genomic resources for the b. tabaci whitefly are limited. multiple transcriptome data are available, addressing the phylogenetic relationship and transcriptome sequence divergence of different b. tabaci species  <cit> , responses to a begomovirus  <cit> , insecticide resistance  <cit> , development and organ-specific patterns of gene expression , and the interactions with symbiotic bacteria required by the insect  <cit> . however, a fully sequenced b. tabaci genome is still greatly needed for further resolution of the species complex conundrum. in addition, a reference genome will assist our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying virus transmission, detoxification, host adaptation, and insecticide resistance.

here, we present a high-quality draft genome sequence of b. tabaci meam <dig>  which was assembled using a hybrid approach involving illumina short reads and pacbio long reads. this assembly represents the first genome sequence of a member of the family aleyrodidae. the availability of the b. tabaci genome not only provides novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of the whitefly’s global invasiveness and high virus transmission capacity but also presents valuable information to help understand the b. tabaci species complex and to facilitate the development of improved strategies for efficient whitefly management.

RESULTS
the genome of b. tabaci
whiteflies from a b. tabaci colony established from a single female collected at the united states department of agriculture -agricultural research service  in charleston, south carolina  were used for genome sequencing . polymerase chain reaction  analysis using primers against the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase i  gene  <cit>  indicates that the colony is a member of the meam <dig> species. a total of  <dig>  gb high-quality cleaned illumina sequences and  <dig> gb pacbio long reads were generated , which represented ~300-fold coverage of the b. tabaci meam <dig> genome, which has an estimated size of ~690 mb  <cit> . de novo assembly using illumina and pacbio sequences resulted in a final draft genome of  <dig>  mb with an n <dig> scaffold size of  <dig>  mb, which spanned  <dig> % of the b. tabaci genome . quality evaluation using software involving benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs   <cit>  revealed that  <dig> % of the core eukaryotic genes were captured by the b. tabaci genome assembly and  <dig> % were complete. in addition, the high mapping rates of the published whitefly mrna sequences as well as our paired-end rna-seq reads further supported the high quality of the b. tabaci genome assembly .fig.  <dig> whitefly phylogenomics and gene family expansions. a adult whiteflies bemisia tabaci. ♀ female, ♂ male. b phylogenetic relationship and gene orthology of b. tabaci and other arthropods. 1:1: <dig> indicates single-copy genes in all species; n:n:n indicates multi-copy genes in all species; insect specific refers to genes present only in the  <dig> insect species; endopterygota refers to genes present only in at least two endopterygotan insects; exopterygota refers to genes present only in at least two exopterygotan insects. c significantly expanded domains in b. tabaci. bta b. tabaci, api acyrthosiphon pisum, dci diaphorina citri, rpr rhodnius prolixus, nlu nilaparvata lugens, phu pediculus humanus, nvi nasonia vitripennis, ame apis mellifera, cfl camponotus floridanus, tca tribolium castaneum, bmo bombyx mori, dpl danaus plexippus, aga anopheles gambiae, dme drosophila melanogaster, dpu daphnia pulex, tur tetranychus urticae




aonly contigs and scaffolds > =500 bp were included in the genome assembly




a total of  <dig>  mb  of repeat sequences were identified in the b. tabaci genome, which is slightly higher than that of the related hemipteran acyrthosiphon pisum genome   <cit> . among these repeats, ~ <dig>  mb  were annotated as miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements , while  <dig>  mb  could not be classified into any known families . a total of  <dig>  protein-coding genes were predicted in the b. tabaci genome, among which  <dig>   were supported by our rna-seq data,  <dig>  by homologous proteins, and  <dig>  by both. of these, 81% were functionally annotated . despite the different sizes of the assembled b. tabaci  and d. melanogaster  genomes, the number of protein-coding genes in the two species was similar . the mean coding sequence length of the genomes was also similar, while the mean intron and untranslated region  lengths in b. tabaci were considerably larger than those in d. melanogaster .

genome-based phylogeny and genome comparisons
we compared b. tabaci protein-coding genes with those of five exopterygotan insects, eight endopterygotan insects, and two non-insect arthropod species  to identify orthologous groups. the phylogeny of these  <dig> species, based on  <dig> single-copy orthologous genes, shows that b. tabaci is a sister taxon to a. pisum , forming a lineage together with three other hemipteran insects: nilaparvata lugens , rhodnius prolixus , and diaphorina citri  . interestingly, no syntenic blocks were identified between any of these hemipteran genomes. this is different from the lepidoptera heliconius melpomene , bombyx mori , and plutella xylostella , whose genomes share high synteny  <cit> . our analysis suggests that genomes of the five hemipteran insects, b. tabaci, a. pisum, n. lugens, r. prolixus, and d. citri, are highly divergent, consistent with previous reports suggesting that b. tabaci and a. pisum diverged about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> , whereas h. melpomene and b. mori diverged about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> .

among the  <dig>  genes in the b. tabaci genome,  <dig>   had detectable homologs in the other  <dig> arthropods, including  <dig>  that were conserved in all  <dig> species . a total of  <dig> genes  including  <dig> single-copy genes were found to be unique in b. tabaci. furthermore, a total of  <dig> protein domains, which represented  <dig> gene families, were found to be significantly expanded in b. tabaci . these expanded gene families include those that are potentially involved in virus transmission or insecticide resistance, in addition to those that were horizontally transferred .

vector for plant virus transmission

bemisia tabaci is one of the most prevalent and agriculturally important vectors of plant viruses, capable of transmitting viruses from at least five genera  <cit> . we compared transcriptome profiles of whiteflies during the first three days of virus acquisition feeding on tomato plants infected with tylcv , which is transmitted by b. tabaci in a persistent circulative manner, or tomato chlorosis virus , which is transmitted in a semipersistent, non-circulative manner, to the corresponding whiteflies feeding on virus-free tomato plants for the same time periods. we found that during the acquisition feeding of tylcv- or tocv-infected tomato plants, a large number of cathepsin genes were differentially expressed including  <dig> cathepsin b, five cathepsin l-like, three cathepsin f, and one cathepsin f-like genes . cathepsins are proteases involved in many biological processes, including protein degradation, apoptosis, and signaling, and their activity in the late endosome and lysosome has been widely implicated in virus transmission  <cit> . a total of  <dig> cathepsin genes were detected in the b. tabaci genome , representing a significant expansion when compared to the other  <dig> arthropod species that were examined . specifically, a large expansion of cathepsin b genes was observed, with  <dig> members identified, many of which were tandem duplications. in addition, the b. tabaci genome contains  <dig> cathepsin l-like genes, while none were found in the genomes of the other  <dig> arthropods, indicating that these unique cathepsin l-like genes represent a novel b. tabaci-specific clade of cathepsins . the expansion of cathepsin b and l-like families in b. tabaci could be tied to the tremendous efficiency of this insect species as a vector of numerous and diverse plant viruses, possibly through its involvement in immune responses to virus acquisition or other responses that govern whitefly-virus interactions.fig.  <dig> whitefly genes associated with virus acquisition and transmission. a heatmap of differentially expressed cathepsin genes  in whiteflies upon acquisition of tylcv or tocv after  <dig>   <dig> and 72 h, respectively. three biological replicates were performed for each sample. color indicates fold change of gene expression . b phylogenetic tree of cysteine proteinase-type cathepsins in b. tabaci and other species. maximum likelihood tree was constructed using amino acid sequences of the peptidase c1a domain. human cathepsins from human,_mouse cathepsins from mouse,_rat cathepsins from rat,_drome cathepsins from fruit fly. c gene clusters containing whitefly-specific genes that were differentially expressed upon tocv acquisition. genes marked by asterisk are differentially expressed. genes in same colors in each cluster are duplicated genes, while genes in white are non-duplicated




interestingly, three large clusters in the b. tabaci genome were found to contain b. tabaci-specific unknown genes that were differentially expressed during acquisition feeding of b. tabaci on tocv-infected tomato plants. most of these genes were tandem duplications . our results suggest that during the evolution of b. tabaci, these specific genomic regions might have contributed to the elevated ability of this whitefly to transmit plant viruses, particularly non-circulative, semipersistent viruses, since these genes were not differentially expressed during feeding on tomatoes infected with the persistent, circulative virus, tylcv. the differential expression of these unique clusters in specific association with virus acquisition feeding on tocv-infected tomato indicates a response by the whitefly to either tocv itself or to host factors uniquely expressed in the tomato plant during infection by tocv. although no function has been attributed to these genes, their expression during acquisition of tocv from infected tomato plants suggests they may represent genes that are co-evolved in the whitefly vector that facilitate uptake, retention, or transmission of tocv and perhaps other semipersistent viruses.

detoxification and insecticide resistance

bemisia tabaci is highly polyphagous, being able to feed on more than  <dig> different plant species, and is notable for its rapid development of resistance to numerous insecticides. thus, b. tabaci likely have developed the capacity to overcome a wide variety of plant defense compounds and insecticides. several enzyme families implicated in detoxification were identified in the b. tabaci genome, including cytochrome p450s , udp-glucuronosyltransferases , glutathione s-transferases , abc transporters , and carboxylesterases  . the b. tabaci genome contains  <dig> cyps, representing a significant expansion relative to most insects with genomes sequenced. notable expansions include a novel family  with  <dig> members, the cyp4cs subfamily with  <dig> genes, and the cyp402c subfamily with  <dig> members . the b. tabaci genome encodes  <dig> ugts, similar to tetranychus urticae  and a. pisum , but substantially more than the amount found in other insects . additionally,  <dig> gst ,  <dig> abc , and  <dig> cce genes were detected in the b. tabaci genome. expansion of some of these detoxification gene families in b. tabaci likely provides a basis for its well-known insecticide resistance and its ability to occupy a broad range of host plants with a diversity of defenses.

currently, the meam <dig> and med cryptic species of b. tabaci are the most widely prevalent throughout the world and have greatly expanded their ranges over the past two decades, with med having developed broader insecticide resistance than meam <dig>  <cit> . we compared global transcriptome profiles of a susceptible med population , as well as a resistant med population , with and without treatment with the insecticide mospilan . as expected, all of the aforementioned detoxification families contained genes that were responsive to mospilan treatment in both susceptible and resistant populations, supporting their roles in whitefly insecticide resistance . interestingly, numerous genes from the highly expanded cathepsin family were differentially expressed upon mospilan treatment, with  <dig> and  <dig> in susceptible and resistant populations, respectively. cathepsins have been associated with the polyphagous habit of the whitefly  <cit> . this and the novel role of cathepsins in insecticide resistance revealed here suggest that cathepsins might have contributed to the global invasiveness of the whitefly.fig.  <dig> whitefly genes responsive to insecticide mospilan. a number of mospilan-responsive genes encoding phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein , cathepsin , cytochrome p <dig> , udp-glucuronosyltransferase , carboxylesterase , abc transporter , glutathione s-transferase , and aromatic peroxygenase  in susceptible and resistant med populations. three or four biological replicates were performed for each control or mospilan-treated sample. detailed expression information of these genes is provided in additional file  <dig>  b phylogenetic tree of pebps in b. tabaci and other arthropod species. c two largest clusters of pebps on scaffold <dig>  with  <dig> and  <dig> copies, respectively. red pebp genes located in the positive strand of the scaffold, blue pebp genes located in the negative strand of the scaffold, white non-pebp genes. genes marked with asterisk are mospilan-responsive




in addition, the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein  gene family, which has not been previously associated with detoxification or insecticide resistance in insects, showed striking responses to mospilan treatment. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> pebp genes were responsive to mospilan treatment in the med resistant and susceptible populations, respectively, all of which were down-regulated . pebps are a highly conserved group of proteins that have been identified in a wide variety of organisms  <cit>  and associated with various biological processes, including neuronal development  <cit> , serine protease inhibition  <cit> , and regulation of mitogen-activated protein  kinase  <cit>  and nf-kappab  <cit>  signaling pathways. our analysis supports a novel and very important role for the pebps in insect resistance to pesticides. the b. tabaci genome contained  <dig> pebps, representing a tremendously expanded gene family and containing several new clades/subfamilies . by comparison, the genomes of the other  <dig> arthropods had a maximum of  <dig> pebps. among the b. tabaci pebps,  <dig> were located in five large tandem clusters, the majority of which were responsive to insecticide treatment . our data suggest a strong role for pebps in b. tabaci insecticide resistance; the large expansion of this family may have contributed to its rapidly evolved insecticide resistance.

endosymbiont genomes
whiteflies harbor endosymbiotic bacteria, comprising a primary symbiont portiera aleyrodidarum and one or more additional bacteria, generically known as secondary symbionts  <cit> . diagnostic pcr assays using the primers described in pan et al.  <cit>  indicated that the colony of meam <dig> used for genome sequencing bore the primary endosymbiont, portiera, and two secondary endosymbionts, hamiltonella and rickettsia. the genomes of the three endosymbionts were assembled de novo, with each assembled into a single contig. the assembled genome of portiera was complete with a size of 352 kb, while those of hamiltonella and rickettsia were nearly complete, with sizes of  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb, respectively . in portiera,  <dig> genes were predicted, suggesting that it has a highly reduced genome largely comprising genes essential for basic cellular processes and whitefly nutrition. by contrast,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were predicted in hamiltonella and rickettsia, respectively. hamiltonella possesses  <dig>  phage genes and numerous genes involved in the type ii/iii secretion systems. approximately 22% of the rickettsia genes are homologous to transposable elements, suggesting that the genome is highly dynamic. comparative analysis of the b. tabaci genome with the portiera and hamiltonella genomes identified genes coding for complementary reactions in multiple metabolic pathways, including essential amino acid biosynthesis , as reported previously  <cit> . analysis of the rickettsia genome also shows the absence of genes for non-essential amino acid biosynthesis . neither b. tabaci nor any of the endosymbiont bacteria appear to encode known enzymes that catalyze the conversion of histidinol to histidine, suggesting that one or more of these organisms might contain a non-canonical enzyme for the final step of histidine biosynthesis. the biosynthetic pathway leading from homoserine to methionine is incomplete in b. tabaci and its endosymbionts. however, b. tabaci does encode homocysteine methyltransferase, an enzyme that produces methionine from s-methylmethionine, one of the most abundant sulfur transport molecules in plants  <cit> . the homocysteine necessary for this reaction can be produced as a by-product of the s-adenosylmethionine cycle, which is present in b. tabaci and its endosymbionts. almost all genes of the branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis pathways are present in portiera. it is notable that branched chain amino acid aminotransferase, the only gene missing in portiera, is present in both b. tabaci and rickettsia, indicating that these two organisms can independently produce leucine, isoleucine, and valine from the respective oxo-acids.


genes acquired horizontally from bacteria and fungi
the recent rapid accumulation of genomic data has facilitated the identification of increasing numbers of horizontally acquired exogenous dna sequences in the genomes of animals, including insects  <cit> . we identified  <dig> horizontal gene transfers  in the b. tabaci genome, with  <dig> of bacterial origin  and  <dig> of fungal origin . recent reports on hgts in the tardigrade genomes  <cit>  have demonstrated the importance of carefully examining eukaryotic genome assemblies to distinguish contaminants from authentic hgts. in this study, we provide multiple lines of evidence to support the identified hgts, including the alignments of paired-end and mate pair dna reads and polya-enriched strand-specific rna-seq reads . in addition, our rna-seq data indicated that most of the hgts were moderately or highly expressed, and  <dig> hgts of bacterial origin were previously confirmed by qpcr  <cit> . together, our data strongly support the high confidence of the identified hgts in the b. tabaci genome.

the majority of the b. tabaci hgts  had predicted enzymatic functions. hgts of bacterial origin mainly contributed to amino acid synthesis, vitamin synthesis, and lipid metabolism, while those of fungal origin mainly contributed to carbohydrate processes, pro-oxidant functions, and lipid metabolism. two cases of co-transfer of two genes were identified: bioa-biod phylogenetically allied with the bacterium cardinium and panb-panc allied with the bacterium pseudomonas, which encode enzymes in the biosynthesis pathways of biotin  and pantothenate , respectively. the bioa and biod genes are adjacent to one another in the cardinium genome; however, in the b. tabaci genome they are arranged as two sets of adjacent genes, with the bioa truncated in one pair , and biod truncated in the second pair  , suggesting that the genes were duplicated and pseudogenized due to functional redundancy. in the other case, panb and panc are two adjacent genes in pseudomonas, but become a single gene in the b. tabaci genome and have acquired introns . it has been reported that genes of bacterial origin can acquire introns after their transfer into eukaryotic genomes  <cit> , and a large portion of b. tabaci hgts of bacterial origin also contain introns . however, as far as we know, no reports have described that two adjacent bacterial genes might have been fused into one gene and acquired introns after horizontal transfer. this arrangement of panb and panc in b. tabaci likely promotes coordinated enzymatic functions. the panb and panc domains of the fused protein are predicted to mediate the proximal and final reactions in pantothenate synthesis. neither b. tabaci nor its primary endosymbiont portiera apparently possesses the canonical gene, pane, mediating the intermediate step. however, portiera does have ilvc, which has been shown to mediate the pane reaction in another symbiotic bacterium   <cit> , suggesting that b. tabaci-portiera association may be capable of pantothenate synthesis by a shared metabolic pathway between the horizontally acquired gene in the insect genome and the symbiont gene .fig.  <dig> horizontal gene transfers in whitefly. a genome synteny of panb-panc between b. tabaci and pseudomonas. red positive strand, blue negative strand, pink untranslated regions. b coordinated pathway of the pantothenate synthesis between b. tabaci and its symbiont portiera. gene in blue is b. tabaci intrinsic, gene in orange is from portiera, and genes in red are horizontally transferred. c phylogenetic tree of b. tabaci squalene-hopene cyclases of bacterial origin and those from other kingdoms. numbers on branches represent bootstrap values, only those > <dig> are shown




the b. tabaci genome contains a gene of fungal origin annotated as squalene synthase , which mediates the first committed reaction in sterol synthesis, and seven genes of bacterial origin coding for squalene-hopene cyclases , which are predicted to synthesize hopanoids, the bacterial analogs of sterols. in animals, including insects, sterols function to maintain the structural integrity of membranes and also act as hormones   <cit> . although most animals can synthesize sterols, insects and other arthropods lack this metabolic capability and are generally dependent on a dietary supply of sterols  <cit> . the potential capacity of b. tabaci to synthesize sterols/hopanoids, which would negate their dietary requirement, may be of selective advantage given that phloem sap has low sterol content  <cit> , and may contribute to the exceptionally wide host range of this whitefly species.

we detected  <dig> aromatic peroxygenase  genes of fungal origin in the b. tabaci genome, but none were present in any other insect genomes. apos function in detoxification by selectively hydroxylating the aromatic ring of toxic compounds such as naphthalene  <cit> . in fungi, these enzymes have been implicated in the degradation of complex plant biomolecules  <cit> . one of the apos was differentially expressed upon treatment with the insecticide mospilan . we hypothesize that expression of the horizontally transferred apos could contribute to the insecticide resistance of whiteflies as well as their high capacity for xenobiotic detoxification.

CONCLUSIONS
the whitefly b. tabaci represents one of the most agronomically significant pests. our analysis of the b. tabaci genome also included chemosensory genes, immunity-related genes, and genes in the rna interference  pathway . analyses of the b. tabaci genome reveal numerous genetic novelties that likely have shaped whiteflies as a highly invasive pest of agricultural crops and as one of the most prevalent and efficient transmitters of plant viruses. these include  several b. tabaci-specific gene clusters that are tandemly duplicated and uniquely responsive to feeding on virus-infected plants;  largely expanded gene families including cathepsins, cyps, ugts, and pebps that have potential roles in virus transmission, polyphagy, detoxification, and/or insecticide resistance; and  numerous genes horizontally transferred from bacteria and fungi, including those involved in essential amino acid and hopanoid/sterol synthesis, in addition to apos with putative roles in detoxification. the b. tabaci genome reported here provides an important advance for understanding whitefly biology, with implications for insect pest management and associated virus control. furthermore, the b. tabaci genome represents the first genome sequence in the aleyrodidae family and is highly divergent from other sequenced hemipteran genomes, providing a valuable resource for future comparative and evolutionary genomic studies.
