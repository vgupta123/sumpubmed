BACKGROUND
detection and identification of mycobacteria in clinical specimens is a key issue in the therapy of pulmonary diseases because misidentification can lead to inappropriate treatment. traditionally, mycobacterial species are identified based on their growth rate, presence or absence of pigmentation, and using biochemical assays of the isolates recovered from specimens. the biochemical assays are time-consuming and labor-intensive, usually taking  <dig> to  <dig> months to complete, and assays for non-tuberculous mycobacteria  species can have poor reproducibility and provide ambiguous results  <cit> .

by contrast, molecular identification, notably pcr-restriction enzyme analysis , is rapid and simple. the hsp <dig> pra method, developed by telenti et al. in  <dig>  is a popular dna-based method for mycobacteria identification  <cit> . using hsp <dig> pra, wong et al.  <cit>  reported 100% sensitivity and specificity in identifying mycobacterium tuberculosis complexes but only  <dig> % sensitivity in identifying ntm species. this misidentification may occur because of similarities in band sizes that are critical for species discrimination  <cit> . an additional contributing factor is a lack of knowledge of all existing pra profiles, especially among species that are very heterogeneous, such as m. gordonae, m. scrofulaceum, and m. terrae complexes. recently, capillary electrophoresis  with computer analysis  <cit>  has provided more precise band discrimination than analysis by the naked eye.

previously, we developed an algorithm for mycobacterial species identification from acid-fast bacillus  smear-positive bactec tubes by combining the rpob duplex pra   <cit>  and the key phenotypic characters of mycobacteria recovered from the tubes  <cit> . using rpob dpra, we differentiated mycobacterium tuberculosis complexes  from ntm with  <dig> base pair  and  <dig> bp pcr amplicons in afb smear-positive bactec cultures. the  <dig> bp rpob duplex pcr amplicon was further digested with mspi and haeiii  to divide the ntm species into eight easily distinguishable groups  as described by kim et al.  <cit> . using two phenotypic characters  and two simple biochemical assays   <cit> , the mycobacterial species were identified. however, the sub-culture and biochemical tests for this algorithm took three weeks.

in the present study, we developed a rapid and effective algorithm for identification of mycobacteria by combined rpob dpra and hsp <dig> pra with ce.

RESULTS
mycobacteria identification
there were  <dig> afb smear-positive bactec culture tubes , including  <dig> mtc and  <dig> ntm-containing bactec cultures. a further  <dig> bacteria were mgit positive but afb culture smear negative, and these were classed as contaminated and excluded from subsequent evaluation.

by rpob duplex pcr, all of the  <dig> mtc-containing bactec cultures and the  <dig> ntm-containing bactec cultures showed 235-bp and 136-bp pcr amplicons specific for mtc and ntm, respectively. the species were identified according to the flow chart shown in figure  <dig> 

concordant results from rpob dpra and hsp <dig> pra
combining rpob dpra and hsp <dig> pra with computer-aided ce gave an accuracy rate of 100%  for mtc and  <dig> %  for ntm .

* m. peregrinum was identified as m. fortuitum by a conventional biochemical method.

**m. avium subsp. avium and m. intracellulare were identified as m. avium complex by a conventional biochemical method.

discordant results from rpob dpra and hsp <dig> pra
there were  <dig> isolates  of ntm with discordant results with rpob dpra and hsp <dig> pra . the two isolates, mycobacterial species  and m. flavescens  identified by  <dig> s rdna sequencing represented new patterns not available in the hsp <dig> pra databases and might be new sub-types in hsp <dig> pra. for mycobacterial species,  <dig> s rdna sequencing did not confirm the identity of the isolate but conventional biochemical identification showed it was m. mucogenicum.

development of a species identification algorithm
the results in tables  <dig> and  <dig> and the mycobacterial identification flow chart  were used to develop a species identification algorithm by combining rpob duplex pcr  <cit>  and hsp <dig> pra  <cit>  using the most common  <dig> patterns of  <dig> species in table  <dig>  in this algorithm , we added m. gordonae types  <dig> and  <dig> to the f group. the accuracy rate for ntm by combining the two methods could reach  <dig> % .

species from table  <dig> were included in this algorithm.

discussion
mycobacterial species identification is generally achieved by standard culture and biochemical methods  <cit> . biochemical methods are labor-intensive and time-consuming, and not all are reproducible  <cit> . recently, pra and dpra have been developed for molecular identification of mycobacterial species using different regions of hsp <dig>   <dig> s rdna,  <dig> s- <dig> s rdna spacer, dnaj, and rpob as an amplification target  <cit> . the most common method is hsp <dig> pra, and  <dig> patterns for  <dig> species are available in the prasite database .

previous studies  <cit>  have reported that hsp <dig> pra is faster and more accurate for species identification than conventional  testing. this is because more incorrect and ambiguous results are obtained with conventional methods. the results in our study  also support this finding. incorrect and ambiguous results are caused by phenotypic homogeneity among different species and phenotypic variability within species  <cit> . with by hsp <dig> pra, some sub-species, such as m. kansasii, can be identified and rapid-growing mycobacterium can be divided into m. abscessus and m.chelonae, m. fortuitum and m. smegmatis <cit> , whereas these identifications are difficult with conventional methods  <cit> . as found in our study , m. peregrinum was identified as m. fortuitum and m. avium subsp. avium and m. intracellulare were both identified as m. avium complex by the conventional biochemical method.

however, hsp <dig> pra limitations have been reported in some articles  <cit> . failure to identify or incorrect identification of the species may occur because of similarities in band sizes critical for discriminating species, including difficult to distinguish m. tuberculosis complex   <cit> , and closely related sub-species such as m. avium or m. gordonae, because of sequence heterogeneity  <cit> . in addition, technical problems can also cause misinterpretation or incorrect identification  <cit> . patterns in pra profiles are complex and difficult to interpret with the naked eye, especially when more detailed sub-types are included  <cit> .

this study combined rpob dpra and hsp <dig> pra to test both reference strains and clinical respiratory isolates. the mycobacterial identification flow chart  can identify species to the sub-species level, and final species identification can be obtained instantly with concordant results from the two pra. m. gordonae has a highly variable gene sequence with  <dig> sub-types in hsp <dig> pra, and there are two groups  in rpob dpra. most m. gordonae is in the g group, but m. gordonae types  <dig> and  <dig> by hsp <dig> pra are in the f group .

in addition, there were different rpob dpra results  for m. simaie type  <dig> , m. scrofulaceum type  <dig> , and m. intracellulare type  <dig> . the identities of all of these isolates were finally confirmed by  <dig> s rdna sequencing. variable numbers of restriction sites for haeiii in these species may derive from genetic sequence mutation. however, these species are included in the species identification algorithm even though they are uncommon isolates.

using the mycobacteria identification flow chart  and algorithm , m. avium-intracellulare complex  can be easily divided into m. avium spp. avium and m. intracellulare by both rpob dpra and hsp <dig> pra. by contrast, this was not possible with the conventional method. using the results in table  <dig>  some ntm species with identical or similar hsp <dig> pra can be clearly grouped by rpob dpra . ambiguous results from hsp <dig> pra alone are easier to interpret with combined rpob dpra and hsp <dig> pra. however, m. intermedium type  <dig> and m. intracellulare type  <dig> with identical hsp <dig> pra and rpob dpra  could not be differentiated further by this species identification algorithm and required  <dig> s rdna sequencing for confirmation.

although  <dig> s rdna sequencing is the standard method for mycobacterium species identification, it cannot differentiate some closely related rapid-growing mycobacterium species  <cit>  or slow-growing m. kansasii and m. gastri that had identical  <dig> s rdna sequences, but these can be differentiated by hsp <dig> pra and rpob dpra. there are some reports  <cit>  of conflicting results from different methods for mycobacterial species identification, probably caused by a failure of one method to identify all test strains correctly. combining methods for mycobacterial species identification can improve the accuracy rate, avoid ambiguous results, and save time.

many ce-based studies  <cit>  in pcr-rflp analysis have investigated improving band size discrimination. in one study by chang et al.  <cit> , high-resolution ce gave more precise estimates of dna fragment sizes than analysis by the naked eye, and ce could detect low molecular weight fragments . in our study, restriction fragments < <dig> bp were not selected for analysis to avoid confusion with primer and primer dimer bands. we found that more hsp <dig> fragment differences than rpob fragment  may explain the size differences with highly variable sequence for species identification but difficult interpretation in hsp <dig> pra.

some sub-types of ntm species are relevant to clinical management, such as the m. kansasii and mac. m. kansasii type  <dig> is the most common type associated with human disease  <cit>  because of its high pathogenicity. however, m. kansasii types 3– <dig> are most often isolated from the environment and rarely from humans, and have no significant role in clinical management  <cit> . mac can be divided into m. avium subsp. avium and m. intracellulare because drug sensitivity test and clinical outcomes are different between these two sub-types  <cit> .

it is important to identify ntm to the sub-type level both for epidemiologic data and for differentiating potentially pathogenic sub-types  <cit> . combined rpob dpra and hsp <dig> pra with capillary electrophoresis provides precise species identification and overcomes problems associated with discrimination by hsp <dig> pra band sizes. this combined method takes around 2– <dig> days to complete in the laboratory once clinical isolates have been received. however, the identification algorithm has some limitations. first, it could not discriminate m. intermedium type  <dig> from m. intracellulare type  <dig>  and second, not every hospital laboratory will be equipped with the appropriate equipment for this method.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the novel flow chart and identification algorithm obtained by combined rpob dpra and hsp <dig> pra with capillary electrophoresis can easily differentiate mtc from ntm and identify mycobacterial species to the sub-type level, which is helpful for clinical management. the results are complementary to  <dig> s rdna sequencing, and the effective algorithm provides rapid and accurate mycobacterial species identification.
