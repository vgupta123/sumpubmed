BACKGROUND
acylation stimulating protein  is a circulating adipokine elevated in obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease  <cit>  as well as other metabolic disorders with hyperlipidemia such as polycystic ovarian syndrome   <cit> , hypothyroidism  <cit>  and lipoprotein lipase  deficiency  <cit> . asp influences fat storage by stimulating diacylglycerol acyltransferase  activity, the rate limiting step in triglyceride  synthesis  <cit> , increasing glucose transporter glut <dig> translocation  <cit> , indirectly stimulating lpl activity in adipose tissue  <cit> , and inhibiting lipolysis  <cit> . these effects are mediated through the c5l <dig> receptor, a g protein-coupled receptor highly expressed in adipose tissue depots, skeletal muscle and liver  <cit> .

asp  is the cleavage product of complement c <dig> ; accordingly c <dig> knockout  mice are asp-deficient. furthermore, c3ko mice are characterized by having increased food intake  <cit> , delayed postprandial dietary triglyceride clearance  <cit> , increased oxygen consumption  <cit> , and greater muscle fatty acid oxidation relative to glycolysis  <cit> . asp receptor ko mice, c5l2ko, share a similar phenotype with c3ko mice. overall fatty acid oxidation is augmented , food intake is increased, and they also display delayed postprandial lipid clearance  <cit> . it is interesting to note that mice lacking either asp or c5l <dig> from in utero have less tg storage capacity in adipose tissue and greater fatty acid oxidation in muscle. moreover, these effects have also been observed in wildtype  mice treated acutely with asp/c5l2-neutralizing antibodies  <cit> .

in a previous short-term pilot study, antibodies designed to block asp-c5l <dig> interaction, i.e., antibodies against asp  or c5l <dig> , were both shown to inhibit asp stimulated tg synthesis and glucose transport in preadipocytes and mature adipocytes  <cit> . these antibodies were then administered daily to wt mice on a low-fat diet over the course of a short  <dig> day study. the results showed no difference in body weight or food intake with antibody treatment, however there were significant changes in lipid metabolism and adipose tissue and skeletal muscle enzyme activity. adipose tissue tg mass and lpl activity were reduced, while skeletal muscle ampk activity was increased  <cit> . therefore, even with short term administration, neutralizing antibodies blocking asp-c5l <dig> interaction resulted in beneficial altered lipid distribution and energy utilization in wt mice.

based on the previous observations of altered muscle activity and substrate utilization, the present study examines energy expenditure and substrate storage over a longer timeframe  in wt mice administered a constant delivery of antibody. further, the mice were challenged with a high-fat diet two weeks prior to, and during, the treatment. in addition, in the present study, we investigated the consequences of asp supplementation in wt mice following initiation of a high-fat diet.

methods
anti-asp and recombinant asp production
polyclonal rabbit antibody against human asp  was developed as previously described  <cit> . the igg fraction was isolated from plasma by gamma sepharose chromatography  and the polyclonal antibody cross-reacted with mouse asp  <cit> . non-immune igg  was purchased from sigma . for the production of recombinant asp , the portion of the human c <dig> gene representing asp  was cloned into the ncoi/ecori restriction sites of pet32a . an extra alanine  codon was incorporated to be able to use ncoi as a cloning site. the vector was digested with ndei to excise out the thioredoxin tag  and religated to obtain pet_his_asp vector containing the his-tagged asp sequence. the cell line used to produce recombinant asp was origami b  , a bl <dig> derived cell line lacking thioredoxin and glutathione reductase genes. frozen orib-pet-his-asp scrapes were inoculated and grown overnight at 37°c with shaking  in bacterial media  supplemented with  <dig> ug/ml kanamycin  and  <dig> ug/ml carbenicillin . cultures were diluted  in bacterial media, incubated 5- <dig> hours  until an od <dig> of  <dig> - <dig>  was reached, then supplemented with iptg  and incubated overnight . cell pellets were collected , lysed with  <dig> ml bugbuster ,  <dig> mg lysozyme  and  <dig> μl benzonase nuclease , vortexed well, shaken  <dig> min at rt, centrifuged  and the supernatant decanted. the lysis step was repeated with an additional  <dig> ml, then  <dig> ml. all supernatants were pooled, acidifed with 10n hcl , stirred , centrifuged , pooled, adjusted to ph  <dig>  with  <dig> n naoh and centrifuged . rhis-asp was purified with binding to ni2+-sepharose column . following loading of rhis-asp, the column was washed with buffer  and eluted with acidified buffer . for removal of rhis-tag, rhis-asp solution was carefully adjusted to ph  <dig> , enterokinase  was added , and incubated overnight at rt  with gentle shaking. rasp was purified by hplc as previously described  <cit> .

in vitro fatty acid uptake
3t3-l <dig> preadipocytes cells were obtained from atcc . cells were routinely grown in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium  + 10%  fetal calf serum  at 37°c, 5% co <dig>  3t3-l <dig> preadipocytes were differentiated into mature adipocytes as described previously  <cit> . differentiated adipocytes in  <dig> well plates were preincubated  in serum free medium for  <dig> hour then incubated with pbs , insulin  , rasp , or rasp  + anti-asp  for  <dig> hour. uptake of fluorescently labeled fatty acids was measured over time in adipocytes as described  <cit>  using a qbt™ fatty acid uptake assay kit  as outlined by the manufacturer. following the addition of bodipy-fatty acid, fatty acid uptake is measured in real-time over  <dig> min in a bottom-reading fluorescent microplate reader.

mice
male c57bl/ <dig> mice  were purchased from charles river laboratories . the mice were maintained on a high-fat diet  throughout the study  and housed individually in a sterile barrier facility with a  <dig> h light:  <dig> h dark cycle. two weeks following the start of the high-fat diet regimen, the mice were surgically implanted with an osmotic mini-pump  . briefly, the mice were first sedated with ketopiofen  then anesthetized with isofluorane. under sterile conditions, a small incision was made between the skin and scapulae and the osmotic pump was inserted subcutaneously into the mouse. the incision was then closed with sutures according to manufacturer's instructions. all protocols were conducted in accordance with the cacc guidelines and approved by the university animal care committee. the mice were divided into four groups where they were continuously delivered; i) non-immune igg n =  <dig> ; ii) anti-asp n =  <dig> ; iii) pbs  n = 6; or iv) recombinant asp  in pbs n =  <dig> for  <dig> weeks at a flow rate of  <dig>  μl/hr. twenty-eight days following mini-pump insertion , mice were fasted overnight, euthanized, and tissues, blood samples and the mini-osmotic pumps were collected. average pump rate was calculated as the difference between the initial volume loaded and the residual volume divided by  <dig> days.

plasma measurements
overnight fasting plasma samples were taken  <dig> days after the surgery by submandibular bleed and during sacrifice by cardiac puncture . plasma human rasp levels were measured by an in-house elisa which does not cross-react with mouse asp, background non-specific  values were subtracted  <cit> . rabbit igg was measured by easy-titer igg assay kit , to track the efficacy of pump delivery. plasma tg , non-esterified fatty acids   and glucose  were measured using colorimetric enzymatic kits. insulin and adiponectin were measured using ria kits ; interleukin- <dig>   and crp  were measured by elisa. c <dig> was measured by immunoturbidimetric assay .

body weight, food intake and indirect calorimetry
body weight and food intake were measured  <dig> times a week. food intake results are reported as cumulative food intake in kcal. food efficiency was calculated as the food intake in kcal over body weight gain in grams. calorimetry measurements were taken 15- <dig> days after the surgery. oxygen consumption  and carbon dioxide production  were measured over a  <dig> hour period in an open circuit system after  <dig> hours equilibration as previously described  <cit> . vo <dig> and vco <dig> were calculated as ml/kg/min and rq  was taken as the quotient of vco2/vo <dig>  energy expenditure  was calculated as  <dig> vo2+ <dig> vco <dig> <cit> .

skeletal muscle ex vivo assays
quadriceps muscles were excised and placed into room temperature krebs-ringer buffer  containing 1% fatty acid free bsa and  <dig> mm glucose. for fatty acid oxidation, the muscle was cut into small pieces then incubated with  <dig> mm palmitic acid   in krb for  <dig> hours. oxidation was measured as the production of 3h2o into the aqueous phase following a folch extraction as previously described  <cit> . the organic extract was dried down in a speedvac, resuspended in  <dig> μl chloroform/methanol  and lipids were separated using silica thin layer chromatography plates. the extracted lipids were separated using heptane/isopropyl ether/acetic acid  as the separation solvent for  <dig> min. the plate was developed in iodine vapour and diglyceride and triglyceride bands were identified and scraped into scintillation vials for counting. following overnight solubilization of the tissue remnants in naoh, total proteins were measured by bradford assay . glucose oxidation was performed as previously described  <cit> .

substrate content and enzyme activity assays
liver glycogen was degraded into glycosyl units by incubating small liver pieces  in  <dig> m hcl at 100°c for  <dig> hours  <cit> . the extracts were neutralized with tris-koh and the supernatant was assayed for glucose using a commercial colorimetric kit . results are expressed as μmoles/g glycosyl units per liver weight. for glucose-6-phosphate measurements, small liver pieces  were homogenized in 6% perchloric acid. the supernatant was clarified by centrifugation and neutralized with koh in the presence of phenol red. the resulting potassium perchlorate precipitate was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was enzymatically assayed for glucose 6-phosphate by following nadph accumulation at  <dig> nm in presence of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. results are expressed as nmoles/g liver sample. neutral lipids were extracted from muscle and liver samples  in a heptane/isopropanol  solution overnight at 4°c. the next day organic extracts were assessed for tg content using a commercial colorimetric kit  and total protein content was measured as described above. results are expressed as μmoles of tg per gram of protein. glucokinase  enzyme activity was measured as previously described  <cit>  however; solution volumes were modified for a 96-well plate and ods were measured on a plate reader .

statistics
results are expressed as means ± sem. results were analyzed by two-way anova , one-way anova followed by dunnett's post-hoc test  or two-tail t-test . for indirect calorimetry measurements body weight and food intake, group and time p values are indicated in the graphs. average area-under the curve  was calculated for light  and dark  energy expenditure. significance was set as p value <  <dig> , where ns represents non-significant values. all graphs and statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism  <dig>  .

RESULTS
anti-asp blocks in vitro asp-stimulated fatty acid uptake
recombinant asp  activation and antibody neutralization were first tested in an in vitro system. insulin  and rasp significantly stimulated fatty acid uptake in murine adipocytes to a similar degree , with maximal stimulation of  <dig> ± 49%  for insulin and 243% ± 24%  for rasp, vs pbs set at 100%. this is also presented as a  <dig> -fold  increase for insulin and  <dig> -fold  increase for rasp in the incremental area-under-the-curve . the addition of increasing concentrations of anti-asp significantly reduced rasp stimulated fatty acid uptake to basal levels  .

monitoring exogenous antibody levels and plasma hormones
mice were treated by osmotic mini-pump for  <dig> weeks with neutralizing anti-asp or control non-immune igg . plasma samples were taken  <dig> days after implantation of the osmotic pump and at the end of the study to track the amount of antibody delivered into circulation. figure 2a shows that on day  <dig> rabbit ni-igg and anti-asp antibodies were detected . however, by the end, the levels of both ni-igg and anti-asp were greatly reduced . since there was no difference in osmotic mini-pump rate for pbs, rabbit antibodies or rasp treatments , reduced antibody levels may be attributed to enhanced antibody clearance. anti-asp blocking antibody treatment had no effect on mouse body weight , average food intake  or food efficiency , consistent with our previous report during a  <dig> day study  <cit> . there was also no difference in adipose tissue depots, liver or spleen weight between the two groups . il- <dig> levels were slightly but significantly elevated in anti-asp mice . however, crp levels, a marker of inflammation, were normal . anti-asp did not have an effect on fasting glucose levels after nine days of treatment . furthermore, there was no difference in plasma adiponectin, insulin, c <dig>  or lipid levels between the two groups at the end of the study .

values are presented as mean ± sem. no statistically significant difference was identified as determined by unpaired two-tail t-test.

anti-asp treatment results in increased energy expenditure and glucose oxidation
twenty-four hour energy expenditure was significantly elevated in anti-asp treated mice . analysis of dark and light 12-h cycles separately indicates a significant increase with anti-asp for both time periods . while rq increased with feeding , there was no change in rq in either dark or light cycles between the two groups, suggesting a whole body increase in both glucose and fatty acid oxidation . to investigate the mechanism of augmented whole body energy expenditure, we evaluated glucose and fatty acid consumption in skeletal muscle and liver. in the skeletal muscle, glucose oxidation was significantly increased more than two-fold in anti-asp treated mice . on the other hand, palmitate oxidation was reduced  with a shift of palmitate from oxidation towards incorporation into diglycerides  with no change in tg incorporation or total tg mass . in the liver, glycogen content was decreased by 34%  associated with a trend in reduced glucose-6-phosphate content  and no change in glucokinase  activity . also, there was no difference in liver tg mass .

nefa levels were reduced with recombinant asp treatment
next, we treated wt mice with human rasp for  <dig> weeks to enhance asp action. immunoreactive circulating human rasp was detected at ~ <dig>  pmol/ml on day  <dig> and remained constant until the end of the study period . interestingly, nefa levels were significantly lower in the rasp treated mice . fasting glucose levels were similar between rasp and pbs treated mice . in addition, no difference in plasma tg, insulin or adiponectin were detected between pbs and rasp treated mice, however c <dig> levels were significantly elevated in the rasp treated mice .

values are presented as mean ± sem where * p <  <dig>  as determined by unpaired two-tail t-test.

rasp treatment increases body weight and food intake in wt mice
monitoring of body weight during the treatment period indicated a significant increase in the rasp treated group within the middle time period of treatment . however, at the end, a similar final fasting body weight was measured . this increase in body weight was associated with a small but significant increase in cumulative food intake . food efficiency, calculated as food intake relative to body weight, was comparable between the groups . during this time period, energy expenditure was significantly reduced in rasp treated mice , in both the light and dark cycles . while respiratory quotient changes with feeding, there was no difference between the groups . analyses of ex vivo skeletal muscle oxidation revealed no change in glucose or palmitate oxidation for rasp and control mice . meanwhile, liver glycogen content was significantly increased by 59% in rasp treated mice  with no change in glucose-6-phophate or tg content .

discussion
the present study examines the effects of constant delivery of an asp-neutralizing antibody or rasp in high-fat diet fed mice. significant increases in energy expenditure and glucose oxidation coupled to reduced glycogen content were observed in anti-asp treated mice. in accordance with the randle cycle  <cit> , muscle fatty acid oxidation was suppressed while the glycolytic machinery was upregulated. on the other hand, rasp treated mice displayed reduced energy expenditure with increases in body weight , and increased food intake and liver glycogen content. therefore, anti-asp treatment increased whole body energy expenditure and glucose utilization in the muscle and decreased glucose storage in the liver while rasp treatment showed the opposing effects of decreased energy expenditure and increased liver glycogen.

some of the limitations of the study include the small sample number and the reduced antibody levels detected towards the end of the study. while in cultured mouse adipocytes, low anti-asp antibody levels were sufficient to neutralize asp-stimulated fatty acid uptake, the lack of body weight change between anti-asp and ni-igg treated mice at study end could potentially be explained by reduced neutralization capacity due to the low circulating antibody levels detected. therefore, in future studies, a longer lasting asp blocking function, such as might be obtained with fab fragments or antagonists, would be the ideal intervention tool.

elevated fasting plasma asp levels are often present in obesity and associated diseases and correlate with bmi as well as percent body fat . previous reports have shown that asp stimulates fatty acid trapping in white adipose tissue  <cit>  and adipocytes  <cit> , stimulating fatty acid uptake and esterification in both preadipocytes and mature adipocytes  <cit> . in the present study, rasp treatment reduced fasting plasma nefa levels, suggesting increased fatty acid uptake and storage. further we showed that exogenous rasp stimulated weight gain and food intake while decreasing energy expenditure in mice. consistent with these in vivo and in vitro effects, we hypothesize that asp may play a role in increased weight gain.

in our previous pilot study, we demonstrated that anti-asp significantly increased muscle and liver ampk activity as well as reducing muscle lpl activity  <cit> . while this was a short-term  daily injection study in low-fat diet fed mice, this study provided strong support for ongoing evaluation, and is consistent with our present study. in both the  <dig> day and  <dig> week studies, there was no change in food intake compared to control wt mice. in addition, anti-asp treatment in the two studies had no effect on metabolic hormones such as insulin or adiponectin levels. further, our previous pilot study suggested an increase in energy expenditure via an increase in ampk activity, a well known marker of a cell's "fuel gauge", indicating atp/amp availability  <cit> .  we directly demonstrate that in our present study of anti-asp treated mice. finally, anti-asp treatment does not promote liver lipotoxicity, as both studies showed no change in liver tg accumulation compared to controls.

as mentioned above, a significant outcome of blocking asp in wt mice was increased whole body energy expenditure, evaluated by indirect calorimetery. interestingly, c3ko mice on either a low-fat diet  <cit>  or a high-fat diet  <cit>  also displayed increased oxygen consumption, suggesting a role for asp in energy metabolism. however while c3ko mice demonstrated a decrease in rq , in the present anti-asp study, there was no change in rq, suggesting a comparable increase in both fat and glucose oxidation. one major site of energy utilization is muscle. on a high fat diet, c3ko mice demonstrated greater fatty acid oxidation vs wt mice  <cit> , while anti-asp mice demonstrate increased glucose oxidation vs wt mice in skeletal muscle. there are several factors that could explain this difference including length of time on a high-fat diet  or in utero compensatory mechanisms in c3ko mice. either way, energy expenditure is increased. an additional point of difference between c3ko and anti-asp treated mice is their food intake. c3ko mice are hyperphagic  <cit> , while there was no change in food intake in the present study. again, differences could be related to time of treatment . possibly, c3ko hyperphagia is centrally regulated as c5l <dig>  has been identified in the brain  <cit> . we speculate that peripherally administered anti-asp treatment had no effect on food intake, because of a lack of central targeting, since antibodies cannot cross the blood brain barrier, although this remains to be evaluated. in summary, asp neutralization effectively augmented energy expenditure without negatively affecting food intake.

it is interesting to note that the physiological results observed with either treatment are independent of changes in adiponectin, insulin and crp levels, however anti-asp treated mice did display slightly increased plasma il- <dig>  il- <dig> is a pro-inflammatory cytokine shown to influence glucose metabolism, however, its effects on insulin sensitivity remain controversial  <cit> . wernstedt et al. showed that il- <dig> ko mice had increased plasma asp levels prior to the development of their mature onset obesity, and il- <dig> injection rapidly reduced circulating asp levels  <cit> . there appears to be a reciprocal relationship between il- <dig> and asp levels although the exact nature of this regulation is unknown and warrants further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, enhancing asp action with the addition of recombinant asp resulted in increased body weight and food intake, supporting a direct role of increased asp in promoting obesity. furthermore, targeting asp decreased adipose tissue tg mass and lpl activity in our previous study  <cit>  and increased energy expenditure, oxygen consumption and muscle glucose oxidation in the present study. overall, anti-asp increased whole body energy utilization while rasp increases energy storage. therefore, asp may be a mediator of energy regulation. however, a direct role for asp in tissues that express its receptor c5l <dig>  such as muscle, liver and central nervous system  <cit> , remains to be determined.
