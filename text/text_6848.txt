BACKGROUND
the african buffalo  is the largest bovid species in the african savannah ecosystem. buffalo are of great ecological importance because of their role as bulk feeders in the grazing hierarchy. due to their size they are able to process taller and coarser grasses than most other species  <cit> , playing an important facilitative role for the smaller grazers  <cit> . they inhabit zones with almost all vegetation types, provided a permanent water source is present. in addition, they are an important prey species and have high economic value in the ecotourism and hunting industries  <cit> . the african buffalo also hosts a vast array of nematodes, pathogens and infectious diseases and plays an important role in the maintenance and transmission of economically important livestock diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease , bovine brucellosis, corridor disease and bovine tuberculosis   <cit> . for numerous other diseases, buffalo may act as amplifier or incidental hosts, as is the case with ehrlichiosis, rift valley fever and anthrax  <cit> . it is assumed that the african buffalo, unlike some domestic bovids , may exhibit partial resistance to some of these diseases, highlighting the importance of understanding the genetic mechanisms at work.

advances in methods for characterizing the genetic variation in individuals, populations and species have revolutionized ecological research. population genetic diversity, inbreeding, hybridization, species designations, dispersal patterns and evolutionary processes are just a few of the applications of genetic data in the conservation and management of wildlife  <cit> . one of the greatest challenges of working with non-model species is the lack of availability of genome variation data with which to design these studies  <cit> . the assembly of an accurate genome for important non-model study species provides an invaluable resource for research. complete and accurate reference genome information prevents the erroneous identification of polymorphisms, and misalignments  <cit> . in the absence of a complete reference genome, a related species can be used as a proxy reference to facilitate the identification of various single nucleotide variants , but the amount of sequence that can be accurately mapped may be insignificant  <cit> .

the identification of novel genetic variants in an important species such as the african buffalo may help to provide answers to numerous genetic and other research questions, including disease susceptibility, that have heretofore been unattainable  <cit> . previously, we aligned buffalo short reads obtained from high-throughput sequencing to the b. taurus genome assembly to facilitate snv discovery  <cit> . here, we present the first complete de novo assembled full-length genome for the african buffalo with an assembled n <dig> contig size reaching  <dig> kilobase pairs  and an n <dig> scaffold length of  <dig>  mb, which represents the first fully sequenced and de novo assembled sequence of the african buffalo. we carried out a number of additional analyses, including evolutionary analyses and genetic content. our results will significantly aid in understanding the genetics of the african buffalo and contribute to the fields of molecular ecology, population genetics and disease susceptibility, ultimately supporting conservation and management efforts.

RESULTS
twelve mate-pair libraries with different insert sizes were prepared using dna from a 2-year old male buffalo and sequenced to a high  coverage on an illumina hi-seq  <dig> and assembled de novo. following data filtration and the removal of low quality reads, a total of  <dig>  gbp of usable sequence  and an average read length of  <dig>  bp was obtained . the total length of the genome assembly equated to  <dig>  gbp and a total of  <dig> scaffold contigs made up 90% of the genome assembly and  <dig> % of the estimated length . it was estimated that the genome size of s. caffer is  <dig> mbp . a total of  <dig>  genes were predicted and of these a total of  <dig>  genes were annotated to s. caffer while a total of  <dig> genes could not be annotated . data analysis and annotation of the non-coding rna identified a large number of mirna and trna . the estimated heterozygosity ratio of the sequenced buffalo was  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  and we estimated  <dig> , <dig> heterozygous snvs.table  <dig> assembly and annotation of the s. caffer genome




to extend a detailed annotation, the s. caffer genome, gene clusters were constructed using twelve additional mammalian genomes . the s. caffer genome contains  <dig>  orthologous gene clusters and a total of  <dig> are shared among four species . a total of  <dig> predicted gene clusters are shared exclusively between s. caffer and b. taurus and  <dig> are unique to s. caffer . it was determined that the divergence time between s. caffer and b. taurus is  <dig> – <dig>  million years ago  .table  <dig> summary of gene families of s. caffer and twelve other mammalian genomes

to investigate signatures of selection we obtained a total of  <dig> 1: <dig> orthologous gene sets in s. caffer, b. taurus, c. ferus, o. aries, s. scrofa and t. truncates and this was based on the gene family results. finally, we inferred  <dig> genes which contain positive selected sites in buffalo. these include ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase  <dig> , interleukin  <dig>  and cyclin b . based on the comparison of orthologous gene families among the  <dig> mammalian species, the s. caffer genome has  <dig> expanded and  <dig> contracted gene families when compared to b. taurus as a common ancestor . the expanded genes were coupled to a large variety of go terms, including g-coupled protein and olfactory receptors.

discussion
the african buffalo has become a species of great interest in recent years because it serves as maintenance host for numerous infectious and zoonotic diseases such as fmd, corridor disease and bovine tuberculosis  <cit> . in addition, its high economic value in the ecotourism and trophy hunting industries make this species invaluable to game ranchers and breeders  <cit> . the african buffalo is one of only three main species of buffalo found in the world. the other two include the american bison  and the domesticated asiatic buffalo . reference genomes of  <dig>  gbp and  <dig>  gbp have been assemble d for these respectively, but are not publically available  <cit> . the bubalus bubalis genome was found to encode  <dig>  protein coding genes, which is comparable to the african buffalo genome we report here, which is  <dig>  gbp in size with a total of  <dig>  predicted protein coding genes and of these  <dig>  were annotated. moreover, the annotation of non-coding rna identified unexpectedly large numbers of mirna and trna  <cit> . the use of standard tools namely trnascanner se  as well as alignment using blast and infernal for de novo non-coding rna annotation consistently identified  <dig>  mirna genes. the large number is implausible , suggesting the need for improved prediction tools in some species including s. caffer.

although big game species such as the african lion, african elephant and the white rhino have been sequenced , the only suitable reference genome publically available for the alignment of african buffalo sequences was that of b. taurus  <cit> . s. caffer has  <dig> chromosomes  <cit>  compared to the  <dig> chromosomes found in b. taurus  <cit> . our analyses here estimated  <dig> , <dig> heterozygous snvs in the sequenced buffalo, compared to the  <dig> , <dig> heterozygous variants identified in the holstein b. taurus genome  <cit> . the african buffalo is not an antecedent of the cow and their most recent common ancestor is estimated to have existed approximately  <dig> -  <dig> mya, at the time of divergence of the sub-tribes bubalina, which is composed of the syncerus and bubalus genera and bovina, comprising the bos and bison genera  <cit> . in previous work, we determined that only  <dig> to 23% of the low coverage buffalo short reads mapped to the cow reference genome using bwa and bowtie, illustrating the need for a species-specific reference  <cit> .

we anticipate that the annotated african buffalo genome will facilitate our future genetic association studies of susceptibility to btb, which is a threat to conservation areas in south africa  <cit> . previously, we identified novel snvs by sanger sequencing conserved regions across species, a process that was time-consuming and often resulted in non-specific amplification  <cit> . alternatively, we had to rely on short reads mapped to an unsuitable reference genome  <cit> . it will now be possible to design species-specific primers for susceptibility genes of interest, based on the gene annotation completed here. low coverage genome sequencing of additional buffalo will allow us to establish a snv database, which would also be a resource for future population genetic and disease association studies  <cit> .

several of the genes that were substantially expanded and contracted in the african buffalo compared to other mammals are involved in immunity. this includes the contracted genes chemokine  ligand  <dig>  and complement component  <dig> alpha subunit  as well as the expanded genes t cell receptor gamma variable  <dig>  and killer immunoglobulin-like receptor kir3dl splice variant  <dig> . in total it is estimated that there are  <dig> genes involved in immune responses in the african buffalo and these are possible candidate genes to investigate in disease susceptibility studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the african buffalo genome offers unique insight into the phylogenetic history and adaptation of an ecologically important species. additionally, the availability of a complete reference genome allows for improved mapping of short reads, thereby aiding in novel snv discovery and future genetic studies.
