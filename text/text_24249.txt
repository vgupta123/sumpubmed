BACKGROUND
reactive oxygen species  are continuously being generated during oxygen dependent events in living organisms. ros production is highly correlated to pathological responses both at the cellular and organismal level  <cit> . these responses include events such as cancer, cell death and aging. at the cellular level the oxidative stress response results in activation and up regulation of several antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase , catalase and glutathione-s-transferase  as well as non-enzymatic antioxidant compounds, such as ascorbic acid, β-carotene and reduced glutathione, gsh  <cit> . the role of metallothionein  as a free radical scavenger has been well documented in vitro  <cit> , in cell lines  <cit> , and at the organism level  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that mt is induced by ros inducing agents such as paraquat , hydrogen peroxide  and glutathione depleting agents such as diethylmaleate  <cit> . in addition, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate  is a potent tumor promoter shown to induce mt expression via activator protein  <dig>  cis-acting elements in mammals  <cit> .

sequencing of several teleost mt enhancer regions have revealed the presence of distally located nuclear factor interleukin  <dig>  and ap <dig> elements, inferring that these elements are involved in a conserved function  <cit> . the transcription factor nf-il <dig> is activated by the cytokine il- <dig> in response to nf-κb activation. nf-il <dig> is suppressed in normal tissues, but is rapidly and drastically induced by inflammation  <cit> .

the composite transcription factor ap <dig> was first identified as a factor mediating optimal basal level expression of the human mt2a  enhancer region  <cit> . sequencing of the fugu genome allowed determination of gene similarity between human and teleost genomes  <cit> . it has been shown that there are more ap <dig> genes in fugu than in mammals and that they share high homology in the dna binding and dimerisation domains  <cit> . the sequence data thus indicate that the functionality of the ap <dig> proteins may be highly similar in both teleosts and mammals.

mt-i induction by ros in mouse has shown to be mediated by metal responsive elements  and antioxidant responsive elements /upstream stimulatory factor  cis-acting elements  <cit> . the usf/are composite transcription factor has also been identified in a number of other terrestrial vertebrates including chicken  <cit> . the usf cis-acting element has been shown to participate in basal level transcription of the mouse mt-i gene  <cit> . the are cis-acting element has also been identified and characterized in enhancer regions from metabolizing enzymes participating in the phase ii drug response and is activated by electrophilic xenobiotics and h2o <dig> <cit> . oxidative stress has been hypothesized to be the main driving force for gene activation via are  <cit> . however, it has been indicated that are driven gene expression can occur in the absence of oxidative stress through the transcription factor nuclear factor -like  <dig>   <cit> . the ap <dig> cis-acting element share high homology to the are but is not a component of the protein complex that binds the usf /are site on the mouse mt i enhancer region  <cit> . however, ap <dig> has been shown to bind to are in the nadp : quinone oxidoreductase hnqo <dig> gene enhancer resulting in activation of this gene  <cit> .

functional analysis of the rtmt-a promoter has indicated that free radicals regulate the rtmt-a gene via a region containing multiple copies of ap <dig> elements and one nf-il <dig> element  <cit> . in the rtmt-a gene there is a distal region of the promoter that contain ap <dig> elements with a potential to regulate mt gene expression. upstream of the ap <dig> elements there is one distinct nf-il <dig> element that has not been previously analyzed for its involvement in mt regulation. in studies of teleosts there is no clear correlation between the presence of ap <dig> elements and free radical responsiveness of the mt genes  <cit> . however, a study on the interaction between mt and free radicals indicate that rtmt-a and sea mussel  mt <dig> has a higher ros scavenging capacity than rabbit mt  <cit> . furthermore, in an open sea study on cod, a strong correlation was observed between hepatic mt levels and the total ros scavenging capacity of the liver  <cit> . thus, while ap <dig> has not been clearly correlated with mt induction in teleosts it remains that one of the functions of mt is ros regulation. to further explore the understanding of mt regulation in teleosts by ros and tumor promoting agents we have analyzed the relative contribution of ap <dig> and nf-il <dig> elements in the rtmt-a enhancer region. in order to study the conservation of the identified cis-elements we tested the regulatory potential using both homologous as well as heterologous systems. functional analysis of the rtmt-a promoter suggest that the nf-il- <dig> element is instrumental to mt induction by oxidative stress while the ap- <dig> elements exhibited a strong activation in response to tumor promoting agents such as pma. the ap- <dig> elements appeared only to a minor extent contribute to free radical inducibility of the rtmt-a gene. moreover, hepatic expression of rtmt-a mrna was substantially increased in response to both oxidative stress and tumor promotion, suggesting that mt may be involved in the protection against pathological processes such as inflammation and cancer.

RESULTS
basal level expression of the rtmt-a promoter
transfection of the indicated deletion constructs  in both homologous  and heterologous  systems show that the full-length rtmt-a promoter is required for maximal basal level expression . while single pairs  of ap <dig> elements did not initiate transcription, the region containing the complete cluster of ap <dig> elements  enhanced basal level activity 2-fold and 20-fold in the rth- <dig> and hep g <dig> cell lines respectively. the mre construct  was observed to be important for basal level activity of the rtmt-a promoter in both cell lines. transfection with the mre-ap <dig>  construct resulted in further enhancement of basal level expression.

rtmt-a activity following pq and h2o <dig> exposure
rth- <dig> and hep g <dig> cells were transfected with the mre-pgl <dig> vector , the mre-ap1-pgl <dig> vector , and the ap1-pgl <dig> vector . treatment of transiently transfected rth- <dig> cells with 10 μm pq  or 100 μm h2o <dig>  did not result in a significant increase in luciferase activity. however, transfection of hep g <dig> cells followed by 100 μm h2o <dig> exposure resulted in ~ <dig> -fold induction with both constructs containing the  <dig> ap <dig> elements . transfection with the mre-pgl <dig> vector did not result in up-regulation of the luciferase expression. these data suggest that the ap <dig> elements of the rtmt-a promoter alone confer free radical inducibility.

mutation analysis and emsa of rtmt-a ap <dig> elements
emsas were performed to identify relative binding affinity of the four ap <dig> elements  of the rtmt-a promoter to the ap <dig> consensus sequence. a set of normal and mutated ap <dig> oligonucleotides were used in emsa competition assays  ap <dig> sequences are presented in table 1). a strong gel-shift was observed following incubation with labeled ap <dig> consensus oligonucleotide with hela nuclear extracts. this shift was completely abolished by competing with 400-fold excess of either unlabeled ap <dig> consensus or ap <dig>  oligonucleotides . mutation of both proximal ap <dig> elements  abolished ap <dig> binding while separate mutation of the individual elements  resulted in reduced ap <dig> binding. thus, both ap <dig> and ap <dig> were observed to be important for interaction with the ap <dig> protein complex, with ap <dig> exhibiting strongest affinity. the distally located ap <dig> elements, ap <dig>  showed low binding affinity to the ap <dig> consensus sequence. however, using a  <dig> × molar excess of competitor a slight reduction in the intensity of the shift could be observed . dose–response competition of native and mutated ap <dig> * oligonucleotides  indicate that a  <dig> fold excess of consensus ap <dig> element completely competed away the labeled ap <dig> element. the ap <dig>  oligonucleotide was less effective and requires  <dig> fold excess for complete competition. the two single mutated sequences , also showed dose-dependent competition although requiring higher concentrations of competitor. mutation of both the proximally located ap <dig> elements  resulted in abolished competition with the ap <dig> consensus oligonucleotide. the present functional analysis of the rtmt-a ap <dig> elements demonstrates that the proximally located ap <dig> and ap <dig> elements show the highest competition with the ap1consensus sequence.

the different ap <dig>  and ap <dig>  oligonucleotides corresponds to position  and  of the rtmt-a promoter respectively. the asterisk  indicates a mutated cis-element.

in vitro inhibition of h2o <dig> induced rtmt-a gene activity
transfection of hep g <dig> cells with ap1-pgl <dig> and mre-ap1-pgl <dig> vectors resulted in a 2-fold, increase in luciferase activity following h2o <dig> exposure. the h2o <dig> induced luciferase activity in cells transfected with ap <dig> containing constructs was significantly reduced when co-incubated with synthetic double stranded ap <dig>  and ap <dig>  oligonucleotides, suggesting that the h2o <dig> induced gene activity was ap1-specific . the observed reduction in luciferase activity following oligonucleotide competition was strongest when transfecting with the ap1-pgl <dig> vector. moreover, as in the previous experiments, there was no up regulation following transfection of the mre-pgl <dig> vector alone . a decrease in luciferase activity was also observed in control cells co-incubated with competitor. however this decrease was small compared to the observed decrease in cells exposed to h2o <dig> 

activity of ap <dig> and nf-il <dig> elements in response to pq and pma
exposure of rth- <dig> cells to 10 μm pq resulted in a 6-fold increase in gene activity following transfection with the mre-ap1-nf-il6-pgl <dig> vector containing the distally located nf-il- <dig> element . transfection with the mre-ap1-pgl <dig> vector resulted in a modest increase in luciferase activity while the mre-pgl <dig> vector did not elicit an increased luciferase activity. the response to 10 μm pq was similar following transfection with the nf-il6-pgl <dig> vector , indicating that the nf-il <dig> enhancer mediated the observed pq inducibility. in contrast, transfection with the ap1-pgl <dig> vector and exposure to 10 μm pq did not result in an increased luciferase response, suggesting that the ap <dig> elements are not primarily involved in the pq response. on the other hand, exposure to  <dig> nm pma resulted in a robust induction  of luciferase activity following transfection with the ap1-pgl <dig> vector. the isolated nf-il- <dig> element was unresponsive to pma . thus, both the ap <dig> and the nf-il <dig> elements were functional in rainbow trout cells.

in vivo induction of mt-a mrna by pq and pma
rainbow trout were injected with 10 mg/kg pq and  <dig>  μg/kg pma in order to determine the effect on endogenous hepatic mt-a gene expression. a  <dig> - and a 2-fold induction of hepatic mt-a mrna was observed following exposure to pq and pma respectively , confirming that both inducers result in up regulation of rtmt-a mrna in vivo.

discussion
as a consequence of organism utilization of oxygen, deleterious reactive oxygen species are produced. these oxygen species may lead to lipid peroxidation, dna strand breaks and cell death. however, several antioxidant systems, such as gsh, sod, catalase and mt have evolved to protect the organism from oxidative stress. a wide variety of stresses, ranging from physical injury to oxidative stress, induce mt in animals  <cit> . although numerous studies have been performed to confirm mts antioxidative function, few have focused on the link between regulation of mt and a role during oxidative stress. in the present study we aimed to characterize the regulatory role of the rtmt-a enhancer region in response to oxidative stress and tumor promotion. previous identification and functional analysis of distal elements on the rtmt-a promoter have revealed that a cluster including  <dig> ap <dig> elements and a single nf-il- <dig> element may be involved in free radical inducibility  <cit> . while free radical regulation of mammalian mt genes seem to be mediated via usf/are and mre cis-acting elements  <cit> , teleost mt genes may be regulated via conserved clusters of cis-acting elements sharing high homology to the nf-il <dig> and the ap <dig> consensus core sequences  <cit> . functional analysis, from the present study, of the rtmt-a promoter suggest that the nf-il- <dig> element is instrumental to mt induction by oxidative stress , and the ap- <dig> elements may to a minor but significant extent contribute to free radical inducibility.

the observed absence of ros induced mre activation in the present study demonstrates that mt regulation in rainbow trout differ from that in mammals where the mre binding transcription factor mtf- <dig> is activated following oxidative stress  <cit> . since the mre elements identified on the rtmt-a promoter were not observed to contribute to the oxidative response this suggests that teleost mtf- <dig> is not activated by oxidative stress. characterization of mtf- <dig>  from zebrafish and rainbow trout has revealed a high conservation with regard to binding specificity and properties  <cit> . however, this study points out that there might be different mechanisms that regulate mt gene expression during oxidative stress in different species.

while usf/are and mtf- <dig> mediate oxidative mt expression in mammals, the ap <dig> cis-acting elements identified on the rtmta promoter, sharing high homology to the are core sequence, showed weak activation in response to oxidative stress. the ap <dig> cis-acting element was originally discovered on the hmtiia gene mediating optimal basal level expression of mt  <cit> . functional analysis of the identified rtmt-a elements strongly indicated that the ap <dig> elements were required for maximal basal level expression in both fish  and mammalian cell  systems. further analysis of binding affinity for the ap <dig> consensus sequence indicate that the proximal ap <dig> pair exhibited highest binding affinity, while the binding activity of the distal ap <dig> elements was at the border of detection limit. in addition, mutational analysis indicated that ap <dig> showed highest binding of the proximally located pair. hence, functional analysis of the identified ap <dig> elements suggests that ap <dig>  is functional with respect to both ap <dig> protein complex interaction and transactivation. however, there have been conflicting reports on the involvement of ap <dig> in the free radical regulation of mt in teleosts  <cit> . while a deletion construct containing mre and ap <dig> responded to ros in common carp  <cit> , the zebrafish mt gene promoter that contains both ap <dig> and mre elements did not respond to ros  <cit> . in the present study co-transfection of hep g <dig> cells with rtmt-a ap <dig> containing constructs with rtmt-a ap <dig> oligonucleotides abolished h2o <dig> induced promoter activity. these data suggest that the identified ap <dig> elements on the rtmt-a promoter in rainbow trout specifically mediate free radical mt inducibility. the primary role of the ap <dig> protein complex is as a modulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. it has been indicated that there is a link between proliferating human hepatic cells and high expression of mt protein  <cit> . exposure of rth- <dig> cells to the tumor promoter pma resulted in a strong activation of ap <dig> cis-elements in the present study. in vivo injection of rainbow trout with pma strongly induced hepatic rtmt-a mrna levels, confirming the functionality of the ap <dig> elements on the rtmt-a promoter. these data strengthen the view of mt as a modulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. in the teleost chse- <dig> cell line mt becomes progressively methylated during prolonged subculturing, coinciding with a decrease in mt expression and reduced cell proliferation  <cit> . it has been suggested that antioxidants such as ascorbate, α-tocopherol and β-carotene are inhibitory to differentiation  <cit> . mt has also been suggested to alter the cellular redox state  <cit> , indicating a role for mt during development and differentiation.

cellular responses following stress, such as injury, promote a transient activation of nf-il <dig> and ap <dig> protein that both play key roles in the initiation of inflammatory responses. nf-il <dig> is rapidly activated in response to cytokines and oxidative stress  <cit> . this is in support with the present study in the rth- <dig> cell line demonstrating that the nf-il <dig> element was substantially activated in response to pq but not to pma. nf-il <dig> sites are also present in the mt enhancer of other teleosts such as the crucian carp  <cit>  suggesting a conserved function of mt in response to inflammation where nf-il <dig> may mediate ros inducibility. studies have demonstrated that nf-il <dig> activity can be modulated following protein-protein interaction with the ap <dig> protein complex  <cit>  and nf-κb  <cit> . the observed minor increase in ap <dig> element activity following pq exposure may enhance mt expression to protect from oxidative stress in fish. rainbow trout cells respond to ros exposure by induction of mt, which result in cellular protection from ros toxicity  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown in a recent study on cod that there is a close correlation between the hepatic levels of ros and mt  <cit> . il <dig> and cxcl <dig> are two of the first inflammatory mediators expressed and contain cis-acting sites for both ap <dig> and nf-il <dig>  which indicate their crucial role in acute phase responses  <cit> . kanekiyo and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated that mt gene activation by zinc regulates macrophage colony stimulating factor , which in turn recruit and stimulate cytokine production by monocytes. mice with genetic deletions in the mt proteins have a significant reduction in inflammatory mediators, including tnfα, il <dig> and il1α, compared to wild type mice  <cit> . furthermore, growth hormone  was found to induce the expression of rtmt-a)  <cit> . gh treatment results in phosphorylation of nf-il <dig> and increases its transcriptional activity. this suggests that gh may be able to modulate mt regulation through nf-il <dig> signaling.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrates that the nf-il <dig> and ap <dig> cis-acting elements of the rtmt-a promoter are functionally active. while nf-il <dig> was instrumental for mt induction by oxidative stress, the ap <dig> elements was primarily and substantially activated in response to tumor promotion. since nf-il <dig> is a key component of initiation of inflammation it appears that mt may regulate this process by free radical scavenging. these data strengthens the idea of mt as an important regulator of proliferation and differentiation. in addition, there appears to be a complex interplay between nf-il <dig> and ap <dig> that needs to be addressed in future studies to understand the link between mt expression, inflammation, development and differentiation.
