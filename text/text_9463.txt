BACKGROUND
leptospirosis is one of the most significant bacterial zoonotic diseases. it is caused by pathogenic species of the genus leptospira and results in high mortality and morbidity  <cit> . rodents are the main reservoirs of spirochetes, and different species can function as maintenance hosts. humans are usually infected through contaminated water or direct contact with the infected urine or abortion fluids of rodents and livestock animals  <cit> . the most prevalent subtypes in cattle herds are leptospira borgpetersenii serovar hardjo and leptospira interrogans serovar hardjo. differences among these subtypes are related to the geographic areas of isolation, genomic patterns and pathogenic features  <cit> . hardjoprajitno isolates have been described in australia, the united states of america , the united kingdom, mexico, and canada  <cit> . in south america, this leptospira subtype was first reported in argentina  <cit> , and serological analyses showed a high prevalence of serogroup sejroe in livestock in brazil  <cit> .

the identification and characterization of new bacterial strains have enhanced epidemiological studies of disease and improved general knowledge of the isolates  <cit> . however, the leptospira genus presents a different taxonomic classification among the bacterial phyla, with both its serological and genetic features useful for phylogenetic identification  <cit> . leptospira spp. taxonomic classification involves genomic features and serological analyses and comprises approximately  <dig> serovars grouped into  <dig> serogroups and several species. in the clinical setting, microscopic agglutination testing  is the serologic method used for leptospirosis diagnosis. however, because this technique is difficult and laborious, new molecular approaches are relevant candidates for improvement of the classification of leptospira species isolates in routine samples.

bovine leptospirosis infections cause clinical conditions associated with reproductive failure, including abortion, mastitis and a reduction in milk production  <cit> . the pathogenic and clinical evolution of these infections could be associated with the leptospira subtype  <cit> . serological characteristics are based on differences in the structure of the exposed lipopolysaccharide , which is synthesized by proteins at the rfb locus . this locus was first identified in the l. interrogans serovar copenhageni  <cit> . subsequent studies reported that l. borgpetersenii serovar hardjo contained  <dig> open read frames  and serovar copenhageni contained  <dig> orfs inside the rfb locus  <cit> . an additional orf found in l. interrogans serovar hardjo was named orf <dig>  <cit> . previous analyses suggested that orf1-orf <dig> and orf21-orf <dig> of the rfb locus in l. interrogans serovar hardjo were acquired by lateral gene transfer from l. borgpetersenii serovar hardjo and that orf15-orf <dig> and orf23-orf <dig> were acquired by lateral gene transfer from l. interrogans serovar copenhageni  <cit> .

different methodologies have been applied in leptospira spp. genetic studies to improve the characterization of leptospirosis, including quantitative real-time pcr techniques, which have been used for diagnostic and taxonomic purposes and the comparative analysis of leptospira strains for epidemiological studies  <cit> . the determination of insertion sequences and copy numbers has also been used for molecular bacterial typing  <cit> . for instance, the is <dig> and is <dig> mobile elements, which are classified in the is3-like and is <dig> families, respectively, were more frequent in the genomes of the major pathogenic species leptospira interrogans and leptospira borgpetersenii, respectively .

in the present study, we describe three clinical strains of leptospira spp. from two leptospirosis outbreaks in livestock that occurred in the state of minas gerais, brazil, in  <dig> and  <dig>  to identify the isolates, we performed mat and applied genotyping approaches using housekeeping  and rfb locus  genes. furthermore, real-time quantitative pcr was performed to compare the relative copy numbers of is <dig> and is <dig> among the clinical and reference leptospiral strains. our data suggested that rfb loci  could be useful for serovar and serogroup identification and that mobile elements might indicate differences among leptospira strains.

methods
leptospira spp. reference strains
we used  <dig> leptospira strains belonging to leptospira interrogans and leptospira borgpetersenii for the genotyping analysis . the reference strains were obtained from the pan american health organization, argentina and the royal tropical institute, the netherland, holland, amsterdam. the leptospira spp. were cultured in liquid ellinghausen and mccullough  medium modified under aerobic conditions at 28 °c in the absence of light  <cit> .table  <dig> list of leptospira spp. reference strains

epidemiological characterization of leptospirosis outbreaks
blood and urine were collected from  <dig> and  <dig> animals, respectively, from two dairy farms in the state of minas gerais, brazil, where leptospirosis outbreaks in livestock occurred in may  <dig> and may  <dig>  all of the selected animals presented clinical signs compatible with leptospirosis, such as abortions, reduction in milk production and stillbirths  <cit> . the collected blood samples were submitted to mat  <cit> . we collected the urine of mat-positive animals to proceed with leptospira isolation.

microscopic agglutination test 
to confirm the leptospirosis diagnosis, mat was used to detect antibodies to leptospira according to the method of faine et al.  <cit> . mat was also used for serological bacterial typing of isolates according to the leptospirosis reference centre . live cultures of  <dig> leptospira spp. reference strains representing eight l. interrogans serogroups and four l. borgpetersenii serogroups  were used . the sera were screened at 1: <dig> dilutions and further diluted on a two-fold basis to determine the final titer. leptospira spp. interpretation based on the mat was performed by the identification of an agglutination index ≥50% per microscopic field at a given dilution, which was considered a positive reaction.

leptospira spp. isolation procedure
ten-fold serial dilutions of urine samples directly obtained from mat-positive farm animals were inoculated into tubes containing 5 ml of emjh medium supplemented with 10% bovine serum albumin and 5% rabbit serum. the cultures were incubated at 28 °c and examined weekly for 10 weeks using dark-field microscope  <cit> . five hamsters were inoculated intraperitoneally with 500 μl of positive culture. their kidneys were obtained 21 days after inoculation and cultured in emjh medium  <cit> . clinical isolates were typed with the monoclonal antibodies  f16c <dig> and f106c <dig>  which were specific for serogroup sejroe and serovar mini, respectively, in the agglutination reaction. the monoclonal antibodies were produced and screened at the royal tropical institute , amsterdam, the netherlands.

dna isolation, conventional pcr and gene sequencing
a total of  <dig> cells were collected by centrifugation at  <dig>  g and incubated overnight at 50 °c in 200 μl of lysis buffer  containing 100 μg/ml proteinase k. genomic dna was extracted by the phenol/chloroform method and precipitated with ethanol  <cit> .

pcr was performed with a total volume of 25 μl, including 200 μm dntps,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>  10 mm kcl, 10 mm tris-hcl,  <dig> pm of each primer, 20 ng of genomic dna and 500 u of taq polymerase. the primer sequences and the expected product sizes are shown in table  <dig>  the reaction mixtures were subjected to the following amplification protocol for all of the genes analyzed: 3 min at 95 °c, followed by 29 cycles consisting of 95 °c for 1 min, a target-specific annealing temperature for 1 min and 72 °c for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °c for 10 min . the pcr products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. the pcr products were sequenced using a bigdye  <dig>  terminator sequencing kit  and an abi prism  <dig> automated sequencer  <cit> .table  <dig> list of primers used for pcr detection, sequencing and qrt-pcr assays

real-time pcr
real-time pcr was performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing 50 ng of leptospira spp. genomic dna, 250 nm each of the forward and reverse primers, and 10 μl of 2× sybr green master mix . the primer sequences and melting temperatures are described in table  <dig>  all of the reactions were performed in triplicate and were run on an abi/prism  <dig> fast sequence detection system  under the following conditions: 98 °c for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °c for 15 s and annealing/elongation for 15 s at 56 °c. dna sequencing of the pcr products confirmed their specificity. the relative quantification of the is <dig> and is <dig> copy numbers was calculated by the 2−ΔΔct method  <cit>  using the secy gene as the endogenous control  <cit> . the reference strain l. interrogans serovar lai was used as the calibrator strain for the quantification of both is <dig> and is <dig>  a blast search using each primer pair was performed to determine the number of amplifiable regions in the genome. in this analysis, we determined the presence of seven and two regions amplifiable by the primer pairs designed for is <dig> and is <dig>  respectively.

molecular phylogenetic analysis
homologous sequences of each genomic region of interest in other leptospira spp. were retrieved from the genbank database through a blast search  <cit> . this search was performed on the ncbi web server  by submitting the nucleotide sequences obtained from our isolates as queries against the refseq_genomic and refseq_rna databases. the search was conducted in october  <dig>  then, we manually selected representative leptospira species and serovar sequences  from the blast results and conducted the phylogenetic analysis. the selected sequences together with the sequences obtained in this work were aligned using muscle  <cit>  implemented in mega  <dig>  <cit> . all of the phylogenetic trees in this work were inferred by the neighbor-joining method  implemented in mega  <dig>  <cit>  and visualized using figtree .

RESULTS
leptospirosis outbreaks from minas gerais were mainly caused by serovar hardjo subtype hardjoprajitno
the evaluation of the two leptospirosis outbreaks was performed using serological mat to identify the prevalent leptospira serogroups. a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> bovine serum samples from the first outbreak  and  <dig> out of  <dig> samples from the second outbreak were mat positive. serovar hardjo  showed a high positive reaction frequency [ <dig> samples  from the first outbreak and  <dig> samples  from the second outbreak, followed by wolffi , bratislava  and bataviae . a small number of samples from the two leptospirosis outbreak reacted with serovars canicola , hebdomadis , pyrogens  and pomona . analysis of the antibody titers showed that the highest titers at both farms were observed with serovar hardjo .

we isolated one leptospira strain from the urine samples of seropositive animals from the first outbreak, which was referred to as “norma”, and two strains from the second outbreak, which were referred to as “lagoa” and “bolivia”. the serological identification of these clinical isolates was assessed using two monoclonal antibodies  . for these analyses, mat was applied to evaluate the agglutination titers of the monoclonal antibodies and clinical samples. the mab f16c <dig> could distinguish leptospira from serogroup sejroe serovar sejroe from leptospira from serogroup sejroe serovar hardjo. the expected agglutination titer for serovar sejroe was  <dig> and for serovar hardjo was greater than  <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, mab f106c <dig> showed a positive agglutination titer only for serovar mini. the antibody analysis for all three isolates showed agglutination titers of  <dig> with mab f16c <dig> and negative agglutination with mab f106c <dig>  these results indicated that norma, bolivia and lagoa belonged to serogroup sejroe serovar hardjo.

phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rdna and secy gene sequences
because serovar hardjo was encountered in three leptospira species , we sequenced the 16s rdna and secy gene genomic regions of our isolates  and applied phylogenetic methods for each genomic region to classify them taxonomically into one of these species. the sequences obtained from our isolates were identical to one another in both cases ; thus, we sampled these sequences as one sample  in our phylogenetic analysis. in both phylogenetic trees  generated using the 16s rdna and secy sequences, all of the clinical isolates clustered together and were classified as l. interrogans . in the 16s rdna analysis, the cluster formed by l. interrogans serovars was supported by a low bootstrap value  due to the high sequence similarity between the l. interrogans and l. kirschneri samples . in contrast, the phylogenetic analysis of the secy gene showed well-supported branches clustering both l. interrogans  and l. kirschneri  species, as shown in fig.  <dig>  furthermore, the other leptospira species of serovar hardjo included in the analysis clustered together with their respective species in both phylogenetic trees. these results allowed us to identify our three isolates  as belonging to the l. interrogans species.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic trees of leptospira spp. using  16s rdna and  secy sequences. the nucleotide sequences were aligned using muscle, and the trees were generated using the neighbor-joining method . the clinical isolates from this work are indicated with arrows. leptospira strains of the hardjo serovar are indicated with arrowheads. circles at nodes reflect the bootstrap support. an ancestral node without a circle indicates a bootstrap value below 50%. the bootstrap values of the nodes that group l. interrogans or l. kirschneri are located on these nodes in rectangles. long branches are broken, and the real lengths are displayed on these branches in parenthesis. in both trees, orthologous sequences from leptonema illini dsm  <dig> were used as the outgroup




occurrence and molecular evolution of orf <dig> and orf <dig> of the rfb locus in leptospira spp.
the rfb locus is largely used for the identification of different leptospira serogroups. the orf <dig> sequences of the leptospira species of serovar hardjo were highly similar to one another, whereas orf <dig> was specific to l. interrogans serovar hardjo  <cit> . to further classify our clinical isolates taxonomically, these orfs were amplified by pcr. reference strains of the l. interrogans and l. borgpetersenii species  were used as the controls.

for orf <dig>  pcr amplification with the primers orf22– <dig> and orf22– <dig>  produced a primary 561-bp pcr product in samples with the genomic material of the l. interrogans serovars hardjo, hebdomadis, and mini, the l. borgpetersenii serovar tarassovi and the hardjo strain sponselee . following the pcr amplification assay, the full-length orf <dig> from all of the positive amplicons was sequenced. by retrieving orthologs of orf <dig> from other leptospira strains from the genbank database, we observed that almost all of the l. interrogans strains in the database had orf <dig> in their genomes. nevertheless, the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that some orf <dig> sequences from l. interrogans strains clustered together with the orf <dig> sequences from l. borgpetersenii, indicating that an orf <dig> replacement event occurred in these l. interrogans strains . the clinical isolates , l. interrogans strain brem  <dig>  and serovars bataviae , hebdomadis  and medanensis  are examples of l. interrogans strains that contained orf <dig> substitutions. our data also showed two clades for the l. kirschneri bacterial strains, which suggested that this orf had great potential for leptospiral molecular typing. the bootstrap values supporting the clade information from our clinical isolates and the retrieved sequences are shown in fig. 2b.fig.  <dig>

the occurrence of orf <dig> in our isolates and the reference leptospira strains was also characterized by pcr amplification and partial sequencing using the primer pair orf36– <dig> and orf36– <dig> . in this case, positive amplification was observed only in the clinical isolates norma, bolivia and lagoa and the reference strain oms, which belonged to l. interrogans serogroup sejroe serovar hardjo . dna sequencing and a blast search for similar sequences in the refseq genomic database also indicated the specificity of orf <dig> to the hardjoprajitno subtype. the blast search retrieved a single genome accession with high identity  from l. interrogans strain brem  <dig> . the other leptospira genome accessions retrieved by the blast algorithm were from l. borgpetersenii , l. kirschneri , l. weilii , l. santarosai , l. inadai  and l. kmetyi , but their identities with the query were 74% . despite the phylogenetic proximity of the l. interrogans and l. kirschneri species demonstrated in the 16s rdna and secy gene sequences by the phylogenetic analysis , the tree topology generated from orf <dig> split the sequences from l. interrogans close to the root instead of clustering them together with the sequences from l. kirschneri. this finding could be an indication of gene acquisition by lateral gene transfer in these l. interrogans strains. however, we could also hypothesize that orf <dig> underwent several mutation events and acquired a novel function while other l. interrogans strains lost this orf.fig.  <dig>

insertion sequence copy numbers in leptospira interrogans serovars
studies of is <dig> and is <dig> using the hybridization technique have suggested that the copy numbers of these mobile elements can be used as a tool for epidemiological purposes in strains classified as l. interrogans and l. borgpetersenii, respectively  <cit> . in this study, we used quantitative real-time pcr to estimate and compare the copy numbers of the is <dig> and is <dig> insertion sequences in the l. interrogans strains classified as serovar hardjo to enhance the molecular characterization of these clinical isolates. for copy number calibration, we used the l. interrogans serovar lai strain  <dig>  genome  and determined the number of amplifiable regions for each primer pair via sequence similarity analysis using the blast algorithm. these analyses determined that serovar lai had seven and two amplifiable regions in its genome using the primer pairs for is <dig> and is <dig>  respectively .

for is <dig>  leptospira strains belonging to serogroup sejroe  showed higher copy numbers  than the other two serogroups . in serogroup sejroe, strains belonging to serovar hardjo  showed large variations in their copy numbers . our results determined the existence of at least ten copies for strain norma,  <dig> for strain bolivia,  <dig> for strain lagoa and  <dig> for reference strain oms. the sample from serovar wolffi showed a copy number comparable to the lagoa strain, with  <dig> copies. in the other l. interrogans isolates, we identified  <dig> copies in the copenhageni strain and  <dig> copies in the pomona strain .fig.  <dig> copy number quantification of  is <dig> and  is <dig> by qrt-pcr in the leptospira isolate and reference strain genomes. bars represent the mean values of three replicates . is copy number inference in other leptospira spp. samples was performed using secy as the endogenous control and svr. lai as the calibrator 




in contrast to is <dig>  the is <dig> mobile element analysis demonstrated little variation in the copy numbers. in serovar hardjo, at least three copies were present in bolivia and two copies in lagoa, norma and the reference strain oms. of the other l. interrogans strains, at least three copies were present in serovar wolffi, one copy in serovar copenhageni and no copies in serovar pomona. the standard deviation represented the ct value analysis from three independent experiments, as show in fig.  <dig> 

to check the consistency of our results, we also retrieved the genome sequence of l. interrogans serovar copenhageni from the genbank database  and verified whether the copy number obtained by each primer pair determined by real-time pcr in this serovar matched the number of amplifiable regions determined in silico by the blast search. we identified seven amplifiable regions using the is <dig> primer pair as the queries and a single amplifiable region using the is <dig> primer pair as the queries . these results corroborated the results obtained from the real-time pcr analysis.

discussion
mat is considered the standard serological test for leptospirosis diagnosis, but cross-reactivity frequently occurs, which raises questions concerning correct serovar identification  <cit> . although the isolation of leptospira spp. from infected animals or patients and molecular characterization are accurate diagnostic procedures for the taxonomic and serovar identification of a leptospira strain, these procedures are laborious and expensive.

another issue with leptospirosis serovars is that their classification based on genomic regions often does not correspond to their classification based on serological analysis  <cit> . this lack of correspondence prevents serological correlations because the genomic regions selected for the analysis represent ribosomal regions and housekeeping genes. to overcome this limitation, approaches based on molecular biology techniques, including restriction fragment length polymorphism  analysis  <cit>  and multiple locus sequence typing , have been proposed to render the serovar identification procedure more rapid and less expensive. additionally, pcr-based approaches using variable number tandem repeats  and the rfb locus  <cit>  have demonstrated promise in distinguishing leptospira serovars. here, we characterized two leptospirosis outbreaks at dairy farms in the state of minas gerais, brazil, using a conventional serological analysis  in combination with molecular biology approaches.

serological analysis using mat in a total of  <dig> animals from two dairy farms in the state of minas gerais determined that approximately half of the animals were seropositive and that hardjo was the prevalent serovar. we also observed cross-reactivity between the hardjo and wolffi serovars, which could be explained by both serovars belonging to the sejroe serogroup  <cit> . previous bovine leptospirosis epidemiological studies of livestock from different brazilian regions have also shown the seroprevalence of the hardjo serovar  <cit> , demonstrating a high incidence of this serovar in leptospirosis outbreaks in brazil.

the three clinical isolates obtained in this work  were classified as the sejroe serogroup by the monoclonal antibody analysis and as l. interrogans species by the phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rdna and secy gene sequences. we also achieved a more detailed taxonomic classification by analyzing orf <dig> and orf <dig> of the rfb locus. all of the clinical isolates contained an orf <dig> with high similarity to the reference strain hardjoprajitno and positive amplification of orf <dig>  which is a specific orf encountered in l. interrogans serovar hardjo. due to the high specificity of these molecular markers for subtype hardjoprajitno, we classified all of the clinical isolates as belonging to leptospira interrogans serogroup sejroe serovar hardjo based on the serological and molecular data.

the rfb locus was previously described in different works as a genomic region acquired by leptospira spp. from lateral gene transfer. thus, we presume that differences can occur among bacterial strains, especially in microorganisms isolated from different geographical areas and from different hosts.

previous studies have described sequence dissimilarities in some orfs of the rfb locus between l. interrogans serovar copenhageni and l. interrogans serovar hardjo, including orf <dig> and orf <dig>  <cit> . in the pcr analysis, amplification using our primers for orf <dig> was observed in serovars classified in the serogroups sejroe, hebdomadis, mini and tarassovi. conversely, the lai, copenhageni and canicola serovars were negative in this analysis. using sequencing and phylogenetic methods, we observed that the pcr-positive serovars were clustered in a branch with the l. interrogans and l. borgpetersenii species. although the lai, copenhageni and canicola serovars were pcr-negative for our primers, orf <dig> was present in their genomes and clustered in another branch with only the l. interrogans species . the tree topology clearly demonstrated a lateral gene transfer event in which the orf from l. borgpetersenii replaced the orf <dig> of some l. interrogans species. the phylogenetic tree also showed a close relationship between the orf <dig> sequences from our isolates from serogroup sejroe serovar medanensi and the hebdomadis and mini serogroups. historically, the hebdomadis, mini and sejroe serogroups belonged to the same serogroup  and displayed a similar antigenic profile  <cit> . our data from the orf <dig> analysis were in disagreement with previous studies related to the rfb locus in l. interrogans serovar hardjo because our isolates were similar to l. interrogans serovar hebdomadis. this finding suggested that orf <dig> might play an important role in shaping the antigenic profiles of these serogroups because they had the same origin.

orf <dig> was previously described as an extra orf present in l. interrogans serovar hardjo  <cit> . pcr analysis of this orf demonstrated positive amplification only in the l. interrogans serovar hardjo reference strain and our clinical isolates , as show in fig. 3a. to evaluate the distribution of the orf <dig> sequence throughout the available leptospira genomes, we queried this orf against the ncbi genome database. this query retrieved a single strain of the l. interrogans species with high similarity  and other leptospira species with low similarity, including l. borgpetersenii, l. kirschneri, l. weilii, l. santarosai, l. inadai and l. kmetyi . in the phylogenetic analysis, the tree topology generated by the orf <dig> sequences was contrasted with the topologies generated by the 16s rdna and secy sequences when we compared the closeness between the l. interrogans and l. kirschneri samples, which again suggested an evolutionary event that escaped the neutral models. orf <dig> was likely deleted early in the l. interrogans lineage and was acquired later by horizontal gene transfer in some species. we could also hypothesize that this orf was subfunctionalized and deleted in almost all of the l. interrogans serovars, whereas the other serovars neofunctionalized orf <dig> and maintained it in their genomes. here, our analyses are in agreement with previous discussions of the rfb locus and indicate that this orf may be unique to l. interrogans serovar hardjo strains. we also emphasize the high similarity between the orf <dig> and orf <dig> sequences of our clinical isolates and l. interrogans strain brem  <dig>  the latter strain was isolated in germany from horses and was classified in the sejroe serogroup but had no serovar classification. based on our analysis, we suggest that strain brem  <dig> also belongs to the hardjo serovar, but this suggestion requires serological analysis for confirmation. here, we designed primers to search for the genomic regions described in a previous work  <cit>  that discussed l. interrogans serovar hardjo and showed that this bacterial type had the rfb locus obtained from l. interrogans serovar copenhageni and l. borgpetersenii serovar hardjobovis. in this work, we searched for this information in our isolates because a comparison of bacterial strains obtained from different geographic regions worldwide could reveal different genomics features. we designed primers for these regions, sequenced these specific regions and compared the sequences with the available data. our analysis showed that orf <dig> in our isolates was similar to orf <dig> in l. interrogans serovar hebdomadis, which differed from the data described by de la peña et al., and that orf <dig> could be found in other l. interrogans serovars. previous works related to the rfb locus theme mentioned that this genomic region was acquired from bacteria classified in this genus. based on these statements, we attempted to verify the presence of these genes in our isolates.

next, we performed an is analysis of the leptospira reference strains and our samples. in this bacterial phylum, mobile elements represent an important region that is directly involved in genomic diversity among microorganisms  <cit> . moreover, information about is copy numbers in the genome has been demonstrated to be useful in epidemiological studies of the leptospira genus  <cit> . we found considerable variation in the copy numbers among the serovars and even among isolates of the same serovar, which allowed us to identify each strain by the is copy number profile  <cit> . one methodology used to determine the is copy number is southern blotting using is fragments as probes  <cit> . here, we recommend quantitative real-time pcr as an alternative to determine the copy number of a mobile element with greater precision. we selected the insertion sequences is <dig> and is <dig>  which are used for the taxonomic and serovar classification of l. interrogans and l. borgpetersenii, respectively  <cit> . the copy number estimations determined here were shown to be consistent, with the number determined in the copenhageni strain almost the same as the number determined by the in silico analysis using the genome sequence of this strain.

the quantitative pcr assays for is <dig> demonstrated significant copy number variation among the l. interrogans serovars  and even among our clinical isolates . from these results, we classified the samples containing more is <dig> copies as belonging to the sejroe serogroup and the samples with seven or six copies as belonging to the icterohaemorrhagiae or pomona serogroups. experiments with more samples are needed to determine how well the quantification of is <dig> can distinguish among l. interrogans serovars or serogroups, but the large variation in the is <dig> copy number and good precision of the method in determining the copy number are indicative of its potential for epidemiological studies. is <dig> is well distributed in the l. borgpetersenii genome and can reach almost one hundred copies; in contrast, this mobile element is present in l. interrogans at a low copy number, as indicated in previous studies. our results showed a low number and variation of is <dig> among the sampled l. interrogans serovars , suggesting that the transference and recombination of genetic material between the two species occurred in punctual regions of the l. interrogans genome and might not have interfered with its is <dig> copy number. moreover, the difference in the is contents of the lagoa and bolivia strains isolated at the same time represent clear genetic variability that suggests the co-circulation of different strains during an outbreak.


leptospira spp. identification is an essential procedure to aid in the selection of the best means to control the disease. in this work, we endorse the importance of molecular characterization for the identification of leptospira spp. by analyzing orf <dig> and orf <dig> from the rfb locus and the copy numbers of mobile elements . phylogenetic analysis based on rfb locus genes suggested the great potential of this region for the generation of taxonomic information. is analysis also helps address other questions concerning the genomic organization of leptospira strains because differences in copy numbers may be associated with genetic rearrangements and pseudo-gene formation. finally, we succeeded in isolating three leptospira samples from livestock from the state of minas gerais, brazil, which were classified as l. interrogans serogroup sejroe serovar hardjo. therefore, this study enhanced epidemiological research and suggested different vaccine formulations to contribute to bovine leptospirosis control in this endemic region. research to analyze distinct genomic features among leptospira spp. using molecular approaches and bioinformatics studies should be undertaken to improve our knowledge of their pathogenicity, evolution and epidemiology.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study described the occurrence of l. interrogans serovar hardjo subtype hardjoprajitno in livestock production through the isolation of bacterial strains. partial genetic analysis using rfb locus genes  suggested that these genes could be useful for taxonomic studies. genetic comparative analyses among leptospira spp. propose differences among clinical strains, which may contribute to new studies within these microorganisms. moreover, this work may improve knowledge about the most prevalent serovar in brazilian herds of cattle. an efficient vaccine should contain local isolates, and periodic molecular analysis of circulating isolates may contribute to the identification of important genetic variants that should be included in new vaccine formulations for leptospirosis control.
