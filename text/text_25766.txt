BACKGROUND
the caribbean has been an important model system for studying biotic over-water dispersal from continents and island colonization  <cit> , as well as vicariance  <cit>  as mechanisms for the origin of diversity, and within-island diversification as mediators of species richness and endemism  <cit> . the geological evolution of the region has certainly had a strong influence on the diversification of species there, and a general understanding of the former is crucial to an understanding of the latter.

the larger islands of the greater antilles  were repeatedly submerged until the mid/late eocene   <cit> . a general terrene uplift is likely to have occurred during the mid-eocene and the early oligocene , and some authors hypothesized the existence of a land corridor connecting northern south america to the greater antilles and subaerial aves ridge   <cit> , although this is still under debate  <cit> . hispaniola and puerto rico were physically connected until the formation of the mona passage, becoming fully separated during the late oligocene to early miocene   <cit> . later, during the early to mid-miocene, the aerial connection between eastern cuba and northern hispaniola was interrupted by the expansion of the windward passage   <cit> .

northern and southern hispaniola paleoislands collided in the mid miocene   <cit> , triggering the initial uplift of south-western hispaniolan mountains as well as the significant elevation of the cordillera central  <cit> . multiple marine incursions in the cul-de-sac/enriquillo depression repeatedly separated northern and southern paleoislands until the plio-pleistocene   <cit> . cuba was fragmented into distinct land blocks comprising the current western, central and eastern parts of the island until the late miocene, when the closure of the havana-matanzas channel began some 8–6 ma  <cit> . on the other side, jamaica was continuously submerged until ca. 12 ma  <cit> . the western jamaica land block was temporally aerial and connected to central america during the early to mid-eocene  <cit> , whereas eastern jamaica  was apparently connected to gaarlandia through the southern peninsula of hispaniola during ~35-33 ma  <cit> . most bahamian shallows and keys were repeatedly submerged during the pliocene and pleistocene   <cit> .

the butterfly genus calisto  is the only satyrine group occurring in the caribbean region  <cit> . this genus exhibits remarkable radiation and significantly contributes to the high butterfly endemism seen in the region  <cit> . the genus calisto comprises  <dig> described species, all geographically restricted to single islands  <cit> ;  <dig> distributed in cuba,  <dig> in puerto rico,  <dig> in anegada island,  <dig> in jamaica,  <dig> in the bahamas and the remaining  <dig> species occurring in hispaniola. molecular data has given insight into the cryptic condition of several taxa in hispaniola  <cit> , as well as assisted in determining the phylogenetic relationships of cuban taxa  <cit> .

even though the monophyly of the genus appears to be clear  <cit> , its position within the taxonomic tribe satyrini has not been resolved. morphological studies classify calisto within the subtribe pronophilina  <cit> , closely related to the neotropical genus eretris  <cit> . however, this has not been corroborated at the molecular level  <cit> . certain morphological similarities have even led some authors to propose african affinities with, for instance, the subtribe ypthimina   <cit>  and the satyrine tribe dirini  <cit> .

regardless of the phylogenetic position of calisto, a continental origin of the genus is the most plausible explanation, as no other extant satyrine butterflies with the potential of being a closely related group are found in the greater antilles; thus, its ancestors would have necessarily arrived to the caribbean from the nearby american continent  <cit> . once calisto colonized the greater antilles, further differentiation by vicariance  <cit> , within-island diversification  <cit>  or adaptive radiation  <cit>  might have shaped the evolution of these butterflies.

in this study, we aim to elucidate the phylogenetic affinities and to identify the main drivers of the diversification and distribution of calisto by using a secondarily calibrated molecular phylogeny. we also aim to reconstruct the historical biogeography of calisto and to evaluate possible changes in diversification rates throughout the evolution of the genus. intra-island differentiation appears to be an important factor for the radiation of these butterflies, a phenomenon observed in other caribbean animal lineages  <cit> . however, even though rapid diversification driven by ecological evolution is plausible explanation considering the diversity of caribbean habitats, niche saturation and island size may have imposed diversification limits  <cit>  which could have restricted the diversity and geographical distribution of calisto.

calisto nubila split early in the evolution of the genus, becoming an old and separate entity. the lineage did not apparently diversify further within puerto rico, although c. anegadensis on anegada island might have been derived from it based on morphological similarities  <cit> . three main monophyletic groups from hispaniola are identified: the lyceius-, the confusa-hysius and the chrysaoros clades. calisto zangis from jamaica is likely to have had hispaniolan ancestors as it belongs to the “lyceius clade”. the monophyletic group consisting of cuban and bahamian calisto is closely related to hispaniolan lineages such as c. arcas and the “chrysaoros clade”, although the relationship among them was not resolved with strong support . a revised checklist of the genus calisto is presented in table  <dig> figure  <dig>

each island and its fauna is shown according to the phylogenetic relationships presented in this study. hispaniola is subdivided in northern and southern paleoislands. the eight species that were not included in this work are listed with their putative sister taxa.



the genus calisto was not recovered within any valid satyrini subtribes. instead, our beast reconstructions place it sister to all sampled subtribes except euptychiina with low support values  . the exclusion of the genus euptychia  only increases the support for such a placement to moderate values . using birth-death/yule and normal/uniform as tree processes and calibration distributions respectively does not result in any significant difference in both tree topology and estimated ages . height posterior distributions displayed normally whereas summarizing the trees as means or medians height showed no significant difference. the crown age of calisto is inferred at 31 ma  in all cases except when yule process and the calibration normal distribution are used together, in which case the estimate is at 33 ma .

historical biogeography reconstruction
there was no statistical difference in the global likelihood between the non-time-stratified analyses ns <dig> and ns <dig> . excluding unlikely area connections , resulted in a puerto rico-northern hispaniola  distribution on the crown node of calisto, whereas ns <dig> equally preferred pr along with both nh and sh  . similarly, ns <dig> and ns <dig> were unable to discern between dispersal and vicariance for the origin of cuban calisto. the time-stratified analysis ts <dig> favoured vicariance over dispersal in all cases and ts <dig> inferred a pr-sh origin of calisto and vicariance for the origin of cuban diversity. however, ts <dig> analysis did not improve the global likelihood of the inference over ts <dig>  root optimizations significantly favoured a pr-sh distribution and vicariance as the cause of the cuban clade split from its sister hispaniolan lineages.table  <dig>

geological history of the greater antilles and bahamas and the evolution of
calisto.
a) the crown node of extant calisto occurred in the late oligocene, and the split of puerto rico and hispaniola coincided with the divergence of both faunas. b) in the middle miocene, hispaniola and cuba were physically separated, promoting the isolation of lineages on both islands. c) the creation of new niche space in hispaniola and cuba triggered the radiation of calisto by the mid/late miocene; cuban land blocks were unified and hispaniolan mountain ranges were rapidly uplifted during the late miocene. d) temporal isolation/connection of areas within each island during the glacial/interglacial cycles of the pleistocene. e) present-day greater antilles coded and coloured as our biogeographical analyses. maps were modified from  <cit> . area connectivity and dispersal rates used in our biogeographical analyses are shown below each time period . upper-right of each table  are area-adjacency values as used in biogeobears and values in  were used in lagrange c++. dispersal probability, as used in ts analyses, are displayed below on each table. ld is long-distance dispersal including one extra area. values of  <dig>  were assigned to ld involving more than one water barrier and extra areas.



the estimation of the parameter j  significantly improved the dec models. the global likelihood of ts <dig> was improved using biogeobears because, in contrast to lagrange c++, we were able to constrain the area-connectivity through time slices. ns1-j preferred dispersal in critical nodes, i.e. the colonization of jamaica, cuba and the bahamas, as well as a widespread origin of calisto  followed by vicariance. however, from all four models used in biogeobears, akaike weights and likelihood-ratio test  suggested that ts1-j had a higher probability of being the best model, followed by ts <dig>  dispersal to jamaica and the bahamas are fully recovered in both ts <dig> and ts1-j from biogeobears, whereas vicariance is favoured as an explanation of the origin of cuban calisto only in ts <dig> analysis.

diversification processes within calisto
the Δaicrc critical value for small phylogenies, as estimated in laser, is  <dig>  <cit> . the observed value for calisto is significantly higher than this threshold , favouring a rate-variable diversification model. however, there was no statistical difference between the rate-variable models yule-3-rates  and the logistic density-dependent  . the diversification of the main calisto tree excluding the cuban lineage also fits the rate-variable process  better, but there was not strong preference among ddl, yule- <dig>  and −3-rates  .table  <dig>

the best models for our data is either ddl or yule-3-rates, which are highlighted in bold text and with an asterisk . both models, nonetheless, predict a decreasing in diversification rates through time. excluding the cuban clade resulted in ddl, yule- <dig> or yule-3-rates as the main processes for the diversification of hispaniolan lineages. lh: the best recovered log-likelihood, r
i: net diversification rate at time i , a: extinction fraction , x: parameter controlling the magnitude of rates , k: parameter analogous to species “carrying capacity” , t_shifti: diversification shift at time i. the diversification models are pure-birth , birth-death , density-dependent speciation rate model following exponential  or logistic variants , exponential decline of speciation with constant extinction , exponential increase of extinction with constant speciation , speciation and extinction changes through time , and pure birth models with n shifts in speciation .



from all rate-variable models in ddd, only those with a whole calisto shift under diversity-dependent process are preferred with akaike weights higher than  <dig> . one single shift in the k parameter  at 14 ma fits 2– <dig> times better than shifts in k along with speciation or extinction rates. the decoupling of parameters for the cuban taxa alone from the main calisto tree was not enough to explain the radiation of the genus. cuban and hispaniolan taxa analyzed separately did not have constant diversification rates; rates changed possibly due to increased speciation, diversity-dependence processes, or a combination of both . including the number of missing taxa into the models when possible did not affect the recovered estimations .table  <dig>

the best models for each type of analyses, which include extinction and diversity-dependent processes, are highlighted in bold text and with an asterisk . λ is speciation rate, μ is extinction rate, k is species “carrying capacity” or a parameter analogous to it only in ddl. the estimated parameters to the right were calculated accounting missing taxa . the ddl model is not able to incorporate missing taxa whereas the cuban clade in this study included all described species. a shift in k is recovered as the best explanation for the diversification patterns of calisto and the hispaniolan lineages. yule-2-rate or a shift in k and μ are the best models to explain the diversification of the cuban clade alone.



discussion
colonization of the greater antilles by calisto
the variability in our dataset  is similar to previous inter-generic studies in nymphalidae  <cit> , but relatively higher than intra-generic studies  <cit> . the genus calisto is most likely a “relict” satyrine group that might have colonized the greater antilles during the uplift of gaarlandia   <cit> . our dating estimates, indeed, confirm that it is an old and independent lineage, and its crown age  provides evidence in support of the gaarlandia origin. previous attempts to date the diversification of calisto were done based only on a pairwise substitution rate for mitochondrial evolution  <cit> . this latter study deduced younger ages  but did not actually carry out a timing of the divergence analysis, rather they only calculated pairwise genetic distances with kimura 2-parameter without an adequate model testing.

it is not the first time that gaarlandia is invoked to explain butterfly geographic range expansion. it is the case for the nymphaline subtribe phyciodina  <cit> , the satyrine subtribe pronophilina  <cit> , and certain lineages within the papilionid tribe troidini  <cit> . the idea of indirect over-water dispersal by “hitch hiking” on hurricanes or flotsams rafts seems unlikely. adult butterflies respond to incoming bad weather by taking refuge  <cit>  whereas a high mortality of eggs, larvae and pupae is observed when they are exposed to marine water  <cit> . calisto, when compared to most other butterflies, are rather sedentary, and hence the direct and indirect dispersal capabilities of calisto make a dispersalist model less likely.

according to iturralde-vinent’s vicariance model  <cit> , after gaarlandia, hispaniola and puerto rico split around 20–30 ma, whereas in our study, extant calisto species in both islands have their most recent common ancestor at 27 ± 5 ma. furthermore, the cuban clade branched off from a hispaniola lineage at 21 ± 4 ma, but did not apparently diversify into any extant calisto until 14 ± 3 ma, while the last aerial connection between blocks of hispaniola and cuba existed until 14–17 ma. therefore, the evolution of calisto is better explained by the main predictions of the caribbean paleogeographical model of colonization rather than the stochastic dispersalist scenario.

the inclusion of jamaica into the vicariance model is less supported by the paleogeographical reconstructions, although a remote connection between the blue mountains block with gaarlandia has not been discarded  <cit> . the sole extant jamaican calisto split from its hispaniolan sister taxa at 14 ± 4 ma. at that time, large portions of jamaica began to uplift and the entire island remained above water afterwards, and hence the colonization of jamaica by rare long-distance dispersal events is the most likely explanation for the origin of the endemic sole species found there, calisto zangis.

historical biogeography of calisto
biogeographical reconstructions were significantly improved when we constrained dispersal probability and area-connectivity following the paleogeographic history of the caribbean. moreover, we found for the first time, statistical support for long-distance dispersal in the colonization of the bahamas and jamaica by estimating a founder-event parameter using a more general dec model. vicariance was recovered as the main explanation for the first diversification event of calisto, although we did not find a fully supported dispersal/vicariance origin for the cuban clade. whereas ns <dig> and ts <dig> in biogeobears and ts <dig> did significantly recover vicariance, other analyses did not favour either dispersal nor vicariance. this could be due primarily to, first, the assumptions made by the models and, second, the different approaches to node reconstruction. in the first case, vicariance is favoured when incorporating area connectivity through time  but dispersal is recovered by adding the parameter j . in the second case, lagrange infers ancestral states by local optimization whereas biogeobears reports ancestral states under the most likely model. this difference is evidenced in ns <dig>  where vicariance is only reconstructed under the global most-likely inference by biogeobears.

we believe, given the paleogeographic scenario and our dating estimations which correlate with the former, that the most plausible explanation for the colonization of cuba is vicariance. furthermore, the whole of extant cuban diversity is monophyletic and sister to a hispaniola lineage, as predicted by the vicariant model. dispersal into cuba 10–25 ma, on the other hand, was not “long-distance” because both land blocks were quite close apart, if not physically connected. thus, if dispersal were actually the main process, we would expect several independent cuban lineages of varied ages surviving to the present  .

vicariance driving speciation within islands is significantly recovered for hispaniolan fauna during two instances, at 10–13 ma and 4–6 ma. the first vicariant instance is independently evidenced in two lineages with simultaneous shifts in ancestral ranges, the lyceius and the confusa-hysius clades. the dating estimates are congruent with the major uplift of the cordillera central which might have provided new ecological opportunities and created isolated populations  <cit> . presence of local adaptations are evidenced not only by the disjunctive distributions of several sister-species pairs found on the northern/southern hispaniola paleoislands respectively  and sierra de bahoruco   <cit> ), but also by ecological niche restrictions. for instance, sister species-pairs within both major clades feed, as larvae, exclusively on distinct bunch grasses, and have morphologically adapted to specific altitudinal ranges. species inhabiting lower altitude and warmer areas are smaller than their sister montane species  <cit> , suggesting an adaptation for thermoregulatory efficiency  <cit> .

the second instance of vicariant process within hispaniola occurred during the pliocene as evidenced in the lyceius and chrysaoros clades. although an uplift of the cordillera central might have played a role in separating populations, the most likely explanation for the northern/southern paleoislands distributions might be related to the inundation of the cul-de-sac/enriquillo depression, which acted as an effective barrier. ecological niche shifts might be another plausible explanation for the lyceus clade members having differentiated during the pliocene. as larvae, they feed on the bunchgrass uniola virgata, which provides a unique niche and would have required significant adaptations  <cit> .

the crown node ancestral distribution of cuban and bahamian calisto is recovered as “eastern cuba ”. its sister taxa are hispaniolan lineages that occur in the northwestern cordillera central   <cit> , which is the closest region to eastern cuba. dispersal to central and western cuba from “ec” appears to be the likeliest biogeographic scenario  <cit> , although vicariance as the main process is only detected in ns <dig> from biogeobears. dispersal dates are in line with the closure of the havana-matanzas channel at 8–5 ma, as well as with the accretion of bahamian shallows and keys in the pliocene/pleistocene  <cit> . the two bahamian lineages have distinct ancestral areas, while c. sibylla has an older origin and its source area is “ec”, c. apollinis dispersed more recently from “western cuba ” .

calisto diversification on the greater antilles and the bahamas
the species richness of calisto across islands is largely unequal. such a pattern has been previously reported as the consequence of island size and age, ecological limits and habitat diversity  <cit> . munroe  <cit>  pointed out that extant calisto diversity is distributed unequally among islands more likely due to speciation rather than to differential immigration, and that extinction was extremely low, especially in hispaniola. the calculation of diversification rates and ancestral states in this study suggested that the extant geographical distribution of calisto reflects the rapid diversification within hispaniola and cuba during two instances, at  <dig> and 14 ma, while inter-island flow was negligible for the entire genus.

calisto is the most species-rich butterfly genus in the west indies because it was able to expand its ecological niche , which raised up the “ecological limits” on calisto diversification. one sole change in the k parameter  is enough to explain the evolution of the whole genus. the recovered date of this shift at 14 ma is congruent with an increase in ecological opportunity in hispaniola and cuba and a time at which new environments were being created as a result of geological processes   <cit> . the decoupling of clade “carrying capacity” and/or diversification rates of the cuban lineage as the only explanation for the genus species richness is not supported. nonetheless, the arrival of calisto to an unoccupied island of cuba did certainly provide for new heretofore empty niches to be colonized. the most likely scenario for such a decoupling was at 14 ma, as recovered in dr <dig> analysis. however, because such a date is confounded with the availability of new niches in hispaniola, a model including one single shift in k for the whole genus was preferred.

adaptive radiation and the origin of island endemism of west indies insects remain statistically untested. under a phylogenetic framework, indirect evidence of adaptive radiation could be inferred based on diversification rate shifts: i.e. a rapid increase followed by a gradual reduction of diversification rate under a diversity-dependent process  <cit> . calisto butterflies might have undergone two increases in diversification before they rapidly reached a “carrying-capacity” limit. the first one occurred during the uplift of cordillera central at 25 ma , triggering a growth in calisto diversification rate until all available niches were gradually occupied, at which time, probably, the speciation rate declined linearly with diversity . it is unlikely that the extinction rate rose, as it was near zero in all of our estimations. the second major radiation took place at 14 ma , but it is more plausible that the diversification rate increased due to a shift in k rather than by a sole increase in speciation rate. furthermore, the “inf.” values of k recovered for the cuban clade in dr analyses might be an indication that the diversification rate has not yet reached its “ecological limit”. the cuban clade, when analyzed independently, better fits a 2-yule-rate, with  <dig> times larger speciation rate at 10 ma than when the lineage branched off at 21 ma.

an intriguing question is why the observed diversification dynamics of calisto on cuba and hispaniola were not replicated on jamaica and puerto rico, the third and fourth largest islands of the west indies, respectively. whereas calisto are usually locally adapted to particular habitats within cuba and hispaniola, the single species on each of the other two islands are widespread. while some diverse hispaniolan lineages feed as larvae on bunch grasses, the puerto rican c. nubila is adapted to widespread-wide-blade grass feeding  <cit> . according to turner, similar, relatively adaptable oviposition behaviour is exhibited by c. zangis of jamaica  <cit> . perhaps in this indiscriminate behaviour lies the explanation for the fact that these two species were able to colonize their entire respective islands instead of forming separate disjunctive populations as did their hispaniolan congeners. such wide distribution and relatively good dispersal abilities of these relatively larger calisto species  may have increased gene flow and hence prevented divergence. further research on the natural history, dietary preferences and behaviour of calisto is necessary to corroborate our speculations.

CONCLUSIONS
the phylogenetic and biogeographical evidence presented in this study agrees with the caribbean paleogeographical model of colonization . vicariant models explaining the diversification of calisto have already been proposed based on their extant geographical distribution  <cit> , although some authors had favoured the alternative dispersalist explanation  <cit> . here we observed that the evolution of calisto passed through both vicariant processes and long-distance dispersals. however, the most important means for diversity origination in this largest genus of west indies butterflies, was intra-island rapid radiation through key innovations  and the availability of ecological niches triggered by environmental changes . nonetheless, more rigorous tests and associations between ecological niche spectrum, phenotypic variability and selection within these butterflies are needed to give the adequate weight to abiotic factors  and niche specializations in the observed burst followed by a slowdown in diversification rates.
