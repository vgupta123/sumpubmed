BACKGROUND
due to their immense biomedical importance, as well as their strong representation within genomes  <cit> , membrane channels and transporters are among the most important classes of proteins to better understand. these proteins facilitate movement of substrates  across intervening membrane barriers. historically, our understanding of these proteins has been hampered by a lack of structural information. however, starting with the potassium channel, which is a membrane transport protein whose structure was solved at high resolution  <cit> , there has been a string of recently solved structures of transporter proteins, including the atp binding cassette  transporter  <cit> , the multidrug efflux transporter acrb  <cit> , lac-permease  <cit> , aquaporin  <cit> , the glutamate transporter  <cit> , ammonia channel amtb  <cit> , na+/h+ antiporter  <cit> , and recently, a leucine transporter, leutaa  <cit> , which is a bacterial member of the na+- and cl--coupled family of transporters . from these groundbreaking efforts, our overall understanding of the sequence/structure/function relationships within transporter proteins is beginning to mature to a point where accurate descriptions of mechanism are possible  <cit> . unfortunately, despite these successes, structural coverage of this segment of the proteome will continue to be sparse for the foreseeable future.

leutaa is a good example where a solved structure has provided a framework to investigate function within its biomedically important homologs  <cit> . leutaa is a bacterial member of the na+/cl- dependent transporter family, which is also called the neurotransmitter/na+ symporter family   <cit> . in the nss family, free energy provided by the flux of sodium and chloride ions down their electrochemical gradients is used to move chemical substrates against concentration gradients across a membrane barrier  <cit> . the chemical substrates recognized by members of the nss family are extremely diverse and include amino acids, biogenic amines, and osmolytes. for example, the serotonin transporter, which is localized to the presynaptic terminal plasma membrane and is responsible for recycling serotonin to the releasing neuron, is a member of this functionally diverse family  <cit> . the serotonin transporter is responsible for clearing serotonin from the synapse after neurotransmitter release, and is the target of many current anti-depression drugs  <cit> . other members of the family include transporters of dopamine, norepinephrine, γ-aminobutyric acid , glycine, proline, creatine, betaine, taurine, and several other small-molecule substrates  <cit> . similar to the serotonin transporter, there is substantial clinical interest in the dopamine, norepinephrine, gaba, and glycine transporters. although the family includes many orfans , subfamily differentiation is generally consistent with the chemical diversity of the transported molecules  <cit> .

the leutaa protein structure is composed of twelve transmembrane helices, two intracellular helices, four extracellular helices, and a small extracellular β-hairpin  <cit> . at present, the fold has only been observed within the nss family. a lack of an unobstructed path through the structure indicates that the structure was solved in the "closed" or "occluded" state  <cit> . interestingly, the first and sixth transmembrane helices  are partially unwound. it has been hypothesized that these unwound regions provide hinges that allow the structure to cycle between three distinct conformational states: outward facing open ↔ closed ↔ inward facing open  <cit> . the backbone amides and carbonyls of the extended residues are involved in ion coordination and hydrogen bonding to the leucine substrate.

due to the paucity of structural coverage, bioinformatic methods provide an attractive means to guide functional studies of membrane integral proteins. in this report, we assess the ability of several sequence-based bioinformatic tools to predict key functional sites within the nss family. the leutaa structure provides structural hindsight to gauge the accuracy of the predictions. our results clearly establish that sequence-based methods can provide key residue-level insight into the structurally derived set of functional sites. remarkably, the importance of these sites is corroborated by previous mutagenesis experiments done on the serotonin, dopamine, and gaba transporters. in addition, this report provides a more complete picture of functional divergence within the nss family than previously described. using a phylogenomics approach, several orfan nss members have been annotated and subfamily differentiation is shown to parallel known functional distinctions.

RESULTS
familial phylogeny and phylogenomic assignment of function
the clustalw  <cit>  generated nss family phylogenetic tree is shown in figure  <dig> and provided in additional file  <dig>  the tree has six major subfamilies . the phylip  <cit>  generated tree  has only minor topological differences; all six subfamily bipartitions are conserved within each tree. four of the six subfamilies are associated with substrates of specific chemical classes. these four subfamilies include transporters for: biogenic amines , osmolytes , as well as two evolutionarily distinct classes of amino acid transporters . the other two subfamilies include a poorly characterized subfamily generically designated as the renal system , and a large prokaryotic subfamily. the osmolyte subfamily, which is the largest subfamily observed, contains  <dig> sequences. conversely, the second of two amino acid subfamilies  has only five sequences. bootstrapping clearly indicates that all six subfamilies  are statistically robust, including the small amino acid # <dig> subfamily .

 <dig> an exact summary of all experimentally characterized and orfan sequences are provided in additional file  <dig> 

while there are significant chemical differences among the substrates across the entire nss family, differences within subfamilies are greatly diminished. for example, all of the four known substrates within the osmolyte subfamily are of similar size and are zwitterionic . moreover, the spatial separation of charge within each is also fairly conserved. in order to extend the annotations beyond the known  descriptions, we employ a phylogenomics approach  <cit> , where appropriate, to assign functional specificity to sequences without annotation. orfans within otherwise obviously annotated out-groups are associated with the consensus annotation. for example, in the osmolyte subfamily, seven sequences are annotated as orfans . five of those sequences occur within well-established out-groups. consequently, functional annotations are assigned here based on the other sequences within their respective out-group. the remaining two orfans occur together, but do not fall into any obvious substrate distinction. as such, these two sequences remain unannotated . application of this approach to the entire nss family increases the number of functional annotations by  <dig>  which is significant, but not necessarily remarkable. however, the annotation improvement becomes significantly more impressive when investigating only the osmolyte and biogenic amine transporter subfamilies, both of which are better characterized experimentally  <cit> . in these two examples alone, ten of twelve orfans can be functionally classified using phylogenetics. 

curiously, there are two distinct groups of gaba transporters within the osmolyte subfamily. the first gaba out-group diverged from the rest of the osmolyte subfamily . branch point  <dig> diverged into the second gaba out-group and the betaine out-group. it is known that some gaba symporters can transport both gaba and betaine  <cit> . therefore, it is tantalizing to suggest based solely on the phylogeny that it is the second group of gaba symporters  that can transport both gaba and betaine, whereas the first group is specific to gaba only . this is, in fact, supported by experimental data. members of this second gaba transporter out-group have been shown to exhibit substrate overlap with members of the other branches in the tree. for example, mouse gat <dig>  transports betaine, and mouse gat <dig>  and mouse gat <dig>  transport taurine and creatine . gat <dig>  does not transport betaine, creatine, or taurine  <cit> . this result profoundly demonstrates the ability of phylogenomic methods to provide key insight regarding the rise of functional specificity divergence.

due to its association with a number of diseases, including depression and anxiety, parkinson's disease, and orthostatic intolerance  <cit> , the biogenic amine transporter subfamily is probably the most biomedically interesting subgroup of the nss family. all members of this subfamily transport common neurotransmitters within the brain, including dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine, and serotonin. the first three are all catecholamines , whereas serotonin  is a derivative of the amino acid tryptophan. consequently, while all four are aromatic amines, there is significant chemical diversity discriminating the catecholamines from serotonin. it is again encouraging that this chemical distinction between substrates  is recapitulated within the subfamily phylogeny . functional studies have shown that in general, the catecholamine transporters transport all catecholamine substrates , whereas they discriminate against serotonin. conversely, the serotonin transporter favors serotonin and discriminates against catecholamine substrates  <cit> .

there are several significant differences between the two amino acid transporter subfamilies. for example, the first  is much larger than the second . further, the first is much better biophysically characterized than subfamily #2; there is only one orfan within amino acid # <dig> , whereas three out of five are orfans within amino acid # <dig>  within subfamily # <dig>  most of the sequences are experimentally characterized as either glycine or proline transporters, whereas some are simply annotated as amino acid transporters. across the subfamily, there is only one orfan, which, based on its out-group consensus, has now been functionally assigned as a glycine transporter. in the smaller subfamily # <dig>  three of the sequences are experimentally annotated as amino acid symporters. the other two, which are diverged from the first three, remain orfans.

of the remaining two subfamilies, one is composed of a wide variety of archaeal and bacterial symporters; this class includes leutaa. we generically designate this subfamily prokaryotic. in fact, this subfamily could be further subdivided into a variety of different out-groups. however, we chose not to further subdivide this portion of the tree due to the fact that there are no conserved functional distinctions present. nothing else obvious  appears to cluster in the same way as the prokaryotic subfamily. nevertheless, consistent with the work of quick et al.  <cit> , there is a mix of eleven and twelve transmembrane homologs within the prokaryotic subfamily, whereas the other subfamilies are always twelve.

the final subfamily, designated as renal, is generically labeled based on the fact that six of the seven experimentally characterized sequences are found within the kidney and/or intestine. the seventh is found in the brain. the remaining  <dig> sequences within the subfamily are uncharacterized. unfortunately, only one of the uncharacterized sequences can be annotated using the phylogenomic approach described above. this is because the experimental annotations are clustered within only two regions of this diverse subfamily. based on the location of the branch point, we also include the homologs highlighted in dark purple within the renal system subfamily; however, no experimental support for this prediction is currently available. in addition, the experimental characterizations of the seven proteins are not very informative. six are generically annotated as "sodium- and chloride-dependent transporters," while the seventh is a proline/hydroxyproline transporter called the imino system.

overall assessment of functional site predictions
the previous section clearly demonstrates that observed functional differences within the nss family are consistent with its phylogeny. this information is important for broadly understanding familial diversity. however, being able to interrogate specific residue differences at functional sites generally provides more insight than interrogations at nonfunctional sites. consequently, we also assess the ability of sequence-based methods to accurately predict important sites within the family. in this report, we attempt to predict functional sites using a variety of different bioinformatic approaches. note that soyer and goldstein  <cit>  similarly published an impressive group of functional site predictions within the nss family using a site class model of evolution. our report is distinguished from theirs in four ways:  they did not have the hindsight of the leutaa structure,  we apply a broader array of functional site prediction strategies, which we find provide both orthogonal and complementary results,  we attempt to correlate the evolutionary differences with functional divergence, and  using published mutagenesis studies of the most well-characterized members of the nss family , we provide extensive evidence supporting the reliability of our bioinformatic approach in predicting functional sites in protein families.

from the leutaa structure , a canonical set of  <dig> functional sites has been identified  <cit> . the functional sites include the two unwound transmembrane helices  at the leucine-binding site, residues directly involved in substrate binding, two na+ binding sites, two extended interaction networks at the cytoplasmic and extracellular gates, and one residue  that stabilizes the unwound tm <dig> helix. the  <dig> functional sites are detailed in table  <dig>  here, we apply six different functional site prediction strategies . the six methods are based on phylogenetic motifs  <cit> , conserved motifs  <cit> , individual site conservation, the consurf  <cit>  conservation algorithm , evolutionary trace  <cit> , and prediction of specificity determining positions  <cit> . table  <dig> describes each method's performance on the complete benchmark, whereas table  <dig> provides performance assessment across the structurally observed binding sites, the predicted cytoplasmic gate residues and the predicted extracellular/periplasmic gate residues.

 <dig> the importance of the functional site benchmark has been clearly established by yamashita et al. from the leutaa structure  <cit> . residue numbers correspond to those of leutaa, rgat <dig>  rsert, and hdat . residues shown in bold with + are those whose functional role is supported by experimental data. residues shown in bold with - are those whose functional role is not supported by experimental data. our literature search failed to find mutagenesis evidence for residues without boldface. the criterion for positive experimental confirmation was a minimum of two-fold reduction in substrate uptake rate and/or affinity of the single site mutant compared to wt. <dig> six unique bioinformatic approaches were utilized in order to predict functional sites within the nss family. the methods employed are: p = phylogenetic motif, f = false positive expectation, s = site conservation, r = rate4site, e = evolutionary trace, and d = sdppred.

 <dig> coverage describes the fraction of correctly predicted functional sites from table 2; the raw count is provided in parentheses.  <dig> absolute accuracy is defined as the ratio of correct predictions to total alignment positions predicted .  <dig> because the pm, fpe, and union methods are based on alignment windows , relative accuracy is also calculated. relative accuracy is similar to absolute accuracy, but describes the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of alignment windows .  <dig> overall performance is calculated as the cartesian distance between  of each method and that of a perfect method . the distance is normalized such that a method with  <dig>  coverage and accuracy would have a value of unity, which is then subtracted from one in order to stay consistent with the coverage and accuracy scales.  <dig> the intersect predictions describe a hybrid approach composed of the unique prediction strategies. whenever the number of predictions for a particular site are greater than the intersect value, that site is put forth as a prediction . due to poor performance, the sdppred method is not considered within the intersect results.

 <dig> each cell of the table includes: coverage; accuracy; and overall performance of the method on each subset of the complete benchmark dataset. the three subsets are defined in table  <dig> 

using phylogenetic motifs , many of these functional sites are predicted. pms, which are a functional site prediction strategy we have developed  <cit> , are sequence alignment regions that mirror the overall familial phylogeny. pms are calculated using the miner program  <cit> . across a wide array of  proteins, pms have been shown to consistently correspond to functional sites defined by both surface loops and active site clefts. however, the method has only been sparsely applied to integral membrane proteins. the last column in table  <dig> demonstrates that pms correspond to the majority of the known functional sites. in fact, pm coverage  is the best of the five methods considered. on the other hand, this sensitivity comes at the cost of specificity. the accuracy  of the pm predictions is only  <dig>  , which is the lowest of the six methods. overall, pm predictions are ranked fourth  when both accuracy and coverage are considered .

conserved regions  are also identified using miner. miner identifies these regions based on a calculated false positive expectation  value for each alignment window  <cit> . windows with smaller fpes are more conserved, and thus less likely to be encountered within a database by random chance. table  <dig> indicates that the fpe method has a good balance between sensitivity and specificity; however, this balance is only maintained in predictions of the binding sites . nevertheless, its overall performance is the second best of the methods presented here . a cursory analysis of the last column table  <dig> suggests that fpe predictions are orthogonal to the pm predictions. it follows that a simple union of the pm and fpe prediction sets predicts  <dig> of the  <dig> functional sites. we develop this union approach because, while there is frequently overlap within the pm and fpe results  <cit> , they are fundamentally based on two distinct  phenomena. pms are based on phylogenetic topology, whereas fpe is based on sequence conservation. the coverage of the union approach is extremely good. in fact, it predicts all nine na+ binding sites and ten of twelve leucine-binding site residues.

four additional prediction techniques are considered: site conservation, rate4site  <cit> , evolutionary trace  <cit> , and predictions of specificity determining positions  <cit> . the site conservation  approach simply returns positions that are conserved greater than 85% within the multiple sequence alignment. while simplistic, this approach can be quite powerful . in fact, it is determined to have the best overall performance of any method considered. interestingly, sc <dig> does very well on predictions of the cytoplasmic and extracellular/periplasmic gate residues . its coverage of the binding site residues is  <dig> .

akin to sc <dig> is rate4site, which attempts to describe the relative evolutionary rate at each position within the alignment using either bayesian  <cit>  or maximum likelihood  <cit>  statistics. in both, phylogenetic tree topology and stochastic evolutionary considerations are considered. impressively, the accuracy of rate4site, which is the best of the five methods, is  <dig>  . it tied for second in overall performance. when considering the benchmark subsets, rate4site does better than sc <dig> on the binding site residues, but does much poorer on the two gate subsets.

the last two methods analyzed both attempt to predict alignment positions that define subfamily specificity. evolutionary trace  is one of the most widely used methods to predict protein functional sites  <cit> . the approach looks for positions that are conserved within out-groups on an input phylogenetic tree  <cit> . the standard application of the approach is to then map both trace residues and conserved positions to a representative structure. however, et predictions without structure can also provide good functional site predictions  <cit> . numerous reports have shown that the approach does a very good job of identifying known functional sites; see lichtarge et al. for a recent review  <cit> . in an analogous way, sdppred  uses mutual information to identify alignment positions where the amino acid distribution is closely associated with the functional specificities. here, both are the two worst performing methods considered overall; the overall performance of et and sdppred is  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. nevertheless, et does have respectable coverage on both of the gate subsets ; its coverage of the binding site subset is only  <dig> . the overall coverage  of the sdppred method is very poor; however, due to so few predictions, its accuracy is reasonable .

taken together, the functional site predictions are quite impressive. all but three of the functional sites are predicted by at least one method. there is also appreciable overlap within the predictions. across the five unique methods,  <dig> of the  <dig> functional sites are predicted by at least three different techniques; four more are predicted by two methods. additional file  <dig> details the results from prediction methods across the entire leutaa sequence. except for sdppred, the coverage of each unique method is always better than  <dig>  . however, consistent with earlier investigations  <cit> , the coverage by et is slightly poorer than those of other approaches. impressively, the coverage by union is  <dig> . the absolute accuracy is best for rate4site ; however, fpe and sc <dig> are very close . this, of course, makes sense as all three methods highlight sequence conservation. curiously, as demonstrated below, there is little overlap between the fpe and sc <dig> predictions.

while the coverage of the pm approach is the best, the absolute accuracy of the pm method  is substantially lower than the others. note that it could be argued that simply comparing absolute accuracy is not a fair metric since pm, fpe, and union are based on alignment windows. sc <dig>  rate4site, and et predictions are based on single alignment positions, whereas the window-based prediction identifies five sites at a time, meaning the denominator of the accuracy ratio is increased. as such, we introduce relative accuracy, which is defined as the number of correct predictions/total number of alignment windows predicted . the relative accuracies of these three approaches are substantially higher than all absolute accuracies. we do not want to overemphasize these results as, again, this is not a perfect comparison – one should never make too much of comparisons of apples and oranges! nevertheless, the absolute and relative accuracies provide an accuracy range that is in qualitative agreement with the other approaches.

predictions of specific functional site sets
the leucine substrate, two sodium ions, and a chloride ion are co-crystallized within the leutaa structure. the biological importance of the leucine and sodium ion binding sites is unambiguous, thus it follows that knowing how well the methods predict the leucine and sodium ion binding sites is imperative to their assessment.  within the functional site benchmark,  <dig> residues are defined as part of the leucine-binding site, whereas nine constitute the sodium ion binding sites . three residues  are involved in both. figure  <dig> clearly indicates that the five different methods result in substantially different predictions. interestingly, the two methods based on sequence windows  have better coverage of these residues . while it is straightforward to view their increased coverage as a simple fact that they predict sequence chunks, this is not the case. in fact, the total number of alignment positions predicted by fpe is less than sc <dig> and et. the other three methods  predict  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the poor coverage of the leucine-binding site by et and sdppred, both of which look  for subfamily specific residues, is particularly notable. the good coverage of the leucine-binding site by the remaining conservation measures suggests that the general binding site location is conserved across the family; however, results from the class specific methods  suggest that the exact details of the transporter-substrate interaction are likely defined by a different set of residue positions across the family. figure 5g color-codes the binding site residues by the number of different methods that predict them. encouragingly, 71% of the binding site residues are predicted by at least two different methods, and 59% of the binding sites are predicted by at least three different methods. coverage of the binding site and extracellular/periplasmic gate residues is also quite good. the coverage of each by three or more methods is 67% and 60%. only one  of the cytoplasmic gate residues is predicted by three or more methods.

across the canonical set of functional sites, all but three  are predicted by at least one method. all three are part of the leucine-binding site. of these three, none is conserved greater than 35%, indicating a lack of strong evolutionary pressure acting on these positions. curiously, all three make van der waals contacts with the leucine substrate. particularly interesting are val <dig> and ile <dig>  with just a handful of exceptions, both positions are chemically conserved; the positions are almost exclusively hydrophobic. this result makes sense within the context of hydrophobic amino acid and biogenic amine transporters  as both groups of substrates are amphipathic with large nonpolar regions that could interact with the hydrophobic binding site residues – they form the base of the binding site pocket around the leucine sidechain . however, it is not clear how nonpolar residues at these two positions can interact with the osmolytes or polar amino acids, both of which have charged groups on both ends of the substrate. this ambiguity is presented to highlight the more gratuitous shortcomings of the sequence-based approaches employed here, and will likely have to wait for further structural studies to be resolved. in spite of the inability of the methods to predict these two sites, all five methods predict sites proximal  to ile <dig>  and three of the methods  do the same for val <dig> 

the extracellular/periplasmic gate residues, which are proximal to the leucine/na+ binding sites, are generally predicted well by sc <dig> and pms, which correctly predict all five and four positions, respectively. fpe, rate4site, and et predict three of the five. conversely, there is more diversity within the cytoplasmic gate residue predictions. sc <dig> predicts all five, whereas pms and fpe fail to predict any; the other methods fall somewhere in between. sdppred fails to predict any cytoplasmic or extracellular/periplasmic gate residues. when considering the unwound transmembrane helices, complementarity between prediction schemes is similarly observed. only fpe is able to predict the unwound regions of tm <dig>  whereas only pms predict all five unwound residues in tm <dig>  glu <dig> is thought to stabilize the unwound region in tm <dig>  all five methods predict glu <dig> to be functional. remarkably, mutation of equivalent residues in at all three eukaryotic homologs  confirms that this position is important  <cit> . additionally, mutagenesis experiments reinforce the importance of the cytoplasmic gate residues, extracellular/periplasmic gate residues, and the leucine/na+ binding sites .

complementarity and overlap within the predictions
as alluded to above, an important conclusion from this work relates to the high degree of complementarity between the different prediction methods. a cursory analysis of the results clearly suggests that the methods provide different prediction sets. complementary between each pair of prediction sets is described by vector orthogonality . orthogonality is calculated as the euclidean distance between a vector pair representing two different functional site prediction sets. each vector has  <dig> dimensions . each dimension is simply a binary possibility . the values are then adjusted such that two completely orthogonal sets have a score of  <dig> , whereas completely identical sets would have a score  <dig> . the fpe/rate4site pair is the most similar; the pair has  <dig>  matches when comparing their prediction sets. after excluding sdppred, which predicts far few functional sites than the other methods, it is surprising that methods ostensibly based on the same approach  are the most dissimilar – they each have  <dig> mismatches. nevertheless, the extent of orthogonality is fairly consistent across all possible pairs, the average and standard deviation is  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

 <dig> complementarity is calculated as the euclidean distance between each vector pair describing the results within table  <dig>  meaning each vector has  <dig> dimensions. each dimension is simply a binary possibility . the values reported are normalized such that two completely orthogonal vectors will have a distance of one; two vectors that are absolutely the same will have a distance of  <dig> , whereas two completely orthogonal vectors will have a distance of  <dig> . the average value and standard deviation across the matrix are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, which corresponds to  <dig>  and  <dig>  differences.

we also investigate how predictions based on simple intersections of the various unique methods improve prediction accuracy. meaning, only positions that are simultaneously predicted by multiple methods are put forth as a prediction. due to poor overall performance, sdppred is excluded from this analysis. moreover, sdppred only predicts positions that are predicted by at least three other unique methods. table  <dig> demonstrates that the simple intersect method clearly improves performance. only nine positions are concurrently predicted by all five schemes. as discussed above, one corresponds to glu62; three others correspond to binding site residues; and three correspond to extracellular/periplasmic gate residues. when a site is predicted by any four methods,  <dig> are predicted, half of which are included in the functional site set. impressively, relaxing the criterion to any three methods raises the coverage and accuracy to  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. when any two methods intersect, the accuracy is reduced to  <dig>  , but the coverage increases to an impressive  <dig> . interestingly, figure  <dig> indicates that predictions with better support, meaning they are predicted by multiple methods, are more likely to cluster around the leucine-binding site and the proposed transport route . it will be quite interesting to determine from future investigations if the intersect predictions  do a better job of predicting positions that exhibit a functionally deleterious phenotype upon mutation.

substrate transport route
while the unwound regions of tm <dig> and tm <dig> clearly constitute the leucine-binding site within leutaa, yamashita et al. also predict that they act as joints within the protein structure, which allow it to change conformations  during substrate transport. this model is consistent with the general alternating access model proposed for carriers  <cit> . their model predicts that substrate passage occurs along a route defined by tm <dig>  tm <dig>  tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig>  the solved leutaa structure is thought to be in the closed or occluded conformation. the yamashita model proposes that the salt bridge between arg <dig> and asp <dig>  is broken when the structure occupies the outward facing open conformation. conformational changes within the extracellular helices el <dig> and el <dig> are believed to concomitantly occur on loss of the salt bridge. their model is supported by experimental data showing that el <dig> and el <dig> adjust during transport  <cit> . more drastic conformational changes are believed to occur on opening of the cytoplasmic gate. on loss of a second "locking" salt bridge, this time between arg <dig> and asp <dig> , tm1a and tm6b are believed to "swing out" via the hinges provided by the unwound helices. this conformational change at the cytoplasmic gate provides an opening for the substrate and accompanying ions to dissociate into the cytoplasm, thus completing ion/substrate cotranslocation across the plasma membrane. intriguingly, the structure suggests that the two na+ ions and the leucine substrate share the same permeation pathway.

assessment of functional sites from available mutation data
since cloning of the mammalian members of the nss family of transporters in the early 1990s  <cit> , several laboratories have devoted considerable effort to understanding the structure-function relationships of these proteins. in particular, site-directed mutagenesis has served as a powerful tool with which to identify amino acid residues that govern various aspects of transporter function . in this report, we have used representative results gained from these functional studies in order to provide additional support for the  <dig> structurally derived functional sites. note that this list is not meant to be exhaustive; rather, it is simply meant to support or refute the  <dig> sites examined above. for this purpose, we have chosen representative studies on the rat isoform of the serotonin transporter , human dopamine transporter , and rat gaba transporter  <dig> . these transporters are chosen due to the large number of experimental studies available. as a general rule, the functional data strongly support the data concluded by structural as well as bioinformatic approaches . of the  <dig> functional sites present, we identify corroborating mutagenesis data in all but three sites .

the importance of several of the positions within table  <dig> is supported by mutagenesis on multiple homologs. for example, seven positions  have experimental mutants with functional phenotypes in all three transporters investigated here . curiously, residue identity is not conserved within two of these positions , suggesting that these positions are important to the family's functional diversity. an additional thirteen positions are supported by experimental data in two of the homologs surveyed. moreover, the general importance in other symporters of each functional class discussed  within the leutaa structural description is confirmed  <cit> . only three experimentally characterized mutants lack a phenotype; however, in each case, mutation at the equivalent position  within one of the other two investigated homologs does.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented herein, using the nss family as a model system, clearly demonstrate that common bioinformatic methods are able to provide key functional insight into membrane integral proteins in the absence of structural considerations. in general, the methods are able to both predict known functional sites and reveal clear evolutionary discrimination between observed functional distinctions. as such, our results  clearly establish that the employed methods represent a viable means to guide experimental mutagenesis studies and better illuminate functional roles within membrane integral proteins.

more specifically, the phylogeny reveals six clear subfamilies that reflect known functional divisions across the family. in addition, the phylogeny impressively recapitulates several nuanced functional difference within well-characterized subfamilies . likewise, functional sites predicted from sequence reproduce most of the canonical set from yamashita et al. while the methods provide different prediction sets, accuracy is substantially improved when residues are predicted by multiple methods. the observation that the collective set of bioinformatic predictions map to the previously proposed substrate transport route is particularly compelling. finally, the generality within the importance of these sites across more biomedically relevant members of the nss family is established by comparing to the large body of experimental mutagenesis results available within the literature.

it is remarkable that even in the absence of high-resolution structural data, earlier mutagenesis experiments and the sequence-based functional site predictions presented here provide sound insight into the role of various amino acid residues in protein function. however, even with the wealth of data now available regarding nss sequence/structure/function relationships, many questions remain unanswered. for example, even though cotransport of na+/leucine is not cl--coupled within leutaa, the structure revealed a cl- binding site facing the extracellular space  <cit> . this is very interesting because cl- translocation is coupled to na+/substrate cotransport in some members of the nss family  <cit> . a second unanswered question stems from the fact that the leutaa structure fails to provide insight into the diversity of functional features  observed in some members of the nss family  <cit> . however, it is not surprising that these differences are not predicted by the leutaa structure since it exhibits only ≤ 25% sequence identity to its mammalian counterparts. moreover, the functional analysis by yamashita et al.  <cit>  is insufficient to address such nuanced functional issues  within leutaa, meaning that they will have to be addressed experimentally in the future. it is expected that further combinations of structural studies, phylogenomics, advanced functional site prediction techniques, and mutagenesis experiments should provide investigators with a more refined strategy to examine motifs within the larger nss family and, in particular, within subfamilies where unique functional features exist.
