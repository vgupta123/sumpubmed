BACKGROUND
protein structure classification is well-known to be an important research topic in computational and molecular biology. through the use of structural classification, life science researchers and biologists are able to study evolutionary evidence from similar proteins that have been conserved in multiple species. in addition, similar 3-d conformations of enzyme active sites and binding sites may correlate with biochemical functions  <cit> . in recent years, structural genomics projects  <cit>  have aimed to link protein sequences to possible functions via high-throughput techniques such as x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance  that determine 3-d protein structures. with a large-scale set of newly-discovered structures, a system that classifies similar protein structures with high efficiency and accuracy becomes an indispensable requirement to the study of structure-to-function relationships.

several classification systems categorize proteins based on structural similarities. the class, architecture, topology, homologous superfamily  database  <cit>  is constructed by applying the secondary structure alignment program   <cit> , which consists of a double dynamic programming technique to find the optimal structural alignment of two proteins. the fold classification based on structure-structure alignment of proteins  database  <cit>  is built based on the distance alignment   <cit>  algorithm that applies monte carlo heuristics to compare structural similarities from 2-d distance matrices mapped from 3-d protein structures. generally, these systems rely on the structural alignment algorithms to measure the similarity of two proteins, which is known to be of complexity np-hard  <cit> . to reduce the computational effort of scanning large-scale protein databases, those structural alignment algorithms need to apply heuristics with trade-offs which may return divergent results from the same query protein. at present, the structural classification of protein  database  <cit> , which is manually constructed by human experts, is believed to contain the most accurate structural classifications. in the scop database, proteins with similar domain structures are usually clustered into the same fold hierarchy. even though manual classification provides reliable results, it is labor intensive. as of may 30th,  <dig>   <dig> newly-discovered proteins deposited in the protein data bank   <cit>  have not been classified in the latest scop v <dig>  release. the number of newly-discovered proteins is increasing continuously.

recent studies  <cit>  apply a consensus scheme to classify the scop folds for newly-discovered proteins by intersecting multiple classification results from classical structural alignment algorithms such as dali  <cit> , combinatorial extension   <cit>  and vast  <cit> . these consensus approaches yield higher classification accuracies than each individual method. however, a combination of structural alignment algorithms is computationally expensive. to accelerate the manual classification process of scop, there is an urgent need to develop a fast, automated scop fold classification system with a reasonably high accuracy. by extending our recent works with the real-time tertiary structure retrieval system, proteindbs  <cit> , we have already studied an efficient model of association rule  mining to identify relevant structural patterns in proteins for scop domain and fold classifications  <cit> . in this paper, we further develop a non-parametric classifier to conduct the scop fold classifications with better accuracy and efficiency. our contribution is to introduce a real-time classification model, e-predict, that applies the e_measure metric  <cit>  from the information retrieval  field to assign the known scop folds and recognize the novel folds for newly-discovered proteins. in the past, a number of systems have been developed to assign a protein structure to an existing fold or recognize it as a novel fold. for example, dali  <cit>  uses z-score of the best structural match to either assign a structure to a known fold  or novel fold . other programs, such as ce  <cit>  and vast  <cit>  can perform similar tasks. however, the computational effort associated with those methods prevents a user from exploring the protein structure database in real time.

RESULTS
there are two important tasks for the scop fold classifications. 1) known scop fold assignments: the algorithm assigns newly-discovered protein structures into the known scop folds. 2) novel scop fold recognitions: the algorithm detects whether or not newly-discovered protein structures should be categorized into the novel folds. given two scop database releases v <dig> and v <dig> , Δv1v2

assigning newly-discovered proteins to the known folds
we conduct three experiments for classifying newly-discovered proteins into the known folds. the first experiment compares our classification model, e-predict, with several methods reported in a recent work  <cit>  such as ce, dali, vast and cboost. our test data shown in table  <dig> is the same test set used in their work, which has proteins with average sequence identities equal to  <dig> % and average sequence similarities equal to  <dig> % by conducting all against all pairwise alignments using emboss-align  <cit>  algorithm. the same ground truth data with their work includes proteins from the entire scop vl. <dig> release. to evaluate the accuracy, we use a general metric, correct classification rate , which is defined as follows:

efficiency
for efficiency, we measure the average response time of the entire classification process, including feature extraction, nearest neighbor search on an m-tree  <cit> , and the computation of the scop folds by the e-predict algorithm. the classification process performs one-against-all structural comparisons by scanning the entire scop database. our system runs on a fedora-core linux system with dual xeon iv  <dig>  ghz processors and  <dig> gb ram. a large-scale test set is chosen from the scop vl. <dig> release with  <dig> protein chains which have more than  <dig> amino acids. figure  <dig> shows the average response time of fold classifications for various protein chain sizes. when the protein size increases, the e-predict algorithm demands more computational resources to extract features from larger distance matrices. when the protein chain size reaches a certain threshold, the linux system may swap huge distance matrices into the virtual memory resulting in a significant i/o time. this effect is reflected in figure  <dig> with long computation times for the protein chain size larger than  <dig> amino acids, where more memory is required to prevent page swapping. on average, classifying a newly-discovered protein to a scop fold takes  <dig>  seconds. in our test set, the longest protein chain, comprised of  <dig> amino acids, completes the classification process in  <dig>  seconds.

discussion
our approach yields better accuracy and efficiency compared to the structure alignment algorithms. the accuracy is achieved by analyzing the ranked scop folds of a nearest neighbors search using the e-predict algorithm. in addition, efficiency results from using an m-tree  <cit>  for fast nearest neighbor searches. in the following subsections, we compare our performance with the structural alignment algorithms in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

performance in efficiency
since structural alignment algorithms usually apply dynamic programming techniques to align each pair of amino acids in two proteins, they demand a huge amount of computational resources. instead of aligning amino acids, our e-predict model transforms relevant protein structure information into high-level features, and similar protein structures are then retrieved from a high-dimensional feature space by a nearest neighbors search in the m-tree. our approach is able to return the classification result in seconds. since performing the structural alignment algorithms with multiple pairwise alignments of a newly-discovered structure against the known protein structures from the scop database is known to be computationally expensive  <cit> , the response times for the structural alignment algorithms are not plotted in figure  <dig> 

the accuracy of assigning newly-discovered proteins to the known folds
for the assignment of proteins to the known scop folds, the e-predict algorithm mainly contributes to the accuracy. traditional structural alignment methods usually apply heuristics to reduce computational efforts of aligning a large combination of amino acids in two proteins. different heuristics could return diverse results from the same set of proteins since these algorithms might be trapped in local optimal solutions. even though a consensus method that combines classification results of multiple structural alignment algorithms outperforms each individual structural alignment approach  <cit> , it is computationally expensive. instead of performing structural alignments, our model maps both known proteins from the scop database and newly-discovered protein structures into 33-d feature vectors. with a nearest neighbor search for a newly-discovered structure t in the high-dimensional feature space, there may exist multiple candidate folds, which are associated with nearest neighbor proteins in the vicinity of t. one way to assign a scop fold to t is to choose the fold of the nearest neighbor protein in the high-dimensional feature space. since it is possible that hundreds of folds are partially overlapped in the high-dimensional feature space, the nearest neighbor of t may be an outlier that deviates from the majority of proteins in its fold. to avoid selecting an outlier, we apply the e_measure metric that considers the ranks of at least two nearest neighbor proteins for each fold. the algorithm rewards a scop fold in which proteins are highly ranked and penalizes a fold with proteins in the lower ranks. hence, when the scop fold includes only a single highly ranked protein with the other proteins from this fold ranked much lower, the algorithm is able to avoid assigning this fold to t based on the penalty of low ranking. from computational results, e_measure has a vital impact on the classification accuracy.

within the framework of proteindbs  <cit> , our model, e-predict, transforms a 3-d protein structure into a 33-d feature vector that represents the geometric properties of folded proteins. applying these features to measure the structural similarity of proteins, e-predict outperforms several classification methods that apply the structural alignment algorithm using the test set in table  <dig>  e-predict also yields reasonably high accuracy for several test sets in table  <dig> with sufficient ground truth data. however, misclassifications still exist. the limited amount of 33-d ground truth data available for training contributes to the classification errors. as more ground truth data becomes available in small-size scop folds, a higher classification accuracy is expected. the second reason for misclassifications is due to the overlapping of folds in the high-dimensional feature space. to further separate overlapping folds, our system needs more relevant features to detect the protein 3-d folding with sufficient discriminating power. another possible reason for misclassifications is that scop may categorize a partial segment of a pdb protein chain  into a domain. since our approach measures the global similarity of distance matrices for classification, users need to submit the portion of the protein chain identified in the scop domain to ensure a correct classification. in figure  <dig>  we measure the correlation between the classification accuracy and a structure variation value, s, for a query protein t and the best matched protein of t in our classified scop fold. for a pair of proteins , the structural variation s is defined as follows:

s=rmsd/,

where rmsd means the root mean square deviation of aligned segments, and na denotes the number of amino acids in the aligned segments of two proteins. np <dig> and np <dig> represent the number of amino acid residues in p <dig> and p <dig>  respectively. these measurements are computed using sarf  <cit> . the smaller s value can be interpreted as a better structural match for two proteins p <dig> and p <dig>  two proteins that have a high structural similarity can usually be superimposed with longer aligned residue segments and a small rmsd value, resulting in a small s value. for example, the sarf algorithm aligns a query protein t with  <dig> amino acids and its best matched protein p <dig> with  <dig> amino acids and returns structurally similar segments with  <dig> amino acid residues and  <dig>  Å of rmsd. their structure variation value s is computed as  <dig> / =  <dig> . when s is smaller than  <dig>  we expect the e-predict algorithm to maintain above 90% classification accuracy. this statistic is obtained from the classification of  <dig> testing proteins.

the accuracy of recognizing the novel folds for newly-discovered proteins
since no protein has been labeled with the novel folds in our 33-d ground truth data, the novel fold recognition becomes a challenging problem. to address this issue, we introduce three features: e_measure evaluation score, structural variation value, and euclidean distance measurement. these features measure structural similarity between a newly-discovered protein and the nearest neighbor protein in a candidate known fold suggested by the e-predict algorithm. then, our method applies the e-predict algorithm as a classifier to identify meaningful patterns from ground truth data, which has been obtained by the aggregation of proteins in several prior scop releases. computational results show that using these three features benefits the classification accuracy.

misclassifications of recognizing the novel folds for newly-discovered proteins
to recognize the novel folds for newly-discovered protein structures, our classification model exploits three relevant features. with the assumption that protein structures in the novel folds usually present low structural similarities to proteins in the known folds, a high e_measure evaluation score, a high euclidean distance, and a high structural variation value are expected for newly-discovered protein structures from the novel folds. due to noise in ground truth data and imperfect features, a few proteins in the novel folds may have a low structural variation value, a low e_measure score, or a low euclidean distance measurement. even though our approach presents an improved accuracy over nn and c <dig>  dt, there is still a need to discover more relevant features for better recognition performance.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed an automatic scop fold classification system that is able to assign the known scop folds and recognize the novel folds for newly-discovered proteins. for the known fold assignments, the algorithm transforms protein structures into 33-d feature vectors and constructs an m-tree to index these feature vectors for fast retrievals. the e-predict algorithm is then applied to classify newly-discovered proteins in the known scop folds. for the novel fold recognitions, the algorithm utilizes three relevant features that are related to structural similarity of proteins. from the computational results, our method outperforms several structural alignment algorithms such as dali, ce and vast, achieving reasonably high classification accuracy and efficiency. this research can help accelerate the classification process of the scop database and benefit the biomedical research community to further study biochemical functions of proteins with similar 3-d structures.
