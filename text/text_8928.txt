BACKGROUND
peste des petits ruminants , also known as goat plague and ovine rinderpest, occurs in goats, sheep and related species. it is caused by a morbillivirus in the family paramyxoviridae. it is closely related to rinderpest, measles, canine distemper and morbilliviruses of marine mammals and is the most economically important viral disease of small ruminants  <cit> . in the field, ppr virus causes disease in goats and sheep. goats are usually considered to be more susceptible than sheep, but this is not always the case; cattle and pigs can be infected sub-clinically by experimental infections  <cit> ). the disease is characterized by high fever, discharges from nose, eyes and mouth; profuse diarrhoea; pneumonia; and oral erosion, with high morbidity  <cit> . in susceptible populations, morbidity and mortality rate are 5-90% and 50-80%, respectively  <cit> . post mortem examination reveals frothy exudates in respiratory tract, congestion and partial consolidation of lungs, congested mesenteric and bronchial lymph nodes, severe congestion, haemorrhages and edema in gastro-intestinal tract  <cit> . histologically characteristic lesions are usually seen in digestive and respiratory systems  <cit> . in intestine histologic findings of natural ppr virus infection include atrophic villi with partial denudation of epithelial lining and intense diffusion of mononuclear cells in the lamina propria and sub-mucosa  <cit> . the lungs show broncho-interstitial pneumonia characterized by proliferation of bronchiolar lining epithelium, intense diffusion of mononuclear cells mainly in lymphoid, macrophages and plasma cells in the pericardial, the interstitial tissue and alveolar lumina  <cit> . in bangladesh, the first outbreak of ppr was recorded in  <dig>  <cit> . since then outbreaks are being reported regularly across the country. in  <dig>  there were  <dig>  veterinary clinic cases, causing an estimated loss of taka:  <dig>  million   <cit> , but the actual number of cases may be even more because infected cases from remote rural areas were not brought to the veterinary clinic. although prevention is the main strategy against viral diseases, supportive treatment may prevent some loss. knowledge of pathology and pathogenesis may help in formulation of supportive treatment. pathology of ppr has been reported in different goat and sheep breeds from experimental infections  <cit> . pathological data from field cases are very important as they could better characterize the pathogenicity of the circulating virus. the severity of the disease varies with species, immunity and breed of the host  <cit> . pathological investigations of natural outbreaks of ppr in black bengal goats are very limited  <cit> .the current investigation was aimed at describing the pathology and antigen localization in natural ppr infections in black bengal goats.

RESULTS
clinical findings
this investigation examined  <dig> outbreaks of ppr in black bengal goats from different parts of the country having average 75%  morbidity, 59%  mortality and 74%  case fatality . mortality was higher in the young  goats . the veterinarians treated  <dig> –  <dig> out of  <dig> affected goats with antibiotic, antihistamine, astringent and 5% dextrose saline for a week. a few  of the treated goats survived after treatment but  <dig> goats died after a month due to secondary bacterial infections . the goat that died after a month was not included in the mortality calculation. the most frequently observed signs were abrupt rise of body temperature  that lasted for  <dig> to 5 days. the affected animals were severely depressed, standing apart and had impaired appetite and constipation. rise of body temperature was accompanied by watery discharges , which lasted for  <dig> to 5 days. very often ocular discharges were associated with conjunctivitis; nasal discharge became purulent and blocked nostril in advanced stages. medial canthus revealed some crusts at later stages. small areas of necrosis were seen on the visible nasal mucous membranes. the erosive and necrotic stomatitis was seen on hyperaemic gums, cheeks, dental pad and on tongue, with frothy salivation in some cases. in some cases circular raised non-bleeding lesions were present on the tongue. lesions similar to orf developed at mucocutaneous junction of mouth in many animals at later stages of the disease. abortion was frequent at all stages of pregnancy. diarrhoea was common with sub-normal body temperature usually  <dig> to 6 days after the first appearance of clinical signs. the hindquarters of diarrhoeic goats were soiled with liquid greenish feces. bronchopneumonia, evidenced by coughing, was common at the later stages of ppr. in severe cases, most animals died within a week. a subnormal temperature preceded death in animals when severe diarrhoea continued for a few days.table  <dig>

necropsy findings
the carcasses were dehydrated and emaciated with sunken eyes, but some goats were in good bodily condition after death at early infection. the lesions of respiratory tract included necrotic areas on the mucosa of nostrils and turbinate and severely congested tracheal mucous membrane with white frothy mucus in lumen . the lungs were dark red or purple with areas firm to touch, mainly in the anterior and cardiac lobes . in the digestive tract, rumens of three goats revealed ecchymotic haemorrhages  and streaks of haemorrhages were also seen in duodenum and the terminal ileum . the lymph nodes, especially from the mesentery were severely oedematous, congested and enlarged . the large intestine was usually more severely affected with congestion around the ileocaecal valve, at the caeco-colic junction, and in the rectum, although not in all the carcasses. spleen was atrophied in cases that died after a couple of weeks . erosive vulvo-vaginitis was observed in eight animals.figure  <dig>

histopathological findings
details of the histopathological findings are listed in table  <dig>  the most remarkable lesions were found in respiratory, alimentary and lymphatic systems. goats that died within 48 hours of the onset of clinical signs were mostly haemorrhagic and showed severe exudation in the upper respiratory tract and in the lung parenchyma. the exudates in the lung parenchyma often proceeded to fibrinous organization . in goats that died after 3– <dig> days, lesions of lungs were more severe, with additional involvement of alimentary tract. the lung parenchyma was infiltrated with large mononuclear cells and clumps of these cells were found in the lung alveoli . in some places, alveoli lost its lining of squamous epithelium, which were partially replaced by cuboidal type epithelial cells. the entire alimentary tract revealed haemorrhagic gastroenteritis with infiltration of mononuclear cells in the lamina propria and loss of laminar epithelia. clumps of epithelial cells were aggregated in the lumen of the intestine. liver was severely congested and haemorrhagic. changes in the lymphatic systems appeared more haemorrhagic in goats that died within 2– <dig> days. lymphatic organs were depleted of lymphocytes . these lesions were more severe in goats that survived more than a week. conspicuous lymphoid depletion was seen in peyer’s patches in  <dig> cases, in lymph nodes in  <dig> cases, and in spleen  in  <dig> cases.table  <dig>

sequence analyses
the representative pcr products of f and n genes of one isolate were sequenced from a commercial source and confirmed by comparing with known ppr sequence. the sequences have been submitted to the genbank . on phylogenetic analysis the present bangladeshi strain clustered in lineage iv and formed a sub-cluster along with recent isolates from tibet, tajikistan and india. these isolates have two unique amino acid substitutions  in n protein, which were not evident in other lineage iv isolates.

discussion
peste des petits ruminant virus  produced severe pathological lesions in respiratory tract, alimentary tract and lymphatic system in natural outbreaks in black bengal goats. ppr has been one of the most prevalent infectious diseases among goats in bangladesh and is considered an emerging economically important disease. in the present study,  <dig> outbreaks in flocks having  <dig> goats were investigated. the suspected samples were first screened by rt-pcr for ppr virus. the flock morbidity and mortality in this study were  <dig> to 100% and  <dig> – 100%, respectively, whereas few other authors found 5-90% and  <dig> – 80%, respectively  <cit> . according to field veterinarian’s observations, young goats  were more susceptible than the aged, which are inconsistent with the findings of taylor et al.  <cit> . this may be due to maternally derived ppr antibody that persists up to 4 months  <cit> . it is likely that antibody derived from sub-clinical infection in aged goats protected themselves as well as their young progenies. this observation was in accordance with those reported by taylor et al.  <cit> . some authors reported that more severe disease results from mixed infection of bacteria and viruses  <cit> . we did not take any attempt to isolate bacteria from these cases. in bangladesh, when a goat is affected by ppr, veterinarians generally treat with antibiotic, antihistamine, dextrose saline and astringent mixtures. treatment may help to reduce mortality from ppr due to  control of respiratory bacterial infections and  counteracting shock by astringent mixture, dextrose saline and anti-histamine. some goats that survived the acute stage of the disease died later, possibly due to immunosuppression induced by the pprv. pprv can cause severe lymphocytolysis in lymphoid tissues, such as tonsils, spleen, peyer’s patches, and mediastinal and mesenteric lymph nodes resulting in immunodeficiency  <cit> . our observation also revealed lymphoid depletion in the lymphatic nodules and spleen.

in the present study in black bengal goats, characteristic erosive ulcerative lesions in the mouth and inflammatory lesions in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract corroborate the findings of previous studies in sheep and other breeds of goats  <cit> . cast of intra-luminal epithelial cells and macrophages in the lung tissue is a characteristic feature of morbillivirus infection. immunohistochemically, pprv were detected in the intra-luminal epithelial tissues and macrophages.

histologically, proliferation of macrophages in different organs was seen, which indicates primarily non-purulent inflammation. depletion of lymphocytes from lymph nodes and spleen may be due to affinity of the virus to lymphoid tissue and the involvement of lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of ppr  <cit> . the virus localizes in the lung parenchyma and causes diffuse interstitial pneumonia with eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies in the pneumocytes  <cit> . although we did not find intra-nuclear inclusion bodies with h&e, antigen was detected in pneumocytes and macrophages with immunohistochemistry. brown et al.  <cit>  used lung tissue for indirect immuno-histochemical methods and detected viral antigen in pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages. we were not able to detect pprv antigen in tissues of other organs, the reason was not clear to us.

in this investigation, both blood and nasal swab samples were positive for virus in most cases. but  <dig> goats sampled at non-febrile stage 7 days after onset of clinical signs were positive only with nasal swabs. the febrile stage usually persists for  <dig> – 3 days and then the virus localizes in the respiratory and associated tissues and therefore excretes the virus through nasal secretion for longer period. therefore the nasal swab can be a good choice for the pcr detection of ppr virus in infected animals both in febrile and non-febrile stages of the disease.

CONCLUSIONS
the striking histo-morphological diagnosis was acute pneumonia and severe gastro-enteritis. since bangladesh is a ppr endemic country, stamping out is not practiced. therefore, early supportive treatment based on the pathological findings, could reduce the mortality of ppr virus infected goats which is economic for the poor farmer. a detailed experimental pathological study of black bengal goats infected with different isolates is required.
