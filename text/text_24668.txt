BACKGROUND
leptin and insulin function as peripherally-derived hormone signals involved in the long-term regulation of energy balance  <cit> . their circulating levels are directly proportional to adipose mass and cns access occurs via saturable receptor-mediated processes. the primary cns target for these adipostats is the arc, where leptin and insulin receptors are highly expressed, and where direct administration of either hormone has a potent effect on food intake and body weight. two specific arc neurone populations have been strongly implicated in sensing changes in levels of circulating leptin and insulin and transducing these signals into neuronal outputs  <cit> . these "first-order" neurones encompass the melanocortin precursor, pomc containing neurones and npy and agrp co-containing neurones, the former associated with catabolic, the latter anabolic, outputs. leptin and insulin increase pomc mrna levels and decrease npy & agrp mrna levels respectively.

however, transcriptional control is not the only effector mechanism elicited by these hormones on arc neurones. electrophysiological studies have shown that leptin depolarizes and increases the firing rate of arc pomc neurones and inhibits the tone of npy/agrp neurones  <cit> . although the electrophysiological actions of insulin have not been reported for identified pomc and npy/agrp neurones, both leptin and insulin have been demonstrated to inhibit, by hyperpolarization, the firing of a sub-population of arc neurones, identified by their sensitivity to changes in extracellular glucose concentration  <cit> . for these latter neurones, termed glucose-responsive , katp channels have been identified as an effector mechanism through which leptin and insulin elicit neuronal inhibition. consequently, leptin and insulin signal the status of body energy stores by activating their receptors on arc neurones, eliciting changes in the electrical activity and amounts of releasable peptides in specific neuronal populations, leading to compensatory effector outputs, such as changes in food intake, energy balance and glucose homeostasis  <cit> .

obese humans have elevated leptin and insulin levels, indicative of central resistance to these hormones  <cit> . the mechanisms underlying this resistance are unclear, with defective hormone passage through the bbb and flawed receptor-signal transduction in arc neurones being the prime candidates  <cit> . consequently, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying leptin and insulin receptor modulation of arc first-order neurones. leptin and insulin, by stimulation of their respective receptors, have been demonstrated to activate various signalling pathways in peripheral tissues  <cit> . however, as these hormones induce seemingly identical actions on arc neurones, both in terms of behavioural output and effects on arc neurone excitability, some parallelism or convergence of signalling is likely  <cit> . leptin, by binding to the long form of the leptin receptor  has been demonstrated to activate three main signalling cascades, jak <dig> – stat <dig>  mapk and pi3k, the latter two of which are also intermediates in insulin receptor activation  <cit> . however, recent studies have strongly implicated pi3k as the key signalling intermediate in leptin and insulin actions on hypothalamic neurones influencing food intake and body weight  <cit> .

thus, to elucidate further the pathways that contribute to convergent actions of leptin and insulin on arc neurones, we have examined the phosphorylation status of key leptin and insulin signalling intermediates in the arc and have explored the linkage, with a focus on pi3k mediated signal transduction pathways, between these hormones and arc neurone katp channel activation.

RESULTS
leptin and insulin stimulate phosphorylation of signalling proteins in arc
rat hypothalamic tissue sections, predominantly made up of arcuate nucleus, were treated with acsf alone or with leptin  or insulin  for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes. leptin and insulin stimulation induced comparable immunoblot profiles , with increased levels of phosphorylated stat <dig> , phosphorylated mapk , phosphorylated pkb/akt  and gsk <dig> . the phosphorylation status of the latter two proteins, pkb and its downstream effector gsk <dig>  were utilised as a sensitive assay for hormone activation of pi3k. leptin  or insulin  treatment was observed to cause an increase in phosphorylation of all four proteins. this increase in phosphorylation was generally transient with the highest levels of phosphorylation at the  <dig> and/or  <dig> minute time points. subsequent to this peak level, in the majority of experiments, the phosphorylation was not sustained over the time period examined and returned to control values within  <dig> minutes . these data demonstrate that all  <dig> pathways potentially contribute to insulin and leptin signalling in arc neurones and thus play a role in connecting leptin or insulin receptor activation to neuronal effector outputs. as both leptin and insulin signalling in the arc require pi3k activity for reduction in food intake and body weight  <cit> , we examined the sensitivity of the phosphorylation of pkb/gsk <dig> and mapk to the presence of pi3k inhibitors. isolated arc sections were incubated either in control acsf,  <dig> nm wortmannin or  <dig> μm ly <dig>  for  <dig> minutes prior to exposure to control acsf, leptin  or insulin , in the continued presence of the appropriate inhibitor. the presence of ly <dig> prevented leptin or insulin induced phosphorylation of pkb and gsk <dig> following  <dig> minute exposure to these hormones, illustrated in figure 2a, as expected for proteins downstream of pi3k  <cit> . furthermore, the presence of the pi3k inhibitor per se reduced p-pkb and p-gsk <dig> levels significantly, indicating that pi3k is active to a limited degree in these arc neurones. similar results were obtained for wortmannin . however, surprisingly the pi3k inhibitors also reduced the leptin- and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of mapk . these data further establish pi3k as a key component of neuronal leptin and insulin signalling in arc neurones and suggest a potential role for pi3k in leptin and insulin driven transcriptional activity. because the phosphorylation status of these signalling intermediates was examined in whole arc extracts, this supplies little information as to the mechanisms by which adiposity hormones target specific arc neurones. thus, we have tried to delineate the molecular events connecting leptin and insulin receptor activation, pi3k activity and effector outputs. here we focus on the activation of katp channels, responsible for leptin and insulin inhibition of an electrophysiologically identified subset of arc neurones  <cit> .

leptin and insulin activate katp channels in acutely isolated arc neurones
cell-attached recordings from rat isolated arc neurones were used to confirm that leptin and insulin activate the large conductance katp channel as previously described  <cit> . leptin, present in the recording electrode during cell-attached recordings, increased mean k+ channel activity in 45% of unidentified neurones . mean channel activity , 1– <dig> minutes following cell attached formation was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>   after peak activation had occurred . in control cell-attached recordings of between 10– <dig> minutes, with  <dig> nm leptin in the pipette solution, there was no effect on k+ channel currents observed in other arc neurones . during peak katp channel activation by leptin, bath application of the katp channel inhibitor tolbutamide , reduced mean channel activity by  <dig> ± 12% , an effect reversible on washout of drug . following leptin-induced increase in channel activity, patch excision into the inside-out configuration allowed channel sensitivity to atp to be assessed. at a patch potential of  <dig> mv and in asymmetric cation gradients, mean channel activity was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and bath application of  <dig> mm mgatp  reversibly reduced channel activity by  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . current-voltage relations under symmetrical k+ conditions were linear, with a mean single channel conductance of  <dig> ±  <dig> ps . the sensitivity to tolbutamide, atp and single channel characteristics are consistent with leptin activation of the large conductance katp channel of gr neurones  <cit> . in a separate series of cell-attached recordings from isolated arc neurones, bath application of insulin  also increased katp channel activity in 45% of unidentified neurones . nf.po increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  under control conditions to  <dig>  ±  <dig>   after approximately  <dig> –  <dig> minutes exposure to insulin . insulin had no effect on other k+ channel currents in cell-attached recordings from the remaining neurones . consequently, these data are in agreement with previous studies on rat arc gr neurones  <cit> .

leptin and insulin activation of arc neurone katp is pi3k dependent
as leptin and insulin activation of katp channels in arc neurones is rapid  and the leptin increase in katp activity demonstrated in isolated patches  <cit> , this action is unlikely to be mediated by changes in transcription. furthermore, in cell-attached recordings, following leptin  stimulated katp channel activity, application of the mapk pathway inhibitor, pd <dig>  had no effect on nf.po . a previous study has demonstrated that insulin activated arc neurone katp channels are similarly insensitive to this mapk pathway inhibitor  <cit> . however, inhibition of pi3k does reverse both leptin  and insulin-induced activation of arc neurone katp channels. leptin  increased katp mean nf.po from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , and subsequent bath application of  <dig> nm wortmannin reduced katp activity to a mean value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   over a period of 15– <dig> minutes, an nf.po indistinguishable from control . similarly, in a separate series, leptin increased nf.po from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and subsequent application of  <dig> μm ly <dig> reduced nf.po to  <dig>  ±  <dig>   within 15– <dig> minutes. essentially identical data have been reported previously for the effects of these pi3k inhibitors on insulin-activated arc katp channel activity  <cit> . thus these results demonstrate that leptin and insulin signalling pathways converge on pi3k to elicit gr neurone hyperpolarization, and confirm that pi3k is a key enzyme in individual arc neurone responsiveness to both leptin and insulin.

such a central role for pi3k suggests that its main lipid product, ptdinsp <dig> may serve as an important second messenger for downstream effectors such as the katp channel. the mechanism by which ptdinsp <dig> recognises downstream target proteins is by binding to specialised phosphatidylinositol recognition sites, such as the pleckstrin homology  domain  <cit> . thus, to demonstrate that ptdinsp <dig> production is elevated in arc neurones following exposure to leptin and insulin, we used the ph domain of grp- <dig>  which selectively binds ptdinsp <dig>  <cit>  coupled to gfp  in an overlay assay on fixed freshly isolated arc neurones. in non-stimulated arc neurones there is significant labelling of all neurones with ph-grp1-gfp . this is likely due to inherent pi3k activity of the neurones, rather than non-specific binding, as a ph-grp1-gfp fusion protein with a single point mutation , which does not bind ptdinsp <dig>  <cit> , displays very little reactivity with non-stimulated arc neurones . stimulation of isolated arc neurones with leptin  for  <dig> minutes resulted in a proportion  of dispersed neurones displaying increased fluorescence after treatment with wild type fusion protein . in addition, exposure of dispersed neurones to insulin  for 5– <dig> minutes induced increased binding of ph-grp1-gfp fusion protein in a similar proportion of neurones , although insulin appeared to induce greater levels of binding/fluorescence than leptin . however, leptin and insulin driven phosphorylation of pkb and gsk <dig> along with induction of elevated ptdinsp <dig> levels in arc neurones, are only indicative of increased pi3k activity. thus we examined irs- <dig> associated pi3k activity  <cit>  in isolated arc wedges exposed for one or two minutes to leptin  or insulin . although we observed an increase in activity in 4/ <dig> and 4/ <dig> experiments for leptin and insulin respectively, there was no overall significant increase observed . this may be due to the relative paucity of leptin and /or insulin sensitive neurones in the overall cellular population.

leptin and insulin activation of gr neurone katp requires actin filament re-organisation
previous studies have demonstrated that the phosphatidylinositol lipid second messenger, ptdinsp <dig> activates katp channels in an insulin-secreting cell line when applied directly to the internal aspect of isolated patches  <cit> . however, activation of katp is probably not due to direct binding of the lipid to channel subunits, as the effect of ptdinsp <dig> on katp was prevented by the presence of the actin stabilizing agent, phalloidin. additionally, leptin-induced opening of this insulin-secreting cell katp channel was occluded when phalloidin was present in the cell interior  <cit> . thus we examined whether adiposity hormone signalling in arc gr neurones also requires actin remodelling in order to manifest a specific effector output, the activation of hypothalamic neurone katp channels. as our assessment of hormone activation of gr neurone katp channels uses cell-attached recordings, we used the membrane permeable actin stabilizing toxin, jasplakinolide to induce actin polymerization  <cit> . in preliminary experiments, jasplakinolide  was demonstrated to have no effect when applied directly to isolated inside-out patches obtained from arc neurones, under asymmetrical recording conditions, containing spontaneously active katp channels . cell-attached recordings with leptin  present in the pipette solution, increased mean katp channel activity from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . subsequent bath application of jasplakinolide  reversed the leptin-induced katp activation , with channel activity returning to  <dig>  ±  <dig>   within 5– <dig> minutes, a level indistinguishable from pre-leptin controls . in a second series of cell-attached recordings, bath application of insulin  increased mean katp activity from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and subsequent bath application of jasplakinolide , in the continuous presence of insulin, reduced channel activity to  <dig>  ±  <dig>   within 5– <dig> minutes . the inhibition of leptin and insulin stimulated katp channel activity by jasplakinolide was reversible on washout of the toxin in 2/ <dig> and 3/ <dig> patches for leptin and insulin respectively.

pi3k mediates leptin-induced actin filament reorganisation in gt1- <dig> cells
preliminary experiments labelling rat arc slices with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin to stain for f-actin were unsatisfactory due to the overall high levels of staining in the slices and inability to distinguish clearly individual neurones and their responses to hormone stimulation. similarly, use of freshly isolated arc neurones was precluded as the phalloidin staining was inconsistent among individual neurones within a single preparation and between neuronal preparations. thus we have used the mouse hypothalamic cell line, gt1- <dig>  to demonstrate that leptin utilises a pi3k-dependent signalling cascade to modify cytoskeletal dynamics. a previous study indicated that gt1- <dig> cells express obrb  <cit> , although others do not concur with this conclusion  <cit> . using rt-pcr, we detected the presence of leptin receptor mrna in gt1- <dig> cells by amplification of a common extracellular domain of the mouse receptor. further analysis using primers specific to obrb, which contains a long cytosolic domain with the intracellular protein motifs required for signalling  <cit> , demonstrates the presence of this receptor isoform in gt1- <dig> cells . we have also used this hypothalamic cell line to examine whether leptin is capable of increasing pi3k activity directly. in response to  <dig> nm leptin, irs-2-associated pi3k activity was modestly, but significantly, increased . thus, using native gt1- <dig> cells leptin  induced a decrease in cortical f-actin as visualised by alexa  <dig> conjugated phalloidin staining, which was prevented or reversed by the presence of  <dig> nm jasplakinolide . as cellular cortical actin structure is determined by the dynamic equilibrium between f- and g-actin, a reduction in f-actin at the plasma membrane should be accompanied by a corresponding increase in the concentration of free g-actin in the cells  <cit> . figure  <dig>  demonstrates, using alexa  <dig> conjugated dnase i staining of the same cells, that leptin does indeed increase the concentration of g-actin and that this effect is also sensitive to the presence of jasplakinolide . indeed, dual staining of the gt1- <dig> cells demonstrates  that leptin alteration of the cortical cytoskeleton is due to a concomitant increase in the content of g-actin at the expense of f-actin, and that this action is completely inhibited in the presence of jasplakinolide. the alteration in cytoskeletal dynamics by leptin is also pi3k dependent as shown in figure 9a, where the presence of either  <dig> nm wortmannin  or  <dig> μm ly <dig>  substantially reduced the ability of leptin to decrease the levels of f-actin and increase g-actin as assessed by phalloidin and dnase i staining respectively. this cell staining method of assessing leptin stimulated changes in actin dynamics was compared to direct quantitative analysis of actin. live cells were treated with leptin  ± jasplakinolide  or ly <dig>  or wortmannin  for  <dig> minutes, triton-x- <dig> soluble  and insoluble  actin fractions separated and run on a gel  <cit> . exposure of cells to leptin did not alter total cellular actin, whereas g-actin levels increased by  <dig> fold, at the expense of f-actin, the levels of which declined by 65% . thus, leptin induced a change in the g/f actin ratio from a control value of  <dig>  to  <dig> . these data correlate well with the change in fluorescence intensity observed in leptin-treated fixed cells , where g-actin levels were also increased by  <dig> fold and f-actin decreased by 70% . exposure of cells to the f-actin stabilizing agent, jasplakinolide or the pi3k inhibitors, ly <dig> or wortmannin prevented leptin from inducing f-actin disassembly as observed by either assay . in addition, protein overlay experiments using wild type ph-grp1-gfp fusion protein binding to assess ptdinsp <dig> levels in gt1- <dig> cells demonstrate that leptin increases pi3k activity concurrently with the re-organization of cortical actin in this cell line, with leptin stimulation inducing little change in the k273a mutant ph-grp1-gfp binding to these cells .

discussion
pi3k – a pivotal enzyme in arc signalling
previous studies have demonstrated that leptin applied in vivo stimulates hypothalamic obrb to increase phosphorylation of the signalling protein intermediates stat <dig> and mapk and that both leptin and insulin increase hypothalamic pi3k activity  <cit> . here we have applied hormones directly to arc wedges isolated from hypothalamic slices to enable improved signal detection , localisation of signalling to the arcuate nucleus and to fix external conditions so that potential compensatory changes associated with in vivo studies are obviated. exposure of arc wedges to leptin or insulin induced rapid  phosphorylation of mapk , stat <dig> and the pi3k activity indicators, pkb and its downstream target gsk <dig>  these hormone-induced increases in phosphorylation were transient in the majority of experiments, usually lasting 1– <dig> minutes at ~34°c with return to control levels of phosphorylation within  <dig> minutes. such rapid recovery has also been noted in other studies  <cit>  and may be due to activation of endogenous phosphatases such as ptp1b curtailing this acute signalling process  <cit> . the phosphorylation of mapk is quite modest and at present there are few data which link this pathway directly with the actions of either insulin  <cit>  or leptin  <cit>  on energy homeostasis, although recently it has been shown that centrally driven insulin-mediated sympathoactivation of brown adipose tissue is mapk-dependent  <cit> .

as expected, exposure of arc wedges to leptin induced an increase in tyrosine phosphorylated stat <dig>  <cit> . however, unexpectedly insulin also induced an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of stat <dig> in arc neurones. in a previous study  <cit>  in vivo application of insulin  demonstrated no such change, unless leptin was co-applied. the data reported here indicate that insulin per se is capable of increasing stat <dig> phosphorylation, as no exogenous leptin was present or endogenous leptin likely to remain in the arc sections following the extensive washes and incubations prior to stimulation. this difference may be due to an increased signal to noise delivered using arc tissue over whole hypothalamus and that rapid transient signals are more readily detectable by this method. both leptin and insulin rapidly increased the phosphorylation of pkb and its downstream effector gsk <dig> in a wortmannin and ly <dig> sensitive manner, indicative of increased pi3k activity in arc neurones, in agreement with previous in vivo studies  <cit> .

however, our results did not demonstrate that either leptin or insulin induced a significant increase in irs-2-associated pi3k activity measured directly in arc tissue. this may be due to a low signal to noise ratio, as only a  proportion of cells would be expected to respond to the hormones in the arc tissue block, and/or that hormone mediated increases in pi3k activity are limited to plasma membrane microdomains. this is supported by the very modest increase in pi3k activity detected in gt1- <dig> cells when stimulated by leptin. although hypothalamic activation of pkb by insulin has been reported previously  <cit> , these are the first reports that leptin increases pkb activity and that both hormones increase the phosphorylation of gsk <dig> in the arc. the presence of the pi3k inhibitors, wortmannin or ly <dig>  also reduced the leptin and insulin driven increase in mapk phosphorylation. the mechanism by which leptin and insulin cause phosphorylation of this protein is most likely through the ras pathway, as this protein has been demonstrated to interact directly with the catalytic subunit of pi3k  <cit>  and inhibitors of pi3k have been reported to inhibit insulin induced increased mapk activity, for example in rat adipocytes  <cit> . the insulin mediated enhanced stat <dig> tyrosine phosphorylation in an interesting observation that requires further examination. although phosphorylation of tyrosine- <dig> on stat <dig> is a prerequisite for dimerisation and translocation of stat <dig> to the nucleus  <cit> , phosphorylation of serine- <dig> may also be required for maximal activation of stat <dig> dna binding  <cit> .

interestingly one pathway candidate for phosphorylating serine- <dig> is the ras/raf/mek signalling cascade, and indeed a recent study has demonstrated that leptin can induce s <dig> phosphorylation of stat <dig> in a pd <dig> dependent manner in macrophages, and this is required to produce full stimulation of stat <dig>  <cit> . insulin mediated serine phosphorylation of stat <dig> has also been reported, using transfected chinese hamster ovary cells, to be mediated by a mek-dependent pathway  <cit> . a similar mechanism in hypothalamic neurones would indicate an inter-connection between the three identified signalling pathways activated by these hormones and an important effector molecule, stat <dig>  studies are underway to examine this proposal.

the importance of stat <dig> signalling to the central mechanisms that control energy homeostasis has recently been directly demonstrated by transgenic mouse studies. using a 'knock-in' strategy to induce defective stat <dig> binding to obrb  <cit>  or a 'knock-out' strategy to ablate stat <dig> from some hypothalamic neurones  <cit> , loss or reduction in hypothalamic stat <dig> signalling initiates hyperphagia, increased body weight and adiposity with alterations in glucose homeostasis. indeed, the jak2-stat <dig> and irs2-pi3k signalling pathways are purported to underpin the genomic and acute or membrane functions of these signalling pathways respectively  <cit> . clearly, further work is required to determine the exact signalling mechanisms controlling insulin stimulated stat <dig> phosphorylation in hypothalamic neurones.

leptin and insulin signalling to katp channels
leptin and insulin cause inhibition, by hyperpolarization through activation of a sulphonylurea-sensitive k+ conductance, of a subset of hypothalamic neurones, defined by their acute sensitivity to changes in external glucose concentration, termed gr neurones  <cit> . single channel recordings from acutely isolated arc neurones demonstrate that both hormones activate the same k+ channel, the sulphonylurea-sensitive large conductance katp channel. this action is rapid and independent of transcriptional events, so most likely is mediated by mapk or pi3k signalling. pharmacological inhibition of the mapk pathway with pd <dig> did not reverse leptin  or insulin  <cit>  stimulated katp activity, abrogating this pathway from causing the hyperpolarising response. in contrast, inhibition of pi3k with either wortmannin or ly <dig>  reversed both leptin  and insulin  <cit>  raised katp activity. furthermore, use of the fusion protein ph-grp1-gfp as a specific detector of ptdinsp <dig> in isolated neurones also demonstrated that both hormones rapidly increase the cellular content of this pi3k lipid product in a sub-population of neurones. these results are consistent with class  <dig> pi3k  <cit>  acting as a point of convergence for leptin and insulin signal transduction pathways to katp channels in gr neurones. the functional significance of pi3k in the control of energy balance has been demonstrated by in vivo studies, which show that leptin  <cit>  and insulin  <cit>  stimulate irs2-associated pi3k activity in the hypothalamus and pharmacological inhibition, using wortmannin and ly <dig>  of hypothalamic pi3k activity prevents the anorectic actions of icv leptin or insulin, whereas the mapk inhibitor pd <dig> had no effect on leptin driven attenuation of food intake  <cit> .

remodelling of cortical actin filaments as a leptin and insulin signalling event
leptin and insulin stimulated katp activity in isolated arc neurones was also reversed, within 5– <dig> minutes, by the marine sponge toxin, jasplakinolide. this toxin binds to f-actin with high affinity, resulting in its stabilization and prevention of depolymerization to its monomer g-actin  <cit> . these data indicate that the adiposity hormones require actin filament depolymerization for katp activation to occur. such a mechanism is supported by reports that agents, which promote actin depolymerization, activate katp channels in cardiac myocytes  <cit>  and the insulin-secreting cell line, cri-g <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, in this latter study leptin stimulated katp channel activity was also shown to depend on actin filament depolymerization. insulin is also well documented to cause actin filament re-organization in peripheral cells associated with various functional outputs, which depend on pi3k activity, including metabolic and mitogenic effects  <cit> . the reversal of hormone-stimulated katp activity by jasplakinolide was faster  than for the pi3k inhibitors . this temporal difference suggests that the site of jasplakinolide action is downstream from the pi3k signal transduction pathway to katp channels.

however, alteration of the cellular cortical actin structure is inferred through the use of natural agents like jasplakinolide. in order to verify directly that hormone-driven structural re-arrangements did occur we decided to use the hypothalamic cell line, gt1- <dig>  as preliminary experiments using freshly isolated neurones did not produce reliable and reproducible data due to the presence of dead and dying cells showing as false positives for hormone induced actin depolymerization. use of this cell line also obviated any problems with identification of obrb containing neurones and neuronal subtypes in slices. rt-pcr analysis indicates that this cell line does express the main signalling form of the leptin receptor and analysis of pi3k activity shows functional coupling of this receptor to this signalling pathway. we have shown, by cell staining of fixed cells and, independently by analysis of cellular g- and f-actin concentration from live cells, that leptin disrupts cortical actin structure by disturbing the processes that maintain the equilibrium between f-actin and g-actin, in the direction of depolymerization to g-actin. this effect of leptin was completely inhibited by the presence of either jasplakinolide or the pi3k inhibitors. in addition, there is a good temporal and spatial association between ptdinsp <dig> production, as determined by ph-grp1-gfp binding, and actin filament depolymerization. thus, leptin and insulin signalling in, at least some sub-groups of hypothalamic neurones maintains a close parallel with leptin signalling in insulin-secreting cells, where it has been reported that leptin increases katp activity by a pi3k-dependent cortical actin re-arrangement  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the effect of leptin and insulin on the phosphorylation status of various cellular signalling intermediates and on katp channel activation in arcuate neurones indicates that both hormones activate the same signalling cascades, and can produce common outputs. the sensitivity of both katp opening and the phosphorylation of certain intermediates to pi3k inhibition is significant as this enzyme has been previously demonstrated to play an important role in leptin and insulin mediated energy homeostasis control. furthermore it is interesting that leptin and insulin induce rapid phosphorylation of mapk and stat <dig> as these data support the view that these hormones may influence genomic and membrane neuronal outputs by common mechanisms. the inhibition of leptin and insulin stimulation of katp channel opening of arcuate neurones by jasplakinolide suggests a role for cytoskeletal dynamics in modulation of membrane events such as neuronal hyperpolarization. this hypothesis is further strengthened by the finding that leptin induces actin filament depolymerization in a mouse hypothalamic cell line, which is pi3k dependent, demonstrating that this cell line may be a useful model for further analysis of leptin signalling mechanisms in hypothalamic neurones.
