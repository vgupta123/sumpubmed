BACKGROUND
the aim of cell therapy research is to produce successful cell cultures that can be used in the treatment of various disorders. however, it is a subject of on-going research, and many questions remain unanswered. the available data show that there are various populations of mesenchymal stem cells  that exhibit variable patterns of proliferation and differentiation within the same individual  <cit> . these populations are unevenly distributed in the tissues, and the tissue site determines the proliferative and differentiation potential of mscs isolated from the same individual  <cit> . some studies have shown that the osteogenic potential of mscs may vary as a function of tissue type  <cit> , <cit> , collection site  <cit> , animal species  <cit> , age  <cit> , <cit> , state of health  <cit> , and performance of physical activity on a daily basis  <cit> , <cit> .

in vitro comparison of the osteogenic potential of various msc sources allows for the selection of the most promising mscs for bone regeneration therapy. bone marrow  <cit>  and adipose tissue  <cit>  are considered to be the main sources of mscs due to the presence of large numbers of cells and the simplicity of collection and isolation. however, the best source of mscs for bone regeneration therapy remains unknown  <cit> . few studies have compared bone marrow and adipose tissue mscs in dogs. one such study compared the in vivo osteogenic potential of mscs from bone marrow, adipose tissue, and umbilical cord blood in treating bone defects in dogs  <cit> . however, no study has yet compared the in vitro osteogenic potential of mscs from the bone marrow and adipose tissue of the same animal.

therefore, the aim of the present study was to perform a quantitative assessment of the osteogenic potential of bone marrow  and adipose tissue  mscs from young dogs, in order to identify the best source of mscs for bone regeneration therapy in dogs. the hypothesis is that the bm-mscs present higher osteogenic potential than the ad-mscs, since in the organism these cell these cells differentiate naturally into osteoblasts.

RESULTS
cell phenotype characterization
both bm-mscs and ad-mscs exhibited an elongated fusiform shape. phenotype characterization found high expression of the stem cell markers cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  in bm-mscs and cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  in ad-mscs. the expression of haematopoietic cell markers was low: cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  in bm-mscs and cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  in ad-mscs.

conversion of mtt into formazan and alkaline phosphatase activity
all of the groups exhibited an increased ability to convert mtt into formazan crystals throughout the culture period independent of the medium used. mscs cultured in basal medium exhibited greater mtt conversion compared to those cultured in osteogenic medium on days  <dig> and  <dig>  when subjected to osteogenic differentiation, bm-mscs exhibited greater mtt conversion compared to ad-mscs under the same culture conditions on days  <dig> and  <dig> .

except for ad-mscs on day  <dig>  all of the cells exhibited greater alp activity when cultured in osteogenic medium. relative to the cultures in osteogenic medium, ad-mscs exhibited greater alp activity on day  <dig> compared to bm-mscs. this increased activity was not found at the later time-points of assessment  .

collagen synthesis, percentage of cells, and mineralised matrices
all of the groups exhibited an increase in the percentage of cells per field throughout the culture period regardless of the medium used. mscs in basal medium systematically exhibited a higher number of cells per field compared to those subjected to osteogenic differentiation, although the initial number of cells was the same. the number of cells per field corresponding to undifferentiated bm-mscs was higher compared to that of ad-mscs under the same culture conditions at all the investigated time-points. when cultured in osteogenic medium, the number of cells per field corresponding to bm-mscs was higher than that of ad-mscs under the same culture conditions on days  <dig> and  <dig> .

except for ad-mscs on days  <dig> and  <dig>  collagen synthesis was higher in the groups subjected to osteogenic differentiation compared to the undifferentiated groups. on days  <dig> and  <dig>  bm-mscs exhibited greater collagen synthesis compared to ad-mscs under the same culture conditions, and the opposite result was found on day  <dig> .

both cell types exhibited the morphologic changes typical of osteogenic differentiation on day  <dig> in osteogenic medium, including nodule formation and the production of mineralised matrix. in the differentiated groups, the percentage of mineralised matrix increased throughout the culture period, while the formation of mineralised matrix was minimal in the undifferentiated groups at less than 3% per field. relative to the cells subjected to osteogenic differentiation, the percentage of mineralised matrix per field was systematically higher in bm-mscs compared to ad-mscs .

gene transcripts of osteogenic differentiation
osterix expression was higher in mscs subjected to osteogenic differentiation compared to those kept in basal medium and those of osteoblasts. on days  <dig> and  <dig> of osteogenic differentiation, osterix expression was greater in bm-mscs compared to ad-mscs under the same culture conditions, and no difference was found on day  <dig> .

the expression of bsp by mscs was lower compared to osteoblasts. however, bsp expression by bm-mscs in osteogenic medium on days  <dig> and  <dig> was similar compared to osteoblasts. the expression of bsp by mscs subjected to osteogenic differentiation was higher than that by mscs kept in basal medium. relative to the cells subjected to osteogenic differentiation, the expression of bsp by bm-mscs was higher compared to ad-mscs .

the expression of oc was systematically higher in the mscs subjected to osteogenic differentiation compared to the undifferentiated mscs that were cultured in basal medium and osteoblasts. the expression of oc by bm-mscs subjected to osteogenic differentiation was systematically higher compared to ad-mscs under the same culture conditions .

discussion
the elongated shape of bm-mscs and ad-mscs, as well as the observed phenotypic characteristics of high stem cell marker expression and low haematopoietic cell marker expression, indicated successful isolation of mscs as per the defined standards of the international society for cellular therapy  <cit>  and reports by other authors  <cit> , <cit> .

the lower level of mtt conversion into formazan crystals exhibited by the mscs subjected to osteogenic differentiation was suggestive of lower mitochondrial activity, as found by other authors  <cit> . this observation may be attributed not only to the lower metabolic activity of differentiated cells compared to undifferentiated mscs but also to the lower number of cells in the groups subjected to osteogenic differentiation, as seen in the present study. as differentiation progresses, cellular proliferative capacity decreases, and the cell activity shifts to the synthesis of proteins specific to the differentiated cell and the extracellular bone matrix components  <cit> .

the greater mtt conversion found in the bm-mscs subjected to differentiation indicated greater activity in those cells compared to ad-mscs under the same culture conditions. this finding represents an advantage in the use of bm-mscs; the more active the cell, the more extracellular matrix it produces, thus promoting bone regeneration when used for therapeutic purposes.

the gradual and progressive increase of alp activity during the process of osteogenic differentiation found in both bm-mscs and ad-mscs suggested successful osteogenic differentiation  <cit> , <cit> . the enzyme alp is present in the osteoblast membrane, participates in the synthesis and mineralisation of the bone matrix, and is one of the most widely used markers of in vitro osteogenic differentiation  <cit> . its expression may increase up to  <dig> times during the process of osteogenic differentiation  <cit> .

the greater collagen synthesis and mineralised matrix per field exhibited by bm-mscs compared to ad-mscs subjected to osteogenic differentiation indicate not only improved osteogenic differentiation in the former but also greater capacity for extracellular matrix synthesis under the same culture conditions. type i collagen is the main component of the organic bone matrix, corresponding to 90% of its composition. it is considered an early marker of osteogenic differentiation and may be expressed by osteoprogenitor cells, pre-osteoblasts, and osteoblasts  <cit> .

the presence of mineralised nodules beginning at day  <dig> in both msc types cultured in osteogenic medium confirmed the occurrence of differentiation in these cells. following osteogenic differentiation, the mscs become cuboid or polygonal in shape, resembling osteoblasts, and they cluster concentrically, forming mineralised nodules  <cit> . such nodules are considered reliable indicators of in vitro osteogenic differentiation  <cit> .

the increased osterix expression in the bm-msc and ad-msc cultures subjected to differentiation is a relevant indicator of osteogenic differentiation because this transcription factor is indispensable for differentiation. osterix participates in the transformation of pre-osteoblasts into mature osteoblasts, which is the final step of differentiation  <cit> . furthermore, increased osterix expression by mscs subjected to osteogenic differentiation is considered to be an indicator of differentiation in canines  <cit> .

the greater osterix expression exhibited by bm-mscs on days  <dig> and  <dig> also suggested improved osteogenic differentiation of these cells compared to ad-mscs under the same culture conditions.

the increased expression of bsp and oc during the differentiation found in the present study is a reflection of the final stage of the osteogenic differentiation of bm-mscs and ad-mscs. the non-collagen matrix proteins are considered markers of osteogenic differentiation, and they are closely related to the production and mineralisation of the extracellular matrix  <cit> .

the greater expression of bsp and oc by bm-mscs found in the present study during the entire process of differentiation gives further proof of their improved osteogenic differentiation compared to ad-mscs. bsp is a protein that initiates the process of nucleation and deposition of hydroxyapatite in the bone matrix. increased bsp expression reflects the final stage of differentiation and the onset of matrix mineralisation. it may be expressed by pre-osteoblasts and osteoblasts  <cit> , and increased expression was found in the osteogenic differentiation of ad-msc  <cit> .

osteocalcin is a bone-specific glycoprotein that promotes matrix mineralisation. it is expressed by osteoblasts and, therefore, reflects the end of the differentiation and maturation of the bone matrix. it is considered a late and more specific marker of osteogenic differentiation  <cit> , <cit> . increasing levels of oc expression during osteogenic differentiation of bm-mscs and ad-mscs has also been reported by other authors  <cit> , <cit> .

the greater expression of markers of osteogenic differentiation, together with greater collagen synthesis and larger mineralised areas exhibited by bm-mscs compared to ad-mscs found in the present study, confirmed the greater osteogenic potential of bm-mscs in young dogs. similar results were reported by im et al.  <cit> , who compared the osteogenic potential of bm-mscs and ad-mscs in humans.

CONCLUSIONS
to conclude, bm-mscs showed greater osteogenic potential compared to ad-mscs when extracted from young dogs.
