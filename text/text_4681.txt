BACKGROUND
botulism is a rare life-threatening disease caused by botulinum neurotoxins , secreted by the spore-forming bacterium, clostridium botulinum. seven bonts serotypes  have been described but serotypes a, b and e are responsible for the majority of natural human intoxications  <cit> . botulinum neurotoxin a  is the most toxic substance known, with a human 50 % lethal dose  estimated at 1 ng.kg− <dig> , 10 ng.kg− <dig>  or 1 μg.ml− <dig> , leading the centers for disease control and prevention  to classify bonts among the six major biological warfare agents  . bonts are type a-b heteromeric molecules composed of a 100 kda heavy chain  and a 50 kda light chain . the heavy chain is successively implicated in the toxin binding at the surface of the motoneurons, the internalization by dual-receptor-mediated endocytosis and the translocation of the light chain into the cytosol. the light chain is a zinc endopeptidase which cleaves proteins of the snare  complex, which is implicated in the exocytosis of the acetylcholine  <cit> . the snap <dig>  protein is cleaved by bont/a-lc. this inhibition induces a flaccid muscular paralysis, affecting progressively all the muscles and generally leading to a respiratory distress and eventually death in absence of treatment. vaccines against botulism have been developed but vaccination is rarely used as its effectiveness has not been fully evaluated and has demonstrated adverse events  <cit> . thus, vaccination is only used for individuals with a high risk of exposure, such as health care providers, researchers, first responders, and military personnel  <cit> . moreover, bonts have been introduced as a safe and effective treatment for a wide range of disorders associated with involuntary muscle contractions and spasm disorders, and these ever-increasing medical indications prevent large scale vaccination against botulism  <cit> . currently, there is no licensed small inhibitor available in the pharmacopeia. thus, the botulism specific treatment is based on the injection of anti-toxin antibodies, which should be administered as soon as possible after the clinical diagnosis to reduce the mortality rate, complemented by several months of hospitalization in an intensive care unit with mechanical ventilation  <cit> . infant botulism cases are treated by injections of a human-derived botulinum immunoglobulin preparation , which is well tolerated, but available in very limited quantity and is expensive  <cit> . adult botulism is treated by injections of a bivalent  or heptavalent  horse-derived antitoxins, available in larger quantity. nevertheless, because of their animal origin, these antitoxins may be poorly tolerated and could induce serious adverse effects like serum sickness or anaphylactic shock  <cit> .

the development of human or human-like antibodies for passive vaccination is advised as an alternative. in a former study, recombinant antibody fragments were isolated from an immune and a non-immune human library against botulinum toxins  <cit> . the immune library was built starting from a volunteer immunized with botulinum toxoids a to e, and yielded the single chain fragment variables  with best affinities and neutralization properties compared to those obtained from the naïve library . within the context of the antibotabe project , this strategy was previously used successfully to isolate neutralizing antibodies directed against the light chain of bont/a .

in this work, two antibodies cross-reacting with and cross-neutralizing both botulinum neurotoxin sub-types a <dig> and a <dig> , were generated.

RESULTS
animal immunization and phage-displayed library construction
a macaque  was hyper-immunized with four injections  of a recombinant protein representing the binding domain  of bont/a <dig> heavy chain . thirteen day after the third immunization, a titer of 1/ <dig> , 1/ <dig> . <dig> and 1/ <dig>  was observed in elisa against bont/a1-hc , bont/a <dig>  and bont/a <dig> , respectively, confirming that sufficiently high immune response for the generation of a phage-display immune-library had been reached. four months after the third immunization, the decrease of the macaque immune response was checked; the macaque bone marrow was drawn , and as expected, no significant pcr amplification of the dna coding for the fd fragment of the gamma heavy chain  and for the variable region of the kappa light chain  of the antibodies was observed. this absence of amplification is due to the long period of time separating the third immunization and this sampling , and confirmed that the resting period was sufficiently long to decrease the immune response of the macaque. the corresponding profile of amplification was used as a negative control to observe the increase of the immune response after the fourth  immunization. after the last immunization with bont/a1-hc, the bone marrow was iteratively sampled during 24 days . using the same specific primers set as before the final immunization, the amplification of the pcr products increased and reached optimum 10 days after the last immunization, where all primer pairs were strongly amplified compared to the other days . because the macaque was maintained in an animal house preventing environmental contamination, its humoral immunity was not stimulated with antigens other than injected-bont/a1-hc. as a consequence, just before the fourth immunization, no pcr amplification of the genes coding for the antibody variable regions was observed. the pcr products amplified at the 10th day were thus regarded as specifically encoding variable regions of antibodies directed against bont/a1-hc. fd fragments of the γ heavy chain and κ light chain products of amplification were separately pooled and inserted into pgem®-t vector to construct, two sub-libraries presenting diversities of  <dig>  ×  <dig> clones and 1 ×  <dig> clones, respectively. these two sub-libraries were combined by two consecutive cloning steps into the phal <dig> vector  to generate the immune-library. first, vl gene fragments were cloned, using mlui and noti, and then vh fragments, using ncoi and hindiii. the final scfv library consisted of  <dig>  ×  <dig> independent clones with a full-size insert rate of 79 % and was finally was packaged in m13k <dig> phage.fig.  <dig> scheme of macaque hyper-immunization and bone marrow sampling. a scheme of macaque hyper-immunization. four injections of the immunogen were performed, and sera were sampled to estimate the immunization titer. b scheme of the bone marrow sampling, from 4 days before the first immunization up to 24 days after the last



panning of the library for the isolation of scfv directed against bont/a1
the phage-displayed scfvs library was subjected to  <dig> rounds of panning against bont/a <dig> holotoxin with the number of washes doubling after each round . after each round, only the phage having interacted with bont/a <dig> were eluted. between the first and the second round of panning the number of eluted phage decreased from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , underlining the selection of the small proportion of reactive phage among the whole immune-library . between the second and the third round of panning, the number of eluted phage increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , which corresponds to the strong amplification and selection of reactive phage. the reactivity of the phage eluted after each round against bont/a <dig> was assessed in phage-elisa and, the signal increased 9-fold between rounds  <dig> and  <dig>  confirming the enrichment in scfvs highly reactive against the target . no reactivity was observed against klh or bont/b <dig>  indicating that eluted phage were highly specific for bont/a <dig> and that no cross-serotype reactivity was observed. the input titer of phage used for each round of panning was determined each day, and always comprised between  <dig> and  <dig> phage particles .

isolation of anti-bont/a <dig> scfvs and affinity determination
one hundred clones eluted after the last round of panning were randomly chosen and their dna was extracted and sequenced. the dna sequences were translated into peptidic sequences with expasy transalte tool. the sequences with an early stop codon or with an incorrect size were considered as recombined. the non-recombined sequences were aligned with expasy decrease redundancy tool, to identify the identical sequences . sixty-four sequences corresponding to non-recombined and non-redundant scfv sequences were identified. fifty two of them  were found in a single copy whereas the other  <dig> sequences  were found in at least two copies, after the analysis of sequences redundancy, which gave an overview of the high diversity of the antibody fragments isolated after the phage-display screening. the over-represented sequences identified after the sequencing could correspond to clones preferentially amplified during the panning, because of their better interaction with the antigen. after transformation of the dna in e. coli hb <dig>  the  <dig> different sequences were expressed as soluble scfv and purified. their affinities for bont/a <dig> were measured by surface plasmon resonance and ranged from  <dig>  nm  to 50 nm. the affinity of the scfv a1hc <dig> was measured at  <dig>  nm with kon =  <dig>  ×  <dig> m− <dig> s− <dig> and koff =  <dig>  × 10− <dig> s− <dig> . the twenty-four scfvs  presenting affinities better than 10 nm  were selected to test their neutralization capacities.table  <dig> list of the  <dig> scfvs with affinities better than  <dig> nm

computational analyse
after the isolation and the sequencing of the scfvs, a computational analysis using imgt/v-quest tool was performed to retrieve the human germline sequences closer to the sequence of the  <dig> selected scfvs. as shown in table  <dig>  the use of three ighv family genes  was observed:  <dig> occurrences of ighv3-49* <dig> plus one occurrence of ighv3-21* <dig> and one occurrence of ighv3-71* <dig>   <dig> occurrences of ighv1-69* <dig>  and  <dig> occurrences of ighv5-51* <dig> and ighv5-a* <dig>  these vh were combined to four different ighj family genes . regarding light chains, the use of two different igkv genes  was observed: igkv1-39* <dig> and igkv <dig> -16* <dig> , igkv1-17* <dig> , igkv1-27* <dig>  igkv1-13* <dig> and igkv1-9* <dig>  and finally one occurrence of igkv1d-13* <dig>  plus three single occurrence of igkv <dig> . these igkv genes are also combined to different igkj family genes . all these rearrangements result in a high diversity of the selected scfv sequences.table  <dig> human germline genes closer to the genes coding for the  <dig> scfvs with affinities better than  <dig> nm

germinality index  represents the percentage of identity at the amino acids level between the framework regions of a scfv and the framework regions encoded by the corresponding human germline v and j sequences  <cit> . the gi of the  <dig> best scfvs are presented in table 3; values ranged between  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, underlining their high identity level with human sequences and thus their potential low immunogenicity. the g-score is another parameter that could indirectly predict the tolerance of the scfv, but it is based on comparison with the expressed genes and not with germline genes  <cit> . the g-scores of the  <dig> selected scfv were also determined and ranged between − <dig>  and − <dig>  . even if the g-score of the light chains of a1hc <dig>  a1hc <dig> and a1hc <dig> were positives, all mean g-score were negatives.table  <dig> germinality index of the  <dig> scfvs with affinities better than  <dig> nm

scfvs neutralization capacities
all scfvs with affinities better than 10 nm were characterized in the ex vivo mouse phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm assay to identify those neutralizing bont/a <dig> holotoxin and those cross-neutralizing bont/a <dig> as a complex . first, the  <dig> selected scfvs were screened at the highest possible concentration  against bont/a <dig> to identify the scfvs presenting some neutralization capacities . then, only the scfv significantly neutralizing bont/a <dig> were characterized at higher concentration against bont/a <dig> , to identify the cross-neutralizing scfvs. finally, the best scfv cross-neutralizing bont/a <dig> and bont/a <dig> was more precisely characterized against bont/a <dig> and bont/a <dig>  using decreasing concentrations of the scfv . standard deviations are shows only for the concentrations of particular interest. in both figure, 43rca, a scfv directed against the ricin toxin, was used as a negative control of neutralization  <cit> . in the presence of this irrelevant scfv, the 50 % decrease in muscle concentration was always delayed by less than 10 min, which was considered as non-significant . in absence of toxin, only a slow decrease of the muscle contraction is observed, due to the progressive, but weak, degradation of the muscle preparation .fig.  <dig> neutralization of bont/a <dig> and bont/a <dig> by high concentration of scfvs in the mouse phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm assay. a neutralization of purified-bont/a <dig> holotoxin  with a1hc <dig>  a1hc <dig> or a1hc <dig> at a single high concentration. b neutralization of complexed-bont/a <dig>  with a1hc <dig>  a1hc <dig> or a1hc <dig> at a single high concentration. bont/a <dig> and bont/a <dig> were premixed with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 5 μg.ml− <dig> of a1hc <dig>  a1hc <dig> or a1hc <dig> or with the commercial polyvalent f <dig> antitoxin . the toxins alone were used as controls to determine the time required to observed a 50 % decrease in the twitch height. no significant neutralization was observed with an irrelevant scfv directed against the ricin toxin , tested at a single concentration of 9 μg.ml− <dig> in all experiments. the experiments were run until a decrease of at least 50 % in the twitch height was observed, until the phrenic nerve hemidiaphragm preparation was no longer viable or until no more twitch was detected. control tissues, not exposed to the toxin were included to demonstrate stability of recordings

as shown in fig. 3a, in the presence of bont/a <dig> holotoxin alone , the time to reach a 50 % paralysis was 97 min. the f <dig> antitoxin  was used as a positive control for neutralization. the 50 % paralysis time with bont/a <dig> was delayed by 115 min in the presence of  <dig> miu.ml− <dig> of this positive control . among the  <dig> scfvs tested,  <dig> efficiently neutralized bont/a <dig>  at the concentration of 27 μg.ml− <dig> , 5 μg.ml− <dig>  or 12 μg.ml− <dig> . at the concentrations tested these scfvs delayed the 50 % paralysis time by more than 145 min , by 190 min  and by 95 min , respectively. the three scfvs neutralizing bont/a <dig> were then tested at higher concentration against bont/a <dig> in the complex form. as shown in fig. 2b, in the presence of complex bont/a <dig> alone , the time to reach a 50 % paralysis was 118 min. as shown in fig. 2b, at concentrations of 20 μg.ml− <dig>  or 15 μg.ml− <dig> , the 50 % paralysis time was delayed by 100 min , more than 220 min  and 50 min .

as the scfv a1hc <dig> was the most efficient cross-neutralizing scfv, it was selected for further characterization at lower concentrations against bont/a <dig> and bont/a <dig> . as shown in fig. 3a, at concentrations of  <dig>  and 1 μg.ml− <dig>  a1hc <dig> delayed the 50 % paralysis time induced by bont/a <dig>  by  <dig> and 120 min, respectively . as no significant neutralization was observed with  <dig>  μg.ml− <dig> of a1hc <dig>  the minimum neutralizing concentration was considered to be close to  <dig>  μg.ml− <dig>  as shown in fig. 3b, at concentrations of  <dig> and 5 μg.ml− <dig>  a1hc <dig> delayed the paralysis induced by bont/a <dig> by more than 227 min  and by 65 min , respectively.

discussion
bont/a is the most toxic substance currently known and its neutralization is of a major concern for public health and biological defense  <cit> . for this purpose, recombinant antibodies represent a potent tool because they can be used for both therapy and prophylaxis and they have proven their efficacy for the neutralization of biological warfare agents such as ricin, anthrax or botulinum neurotoxins  <cit> . several studies have previously isolated antibodies neutralizing bont/a by targeting the light chain or the heavy chain . nevertheless, only few of them are of human or human-like origin and they generally neutralized only one of the five subtypes currently described . it was demonstrated that the combination of several antibodies synergistically neutralized bont/a, particularly if one antibody is directed against the heavy chain of bont/a  and another against its light chain   <cit> . recently, we have generated scfvs directed against the light chain of bont/a <dig>   <cit> . these scfvs inhibited the catalytic activity of the bont/a <dig> subtype and neutralized this toxin in the ex vivo phrenic nerve assay. in this work, human-like scfvs neutralizing bont/a were generated. antibodies isolated from immune libraries were generally more neutralizing than antibodies isolated from naïve libraries  <cit> . because human subjects cannot be immunized with bio warfare agents, our strategy consisted in substituting them with the non-human primates for immunization. non-human primate antibody sequences are close to human ones and thus would be useful for the isolation of well tolerated antibodies. we previously showed that macaque antibodies are significantly more similar to human antibody sequences compared to chimpanzee antibody sequences  <cit> . thus, in the present study, an immune library was constructed starting from a macaque  immunized with a non-toxic recombinant fragment corresponding to the c-terminus of bont/a1-hc. this immune library was panned against bont/a <dig> holotoxin. the best scfvs with affinities below 10 nm were evaluated for their neutralization capacities. to identify cross-neutralizing scfvs, their capacity to neutralize both pure bont/a <dig> holotoxin and complex bont/a <dig> was successively evaluated in the ex vivo mouse phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm assay  <cit> . this test closely mimics the in vivo respiratory paralysis and the results obtained for neutralization of polyclonal antibodies closely relate to the results obtained in the mice lethality assay. the bont/a <dig> toxin used for this test corresponded to toxin in the form of complexes and not of purified holotoxin. during the panning it was not possible to use complexed toxin because it would have led to the isolation of non-neutralizing antibodies directed against the others proteins  constituting these complexes. in this ex vivo test, all scfvs which significantly delayed the 50 % reduction in muscle twitch were considered as neutralizing. among the  <dig> scfvs tested, a1hc <dig>  a1hc <dig> and a1hc <dig> neutralized efficiently bont/a <dig> holotoxin. these three scfvs were further characterized against complexed bont/a <dig>  two of them, a1hc <dig> and a1hc <dig>  were identified as cross-neutralizing, and a1hc <dig> was identified as the most potent scfv. at a concentration of 5 μg.ml− <dig>  a1hc <dig> delayed the paralysis induced by bont/a <dig>  by 164 % and the paralysis induced by bont/a <dig>  by 55 %. a non-linear dose-effect was observed. these results are promising as generally an efficient neutralization of bont/a requires the association of several neutralizing antibodies and because neutralization properties of bont/a <dig> by a1hc <dig> were similar or even better than the neutralization observed using the polyclonal f <dig> antitoxin at activity of  <dig> miu.ml− <dig> against bont/a which was included as a positive control  <cit> . antibodies targeting the heavy-chain could neutralize the toxin by different mechanisms, mainly by preventing toxin binding and its internalization into the motoneurons, but they could also indirectly inhibit the catalytic activity, by steric hindrance. the affinity of a1hc <dig> and a1hc <dig> were measured and were equal to  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm, respectively, and it is interesting to note that no strict correlation between high affinity and neutralization properties was observed; in fact the four scfvs with the highest affinities were not neutralizing.

the antibody-library was constructed starting from an immunized non-human primate. even though close to their human counterpart, macaque igg are not identical and could induce the formation of an anti-drug antibodies  responses by the patients treated with these molecules  <cit> . this ada response could lead to decreasing the efficiency of the therapeutic antibody due to its quick elimination from the bloodstream. to predict the antibody tolerance, two different mathematical indexes were used: the germinality index   <cit>  and the g-score  <cit> . these parameters compare the variable region of a given antibody with the human germline vj genes, and with expressed antibodies, respectively. the scfvs a1hc <dig> and a1hc <dig> had a mean gi equal to  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively, underlining a high proximity to human antibody framework sequences. for comparison, the mean gi values of  <dig> unpublished human scfv from naive antibodies libraries are  <dig>  % for vh and  <dig>  % for vl  <cit> . the mean g-score of a1hc <dig> and a1hc <dig> were − <dig>  and − <dig> , respectively, thus they were respectively “as human” as  <dig> and 4 %, of the human antibodies belonging from the same germline gene family present in the kabat database. a sequence with a g-score equal to zero has the same identity level with human expressed antibodies than the average identity observed when human antibodies are compared between them. a sequence with a negative g-score present lower than average identity level and should be humanized to increase its tolerance. to decrease the immunogenicity, the variable domain of the scfvs should be germline-humanized. this strategy was previously utilized for the humanization of another antibody fragment  called 35pa <dig>  whose germline humanization increased its gi from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % and its g-scores from  <dig>  to  <dig> , predicting a better tolerance  <cit> . because a1hc <dig> and a1hc <dig> cross-neutralized sub-types bont/a <dig> and bont/a <dig>  they are good candidates for future clinical development, especially in combination with the anti-light chain antibody sem120-iiic <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the context of the european antibotabe project, an immune phage-display library was constructed starting from a macaque  immunized with a non-toxic fragment corresponding to the c-terminus of bont/a <dig> heavy-chain. the screening of this immune library led to the isolation of several neutralizing scfvs. the scfv a1hc <dig>  with an affinity of  <dig>  nm, and cross-neutralized efficiently for both bont/a <dig> and bont/a <dig> in the ex vivo phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm assay was the most potent of the isolated scfv. furthermore, scfv a1hc <dig> presented a germinality index of 84 % and a g-score of − <dig> . to ensure excellent bioavailability and tolerance, the scfv could be germline-humanized and then reformatted as full-sized igg and neutralizing potency assessed in vivo.
