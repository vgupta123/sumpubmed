BACKGROUND
murine leukemia viruses  are present in the germ line of the house mouse mus musculus and of related species as endogenous retroviruses  <cit> . many are inactive and transmitted vertically, but mlvs can also exist as horizontally transmitted exogenous retroviruses . because endogenous mlvs are highly variable in sequence and present in the genome at high copy number, a comprehensive analysis of their presence and distribution has generally been difficult: low throughput data sets generated by sanger sequencing may only reveal a small proportion of the diversity. many distinct mlvs are also similar enough so that pcr-based approaches may not be able to distinguish among them. although using next generation sequencing  data can be effective for characterizing mlv diversity  <cit> , these datasets are often exceptionally complex, consisting of tens of thousands to many millions of sequence reads. these high-throughput data sets are not amenable to standard phylogenetic analysis, as there are substantial challenges for computing, evaluating, and visualizing alignments and phylogenies for such large data sets. in our analysis of ngs-generated data, we overcome these challenges by using a clustering approach to determine the distribution of mlvs in two wild-caught and three inbred laboratory strains of m. musculus. in addition, we also performed detailed sequence comparisons to determine the presence of specific viral reference sequences in these mice.

mlvs can be pathogenic, causing cellular transformation or leukemia, a cancer originating in the bone marrow and producing abnormal white blood cells. different mlvs are able to infect different hosts, i.e., they have different host specificity: xenotropic mlv  elements have a broad host range but are unable to infect laboratory mouse host strains, while polytropic mlv elements have a more restricted host range but are able to infect house mouse strains  <cit> . polytropic mlvs can be phylogenetically subdivided into pmv and modified polytropic retroviruses , which are genetically distinct but retain the same host specificity  <cit> . one recently reported xenotropic mlv, designated xenotropic like murine retrovirus  was thought to be associated with prostate cancer and with chronic fatigue syndrome  <cit> . it was subsequently demonstrated that detection of xmrv in cancer tissues was due to contamination of some molecular biology reagents with mouse genomic dna  <cit>  and that xmrv was actually a laboratory derived virus that originated from recombination in cell culture between two naturally occurring precursor viruses . xmrv then infected human tissues that had been co-cultured with mouse cells  <cit> . xmrv is the result of at least six recombination events between prexmrv- <dig> and prexmrv- <dig>  <cit>  in mouse cells; this generated a virus that subsequently infected human cell cultures. the 3’ region of xmrv is generally homologous to the genome of a virus designated prexmrv- <dig>  while the 5’ region of xmrv is generally homologous to the 5’ region of prexmrv- <dig>  <cit> . prexmrv- <dig> and prexmrv- <dig> are naturally occurring xmv-like elements that are present in some but not all house mice  <cit> .

among exogenous mlvs, host range is affected by differences in the viral envelope protein that allow retroviruses to bind to host cellular receptors and enter host cells. host range may also be affected by polymorphisms in the host receptor gene that codes for cellular receptors. in the case of mlvs, the host receptor is the xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor  <dig>  protein, an 8-transmembrane g protein-coupled receptor  <cit> . non-synonymous variation in ecl  <dig> and  <dig> is associated with mlv pmv and xmv subtype restriction  <cit> . substitution of specific residues in ecl  <dig> is associated with xenotropic retroviral restriction in vitro. the xpr <dig> gene is polymorphic in mice, and specific alleles of xpr <dig> have been associated with restriction of the horizontal transfer of exogenous xmv, pmv or mpmv retroviruses. for example the xpr1n allele allows infection of mouse cells by pmv but not xmv mlvs  <cit> . exogenous retroviral restriction is thus strongly influenced by receptor differences in host cells. by contrast, endogenous mlvs are transmitted through vertical  transmission, which could generate a phylogeographic pattern distinct from that of an infectious agent.

mlvs have previously been examined comprehensively primarily in the inbred laboratory mouse strain c57bl6/j yielding many groups of genetically distinct proviruses that are the result of infection of the germ lines of mice ancestral to c57bl6/j by various mlv lineages  <cit> . the presence and absence of retroviruses has generally been determined by southern blot . however, southern blot may not be sensitive or specific enough to distinguish among closely related viruses or viruses that exist in low copy. each individual in an inbred strain would be expected to carry the same fixed erv integrations, although they could share different specific proviral loci depending on the laboratory strain genealogy . by contrast, feral mice are from outbred populations where erv insertional patterns will vary across individuals  <cit> . absence of a specific proviral integration would not mean that a given mouse or mouse strain was free of a retroviral lineage, which could be present at other loci. in addition, xpr <dig> can only inhibit infection by exogenous retroviruses but cannot prevent the same viral lineages from being inherited as ervs.

in order to comprehensively examine the presence or absence of xmv, pmv and mpmv, we relied on roche  <dig> flx generated sequences of various mlv genome regions from different mice. we targeted five different regions of the mlv genome that cover the  <dig> putative recombination sites that generated xmrv from prexmrv- <dig> and prexmrv-2; these regions also allow xmv, pmv and mpmvs elements to be distinguished from one another. these data allowed us to compare the distribution of proviral sequences identical or closely related to proviruses identified in c57bl6/j using low throughput methods, and to determine their distribution in wild mice. our analyses show that various mlv subtypes are more widespread than expected among the mice, which may be due to the higher coverage of ngs, or to the presence of similar sequence across many proviral loci. the results were unrelated to variation in the major mlv receptor xpr <dig>  which can restrict exogenous mlvs, suggesting that endogenous mlv distribution reflects gene flow unrelated to exogenous infection.

RESULTS
mouse strains and mlv target regions
mlv was examined in laboratory mouse strains c3h, lp/j and sjl, and in two wild caught m. m. domesticus; mmd <dig> from the french island of corsica and mmd <dig> from mainland france. the inbred mouse strains c3h, lp/j and sjl were utilized because each strain exhibits multiple copies of gag leader sequences that resemble prexmrv-2/xmrv, as had been previously determined using a dna panel of laboratory and wild mice  <cit> . thus, these strains were expected to carry xenotropic mlvs and xmv-like elements. they also represent the major laboratory mouse groups: the c3h strain is part of the lathrop/castle lineage, the sjl strain belongs to the swiss laboratory mouse lineage, and lp/j represents a third lineage of independent origin. the outbred mice represent two different feral populations, since gene flow is unlikely between mainland france and corsica. the studied feral specimens correspond to the subspecies mus musculus domesticus according to their distribution as well as based on previous phylogeographic studies performed on these animals  <cit> . five regions of the mlv genome, each approximately  <dig> bp in length , were amplified using pcr. one primer pair targeted part of the ltr , while the other pairs each targeted one of the retroviral gene regions gag, pol, env, or the env- 3’ltr boundary . the amplicons also included previously identified recombination breakpoints for xmrv  <cit> . the relative positions of the amplified regions are shown in fig.  <dig>  pcr products were sequenced using gs flx technology, which generated ca.  <dig>  reads across the amplified mlv regions.
fig.  <dig> mlv regions sequenced and summary of sequence cluster information. the structure of the mlv genome is shown between two data tables, with the locations of retroviral regions that were amplified and sequenced indicated by the thick lines. the numbers with which these regions are labeled  indicate the positions of the regions targeted by pcr, which covered  <dig> of the  <dig> recombination sites that created xmrv from prexmrv- <dig> and prexmrv- <dig>  <cit> . the target region labeled “ <dig> ” was a single pcr product that included recombination sites  <dig> and  <dig>  note that there is no line segment numbered  <dig>  since the pcr targeting the fourth recombination region yielded far fewer reads for all mice tested and was therefore excluded from further analyses. block arrows point from the analyzed mlv regions to the corresponding table summarizing the clusters identified and analyzed for that genome region. within the tables, each row represents one cluster of related sequences. a cluster is defined as sequences sharing sufficient identity with each other and with the chosen reference sequences to form a group distinct from other sequences. the first five columns in each table represent the number of sequences in a given cluster for the samples from inbred laboratory mouse strains c3h, lp/j, sjl and two wild caught mice mmd <dig>  and mmd <dig> . shading of these cells correspond to the number of sequences per cluster that were identified per mouse: white for no sequences matching a cluster, light gray for 1- <dig> sequences, dark gray for more than  <dig> sequences. cells shaded in intermediate gray indicates that a cluster was unique to a single mouse. the last four table columns list four different types of mlv , each of which was compared to the mouse sequences generated by the current study. an “x” in these table cells indicates that one or more of the corresponding reference sequences were assigned to the given cluster. when only a single type of mlv reference sequence was assigned to the cluster, the “x” is underlined



cluster analysis of mlv diversity
to determine the diversity of mlvs and their distribution in the different mice, we used the markov cluster algorithm as implemented in the tribe-mcl software  <cit> . in this approach, sequences are grouped  based on pairwise similarity measures such as blast e-values  <cit> . filtered ngs reads and selected reference sequences from the c57bl6/j genome of xmv, pmv and mpmv . the different regions of the mlv genome yielded quite different numbers of clusters, which was due to a combination of the number and variability of sequence reads per target region and per sample. specifically, mlv target region  <dig> yielded the most clusters  and mlv target region  <dig> in the env gene the fewest . the number of clusters appeared to depend on the overall variability across mlvs at each genomic region targeted, with regions of greater variability generating a larger number of clusters . there were also different levels of sequence coverage per mouse, with the wild m. m. domesticus from corsica  yielding the poorest coverage, and also displaying the lowest number of clusters. however, thousands of sequences were obtained for every mouse, and thus coverage for each target region was much higher than reported for sanger sequence approaches  <cit> . due to the relatively low coverage in general for mlv target region  <dig>  located within the env gene, it was not included in subsequent analysis.

we then determined whether clusters shared identity with specific proviral insertion, such as have been classified for pmv, mpmv or xmv. sequences matching pmv and mpmv elements were generally found for each mouse for each mlv region targeted by pcr, and for xmrv in targeted regions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . xmv sequence clusters were more variable regarding presence or absence, with many clusters absent in sjl and mmd <dig> for all pcr products targeted . the cluster profiles of sjl and mmd <dig> were generally similar to each other but different from the c3h, lp/j and mmd <dig> . most xmv clusters were absent from sjl and mmd <dig> for all pcr targeted regions. for xmv/xmrv clusters, two were absent or rare for pcr target  <dig>  one cluster for target  <dig>  one cluster for target  <dig>   <dig> and six clusters for target  <dig>  although c3h, lp/j and mmd <dig> were very similar in profiles, lp/j had five unique xmv clusters one mpmv, xmv, xmrv and two xmv/xmrv clusters in target region  <dig>  overall, the mice fell into two different groupings based on similarity of clusters: one grouping consisted of c3h, lp/j and mmd <dig>  which shared similar cluster profiles, and another group consisting of sjl and mmd <dig> 

assignment of sample sequences to xmv, pmv and mpmv reference sequences
although the clustering approach is an efficient way to get a broad overview of the similarities and differences of mlv sequences found in the mice, we also wanted to determine which of the specific mlvs  were present in which of the mice sampled. this analysis was independent of the assignment of sequences to clusters.

each pmv, mpmv and xmv provirus described in jern et al.  <cit>  is genetically distinct and can be distinguished from one or all of the approximately  <dig> bp pcr targeted regions in this study . thus, when a sequence matched a specific proviral sequence we are not stating that the exact proviral insertion is present in a given mouse, but that the viral lineage that gave rise to that provirus is present.

for each of the xmv , pmv and mpmv reference sequences reported previously  <cit> , we identified the sequence read in each sample that had the highest pairwise match to each of these reference sequences. this was done separately for each mlv target region. while it is clear that each endogenous retrovirus reported in bamunusinghe et al.  <dig>  <cit>  represents a single fixed locus in c57bl6/j mice for a distinct retroviral element, such data does not indicate whether mus in general was infected with identical or closely related strains with integration occurring elsewhere in the genome. each of the retroviruses examined is genetically distinct . however, in some cases, even over  <dig> bp  some sequences are identical or are equally different from several proviruses. such high identity proviruses are not distinct enough to examine individually by pcr based approaches that do not link all polymorphisms present in phase. the presence of a specific element was examined for each mlv target region based on sequence similarity to the characterized c57bl6/j erv loci. a confounding factor for the pmv and mpmv groups was that, for several of the mlv regions targeted, the different reference proviruses shared very similar sequence identities . however, overall, individual elements could be distinguished by comparing all  <dig> regions for each retroviral lineage. it was also not possible to determine whether reads from different target regions represented the same or different proviral loci, as ngs approaches for sequencing pcr products over  <dig> kb with high accuracy were not yet commercially available at the time of sequence data generation.

to score a specific reference mlv as present in a mouse, we used a strict criterion of  <dig> % identity between a sequence read and the reference sequence. generated mlv sequences had to match with  <dig> % identity to the reference virus for all of the mlv target regions, in order for the reference virus to be scored as present in a mouse. the env region with at least two-thirds lower coverage than for the other pcr products was removed from this analysis because the low coverage would likely bias the results to negative findings. however, upon scoring it, the results generally supported the results based on the remaining  <dig> pcr products. this scoring revealed the presence of pmv <dig>  pmv <dig> and pmv <dig>  which were identified in c3h and lp/j . pmv <dig> was detected in c3h. pmv <dig>  pmv <dig> and pmv <dig> were detected in lp/j. mmd <dig> carried sequences identical to pmv <dig>  pmv <dig>  pmv <dig>  pmv <dig>  pmv <dig>  pmv <dig> and pmv <dig>  sjl and mmd <dig> did not carry any pmv reference sequences under the criteria applied, except for pmv <dig> found in sjl. these results are consistent with the overall sequence clustering profiles , in which sjl and mmd <dig> tended to share one set of clusters, while c3h, lp/j and mmd <dig> shared a different set of clusters and similarly lack or carry specific retroviral lineages.

the use of boldface indicates that sequences with 100% identity to a reference were detected for all mlv target regions in a mouse. the pmv reference sequences are those of bamunusinghe et al.  <cit> 



c3h and lp/j both carried sequences identical to mpmv <dig> for all of the mlv genomic regions examined . however, targeted region  <dig> could not be examined, as this region is deleted in the mpmv <dig> reference sequence. c3h carried regions with  <dig> % identity to mpmv <dig>  while lp/j carried mpmv <dig> and mpmv <dig>  and mmd <dig> carried mpmv <dig>  sjl and mmd <dig> did not carry any mpmv under the criteria used. it is possible that some mice carried elements that were similar to but not  <dig> % identical to a given mpmv, and the clustering analysis suggests that such similar elements were present in all mice tested.

the use of boldface indicates that sequences with 100% identity to a reference were detected for all mlv target regions in a mouse. the use of italics indicates that more than one mpmv sequence in a cluster was 100% identical. mpmv reference sequences are those of bamunusinghe et al.  <cit> . a dash indicates that for a target mlv region, the region is deleted in the reference sequence relative to other mlv sequences



xmv elements have greater sequence variability than pmv or mpmv elements. this likely reflects a younger age and more frequent exogenous replication cycles of both endogenous and exogenous xmvs that will tend to diversify elements at a much higher rate than stable endogenous elements that evolve at the relatively slower mutational rate of the mammalian host. thus, the criteria for classifying a specific xmv as present were made less stringent, so that sequences were judged to be a match if they were more similar to a specific xmv reference than they were to any other reference sequence . for example, among the reads of mlv target region  <dig> in c3h, the closest match to the xmv <dig> reference sequence had  <dig>  % identity. among the reference xmv sequences, the closest match had  <dig>  % identity to xmv <dig>  thus the sequence in c3h was scored as a slightly divergent xmv <dig> since the c3h sequence had a greater similarity to xmv <dig> than the percent similarity of any other reference sequence to xmv <dig>  in a few instances, a target region of the mlv genome was very similar across two or more reference xmvs, e.g. xmv <dig> and xmv <dig> were highly similar in several of the mlv genomic regions sequenced, and thus both were scored as present , although it is possible that only one of the proviruses was actually present.

the use of boldface indicates that across all mlv target regions, the generated sequence read was more similar to the xmv reference than were other xmv references. xmv reference sequences are those of bamunusinghe et al.  <cit> . a dash indicates that for a target mlv region, the region is deleted in the reference sequence relative to other mlv sequences



using the above criteria, xmv <dig> was identified in all individuals examined, and it was the only xmv detected in sjl and mmd <dig> . xmv <dig> was found in c3h and mmd <dig>  using similar criteria, there was evidence for the presence of the xmv group prexmrv- <dig> in all five mice tested .

the use of boldface indicates that across all mlv target regions, a generated sequence read was more similar to the reference than were other xmrv references. although in this table, prexmrv <dig> could be predicted to be present in c3h, lp/j and mmd <dig>  xmv <dig> exhibited higher identity to several breakpoints than the sequences obtained from the mice in this study. thus, we cannot conclude that any of these mice carry prexmrv1



the reference sequences xmv <dig>  xmv <dig>  xmv <dig>  pmv <dig>  pmv <dig>  mpmv <dig>  mpvm <dig> and mpmv <dig> had been derived from distinct proviral loci present in c57bl6/j mice, for which the integration sites are known. we examined if any of these specific previously characterized proviral sequences were present in our mouse dna samples. this investigation was not meant to be comprehensive as the expectation, particularly for feral mice, was that identical proviral insertions would not be identified. published primer pairs  <cit> , with one primer based on the 5’ flanking region and one in the 5’ ltr, were used to determine if each individual proviral locus was present or absent in the mice. c3h, lp/j and sjl carried the integration site for pmv <dig>  in contrast with results reported in frankel et al.  <dig>  <cit> . c3h and sjl carried the pmv <dig> integration, consistent with frankel et al.  <dig>  <cit> . lp/j was positive for xmv <dig> and sjl for pmv <dig>  none of the 5’ integration sites tested was identified as containing a provirus in either of the two wild mice, consistent with the absence of sequences with identity to these elements among the reads . the exception was mpmv <dig>  which was present in mmd <dig>  suggesting that an identical provirus is located in a different genomic location in this feral mouse.

xpr <dig> haplotypes
the mouse xpr <dig> gene codes for the receptor for mlvs, which is an unusual g protein-coupled transmembrane protein with  <dig> transmembrane domains and four extracellular loops   <cit> . the c3h haplotype was similar to the xpr1n haplotype, which provides resistance to xmv infection  <cit> . all other mice in this study carried an xpr1svx haplotype which is generally permissive to exogenous mlv infection. we note here that infection by an exogenous retrovirus involves binding to a host cell receptor. this is distinct from the spread of endogenous retroviruses which, in some cases, can be transmitted horizontally by infection if the proviral loci are capable of producing infectious virus but generally are transmitted vertically by inheritance. sequencing of coding sequences for ecl  <dig>  ecl  <dig> and exon  <dig> in the  <dig> mice revealed that, relative to the other  <dig> mice, c3h and lp/j shared a haplotype in exon  <dig> that changes an amino acid each at positions  <dig>  and  <dig> , with a synonymous substitution at position  <dig> . c3h differed from lp/j and the other mice in ecl  <dig> by a unique non-synonymous substitution at position  <dig> . c3h had a unique ecl  <dig> sequence exhibiting a one amino acid deletion at position  <dig> and a unique substitution at position  <dig> . thus, while lp/j and c3h were most similar to each other relative to the other mice in terms of cluster content, they still exhibited divergent xpr <dig> haplotypes. sjl, mmd <dig> and mmd <dig> shared the same xpr <dig> haplotype, with the exception of a substitution at position  <dig>  in sjl relative to mmd <dig> and mmd <dig> . thus the xpr <dig> haplotype did not correspond to mlv cluster patterns, in which mmd <dig> and sjl were similar in sequence cluster profile with a few exceptions across the mlv target regions, while mmd <dig> exhibited a unique profile relative to sjl and mmd <dig> 
ecl <dig> and  <dig> stand for the third and forth extracellular loop of xpr <dig>  the residue numbers indicate the positions in the primary sequence of the xpr <dig> protein, whereas the row below  shows which kind of change occurs. the nucleotide changes are also shown below to give an impression on the amount of synonymous and nonsynonymous variation among the five analyzed mice. a dash stands for a missing nucleotide at the respective position relative to all other shown sequences



discussion
in this study we generated approximately  <dig>  ngs reads covering five different proviral regions found in most mlvs. the approach applied here identified clusters of similar sequences that were present in just a single mouse from different mouse strains, as well as clusters and patterns of clusters that were shared across mice. for an inventory and description of retroviral variants based on ngs-derived sequence data, this approach had advantages over a conventional approach of aligning the generated sequence reads together with reference sequences, inferring a phylogeny, and analyzing the resulting clades with respect to the presence and absence of reference sequences and reads from specific samples of mice. given sufficient computational resources  <cit> , this type of standard phylogenetic analysis is possible using ngs-derived data sets consisting of thousands of sequence reads, although not without significant challenges. these include difficulties of aligning massive data sets to produce accurate phylogenies  <cit>  and the interpretation of phylogenetic trees that are so large that individual clades are obscured and tracking individual samples is difficult. clustering is computationally less taxing than alignment and tree building, and the results are easy to compare across mice .

results of clustering sequences showed that most of the mlv variation was in the ltrs, and thus the sequences from target regions  <dig> and  <dig>  formed the greatest number of clusters . overall, the c3h, lp/j and mmd <dig> mice were similar among all the mlv target regions in the clusters they shared, while sjl and mmd <dig> formed a second group . these two groupings of mice are consistent with the patterns observed previously, when mlv insertional patterns were compared among mouse strains  <cit> . the dissimilar mlv sequences detected between mmd <dig>  and mmd <dig>  likely reflect the lack of gene flow between their populations. ervs are transmitted by gene flow, their presence or absence depending on population structure. xpr <dig> allelic differences may strongly affect infectious exogenous mlvs, as replication would depend on successful cell entry by individual viruses. however, endogenous mlvs inherited genetically would not face cellular restriction by xpr <dig> 

xmrv was not identified in any sample, as expected of a virus that is a laboratory artifact. however, our results only partially overlap with work previously published on c3h examining specific integration sites by southern blot  <cit> . pmv <dig>  pmv <dig>  and pmv <dig> were detected in c3h in both studies and pmv <dig>  pmv <dig>  pmv <dig>  pmv <dig>  pmv <dig>  pmv <dig>  pmv <dig>  pmv <dig>  pmv <dig> and pmv <dig> were absent in both studies, although in the case of pmv <dig> and pmv <dig>  distinguishing the individual ervs was difficult from the results of frankel et al.  <dig>  <cit> . however, pmv <dig>  pmv <dig>  pmv <dig> and pmv <dig> were detected using southern blot  <cit>  but were not detected in our study under the criterion applied. pmv <dig> was detected in the present study but not found by frankel et al.  <dig>  <cit> . it should again be emphasized that frankel et al.  <dig>  <cit>  determined the presence of specific erv integrations, while the current study determines the presence or absence of a specific viral lineage. for c3h the results were in agreement with a previous study  <cit>  for presence of mpmv <dig>  similarly, mpmv <dig>  mpmv <dig>  mpmv <dig>  mpmv <dig>  and mpmv <dig> were absent in both data sets. in contrast, mpmv <dig> was present in the current study and mpmv <dig> and mpmv <dig> were identified in frankel et al.  <dig>  <cit>  but not in the current study. the presence of xmv <dig> and the absence of xmv <dig>  xmv <dig>  xmv <dig>  xmv <dig>  and xmv <dig> is consistent between our study and previously reported results  <cit> . however, the absence of xmv <dig> and the presence of xmv <dig> in the current study are not.

other findings were surprising in light of previous reports. sjl and mmd <dig> both shared sequences resembling xmv <dig>  which was the only xmv identified in these two mice. this is surprising as southern blot hybridization and restriction fragment length results have previously suggested that xmv <dig> derived from m. m. molossinus  <cit> , yet the current results showed it to be also present in feral m. m. domesticus. substantial numbers of xmv, pmv or mpmv elements were detected in the mice, whereas previous reports have suggested that these elements should be rare among european mice based on southern blot and restriction digestion experiments  <cit> , or based on analysis of specific loci known to carry xmv, pmv or mpmv  <cit> . in fact, c3h, the only strain examined in common with the current study and previous work performed by southern blot looking at specific erv integrations while demonstrating some common sequences, contrasted in several cases for pmv, mpmv and xmv elements. this extended to the pcr based amplification of two pmvs where pmv <dig> was identified in both studies but pmv <dig> was only identified in the current study in c3h  <cit> . this suggests that c3h integrations may be polymorphic within the strain. these results also suggest determination of presence or absence of a specific erv lineage cannot be achieved by examining specific integrations alone. identical or closely related sequences may have entered individual mice or mouse lineages by separate integration events and thus, the same sequences may be located in different parts of the genome.

prexmrv- <dig> was found in all samples. using hybridization and integration-specific pcr, a previous study  <cit>  suggested that none of these three types of mice should have co-occurring prexmrv- <dig> and  <dig>  and that european mus would be expected to carry prexmrv- <dig>  consistent with the results here. in each case where the results may seem surprising, they may be attributed either to the much higher coverage provided by ngs, or to similar sequences being shared across many proviral loci. even if a particular locus may not be present in a given mouse or population as established by southern blot or locus-specific pcr, similar mlv sequences may be present across multiple loci. thus strains and populations of mice are more likely to share similar sequences  than to share particular integration sites . as mentioned above, xpr <dig> alleles may effectively inhibit specific retroviral lineages from infecting cells when transmitted horizontally, but are ineffectual at inhibiting viral introgression when transmission is vertical.

CONCLUSIONS
cluster analysis of sequence data provided both computational and visualization advantages for a large and complex endogenous retroviral data set, compared to standard phylogenetic analysis. as much of the genome of multicellular species is composed of complex repetitive elements, this approach allowed us to analyze similar high-copy genomic elements even when identity among them is high. analysis of sequence clusters and interrogation of the data with specific references revealed that mlv composition is highly variable among both inbred and wild mice. elements identical or closely related to fixed integration sites in the c57bl6/j genome were found to be more widespread and variable in distribution in both laboratory mice and wild mice than expected. the discord between the mlv tropism determining xpr <dig> gene haplotypes and mlv distribution suggests that gene flow plays a more important role in mlv genomic colonization in mice than infection.
