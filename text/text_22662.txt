BACKGROUND
most cells react to temperature elevations in a stereotypical manner termed heat shock response, which is conserved from bacteria to mammals  <cit> . upon heating, the cell almost completely represses transcription and translation except for a set of so-called heat shock proteins , thus initiating its adaptation to the new environment. the induction of molecular chaperones is also seen after non-thermal stresses such as those caused by oxidative stress, low ph and treatment with cytotoxic drugs.

hsp <dig> is a molecular chaperone with classical in vitro activity of protein folding. however, unlike other molecular chaperones, in vivo hsp <dig> is not necessary for de novo protein synthesis; it assists only a small set of proteins, which are usually dependent on atp-dependent hsp <dig> binding to perform their functions correctly  <cit> . hsp <dig> client proteins include several tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases, steroid receptors and transcription factors  <cit> . the hsp <dig> protein consists of a highly conserved n-terminal nucleotide-binding domain, a flexible charged linker and a c-terminal domain that contains a -meevd conserved motif responsible for binding to tetratricopeptide-repeat  proteins  <cit> .

hsp <dig> family members have been shown to play important roles in fungi. in the model yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, inhibition of hsp <dig> by an anti-hsp <dig> ribozyme promotes cell lysis, indicating some potential as an antifungal therapeutic target  <cit> . the candida albicans hsp <dig> has been shown to be an immunodominant antigen, both in a mouse model of infection and in human patients  <cit> . based on this finding, a novel therapeutic strategy has been devised using a human recombinant antibody to hsp <dig>  which shows intrinsic antifungal activity and synergy with amphotericin b both in vitro and in vivo. this antibody is in clinical trials with encouraging results against systemic candidiasis  <cit> . hsp <dig> immunogenicity has also been applied to a phage-displayed vaccine tested in mice, which acquired resistance to systemic c. albicans infection  <cit> .

hsp <dig> proteins are targeted by several different pharmacologic agents; two of them, radicicol and geldanamycin, inhibit the protein's atpase activity with great specificity and potency. derivatives of these drugs and several novel hsp <dig> inhibitors are now in clinical trials for cancer chemotherapy  <cit> . however, cancer chemotherapy is not the only use for these drugs, as they have become useful in studies of hsp <dig> function. inactivation of the leishmania donovani hsp <dig> with geldanamycin or radicicol mimics the transmission from the vector to the mammalian host, inducing the differentiation from the insect promastigote stage towards the pathogenic mammalian amastigote stage  <cit> . hsp <dig> also influences stage differentiation in toxoplasma gondii, which led to its proposition as a potential drug target  <cit> .

paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a dimorphic fungus, can be found either as a filamentous soil saprobe or as yeast cells infecting mammalian hosts. both forms can be cultivated in vitro in different incubating temperatures, around 22°c for mycelium and 36°c for yeast. mycelium cells can be transformed into yeast by raising the incubation temperature to 36°c; and then reverted to mycelium by lowering the temperature  <cit> . the fungus undergoes a similar morphological switch in vivo: the infection starts by inhalation of conidia or mycelium fragments from the environment, which then transform into yeast in the host's lungs. pathogenicity has been intimately associated with this process, as strains unable to differentiate into the yeast form are avirulent  <cit> . adaptation to different temperatures thus seems to be paramount to both fungal physiology and pathogenicity, a fact that has long elicited interest on heat shock response in such pathogens. several p. brasiliensis molecular chaperones have been studied, such as mdj <dig>  <cit> , hsp <dig>  <cit> , hsp <dig> genes  <cit>  and hsp <dig> genes  <cit> . a boost in the knowledge of these genes came from high throughput transcriptome sequencing and expression analyses  <cit> , which revealed cdna sequences and some expression data from  <dig> molecular chaperones  <cit> .

this work describes the complete cdna characterization of the hsp <dig> gene from p. brasiliensis  and its expression profile, including differential expression in yeast phase, induction during mycelium to yeast transition and oxidative stress. moreover, analysis of its role on cell viability was investigated with pharmacological inhibitors.

RESULTS
the pbhsp <dig> cdna was first isolated during the p. brasiliensis transcriptome sequencing  <cit> . in order to confirm the hsp <dig> transcript sequence, we chose a single clone which clustered in the pbhsp <dig> transcriptome contig and fully sequenced it. the sequence shows a single open reading frame  encoding a predicted polypeptide with  <dig> amino acid residues that aligned with several known hsp <dig> proteins from organisms as diverse as fungi, plants and mammals. a search for conserved domains using ncbi rpsblast identified the bergerat-fold n-terminal atpase domain  <cit>  that is typical of all hsp <dig> proteins. nine out of ten residues involved in atp/adp and geldanamycin binding at the n-terminal domain  were identical in p. brasiliensis and s. cerevisiae, the only difference being a change from a lysine to an arginine at position  <dig>  <cit> . the predicted pbhsp <dig> protein also presents the c-terminal conserved -meevd motif. a total of  <dig> out of the  <dig> amino acid residues are conserved across homo sapiens, s. cerevisiae and p. brasiliensis .

all prokaryotes and some eukaryotes are known to have a single cytoplasmic copy of the hsp <dig> gene, but some fungi present two copies  <cit> . in the later organisms, the two genes encode proteins which are structurally very similar and functionally identical. the only significant difference between the two genes is their transcriptional pattern; one is constitutively expressed and mildly induced during stress, while the other is markedly stress-induced  <cit> . the expression of an hsp <dig> gene from an organism that harbours a single copy, e.g. c. albicans, is somewhat like a combination of both patterns, with constitutive expression and marked stress induction of the same gene  <cit> . the next step in characterizing the pbhsp <dig> gene was to evaluate the number of copies present in the genome. southern blotting analysis using the pbhsp <dig> cdna as a probe has shown only one copy on the genome . in addition, searching the recently released genome sequence drafts from isolates pb <dig>  pb <dig> and pb <dig>  <cit>  with the pbhsp <dig> cdna reveals a single copy of the gene. the translated sequence in these genomes contains three conserved introns and the predicted proteins are 98–99% identical to the one we obtained in this work.

the pbhsp <dig> gene expression was then assessed by northern blotting under several different experimental conditions including non-stressed mycelium and yeast cultures, cells undergoing the first  <dig> hours of the mycelium-to-yeast transition, and oxidative-stressed yeast cells . as previously shown by electronic subtraction, cdna microarray and real-time rt-pcr  <cit> , expression of the pbhsp <dig> gene can be observed in both morphological phases, but it is around  <dig>  times stronger in the yeast phase . these results are in accordance to what has been observed in another dimorphic fungus, penicillium marneffei, in which the hsp <dig> protein is  <dig>  times more expressed in the yeast phase  <cit> . the mycelium mrna is slightly shorter than the yeast one, probably due to differences in the 3'- and/or 5'-untranslated regions  as ests from mycelium and yeast formed a single cluster which corresponds to only one transcript; this has been described before for other fungal genes  <cit> . pbhsp <dig> expression during the mycelium-to-yeast transition  is already increased  <dig> minutes after the temperature shift, reaches its peak – about 25-fold relative induction – at one hour and slowly decreases during the following hours, reflecting a morphological transition thermo-dependent response  <cit> , which is also observed by est analysis  <cit> . a very similar pattern of induction has been shown for the chaperone-encoding genes hsp <dig>  <cit> , hsp <dig>  <cit>  and hsp <dig>  <cit> .

hsp <dig> is known to be essential for the function of several signal transduction kinases in organisms as diverse as fruit flies  <cit> , baker's yeast  <cit>  and mammalians  <cit> , including members of the mapk and pka families involved in fungal morphogenesis  <cit> . these proteins, as most in the cell after a temperature elevation of more than 10°c, are prone to denature under circumstances when signalling must occur to coordinate the transition. the very large increase on the pbhsp <dig> mrna levels may thus be seen not only as result of heat shock, but also as adaptation in the transition.

another set of northern blots examined pbhsp <dig> gene expression under some of the conditions previously shown to induce other fungal homologues. hydrogen peroxide treatment promoted only a slight increase in pbhsp <dig> expression, of  <dig> -fold after  <dig> minutes . the h2o <dig> concentration used  is far below the maximum tolerated by p. brasiliensis, which is close to  <dig> mm  <cit> , but is three times higher than the ld <dig> for s. cerevisiae cells at  <dig> minutes  <cit> . differently, two other chaperones have been shown to be induced by  <dig> mm h2o <dig> in p. brasiliensis  <cit> . in contrast to the poor induction provoked by peroxide on pbhsp <dig>  treatment with superoxide-generating menadione at  <dig> mm  strongly induced pbhsp <dig> expression in yeast cells. h2o <dig> and superoxide are among the major reactive oxygen species  used by mammalian macrophages in the defence against fungal infection  <cit> . c. albicans cells lacking cu/zn superoxide dismutase , a superoxide detoxification enzyme, showed increased susceptibility to macrophage attack and had attenuated virulence in mice  <cit> . in a review of the transcriptome sequencing project, campos et al.  <cit>  have found three catalases and three sods in p. brasiliensis -isolate pb <dig>  the fact that superoxide radicals strongly induced pbhsp <dig> correlates nicely with recent data from our group showing that sod specific activity in the p. brasiliensis yeast cell is as strong as in non-pathogenic s. cerevisiae , while specific catalase activity is over  <dig> times higher  <cit> . therefore, it seems that the h2o <dig> detoxification by p. brasiliensis is so efficient that little cellular damage requiring hsp <dig> occurs.

it is not possible to study pbhsp <dig> function by classical genetic approaches because knockouts of members of this family are usually not viable  <cit> . furthermore, genetic manipulation is still not optimized on the multinucleated and multi-budding p. brasiliensis making rna interference unfeasible as well. those challenges have been circumvented by means of a "pharmacological knockout" with the potent and specific hsp <dig> inhibitors radicicol and geldanamycin. a broth microdilution test shows that both radicicol and geldanamycin inhibit the growth of p. brasiliensis – pb <dig> yeast cells in a manner similar to amphotericin b , meaning that both drugs are able to penetrate p. brasiliensis cells and bind their targets. moreover, it confirms that hsp <dig> inhibition is lethal to the cell in a dose-responsive manner and consequently that its function is essential to fungal physiology. results similar to these have been found in other microorganisms such as s. cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe  <cit> . the use of sub-lethal concentrations of these drugs can be foreseen as an excellent form of further investigating the broad heat shock response in p. brasiliensis and in special pbhsp <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the data show that pbhsp <dig> is a highly expressed gene, under complex regulation by morphological and oxidative stress signals. this picture resembles previous observations of other molecular chaperones, stressing even more the importance of heat adaptation in p. brasiliensis dimorphism and survival in the harsh environment inside the mammalian host. this work also enforces the potential of hsp <dig> as a target for novel antifungal therapies, since the use of hsp <dig> inhibitors is lethal to the p. brasiliensis yeast cells in a dose-responsive manner. geldanamycin, radicicol and the other members of the ever-growing list of hsp <dig> inhibitors could be engineered to achieve higher selectiveness for the fungal protein. taken together, these results confirm that the pbhsp <dig> gene encodes a morphologically and stress-responsive protein whose function is essential to cell viability of this pathogen.
