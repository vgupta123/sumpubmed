BACKGROUND
a sfp is a polymorphism detected by a single probe in an oligonucleotide array  <cit> . sfps represent snps, indels or both. a polymorphism within a transcribed sequence might reflect a biologically pertinent variation within the encoded protein or a regulatory element located in an untranslated region. therefore, sfps detected using oligonucleotide microarrays designed for expression analysis can provide function-associated genetic markers.

we initially developed the rpp method of sfp discovery using the affymetrix barley genome array  <cit>  and then applied this method to rice  <cit> . a distinguishing component of our method is the use of complex rna as a surrogate for rice genomic dna, eliminating genome size and interference from highly repetitive dna as technical impediments to sfp detection. another distinguishing element of our method is that rpp first utilizes a probe set level analysis to identify sfp-containing probe sets and then chooses only the one or two most discriminatory probes from within each sfp-containing probe set.

sfps have been identified using oligonucleotide microarrays in several species. in yeast  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> , sfps were detected by hybridization of genomic dna to oligonucleotide microarrays. sfp genotyping was accomplished also by hybridization of mrna to an oligonucleotide-expression array in yeast  <cit> . more recently, sfps were identified in rice using hybridization of genomic dna to an oligonucleotide microarray  <cit> .

here we analyzed rna expression data using the rpp method to detect sfps among a salt-tolerant rice recombinant inbred line , fl <dig>  and its presumed parental rice genotypes, pokkali and ir <dig>  as described previously  <cit> . fl <dig> was developed from an indica cross between salt-tolerant pokkali and salt-susceptible ir <dig>  <cit> . gregorio et al.  identified salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive rils  <cit> . one of the rils, fl <dig>  was among the most salt tolerant.

our purpose in the present study was to apply higher density sfp analysis to a lingering question about the nature of salt tolerance in ril fl <dig>  following our previous report that the only sfp markers that we were aware of in the vicinity of the saltol locus in fl <dig> originated from the salt sensitive parent.

RESULTS
sfp detection and validation
by applying higher density sfp analysis than previously, a total of  <dig> sfp probes were detected in the present analysis . plots of the log intensities, affinity differences and individual outlying scores for a representative probe set  are shown in figure  <dig>  the intensity differentiation between pokkali and fl <dig> is highest at probes  <dig> and  <dig>  indicating polymorphism at these probe positions. a representative alignment of the amplicon sequences with the target sequence of os. <dig> .s2_at probe set is shown in figure  <dig>  several snps were detected, but only probe positions  <dig> and  <dig> span a snp. probe  <dig> was selected as a sfp by the rpp method based on a higher outlying score than that of probe  <dig> .

sfps detected in saltol region by rpp method
we explored the source of the saltol region in fl <dig> because several reports demonstrated the importance of this region for salt tolerance, and because our prior report  <cit>  suggested that the saltol region of fl <dig> may have originated from the salt sensitive parent. bonilla et al.   <cit>  initially delimited saltol as a qtl controlling three traits  within a  <dig> cm segment of the rice genetic map with peak lod score >  <dig>  . a major qtl for high shoot k+ concentration under salt stress also was identified in the same region  <cit> . more recently, ren et al.  identified the skc <dig> gene encoding a sodium transporter and demonstrated that it is a determinant of salt tolerance in the saltol region  <cit> .

in prior work we reported that all of the sfps detected in the saltol region of fl <dig> were consistent with an ir <dig> origination   <cit> , indicating either that fl <dig> received its salt tolerance from other qtl or that we did not have sufficient sfp marker density in this region to detect a small region of the genome from the salt tolerant parent. subsequent to the walia et al.  work  <cit> , we extended the list of sfps to examine the saltol region in more detail. this was accomplished by: 1) considering all probe sets including those with "_s", "_x" or "_a" in the probe set name in order to give higher sfp density and 2) updating the gene model annotations available from . an explanation of these suffixes is in the affymetrix genechip design manual, which is available from the affymetrix website. the suffix "_at" at the end of every probe set means antisense transcript. a lack of another suffix means that all probes in the probe set are unique to the particular sequence used for the array design. the "x" indicates that at least one probe is a perfect match to another sequence. the "a" indicates that all probes are a perfect match to another sequence in the same gene family and the "s" indicates that all probes are a perfect match to a sequence in another gene family.

these actions revealed additional sfps in the saltol region, increasing the total to  <dig> sfps among which one corresponding to gene model loc_os01g <dig> was identical to the pokkali allele , not ir <dig>  this gene model is adjacent to the skc <dig> gene  which as stated above is known to be a salt tolerance gene  <cit> .

validation of sfps in saltol region by amplicon sequencing
in order to confirm the sfps detected in the saltol region, we examined the sfp locations by amplicon sequencing. alignments of the amplicon sequences are shown in figure  <dig>  for probe set os. <dig> .s1_x_at, which corresponds to gene model loc_os01g <dig>  one snp was found in the amplicon sequence at the sfp probe position and the fl <dig> allele was the same as in the pokkali genotype. these results confirmed the sfp detection data, which suggested that fl <dig> contains a pokkali-derived gene near skc <dig> . to further examine this region we checked additional genes in the vicinity of loc_os01g <dig>  we found that three additional genes  within a <  <dig> mb segment of fl <dig> also are of a non-ir <dig> origination . taken together, it appears that fl <dig> contains a small non-ir <dig> haplotype block including skc <dig> , which we did not detect previously. we could not detect a sfp in the skc <dig> gene in either the previous work or the present study because the expression level from the probe set  for skc <dig> was not "present" in all expression datasets, which is a requirement of our statistical filtering method. the skc <dig> sequences are shown in figure 6c. surprisingly, in an apparently highly variable region, fl <dig> contains a haplotype that is not identical to either of the presumed parents. we confirmed this by sequencing amplicons from independent reactions from each genotype, making use of high fidelity taq polymerase . the existence in fl <dig> of an allele that matches neither ir <dig> nor the genotype which we know as pokkali could be explained by either parent being genetically not uniform when the crosses to make rils including fl <dig> were made. this notion is consistent with records now showing that there are actually at least eight distinct accessions named pokkali in the germplasm collection at international rice research institute .

correct sfp call rate by rpp method
we examined a total of  <dig> putative sfps by amplicon sequencing . among them,  <dig> were found to cover polymorphisms . among these  <dig> confirmed sfps,  <dig>  were positioned over a single snp, seven  were positioned over an indel, two  spanned one snp and one indel, one  spanned >  <dig> snp and no indel, and one spanned >  <dig> snp and >  <dig> indel. from this we assert that at the threshold of top  <dig> percentile outlying scores, our detection method is correct about 97% of the time  in a priori identification of sfps from the affymetrix rice genome array data using rna-based datasets. winzeler et al.  identified more than  <dig>  polymorphisms between two yeast strains at a 5% error rate using dna hybridization  <cit> . also, about  <dig>  sfps were identified at 3~7% error rates in yeast using mrna hybridization  <cit> . in arabidopsis, among  <dig>  predicted sfps, 97% of known polymorphisms were detected, which established a false negative rate of 3%  <cit> . rostoks et al.  used a probe level analysis of transcriptome data in barley to identify  <dig>  putative sfps, which included ~40% false positives  <cit> . more recently, rice genomic dna was hybridized to an oligonucleotide microarray to detect sfps  <cit>  with an up to 20% false discovery rate. the 97% validation rate  from our method of rna-based sfp detection by rpp compares favourably to these other performance metrics.

in the single nucleotide polymorphism database  of the national center for biotechnology information , more than  <dig> million polymorphisms including snps, small indels and microsatellite repeat variations have been catalogued. also, the international rice research institute has initiated a project to identify a large fraction of the snps in germplasm pertinent to cultivated rice through whole-genome comparisons  <cit> . this will provide additional millions of rice snps. our work has shown that the existing affymetrix rice genome array can be used to provide some thousands of sfp markers from a pairwise rice genotype comparison. because a number of researchers have been using affymetrix microarrays for transcriptome analyses in a range of rice rils, nils and germplasm accessions, existing data files provide abundant opportunities for the identification of additional sfp markers and resolution of trait determinants without additional expenditure on materials or data acquisition. therefore, application of the rpp method to existing data could augment, or sometimes obviate the need for, other markers to meet objectives such as map-based cloning and sub-mb resolution of the position of trait determinants. examples of such applications would be to define introgressed regions in nils or to generate moderate density linkage maps from ril populations. also, sfps can provide a reliable discovery component in the development of markers for other detection systems including snps, caps, dart, and ssrs.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified a small  segment from the salt tolerant parent, presumably a pokkali accession, in the saltol region of ril fl <dig> using sfp analysis with confirmation by amplicon sequencing. this small segment is flanked by alleles identical to those in the salt sensitive parent ir <dig>  this study shows that the affymetrix rice genome array, designed for expression analysis, provides a satisfactory genetic marker system for mapping in rice using rna hybridization and the rpp method of sfp analysis.
