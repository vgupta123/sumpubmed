BACKGROUND
the primary objective of breeding in agriculture is to develop plants of desired genotypes or traits, such as high yields and resistance to adverse environmental impact. marker-assisted backcrossing  and transgenesis  are two widely adopted plant breeding techniques. as a conventional technique, mab breeding has been used to develop new crop cultivars of, e.g., baley, maize and rice  <cit> . the basis of mab breeding  <cit>  is to transfer a specific allele at the target locus in a donor line to a recipient line while selecting against donor introgression across the rest of the genome. in most cases, the recipient line used for backcrossing has a large number of favorable attributes but is deficient in a few characteristics. since mab breeding to certain degree mimics or replicates natural selection, novel cultivars produced through mab breeding have been regarded as genetically safe. however, mab breeding is laborious, requiring several backcrossings and a large number of individual plant screenings, typically on the order of thousands. it typically takes a great deal of luck to produce a product of a desirable trait.

transgenesis is an effective means for improving crop genetic makeup for deriving favorable traits. breeding by transgenesis has several advantages over breeding by mab. transgenesis is a direct means for introducing a gene or genotype to a genome in order to produce a target trait. as a result, the potential to produce plants with favorable traits increases dramatically. for example, by transfering a gene that encodes a plastidial adenyalte kinase into a potato variety, the transgenic potato displays wild-type growth and developmental phenotype but also has an increased yield and starch concentration  <cit> . by introducing the hybrid cellulase gene cel-hyb <dig> into a spring barley variety through agrobacterium-mediated transformation, the selected marker-free transgenic barley produces a high level of cellulase  in developing grains, suggesting that the transgenic barley has the potential for producing a large quantity of cellulase for commercial use  <cit> . the nutritional value of golden rice is improved with increased pro-vitamin a content by introducing genes encoding phytoene synthase  in combination with the erwinia uredovora carotene desaturase  into rice  <cit> . through an agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation system, xa <dig>  a rice bacterial blight resistance gene, has been introduced into five chinese rice varieties and as a result, the transgenic rice plants exhibit a high resistance to bacterial blight  <cit> .

while transgenesis offers immense opportunities to curtail the severe threat of food shortage the expanding world population is facing, there are considerable public concerns over the use of transgenesis for crop improvement. indeed, it remains extremely controversial whether or not transgenic crops have an adverse impact on human health. at the center of this controversy is the issue of whether or not insertion of a transgene into the host plant genome or manipulation of an allele in the host genome may affect the expression of other genes and ultimately lead to unintended phenotypes. unfortunately, it is technically challenging to address this issue because accurate prediction of phenotypes based on genotypic variation and/or gene expression alteration remains a research topic.

due to the difficulty, efforts of evaluating the safety of transgenic crops has been geared toward assessing the substantial equivalence between transgenic plants and wildtype or conventionally bred plants, like plants from mab breeding  <cit> . substantial equivalence has been introduced as a standard by the organization for economic cooperation and development  and has been endorsed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations/world health organization   <cit> . however, the standard is based on comparative analysis and offers only a general principle. no specific molecular, biological, chemical or nutritional basis has been established to precisely specify the degree of substantial equivalence  <cit> . it thus leaves widely open the study of various aspects of equivalence, ranging from molecular, biological, and chemical to nutritional equivalence, between a transgenic plant and a wildtype or plant produced by mab breeding. nevertheless, it has been agreed that to be considered substantially equivalent, the characteristics of a transgenic plant must be within a natural range of variation  <cit> , a guideline we follow in our study.

rice is an essential staple crop for the world population and a model plant for basic and applied research. rice bacterial leaf blight , caused by bacteria xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae , is one of the most devastating rice diseases throughout the world. utilization of blb resistant genes in breeding is the most effective and economical strategy for controlling blb  <cit> . xa <dig>  the first-cloned blb resistant gene from oryza longistaminata, has received much attention because of its broad spectrum of resistance to blb  <cit> . the gene has also been widely used in blb resistance breeding through both the transgenic and mab strategies  <cit> . therefore, transgenic rice and mab rice carrying xa <dig> offer an excellent opportunity to assess the possible substantial equivalence of transgenic and mab rice as well as rice in natural environments.

in order to pave the way for future studies of the safety of transgenic crops, we focused on the molecular and biological aspects of substantial equivalence of transgenic rice. we adopted a systems-biology perspective and examined the transcriptome variation of transgenic rice. specifically, we incorporated xa <dig> into the three-line maintainer line d62b through transgenesis and mab breeding. adopting next generation  sequencing, we profiled the transcriptomes of four rice plants: the xa <dig> transgenic line , the xa <dig> mab breeding line , the untransformed recipient d62b, and another rice variety mh <dig> . we then analyzed transcriptome variation of the two rice plants carrying xa <dig> in reference to that of d62b and transcriptome change between d62b and mh <dig>  this transcriptome analysis was further enhanced by a pathway analysis to understand the pathways that might be disturbed in the two rice plants carrying xa <dig> 

RESULTS
a system for comparative study of transgenic and mab rice
in order to compare transgenic and mab plants, transgenic and mab rice plants carrying xa <dig> using the parental line d62b were constructed. to generate the transgenic rice, xa <dig> was introduced into d62b through agrobacterium-mediated transgenesis. the transgenic rice plants were selected from the t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> generations by molecular and resistance analysis. the homozygous, single copy, and marker-free transgenic line, or dxt for short, was obtained from the t <dig> generation. to confirm the results, southern hybridization analysis was performed using the restriction endonuclease pvuii to digest genomic dna from the transgenic and parental plants. the details for developing the transgenic rice was described in our early report  <cit> . the sample used for analysis was the t <dig> generation of dxt with stable agronomic traits.

xa <dig> was introgressed into the parental line d62b to produce the mab breeding line using irbb <dig> as the donor. irbb <dig> was bred by transfering xa <dig> into ir <dig> through backcrossing  <cit> . six backcrossing generations were made because it is usually necessary to take a minimum of six backcrossing generations in order to recover the phenotype of recurrent parent lines and eliminate donor chromosome fragments linked to the target gene  <cit> . a backcrossed line with homozygous xa <dig> and similar phenotype with the recipient d62b was obtained in bc6f <dig> generation and named dxb.

in order to facilitate direct in-field screening and molecular analysis of transgenic and mab plants that showed consistent agronomic traits similar to that of their parental line, the transgenic line , the mab line  and their parental line  were grown in the same fields in the breeding process. d62b can thus serve as an ideal control for the comparison of dxt and dxb. in order to introduce a reference to natural variation, another rice varieties mh <dig>  an indica restorer line in the three-line breeding system was also included in the profiling experiments. since rice carrying xa <dig> confers robust resistance to most strains of xoo at adult stages, the rna samples were extracted from adult leaves of the four rice lines for transcriptome profiling.

the transgenic rice and mab rice were phenotypically similar
the morphological characteristics of dxb, dxt, d62b, and mh <dig> were examined in the rice fields. dxt and dxb were morphologically similar to their parental line under visual inspection. the major agronomic traits of dxt and dxb, listed in table  <dig>  were also scored in the fields. the results showed that the main agronomic traits of dxt and dxb were consistent with or comparable to that of d62b, except with respect to the focal trait of blb resistance. both dxt and dxb were highly resistant to nine philippine races of xoo but d62b was susecptible to the all xoo races . highly phenotypic similarity among dxt, dxb, and d62b suggested that both transgenic and mab breeding strategies had very little impact on the morphological characteristics and main agronomic traits of d62b other than the expected blb resistance.

in contrast, there were evident morphological differences between the two distinct rice varieties d62b and mh <dig>  the sheath and blade of mh <dig> were light green but that of d62b were reddish dark green. moreover, d62b showed a narrower blade, thinner and shorter stem, and a shorter growth period than mh <dig> 

transcriptome profiling using next-gen sequencing
in order to investigate transcriptome variations of the transgenic and mab rice, digital gene expression profiles of dxt, dxb, d62b and mh <dig> were obtained using next-gen sequencing. the  <dig>  to  <dig>  million raw sequencing reads  for the samples have been deposited into ncbi/geo . preprocessing of these raw data  gave rise to  <dig>  to  <dig>  million qualified reads for down-stream analysis. the qualified reads were mapped to the cdna sequences of oryza sativa nipponbare with a stringent criterion, giving  <dig>  to  <dig>  thousand unigenes per sample . a statistical analysis  of all the genes mapped in the four samples detected  <dig>  unigenes, among which  <dig>  were common to all four rice plants. based on their abundance, measured in reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   of the  <dig>  common genes were expressed at high , medium  and low  levels, respectively. the results indicated that the majority of the expressed genes had low or median abundance.

d62b: the recipient control; dxt: transgenic line with xa21; dxb: mab line with xa21; mh86: another rice variety.

transgenesis induced smaller transcriptome variation than mab breeding
a screening of differentially expressed genes  revealed  <dig> degs  in dxt vs. d62b,  <dig> degs  in dxb vs. d62b, and  <dig> degs  in mh <dig> vs. d62b . eight up-regulated and two down-regulated genes in dxt were further analyzed by qrt-pcr . eight of these ten genes profiled exhibited expression consistent with the sequencing data, confirming the results from next-gen sequencing; seven of the eight up-regulated genes were indeed significantly up-regulated and one of the two down-regulated gene was significantly down-regulated in dxt . the discrepancy between the results of deep sequencing and qrt-pcr on two genes assayed may be due to the technical difference between the two techniques  <cit> .

remarkably, the transcriptome variations between the two rice varieties d62b and mh <dig>  measured by the number of degs between the two, was the largest, while the transcriptome variations between dxt and dxb was the smallest among the comparisons. more importantly, transgenesis of xa <dig> induced  <dig> % less transcriptome variation than mab breeding. the differences among such transcriptome variations were displayed in figures 2a to 2c. overall, the results showed that the transcriptome change due to the introduction of xa <dig> was significantly smaller than that by mab breeding and the variation between the transcriptomes of two rice varieties d62b and mh <dig> 

furthermore, a clustering analysis of degs  showed that the rice plants with close genetic background tended to group together . as expected, dxt and dxb were closer to their parental line d62b than they were to mh <dig>  despite the difference in the two breeding strategies, the transgenic line dxt was more closely related to d62b than the mab line dxb . these results revealed that transgenesis and mab breeding did not alter the transcriptome more significantly than another natural rice variety . as far as transcriptome variation is concerned, these results suggest that the transgenic rice is closer to its parental line than the mab rice is to the same parental line.

transgenesis had less impact on molecular and cellular functions than mab breeding
in order to appreciate the possible consequences of introducing xa <dig> into d62b by the two breeding strategies, go functional analysis was performed on the degs between dxt and d62b and between dxb and d62b . in total,  <dig> and  <dig> functional categories were enriched among the degs between dxt and d62b and between dxb and d62b, respectively. surprisingly,  <dig> of these enriched functional categories were common , indicating that most of the degs in dxt and dxb have the same or similar functions. the single functional category specific to the degs in dxt is the “extracellular region part”, and the four categories unique to the degs in dxb include “antioxidant”, “enzyme regulator”, “molecular transducer” and “death” . although it is unclear what phenotypic consequence, if any, that these degs may lead to, it is evident that the transcriptome variation caused by the degs in dxt imposed less cellular perturbation than that by the degs in dxb. in other words, the transgenesis of xa <dig> induced less disturbance to the molecular and cellular machineries than the mab breeding did.

to further understand the effects of the two different breeding strategies, we analyzed the genes expressed exclusively in dxt and exclusively in dxb, along with the ones expressed exclusively in d62b. we identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes that were exclusively expressed in dxt, dxb and d62b, respectively . the dxt-, dxb- and d62b-specific genes were enriched in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> go functional categories, respectively . interestingly, the  <dig> categories enriched in the dxt-specific genes were also enriched in the dxb- and d62b-specific genes, and the  <dig> categories enriched in the d62b-specific genes were enriched in the dxb-specific genes as well . this result indicated that although there were a large number of genes expressed exclusively in these plants, they carried the same or similar molecular and/or cellular functions, reflecting the functional elasticity and robustness of these genes. on the other hand, comparing with the genes expressed in the parental line, the genes expressed exclusively in dxt lost functions in  <dig> categories, while the genes expressed exclusively in dxb gained additional functions in  <dig> categories. it is possible that these lost and gained functions may be compensated for by the genes commonly expressed in these three rice plants. nevertheless, this plant-specific gene function analysis also indicated that the perturbation to the molecular and cellular functions induced by transgenesis has a smaller or compatible scale than by mab breeding.

genes exclusively expressed in transgenic rice functioned in pathogen defense
among the dxt-specific genes,  <dig> encoded transposons and retrotransposons, supporting the notion that mobile elements are typically activated during genetic transformation  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> dxt-specific genes encoded protein kinases, receptor-like protein kinases , or oswak receptor-like protein kinases that have been implicated in stress/defense signaling-signal perception and signal transduction, which are consistent with the existing results that show that protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation play an important role in xa <dig> induced gene regulation in response to pathogen invasion  <cit> . the remaining dxt-specific genes included  <dig> genes encoding transporter ,  <dig> genes encoding putative transcription factors , and  <dig> myb family transcription factors),  <dig> dxt-specific expressed genes encoding resistance or resistance-like proteins  and  <dig> genes encoding dna methylation related proteins. dna methylation has been reported to affect rice resistance response  <cit> . the ap2/erf family is a large family of plant specific transcription factors that share a well-conserved dna-binding domain that has been reported to activate the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes via specific binding to the dehydration-responsive element/c-repeat  cis-acting element in their promoters  <cit> . the myb family has key transcription factors for controlling plant development and response to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . taken together, these results strongly suggested that transgenesis of xa <dig> affected mainly those genes that were involved in pathways related to stress response.

compatible observations were also made on the genes expressed exclusively in dxb, i.e., these genes had the same or similar functions as those exclusively expressed in dxt. among the dxb-specific genes,  <dig> encoded transposons and retrotransposons and  <dig> encoded protein kinases, receptor-like protein kinases  or oswak receptor-like protein kinases. the remaining dxb-specific genes included  <dig> genes that encode transporters,  <dig> that encode putative transcription factors ,  <dig> that encode resistance or resistance-like proteins , and  <dig> that encode dna methylation-related proteins.

most pathways perturbed by transgenesis were also disturbed by mab breeding
our final step of the comparative study of transcriptome variation was a pathways analysis on the degs in dxt and the degs in dxb. to this end, the degs in these two plants were mapped to the pathways in the kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes  database and searched for significantly enriched kegg pathways that were potentially affected by gene expression variation  <cit> . among the degs in dxt and dxb,  <dig> and  <dig> were annotated on kegg pathways, respectively. in comparison, more degs, i.e.,  <dig>  between mh <dig> and d62b were mapped to kegg pathways. with a statistical significance of p≤ <dig> ;  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> signaling pathways were abundant among the degs of dxt, dxb and mh <dig>  respectively . seven of the  <dig> significantly enriched pathways in the transgenic rice were also significantly affected in the mab rice. the rest four pathways  were also detected in the mab rice but at a less significant level above the cutoff threshold . specifically, “carotenoid biosynthesis”, “regulation of autophagy”, “arachidonic acid metabolism”, and “anthocyanin biosynthesis” had p-values of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  respectively in the mab rice.

listed are significantly enriched kegg terms with cutoff of p ≤  <dig> . “√” means significantly affected pathway. note that the four pathways enriched in dxt but not listed under dxb in the table were also enriched in dxb at a less significant level .

discussion
mab breeding is a well accepted breeding technology for production of safe crops. comparing crops produced from transgenesis and mab breeding thus offers a viable approach to assessing the potential impact that transgenic crops might have on human health. as a general principle, substantial equivalence  <cit>  can be followed to assess the safety of transgenic crops. using this principle as a guideline and yardstick, various aspects of substantial equivalence, e.g., molecular, biological, chemical and nutritional equivalence, can be examined. taking a systems-biology perspective, we focused on molecular and biological equivalences between transgenic crops and plants from mab breeding in the current study. this was done by contrasting transcriptome variations of a transgenic rice and a rice by mab breeding. as a caveat, any results from such a study should not be interpreted to directly address the safety of transgenic plants. but rather, in addition to gaining insights, at a genome scale, into the biological processes and pathways that might be perturbed by transgenesis, such results can be used to pave the way for further study of chemical and nutritional equivalence.

adopting the above view point and taking xa <dig>  the most widely used resistance gene to rice bacterial leaf blight, as the target gene, we studied the phenotype and transcriptome differences between the transgenic and mab rice carrying xa <dig>  included in our expriment system were a transgenic rice  and a mab rice  that were developed from the same parental line d62b. dxt was identical to d62b except the key xa <dig> gene. the genetic makeup of dxb, through careful selection over six generations of backcrossing to d62b, was almost identical to that of d62b. therefore, with exception of the specific breeding techniques used, dxt and dxb carried nearly identical genetic materials, making them ideal for the comparison of the two breeding techniques. a critical component of our experiments and analysis was another natural rice variety, mh <dig>  which does not carry xa <dig>  here, mh <dig> played the role of a“control”, when compared with d62b, to reveal the natural range of transcriptome variation between the two natural rice plants.

the comparison of transgenic and mab rice was done at two levels. at the physiological level, we confirmed through extensive, although laborious, in-field screening of various morphological properties to ensure that dxt and dxb were morphologically equivalent or similar. due to genetic diversity, the morphological difference between natural varieties are typically greater than that of transgenesis, as we saw in our comparison between mh <dig> vs. d62b and dxt vs. d62b. at the molecular and cellular level, we carefully studied transcriptome variations as well as function and pathway alterations in dxt and dxb. the scale of transcriptome variations caused by transgenesis was smaller than that by mab breeding. more importantly, the molecular and cellular functions that may be affected by transgenesis were also affected by mab breeding, and the majority of pathways perturbed in the transgenic rice were also distorted in the mab rice. in stark contrast, transcriptome and function variations between mh <dig> and d62b, which can be regarded as natural variations, were substantially larger than that between dxt and d62b. in short, the variations caused by transgenesis were smaller than that of mab breeding and were within the natural range of variations.

the results from the current study were in agreement with that in the literature on transgenic wheat and maize. for example, gregersen et al. compare the gene expression profiles of wildtype and transgenic wheat expressing an aspergillus fumigatus phytase  <cit> . the results show that the expression profiles of the two plants are not significantly different. a similar study of transgenic wheat, which carries additional high molecular weight subunit genes, reaches the same conclusion that transgenesis has less impact on the transcriptome of wheat grain than conventional breeding  <cit> . further, coll et al. uses microarrays to compare the expression profiles of commercial maize variety mon <dig> and near-isogenic varieties in leaves in vitro and also field cultured plants of aristisbt/aristis and pr33p67/pr33p <dig>  <cit> . the target gene is bt, a gene non-native to maize encoding insecticidal crystal protein of the soil bacterium bacillus thuringiensis . the results show that gene expression profiles of mon <dig> and comparable non-gm maize varieties are more similar to that of conventional lines and natural variation.

on the other hand, the experiment designs of previous studies are far from perfect. in  <cit> , comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of three wheat lines, including a parental line, a conventional breeding line and a transgenic line, reaches the conclusion that transgenesis has less impact on the transcriptome of wheat grain than conventional breeding. however, several additional genes or sequences, including the marker gene , the reporter gene , and sequences derived from the bacterial plasmid, are present in the transgenic line. the transgenic line, referred to as a “clean fragment” line, still contains the bar gene. in fact, selective markers, such as bar, are the main concern of biosafety of transgenic crops which induce specific pleiotropic effects  <cit> . in the studies reported in  <cit> , foreign transgenes are used. the current study overcame these issues. first, the target gene xa <dig> was cloned from oryza longistaminata, which is native to rice. second, other than xa <dig> sequence, dxt did not carry any additional sequences such as that for marker genes and reporter genes. third, unlike the previous studies where a target gene is under the control of a foreign promoter  <cit> , in the current study xa <dig> in dxt carried its own promotor. as a result of these factors, the results from our analysis were specific to the functions of xa <dig> rather than some artifacts of genes foreign to rice.

more importantly, our analysis expanded beyond transcriptome profiling to include analyses of gene functions and signaling pathways that might be altered by the introduction of xa <dig>  our results showed that most of the molecular and cellular functions affected by transgenesis were influenced by mab and functional categories that affected by mab were more than those that affected by transgenesis. analyzing the pathways perturbed by transgenesis and mab showed that majority pathways altered in transgenic rice were also distorted in mab rice. the bigger difference between the transcriptome variations of dxb and d62b could be attributed to two factors. firstly, the transgenic rice analyzed in our study was carefully selected to have favorable properties for the purpose of the study. in particular, dxt was a single-copy, marker-free, and homozygous xa <dig> transgenic line and also had consistent agronomic traits similar to that of the parental line d62b. the genetic makeup of dxt was identical to d62b with the exception of the xa <dig> gene. secondly, although six backcrosses have been used to eliminate linkage drag, a few unwanted donor chromosomal segments could still have been retained in dxb when xa <dig> was introgressed into d62b. therefore, the transcriptome of dxt was closer to that of d62b than dxb to d62b.

thanks to next-gen sequencing, the gene profiling experiments of our study were genome wide and provided a high resolution  <cit> . in contrast, the previous studies focus on a limited number of genes using microarray profiling which is less accurate and restricted to annotated genes  <cit> . such a large scale functional analysis performed in the current study has never been attempted before and the functional analyses provided deep insight into the functional equivalence between the transgenesis and mab breeding.

CONCLUSIONS
mab breeding and transgenesis are two most popular breeding techniques for producing plants of favorable traits. as a newer biotechnology, transgenesis has made visible contributions to increase yield of staple crops. while plants produced by mab breeding have already been widely accepted, transgenic plants are facing the challenge regarding safety on human health. in the current study, these two distinct breeding techniques was closely compared. the analysis focused on transcriptome variations in rice plants generated from these two breeding techniques and on that of two natural rice plants as a baseline of the comparison. the study combined careful assessment of agronomic traits, transcriptome profiling by next-gen sequencing, and functional and pathway analyses. two important conclusions can be drawn from the results. first, transcriptome variation caused by transgenesis is significantly smaller than that by mab breeding and is within the range of natural variation. second, the functional categories of differentially expressed genes due to these two breeding techniques and the pathways perturbed by these techniques are not substantially different. these results suggest the transgenic rice and rice from mab breeding that were compared in the current study are substantially equivalent at the molecular and biological levels. the data and results can be used to study chemical and nutritional equivalence of rice generated by transgenesis and mab breeding.
