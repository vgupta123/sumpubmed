BACKGROUND
the identification and classification of reproductive isolation is fundamental for defining species biodiversity as species are generally understood to be composed of genetically or reproductively isolated units  <cit> . two very differently evolving genomic regions are often used to study species diversity and include a segment of the mitochondrial dna  cytochrome oxidase subunit i  gene and the ribosomal dna  second internal transcribed spacer   <cit> . the only commonality between these markers is that both regions exist in high copy numbers within eukaryotes, which in turn facilitates their pcr amplification. the conditions under which they evolve could not be more different.

the use of a barcoding approach based on mitochondrial dna  provides a line of evidence from a genome separate to nuclear dna in that it is not associated with the machinery of sex and also carries several intrinsic problems associated with its evolution including maternal inheritance, reduced effective population size, introgression and heteroplasmy  <cit> . importantly, when studying closely related species the mtdna is often unable to identify recently emerged species because of the time required to separate the intraspecific variation from interspecific divergence - the "barcoding gap"  <cit> . indeed, barcoding gap problems can occur in discriminating species within diptera  <cit> . at the same time, the its <dig> has been used extensively as a tool for the identification of species with increasing calls for this region to become an important marker in molecular systematics based on the occurrence of a correlation between compensatory nucleotide changes on helix ii or iii of the its <dig> secondary structure and sexual incompatibility  <cit> .

in metazoans, the its <dig> is part of the rdna gene family tandemly organized head to tail, often hundreds of times in the nucleolar organizer regions . this family of structural rna genes and spacers are observed to evolve through a pattern of concerted evolution using dna turnover machinery that operates to spread or remove sequence variant copies within individuals , and also operates to spread or remove variants within an interbreeding population . polymorphism is usually low among these tandem units within individual genomes and populations due to the homogenizing effect of the dna turnover machinery. unlike the mtdna barcode marker, whose evolution and utility as a taxonomic marker is relatively well described  <cit> , the evolutionary machinery that drives variation in nuclear rdna is more complex - being nuclear dna that does not follow traditional mendelian rules of inheritance - and a comprehensive understanding of this process remains elusive  <cit> . however, in metazoans we observe that each gene sequence in the array is generally the same, producing sequence similarity within a species and sequence diversity between species  <cit> . the practicality of this rdna turnover machinery for resolving closely related species has been that the less functionally restricted regions, including the its <dig>  can accumulate mutations within reproductively isolated populations relatively quickly and can thus be the first indicators of genetic discontinuity between populations  <cit> 

mosquitoes transmit pathogens that cause human disease. as each species will display its own biology, ecology and pathogen transmission potential, identification of independently evolving genetic groups is vital to an understanding of mosquito-borne disease dynamics. it is generally understood that many mosquito morphospecies contain cryptic species, and the occurrence of newly identified species is usually followed by the development of molecular diagnostic tools to assist field studies  <cit> . these diagnostic tools are commonly designed around the fast evolving its <dig>  which have consistently revealed informative species-level sequence variation and are flanked by conserved gene regions, greatly simplifying pcr primer design and analysis.

the mosquito anopheles longirostris transmits malaria in papua new guinea   <cit> . this morphospecies exists throughout the major river valleys and flood plains of the sepik and ramu valleys in northern png, as well as the upper fly river valley in southwest png; it inhabits a variety of ecological environments indicating that it may comprise a complex of morphologically indistinguishable species  <cit> . the aim of this study is to determine if a. longirostris constitutes a cryptic species group by showing reproductive isolation at the rdna its <dig> locus, while co-investigation of the coi locus is used to determine if the identified cryptic species exist as divergent mtdna lineages  <cit> . we hypothesize that a. longirostris, like many mosquito morphospecies in png, comprises a cryptic species complex and so we follow the evolution of both the mtdna coi and rdna its <dig> sampled from over  <dig> collection sites. we examine the evolution of the its <dig> at three levels: 1) pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism  to view crude sequence variation; 2) pcr-copy variant analysis to view the homogenization of potential its <dig> copy variants within the rdna array; and 3) dna sequence analysis via cloning and sequencing.

concordance was found between the numerous mtdna lineages and its <dig> genotypes and reproductive isolation exists at the rdna locus for most genotypes. interestingly the its <dig> copy variants appear fixed in all individuals of each genotype suggesting that intrachromosomal events are the primary driver of rdna turnover in a. longirostris and that the rdna array is moving as a single evolutionary unit within interbreeding populations.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> specimens identified as a. longirostris morphospecies were collected and studied from  <dig> sites in png . based on pcr amplification of the its <dig> region, all individuals produced a single band at approximately  <dig> bp . the its <dig> region was subsequently assessed using three different approaches: 1) rudimentary assessment of sequence variation was obtained by rflp analysis; 2) intragenomic copy variants present were observed by heteroduplex analysis; and 3) dna sequence variation was detailed through cloning and sequencing of the its <dig>

analysis of the its <dig> rflp data
restriction digestion of the its <dig> product with the enzyme msp i  followed by size separation through a 3% agarose gel revealed eight rflp profiles or genotypes with bands ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp. these eight genotypes have been designated a-h . genotype distribution and abundance are described in table  <dig>  briefly, genotype a was only found from one site in the ramu valley north-west png; genotype b came from  <dig> sites both north and south of the png central ranges; genotype c was common and found at  <dig> sites throughout png; genotype d came from nine sites spanning both sides of central ranges; genotype e came from  <dig> sites throughout png; genotype f came from three sites in north-west png; genotype g was restricted to sites in western png, on both sides of the central ranges; and genotype h came from two sites in north-west png. no shared or hybrid rflp profiles were found and only two rflp genotypes  were not found to be in sympatry with the other rflp genotypes , suggesting potential reproductive isolation.

identification of its <dig> copy variants from within each genome
to assess the its <dig> homogenization status  and inform on the potential for direct dna sequencing, pcr products were run through a  <dig> % native acrylamide gel. discrete homogenization profiles appeared consistent for seven of the eight rflp genotypes . however, the rflp genotype designated c revealed two distinct heteroduplex profiles, suggesting that two different copy variant populations were present within this single rflp profile, and these were assigned their own genotype status . thus its <dig> genotypes could be resolved within rflp profiles by following the copy variant organization in individual genomes. additionally, seven of the nine genotypes were found to be in sympatry, again suggesting potential reproductive isolation at the rdna locus .

its <dig> dna sequence analysis
three individuals from each of the seven its <dig> genotypes were selected and cloned with four to five clones sequenced per individual. the its <dig> pcr product cloning and dna sequencing is summarized in table  <dig> and all unique its <dig> sequences were submitted to genbank with accession numbers described in the genetic analysis summary table  <dig> . cloned its <dig> sequences were subsequently aligned in clustal x  <cit>  using gap opening/gap extension values of 20/ <dig>  the its <dig> alignment length was  <dig> nucleotides consisting of  <dig> sequences of which  <dig> characters  were constant,  <dig> characters  were parsimony informative and  <dig> variable characters  were parsimony uninformative. gaps or missing data represented  <dig> sites and the gc content ranged from  <dig> - <dig> % . a summary of the its <dig> sequencing is detailed in table  <dig> and  <dig> with the its <dig> alignment available as additional file  <dig> or as a popset through genbank  <cit> .

based on ncbi blast searches , the most closely related sequences came from other regional mosquito species - a. annulipes from australia  and a. lungae from the solomon islands . this low level of sequence identity to mosquitoes outside the group led to the construction of unrooted phylogenetic trees using both bayesian and ml phylogenetic methods and produced similar trees with strong bootstrap scores and posterior probabilities for the nine its <dig> genotypes . all its <dig> sequences were unique for each divergent lineage and no evidence of either hybridization or ancestral polymorphisms was found between the nine lineages.

intraindividual its <dig> sequence variation revealed by both heteroduplex profiles and in cloned its <dig> dna sequences appeared as single nucleotide polymorphisms and sequence insertion/deletion indels, where indels generated overt hetroduplex bands that migrated much more slowly through the acrylamide gel. for example, genotypes b, c <dig>  c <dig>  d and f contain its <dig> copy variant sequence indels that manifest in the acrylamide gel as slower moving heteroduplexes . , c <dig> , c <dig> , d , and f ).

mtdna coi dna phylogenetic analysis
sixty-two individuals representing each of the nine its <dig> heteroduplex genotypes were sequenced for a segment of the mtdna coi ; the results are summarized in table  <dig> and the alignment is available as additional file  <dig> and genbank popset  <cit> . there was no evidence of intragenomic sequence polymorphisms in the chromatograms to suggest the presence of nuclear mitochondrial sequences or pseudogenes. the final  <dig> bp alignment contained  <dig> different haplotypes, consisting of  <dig> variable sites of which  <dig>  were parsimony informative. all its <dig> lineages were evident in the mtdna coi. one non-synonymous t to g transversion was identified at residue  <dig> in all samples of genotype b resulting in a change from serine to alanine. the coi data shows well-supported clades for eight of the nine its <dig> genotypes. however the clade for genotype e sits as a subclade with genotype g, separated by 9- <dig> mutational steps  from the nearest g haplotype. diversity within genotype g spans  <dig> mutational steps at its maximum  suggesting that without the its <dig> data, genotype e may not have been resolved with the coi alone because it exists in a "barcode gap" between the substantial intraspecific variation of genotype g and the small interspecific divergence of genotype e. more sampling may help resolve this issue.

its <dig> secondary structure analysis
other studies have raised the suggestion that compensatory base changes in its <dig> secondary structure can correlate with sexual incompatibility and discriminate of biological species  <cit> . we assessed closely related its <dig> genotypes  for the presence of compensatory base changes because they showed distinct genotype-specific sequence indels. its <dig> sequences were folded into secondary structures using the mfold algorithm  <cit> , with optimal and suboptimal structures generated and observed for compensatory base changes. despite the presence of genotype specific indels identified in the 3' region , no optimal or suboptimal structures could place these indels in positions that could be observed as compensatory. additionally, the issue of compensatory base changes within rna pseudoknots also seemed unlikely but could not be fully explored due to the  <dig> bp sequence length limits of the vsfold <dig> pseudoknot prediction software  <cit> . however, as the its <dig> sequence folded consistently 5' to 3' in mfold we could utilize partial sequences in the pseudoknot analyses. nevertheless, we found no evidence that these nucleotide differences between genotypes were involved or linked to pseudoknots.

genotype abundance and distribution in png
the abundance and distribution of the nine its <dig> genotypes are described in table  <dig>  the rflp genotype c was most commonly collected with  <dig> specimens representing 60% of the collection. however, subsequent acrylamide gel analysis to reveal heteroduplex copy variants split this rflp genotype into subsets of  <dig> c <dig>  and  <dig> c <dig> . the c <dig> genotype was only collected from png's northern sepik valley region while c <dig> extended across the full distribution of a. longirostris - a range also shared by genotypes b, d and e.

discussion
the malaria transmitting mosquito identified morphologically as a. longirostris was found to comprise nine cryptic species in png that could be resolved by following the evolution of two molecular markers - the rdna its <dig> and the mtdna coi. the its <dig> is a transcribed spacer comprising part of a nuclear rdna multicopy gene family and evolves through non-mendelian inheritance processes  <cit> . by following the evolution of the its <dig> it was possible to show evidence for reproductive isolation at the rdna locus and also develop relatively simple species-diagnostic molecular tools to distinguish these putative cryptic species. the maternally inherited coi, widely used as a dna barcode  <cit> , was able to show the existence of eight divergent lineages with two genotypes  potentially obscured by the substantial intraspecific variation of genotype g and small interspecific divergence of genotype e.

the its <dig> revealed eight overt rflp profiles with genotype discrimination apparent through single nucleotide polymorphisms and repeat insertion/deletion indels that are common to these regions. seven of the eight rflp genotypes generated a single heteroduplex profile with the rflp of genotype c revealing two distinct heteroduplex profiles and thus suggesting that it contains two distinct its <dig> genotypes. phylogenetic analysis of the cloned its <dig> and coi sequences from individuals representing each genotype revealed nine separate evolutionary units confirming all genotypes including both c <dig> and c2; these latter two appear as distinct sister clades. agreement with the mtdna coi on these species' groupings provided additional support for the its <dig> data, but this comparative approach may not be as informative for recently diverged species that do not show complete coi lineage sorting.

despite the incomplete homogenization of the its <dig> in these mosquitoes, the spacer appears to evolve through concerted evolutionary rdna turnover suggesting that interbreeding in reproductively isolated populations is driving different rdna patterns that have in turn facilitated the discrimination of multiple species. it seems unlikely that the copy variants observed within these genotypes are the products of rdna pseudogene amplification as we found little evidence of an elevated mutation rate in the conserved  <dig>  s 3' gene region that makes up the first  <dig> nt of the its <dig> alignment. additionally, no optimal or suboptimal its <dig> secondary structure folds  could identify compensatory base changes when closely related its <dig> genotypes were examined that would have concurred with the theory that compensatory base changes in the its <dig> secondary structure correlate with sexual incompatibility  <cit> .

the mitochondrial dna is regarded as fast evolving, but its mode of maternal inheritance can only reveal the presence of divergent lineages and cannot confirm the existence of reproductive isolation between lineages. discrimination of species based on a percentage of divergence thresholds has been suggested  <cit> , but this has been questioned for studies of diptera  <cit> . the advantage of using the rdna as a genetic marker is that it is possible to identify reproductive isolation at the rdna locus where different rdna genotypes exist in sympatry. under this assumption, most a. longirostris its <dig> genotypes were collected in sympatry with other genotypes  while still maintaining genotype-specific rflp and heteroduplex profiles. additionally, most genotypes show robust phylogenetic clustering with no shared sequences that could be considered either ancestral or a result of recent hybridization. the mtdna coi marker supports all nine genotypes with evidence of extended time in isolation in most cases. we suggest that a. longirostris is a complex of at least nine cryptic species in png that can now be distinguished by a relatively simple pcr-based procedures utilizing the its <dig> 

the utility of the its <dig> as a marker that can show early genetic discontinuity between populations may arise from a combination of interlinked factors that include the its <dig> sequence length, the position of the rdna array on the chromosome with an associated ability to facilitate recombination. the size of the its <dig> appears to have some bearing on the ability of the sequence to acquire non-deleterious mutations with longer sequences generally better able to accommodate mutation accumulation than shorter sequences. if indeed a core structure is necessary for maturation of the rrna, mutations in a minimum length structure will affect the core structure integrity moreso than longer its <dig> sequences that may accommodate a higher level of mutation. for example, the extension and contractions of helices through the gain and loss of nucleotides and indels may not compromise the structure-function relationship. using examples from diptera, short its <dig> sequences such as those found in nearctic blackfly species  show a restricted number of informative sites when examined across five genera  <cit> . the its <dig> sequences from members of the anopheles gambiae complex  reveal a low level of single nucleotide polymorphisms between cryptic species  <cit> . this study and similar studies on anopheles mosquitoes from png suggest some correlation between rdna transcribed spacer size - whether it be its <dig> or its <dig> - and the level of dna sequence variation and homogenization, with longer spacers showing a more complex pattern of incomplete concerted evolution and dna sequence variation that can be informative at the inter- and intraspecific level  <cit> .

the dna turnover machinery responsible for this observed pattern of concerted evolution is thought to be driven primarily through unequal crossover and gene conversion  <cit> . if recombination is reduced, as it is near the centromere  <cit> , then homogenization may appear incomplete and copy variants can be carried along within an interbreeding population. the rdna in anopheles mosquitoes is located on the sex chromosomes adjacent to the centromeres  <cit> , and so rdna evolution would be driven primarily by intrachromosomal events, most likely gene conversion, within the rdna array. the presence of fixed its <dig> variants within the a. longirostris rdna genotypes suggests the rdna array is moving as a single evolutionary unit through interbreeding populations. comparable studies have come from work on drosophila melanogaster, where the rdna array exists within paracentromeric heterochromatin on sex chromosomes resulting in reduced recombination that sees rdna turnover also occurring through intrachromosomal exchanges with the rdna array evolving as a single evolutionary unit or locus  <cit> . intrachromosomal events driving rdna evolution have also been suggested by others  <cit> , and the dna turnover machinery suggested is gene conversion. indeed biased gene conversion can be dynamic as seen in hybrid arthropod scallops where experimental hybridisation between closely related scallop species carrying different rdna its variants can induce rapid early development biased gene conversion  that is almost complete  <dig> days after fertilization  <cit> .

anopheles longirostris revealed nine independently evolving rdna genotypes with each genotype showing fixed its <dig> sequence variants and suggesting that the rdna array is moving as a single evolutionary unit or locus. this observation is evident in other anopheles mosquitoes we have studied and has previously provided insights into genetic subdivisions within and between putative species  <cit> . these regions may be under divergent natural selection as evolutionary studies on a. gambiae from africa see the x-linked centromere-proximal rdna in a region under reduced gene flow, which has led to the suggestion that suppressed recombination in this region may be involved in speciation  <cit> . the rdna in a. gambiae and other anopheles mosquitoes probably reside in regions that are now regarded as genomic islands of speciation  which often include genes responsible for behavioral or ecological isolation  <cit> . linkage disequilibrium between the rdna and potential isolating factors or genes under selection may have contributed to the its <dig> evolution we see in these cryptic species from png.

CONCLUSIONS
the rdna its <dig> is now regarded as a molecular key for the identification of eukaryote biological species  <cit> . however, while the utility of the its <dig> for species identification can be compelling - as seen in this study, amongst many others - it is most probably contingent on transcribed spacer dimensions and the position on the chromosome of the rdna array itself with respect to recombination frequency and proximity to genomic regions under selection. we suggest that the rdna's movement as a single evolutionary unit through these mosquito populations is the reason why we observe fixed intragenomic its <dig> variants within individuals and interbreeding populations. this dna turnover phenomenon that appears to fix copy variants within interbreeding populations provides a complementary tool for identifying genetic discontinuities and species boundaries.
