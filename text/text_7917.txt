BACKGROUND
piscine orthoreovirus  is a non-enveloped, double stranded rna virus which is a member of the family reoviridae  <cit> . its genome consists of  <dig> nucleic acid segments l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> that encode for the λ <dig>  λ2/p <dig>  λ <dig>  μ <dig>  μ <dig>  μns, σ3/p <dig>  σ2/p <dig>  σns, and σ <dig> proteins, respectively . prv was first identified by pyrosequencing in  <dig> as part of a norwegian-based study to identify the causative agent of a recently emerged disease of cultured atlantic salmon  known as heart and skeletal muscle inflammation   <cit> . in that study, high levels of prv transcripts were found in  <dig> of  <dig> diseased specimens, suggesting an association between prv and hsmi. in norway, this association has been strengthened by subsequent challenge studies and viral screenings from hsmi outbreaks which have confirmed that prv is almost always detected during hsmi  and host antiviral responses are activated during this disease . however, wild and farmed atlantic salmon have also been shown to carry high loads of prv in norway without evidence of hsmi  <cit> .

shortly after its discovery, prv was similarly identified by pcr in farmed atlantic salmon on the west coast of north america . subsequent studies have confirmed the presence of prv in farmed atlantic salmon in british columbia  <cit> , and also identified prv in wild salmonids in both bc and us  waters  <cit> . interestingly, although infection with prv is common in farmed atlantic salmon in bc, disease manifestations impacting fish performance as observed in norway has never been reported . using injection and cohabitation challenge trials, we recently examined the infectivity and pathogenicity of prv from the west coast of north america to atlantic and sockeye salmon  and whether infection would result in hsmi  <cit> . we demonstrated that prv was capable of infecting, replicating and persisting within both host species over a 41 week period yet histopathological signs of hsmi were not observed. as with infections associated with hsmi, these non-pathogenic infections showed a similar blood cell tropism and comparable infection dynamics, suggesting that prv is of low virulence to atlantic and sockeye salmon in western north america  <cit> .

the pathogenic versus non-pathogenic outcome associated with prv infection is puzzling, and suggests multifactorial requirements or prv variant-specific factors may be required to initiate prv associated disease. as contributing factors from the host, pathogen, or environment are unknown with regard to the development of hsmi, it is important to systematically evaluate prv pathogenesis prior to or in the absence of the possibly obfuscating physiological changes that may occur as a direct result of this inflammatory pathological state.

in the present study we take advantage of the apparent non-pathogenic relationship which occurs between prv and sockeye salmon in western north america to identify host-specific transcriptional responses during early systemic infection and increasing prv load. we use next-generation rna-sequencing  technologies in conjunction with contemporary bioinformatics tools to describe and compare head kidney transcriptomes of prv infected and non-infected sockeye salmon. guided by rna-seq differential expression analyses, we further explore the significance of selected genes in expanded biological, tissue and temporal datasets with regard to prv-specific host responses.

a second major objective of this study was to determine whether infection with prv of no or low pathogenicity would affect how hosts respond to challenge with another rna virus and if such co-infections could lead to prv induced pathology; or, conversely, afford the host with a protective advantage against a superinfecting viral pathogen. as prv has been shown to establish long-term infections in its hosts  <cit>  and is common in natural systems along the western cost of canada  <cit> , it is inevitable that such co-infections will  occur. one pathogen that is sympatric with prv is infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus ; which occurs naturally in the waters of western north america and can cause acute disease  in nearly all salmonid species given appropriate viral, host, and environmental conditions. in british columbia, ihnv predominately infects sockeye salmon where much of the viral replication and associated pathology occurs in the kidney during acute infection  <cit>  – an organ which also manifests high loads of prv  <cit>  and has a significant proportion of blood associated cells to potentially indicate both systemic and organ-specific responses. we thus explore the consequences of a prv infection on host cellular functions within the head kidney before and during superinfection with ihnv in hopes of better understanding such dynamics as may occur in natural environs.

methods
animal source and husbandry
pitt river sockeye salmon fry representing  <dig> families were obtained from inch creek hatchery, british columbia, canada, and brought to the pacific biological station  in nanaimo, british columbia, canada. fish were reared in 6 °c  dechlorinated freshwater under a natural photoperiod for 11 months at which time they were transitioned to seawater. fish were reared in 11 °c  sand filtered uv-treated seawater for an additional 24 weeks prior to challenge. while in freshwater the fish were fed daily at  <dig>  % body weight dry pellets . following transfer to seawater the feeding rate was reduced to 1 % body weight per day. prior to their use in challenge trials a subsample of  <dig> fish was screened for the presence of prv and ihnv using the methods described below.

prv intraperitoneal injection challenge
sockeye salmon post-smolts were challenged with prv by intraperitoneal  injection following previously described methods  <cit> . inoculum containing prv was prepared from pooled blood homogenates of  <dig> atlantic salmon that had previously been shown to be infectious  <cit> . the mean load of reverse-transcribed prv l <dig> transcripts in the prv inoculum was approximately  <dig>  ×  <dig> per 100 μl . a mock inoculum was prepared from pooled blood of  <dig> non-infected atlantic salmon and confirmed to be prv free by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction  using methods described below. nine hundred sockeye salmon  were i.p. injected with 100 μl of either prv inoculum, mock inoculum, or l- <dig> media  under 50 mg per l tricaine methanesulfonate  anaesthesia. following injection, fish were assigned to four replicate tanks  per treatment group and held in 11 °c  sand filtered uv-treated seawater  in a 5–6 l per min flow-through system. samples of blood and head kidney  were collected from three fish from each tank  at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 14 days post challenge . clinical signs of disease, feeding performance, morbidity, water temperature, oxygen saturation and salinity were recorded daily.

ihnv waterborne exposure
fourteen days following challenge with prv, half of the remaining sockeye salmon  were exposed to an infectious dose of ihnv  via waterborne exposure following previous methods  <cit> . virus was propagated on epithelioma papulosum cyprini  cells and brought to a final titre of 1 ×  <dig> plaque forming units  per ml in hank’s balanced salt solution . water flow was stopped and tank volume reduced to 100 l. virus was added to a final concentration of  <dig> pfu per ml and fish were held in the virus solution with aeration for one hour after which seawater flow was resumed and the tanks refilled to 360 l capacity. the remaining population  were mock challenged using hbss under the same experimental conditions.

four hours after the waterborne exposure,  <dig> of the  <dig> fish in each replicated treatment tank were removed and placed into corresponding 50 l circular tanks supplied with 1–2 l per min of 11 ° c filtered uv-treated seawater. samples of blood and head kidney were collected from a portion of these fish  at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 34 days post ihnv challenge. this corresponded to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpc with prv, respectively. remaining fish  held in each larger 360 l tank were monitored for 48 days for clinical signs of disease and morbidity in the absence of sampling disturbance .fig.  <dig> prv and ihnv challenge of sockeye salmon. a a schematic diagram presents the experimental design of this study. circles represent experimental tanks and roman numerals indicate the number of fish initially added to each respective tank.  <dig> )  <dig> sockeye salmon representing  <dig> families were acclimated to 12 °c seawater.  <dig> ) fish were equally divided into three groups and administered 100 μl injections of either: media control , media/blood homogenate control , or media/blood homogenate containing prv .  <dig> ) tissue and blood samples were collected from three fish in each tank at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 14 days post challenge.  <dig> ) immediately following 14d sampling, two tanks in each prv challenge group were administered a 1 h immersion of either: media control  or media containing ihnv .  <dig> ) four hours following immersion,  <dig> fish from each tank were moved to a smaller corresponding tank.  <dig> ) tissue and blood samples were collected from four fish in each of the smaller tanks at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 34 days post immersion. fish remaining in the larger tanks  were monitored for morbidity without sampling disturbance.  indicates the populations and relative timing for samples collected that were used in rna-seq transcriptome profiling. b data presents prv l <dig> transcripts per μg total extracted rna for head kidney and  blood samples collected from fish exposed to prv by intraperitoneal injection. samples from fish subsequently exposed to ihnv by immersion that did not develop detectable ihnv kidney infections  are also distinguished from samples with detectable ihn virus . d presents ihnv n transcripts per μg total rna for head kidney samples where ihnv was detectable by qpcr . samples from fish previously exposed and harboring prv l <dig> transcripts are distinguished from mock injected controls. the number of prv challenged ihnv exposed samples for which ihnv was not detected by qpcr is provided in brackets. e kaplan-meier survival curves of fish exposed to prv, ihnv, or prv and ihnv presented in 62 day time course in reference to prv challenge . in all instances, relative days post challenge to ihnv superinfection is also provided




in addition to the samples described above, samples of head kidney and skeletal muscle from all treatment groups were taken for histopathology at  <dig> and  <dig> dpc prv . tissues were fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin for 24 h and then transferred to 70 % ethanol prior to paraffin embedding. the paraffin embedded samples were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin   <cit>  before histopathological evaluation by light microscopy.

viral detection and quantification
blood and head kidney samples were tested for the presence of prv by real-time qpcr as previously described  <cit> . briefly, total rna was extracted in trizol reagent  as per manufacturer’s instructions using 5 mm steel beads and tissuelyser ii  which operated for 2 min at 25 hz. a portion of eluted rna  was denatured for 1 min at 80 °c and reverse-transcribed using a high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit  following the manufacturer’s instructions. resulting cdna was used directly as template for qpcr analysis in a stepone-plus real-time detection system  using primers and taqman probe targeting the l <dig> fragment of the prv genome . each reaction contained  <dig> nm primers  and  <dig> nm taqman probe , 1x taqman universal master mix and  <dig>  μl cdna template in a total of 25 μl. cycling conditions included an initial incubation of 94 °c for 15 min followed by 45 cycles of 94 °c for 15 s, 54 °c for 30 s and 72 °c for 15 s.

the resulting cdnas were also tested for the presence of ihnv by qpcr following methods previously described  <cit> . briefly, primers and taqman probe targeting the nucleocapsid  gene of ihnv  were combined in reactions containing  <dig> nm of each forward and reverse primers,  <dig> nm of ihnv n probe, 1x taqman universal master mix and  <dig>  μl cdna template in a total of 25 μl. cycling conditions were 50 °c for 2 min, 95 °c for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °c for 15 s and 60 °c for 1 min. fluorescence was measured at the end of each cycle on a stepone-plus real-time detection system.

all samples were assayed in duplicate for each virus and were considered positive if both technical replicates reported a ct value < 40 cycles. absolute quantification of reverse transcribed viral rna was determined in each instance by serial dilution of a double-stranded dna gblock fragment  consisting of sequence targeted by the qpcr primers  of each virus. a seven-step 10-fold dilution series of the gblock fragment spanning a dynamic range of 10- <dig> target copies per reaction was incorporated in duplicate into each run.

rna-seq
rna isolation
thirty-six samples of head kidney from two time points  that consisted of eight experimental conditions  were selected for library construction and rna-seq analysis. a portion  of the total rna extracted from these samples was purified using  <dig> u of dnase i  at 37 °c for 45 min followed by rneasy minelute cleanup  as per manufacturer’s instructions. rna quality was visualized on a 1 % bleach denaturing gel  <cit>  and ensured to have a bioanalyzer  rna integrity number  >  <dig> table  <dig> rna-seq analysis of sockeye salmon head kidney transcriptomes in response to prv and ihnv challenge

libraries are organized into eight groups respective of unique experimental treatment, time points sampled and kidney infection status by both prv and ihnv as assessed by qpcr. associated libraries, ncbi sra accession and sequencing coverage are provided in each instance. the numbers in brackets next to the group identifications indicate the number of samples screened by rna-seq out of the total number of collected experimental samples available for that condition




sequencing, de novo library construction and functional annotation
library construction, sequencing services and bio-informatics support was provided by the mcgill university and génome québec innovation centre, montréal, canada. a total of  <dig> libraries were generated from the experimental conditions as given in table  <dig>  rna sequencing was performed using  <dig> lanes  of an illumina® hiseq  <dig>  platform targeting polyadenylated mrna prepared using a truseq v <dig> kit with read lengths of 100 bp. base calls were made using the illumina casava pipeline encoded in phred  <dig>  de novo transcriptome assembly was performed on resulting reads following the pipeline described by haas et al.  <cit>  based on the trinity assembly software suite  <cit> . in brief, reads were trimmed using trimmomatic software  <cit>  from the 3’ end with a minimal phred score of  <dig> and a minimum length of 32 bp. a normalized metric of reads was generated using trinity normalization utility and surviving paired reads were assembled using the trinity assembler  <cit> . trinotate was used to identify putative coding transcripts and all putative transcripts were aligned against the uniprot 2013_ <dig> protein database using the blastx program from the ncbi blast family. annotation was assigned to each longest putative coding transcript derived from each de bruijn graph component  based on highest blastx score with an expect value  cut-off < 1e- <dig>  first and second level gene ontology  terms were compared using wego  <cit>  for annotated unigenes with highest sequence similarity to other chordates. gene abundance estimation for all transcripts was calculated using the rna-seq by expectation-maximization  method  <cit>  within the trinity software framework.

identification of differentially expressed genes
rsem quantities calculated during de novo assembly were used to assess differential unigene expression separately in both edger  <cit>  and deseq <dig>  <cit>  bioconductor software packages. expressed non-informative unigenes without at least  <dig>  counts per million mapped reads in at least four libraries were removed prior to either analysis using edger software. differential expression was assessed using edger and deseq <dig> based on the previously described protocols of anders et al.  <cit>  and love et al.  <cit> , respectively, in concert with the user guide information provided for each package on the bioconductor website. a complete set of r-language commands and the session information applied in this study are provided for each analysis . unigenes were considered differentially expressed at a p value <  <dig>  following a benjamini and hochberg false discovery rate  adjustment of 5 % . to ensure higher stringency for putative differential regulation, unigenes were only considered for subsequent comparison and qpcr validated if they were identified as significant by both edger and deseq <dig>  resulting differentially expressed unigenes were compared between analyses using venny  <cit> .

gene expression by real-time qpcr
total rna was extracted from samples of head kidney and blood as described above. for each sample,  <dig>  μg of dnase-treated column-purified total rna was reverse transcribed using a high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit  without rnase inhibitor following manufacturer’s instructions except that the random primer mix was substituted with 50 μm olido d <dig>  early time point  qpcr was performed using a viia <dig> real-time pcr system . pcr amplification was carried out in triplicate reactions containing power sybr green master mix ,  <dig> nm forward and reverse primers , and 2 μl of cdna template  in nuclease-free water to a total volume of 13 μl. cycling conditions consisted of 50 °c for 2 min then 95 °c for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °c for 15 s and 60 °c for 1 min, with fluorescence measured at the end of each 60 °c step. a portion of pooled cdna was used to produce a five-step fourfold dilution series for assessing amplification efficiency and linearity in each run as previously described  <cit> .

all other real-time qpcr analyses were conducted on a stepone-plus real-time detection system using sybr green chemistry. each pcr reaction consisted of 2x sybr mastermix , forward and reverse primers , and 2 μl cdna template  to a final volume of 20 μl. samples were assayed in duplicate with a five-step, fourfold dilution series of pooled cdna included in each run to calculate amplification efficiency and linearity. cycling conditions consisted of an initial activation of dna polymerase at 95 °c for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 5 s at 95 °c, 25 s at 60 °c, and 10 s at 72 °c. at the end of all gene expression cycling protocols, melt curve analyses were run to ensure amplification specificity.

target gene expression was normalized to the two most stable of four putative reference genes: elongation factor- <dig> alpha , beta-actin , acidic ribosomal protein  and dynein  as determined by the consensus of genorm  <cit> , bestkeeper  <cit> ,and normfinder  <cit>  software. relative quantities were calculated from the qpcr raw fluorescence data using the global fitting mechanistic model of carr and moore  <cit>  within the qpcr r-statistical software package  <cit> . corrected normalized relative quantities were then compared at each time point by t-test or one-way anova and tukey post hoc test where appropriate using graphpad prism  <dig>  following log <dig> transformation of the data.

RESULTS
sockeye salmon were susceptible to prv by i.p. injection and developed substantial blood and head kidney infections
both head kidney and blood of naïve sockeye salmon became highly infected with prv following i.p. injection . all fish sampled had detectible systemic levels of prv l <dig> transcripts at  <dig> dpc. viral loads in both blood and head kidney increased to  <dig> dpc, and then declined slightly by the end of the challenge  . mean reverse-transcribed prv l <dig> transcripts at  <dig> dpc in blood and head kidney reached  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies per μg total rna, respectively. these levels corresponded roughly to  <dig>  ×  <dig> mean prv l <dig> reverse-transcribed copies recovered from the combined portions of blood  and head kidney  sampled. these levels demonstrate that substantial prv transcription occurred following challenge as each fish was initially i.p. challenged with < 1 × 106 l <dig> copies of prv. levels of prv in head kidney tissue used in library construction ranged from  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies per μg total rna at  <dig> dpc and from  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies per μg total rna at  <dig> dpc.

in this study i.p. challenge with prv resulted in no morbidity or other signs of clinical disease over a 62 day period. in general, the histopathological lesions were few, mild and unspecific. as no heart tissue was available for histopathological evaluation, it was not possible to evaluate if any of the prv infected fish developed hsmi. however, kidney and heart samples collected at  <dig> and  <dig> dpc revealed very few and mild lesions. two fish had sparse, focal myositis in red carinal muscle, one fish had degenerative changes in red mid line muscle and two fish had interfibrillar exudation in red and white muscle, respectively. samples of the kidney were without pathological lesions. the changes observed in the skeletal muscle samples were very sparse, focal and almost evenly distributed between prv challenged and unchallenged fish and do not resemble the muscle inflammation described for hsmi in atlantic salmon  <cit> . a detailed report of the histopathological findings is provided as additional file  <dig> 

immersion challenge of ihnv resulted in limited numbers of sockeye salmon developing kidney infections
of those samples collected over the 48 day period post ihnv challenge only 19/ <dig>  individuals tested positive by qpcr for ihnv in the head kidney . prevalence of ihnv, as well as mean viral load, was highest at  <dig> dpc challenge with ihnv, corresponding to 33 % and  <dig>  ×  <dig> ihnv n reverse-transcribed transcripts per μg total rna, respectively. as seen for prv, ihnv loads declined in the last samples taken at  <dig> dpc with ihnv.

morbidity ranged from  <dig> to 11 % in infected tanks following ihnv exposure and occurred between  <dig> and  <dig> dpc . although cumulative ihnv associated morbidity was highest in the prv coinfection group , this was not significantly different to the group which received mock prv injections  . the most common histopathological finding in kidney samples was mild circulatory disturbances in the interstitial tissue . in head kidney, one fish had hematopoietic tissue with multifocal pyknotic and karyorrhectic nuclei, and another fish had few, small foci of interstitial haemorrhages. some fish had signs of degenerative or necrotic changes in the epithelium of a few tubuli. the finding of necrotic cells and pyknotic, karyorrhectic cells in haematopoietic tissue of the kidney in two ihnv challenged fish is probably a typical manifestation of ihn  <cit> .

in muscle samples, the most abundant changes observed were degeneration of white and/or red muscle, sometimes combined with increased eosinophilia of the fibers, but without inflammatory responses to the changes. also in this group, some muscle samples displayed what appeared to be exudation between red and/or white muscle, and a few specimens had a characteristic clear vacuolation of red muscle fibers. few individuals had slight interfibrillar hypercellularity of red muscle, and one fish had a focal, very sparse myositis in red muscle. the vacuolization of red muscle fibers and interfibrillar muscular exudation could result from damaged vessels, not uncommon in ihn diseased fish, but the number and occurrence of this also in fish challenged with prv only suggest that the observed changes are more likely to represent some kind of metabolic or physiologic imbalance.

ihnv and prv infection dynamics were unaltered during periods of coinfection
neither exposure or acute superinfection with ihnv significantly altered the transcription of prv l <dig> transcripts in sockeye salmon head kidney or blood . in addition, the presence of prv did not significantly affect ihnv loads  or the outcome of ihnv challenge with respect to prevalence of infection and morbidity . a complete sample inventory including viral load estimates and morbidity are provided in additional file  <dig>  the histopathologic findings in muscle samples from fish challenged with both prv and ihnv are relatively similar to what was seen in fish challenged with ihnv only. in kidney, circulatory disturbances in the haematopoietic kidney tissue and degenerative changes to tubuli epithelium are the most common findings. a majority of the fish with degeneration of red and/or white muscle, the most abundant muscle change found , were from fish challenged with ihnv, or ihnv and prv, and these findings could be associated with one or both viral infections. however, the specimens for histopathological evaluation were in general of small size with less amount of relevant tissue than ideal for detecting lesions related to prv or ihn, resulting in many samples with artefacts that could obscure the interpretation of potentially disease specific and other pathological changes.

a head kidney reference transcriptome for sockeye salmon was created from more than  <dig>  billion rna-seq reads
rna-seq libraries were generated for  <dig> samples of sockeye salmon head kidney from eight discrete treatment conditions . surviving paired reads greater than 32 bp following trimming ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> million per library which represented 91-95 % of the raw sequence reads . all libraries have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive, study srp <dig>  individual sra library accession numbers are provided in table  <dig> 

to support the de novo assembly of our rna-seq data, we used the trinity normalization utility in order to reduce memory requirements needed for assembly. following normalization this resulted in  <dig> , <dig> surviving paired reads from which the reference transcriptome was assembled. de novo assembly yielded a total of  <dig>  unique putative transcripts  with a total length of all transcripts of  <dig> , <dig> , an average transcript length of  <dig> , a median transcript length  <dig>  and a maximum transcript length of  <dig>  . these transcripts represent  <dig>  unigenes; of which, approximately 15 %  were suggested as being protein-coding following trinotate and uniprot bastx annotation analysis . however, this is likely a conservative estimate, as blastx predictions using current or future protein databases which include more annotated genes from sockeye or other closely related species may identify additional protein-coding genes missed during our current analyses. further, we set a minimum open reading frame threshold of 100 bp during transdecoder protein prediction analysis, thereby excluding unigenes which may only code for shorter peptides.

gene ontology classification of putative protein-coding unigenes which had high association to eukaryotic chordates  revealed  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> functional groups classified as either cellular component, molecular function, or biological process, respectively . abundance estimates  for all unigene associated transcripts identified in each rna-seq library is provided in additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> trinity assembled component  summary for sockeye salmon head kidney reference transcriptome. a putative unigenes identified by trinity in de novo assembly from  <dig> discrete head kidney libraries were determined to be either non- or protein-coding base on transdecoder analysis and/or uniprot annotation. b all putative protein-coding unigenes are delineated by their best blastx hit in the uniprot 2013_ <dig> database. c unigenes with blast hits associated with eukaryotic chordates are categorized by first and second level gene ontology classifiers




in addition to predictive chordate associated protein-coding genes,  <dig> unigenes showed highest blastx similarity to non-chordate and presumably parasitic or commensal organisms. specifically,  <dig> putative viral genes were identified. although the majority  corresponded to the retroviridae family , seven ihnv associated genes were identified. these genes code for the g, n, m, p, and l  viral proteins and were present in eight of the ihnv challenged libraries: s193d21nhkihn, s199d21nhkihn, s200d21nhkihn, s201d21nhkihn, s213d21phk, s207d21phkihn, s214d21phkihn and s216d21phkihn. this corresponded to seven of the eight libraries identified by qpcr to have n transcripts as well as one of the eight ihnv exposed libraries for which qpcr screening did not detect viral n transcripts . a low number of counts  were observed in all libraries except s199d21nhkihn, where counts ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  for all five viral transcripts identified. in general, rna-seq counts for ihnv followed the same pattern of estimated copies identified by qpcr. no prv-specific transcripts were detected in any rna-seq generated libraries; however, this was not unexpected, as reoviral transcripts have been shown to lack the 3’ polyadenylation sequence used during the rna-seq cdna synthesis in this study  <cit> .

global expression of rna-seq libraries showed responsiveness to ihnv but not prv infection
prior to assessing differential gene expression between treatments we examined overall similarity in global expression between transcriptome libraries independent of treatment condition. to reduce complex multidimensional resm count data into two dimensions of variation for effective visualization, we used the clustering algorithms of multidimensional scaling  and principal component analysis  in edger or deseq <dig>  respectively.

in both of these analysis, 4/ <dig> individuals from group  <dig>  and 3/ <dig> individuals from group  <dig>  orientated separately from individuals in the other groups which did not develop detectable ihnv kidney infections . indeed, ihnv infections contributed strongly to the second highest source of variance  in both of these analyses. although one individual from group  <dig> was a non-responder , this library had the lowest quantity of detectable ihnv n transcripts in these groups as identified by qpcr  and was the only library in either group  <dig> or  <dig> where ihnv transcripts were not identified by rna-seq. individuals in groups  <dig>  and  <dig> , although challenged but without detectable ihnv kidney infections, had a slightly different ordination when compared to groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig> which were never exposed to ihnv. infection with prv did not contribute to consistent library orientation and was uninformative in its overall effect on global expression by either mda or pca.fig.  <dig> similarities in global expression between rna-seq libraries. two-dimensional variance in global unigene expression of rna-seq sockeye salmon head-kidney libraries  visualized by  multidimensional scaling analysis following edger normalization, or  principal component analysis following deseq <dig> normalization and regularized-logarithm transformation. in each instance, collection relative to dpc prv, exposure to prv and/or ihnv, and ihnv kidney infection status  following challenge are indicated. for detailed experimental group conditions see table 1





prv induced minor differential unigene expression changes relative to exposure or infection with ihnv in sockeye head kidney
we compared the transcriptional response between mock and prv challenged sockeye salmon head kidneys at  <dig>  and  <dig>  dpc. at these time points prv load in both the kidney and blood was increasing . analyses conducted using deseq <dig> or edger on rna-seq count data revealed  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes  with putative responsiveness to prv, respectively . higher numbers of degs were identified at  <dig> dpc when compared to  <dig> dpc in both analyses; however, none of the unigenes identified as differentially expressed at  <dig> dpc were shared with those identified at  <dig> dpc. with respect to the  <dig> degs identified by deseq <dig>  many appeared to be non-protein coding. of the protein encoding genes, few appeared directly related to known antiviral pathways and normalized counts tended to be highly variable between individuals. when we considered only those genes which were shared between both deseq <dig> and edger analyses  <dig> degs were identified. this represented  <dig>  % out of the  <dig>  pre-filtered unigene dataset used for each analysis. of these, most  appeared to be non-protein coding . the protein encoding genes had blastx annotations as laminin subunit beta- <dig> and nebulin at  <dig> dpc, and ependymin and 18 s rrna at  <dig> dpc.fig.  <dig> differential unigenes expression in response to viral infections. venn diagrams present the number of discrete and shared differentially expressed  unigenes identified by either deseq <dig> , edger , or those common  to both analyses. analyses were conducted using a reference transcriptome containing only genes with > <dig>  cpm present in at least four libraries. treatment-specific comparisons are presented as related to  prv infection,  ihnv exposure and/or infection, or  those specific to prv and ihnv co-infection. in each instance, collection relative to dpc prv, challenge relative to prv and/or ihnv, and ihnv kidney infection status  following exposure are indicated along with the experimental condition group number

the low number of genes that were responsive to prv infection was in strong contrast to the well-developed transcriptional responses seen following challenge with ihnv. at  <dig> dpc ihnv, there was as yet no morbidity as a result of ihnv; however, the highest prevalence and abundance of ihnv transcripts was observed at this time point in both prv blood injected  and prv- blood injected  challenged groups . the number of putative degs that were common to both deseq <dig> and edger analysis in response to ihnv exposure or kidney infection was  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively, . for the purpose of this manuscript, we give only brief focus to these differential comparisons, which encompass group  <dig>  versus  <dig>  and group  <dig> verses  <dig> . a more complete analysis of the ihnv responsiveness of this transcriptome is to follow in a separate manuscript.

prior infection with prv appeared to have a negligible effect on the transcriptional response of head kidney following exposure or infection with ihnv. only two degs specific to prv/ihnv coinfection were identified by combined edger and deseq <dig> analysis .

qpcr confirmed elevated transcription of ependymin and not classic antiviral or inflammatory genes during early prv infection
of the  <dig> rna-seq unigenes identified with putative prv responsiveness , we selected four of the six unigenes with protein-coding annotation for qpcr validation: nebulin  at  <dig> dpc prv, ependymin  at  <dig> dpc prv, and matrix metalloproteinase- <dig>  and histidine ammonia-lyase  at  <dig> dpc prv/ <dig> dpc ihnv. expression of these genes by qpcr in reference to two stable housekeeping genes  showed that epd had significant differential regulation in response to prv at  <dig> dpc. this validation was further confirmed in an expanded sample set which included an additional four l- <dig> mock infected controls . differential regulation of the other three selected genes was not supported by qpcr in either the original or an expanded sample set.fig.  <dig> comparative rna-seq and qpcr calculated expression of prv responsive genes. for each select prv responsive unigene, deseq <dig> normalized counts  are presented alongside relative quantities assessed by qpcr from the same samples used to prepare rna-seq libraries  or with additional samples not incorporated into rna-seq analysis where available  normalized to two stable reference genes. samples not included in rna-seq but with identical condition-specific parameters are indicated . for groups which received mock prv injections, samples which received l- <dig> media injections  are distinguished from those which received blood homogenate injections . significant differential expression between experimental groups are indicated at p <  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   by t-test or at p <  <dig>  by anova with post hoc tukey test where appropriate. group 1: mock; group 2: prv; group 3: mock; group 4: ihnv exposed qpcr-; group 5: ihnv exposed qpcr+; group 6: prv; group 7: prv/ihnv exposed qpcr-; group 8: prv/ihnv exposed qpcr+ 




in addition, we further confirmed the apparent lack of antiviral or inflammatory responses to infection with prv by examining the gene expression of three immune-associated proteins: the classical interferon viral response protein myxovirus resistence protein  <dig> , the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1β , and the inflammatory chemokine interleukin  <dig>  at  <dig> dpc prv. there was no significant difference in the expression of these genes in response to prv infection alone  or when prv infected fish were exposed but not infected with ihnv  . there was a high level of variability in expression of all three genes in fish that were infected with ihnv regardless of their prv infection status. when compared to groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  there was significantly higher expression of mx in ihnv infected sockeye  regardless of prv infection status, whereas the expression of il-1β and il- <dig> was not significantly different as a result of ihnv exposure and appeared more responsive to those kidney samples with detectable ihnv infections.fig.  <dig> rna-seq and qpcr expression of select antiviral and inflammatory response genes. deseq <dig> normalized counts of three immune response genes  are presented alongside relative quantities for the same samples assessed by qpcr  or with additional samples where available . samples with identical condition-specific parameters to those tested by rna-seq are indicated . for groups which received mock prv injections, samples which received l- <dig> media injections  are distinguished from those which received blood homogenate injections . significant differential expression between groups is indicated at p <  <dig>  by anova and post hoc tukey test. group 3: mock; group 4: ihnv exposed qpcr-; group 5: ihnv exposed qpcr+; group 6: prv; group 7: prv/ihnv exposed qpcr-; group 8: prv/ihnv exposed qpcr+ 




during a preliminary deg analysis, we used deseq  rather than deseq <dig> in conjunction with edger to screen unigenes without low-count filtration. this resulted in an alternate set of putative prv responsive degs than those subsequently identified by deseq <dig> and edger using the prefiltered unigene dataset presented above. specifically, this preliminary analysis identified  <dig> and  <dig> degs at  <dig> and  <dig> dpc prv, respectively . no degs were shared between  <dig> and 21 day time points in this preliminary analysis, and only two unigenes were common to both the preliminary and final analyses: nebu and epd, for which only epd was validated by qpcr . nevertheless, nine additional unigenes of potential immune relevance were also screened by qpcr in an expanded early time point sample set . of these, three genes were identified with putative prv responsiveness for at least one time point, although all were below a twofold variation from mock injected controls and were not pursued further in this study . a fourth gene, cluster of differentiation- <dig> , also showed potential prv responsiveness at  <dig> dpc as it was not observed to be expressed in any of the four prv challenged kidney samples but was present in three of the four mock challenged samples. however, further exploration of cd <dig> responsiveness to prv was not undertaken in this study due to its inconsistent expression in kidney samples across all temporal treatment groups .

ependymin expression was confined to early prv infection in kidney but not blood and was followed by a later antiviral response
quantitative pcr confirmed elevated epd transcription but not mx at  <dig> dpc prv. nevertheless, we further examined the transcription of these genes at both earlier and later time points in an attempt to better understand the temporal significance of their transcription . this identified that increased expression of epd was only observed at the  <dig> dpc sampling time point. the expression of mx during prv infection remained comparable to mock infected controls for sampling time points out to  <dig> dpc; a period marked by significant increases in systemic viral transcripts representing the major period of dissemination which we designate as the early phase of infection. however, at  <dig> dpc prv an approximate eleven-fold increase in mx was observed in prv infected individuals . this time point corresponds to the highest levels of prv l <dig> transcripts noted in this study which we believe represents a mature phase of viral infection, although it should be noted that a period of 4 weeks elapsed between this and the subsequent sampling event which obscures precise resolution for the timing of the peak in viral loads. nevertheless, the elevated expression of both these genes was observed to be transient during persistent prv infection as neither epd nor mx was differentially expressed at the termination of the 62 day prv challenge.fig.  <dig> expression of ependymin and myxovirus resistance protein following prv challenge. a mean  fold change in transcriptional expression of ependymin  and myxovirus resistance protein  in prv infected samples is presented relative to time-matched mock infected controls at seven discrete time points following prv injection challenge. the dotted lines represent a minimum fold change  suggestive of biological significance. b constitutive expression of epd in proportion to β-actin is provided for head kidney , blood , heart , and skeletal muscle  from prv and ihnv free sockeye salmon . visualization of qpcr products for epd following  <dig> amplification cycles from comparable amounts of total extracted rna  is also provided




to identify if prv associated epd expression was blood or kidney specific, we further attempted to evaluate epd expression by qpcr in peripheral blood of sampled fish used to demonstrate kidney expression. no amplification occurred in 35– <dig> cycles of qprc in either prv infected or non-infected blood cell populations . additional qpcr analysis of tissues from six non-prv infected individuals revealed that epd was constitutively expressed in the kidney, heart and skeletal muscle of sockeye salmon but not in peripheral blood .

discussion
sockeye salmon have previously been shown to develop considerable blood and kidney infections following cohabitation with prv infected atlantic salmon  <cit> . here we confirm that sockeye develop similar infections following i.p. injection of prv prepared from infected atlantic salmon blood. as with previous work, no weight loss, morbidity or pathology could be attributed to the presence of prv in sockeye during this study. these results supports a growing body of evidence that prv is infectious but non-pathogenic to pacific salmon in western north america  <cit> . nevertheless, even in norway where prv has been associated with disease in atlantic salmon, the widespread prevalence of virus in non-diseased fish, sometimes at high viral load  <cit>  indicates that much is still unknown with regard to prv pathogenicity; particularly concerning mechanisms involved for inducing pathology.

in this study, we used rna-seq technologies to develop a reference transcriptome for sockeye salmon head kidney. the trinity de novo assembly platform used here has been shown to resolve closely paralogous genes and polymorphic transcripts in a broad range of organisms  <cit> , including an atlantic salmon leukocyte cell line  <cit> , and is currently considered the forerunning tool for vertebrate transcriptome assembly in the absence of a reference genome  <cit> . to our knowledge this is the first rna-seq transcriptome dataset for sockeye salmon, and provides an important genetic reference for this ecologically and economically important pacific salmon species. the total number of unigenes identified here  is comparable to the number of unigenes reported from the de novo assembly of a multi-tissue transcriptome of catfish   <cit> ; and although a higher proportion of catfish genes was initially identified as protein coding relative to sockeye , this is likely due to differences in categorizing isoforms during assembly  <cit> . indeed, the number of putative protein coding genes identified herein  is consistent with those identified in the notochord transcriptome   <cit>  and whole-body transcriptomes   <cit>  of atlantic salmon using genome guided assembly. additionally, an all-by-all blastn search of the current sockeye sequences against the latest salmon repeat database provided by the university of victoria consortium for genomics research on all salmon project  revealed at least  <dig>  non-redundant unigenes . this is higher than the quantity of unique protein encoding genes identified within the catfish transcriptome   <cit>  and is consistent with the 4r salmonid-specific whole-genome duplication  <cit>  .

we further identify the sockeye kidney transcriptome to be highly responsive to the aquatic single-stranded rna rhabdovirus ihnv. a large degree of variance in global gene expression could be attributed to ihnv infection at  <dig> dpc and more than  <dig>  unigenes showed putative differential expression following exposure to waterborne virus. this included significant induction of antiviral  and inflammatory  associated genes as assessed by qpcr, which is consistent with previous observations of ihnv infections of rainbow trout   <cit> , and is suggestive that both type-i interferon and nf-κb cellular response pathways are initiated during early ihnv kidney infection. nevertheless, most of the global changes in sockeye gene expression caused by ihnv have yet to be explored and we are currently expanding our investigations regarding the ihnv responsiveness of this transcriptome. we intend to provide further details regarding cell signalling pathways and examine the importance of differentially regulated non-protein encoding transcripts in a subsequent manuscript.

in stark contrast to the well-developed responses generated against ihnv, prv appeared to cause almost no kidney-specific gene expression changes in sockeye at either  <dig> or 3 weeks post challenge . the  <dig> putative prv-associated degs identified in this study account for only  <dig>  % of the unigenes used in the analysis and none of the genes identified as differentially expressed at  <dig> dpc were shared with  <dig> dpc. the majority of degs identified appear to be non-protein encoding and for those which had blastx annotations  only ependymin has currently been validated by qpcr.

ependymin is a glycoprotein that was originally discovered in the cerebrospinal fluid of goldfish  <cit>  and is believed to be involved in learning processes  <cit>  and behaviour  <cit> . more recently however, a number of epd paralogues have been identified in a variety of other vertebrate organs, particularly those of fish, although their functions are largely unknown  <cit> . here, we identify that at least one epd gene is constitutively expressed in kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle of sockeye salmon but not in peripheral blood . we also identified this gene to be the only qpcr-validated differentially expressed protein coding gene responsive to early prv infection in head kidney tissues. interestingly, epd expression has also been shown to be upregulated in the liver of atlantic salmon following exposure to the bacterial pathogen aeromonas salmonicida  <cit> , in the liver of medaka  exposed to dioxin  <cit> , and in the distal intestine of atlantic salmon fed camelina-derived feeds  <cit> ; suggesting the transcriptional regulation of epn may be involved in immunological, inflammatory, or cellular repair responses. however, as neither immunological, inflammatory, cellular repair, nor indeed any other transcriptional pathway appeared to correspond to epn expression in this study its biological role in response to prv appears limited.

in a previous prv challenge study with atlantic salmon, we identified only modest and/or questionable increases  in gene expression of the classic antiviral response protein mx during early prv infection following i.p. injection challenge in both blood and kidney during log-linear viral amplification  <cit> . here we confirm a lack of an mx transcriptional response during early prv infection in sockeye kidney and further identify a lack of other antiviral transcriptional responses during this period of significant increasing viral load. together, these studies indicate that prv is able to evade or block host responses during primary infection, amplification and hematogenous dissemination within salmonids of western north america during non-pathogenic infection.

interestingly, an absence of host antiviral signalling during early systemic prv infections may not be exclusive to non-pathogenic conditions. dahle et al.  <cit>  examined the transcriptional response of atlantic salmon erythrocytes to infection with prv using samples obtained from a cohabitation challenge conducted by finstad et al.  <cit>  which resulted in a first detection of prv at  <dig> wpc and histological signs of hsmi at  <dig> wpc when blood prv loads were at their maximum. microarray analysis conducted on peripheral erythrocyte samples collected at  <dig> and  <dig> wpc reported upregulation of a large number of viral responsive genes and down-regulation of non-immune related genes in prv infected groups at both time points; however, qpcr validation of antiviral genes associated with the interferon response  as well as the immuno-regulatory genes interleukin- <dig> and suppressor of cytokine signaling- <dig> did not identify significant responsiveness of these genes at  <dig> wpc relative to controls. at  <dig> wpc, when 4/ <dig> fish sampled had histopathological signs of hsmi and prv loads were highest, significant induction of these genes  was observed although variability between individuals appeared high  <cit> .

in our present study, we identified increased mx expression in kidney tissues only once peak viral loads were reached, which in conjunction with the work of dahle et al.  <cit> , suggests that an antiviral response against prv is initiated late during the mature phase of prv infection and can occur in both the presence and absence of inflammatory associated disease. however, without disease manifestations, we observed that mx transcription was not maintained and returned to a comparable control level by 9 weeks post challenge . in another study, johansen et al.  <cit>  examined the transcriptional response of atlantic salmon cardiac tissues during a mature phase of prv infection over a period of  <dig> to  <dig> wpc which used an injection challenge of prv inoculum made from hearts of atlantic salmon experiencing hsmi. this work appeared to encompass a period after peak prv infections were reached, as decreasing quantities of prv transcripts were identified in heart tissues from the first sampling at  <dig> wpc through to the end of the experiment at  <dig> wpc when only one out of five fish tested positive for prv. histopathological signs of hsmi were first evident at  <dig> wpc , became prevalent at  <dig> wpc , then declined at the end of the 11 week trial . however, even though prv loads were in decline and many heart tissues appeared to be in the process of clearing prv infection, expression of viral responsive degs was reported to be consistently elevated in challenged heart tissues relative to time- <dig> controls throughout this period. although different tissues make direct comparisons difficult, these results provide counterpoint to the brief antiviral responsiveness of sockeye kidney to prv in the absence of disease, and suggest that hsmi may perpetuate antiviral signalling as a direct result of pathology in infected tissues.

currently, the only study that has observed significant host transcriptional responsiveness to prv during early prv amplification was recently reported by johansen et al.  <cit>  who challenged atlantic salmon parr and smolts with prv through cohabitation in freshwater and seawater, respectively, using prv source material from an outbreak of hsmi. the challenge resulted in heart lesions typical of hsmi in both life history stages at 8 weeks post cohabitation and many antiviral responsive genes were shown to be unregulated in kidney and spleen by microarray analysis during early prv infection  for which some genes were confirmed to be significantly elevated by qpcr. however, both microarray and qpcr analysis identified significant induction of antiviral genes at  <dig> wpc even though prv transcripts were not detected by qpcr until  <dig> wpc, which makes the relationship of their expression in reference to prv very difficult to interpret.

why sockeye salmon infected with prv have such a limited transcriptional response in the presence of increasing viral loads is unclear; however, many reoviruses are known to use blood as a means for disseminating from a port of entry to target tissues and leukocytes, erythrocytes and platelets have all been shown to be susceptible to at least one form of reoviral infection in a wide range of host organisms . nevertheless, the presence of reovirus in blood is not usually associated with anemia or leukopenia, and to our knowledge reoviruses have not been shown to induce antiviral responses in vivo directly from blood cells due to infection. in our current study we did not observe anemia due to the presence of prv  which has also been noted previously in other non-pathogenic prv infections of atlantic and pacific salmon  <cit>  as well as during infections associated with hsmi  <cit> . in contrast, dissemination of many pathogenic orthoreoviruses into target tissues quickly leads to host immune responses and pathology. for example, induction of host immune responses leading to cellular apoptosis is considered the major cause for mammalian reovirus  encephalitis and myocarditis, which appears to be initiated shortly after viral cell entry and before the core particles become transcriptionally active in these target cells  <cit> . thus, the general lack of cellular responses and apoptosis signalling in blood compared to tissues following mammalian reoviral infection is suggestive of a fundamental difference in the way blood cells and target tissue cells interact with this virus. we hypothesize that prv also interacts differently with blood cells compared to tissue cells, and that prv can evade antiviral responses during erythrocyte entry and replication in vivo. following primary replication in erythrocytes, we suspect the dissemination of virus into resident tissue cells causes host antiviral responses for which epd may be involved. still, erythrocytes have been shown to mount antiviral responses against prv ex vivo  <cit>  and further work will be required to identify a mechanism to explain the variability for prv to induce host cell responses during natural infection.

differences in cell and/or tissue type interaction with prv also does not explain the presence or absence of hsmi following prv infection, as prv loads have been observed to reach comparable levels with or without pathology in both heart and skeletal muscle  <cit> . one potential explanation for this disparity may involve genetic variation between prv isolates. siah et al.  <cit>  recently conducted a phylogenetic analysis of all segments of the prv obtained from western north america as well as selected norwegian and chilean prv genomes. with the exception of segment s <dig>  samples of north american prv clustered separately from the norwegian and chilean samples indicating that there are genetic differences across the genome between pacific, norwegian and chilean forms of prv. in the case of mammalian reoviruses, small changes in the genome can be reflected in dramatic changes in infectivity and virulence  <cit> . for example, doyle et al.  <cit>  identified that a single amino change in the ơ <dig> protein, which affects outer capsid stability, was sufficient to increase replication, host to host spread, and virulence in mice. based on the analysis of samples of prv from norway, wessel et al.  <cit>  determined that the ơ <dig> protein had a dsrna binding function similar to that reported for the ơ <dig> protein of mammalian orthoreovirus. the dsrna-binding activity of the mrv ơ <dig> protein inhibits the induction of type- <dig> ifn and activation of protein kinase r  which through its interaction with translation initiation factor  inhibits cellular mrna translation, thereby, limiting viral protein production. siah et al.  <cit>  compared the predicted structure of the north american prv ơ <dig> protein to predicted ơ <dig> proteins based on norwegian/chilean sequences. these authors identified an amino acid difference which results in a predicted change in secondary structure from an “alpha-helix” in norwegian/chilean prv source to a “sheet structure” in north american prv sequences. these authors also identified an amino acid substitution in the μ <dig> protein between north american and norwegian/chilean prv which results in a predicted change in protein structure. whether these predicted changes in secondary structure results in changes of function for these proteins and or virulence differences between these prv sources is unknown.

epigenetic host factors may also provide a possible explanation for regional or stock inconsistency regarding prv associated disease. in this study, the majority of unigenes that were expressed in response to prv infection were non-coding. additional investigation and validation for the putative prv responsive long non-coding rnas  identified in this study may therefore prove valuable, as lncrnas have been shown to play critical roles in epigenetic transcription silencing  <cit>  and can have post-translational abilities to alter protein function in mammals  <cit> . a number of lncrnas have also been speculated to be important during infectious salmon anemia virus  infection of atlantic salmon  <cit> , although the functions for either prv-responsive host lncrnas identified in this study or isav-responsive lncrnas identified previously are so far unknown.

another potential factor for altering virulence during prv infection could be the involvement of a coinfecting pathogen. a number of significant human diseases are known to be caused or exacerbated as a result of coinfections involving viral pathogens , and infection by avian reovirus in chickens has been shown to substantially increase anemia caused by chicken anemia virus during dual infection  <cit> . alternatively, a coinfecting agent may provide protection against other viral infection; such as in the increased survival afforded to chum salmon reovirus  or infectious pancreatic necrosis virus  infected rainbow trout during lethal ihnv superinfection  <cit> . in this study, prv did not protect sockeye against superinfection ihnv. this is not entirely surprising, as the induction of interferon antiviral responses is usually the mechanism for protection during viral coinfections and is likely responsible for the previous reports of ihnv protection in rainbow trout afforded by csv or ipnv mentioned above  <cit> . as prv had little to no effect on systemic or kidney specific cellular signalling for the first 3 weeks following exposure which included the first week  of ihnv superinfection, a similar mechanism for protection seems unlikely to be generated from prv during this period. nevertheless, we hypothesize timing may be critical with regard to this type of putative protection, and suspect that exposure to ihnv following peak prv dissemination which causes host antiviral activation  may indeed contribute to a reduced virulence of ihnv if exposure occurred during this time. further work in identifying such protection may warrant additional investigation; however any putative protection would likely be short lived, as antiviral responses generated against prv in this study abated by  <dig> wpc in the absence of prv associated disease.

conversely, one of the more surprising observations of this study was the lack of protection afforded by host antiviral responses against ihnv to inhibit prv transcription and dissemination. prv transcriptional loads continued to increase at comparable rates in both blood and kidney with or without the considerable transcriptomic changes induced by ihnv. in a previous norwegian study, chronic ipnv infections also did not significantly alter prv transcription, nor was vaccination with bacterial and ipnv antigen 8 weeks before prv exposure able to reduce prv loads at  <dig> wpc  <cit> . collectively, these data suggest that although prv does not appear to induce a significant antiviral state during early dissemination, the activation of host antiviral responses during this time appears inconsequential to prv transcription in either the blood or kidney.

CONCLUSIONS
here we demonstrate that prv causes minimal changes to the sockeye salmon head kidney transcriptome during the first 3 weeks of infection following injection. viral loads increased substantially during this period in both blood and kidney tissues which indicate that prv has the ability to evade or block host recognition during hematogenous dissemination and early replication within the sockeye salmon. in this instance, evasion rather than active blocking of host responses is more likely, as prv had no measured impact on the substantial host transcriptional responses generated against superinfection with ihnv during this period.

robust host transcriptome responses that included activation of classic antiviral pathways generated during ihnv superinfection did not affect increases in prv transcriptional load. the mechanisms for why antiviral responses fail to impact prv transcription, induce erythrocyte/renal cell apoptosis, or lead to pathology in sockeye salmon are still unclear; however we suspect variations in the way prv interacts with different cell types may be important. here we identified a late increase in mx expression at  <dig> wpc during a period of peak viral loads in kidney tissue which was preceded by an increased expression of epd at  <dig> wpc in prv infected kidneys but not blood. although the role of epd in prv infection is currently unknown, its previous association with stress/immune functions in other fish species and its lone transcriptional regulation during early prv infection in sockeye suggests an important putative role in host prv responsiveness and warrants further investigation.

the reason for the very limited transcriptional response in sockeye salmon to prv within the first 3– <dig> weeks of infection remains unclear. although we hypothesize that disparities in the way prv interacts with different cell types may explain some aspects regarding host responsiveness to prv, there are many factors involved in prv pathogenesis which make comparisons of current studies difficult. for example, some transcriptional differences observed in response to prv can likely be attributed to differences in host species . this study also focused on the head kidney which may have a different transcriptional profile when compared to heart tissues. it is also possible that genotypic differences exist between north american prv and the types of prv that are associated with strong transcriptional responses and the presentation of the hsmi disease state in norway. lastly, the experiment that we are reporting was conducted in a controlled environment with optimal water conditions. under these conditions, it appears that prv is of low virulence to sockeye salmon and that carriers of prv are not at a disadvantage when it comes to superinfection with ihnv. whether these results will hold under less optimal more stressful conditions such as those experienced in the field warrant further consideration.
