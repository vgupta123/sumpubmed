BACKGROUND
dna damage checkpoints are signal transduction pathways that maintain the proper order of cell cycle events. when dna is damaged or perturbed during replication, the cells respond by the activation of evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathways that delay the progression of the cell cycle and induce repair of the damaged dna. these signal transduction pathways include protein sensors that recognize aberrant dna structures and activate kinases, thereby inducing phosphorylation cascades that ultimately lead to cell cycle arrest and dna repair  <cit> . failure of this cell cycle surveillance mechanism can cause genomic instability which eventually leads to the formation of cancer in mammals  <cit> .

hrad <dig> protein is the human homologue of schizosaccharomyces pombe rad <dig>  a member of the checkpoint rad genes  which are required for the s phase  and g <dig>  check points  <cit> . like its yeast counterpart, hrad <dig> forms a ring-shaped, heterotrimeric complex with the hrad <dig> and hhus <dig> proteins  <cit> . each member of hrad9-hrad1-hhus <dig> complex , shares sequence homology with proliferating cell nuclear antigen , a homotrimer that encircles the dna and tethers dna polymerase δ during dna synthesis  <cit> . pcna is loaded onto dna by the pentameric protein complex replication factor c   <cit> , which is composed of one large subunit and four smaller subunits. in a manner analogous to pcna and rfc, 9-1- <dig> complex is loaded onto dna by a complex between hrad <dig> and the four small subunits of rfc  <cit> . since dna damage induces hrad17-dependent association of 9-1- <dig> complex with chromatin, the 9-1- <dig> complex is believed to be involved in the direct recognition of dna lesions during the initial stages of the checkpoint response; the 9-1- <dig> complex may thus be associated with chromatin following dna damage to transduce signals for dna damage-activated checkpoint signaling pathways  <cit> . in mammalian cells, the signal initiated by the sensors, two phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases , ataxia-telangiectasia mutated  and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and rad3-related , plays a central role in the checkpoint signaling pathways  <cit> . atm and atr are activated by downstream signaling proteins, genotoxins and phosphorylation including chk <dig> and chk <dig>  two protein kinases that regulate checkpoint responses  <cit> . hrad <dig> is highly modified by phosphorylation in at specific points of the cell cycle after dna damage, and it also plays a critical role in checkpoint signaling  <cit> . atm-mediated phosphorylation at ser- <dig> of hrad <dig> is required for ir-induced g1/s checkpoint activation  <cit> ; other phosphorylation sites in the c-terminal region are also essential for chk <dig> activation following hydroxyurea , ir, and uv treatment  <cit> , although the exact function of hrad <dig> in cell cycle control has not yet been completely characterized.

the tumor suppressor gene tp <dig> controls cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, and genomic stability  <cit> . a defect in the pathway, involving p <dig>  is essential for the malignant progression of cancer  <cit> . when cells with wild-type tp <dig> are exposed to dna-damaging agents, p <dig> is functionally activated, p <dig> protein level rises, and p <dig> binds to and transcriptionally activates the promoters of target genes  <cit> . these target genes include; p <dig>  mdm <dig>  gadd <dig>  bax, igf-bp <dig> and cyclin g. the p <dig> gene product was originally identified, as a potential target for the p <dig> tumor suppressive activity   <cit> . it is either an inhibitor of the g <dig> cyclin-dependent kinases   <cit> , or an inhibitor of dna synthesis that is expressed during cellular senescence   <cit> . it is known that p <dig> is a major effector of the g <dig> cell cycle checkpoint. therefore, p <dig> is a negative regulator of the cell cycle progression and it controls the transition from g <dig> to s phase of the cell cycle  <cit> . this report demonstrates that hrad <dig> plays a role in the modulation of p <dig> transcription by direct interaction with p <dig>  furthermore, the substitution of the phosphorylation sites on hrad <dig> to ala resulted in an alteration of the regulation of p <dig>  the present study supports the hypothesis that hrad <dig> plays a role in the modulation of p <dig> transcription, presumably via competition with p <dig>  that involves its c-terminus, which would be essential for the cellular response to dna damage.

RESULTS
p <dig> is activated immediately after uv treatment
several previous studies have shown that genotoxic stress induces the stabilization and transient accumulation of wild-type p <dig> protein in mammalian cells, leading to an increase of expression of p <dig> down-stream genes, including p <dig>  <cit> . employing rt-pcr, the level of p <dig> mrna expression of human embryonic kidney  <dig> cells was examined in these experiments. the level of p <dig> mrna expression substantially increased at  <dig> min after uv irradiation and reached maximal levels at  <dig> hr thereafter. at that time, the mrna levels were reduced but still detectable until  <dig> hr after uv exposure . next, using the protein equivalent to each time points, a western blotting analysis was performed to examine the time course of p <dig> protein expression. as shown in figure 1b, a substantial increase of p <dig> was seen at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hr following exposure to uv. these results indicate that the accumulation of both p <dig> transcript and p <dig> protein occurred, and g1/s checkpoint was activated after uv irradiation. since  <dig> cells are immortalized by e1b, derived from human adenoviral proteins, and might be defective in p <dig> signaling, another mrc <dig> fibroblast cell line with wild-type p <dig> was examined, and observed that p <dig> mrna increased about  <dig>  fold after uv irradiation , thus suggesting that exposure to uv leads an increase of p <dig> expression of both cell lines similarly under these conditions. this expression pattern of p <dig> mrna and p <dig> protein suggests that the g1/s checkpoint is activated immediately after dna damage, and inhibits damaged cells from progressing through the cell cycle and entering the s phase  <cit> . after the peak of activation, p <dig> transcription declined as observed in a recent report that indicated that p <dig> can be degraded during excision repair  <cit> . this suggests that more than the arrest of the cell cycle at g <dig> or a broad time period could thus be involved in the decrease of p <dig> mrna and protein following uv exposure.

the role of hrad <dig> in p53-dependent p <dig> activation through its c-terminus
utilizing the p <dig> promoter-luciferase reporter system, the functional aspect of regulation of p <dig> by hrad <dig> was assessed. since phosphorylation of hrad <dig> is required for dna damage checkpoint activation  <cit> , the requirement of phosphorylation of hrad <dig> for p <dig> transcription was investigated using wild-type and the following phosphorylation-defective rad <dig> mutants: 1) rad9-s272a, with a substitution of ser- <dig> with an ala residue, 2) rad9-9a, with substitutions of c-terminus phosphorylation sites including ser- <dig>  ser- <dig>  ser- <dig>  ser- <dig>  ser- <dig>  ser- <dig>  ser- <dig>  ser- <dig>  and ser- <dig>  with ala, and 3) rad9-8a, with substitutions of all c-terminus phosphorylation sites except for ser- <dig>  with ala. western blotting was performed to confirm the expression of the protein in wild-type and mutants,. wild-type rad <dig> was detectably expressed as a series of large proteins, suggesting the phosphorylated form of hrad <dig>   <cit> . rad9-s272a also expressed with a similar series of large proteins, presumably corresponding to different phosphorylated species of hrad <dig>  with a gradient of phosphorylation excluding the ser <dig> residue.   <cit> . the transfection of rad9-8a or rad9-9a resulted in a reduced phosphorylation compared to wild-type rad <dig> . the results indicate that phosphorylation-defective mutants are substantially expressed and retain the capacity for reduced phosphorylation  <cit> . afterward, the promoter region of p <dig> was fused to a luciferase reporter  and it was cotransfected along with plasmids into cells as indicated. background levels of expression were low, as demonstrated by a control transfection of empty vector and promoter-less pgl3-basic . by using the reporter vector, containing the p53-binding consensus sequence  <cit> , the introduction of p <dig> expectedly induced luciferase activity . the introduction of the wild-type rad <dig> also induced the positive luciferase activity , although not as intensively as p <dig>  the co-expression of p <dig> and wild-type rad <dig> induced luciferase activity  at an intermediate level in comparison to that seen when each protein is transfected independently. considering these data, in association with the previous report of the potential transactivating property of hrad <dig> for the p <dig> promoter  <cit> , these results support the concept that hrad <dig> can stimulate the transcription of p <dig> and it may modulate the p <dig> function. the luciferase activity was comparable among wild-type and phosphorylation-defective mutants following the plasmid introduction , and was lower in the co-expression of mutants , suggesting that the phosphorylation of hrad <dig> is involved in regulation of p53-dependent p <dig> transcription. yin et al.  <cit>  reported that wild-type hrad <dig> activates p <dig> transcription and that the co-expression of p <dig> and wild-type hrad <dig> results in the intermediate transcriptional activity by p <dig> or hrad <dig> alone, consistent with the present results. this suggests that phosphorylation may thus play a possible role in p <dig> dependent p <dig> transcription.

knock down of endogenous hrad <dig> increases the transcription of p21
endogenous hrad <dig> was knocked down using sirna to address the role of hrad <dig> for the transcription of p <dig> in response to uv exposure. a western blot analysis showed that sirna treatment resulted in the reduction of endogenous p <dig> or hrad <dig> . in addition, hrad <dig> sirna did not increase p <dig> protein compared to mock treatment . using rt-pcr, the p <dig> mrna level was determined. the knockdown of hrad <dig> resulted in an increase in the level of p <dig> mrna , whereas the knockdown of tp <dig> showed levels of p <dig> mrna comparable to mock-treatment . this suggests that hrad <dig> plays a role in modulating p <dig> transactivation. after uv treatment, the mock-treated cells showed an increase of p <dig> mrna , compared with uv  control, under these conditions. tp <dig> sirna transfection resulted in an obvious reduction of p <dig> mrna , thus suggesting that the effect of p <dig> reduction was appreciable after uv-induced damage under those conditions. in contrast, hrad <dig> knockdown resulted in an apparent increase of p <dig> mrna after uv exposure . the uv treatment was not simply additive to the hrad <dig> knockdown in p <dig> transactivation, thus suggesting that the reduction of endogenous hrad <dig> resulted in a profound effect in uv damage-dependent and -independent p <dig> pathway. furthermore, semi-quantitative rt-pcr and pcr-southern blotting was performed to confirm the effect of rad <dig> sirna, and similar results were obtained . using tp53-deficient mefs, real time rt-pcr was used to confirm the effect of knockdown of rad <dig> in p <dig> transcription, and this demonstrated an increase in p <dig> mrna after knockdown of rad <dig> , thus supporting the concept that rad <dig> is not only an activator, but also a modulator in this pathway. the transactivation of p <dig> in the absence and reduction of the p <dig> and rad <dig> may be due to transcription factors, such as sp <dig>  <cit> . in addition, a p53-deficient cell line te- <dig>  with transcriptionally inactive tp <dig>  <cit> , was used to study the effect of the introduced hrad <dig> and p <dig> proteins under p <dig> negative background. te- <dig> cells were transfected with wild-type or phosphorylation-defective mutant rad <dig>  and tp <dig> plasmids, and the expression of each protein was confirmed by western blotting; the exogenous expression of wild-type and mutant rad <dig> elicited the induction of p <dig> mrna and its product, associated with ser <dig> phosphorylation of transfected p <dig>  whereas endogenous p <dig> and its phosphorylated form were undetectable without transgene introduction , thus suggesting that rad <dig> may play a role in the p53-dependent p <dig> transactivation and rad9-p <dig> might express a certain active function in p <dig> negative cancer cells, compatible with the previous report  <cit> . one might speculate that rad9-p <dig> has a high affinity for the p <dig> promoter; rather than the induction of p <dig>  the transfection could result in the reduction of p <dig> in endogenous p53-positive cells, and might stimulate p <dig> in p53-negative background. it also should be noted that numerous or uncharacterized, additional alterations might accumulate in cancer-derived cell lines. taken together, the present data indicate that the transfection of hrad <dig> plays a role in p <dig> transcription, depending on the co-expressed p <dig> , and the knockdown of hrad <dig> can stimulate p <dig> transactivation, thus suggesting that the protein level of hrad <dig> may be involved in modulation and regulation of p <dig> transactivation. considering that other studies show that hrad <dig> accumulation after dna damage  <cit>  may enhance the modulation of p <dig> promoter activation, this supports the hypothesis that hrad <dig> may regulate p <dig> transcription in concert with p <dig>  and that the reduction of hrad <dig> might elicit the checkpoint response. recent studies with tumors indicate that the hrad <dig> gene is located in a chromosomal region at 11q <dig>  this genomic region is amplified and both mrna and protein are frequently overexpressed in breast, lung, head and neck cancer  <cit> . this up-regulation is correlated with tumor size and local recurrence  <cit> . furthermore, silencing hrad <dig> by rna interference inhibits cell proliferation in vitro  <cit> . these observations are consistent with the findings of the present study. nevertheless, there is still insufficient data to determine whether hrad <dig> might be involved directly or indirectly in p53-dependent p <dig> activation. therefore, the assessment of the direct association of hrad9-p <dig> is the next step.

hrad <dig> associates with p53
the data reported above indicate that transfection of hrad <dig> modulates p53-dependent p <dig> promoter activation, and that knockdown of hrad <dig> stimulates p53-dependent p <dig> promoter activation. therefore, the association of endogenous hrad <dig> with endogenous p <dig> was examined using immunoprecipitation. endogenous hrad <dig> was co-immunoprecipitated with p <dig> from  <dig> cells . the hrad9-p <dig> association was then assessed in another mrc <dig> cells using immunoprecipitation and similar results were obtained , thus suggesting that the association is not specific to the cell type. considering these results, along with those of the pull-down assay of gst-fusion p <dig> with  methionine-labeled in vitro-translated hrad <dig> protein , the findings of the present study strongly suggests that hrad <dig> acts as a modulator of p <dig> transcription through a direct association with p <dig>  to investigate whether phosphorylation of hrad <dig> affects the binding to p <dig>  wild-type or phosphorylation-defective rad <dig> mutants were transfected, and immunoprecipitation was performed. the results showed p <dig> to be associated with hrad <dig>  in both the wild-type and phosphorylation-defective mutants . however the association with rad9-8a or rad9-9a was somewhat reduced . the data implicate the substantial association of p <dig> with intact hrad <dig>  and that the hrad <dig> mutants might be altered in capacity for p <dig> binding, presumably due to conformational changes and affinity of complex, which would result the release of immunoprecipitated components after extensive washes.

previous studies have showed that p <dig> protein can be phosphorylated at ser- <dig> within  <dig> hr after dna damage  <cit> . a western blot analysis indicated that ser- <dig> of p <dig> was phosphorylated  <dig> min after uv treatment in the present experiments . the time course of this reaction was examined to determine whether the association of hrad <dig> and p <dig> might be altered after uv irradiation. figure 4d demonstrates that the phosphorylation of p <dig> at ser- <dig> in the immunoprecipitated components increased at  <dig> min and reached a maximal level at  <dig> hr after uv treatment, and declined, consistent with the western blot findings in figure 4c, whereas the total amount of rad9-p <dig> interaction did not increase. in addition, other phosphorylation sites of p <dig>  including ser- <dig>  ser- <dig>  ser- <dig>  ser- <dig>  ser- <dig>  and ser- <dig> were also examined and they were phosphorylated temporally, regardless of the positive association of hrad <dig> with p <dig> over the time course, as observed ser- <dig> . these results indicate that the binding of hrad <dig> and p <dig> is not significantly affected by phosphorylation, though it is possible that the modifications of the phosphorylation in these amino acid residues are not involved in the binding of the components.

the present immunoprecipitation study revealed hrad <dig> to be associated with p <dig>  and the association was detected regardless of degree of phosphorylation of p <dig> and presumably of hrad <dig>  a previous report also demonstrated that constitutive phosphorylation of hrad <dig> does not influence the stability of the 9-1- <dig> complex  <cit> . it is suggested that hrad <dig>  as a complex with p <dig>  may be involved in the transactivation of p <dig> and that the phosphorylations of hrad <dig> and p <dig> might modulate the transactivation activity of the complex. whereas none of the phosphorylation sites of hrad <dig> targeted in the present study have been previously reported to be required for genotoxin-induced chromatin binding  <cit> , the present data suggest that hrad <dig> phosphorylation might be involved in binding affinity for p53-consensus binding sites.

phosphorylation of hrad <dig> affects the preference of p <dig> for binding sites
the effects of alterations of the affinity of hrad9/p <dig> for p53-consensus binding sites of p <dig> promoter for chromatin remodeling after uv treatment were investigated. previous studies show that hrad <dig> specifically binds to a p53-consensus dna-binding sequence in the p <dig> promoter and regulates p <dig> at the transcriptional level  <cit> . a chip assay was used to evaluate whether the affinity of hrad9/p <dig> complex for p <dig> binding sites may increase after uv treatment, and whether the phosphorylation of hrad <dig> affects the affinity for binding sites. the human p <dig> promoter contains two p53-binding sites , and the treatment with 5-fluorouracil significantly enhances the recruitment of p <dig> protein to both upstream and downstream p <dig> promoter regions  <cit> . therefore, each of the two p53-binding sites was observed. a chip assay with anti-p <dig> and anti-rad <dig> antibodies showed that their binding to each of upstream and downstream p <dig> promoters was increased  <dig> to  <dig> min after uv treatment, whereas chip with anti-acethylated histone h <dig> antibody indicated that the acetylation around the p <dig> promoter was not altered significantly in the those conditions , thus suggesting that the association of p <dig> and hrad <dig>  and its subsequent complex with p <dig> promoters is correlated with the regulation of transcription after uv exposure. next, chip assays were performed with transfectants of the wild-type or phosphorylation-defective rad <dig> plasmids. as shown in figure 5c, hrad <dig> and p <dig> binding to the downstream site was inhibited by introduction of phosphorylation-defective mutants . the association was increased after uv treatment, in all cases except for cells transfected with the rad9-8a plasmid which showed a low affinity to the binding site. this suggests the possibility that systematic, scheduled or sequential phosphorylation of ser residues in hrad <dig> might be necessary for efficient binding to p53-consensus dna sequences. chip binding of hrad <dig> seems to be reduced slightly, compared to that of p <dig>  which might be due to the specificity of the antibodies. similar results with hrad <dig> and p <dig> were obtained at the upstream binding site . the present results suggest that the phosphorylation of the c-terminal region of hrad <dig> may play a role in modulation of the affinity for binding its consensus sites.

recent studies have demonstrated the multifunctional roles of hrad <dig> a dna damage sensor in the 9-1- <dig> complex, a g2/m checkpoint via the phosphorylation of chk <dig>  in dna repair via dna polymerase β  <cit>  or flap endonuclease  <dig>  <cit> , and in apoptosis via potential binding to bcl- <dig> or bcl-xl  <cit> . the present study, demonstrated the direct association of rad9-p <dig> and the regulatory role of phosphorylation in the activation of p <dig> transcription, thus indicating that hrad <dig> is an important modulator, but not a unique player with a single function.

CONCLUSIONS
hrad <dig> has a complex role in response to dna damage, acting not only as an activator but also as a modulator in p <dig> transcription and contributing to the regulation of genomic integrity. if hrad <dig> was regulated inaccurately, the p <dig> could not regulate the appropriate g1/s transition and replication, thus resulting in the occurrence of unscheduled replications after dna damage. such events can contribute to the accumulation of pathological conditions and genomic instability in carcinogenesis and tumor progression.
