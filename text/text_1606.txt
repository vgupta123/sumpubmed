BACKGROUND
we recently reported bovine secreted protein of ly- <dig>  domain  <dig>  sold <dig>  as a lining protein that might participate in the formation of cotyledonary villi  <cit> . ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goats, have a cotyledonary placenta. here we aimed to explore the expression of sold <dig> in sheep and goat placentas and to clarify its roles in the ruminant placenta. we examined gene regulation of chorionic fibroblasts cultured with sold <dig> in vitro. we also compared sold <dig> protein characterization and roles among sheep, goats and cattle.

the ly- <dig> domain is a 70- <dig> amino acid  long protein characterized by a conserved pattern of 8- <dig> cysteine residues with a defined pattern of disulfide bonding  <cit> . the ly- <dig> superfamily comprises membrane type glycosylphosphatidylinositol -anchored proteins and secreted proteins  <cit> . the secreted members lack a gpi-anchor, such as the secreted ly6/plaur domain containing  <dig>   <cit> , ly6/neurotoxin  <dig>   <cit> , acrosomal vesicle protein  <dig>   <cit> , protein expressed in prostate and testis   <cit>  and secreted seminal vesicle ly <dig> protein   <cit> . genes for these proteins are found mainly in male reproductive tissues, such as the prostate, testis and spermatozoa. in contrast, bovine sold <dig> is exclusively found in female reproductive tissues and was confirmed in the placenta and the intercotyledonary membranes  <cit> . no expression of sold <dig> orthologs has been reported in human or mouse placentas. there appears to be a ly- <dig> domain protein that is essential for placental formation in the ruminant.

RESULTS
characterization of mrna and deduced protein sequences of ovine and caprine sold1
we cloned cdna sequences for ovine  and caprine  sold <dig> from placentomes and identified two 303-bp open reading frame cdna sequences as ovsold <dig> and casold <dig>  respectively. the sequence deduced from sold <dig> cdnas had  <dig> aa. the n-terminal 22-aa-long regions of both sold <dig> proteins were rich in hydrophobic aa residues characteristic of a signal peptide . the sold <dig> mrna and deduced mature regions of aa sequences in the three ruminants  were highly homologous at 81-95% . the sequences had  <dig> cysteines  and this configuration was identified in all three proteins . there was a range of 31-71% homology among sold1s with rat urinary proteins , rat spleen protein- <dig> , porcine protein- <dig> , mouse sslp- <dig> and the c-terminal regions of acrv <dig> from some species, using domain alignment on data from the dna data bank of japan  web site http://clustalw.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html . although low homologies in the aa sequences were demonstrated between the ly- <dig> domains, the characteristic cys configuration was intact among all ly- <dig> domains in these proteins . the numbers of potential n-glycosylation sites  of each ruminant sold <dig> differed . thus, ovsold <dig> had two consensus sequences at positions 32- <dig> and 81- <dig>  by contrast, casold <dig> had only one consensus sequence at position 32- <dig> and bovine  sold <dig> had three consensus sequences at positions 32- <dig>  60- <dig> and 81- <dig>  phylogenetic analysis showed that the ovine, caprine and bovine sold <dig> proteins and porcine pip- <dig> were phylogenetic neighbors . we have submitted these sequences to the ddbj and the ddbj/genbank accession nos. are ab <dig>  and ab <dig> .

sold <dig> gene expression
we determined sold <dig> mrna localization by in situ hybridization in ovine and caprine placentomes at days  <dig> and  <dig> of gestation in sheep and goats, respectively . digoxigenin -labeled ovsold <dig> and casold <dig> anti-sense rna specifically detected the mrna in each species in trophoblast mononucleate cells  in cotyledons and in intercotyledonary membranes. there was no expression in giant binucleate cells . no sold <dig> mrna was found in the maternal tissues . we detected no significant signal with the all sense probes.

we confirmed that the anti-bosold <dig> antibody was bound to purified recombinant ovsold <dig> and casold <dig> using western blotting . the results of immunohistochemistry on ovine and caprine placentomes using the anti-bosold <dig> antibody are shown in figure  <dig>  intense staining for sold <dig> was observed in the mesenchymal areas of stem  and branch  villi. tmcs, --the mrna-producing cells--were poorly stained. no specific staining was detected in caruncular or intercaruncular endometrium. the staining characteristics were similar in both species .

gene regulation of bovine chorionic fibroblasts  by sold1
we investigated differences in the expression patterns of the genes for nucleoredoxin  and bcl2-like  <dig> , in bcfs following treatment with ovsold <dig>  casold <dig> and bosold <dig> . nxn expression was upregulated by sold <dig> treatment . bcl2l <dig> expression was downregulated by sold <dig> treatment . ovsold <dig> and bosold <dig> significantly regulated the expression levels of these genes. however, no significant differences were detected in bcl2l <dig> expression levels in case of the casold <dig> treatment.

discussion
the sold <dig> genes are highly homologous among sheep, goats and cattle, showing the general similarity of the ly- <dig> domain superfamily . although the overall cross-species homology was not high for multiply aligned polypeptides, the characteristic cys configuration was seen consistently. these genes also encode for some potential n-glycosylation sites. we therefore predict that these molecules have evolved from a common phylogenetic origin. currently, it is hard to tell whether these genes and their products have any common functions, because ly- <dig> superfamily genes have been detected in various tissues. acrv <dig>  which resembles sold <dig> structurally, is a spermatid-specific gene in several species  <cit> . mouse sslp- <dig> is also a spermatid-specific gene  <cit> ; rat rup- <dig>  rup- <dig> and rup- <dig> are expressed in urinary organs and rat rsp- <dig> is expressed in the spleen  <cit> . sold <dig> was mainly expressed in placental tissues in these ruminants . expression of pate-p and -q have been reported in human placental tissue  <cit> . however, the aa sequences of these proteins do not show high homology with sold <dig>  <cit> .

although both ovsold <dig> and casold <dig> mrna were expressed in tmcs , their encoded proteins were detected in mesenchymal villi . these expression features of the genes and proteins are identical to that found in the bovine  <cit> . we predict that the sold <dig> protein must have specific functions for ruminants, because no homologous protein has been found in the human or mouse to date. the cotyledonary mesenchyme is mainly composed of extracellular matrix, mesodermal fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells. we have reported that bosold <dig> is secreted to the basolateral surface in trophoblast and is mainly bound to a tetrapeptide of type i collagen  <cit> . it has been suggested that sold <dig> is an essential protein for cotyledonary formation. however, the physiological role of sold <dig> is still unknown. here, we investigated the effect of sold <dig> on gene expression in bcfs. nxn is a thioredoxin  family protein and mainly suppresses the wnt-beta-catenin pathway  <cit> . its effect is to suppress cell proliferation. bcl2l <dig> is a pro-apoptotic bcl <dig> family member  <cit>  and its expression promotes apoptosis. we found here that nxn expression was upregulated in bcfs by exposure to ovsold <dig>  casold <dig> or bosold <dig> and this is likely to suppress their proliferation. in contrast, bcl2l <dig> was downregulated in bcfs by exposure to ovsold <dig> or bosold <dig> and this is likely to suppress apoptosis. we suggest that sold <dig> acts as a modulator of proliferation and apoptosis in chorionic fibroblasts. we also expect that sold <dig> will show a similar role among the ruminants. it is known that lypd <dig>  slurp <dig>  lynx <dig> and the pate family are ligands of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor  in the secreted ly- <dig> family of several tissues  <cit> . this receptor regulates sodium and calcium ion channels. if sold <dig> acts as a ligand of nachr it is likely that the expression levels of nxn and bcl2l <dig> are regulated via such ion channel pathways.

the trophoblast cells of the ruminant placenta are divided into bncs and tmcs  <cit> . bncs account for approximately 20% of the total trophoblast cell population  <cit> . they are directly involved in modification of the uterine epithelium beginning at implantation and continuing until term. bnc products, such as placental lactogen, pregnancy-associated glycoproteins and steroid hormones, are not restricted in terms of their direction of secretion  <cit> . hence, the bncs play a pivotal role in fetal-maternal communication in ruminants. tmcs are a source of interferon-tau , which participates in the recognition of gestation during the peri-implantation period in ruminants. thus the production of ifnt is a specific role of tmcs. however, other roles of placental tmcs are obscure. one function might be the production of sold <dig> proteins to develop villi. the matrix metalloproteinases, mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  are also produced by ruminant tmcs  <cit> . in the human syncytiotrophoblast, mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> are secreted to the basolateral surface of the cells and modify the basement membrane  <cit> . this is similar to the secretion property of sold <dig>  <cit> . tmcs have polarity and this might be related to the production of a protein involved in determining the direction of secretion.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have identified two sheep and goat secreted proteins, ovsold <dig> and casold <dig>  each composed only of the ly- <dig> domain and a signal peptide. both types of sold <dig> mrna appeared in tmcs throughout gestation and their proteins were localized in the mesenchyme of primary and secondary placental villi. phylogenetic configuration, expression and protein localization were similar among the ruminant sold <dig> proteins and bovine sold <dig> orthologs are found in the sheep and goat. as for the physiological role of sold <dig>  which is unknown for cattle, we examined the effects of sold <dig> on bcfs. sold <dig> might be one of the main factors for modulating and establishing the villous mesenchyme in ruminants through the regulation of nxn and bcl2l <dig> expression in chorionic fibroblasts.
