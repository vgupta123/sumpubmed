BACKGROUND
gene expression studies in tumour tissue in comparison with its corresponding normal tissue counterpart open up prospects for identifying new biomarkers and targets characteristic of the respective tumour entity. for that purpose, the relative quantification of reverse transcription-pcr  data is the method of choice to ascertain gene expression results  <cit> . this method is based on the normalization of the target gene expression on any stably expressed internal reference gene, a so-called "housekeeping" gene, measured in the same biological material. a crucial problem involved here is finding such a suitable reference gene which has to be tested and verified under defined study conditions. the general conditions a reference gene must meet is that its expression in the samples studied be stable, non-regulated and constant and not be influenced by biological  or experimental  conditions or treatments  <cit> . in addition, the reference gene and the target gene should have similar ranges of expression to avoid analytical problems.

in literature, several single housekeeping genes or housekeeping gene indexes summarizing two or more housekeeping genes have been used for relative quantification  <cit> . however, these genes were often adopted without exact knowledge of their individual expression behaviour under the special study conditions. recently, we discussed that issue in two studies concerning the identification of candidate reference genes for the relative quantification of expression data in the urological tumours of the prostate and bladder  <cit> .

renal cell carcinoma  is another important urological tumour. in  <dig>  rcc is estimated to cause  <dig>  new cases and  <dig>  deaths in the usa  <cit> . rcc is, in most cases, clinically asymptomatic and casually detected by routine ultrasonographic follow-ups in persons otherwise in generally good health  <cit> . the clear cell subtype of rcc  is the most frequent malignant rcc showing an incidence of about 75%  <cit> . it has a worse prognosis in comparison with the papillary and chromophobe rcc subtypes that account for 10% and 5% of rcc, respectively  <cit> . although numerous tumour markers in rcc were tested in the past, to date no definitive biomarkers are available for diagnosis, monitoring, and predicting the outcome of rcc  <cit> . thus, there is an urgent need to search for new markers. to identify potential new candidates gene expression profiles using the dna microarray technique and subsequent rt-pcr assays are helpful tools  <cit> . therefore, we searched for suitable normalization genes for gene expression studies on rcc tissue samples. our strategy was the same as that used in studies of prostate and bladder normalization gene findings  <cit> . using the mesh terms "renal cell carcinoma", "gene expression", and "rt-pcr" combined with the boolean operator "and" we performed a pubmed search of articles published from october  <dig> to august  <dig>  we had access to  <dig> articles that used  <dig> various reference genes . it was remarkable that beta-actin  and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  were used as normalizer genes in about three quarters of all studies. the use of these two genes for normalization is historically grown. although their regulated expression shown under different conditions is inconsistent with their use as normalizers  <cit> , this fact has often been disregarded till now or at least it has not been checked under the study conditions  <cit> . all other housekeeping genes cited accounted for only  <dig> to 6%. only a few studies compared or used more than one reference gene, often in other organisms  <cit>  or under other clinical conditions  <cit> . this literature search clearly proves that an univocal reference gene for gene expression studies in renal cell carcinoma does not exist. the search results additionally emphasize the need for a systematic study to identify suitable reference genes for gene expression studies in renal cell carcinoma.

the aim of this study was to identify suitable reference genes for the purpose of normalization in rcc gene expression studies. therefore, we examined a panel of  <dig> candidate reference genes listed in table  <dig> with regard to their expression behaviour in  <dig> matched malignant and non-malignant rcc tissue samples. this investigation was focused on the clear cell rcc subtype as the most frequent malignant rcc. we selected as potential reference genes either genes taken from the above-mentioned literature search or genes that were shown to be appropriate for normalization in previous studies of other tissues  <cit> . the suitability as reference gene was estimated by comparing the expression stability of the respective gene in malignant and non-malignant tissue using different mathematical procedures and computer programs. the use of unsuitable reference genes in the normalization procedure could result in serious errors in gene expression studies, which could lead to wrong conclusions being drawn  <cit> . these aspects are illustrated by the example of the relative gene quantification of "a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 9"  using up- and down-regulated housekeeping genes as normalizers.

RESULTS
assessment of preanalytical and analytical variables
preanalytical variables like the collection and storage of samples and the process of rna isolation determine the quality of rna that is used for subsequent quantitative expression analyses. rna quality, as a summary parameter, characterizes possible negative effects with regard to deficient procedures of collection and preparation of tissue samples. therefore, the isolated rna samples from the  <dig> matched malignant and non-malignant samples were characterized with regard to their concentration, purity, and integrity. only rna samples with high quality should be included in this study to avoid erroneous conclusions. however, all rna samples isolated from renal tissue specimens preserved in rnalater solution exhibited a high quality. the mean a260/ <dig> ratio of rna samples was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and reflected pure and protein-free rna. the rna integrity as an essential quality criterion was characterized by the so-called rna integrity number  measured on the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer. the mean rin value  of all rna samples was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . the matched malignant and non-malignant tissue samples reached mean rin values  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively, whose difference was significant . preceding orienting comparisons of rin values measured in rna samples isolated from paired tissue specimens stored in rnalater solution or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after surgery showed significantly higher values obtained using the former manner of preservation . we therefore exclusively used rnalater solution for tissue preservation.

there was a strong correlation between the rin values of the paired samples . all gene expression levels both in the malignant and non-malignant samples did not correlate with the rin number  as it was shown as proof for intact, high quality rna  <cit> .

pooled cdna samples were used as precision control materials for each gene-specific pcr run. these control materials were adjusted to the ranges of cp values that were characteristic for the particular genes in the tissue samples. intra-run and between-run analytical performances of the rt-pcr measurements were determined using these control materials. the intra-run precision  was  <dig> % and  <dig> % for actb amplifications with a mean cp-value of  <dig>  and the corresponding mean concentration of  <dig>  arbitrary units, respectively. the between-run variations  ranged from  <dig> %  as the lowest to  <dig> %  as the highest value. corresponding coefficients of variation for the concentrations data ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %.

expression levels of candidate reference genes
paired malignant and non-malignant samples were always measured in the same analytical run to exclude between-run variations. expression levels of the  <dig> investigated candidate reference genes  shown in terms of cp-values are given as box-and-whisker-plots in figure  <dig>  twenty-five matched samples were included in this study. the boxes represent the median cp-values and interquartile ranges, the whiskers indicate the 10– <dig> percentile ranges. since the expressions measured in the two sample groups were not always normally distributed , the non-parametric wilcoxon signed rank test was applied for all significance calculations. genes with higher expression levels show a lower cp-value under the specific pcr conditions and lower expressed genes have reversely higher cycle numbers. the cp-values of all measured genes were between  <dig> and  <dig>  the genes actb, gapdh, ppia, rplpo, sdha, and tubb achieved mean cp-values between  <dig> and  <dig> cycles while the lower expressed genes alas <dig>  hmbs, hprt <dig>  and tbp achieved cp-values between  <dig> and  <dig> cycles. as shown in the figure  <dig>  all genes except ppia and tbp showed significantly different cp-values between the malignant and non-malignant samples. ppia was the highest expressed gene with mean  cp-values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in non-malignant and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in malignant samples. the tbp gene was the lowest expressed gene with mean  cp-values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in non-malignant and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in malignant samples.

significance calculations between gene expression data of paired malignant and non-malignant samples were performed on the basis of concentrations instead of cp-values, taking into account the different pcr efficiencies as indicated in table  <dig>  to facilitate the survey of the results, the differential expression of all  <dig> genes investigated is separately shown for all matched samples . non-regulated , up-regulated , and down-regulated  genes were grouped. significantly different gene expressions between malignant and non-malignant samples were observed for all genes with the exception of the genes ppia  and tbp  . since the smallest mean cp difference is  <dig>  and since retrospective power calculations have yielded a high power , a type ii error can be ruled out with a high probability. the expressions of actb , gapdh , tubb , and rplpo  were significantly increased in malignant compared with the matched non-malignant samples . in contrast, the levels for alas <dig> , hprt <dig> , hmbs , and sdha  were significantly decreased in malignant tissue parts . thus, a statistical type i error for these eight genes is very unlikely because of the low p values. in consequence, only the two genes ppia and tbp fulfil the essential criterion of a reference gene for gene profiling studies in renal cell carcinoma.

except for tubb and gapdh the expression rates of the genes significantly correlated between the malignant and non-malignant samples . the expression of all genes in malignant and non-malignant samples did not depend on age , sex , and tumour stage . the effect of grading could not be estimated, since  <dig> of the  <dig> malignant samples were grade  <dig> and only one had grades  <dig> and  <dig> 

expression stability testing of candidate reference genes
ppia and tbp as the two suitable reference genes were included in the software program genorm  <cit>  to calculate a common normalization factor using the data of these two genes. the application of the normalization factor of these two genes is shown in figure 2c; it yielded comparable data if only one of the two reference genes ppia or tbp was used for normalization. we also included all  <dig> candidate reference genes in the program genorm to calculate the average expression stability value m for all genes without excluding the genes differently expressed in the matched pairs. the ranking order from the most unstable to the most stable genes was as follows: tubb, rplpo, gapdh, actb, sdha, ppia, tbp, hmbs, alas <dig>  and hprt <dig>  the last remaining two genes alas <dig> and hprt <dig> achieved a stability value of  <dig>  as the most stable genes. it is remarkable that all genes had average expression stability m values less than  <dig>  that is defined in the program as stability cutoff value. however, these results show that the program was not able to identify the genes with significant expression differences between malignant and non-malignant sample pairs.

using the normfinder program  <cit>  as another free tool available on the internet to validate the expression stability of the candidate reference genes, the two genes ppia and tbp also achieved the best stability values . with the aid of this program, ppia was identified as the most stable single gene with a stability value of  <dig> . thus, the stability data calculated with that program as a combined estimate of intra- and intergroup expression variations of the genes studied reflect to a certain extent the expression differences of the genes observed in the matched pairs.

a low stability value as an estimate of the combined intra- and intergroup variation of the respective gene corresponds to a high expression stability of the respective gene between the matched malignant and non-malignant samples.

expression levels of target gene influenced by normalization genes
the expression levels of the target gene adam <dig> is used here as an example to demonstrate the effect of different normalization genes on the relative gene expression data. we determined the adam <dig> mrna expression in the same  <dig> rna sample pairs as used for the reference gene search. the adam <dig> expressions were normalized using different strategies . adam <dig> expression values were related either to the single non-regulated reference genes ppia and tbp, the mean ratio of both genes , the normalization factor  obtained for these two genes using the program genorm, or to the three up-regulated genes gapdh, actb, and tubb as well as to the two down-regulated genes alas <dig> and hprt <dig>  to better compare the effect of these different normalization approaches, the relative adam <dig> mrna expression in non-malignant samples was set  <dig>  and expression rates in the matched malignant samples were calculated as multiples . a significant up-regulation of adam <dig> mrna in malignant tissue samples was proved when the normalization approach was performed either with the two stable reference genes ppia and tbp or with the mean ratios of both genes and the normalization factor calculated for the two genes using the genorm program. in contrast, the normalization of adam <dig> expression data on the up-regulated genes resulted in a partly decreased adam <dig> mrna expression, whereas the normalization procedure with the down-regulated genes resulted in an about three-fold enhancement of the up-regulation of adam <dig> mrna expression in malignant tissue samples.

discussion
the essential result of our study evaluating  <dig> candidate reference genes for normalizing gene expressions of clear cell rcc was that only the two genes ppia and tbp did not differ in their expression in malignant and in non-malignant tissue pairs. consequently, only these two genes fulfil the criterion of expression stability between matched tissue samples and could be recommended as accurate normalizers for relative gene quantification in clear cell rcc samples. in the following, this conclusion and data will be discussed, taking into account four main aspects of the current study:  the particular study conditions concerning the preanalytical and analytical variables,  the panel of the candidate reference genes studied,  the validation of suitable reference genes, and  the limitations of the study.

preanalytical and analytical study conditions
like in our previous experiments with reference genes  <cit> , the preanalytical and analytical design of our study is defined by three characteristics: 1) use of paired malignant and non-malignant tissue samples from the same nephrectomized organ; 2) use of high-quality rna samples as precondition for reliable rt-pcr measurements; 3) high analytical performance realized by measurements on the lightcycler. we consider these preconditions essential to achieve a suitable normalization for gene expression studies. recently, huggett et al.  <cit>  recommended a similar approach.

the use of paired samples from the same rcc instead of unpaired samples for comparative gene expression studies has the particular advantage of minimizing the interindividual variation effect and increasing the statistical significance of the study  <cit> . the correlations between the corresponding gene expressions in the malignant and non-malignant tissue samples support the view that interindividual expression variations do occur. in consequence, differential gene expressions can be easier ascertained so that the use of paired samples results in a more exact validation regarding the suitability of reference genes than a study using unpaired samples. therefore, the use of paired samples is the method of choice in identifying suitable reference genes for differential gene studies between malignant and non-malignant samples. in clinical research the detection of different gene expression levels between non-malignant and malignant tissues is an important objective. the results are starting points for further studies on translational stage with the final goal of developing new diagnostic markers or therapeutic approaches. however, in validating of suitable reference genes, one should above all, consider that the expression of candidate reference genes can be influenced by physiological factors like age, sex, pathological factors like the tumour characteristics stage and grade or other biological conditions  <cit> . the results of our data proved that the expression of all genes was not dependent on age, sex, and tumour stage.

another characteristic of our study was the use of high-quality rna samples as an important prerequisite to obtain reliable rt-pcr results  <cit>  for selecting stable reference genes. for expression measurements, we used only rna samples with an a260/a <dig> ratio >  <dig>  and rin values >  <dig> , as an index of high purity and integrity of the rna samples. we controlled the quality of each rna sample with the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer. the principle of the bioanalyzer technology is based on microcapillary electrophoresis  <cit> . electropherograms and gel-like images can be visually evaluated and an expert software can generate an rna integrity number . the rin algorithm evaluates six regions of the electropherogram in addition to the conventional ratio of 28s rrna to 18s rrna  <cit> . the rin allowed a user-independent assessment of rna integrity. although mrna only accounts for 2–5% of total rna, the rin value provides a relevant information concerning downstream applications  <cit> . based on the correlation analysis of rin values to rt-pcr data, schroeder et al.  <cit>  defined for their experiments a rin value of  <dig> as a threshold for high and low rna quality while the low quality rna was considered unacceptable for downstream measurements. collection, storage, and processing of the tissue samples are the essential preanalytical variables that affect the rna integrity as a global indicator of all detrimental processes occurring during the time between the collection of samples after surgery and isolation of rna  <cit> . the isolated high-quality rna in our experiments and the proof of the non-correlation of rin values with the expression results confirmed that possible distorting effects by non-intact rna could be avoided. in addition, the use of rna samples with similar degrees of integrity is shown in our experiments by the strong correlation of the paired rna samples . there was a mean rin difference of only about  <dig>  that minimized the variability of the rna content in the cdna synthesis followed by more stable quantitative rt-pcr data. in fact, auer et al.  <cit>  suggested that samples of comparable rna intactness could be used for microarray analysis despite a certain degradation. our previous experiments have shown that not only the interval time between the removal of the organ and preservation, but also the method of preservation is decisive for the integrity of rna. comparisons of rin values measured in rna isolated from paired tissue samples stored in rnalater solution or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after surgery showed significantly higher values using rnalater-preservation. therefore, we consider the use of rnalater solution as method of choice in preservating renal tissue for obtaining intact rna for reliable expression results. rnalater was also recently recommended for preserving rna integrity in routine clinical kidney biopsy material  <cit> .

the analytical performance of the rt-pcr measurements was characterized by low variation coefficients of cp-values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> % in between-run precision experiments. this high analytical precision, together with the use of paired samples and their measurement in the same analytical run, enabled us to carry out data analysis with high statistical probability.

panel of the candidate reference genes studied
as briefly outlined in the introduction, a systematic study concerning the suitability of reference genes for normalization in rcc expression studies has been lacking so far. schmid et al.  <cit>  performed a medline search about reference genes used in renal tissue in general. although, as reported, we included in our pubmed search only publications concerning rcc , we, like schmidt et al.  <cit> , found gapdh and actb to be the most frequently used genes for normalization. it should be mentioned that the search strategy in pubmed using the mesh terms "renal cell carcinoma" in conjunction with the terms "rt-pcr" and "gene expression" was limited, since published studies not indexed with these terms cannot be found. the reviewer drew our attention to this point after our study was finished. for example, the study by janssens et al.  <cit>  using the gene mitochondrial atp synthase  <dig>  in addition to gapdh and hmbs  as reference genes in various cell lines and tissues was not found with this strategy and was not included in this study. however, we believe that despite this limitation, the overview in table  <dig> served as good starting point for our study. the selection of eight out of the  <dig> candidate reference genes in our study resulted from this search to facilitate comparison, while the two additional genes tubb and sdha were included into the panel of candidate reference genes due to their utility shown in other studies  <cit> . all these candidate reference genes studied are widely used in other studies. our study was performed to search for stable housekeeping genes in a large panel of candidate reference genes covering a broad expression range. the two genes 18s-ribosomal rna and beta-2-microglobulin also commonly applied as normalizers in rcc samples  were not included in our study panel because they belong to the highly expressed and regulated genes in renal tissue  <cit> . moreover, the use of 18s-ribosomal rna as reference gene would be only possible if random primed reverse transcription was carried out for cdna synthesis.

validation of the suitable reference genes
to identify the suitable reference genes as normalizers in gene expression studies, several strategies including computer programs have been recommended  <cit> . there is no doubt that the absence of the differential expression of the candidate reference gene examined in the study groups in question or under conditions to be compared is the strongest proof of suitability. therefore, we proposed to use a two-step strategy for identifying suitable reference genes according to our study design of matched malignant and non-malignant samples  <cit> . first, the expression of the candidate reference genes between the respective study groups or conditions is compared using the appropriate paired tests. it can be assumed that genes with significantly different expressions are not suited to target gene normalization, since they are affected by the study condition in question. those genes should be excluded as normalizers. in the current study, the expression of all genes except that of ppia and tbp varied in the matched malignant and non-malignant samples. the difference in expression was observed not only in the two genes actb and gapdh, which are most frequently used as normalizers in rcc studies, but also in the gene hprt <dig>  the latter was recently recommended as single reference gene for gene expression studies in cancer research  <cit> . it was also identified as a suitable reference gene in rcc samples by haller et al.  <cit>  using the equivalence test. however, this discrepancy to our results might be due to the fact that haller et al.  <cit>  only studied  <dig> paired samples with an obviously lower statistical power compared with that in our experiments with  <dig> paired samples.

in the second step of our approach, we generally calculated the best-performing reference genes using the genorm and normfinder programs  <cit> . whereas in prostate cancer and bladder cancer experiments  <dig> out of  <dig> and six out of nine genes, respectively, remained as suitable genes for the further calculations with genorm and normfinder  <cit> , only the two genes ppia and tbp could be considered for these analyses in the current study. it is worth mentioning that the genorm program was unable to detect candidate reference genes that were characterized as unsuitable reference genes in the first step of suitability testing. in contrast, normfinder recognized ppia and tbp as the two best-performing reference genes when all candidate reference genes were included for the calculation .

a target gene normalization was used as an example to illustrate the validation of a suitable reference gene selected from a panel of candidate reference genes. we used "a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 9"  as the target gene. without going into details about the possible significance of adam <dig> in rcc tumourigenesis, we can say that the various relative quantification methods shown here can result in serious gene quantification errors if unsuitable reference genes are used . we recommend the use of ppia and tbp for normalizing expression results using the mean ratio of relative quantification with the two reference genes. although the advantage of using both reference genes for normalizing is not clearly evident in our study, other authors showed a more accurate normalization when more than one reference gene was used  <cit> .

limitations of this study
some limitations of this study should be mentioned. the first limitation could be seen in the limited number of samples used in the current study. in contrast to this limitation, it is remarkable that even with the possibly low statistical power due to the limited number of samples, clearly significant results of eight candidate reference genes were obtained. thus, as explained in the previous section, the risk of a type ii error and also of a type i error is rather unlikely as the problem with small studies does not exist in our study. second, the present study is limited to the clear cell rcc subtype. however, that type is the most frequent malignant rcc. the expression of the two recommended reference genes ppia and tbp in the papillary or chromophobe rcc subtypes was not studied and it would be necessary to confirm their potential use in further studies. third, the study was partly unbalanced with regard to sex, tumour stage, and grade. the study included  <dig> males, but only  <dig> females. however, since there were no differences for all genes studied, we can assume, despite this unbalanced design, that the expression did not depend on sex. similarly, the tumour stage obviously did not influence the expression level as shown in the results. twenty-three out of  <dig> samples had the tumour grade  <dig>  whereas it can be assumed that at least ppia and tbp are suitable reference genes for grade  <dig>  their usefulness as normalizer in grade  <dig> rcc samples remains to be verified. fourth, although we examined the most comprehensive panel of potential housekeeping genes in comparison with other studies, we measured only  <dig> genes, excluding genes very rarely used for renal cell carcinoma due to the limited sample material available . thus, the question remains unanswered whether these or other genes including the mitochondrial atp synthase  <dig> gene mentioned above are equivalent to or more suitable than the recommended genes ppia and tbp.

CONCLUSIONS
the two housekeeping genes ppia and tbp are the sole stably expressed genes from a panel of  <dig> candidate reference genes studied in matched malignant and non-malignant tissue samples from the clear cell rcc. both genes are recommended as reference genes for relative gene quantification in gene profiling studies either as single gene or preferably in combination.
