BACKGROUND
plant cells are able to sense and transduce signals through cell surface receptors which mediate the cell-to-cell communication by binding to the extracellular ligands and possessing protein kinase catalytic activities  <cit> . in  <dig>  the first plant receptor-like kinase  was identified in maize  <cit>  and since then, many rlks have been identified from other plant species. according to the classification based on the extracellular domains, the major group of plant rlk is the leucine-rich repeat rlk family   <cit> . the structural features of lrr-rlks include an extracellular receptor domain to perceive signals, a single-pass transmembrane domain to anchor the protein within the membrane and a cytoplasmic serine/threonine  protein kinase domain to transduce the signal downstream via autophosphorylation followed by further phosphorylation of specific substrates  <cit> .

previous reports have classified plant lrr-rlk genes into two broad categories  <cit> . first, they are important in plant growth and development including morphogenesis, organogenesis and hormone signaling. second, many lrr-rlks respond to abiotic and biotic stress and therefore could be defense-related. some lrr-rlks have been demonstrated to possess dual functions due to the cross-talk between defense and developmental pathways or due to the recognition of multiple ligands by one signal receptor  <cit> . for instance, erecta is involved in both ovule development and resistance to bacterial wilt  <cit> . although important progress has been made in understanding lrr-rlk functions in recent years, open questions still remain for most lrr-rlks. the phenotypes associated with various lrr-rlk mutants show that they play roles in diverse processes during growth and development  <cit> . meanwhile, the functional redundancy of lrr-rlk family members definitely adds to the complexity of the signaling network they mediate. for example, clavata <dig>  forms a receptor complex with clv <dig> upon perception of the clv3/esr-related  peptide derived from clv <dig> in the shoot apical meristem to regulate the expression pattern of the stem cell-promoting transcription factor wuschel   <cit> . in parallel with clv <dig>  additional receptors, namely barely any meristem , exhibit similar sequences as clv <dig> but perform seemingly contradictory functions. while clv <dig> promotes stem cell differentiation, bam receptors are required for stem cell maintenance  <cit> . it has been shown that clv <dig> and bam receptors have retained significant similarity in their biochemical function and the differences in their genetic functions appear to be largely driven by their distinctive expression patterns  <cit> .

lrr-rlks seem to have evolved to acquire novel and diverse functions through neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization by extensive gene duplication  <cit> . the drastic expansion of this gene family in the land plant lineage is regarded as a plant-specific adaptation for extracellular signal sensing and propagation  <cit> . as a forest model organism, poplar is a fast-growing diploid plant that has attracted much attention since its whole genome being sequenced  <cit> . the structural features and expression profiles of lrr-rlk gene family members have been extensively described in arabidopsis and rice, however, there has been much less information about this family in woody species including poplar. in the current study, the entire lrr-rlk gene family of populus trichocarpa was comprehensively identified and analyzed by incorporating sequence phylogeny, gene organization, conserved motif, expression profiling, and gene adaption analysis. our results provide a framework for further functional investigation on populus lrr-rlks and contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of lrr-rlk gene family in higher plants.

RESULTS
composition and phylogenetic analysis of lrr-rlk gene family in populus trichocarpa
to date, approximately  <dig> and  <dig> lrr-rlk genes have been identified in the fully sequenced arabidopsis and rice genomes, respectively  <cit> . in this work, a larger lrr-rlk gene family composed of  <dig> members was identified in the p. trichocarpa genome. the number of lrr-rlk genes in populus is roughly  <dig>  fold of that in arabidopsis, which is consistent with the ratio of putative populus homologues to each arabidopsis gene   <cit> . the detailed information of lrr-rlk family genes in populus including the accession numbers and the characteristics of the encoded proteins is listed in additional file  <dig> and the summarized information concerning each group or subgroup is presented in table  <dig>  since the diversity of extracellular domains  represents the capability of lrr-rlks to recognize various ligands and thus constitute the basis of their functional versatility  <cit> , we first identified the ecd for each ptlrr-rlk and constructed the phylogenetic tree to determine their evolutionary relationship . it has been shown that many events which resulted in the fusion between ecds and kinase domains occurred early in land plant evolution, thus rlk genes with related kinase sequences tend to have similar ecds  <cit> . in this work, the phylogenetic relationship among the ptlrr-rlks was also examined based on their catalytic kinase domains and similar categories were obtained . since the nodes of the phylogenetic tree based on the ecds exhibit the best confidence of support, ptlrr-rlks were classified into  <dig> subfamilies  accordingly . no well-supported positions could be identified for six ptlrr-rlks, so they were not included in the phylogeny . when ptlrr-rlks were clustered with atlrr-rlks , the numbering for the populus lrr-rlk subfamilies was determined based on the nomenclature of the majority of arabidopsis homologues within the same group. the populus subfamilies i, ii, iii and xiii were grouped together with arabidopsis lrr-rlks involved in organ/tissue development and with the ones involved in defense signaling. group iv included only two arabidopsis inflorescence meristem receptor-like kinase  genes which are involved in cell fate specification and proliferation. group v included the arabidopsis strubbelig-receptor family  gene family members that affect different aspects of cell wall biology  <cit>  and the scm gene involved in root hair specification  <cit> . group vi, vii, viii and ix had no arabidopsis orthologs with identified functions. group x was grouped together with arabidopsis genes involved in brassinosternoid and peptide signaling such as bak1-interacting receptor <dig> , bak1-interacting receptor-like , and phytosulfokin receptor1- <dig>  genes  <cit> . subgroups xi-a and xi-b were represented with arabidopsis lrr-rlks with important roles in organ morphogenesis, cell fate specification and vascular development such as clv <dig> and phloem intercalated with xylem   <cit> , while in the subgroup xi-c, pep <dig> receptor1- <dig>  is involved in abscisic acid signaling and defense response  <cit> . for group xii, subgroup xii-b is populus specific and subgroup xii-a was clustered with flagellin-sensitive <dig>  and ef-tu receptor  which take part in innate immunity against pathogens  <cit> . group xiv only included excess microsporocytes <dig>  gene, which is involved in endosperm and pollen development  <cit> . the dispersal pattern of  <dig> arabidopsis lrr-rlks with well-defined roles prompted consideration of the ancestral role of distinct ptlrr-rlk subfamilies and there is a possibility that ptlrr-rlks belonging to distinct subfamilies perform certain functions in different developmental aspects. for example, the subgroups xi-a and b are more likely to be involved in plant growth and development, while xi-c could be more likely to take roles in plant-microbe interactions. the large size of the populus lrr-rlk gene family has been regarded as a indication of a great need for lrr-rlk genes to participate in more complicated transcriptional regulations in woody species  <cit> . meanwhile, the species-specific genes could play important roles in plant responses to a variation of biotic factors, such as the variation of the spectrum of pathogens  <cit> , so it would be very attractive to investigate the functions of the poplar-specific subgroups identified in this work.

sequence characteristics of each ptlrr-rlk gene subfamily and its phylogenetic relationship with arabidopsis lrr-rlks with known functions are shown. six ptlrr-rlk proteins did not fit well into clusters. subgroups that do not include any arabidopsis lrr-rlk proteins are described as populus-specific. information on the agi code, gene full-name and abbreviation for each atlrr-rlk gene with defined functions is presented in the additional file  <dig> 

intron–exon organizations of ptlrr-rlks
the presence of multiple introns has been shown to be essential for erecta expression in arabidopsis <cit> , so the intron–exon organizations of ptlrr-rlks were examined for a clearer understanding of their potential functions. additional file  <dig> provides the detailed illustration of the distribution and position of introns for each ptlrr-rlk genes and figure  <dig> listed the representative intron/exon structures and their distributions among different gene subfamilies . out of  <dig> populus lrr-rlk genes,  <dig> had alternative mrna splicing modes and  <dig> genes had no intron. one, two, three, four, and five introns was found in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. one hundred and fifteen genes had more than five introns and  <dig> out of them had more than ten introns . in terms of exon/intron organization, most of the closely related populus lrr-rlk genes have roughly the same number and location of introns , which strongly supports their close evolutionary relationship. populus and arabidopsis genes belonging to the same subfamilies also exhibit similar genomic features. for example, the gene structure of the populus subfamily xi were fairly simple and has only one or two introns over their full length sequence, except three genes in the subgroup xi-b which contain as many as  <dig> introns. arabidopsis homologues of this group have been shown to play important roles in plant development and organogenesis and most of them contained less than two introns except erecta and erecta-like1- <dig>  which contained as many as  <dig> introns, this is the most complicated intron/exon structure of atlrr-rlks. although all of the  <dig> atlrr-rlks with known functions could be matched with populus homologues with similar intron/exon structures, the exactly same genetic structures as atlrr-rlks were only found in populus group v, xi and xiii and interestingly, all of them are developmental genes responsible for cell fate specification and morphogenesis . these results confirmed that the common ancestral genes of ptlrr-rlks and atlrr-rlks already possess multiple intron/exon structures and probably the complicated mrna processing modes as well. meanwhile, it seemed possible that the development-related lrr-rlk genes are more conserved in the evolution of genetic structures than the defense-related lrr-rlks due to their indispensible roles for plant life.

conserved motifs of ptlrr-rlk genes
to further reveal the diversification and functional potentials of populus lrr-rlks, their conserved motifs were investigated and the consistency of domain arrangement for each subfamily was determined using the multiple em for motif elicitation  motif detection software  <cit> . the lrr motif is usually composed of 20– <dig> residues with conserved leucines  <cit>  and the consensus residues within the lrr motif were thought to provide a structural skeleton for protein-protein interactions and non-consensus residues within lrrs are though to determine the specificity of such interactions  <cit> . in total,  <dig> lrr-related motifs were identified among ptlrr-rlk family members and the basic lrr motif was concluded as lxxlxlxxnx l/f sgx i/l pxx l/i gxlxx, which shows a good match to the plant lrr consensus lxxlxlxxnxlxgxipxxlxxlxx and was slightly different from the basic lrr motif in rice   <cit> . the most conserved amino acid residues in populus lrr motifs were gly at position  <dig>  pro at position  <dig>  leu at position  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and asn at position  <dig>  ile at positions  <dig> and leu at position  <dig> are often substituted by each other and leu at position  <dig> is often replaced by phe . some repeats contain additional conserved residues in other positions, such as a gly at position  <dig> of the m <dig> repeat; ser residue at position  <dig> of the m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> repeat. since the repetitive structure of lrr makes it capable of the rapid generation of new variants by duplications and deletions of entire repeats  <cit> , the repeat number and distribution of lrr motif have been regarded as important parameters to reflect the evolutionary history. for ptlrr-rlks, most of the closely related members in the phylogenetic tree kept similar motifs, providing additional support for their phylogenetic relations . the conserved motifs in the lrr-rlk proteins within the same subfamily may suggest their functional similarities and divergence in motif composition may indicate their functional diversity  <cit> . although no group- or subgroup-specific lrr motif was identified, members of different subfamilies did exhibit various degree of complexity in terms of the lrr motif composition . the most complicated motif composition was observed for the group xi which included all  <dig> types of lrr motif and in contrast, the group i and ii had only  <dig> to  <dig> lrr motifs. in addition to the motif composition, the similarity in terms of the arrangement of different lrr motifs also varied among subfamilies . the arrangement was almost identical for members of subfamily ii, iii, v, ix and xii-b. the variation in lrr patterns gets more obvious among the members of other subfamilies, although after careful comparison, several clades sharing a regular motif arrangement could still be identified for each subfamily . the high divergence in the alignments of lrr motif within one subfamily could reflect the functional diversity among their members. in addition to lrr motifs, non-lrr motifs were also identified in the extracellular regions of ptlrr-rlk . common motifs including m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> could be identified in the n-terminal for most of ptlrr-rlks, while m <dig> could be found at the c-terminal for most ptlrr-rlks. different from these common motifs are certain non-lrr motifs which appear to be subfamily-specific, for example, the motif m <dig> only appeared in most members of viii . ptlrr-rlks sharing the same or similar motif composition and arrangement could be identified for  <dig> out of  <dig> atlrr-rlks with known functions , which supports the theory that the domain organization of most rlk/pelle subfamilies was established before the monocot–dicot split  <cit> .

when the trans-membrane  domains were predicted by tmhmm, in a total of  <dig> ptlrr-rlks,  <dig> had one tm and  <dig> ptlrr-rlks did not have any tm. further analysis of the remaining  <dig> ptlrr-rlks with two tms revealed one of them is atypical. the rlk domain of most ptlrr-rlk consists of approximately 250– <dig> amino acid residues with a maximum of  <dig> and a minimum of  <dig>  in literature, plant rlk could be divided into  <dig> conserved subdomains  from n- to c-terminal  <cit> . in the 2- lobed structure of the rlk domain, the smaller lobe is composed of subdomains i to iv and is involved in anchoring and orienting the nucleotide. the larger lobe is composed of subdomain vi to xi and is largely responsible for binding the peptide substrate and initiating phosphor-transfer  <cit> . in the kinase part of all ptlrr-rlks,  <dig> motifs are identified which are similar to those identified for rice lrr-rlks and were named as  <dig> to  <dig> according to the frequencies of their appearance . although most motifs did not seem to be subfamily-specific, motif  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> only appeared in the subgroup vii and motif  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> only showed up in the subfamily xii. since only these two subfamilies included a populus-specific clade in the phylogenic tree, these specific motifs may, to some extent, attribute to the functional divergence of these subfamily members in poplar.

kinase is commonly referred to as arginine-aspartate  kinases if it is strongly activated by the phosphorylation of the activation loop and they usually contain an arg in the subdomain preceding the catalytic loop  <cit> . conversely, a smaller number of kinases are referred to as non-arginine-aspartate  kinases which lack the conserved r in subdomain vi  <cit> . it has been proposed that the signal of pathogen recognition mediated by rlks is usually through a non-rd kinase  <cit> . in ptlrr-rlks, about half are rd-kinases including all the members of subfamily vii and ix. interestingly, no arabidopsis homolog with known functions has been identified for these two subfamilies and the vii-b subfamily is populus-specific. in contrast, all members in the subfamily iii, iv, v and xii are non-rd kinases although the arabidopsis lrr-rlks grouped with them take part in both defense and development .

contributions of tandem and large-scale duplications to the family size of ptlrr-rlks
the explosion of members of a gene family has generally occurred as the result of repetitive tandem duplication  and segmental and/or whole genome duplication events . ptlrr-rlk genes were comprehensively distributed within the poplar genome and  <dig> genes are localized to unassembled genomic sequence scaffolds and thus could not be mapped to any particular chromosome . approximately 82%  ptlrr-rlk genes are located in the replicated region, which is different from rice and arabidopsis in which the frequencies of genes generated by s/wgds are much lower   <cit> . among them,  <dig> genes lacked duplicates on the corresponding duplicated blocks, suggesting that dynamic rearrangement, mutation or segmental loss may have occurred following the segmental duplication. according to previous literature, a chromosome region containing two or more genes within  <dig> kb can be defined as a gene cluster  <cit> . in poplar,  <dig> ptlrr-rlk genes were located in  <dig> tandem duplication clusters . the smallest tandem duplication clusters consisted of only  <dig> genes and the largest cluster had  <dig> tightly linked genes on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  the clusters were distributed unevenly among the  <dig> phylogenetic groups, and populus-specific subgroup vii-b contains  <dig> clusters incorporating  <dig> % of the genes of this subgroup. by contrast, group ii, iii, iv, v, vi, ix had no clusters present .

differential expression profiles of populus lrr-rlk genes
to gain a broader understanding of the function of lrr-rlks, we analyzed the divergence among populus lrr-rlk genes in spatial and temporal expression and expression in response to specific environmental signals. probe sets were readily identifiable for  <dig> out of  <dig> ptlrr-rlks in the popgenexpress data set, and their distinct transcript abundance patterns were retrieved by the populus electronic fluorescent pictograph  browser  <cit> . most populus lrr-rlk genes demonstrated distinct tissue specific expression patterns except for mature leaves, where all have low transcriptional levels . filtering was added to select genes that had at least a 2-fold higher expression in one specific tissue compared to the median expression level of all analyzed tissues. out of the ptlrr-rlk genes for which microarray data are available, 28%, 29%, 15%, 27% and 19% showed specific transcript accumulations in young leaf, roots, female catkins, male catkins and developing xylem, respectively . identification of the genes predominantly expressed in meristem tissues provides an important clue for their functions during cell fate specification and organ formation. therefore, the expression of ptlrr-rlks in multiple meristem tissues was investigated which may provide a further solid basis to select meristem-specific genes for related functional validation .

out of  <dig> tandem duplicated gene clusters,  <dig> clusters exhibited similar expression patterns among genes with expression data available . it has been reported that in both rice and arabidopsis, more than 50% of duplicate lrr-rlk gene pairs that were generated by a whole genome duplication event exhibited expressional divergence  <cit> . in poplar, among  <dig> pairs of lrr-rlk paralogs with expression data available,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  pairs shared >80%, 60-80% and <60% similarities over their full amino acid sequences, respectively. when expression patterns were compared, 70%, 30% and 0% pairs shared similar expression pattern in group i, ii and iii, respectively . thus, the expressional diversity of duplicated genes in poplar was correlated with the sequence variation which may represent a dynamic functional diversification of this gene family over evolutionary time and contribute to the adaptability of trees. among the  <dig> arabidopsis lrr-rlks with known functions,  <dig> genes showed obvious tissue-specific expression instead of a whole-plant expression as illustrated by efp and for  <dig> genes, their populus homologues showed a similar spatial expression pattern . this result supports that orthologous genes from different species may retain similar temporal and spatial expression patterns  <cit> .

by complete searching of the digital expression profiles from the gene expression omnibus  repository at ncbi website, we also investigated the expression patterns of the ptlrr-rlk genes during shoot organogenesis and in response to various stress stimulus including drought, cold, hypoxia, nitrogen limitation, aluminum stress in roots, bacteria, fungi and mimic wounding . in a total of  <dig> treatments, the expression profile of ptlrr-rlks varied considerably when exposed to  <dig> treatments, except for infection by marssonina pathogen and melampsora rust fungi, drought and aluminum stress in roots. genes responsive to various treatments were summarized as heat maps in additional file  <dig>  the percentages of members of each subfamily being induced or suppressed for each treatment were listed in additional file  <dig> and summarized in the format of heatmap in figure  <dig>  it can be seen that lrr-rlks respond to various stimulates in a temporal and spatial manner by changing the expression profiles of different gene sets. for example, in wounding experiment,  <dig> hours after treatment ,  <dig> and  <dig> ptlrr-rlk genes were up-regulated in leaf lpi <dig> and root, respectively, and qualitative differences in the induction patterns were detected for these two types of tissue . when the sampling time was extended to one week , only  <dig> and  <dig> genes were detected as induced in lpi <dig> leaves and lpi <dig> leaves, respectively, and compared to very young leaves , the older leaves with lpi <dig> were much more enriched with up-regulated lrr-rlks, which were overrepresented by members from subfamily iii, iv, v, ix and xi-b . in another assay, the gene expression response of populus tremuloides cell suspension cultures to methyl jasmonate feeding was analyzed; the transcript level of  <dig> ptlrr-rlks was elevated. all these data indicated that lrr-rlk gene family plays an indispensable role in wounding defense of tree species. when confronted with ammonium shortage, at a 4-week checkpoint, the induction was more dramatic in young leaves  than the older leaves . with the progression of the ammonium shortage, the transcript of lrr-rlks from subfamily iii, iv, ix and xi-b got obviously repressed in the older leaves . when the effect of hypoxia on gene expression was investigated in grey poplar,  <dig> genes responded by induction in leaves with only  <dig> genes got induced in roots. this located induction pattern may imply the localized functions of different ptlrr-rlk members. from figure  <dig>  it was seen that members of different lrr-rlk subfamilies act in an overlapping manner when dealing with different stimulus which indicated that cross talk and signal integration exist among different signaling pathways mediated by ptlrr-rlks. in terms of down-regulation, several things need to be pointed out . first, members of vii and xiv subfamily were highly repressed in lpi <dig> leaves one week after wounding. second, only  <dig> ptlrr-rlk genes got transcriptionally induced in the winter survival and maintenance mechanism of p. trichocarpa,  <dig> genes responded with repression instead . third, in the hypoxia treatment, with more than 90% of the induced genes was located in the leaf tissue, 88% down-regulated genes were found in the root tissue instead. in summary, although it is hard to assign distinct roles to different populus lrr-rlk subfamilies based on the results of limited microarray analysis, it could be reasonable to suggest that ptlrr-rlks are widely involved in different aspects of plant development in both normal and stressed circumstances. however, subset of arabidopsis lrr-rlk genes have previously been shown to play crucial roles in biotic stress response . two biotic signals, marssonina pathogen and melampsora rust fungi, did not cause significant change of gene expression profiles in the current study, which indicates a need for more microarray experiments to better understand the roles of populus lrr-rlk genes in biotic defense. for trees, it is unlikely to generate a collection of lrr-rlk t-dna insertion mutants, as in arabidopsis, to be easily applied for the analysis of other developmental aspects. the results from this study could provide insights into possible functions for some ptlrr-rlks before future functional analyses would eventually elucidate their biological meanings.

CONCLUSIONS
characterization of lrr-rlk genes in a ligneous species would facilitate a better understanding of the evolutionary processes and functions of this gene family. the current work shows that the lrr-rlks represent a large gene family in populus trichocarpa. gene structures, motif composition and arrangements are considerably conserved among the groups. the distribution of genes was found to be non-random across chromosomes and a high proportion of the genes are located in segmental duplicated regions instead of tandem duplicated clusters. for most of the  <dig> arabidopsis with known functions, populus homologues always could be identified with similar genetic structure, motif character and expression profiles, providing insight into the evolutionary and functional conservation of this gene family in plant species. expression patterns based on microarray data suggest that many ptlrr-rlk genes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and responsive to various stresses. data in this work may provide valuable information for future investigations to reveal the functional divergence and adaptive evolution of this gene family in tree species.
