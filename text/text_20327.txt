BACKGROUND
chitin is an abundant natural polymer, second only in biomass to cellulose  <cit> . it is a common constituent of crustacean exoskeletons and arthropod cuticles  <cit>  as well as the cell walls of most fungi  <cit> . there is an estimated  <dig> gigatons of chitin recycled in nature each year  <cit> .

chitosan is a polymer of n-glucosamine obtained by partial chitin n-deacetylation  <cit> . acid hydrolysis or enzymatic cleavage of the glycosidic linkages of chitosan chains  <cit> , yields shorter chains of <1- <dig> kda chitosan oligosaccharides . these polymers are less than  <dig> glucosamine monomers and are more water soluble and readily absorbed in vivo compared to chitosan  <cit> .

allan and hadwiger  <cit>  first showed the fungicidal effect of chitosan, and since then, several studies have examined chitosan sensitivity in different fungi  <cit> . chitosan inhibits both hyphal growth and spore germination  <cit>  and reduces toxin production by plant pathogenic fungi  <cit> . recently, chitosan has been shown to increase conidiation in filamentous fungi at concentrations where hyphal growth was impaired  <cit> . together these observations suggest that chitosan exerts its antifungal activity by multiple mechanisms.

we used cos in our study rather than chitosan because it is more soluble and biologically active. the biological activity of chitosan and cos is dependent on its molecular weight, degree of deacetylation and ph of the medium  <cit> . high degrees of deacetylation and an acidic ph  yield the highest activity against susceptible fungi  <cit> .

the antibiotic activity of chitosan and cos  <cit>  is likely due to the permeabilization of bacterial plasma membranes  <cit> . plasma membrane damage has also been suggested as an explanation of the fungicidal effects of chitosan in yeast and filamentous fungi  <cit> . plasma membrane permeabilization by chitosan has also been detected  in saccharomyces cerevisiae, where deletion of genes encoding for proteins involved in maintaining plasma membrane integrity increased chitosan sensitivity  <cit> . although it has been speculated that plasma membrane permeabilization by chitosan in bacteria and fungi is associated with the interaction between the positive amino groups of chitosan and the negative charges of phospholipids, no conclusive data are available  <cit> .

to gain a better understanding of the mode of action of small  chitosan oligosaccharides , and identify putative resistance mechanisms, we performed three chemogenomic screens  <cit> . these assays examined the effect of gene dosage to uncover bona fide targets of cos in yeast. two chemogenomics assays interrogate the yeast deletion collection  in a single culture in parallel. each deletion strain in this collection contains a unique 20-base-pair dna tag used to quantify the fitness of individual strains using an oligonucleotide array  <cit> . both essential heterozygous and non-essential homozygous diploids were assayed. the haploinsufficiency profiling  assay identifies genes that show increased drug sensitivity in heterozygous deletion strains. the heterozygous deletion strain that is most sensitive to a given compound often indentifies its target  <cit> . the homozygous profiling  assay identifies genes that buffer the drug target pathway and are required for resistance to the compound  <cit> . a multicopy suppression profiling  screen, where genes are overexpressed to identify those that confer resistance to the compound of interest was also performed  <cit> . the genes identified from the chemogenomic assays were individually validated to confirm their involvement in cos sensitivity or resistance. for five of the strains that conferred resistance when overexpressed, we performed a transcriptional analysis. the arl <dig>  gene was identified in the hip-hop and msp chemogenomics assays as being involved in yeast resistance to cos- <dig> . this gene encodes a soluble gtpase that is a member of the ras superfamily and has been shown to be involved in membrane traffic regulation  <cit> . arl <dig> overexpression strains showed decreased cos-induced permeability compared to wild type cells. because cos is a cell stress causing agent, we compared the transcriptional response induced by cos to those of other environmental stressors and ascertained whether an environmental stress pretreatment could provide resistance to cos. finally, we evaluated whether a cos-resistant arl <dig> overexpressing strain is also resistant to other antifungal compounds.

RESULTS
sensitivity to chitosan and cos- <dig>  treatment in the yeast deletion pools
a scheme summarizing the experiments and analyses performed in this study is shown in figure  <dig>  we first compared yeast sensitivity to deacetylated chitosan  and to chitosan oligosaccharide  . cos  had considerably higher antifungal activity than chitosan at equivalent concentrations . because of this, it is easier to more consistently manufacture this form, we decided to use cos as the antifungal agent. the heterozygous and homozygous yeast deletion collections were grown in ypd with  <dig>  μg/ml cos- <dig> , a concentration that inhibited yeast wild type growth by  <dig> – 20% compared with the control . in the hip-hop assays,  <dig> yeast deletion strains sensitive to cos- <dig>  were indentified .

 <dig> cos- <dig>  log <dig> ratio is calculated from tag <dig> array data for each tag of each deletion strain. cos- <dig>  log <dig> ratio = log <dig> /, where μc is the mean intensity of the control sample, μt is the mean intensity of the treated samples, and bg is the mean intensity of the unassigned probes. this score is proportional to the log <dig> ratio of cells present in the control sample versus the treatment sample   <cit> .

 <dig> fitness score  is estimated from the average growth curves  of a given strain in the presence and absence of cos after  <dig> h. the fitness scores from three individual colonies of each deletion strain grown in triplicate  were used to calculate the average. this score takes into account the growth of the wild type and deletion strain in control conditions as well as treatment conditions. wc = wtc/stc; wt = wtt/stt, where wc is the fitness score under control  conditions, wtis the fitness score after treatment, wt is doubling time of wild type strain, st is doubling time of the deletion strain, c is control conditions, t is treatment  conditions. normalized fitness  = avg wt/avg wc <cit> . a fitness score less than  <dig> indicates that the strain is sensitive  <cit> . a minimum difference of  <dig>   was used as a cut-off to consider a strain sensitive.

 <dig> deletion pool source identifies which pool of deletion strains the deleted strain came from. het - heterozygous essential deletions strains, hom - homozygous deletion strains.

a previous global fitness analysis, similar to the hip-hop assay we performed, identified  <dig> chitosan sensitive homozygous and three heterozygous deletion strains,  <cit> . approximately 10% of the homozygous deletion strains found in their study were among the genes identified in our screen , but none of the three heterozygous deletions strains corresponded to those identified in our screen.

biological processes  associated with the cos- <dig>  sensitive deletion strains were determined using gene set enrichment analysis   <cit> . the enriched processes included rna biology , membrane functions , membrane structural components , cell division  and proteasome processes . similar go terms showed altered fitness in the presence of chitosan in a similar fitness analysis  <cit> .

to confirm whether the  <dig> deletion strains were sensitive to cos on their own, we tested each strain individually and found that  <dig>  were inhibited by cos .

resistance to cos- <dig>  treatment in the multicopy suppression profiling pool
msp assays involve the transformation of yeast with a multicopy suppression plasmid library containing random fragments of approximately  <dig> kbp pieces of dna. the msp assay was performed with  <dig>  –  <dig>  μg/ml cos- <dig>  and it was determined that  <dig>  μg/ml cos- <dig>  inhibited wild type yeast growth by at least 70% . yeast containing suppression plasmids that provide resistance to  <dig>  μg/ml cos- <dig>  will expand more quickly than the rest of the yeast of the population. genomic dnas from a resistant population and a transformed but untreated population are extracted and hybridized to orf microarrays to identify genes present in multicopies in the resistant population.

two independent replicates of the msp screen identified a total of  <dig> genes as putative suppressors of cos- <dig>  sensitivity . the random genomic dna fragments in the multicopy suppression plasmid library contain on average  <dig> –  <dig> yeast genes per fragment  <cit> . only one gene in each fragment is likely responsible for resistance; therefore we expected only 33-50% of these genes to be confirmed as suppressors of cos- <dig>  . there were  <dig> and  <dig> suppressing genes in replicates  <dig> and  <dig> respectively with only  <dig> genes in common . the  <dig> genes were: pkr <dig>  a v-atpase assembly factor in the endoplasmic reticulum  which functions with other v-atpase assembly factors to efficiently assemble the v-atpase membrane sector; cox5a, subunit va of cytochrome c oxidase, involved in mitochondrial electron transport; flo <dig>  a lectin-like cell wall protein involved in flocculation that binds to mannose on the surface of other cells; vac <dig>  a vacuolar membrane protein involved in inheritance and vacuole morphology; rpl20a, a large ribosomal subunit protein; and msg <dig>  a dual specificity phosphatase protein required for maintenance of low level signaling through the cell integrity pathway which regulates and is regulated by slt2p. three of these genes, pkr <dig>  vac <dig> and msg <dig>  were also found to be sensitive to cos when tested as single heterozygous deletion strains. among the suppressing genes found in replicate  <dig>  arl <dig>  a gene encoding a gtpase protein, was identified. this gene was found to be sensitive to cos- <dig>  as a deletion strain in the hip-hop assay .

confirmation of cos suppressing strains
after the identification of putative resistant strains we tested each strain individually. from the  <dig> candidate suppressor genes,  <dig> individual overexpressing/suppressing strains each containing a single putative resistance gene were obtained from a collection of orfs whose expression is driven by native promoters  <cit>  see methods. twenty-one  of the putative suppressor genes conferred resistance to cos- <dig>  when tested in this manner . cos- <dig>  resistant overexpressing strains were able to grow in  <dig>  μg/ml cos- <dig>  while the wild type  was unable to grow .

 <dig> genes selected for transcriptomic analysis.

 <dig> overexpressing strains confirmed as suppressors when overexpressed and sensitive when tested as deletion strains.

3– <dig> fitness score  is estimated from the average growth curves  of a given strain in the presence and absence of cos after  <dig> h. data shown corresponds to deletion strains exposed to  <dig>  μg/ml and overexpressing strains to  <dig>  μg/ml of chitosan oligosaccharide. the fitness scores from three individual colonies of each overexpressing or deletion strain grown in triplicate  were used to calculate the average. this score takes into account the growth of the wild type and overexpressing or deletion strain in control conditions as well as treatment conditions. wc = wtc/stc; wt = wtt/stt, where wc is the fitness score under control  conditions, wtis the fitness score after treatment, wt is doubling time of wild type strain, st is doubling time of the overexpressing or deletion strain, c is control conditions, t is treatment  conditions. normalized fitness  = avg wt/avg wc <cit> . a fitness score less than  <dig> indicates that the strain is sensitive, a fitness score above  <dig> indicates that the strain is resistant  <cit> . means that the strain has a treatment induced growth defect, a minimum difference of  <dig>   was used as a cut-off to consider a strain sensitive.

among the confirmed genes that confer resistance to cos- <dig>  were two essential genes: rba <dig> , a gene whose protein product is involved in transcription, and arp <dig> , a gene encoding actin related protein  <dig>  a subunit of the arp2/ <dig> complex which is required for the motility and integrity of cortical actin patches. among the remaining  <dig> non-essential genes, a diversity of functions were found, such as a sterol reductase, a heat shock protein, adp-ribosylation factors, soluble gtpases, alpha tubulin, and a ubiquitin conjugation enzyme. putative suppressors of cos antifungal action in yeast were all tested as heterozygous deletion strains and from the  <dig> resistant overexpressing strains,  <dig> were found to be sensitive when tested as heterozygous deletion strains . five genes that provided cos resistance when overexpressed or sensitivity as a heterozygous or homozygous deletion strain were selected for further study primarily based on the known or putative functions of the genes. more specifically we selected genes with roles in signalling pathways, cell or membrane integrity, or transcription regulation.

we selected the following  <dig> overexpressing strains: arl <dig>  which encodes a gtpase involved in membrane trafficking, was selected because it was found in the hip-hop assay as a sensitive homozygous deletion strain and in the msp assay as a multicopy suppressor. the other overexpressing strains we selected were: bck <dig> and msg <dig>  which are both involved in cell integrity pathways; erg <dig>  a gene involved in ergosterol synthesis; and rba <dig> . bck <dig> is a ser-thr rich protein with protein kinase c activity that acts in signal transduction. overexpression of bck <dig> can rescue defects in a cwh43Δ mutant that displays several cell wall defects  <cit> . bck <dig> overexpression can also suppress the cell lysis defects seen when the kinases mpk <dig> and pck <dig> are deleted  <cit> . msg <dig> encodes a protein phosphatase involved in cell cycle control through the dephosphorylation of mapk and is required for restricting signaling by the cell integrity pathway in yeast  <cit> . the inhibition of mapk signaling leads to inhibition of cell differentiation and cell division  <cit> . the functions of arl <dig> and erg <dig> and their potential roles in chitosan resistance are described in more detail in the discussion.

the fitness of all overexpressing strains compared to an empty vector control and the corresponding heterozygous deletion strains were assessed. in the presence of cos- <dig> , the overexpressing strains always grew better than the vector control  and the corresponding deletion strain demonstrated reduced fitness . in the absence of the cos- <dig> , no growth differences were observed among each overexpressing strain or deletion strains  compared with the vector control, indicating the absence of inherent fitness defects .

transcriptional response to cos
to identify the transcriptional changes caused by exposure to cos- <dig> , wild type  cells, were exposed to cos for 1 h, total rna extracted, and a microarray analysis was performed. a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in response to cos- <dig>  .

a gsea was performed for the entire transcription data set and among the up-regulated transcripts, we identified cellular respiration, atp production, protein complex biogenesis, and mitochondria translation and organization as enriched biological processes . for the down-regulated transcripts, the enriched terms included glycosylation, transmembrane transport, and sterol and lipid biosynthesis. for the overexpressing strains that provided resistance to cos , the majority of these biological processes had the opposite characteristic . a comparison of the transcriptional profiles of the cos- <dig>  treated wild type cells in this study with the chitosan treated 60 min profile from another similar study,  <cit>  was performed . as might be expected, there was considerable overlap among enriched biological processes between the two studies , and included such terms as cell wall organization, atp production, and oxidative phosphorylation as being enriched among up-regulated transcripts. ribosome biogenesis and polyphosphate metabolic processes were enriched among down-regulated transcripts. there were also several biological processes that showed up as having opposite enrichments in the two studies. for example, sterol/ergosterol/lipid biosynthesis was observed as a down-regulated process in our study while these were up-regulated in zakrzewska and co-workers study. while it is not clear why some processes show opposite enrichments in the two studies, we do know that different types and amounts of anti-fungal agents were used, zakrzewska et al. exposed the yeast cells to fragmented chitosan at an ic <dig> -  <dig> and in this study, cells were exposed to cos- <dig>  at an ic <dig> –  <dig> 

transcriptome analysis of the cos- <dig>  resistant strains
to gain a further understanding on the mode of action and mechanisms of resistance to cos, we performed a transcriptome analysis of the  <dig> overexpressing strains known to increase resistance to cos- <dig>  . each overexpressing strain and the wild type  were treated with cos- <dig>  for  <dig> h or mock treated with vehicle alone and rna was isolated from each sample. the rna was converted to labeled cdna and hybridized to nimblegen expression microarrays . we performed two sets of analyses. the first analysis was designed to find genes differentially expressed genes in each overexpression strain compared to wild type in the absence of cos in order to see if overexpression of the gene in question changed the transcriptional profile . the second analysis was designed to find differentially expressed genes in each overexpression strain compared to wild type in the presence of cos to see if the overexpression strains responded differently to cos than wild type.

in the first analysis, we identified  <dig> genes with differential expression in at least one of the  <dig> overexpressing strains compared with the wild type  without cos- <dig>  treatment . each of the  <dig> overexpressing strains showed increased expression of the gene contained in the transformation vector . there was a subset of  <dig> highly up-regulated genes in the arl <dig> and rba <dig> strains  including genes encoding heat shock proteins, acid phosphatases, inorganic phosphatases, and transmembrane transporters. several genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolic processes and biosynthesis, and mitochondrial atp synthesis and electron transport were up-regulated .

transcriptome analysis following cos- <dig>  treatment was performed and  <dig> genes  showed significant differential expression relative to the wild type under the same growth conditions  in at least one of the  <dig> overexpressing strains . significantly over represented biological processes identified by enrichment analyses  <cit>  in the  <dig> differentially up-regulated genes included transcription, cell cycle, protein modification, stress response and ras signal transduction . down-regulated genes were enriched for biological processes included protein folding, protein complex assembly, and respiratory chain complex genes .

the primary biological processes associated with the  <dig> overexpression strains in the presence of cos  were: membrane signalling functions , transcription  and ergosterol synthesis . to gain insight into the potential mechanisms of cos resistance for each overexpressed gene, enrichment maps were constructed from the entire transcription data set, gsea analyzed, for each of the cos treated overexpressed strains . genes that were down-regulated to various degrees in all  <dig> strains were associated with processes such as cell energy generation  and associated by-products . most overexpressing strains  displayed up-regulated genes involved in cell cycle progression  and transcription. taken together these results suggest that the overexpression resistant strains had an overall reduction in energy production and an increase in cell proliferation in response to cos- <dig>  perturbation compared to wild type cells.

we confirmed some of the global transcriptional changes by qrt-pcr. arl <dig> overexpression was confirmed in arl <dig> overexpressing strains. for all of the genes selected, the qrt-pcr results were always in the same direction as the microarray results  but the dynamic range for the transcript changes was greater in the qrt-pcr assays. cos- <dig>  treatment increased levels of expression in the arl <dig> overexpressing strain for fig <dig>  muc <dig>  vba <dig> and yju <dig> with the qrt-pcr transcript levels being  <dig> - 200% higher when compared with the microarray data. decreased transcript levels were confirmed for cmd <dig>  cox5b, hsp <dig>  rcr <dig> and ubi <dig>  using qrt-pcr .

arl <dig> overexpression reduces cos-induced membrane permeabilization
a sytox permeability assay was performed in the wild type  and arl <dig> strain after overnight growth in ypd with cos- <dig>  to assess cell membrane permeability  <cit>  see methods. sytox green fluoresces once bound to nucleic acids. it only enters cells with compromised plasma membranes and is excluded from live cells with an intact plasma membrane. wild type cells treated with cos- <dig>  were sytox-positive indicating that cos treatment causes membrane permeability . there was a dose dependent increase in the intracellular sytox fluorescence signal as a function of cos concentration . although there was some sytox signal in the arl <dig> overexpressing strain, it was significantly lower than that in the wild type at the highest concentration of cos tested  . this indicates that overexpression of arl <dig> provides protection against cos-induced cell permeability and damage.

yeast stress responses and cos- <dig>  resistance
given our observation that the transcriptional changes in the overexpressing strains include genes involved in stress responses, we investigated whether these strains had activated well known stress responses that could potentially account for the strain’s resistance to cos- <dig>  treatment. to test this hypothesis, the wild type strain  was exposed to a sub-lethal dose of different primary stresses previously reported by berry and gasch  <dig>   <cit>  followed by exposure to acute stress.

the wild type strain was first exposed to sub-lethal doses of stress  followed by  <dig> h exposure to cos- <dig>  . the primary mild stresses tested were:  <dig>  m and  <dig>  m nacl, 1 m sorbitol,  <dig> % and  <dig> % h2o <dig> for 60 min, 37°c for 15 min and 30°c control .

wild type cells did not acquire resistance to cos- <dig>  treatment after exposure to sub-lethal doses of different primary stressors , although there was some variation in how the different primary stressors affected yeast growth when challenged with cos- <dig> . in the 30°c control treatments, there was a similar amount of growth in both the control medium  and vehicle ; however, when cos- <dig>  treatment was applied, we observed growth inhibition . after stressing the wild type cells for  <dig> min at 37°c, they could withstand  <dig>  μg/ml of cos- <dig>  and had a similar growth rate as wild type cells, but increasing cos concentrations dramatically inhibited growth rates . when the highest concentration of nacl  was used as the primary stress, the effect of  <dig>  μg/ml of cos- <dig>  was increased, similar to what was observed when stressing cells for  <dig> min at 37°c . the addition of h2o <dig> slowed growth of the wild type cells and h2o <dig> pre-treatment did not appear to provide resistance to cos- <dig>  .

in contrast with the other stressors, sorbitol  stress decreased growth in both untreated and cos- <dig>  challenged cells . it should be noted that sorbitol primary stress does appear to provide some protection against the higher concentrations of cos with cells growing as well in the higher as the lower concentrations of cos, a property not observed for the other stressors. the osmotic stress generated by sorbitol treatment is known to activate other pathways such as mapk and hog cascades  <cit>  and our results show that sorbitol pre-treatment provides some protection against cos  <cit> . the sorbitol results are consistent with the findings of zakrzewska et al.  <dig>   <cit>  who found that when hog pathway mutants and wild type cells, were exposed to 1 m sorbitol, partial protection against chitosan was observed. overall, these results suggest that the cos- <dig>  stress response is different from the previously described environmental stress responses and as a result, most pre-stresses do not confer resistance to cos.

arl <dig> resistance to other antifungal compounds or stresses
to test whether overexpression of arl <dig> confers resistance to other antifungal agents, cationic compounds, or osmotic stresses, wild type  and arl <dig> overexpression strain cells were grown in the presence of these perturbations. overexpression of arl <dig> did not confer resistance to nacl, sorbitol or licl compared with the vector control . overexpression of arl <dig> does confer resistance to cos- <dig>  at high concentrations  where the vector control is unable to grow . interestingly, the arl <dig> overexpression strain is as sensitive to amphotericin b  and terbinafine ,  <dig> and 4 μg/ml, figure 7e and f) as the wild type cells. the arl <dig> overexpression strain appears to be slightly more sensitive than the vector control to fluconazole   <dig> and 20 μg/ml, figures 7c and d). these results suggest that the resistance to cos resulting from arl <dig> overexpression is specific and does not extend to other antifungal compounds that disrupt fungal cell membranes  <cit> . overexpression of arl <dig> allows cells to withstand h2o <dig> perturbation slightly better  than control cells suggesting that arl <dig> overexpression may be providing some protection against oxidative stress .

synergistic interaction of cos- <dig>  with fluconazole
because cos- <dig>  and fluconazole have different modes of action, we examined the effect of treating cells with both compounds simultaneously to test if these two compounds might interact synergistically. we quantified the degree of interaction across different concentrations in a dose response matrix for each drug interacting with itself and with the other drug . at concentrations where either drug only weakly inhibits cells growth  when used in combination, a dramatic decrease in cell growth is observed . using the area under the growth curve as a metric, the combination of cos- <dig>  and fluconazole act in a synergistic fashion since the combination of both drugs inhibits growth much more  than the sum of growth inhibition caused by each compound individually.

discussion
we have applied multiple comprehensive chemogenomics assays in yeast to identify the gene targets of cos- <dig> . unlike other antifungal drugs tested with the same approach  <cit>  where typically 3– <dig> genes are identified as potential drug targets, we found a much larger gene set  of yeast deletion strains highly sensitive to cos- <dig> . the most sensitive heterozygous deletion strain in the pool will often be the drug target  <cit> . in our case, we identified  <dig> heterozygous deletion strains, suggesting that cos does not target a single specific protein as its antifungal mode of action. in a previous global fitness assay similar to the hip-hop assay,  <dig> homozygous strains were sensitive after 9 h  of exposure to 25 μg/ml of 10 kda chitosan. very few heterozygous strains were identified as sensitive to chitosan  <cit> . the differences seen in our results compared to those of zakrzewska et al.  <cit>  are likely due to a number of different experimental parameters. first, there were differences in the form and concentration of cos used, . as we described earlier, the physiochemical properties of cos such as degree of deacetylation and molecular weight are known to affect cos’s biological activity  <cit> . second, the treatment period used in the zakrzewska et al. study was shorter than in the one used in our study . the shorter exposure time could explain the low number of chitosan sensitive heterozygous deletion strains found by these authors since the subtle phenotypes of the heterozygous deletions strains often require longer growth periods to resolve fitness differences between strains  <cit> . finally, the lower threshold for the identification of sensitive strains  used by zakrzewska et al.  <dig>   <cit>  accounts for the higher number of homozygous strains they determined to be chitosan sensitive.

several of the genes sensitive to cos in our hip-hop assay and resistant in the multicopy suppression assay were enriched for proteins targeted to membranes. this is not surprising given that cos likely perturbs membrane integrity. cos might also be creating oxidative stress leading to the accumulation of damaged proteins that are degraded by the proteosome. protein degradation/proteosome functions were among the biological processes enriched in the hip-hop assays .

we selected  <dig> of the confirmed overexpressing strains that provide resistance to cos to uncover any changes in their gene expression profiles that might give insights into cos’s mechanism of action. arl <dig>  was found to be sensitive to cos as a deletion strain in the hop assay and resistant in the msp assay in this study and was found to be sensitive to chitosan as a homozygous deletion strain in a previous study  <cit> . we confirmed that an arl <dig> deletion strain was sensitive to cos- <dig>  and overexpression of arl <dig> conferred resistance to cos- <dig>  . we believe the identification of this gene does provide information into the molecular mechanism of cos- <dig> . arl <dig> is a g protein and soluble gtpase and is a member of the ras superfamily  <cit> . arl <dig> is highly conserved in all eukaryotes with 65% homology to human adp-ribosylation factor-like protein  <dig> . arl <dig> has been shown to be associated with the trans-golgi and is thought to be required for endosome-golgi trafficking  <cit> . arl1-gtp recruits specific receptor proteins to the membrane surface by binding to their grip domains, although in yeast, no specific arl <dig> binding receptor proteins have yet been identified  <cit> . mutations in yeast arl <dig> are not lethal  <cit>  but arl <dig> mutants do show mild defects in localizing proteins to vacuoles as well as defects in potassium uptake  <cit> . arl <dig> mutants have also been shown to be more sensitive to antifungal agents such as hygromycin b  <cit> . arl <dig> can be myristolayted and we hypothesize that through myristoylation, the soluble form of the gtpase could be bound to the membrane bilayer. in this way arl <dig> could act as a sensor and modulate membrane trafficking at the onset of cos  <dig>  induced membrane permeabilization . arl <dig>  has been predicted to weakly associate with membranes  with the n-terminal residues  of each dimer binding to the membrane  <cit> . gtpases are known to be involved in signal transduction pathways in filamentous fungi and yeast. these proteins are also involved in conidiation, a process that is enhanced by chitosan treatment in filamentous fungi  <cit> . when the arl <dig> gene is overexpressed and yeast cells are challenged with cos, a large set of genes related to cytoskeleton organisation  and stress sensing are up-regulated . these genes are also involved in cell division  and the cell cycle. this could explain the ability of chitosan to enhance sporulation  <cit>  .

erg <dig>  which encodes c- <dig> sterol reductase, is a gene involved in ergosterol biosynthesis. because ergosterol is a unique lipid in fungal membranes it is a classical target of many antifungal compounds. in a previous study, while ergosterol content was not associated with resistance to chitosan, in some filamentous fungi saturation of free fatty acids was associated with resistance  <cit> . free fatty acid desaturases lower membrane fluidity and desaturase mutants have been found to confer resistance to chitosan in n. crassa <cit> . membrane patches rich in ergosterol and other lipids alter membrane fluidity and are important for correct membrane function  <cit> . it also has been shown that an increase in sterol biosynthetic capacity results in an increase in the availability of fatty acids  <cit> . we can envision that overexpression of erg <dig>  a key gene in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway, could increase the size/presence of ergosterol rich membrane rafts and fatty acid content making the membrane less fluid and therefore more resistant to cos.

for both yeast and filamentous fungi, the plasma membrane is the primary target for chitosan. in yeast, chitosan causes cell leakage and stops cell growth  <cit> . in filamentous fungi, chitosan permeabilizes the membrane in an energy dependent manner and kills cells of sensitive species such as n. crassa conidia  <cit> . a recent study by palma-guerrero et al.  <dig>   <cit>  found that membrane fluidity is a key factor in the antifungal action of chitosan with fluid fungal membranes binding more chitosan than less fluid ones. chitosan crosses the fungal cell wall and binds to membrane lipids with a preference for negatively charged ones  <cit> . chitosan permeabilizes the membrane when the concentration reaches a critical level  <cit> . our study identifies pathways involved in membrane structure and signalling that are affected by cos. the sytox uptake experiments confirm that membrane permeability is increased when cells are exposed to cos and that overexpression of arl <dig> suppresses the increase in membrane permeability caused by cos .

while our work and previous studies have shown that chitosan induces stress responses in yeast and other fungi, our study shows that pre-treatment with any of the well characterized environmental stresses  does not provide resistance to cos- <dig>  in yeast . therefore, the changes induced by cos would appear to be different from previously described environmental stress response pathways.

assuming that cos’s main mode of anti-fungal action is to increase the permeabilization of membranes, we speculate that several of the genes we have identified in this study are involved in a cellular response that reduces permeabilization of the membrane and/or mitigates the damage induced by the permeabilization. for example, arl <dig>  bck <dig> and msg <dig> could be part of a sensing and signalling mechanism that detects cos binding to the membrane that induces transcriptional and other changes to reduce membrane permeability. erg <dig> could be reducing membrane permeability by affecting the composition and fluidity of the membrane . ultimately, if cos concentrations are too high, the cellular response would be insufficient to prevent membrane permeabilization and cell death would ensue - possibly as a result of the release/leakage of oxygen radicals from the mitochondria. while the exact mechanism of cell death by cos is still unknown, it appears to be a respiration/atp-dependent process in filamentous fungi  <cit> . overexpressing strains resistant to cos display down-regulated genes related to energy dependent processes  . in this sense, the overexpressing strains would mimic the effect of treatments such as sodium azide and low temperature that inhibit oxidative respiration and chitosan damage to fungal cells  <cit> . interestingly, the arl <dig> overexpression strain also shows increased resistance to certain forms of oxidative stress such as h2o <dig> . the transcriptome analysis of several of the overexpressing strains suggests that resistance to cos involves generation of less ros by reducing oxidative respiration as well as reducing cell responses to ros.

a comparison of the gene targets found in the hip-hop screens in this study to genes found in similar screens for other fungicides that act at the cell membrane  suggests that cos may have a different mechanism of action than these other drugs  <cit> . in support of this hypothesis, we have found that the arl <dig> overexpression strain does not provide resistance against amphotericin b, fluconazole or terbinafine . this suggests that cos might be an effective antifungal agent in strains that are resistant to the other perturbing cell membrane compounds.

fluconazole, terbinafine and amphotericin b antifungal activity involves the targeting of ergosterol, the principal cell membrane sterol of fungi, by different mechanisms. fluconazole  inhibits 14α-demethylase , a fungal cytochrome p <dig> dependent enzyme, and depletes cell membrane ergosterol resulting in reduced membrane fluidity, and the accumulation of 14α-demethylated sterols that are toxic to the cell. this leads to growth arrest and eventual fungal cell death  <cit> . terbinafine inhibits squalene monoxygenase , an enzyme responsible for conversion of squalene epoxide, a precursor to lanosterol in the ergosterol synthesis pathway  <cit> . amphotericin b targets the fungal cell membrane by directly binding to ergosterol, forming complexes that intercalate the cell membrane, resulting in formation of pores and leakage of intracellular contents  <cit> . cos appears to perturb the cell membrane possibly through the ergosterol pathway, by targeting erg <dig>  a gene that encodes for c- <dig> sterol reductase  <cit> .

because cos seems to have a distinct mode of action compared with other antifungals, we were interested in seeing its inhibitory effect when used in conjunction with another antifungal drug. we tested cos and fluconazole in combination , and saw a strong synergism between them. that is, at concentrations where either drug alone had little inhibitory effect, a strong inhibitory effect that was much greater than additive was observed when they were combined . one possible explanation for this synergy might be that the increased membrane permeability induced by cos allows more fluconazole to penetrate the cell membrane to inhibit 14α-demethylase that in turn further reduces membrane fluidity and increases the production of toxic sterols.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study have provided insights into the molecular mechanisms of the antifungal modes of action of cos. some of the pathways cos appears to affect include sensing, signalling, and the composition of the cell membrane . our results suggest that cos does not have a single specific gene target. we provide evidence that cos increases cell membrane permeability and that the overexpression of arl <dig> can reduce the permeability induced by cos. resistance to cos does not confer resistance to other antifungal compounds that disrupt the fungal cell membrane such as azoles, polyenes and terbinafine. cos can synergize with other antifungal agents such as fluconazole suggesting that cos could be considered as alternative antifungal treatment to fungal pathogens that are resistant to other antifungal compounds or be used in combination with other antifungal agents to enhance their activity.
