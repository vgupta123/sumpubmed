BACKGROUND
symbiotic interactions between species can range from mutualistic to parasitic, depending on the levels of cooperation and conflict expressed between the interactors  <cit> . rarely is the association limited to just two species, so understanding interaction networks is paramount for accurate interpretation of ecologically and clinically important assemblies of organisms e.g.  <cit> . the complex mutualism of the fungus-growing ants has become a model for testing the mechanisms of multi-partite interaction stability and specificity e.g.  <cit> . the ants farm fungal cultivars in clonal monocultures  <cit>  and have achieved substantial evolutionary radiation since the symbiosis evolved ca.  <dig> million years ago  <cit> .

over evolutionary time, a number of other organisms have become associated with the symbiosis, as commensals  <cit> , parasites, additional mutualists, or parasites of additional mutualists  <cit> . in particular, studies have focused on the hypocrealean fungal genus escovopsis, which are specialized ascomycete parasites of the attine cultivars  <cit> . while devastating if uncontrolled, many attine ants harbor antibiotic-producing actinomycete bacteria on their cuticle to protect their gardens with a range of associated behaviors  <cit> , but the association specificity between these bacteria, the ants that carry them, and the pathogens they target has been subject to debate  <cit> .

atta and acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants are the most evolutionarily derived fungus-growing ants. both genera harvest fresh plant material to provision their fungus gardens, but only acromyrmex has maintained the ancestral attine habit of growing filamentous actinomycete bacteria on the cuticle of large- and medium-sized workers  <cit> . the bacterial cover may have multiple functions; it has been shown to provide a barrier against entomopathogens for newly eclosed  workers  <cit>  but experimental work has primarily focused on its role in defending gardens against escovopsis during the first weeks of callow life, when cuticular actinomycete cover is high and ant behavior is focused on fungus garden maintenance  <cit> . in the two best studied species, a. echinatior and a. octospinosus, pseudonocardia bacteria have been shown to dominate cuticular communities with both non-specific  <dig> 16s rdna amplification and culture-based approaches  <cit> . the bacterial cover of large workers follows a characteristic ontogenetic pattern starting with inoculation shortly after eclosion  <cit> , culminating with substantial body cover after two to three weeks, and declining to a modest cover by the time workers become foragers about seven weeks after eclosing.

the initial exponential growth phase towards full cuticular actinomycete cover has been suggested to be supported by nutrients on the ant cuticle and metapleural gland secretions  <cit> , whereas the propleural plates of large workers maintain actinomycete cultures much longer, likely using secretions from specific sub-cuticular glands  <cit> . acromyrmex colonies have been observed to induce bacterial growth when faced with an experimental escovopsis challenge  <cit> , but the extent to which the host can control bacterial growth, how this may be achieved and whether the performed grooming behaviors depend on the host/symbiont match is not well understood. answering these questions is therefore important for evaluating the specificity and coevolutionary potential of this mutualistic interaction, which may represent the oldest example of biological control of crop-pests.

the a. echinatior population in gamboa, panama is well studied, with two phylotypes of pseudonocardia known to be present and colonies maintaining their original phylotype for more than ten years after transfer to the laboratory  <cit> . we use the term “phylotype” after identifying the pseudonocardia symbionts by partial sequencing of the 16s rdna and ef-1α genes  <cit> . however, while the default transmission route of pseudonocardia is vertical, both across generations of colonies and among workers within colonies  <cit> , other actinomycetes than pseudonocardia have also been isolated, both from acromyrmex and other attine ants, suggesting that additional environmental acquisition is common  <cit> . a recent hypothesis proposed by scheuring & yu  <cit>  suggests that such diversity may be stable if the initial cuticular community is dominated by a single mutualistic actinomycete phylotype, which would be the case when native vertically transmitted phylotypes are the first to colonize ants after they eclose, consistent with recent 16s rdna amplicon sequencing results  <cit> .

the aim of the present study was to test whether interaction-specificity of acromyrmex and pseudonocardia bacteria varies among sympatric colonies maintaining different vertically transmitted phylotypes. we designed a cross-fostering experiment to manipulate the first inoculations of eclosing large workers and to monitor the consequences of pseudonocardia swaps for the expression of prophylactic behavioral responses by the ants after infection with escovopsis. when ant pupae are cross-fostered in a different colony than their own, the callow adults that eclose from them readily obtain a bacterial cover, but a previous study indicated that cross-inoculated bacteria reach lower abundance on mature ants three weeks later than they would have on ants reared in their native colony  <cit> . this suggested that there is some degree of specificity in the association between acromyrmex host colonies and phylotypes of actinomycete symbionts. such specificity would be consistent with co-adaptation between acromyrmex hosts and actinomycete symbionts within a specific population of ant colonies, whereas recent debate has primarily addressed the dynamics of the attine ant-pseudonocardia mutualism at the species level  <cit> .

we used four a. echinatior source colonies, each harboring one of the two previously identified pseudonocardia phylotypes ps <dig> and ps <dig>  <cit> , to create a fully crossed experimental design of subcolonies where pupae of large workers were raised in an environment with either their own pseudonocardia phylotype or the other phylotype . the bacterial growth rates on the ant cuticles were measured to test whether interaction-specificity constrains bacterial inoculations that are not strictly vertical. in addition, we monitored behavioral reactions of the ants after controlled exposure to escovopsis to test whether horizontally acquired phylotypes would affect prophylactic disease defense behaviors and thus potentially the survival and reproductive success of the ants and their fungus gardens, even though the swapped pseudonocardia phylotypes are native mutualists in other sympatric colonies of the same host ant species. superior symbiont growth or enhanced behavioral defenses against escovopsis in the presence of a native bacterial symbiont would suggest that ant- and bacterial lineages co-adapt in spite of substantial gene-flow across ant generations, whereas not finding such patterns would be evidence for the absence of variation in interaction-specificity, and thus for much lower potential for co-adaptive evolutionary change.figure  <dig>

our results confirm earlier observations that eclosing callow workers can be successfully inoculated by genetically different pseudonocardia phylotypes from sympatric conspecific colonies, and we found no evidence for differences in host/symbiont specificity at this stage. however, we found consistent differences in final cover across actinomycete phylotypes and, after infecting experimental subcolonies with escovopsis, multiple differences in ant grooming behavior depending on whether they were associated with one or the other pseudonocardia phylotype.

RESULTS
differential growth rates of pseudonocardia phylotypes on cross-fostered workers
we confirmed by pcr that the ants after eclosion readily obtained the pseudonocardia phylotype of the fungus garden and the nursing workers they were exposed to, and that both phylotypes showed exponential growth on the ant cuticles during the two weeks following inoculation with no effect of the cross-fostering . however, ants from one colony  and some of the combinations of pupae and garden/nurses reached maximum bacterial cover faster than others, consistent with earlier findings . our results thus indicate that there were intrinsic differences between colonies in bacterial growth rate, but that these conditions by themselves were not inducing exclusive forms of acromyrmex-pseudonocardia interaction specificity. a relatively high overall variation in cuticular pseudonocardia-cover between individual ants suggests that uncontrolled factors also affect bacterial growth, such as the bacterial cover of inoculating ants in the fungus garden, potentially including taxa other than pseudonocardia for older workers, and differences in the extent to which standardized laboratory provisioning of colonies may affect genetically different ants and fungus gardens. the fact that acromyrmex pupae are variably covered in hyphae of the garden fungus prior to eclosion  <cit>  might also have affected the conditions for subsequent bacterial growth after eclosing.figure  <dig>

a previous study  <cit>  showed that there was a significant effect of source colony id and cross-fostering on the final bacterial cover of mature a. echinatior workers from colonies of the same panamanian population, which normally have regressed to a coverage score of  <dig> or  <dig>  by the time they become foragers  <cit> . the effect was subtle but significant because of the large sample size of > <dig> ants, but with only two source colonies it was not possible to infer whether this effect was colony- or pseudonocardia-phylotype-specific. our present results confirm by pcr that the colonies used by armitage et al.  <cit>  harbored different phylotypes, ps <dig> in ae. <dig> and ps <dig> in ae. <dig>  so the results of both studies indicate that cross fostered pupae from a ps <dig> colony ended up as mature workers with lower covers when they were inoculated with ps <dig>  whereas the reduction of ps <dig> workers inoculated with ps <dig> was much less pronounced  χ2 =  <dig> , df =  <dig>  p =  <dig> ; phylotype pupae × phylotype garden: l-r χ2 =  <dig> , df =  <dig>  p =  <dig> ; figure 3f, additional file 1: table s2). we also found significant effects of pupal origin and garden colony id, with pupae and gardens from ae. <dig>  supporting lower final covers than gardens from ae. <dig> . our estimates of final actinomycete-cover were somewhat higher  than in armitage et al.  <cit> , consistent with our ants not quite having reached their final low cover typical of foragers by the time we terminated our experiment . armitage et al. also found that ps <dig> ants maintain a higher cover than ps <dig> ants as they develop towards becoming foragers .figure  <dig>

the combined results from both studies thus support the idea that there are pseudonocardia phylotype-specific effects on the final bacterial cover of large acromyrmex workers, with one of the phylotypes maintaining a higher cover when grown on its native host, consistent with some degree of co-adaptation and host-specificity, potentially mediated by secretions from the subcuticular glands under the propleural plates  <cit> . the results recently obtained by andersen et al.  <cit>  showed that older  workers from ps <dig> colonies acquire a more diverse cuticular community , whereas older workers from ps <dig> colonies retain their monocultures almost unchanged. whether these novel acquisitions grow in competition with ps <dig> remains to be confirmed but their relative abundances as documented by andersen et al.  <cit>  indicated that this was likely the case. however, the extent and diversity of the bacterial cover for workers that have reached the foraging stage is unlikely to be of importance in fungus garden disease-defense and transmission of pseudonocardia to newly eclosed workers  <cit> , as these foragers are no longer nurses.

behavioral changes induced by cross-fostering
our cross-fostering approach allowed us to explicitly analyze whether subtle forms of co-adaptation between ant host colonies and their pseudonocardia symbionts are likely to have shaped prophylactic behavior following escovopsis exposure. as we detail below, the ps <dig> and ps <dig> phylotypes, which occur in ca. 50/ <dig> monocultures across the a. echinatior population in gamboa  <cit>  appear to have co-adapted to some extent to the maternal ant lineages that maintain them by vertical transmission, in spite of panmictic gene flow via the multiple males that inseminate queens every generation. one of the four behavioral profiles that we describe below is significantly different between workers with different native pupal pseudonocardia phylotypes, and one behavioral profile and the time spent outside the fungus garden are significantly different for ants with different combinations of native pupal phylotype and the phylotype of the colony into which they were introduced.

callow workers with extensive bacterial cover have been suggested to be particularly important for defense against escovopsis in the fungus garden  <cit> . vectoring the bacterial antibiotics towards their disease targets should be closely connected to the expression of adequate grooming and weeding behaviors known to be important for the successful control of escovopsis infections  <cit> . large callow acromyrmex workers with a full pseudonocardia cover have been found to often sit in the lower parts of fungus gardens, where infection problems with escovopsis are most likely to occur  <cit> . on average 80% of the behaviors that we observed were performed in the fungus garden and we summarize here only the significant main effects and interaction terms, referring the reader to additional file 1: table s3- <dig> for a complete overview. self- and fungus-grooming dominated among the garden behaviors, consistent with callow workers having exclusive indoor tasks, and fungus-grooming being particularly positively correlated with bacterial cover . in all instances, fungus-grooming preceded garden-weeding , but only the frequency of garden-weeding decreased significantly over the three days of our experiment , suggesting that this particular behavior  reduces the acute escovopsis threat, whereas fungus-grooming and allo-grooming  represent ongoing routine maintenance of fungus gardens.figure  <dig>

infection of their gardens, presented as mean proportions of time spent on each behavior ± se. plots are organized according to fostering treatments with garden phylotype followed by pupal phylotype  and time since colonies were infected on day  <dig> . self-grooming, fungus-grooming and allo-grooming were the most common behaviors, whereas garden-weeding was mainly observed on the day of infection  and decreased significantly over the three days.



of the nine ant behaviors recorded in infected fungus gardens, the ants spent most of their time self-grooming and fungus-grooming. self-grooming was performed less by ants with a non-native symbiont, particularly ps <dig> ants receiving a cross fostered inoculation with ps <dig> , although this did not retain significance after bonferroni correction . if self-grooming serves a function in the maintenance of cuticular bacteria, this is consistent with ants that were forced to work with a non-native pseudonocardia phylotype being less motivated to protect their cuticular actinomycetes against secondary invaders, particularly when the new phylotype  was more robust against such secondary invasions  <cit> . we also found that native-ps <dig> workers groomed their gardens less frequently . in contrast, allo-grooming of sisters by native-ps <dig> workers occurred at a higher rate than allo-grooming by ps <dig> workers . there were no significant differences between phylotypes or their combinations for pc <dig>  representing garden-weeding .

finally, there was an increase in the proportion of time the workers spent outside the fungus garden over the three days following escovopsis infection . relative to native-ps <dig> workers, native-ps <dig> workers spent more time outside their gardens , especially when tending a ps <dig> garden . we note, however, that the degree to which escovopsis control was ultimately successful could not be estimated in our experiments, so that detailed interpretations of our results will need further validation.

CONCLUSIONS
around the turn of the century, the recognition of escovopsis as an omnipresent fungus garden parasite and the discovery of cuticular pseudonocardia actinomycetes as obligate defensive symbionts fundamentally changed our interpretation of the complexity of the attine fungus-growing ant symbiosis  <cit> . later work underlined the broad-scale adaptive nature of the pseudonocardia cuticular symbiosis across the attine phylogenetic tree  <cit> , until coevolutionary interpretations started to attract criticism  <cit> , because attine cuticular actinomycetes were shown to be often taxonomically diverse  <cit> , did not always  inhibit escovopsis  <cit> , and could be environmentally acquired  <cit> , while still producing antibiotics when growing on the cuticles of attine ants  <cit> . however, our present study and andersen et al.  <cit>  suggest that scenarios of co-adaptation between pseudonocardia and specific lineages of acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants are valid in acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants.

our results and those by poulsen et al.  <cit>  and armitage et al.  <cit>  show that different pseudonocardia phylotypes can readily colonize the cuticle of callow large workers of acromymex ants, and we found no indications of any specific host-symbiont recognition or discrimination at this stage. however, such discrimination also seems unlikely to have been selected for, because callow ants are inoculated in the fungus garden in which they eclose and with actinomycetes that are long-term associated with the fungus garden and/or their sister workers  <cit> . a recently published study has suggested that the opportunity for colonization may be limited to a time frame of just a few days immediately following eclosion and showing that callow workers were only successfully inoculated when in the company of large sister workers with a full bacterial cover  <cit> . however, sample sizes of that study were very small, so could at best show that likelihoods of inoculation differed, consistent with our present results, which show that callow large workers almost always developed a full bacterial cover in the presence of only small and medium size workers and a fungus garden fragment. together these findings match predictions from the model by scheuring & yu  <cit> , demonstrating that initial colonization with an actinomycete of proven usefulness to the farming symbiosis will guarantee that later secondary acquisitions will not challenge the mutualistic nature of the entire cuticular biofilm, consistent with old foragers of a. echinatior never completely losing their native symbiont even though their cuticular biofilm may become dominated by other actinobacteria later in life  <cit> .

our present study indicates that evolutionary processes of mutual co-adaptation between female lineages of leaf-cutting ant hosts and phylotypes of cuticular pseudonocardia may operate at the within-population level. a promising line of future research may therefore be to investigate whether the ps <dig> and ps <dig> phylotypes of a. echinatior in gamboa may associate with maternally inherited fungus garden clones and even ant mitochondrial genotypes, and to extend such approaches to sympatric populations of other fungus-growing ants to see whether common patterns of inheritance and lineage sorting may emerge. the different behavioral syndromes of the ant hosts in response to their gardens being challenged with the same escovopsis strain suggests that there may be different ways of being a successful native pseudonocardia symbiont of panamanian a. echinatior, resulting in a mixed evolutionary stable strategy  <cit>  consistent with the ca. 50/ <dig> prevalence of the two phylotypes in the population as a whole.

it will be important to do similar studies with other sympatric escovopsis strains to test the generality of the ps1- and ps2-induced defensive behaviors, and to investigate the efficiencies by which ps <dig> and ps <dig> can control escovopsis infections in combination with the behavioral syndromes of their host ants, as that will ultimately determine whether and how these phylotypes stably coexist in the same population while excluding each other at the level of host colonies. future studies will also need to study the chemical compounds by which ant colonies, ps <dig>  and ps <dig> interact. our present results indicate that such studies should retain focus on individual and colony-level variation rather than dismissing co-evolutionary adaptations on the basis of species-level studies only.
