BACKGROUND
advances in the field of synthetic biology have enabled the design of engineered cells performing human-defined functions at a single cell resolution
 <cit> . these functions include but are not limited to oscillators
 <cit> , bistable switches
 <cit> , bio-logical gates
 <cit> , riboregulators
 <cit>  and molecular devices that control gene expression
 <cit> . despite this progress, several limitations still exist. a major shortcoming is the decreased robustness and the limited potential complexity of single cell functions. thus, attention has been shifted to synthetic systems based on communication between cells, rather than individual isolated cell functionality. cooperation among cells is largely mediated by quorum sensing
 <cit>  and may be promising for the development of cell-systems that robustly perform complex tasks
 <cit> . these tasks range from cells rescuing or killing one another
 <cit>  to cells synchronizing across a relatively long distance
 <cit> .

the potential advantage of microbial consortia compared to monocultures is two-fold. first, in contrast to monocultures, multicultures allow the different species to share the various required synthetic functions or the different steps of a synthetic function. this function sharing decreases the burden in the metabolism of the cells significantly. second, the sharing of different functions, or steps, among different cells potentially renders microbial consortia more suited for fine-tuning of their artificial functionality
 <cit> .

it is now clear that mathematical models can accurately capture the behavior of synthetic systems comprising of either bacterial or yeast cell strains and allowing cell-to-cell communication
 <cit> . you and his co-workers designed a synthetic bacterial ecosystem where cell-cell communication controls cell density by inducing a killer gene in the bacteria
 <cit> . to mathematically investigate the dynamics of this system, they coupled their experiments with a simple deterministic model. shou et al. designed a synthetic yeast system where cell growth was dependent on successful cell-cell communication
 <cit> . to further explain their system behavior, they used a mathematical model comprised of algebraic equations. basu and his co-workers designed a synthetic system, composed of bacteria, that forms different patterns of differentiation, such as rings and clovers, driven by cell-cell communication via n-acyl homoserine lactone  signals
 <cit> . in addition to experimentally designing this system, they used a deterministic mathematical model to explore the behavior of this system. balagadde et al. designed a synthetic bacterial ecosystem where cell-cell communication enables cells to exhibit predator-prey dynamics by either killing or rescuing one another
 <cit> . they initially developed a deterministic model to thoroughly study the dynamics of their synthetic ecosystem and then introduced a constant noise term to their model aiming to explore the influence of the stochasticity in their system.

even though communication between different species using non-ahl signals has been demonstrated previously
 <cit> , no synthetic ecosystem has been developed that is composed of bacteria and yeast which communicate with and benefit from each other using ahl signals. such a microbial consortium could exhibit interesting dynamics, such as oscillatory behavior, that stem from the substantial differences  between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. here, we investigate the behavior of such a synthetic heterogeneous community using stochastic modeling. to this end, we have modeled and simulated a synthetic consortium composed of saccharomyces cerevisiae  and escherichia coli  cells. this synthetic ecosystem was found to exhibit intriguing dynamic behavior that is commonly observed in natural ecosystems. our model, capturing the behavior of this ecosystem, has been built in such a way that it can capture the dynamics of any system with two different species communicating with ahl signals. thus, our model may drive the experimental design of artificial ecosystems with two different species  which communicate with and regulate gene expression in one another.

methods
design of the synthetic ecosystem
in this study, we propose the design of a synthetic yeast-bacteria ecosystem that is based on diffusible chemical signals. examples of these signals are the rhii/rhlr and luxi/luxr quorum sensing signals from pseudomonas aeruiginosa and vibrio fisheri quorum sensing systems, respectively, which are known for their sensitivity and the absence of signal cross-reactivity
 <cit> .

each species exists in the presence of a molecule controlling growth, gc. this molecule could be an antibiotic, such as kanamycin, which is effective against both e. coli and s. cerevisiae <cit> . gc inhibits cell growth and therefore each species ultimately goes extinct. however, each species contains a resistance gene which counteracts the function of gc and is controlled by the other species via diffusible molecules. thus, when both species are present, they induce each otherâ€™s resistance gene through chemical signals, thereby rescuing one another. a schematic representation of the proposed ecosystem is illustrated in figure
 <dig> 

more specifically, s. cerevisiae constitutively expresses a diffusible molecule, ahl <dig>  ahl <dig> diffuses out of the s. cerevisiae cells, penetrating e. coli cells and binding to its cognate receptor, ahlr <dig>  ahlr <dig> is constitutively produced in e. coli. the activated molecule in e. coli binds to the responsive element fused upstream of the res promoter activating expression of res. subsequently, the resistance protein, res, deactivates gc in e. coli. potential res could be the kanamycin resistance protein
 <cit> .

the second component of the feedback loop in e. coli functions in the same genetic fashion. it constitutively produces an autoinducer synthase, ahl <dig>  once ahl <dig> is produced, it diffuses out of the e. coli into s. cerevisiae, and is recognized by its cognate receptor, ahlr <dig>  which is constitutively produced in s. cerevisiae as a fusion protein that allows it to be activated in eukaryotic cells. this activated molecule now binds to its responsive promoter and induces expression of the resistance gene, res. the resistance protein, in turn, represses the function of gc in s. cerevisiae.

it is important to note that for the purposes of this study, we assume synthetic bacterial molecular components function in yeast. we hypothesize that their functionality may be retained when they are used in yeast. this is not an unreasonable hypothesis since the functionality of quorum sensing bacterial elements has been demonstrated experimentally in other higher organisms
 <cit> .

here, we aim to computationally explore the behavior of a microbial consortium consisting of two different species, and how the differences of the two species affect its dynamics. the focus is therefore on the population dynamics. the functionality of such an ecosystem could in principle be achieved using any other molecular components with similar function.

model description
as discussed in the previous section, numerous mathematical models that describe the behavior of synthetic ecosystems have been developed previously
 <cit> . the vast majority of these models are deterministic, ignoring the stochastic nature which is ubiquitous in biological systems
 <cit> . thus far, different methods have been described
 <cit>  and extensively applied to stochastically simulate the dynamics of biological systems in general and gene networks in particular
 <cit> .

in this study, we develop a stochastic model that accounts for the intrinsic and extrinsic noise and describes the dynamics of the synthetic bacteria-yeast ecosystem depicted in figure
 <dig>  the model takes into consideration the volume and the growth rate differences between e. coli and s. cerevisiae. in addition, it accounts for the gene expression dissimilarities between bacteria and yeast. our model monitors the evolution of molecular species that usually exist in relatively high amounts allowing for the use of continuous stochastic models
 <cit> . continuous stochastic computational approaches have also accurately described the experimental phenotype of synthetic cell communities
 <cit> . we, therefore, employ chemical langevin equations
 <cit>  to capture the evolution of the species participating in this synthetic ecosystem.

the model consists of  <dig> reactions whose dynamics are described using  <dig> stochastic differential equations . the equations were integrated in matlab using the euler maruyama method
 <cit> . the type of reactions as well as the kinetic parameters used were acquired from previously published studies involving experimental work. our model is generic , but for the purposes of this study we assumed specific molecular components  that have been widely used in designing synthetic ecosystems. these components are presented in table
 <dig>  the current model may capture the behavior of any similar heterogeneous ecosystem by simply modifying the kinetic parameters according to the new system. the reaction network along with the kinetic parameters and the reaction rates capturing the behavior of our system is presented in table
 <dig> 

the first two reactions describe the cell population growth. consistent with previous mathematical models
 <cit> , and because the model refers to ecology, population growth follows logistic kinetics. bacteria were considered to grow four times faster than yeast
 <cit> ; k <dig> was set four times smaller than k <dig>  cmax represents the carrying capacity of the bioreactor, i.e. the maximal population load that the bioreactor can sustain
 <cit> , and is set equal to  <dig> cells
 <cit> . reactions  <dig> and  <dig> represent the cell death due to the presence of gc . we assume a constant concentration of gc  as, according to the kinetic parameters used in our model, this concentration kills each single simulated cell colony when the two species are placed separately. both the bacteria and yeast carry a resistance gene so the reaction rate is written such that the higher the amount of the resistance protein, the slower the cell death rate is. similar reaction rates have been used previously to capture cell death due to killer proteins
 <cit> . the correlation between gc and the resistance protein is tuned through the parameter Î±. the parameter Î± was initially set equal to  <dig> Â·  <dig> moleculesâˆ’ <dig>  due to the lack of literature values, and subsequently the sensitivity of the ecosystemâ€™s behavior to changes in this parameter was investigated. reactions  <dig> and  <dig> describe the production of the molecules responsible for the diffusible signals. ahl <dig> and ahlr <dig> are produced by s. cerevisiae whereas ahl <dig> and ahlr <dig> are produced by e. coli. the concentration of ahlr <dig> and ahlr <dig> is considered constant  and equal to previously published values
 <cit> . ahl <dig> and ahl <dig> production reactions are assumed to be first order, in accordance with previous studies
 <cit> . the production rate of these diffusible molecules can vary significantly depending on the promoter strength of the associated genes. using directed evolution, a wide range of quorum sensing production rates can be achieved
 <cit> . the optimized behavior can be also achieved using computational approaches
 <cit> . in our model, we initially adopted k <dig> and k <dig> from
 <cit>  and subsequently increased their values since our system required very long time to reach steady state under these conditions. reaction  <dig> captures the binding of ahl <dig> to ahlr <dig> in s. cerevisiae. this reaction is considered a fourth order reaction  since it has been demonstrated that a fourth order reaction can capture the experimental phenotypes well
 <cit> . resistance protein  production is calculated using hill type kinetics, in accordance with experimental observations
 <cit> , and is shown in reaction  <dig>  this reaction also accounts for gene expression differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. in contrast to prokaryotes, eukaryotic transcription requires many transcription factors to be recruited before its initiation. moreover, the translation process in prokaryotes is faster than in eukaryotes
 <cit> . these two factors introduce a delay in eukaryotic gene expression rendering it slow compared to the prokaryotic gene expression. in our model, we represent this delay using reaction  <dig>  in fact, we assume that a complex  must first be formed before res production can take place. a similar approach has been used previously to capture transcription in yeast
 <cit> . after performing a set of simulations, we set k <dig> equal to  <dig> hâˆ’ <dig> since this value was found to cause a delay in our ecosystem compared to a model lacking this intermediate reaction . the actual process of protein production is captured by reaction  <dig>  similarly to reaction  <dig>  reaction  <dig> captures the binding of ahl <dig> to ahlr <dig> in e. coli . reaction  <dig> is used to describe e. coli gene expression. note that in this case there is no reaction describing a delay in gene expression. finally, reactions 12- <dig> represent the degradation of the species participating in this network and they are all considered first-order.

RESULTS
testing synthetic ecosystemâ€™s functionality
initially, we explored whether s. cerevisiae cells can withstand gc in the absence of e. coli cells and vice versa. we simulated the behavior of  <dig>  yeast cells and  <dig>  bacterial cells in the absence of gc. our simulations indicated that both s. cerevisiae and e. coli grow normally . however, when each of the two populations is placed in a simulated bioreactor separately, in the presence of gc, neither population is able to survive .

subsequently, we simulated the behavior of bacteria and yeast when both are present to test whether communication and cooperation between these two species can be successfully achieved. we simulated stochastically  <dig> different population colonies containing  <dig>  e. coli and  <dig>  s. cerevisiae cells. the results are depicted in figures
2a  and
2b . the different lines correspond to the cell population size in different trajectories. the evolution of all the species is provided in the additional file
 <dig> 
2b and shows the fluctuations of e. coli population size.

in both cases, the two different species exploit communication with one another for successful survival in the presence of gc. our simulations demonstrate that yeast can successfully induce the expression of the resistance gene found in bacteria and vice versa. this is a common characteristic of ecosystems called obligatory mutualism. in other words, s. cerevisiae and e. coli cells are not able to survive separately but they are able to grow in concert. as expected, we observe that the number of e. coli cells is always higher than the number of s. cerevisiae cells. as discussed before, the reason for this is the high growth rate of bacteria relative to yeast.

variation regarding the number of cells is observed when different colonies are simulated and is attributed to the stochasticity underlying biological functions. the average s. cerevisiae population  is around  <dig> Â·  <dig> cells and the standard deviation is equal to  <dig> Â·  <dig> cells. the mean e. coli population is about  <dig> Â· <dig> cells and the standard deviation is approximately  <dig> Â· <dig> cells. note that the total number of cells cannot exceed  <dig>  both bacteria and yeast require approximately  <dig> hours to reach steady state. in every single bioreactor, neither bacteria nor yeast die from the presence of gc. this demonstrates that communication can take place between s. cerevisiae and e. coli allowing for the survival of the two species.

even though figure
 <dig> establishes cell communication and obligatory mutualism between e. coli and s. cerevisiae cells, this refers only to the case described by this set of parameters. thus, in order to investigate which parameters promote successful communication and cooperation between e. coli and s. cerevisiae cells, and to explore the dynamics of different parameter sets, a sensitivity analysis was performed. to implement this, we systematically modified different parameters within reasonable ranges and monitored the dynamics of the system. in what follows, we present the evolution of the average s. cerevisiae and e. coli population over  <dig> trajectories. in some cases, we further provide all the  <dig> trajectories with variation in the values of key parameters examined in our analysis.

ecosystemâ€™s sensitivity to parameter Î±
as discussed in the previous section, Î±represents a correlation between the molecule controlling growth and the resistance protein. more specifically, the larger the Î±, the smaller the amount of res required for cells to survive from gc . since this parameter is of high importance for our model, and because it was the only parameter not acquired from previously published models, we explored the influence of Î± on the systemâ€™s behavior. to this end, we performed multiple computational experiments modifying Î±and investigating our ecosystemâ€™s dynamic behavior. our simulation results showed that when Î± is larger than  <dig> nmâˆ’ <dig>  the total systemâ€™s behavior does not change appreciably . for values of Î± smaller than  <dig>  nmâˆ’ <dig>  the ecosystem is driven to extinction . importantly, our simulationsâ€™ data demonstrated that for values of Î± in the range of  <dig>  nmâˆ’ <dig> to  <dig> nmâˆ’ <dig>  the dynamics of the system, and specifically the time the system needs to reach steady state, becomes remarkably slow. figures
3a and
3b show the mean values, along with the standard deviation, of  <dig> trajectories from the stochastic simulations for Î± equal to  <dig> nmâˆ’ <dig> ,  <dig> nmâˆ’ <dig> and 5Â·  <dig> nmâˆ’ <dig>  as observed in figure
 <dig>  when the value of Î±is lower than  <dig>  the system cannot reach steady state even after  <dig>  hours. to our knowledge, no synthetic ecosystem exists that reaches steady state after such a long time suggesting that in order for this system to be realistic, the value of Î± in our model should be higher than  <dig> nmâˆ’ <dig>  this is confirmed by the fact that our system reaches steady state approximately as fast as previously published synthetic ecosystems systems did
 <cit> .

importance of gc concentration
previous studies describing similar synthetic ecosystems have demonstrated the importance of the concentration of the molecule controlling growth on the systemâ€™s dynamics
 <cit> . guided by this, we conducted a set of simulations where we modified gcâ€™s concentration. we monitored the dynamics of the system for three different gc concentrations. the average population values  for each concentration are shown in figures
4a and
4b.  <dig> trajectories of the two species population for the different gc concentrations are provided in figures
4c and
4d.

as figure
 <dig> indicates, an increase on gcâ€™s concentration from  <dig> nm to  <dig> nm is followed by a decreased yeast population and an increased bacterial population. in other words, upon increasing gc concentration in the bioreactor, e. coli cells benefit whereas s. cerevisiae cells are harmed. based on the way our model was built, this is likely ascribed to the fact that yeast grow much slower than bacteria and can therefore resist only low gc concentrations. as the antibiotic concentration increases, yeast die faster than bacteria and the latter, even though they grow slower than they would in the absence of gc, take advantage of the higher nutrient levels in the bioreactor. this is an interesting characteristic and could be used as a means for controlling the bioreactorâ€™s population, obviating the need of adding or removing cells. however, when gc concentration is significantly high , the average value  of both populations decreases dramatically as many single trajectories reach zero.

further analysis of the systemâ€™s behavior indicated that changing the gc concentration leads to an intriguing behavior commonly exhibited by natural ecosystems. more specifically, when gc levels are low, each species can survive even in the absence of the other species. in particular, bacterial cells can withstand up to  <dig> nm gc. on the other hand, yeast cells cannot survive even these gc levels and they can only withstand gc concentrations lower than  <dig> nm. having said this, the behavior of the system for gc levels up to  <dig> nm is analogous to facultative mutualism, i.e. both species benefit from but are not dependent on each other. however, when gcâ€™s level lies between  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm, the behavior of the system is similar to commensalism for bacteria, i.e. bacteria can survive without yeast but yeast are not able to survive without bacteria.

the lethal gc concentration for cultures with both cell types present is  <dig> Î¼m. based on this, we conclude that when gcâ€™s levels are between  <dig> nm and  <dig> Î¼m, the behavior of the system is homologous to obligatory mutualism as both species are completely dependent on each other and unable to survive individually. finally, for gc levels higher than  <dig> Î¼m, we observe ecosystemâ€™s extinction. such behaviors have been observed previously in similar synthetic bacterial ecosystems
 <cit>  and are shown in figure
 <dig>  the concentrations used in figure
 <dig> represent the boundaries between different systemâ€™s behavior . the population dynamic behavior for gc concentrations between the ones used here lies in the area between these lines.

figures
4c and
4d demonstrate deviation among the different cell density trajectories. note that this deviation could not be captured using deterministic simulations. the standard deviation  of the population size at  <dig> hours and for  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm, and  <dig> Î¼m gc is shown in table
 <dig> 

ecosystemâ€™s sensitivity to various carrying capacities and initial cell densities
we then explored the influence of cmax and the initial cell population on the synthetic ecosystemâ€™s behavior. as discussed above, the carrying capacity is the maximum number of  cells that can exist in the bioreactor
 <cit> . here, we only show average values of the  <dig> trials since the single trajectories exhibit similar behavior as in the previous cases. figures
5a  and
5b  show average population sizes for different cmax values.

as expected, an increase in cmax causes an increase on both yeast and bacterial steady state populations as the nutrients in the culture suffice for more cells. thus, both species grow faster and consequently survive in the presence of gc. it is important to note that a minimum amount of nutrients must exist in the bioreactor for the cells to grow and survive. thus, we ran simulations decreasing cmax to find this minimum threshold under which the ecosystem goes extinct. according to our simulation results, the minimum cmax in order for all the trajectories to end up in non-zero steady states  is equal to approximately  <dig> Â·  <dig> cells . thus, the model suggests that our synthetic ecosystem is fully functional only for reactor capacities equal to or higher than  <dig> Â·  <dig> cells.

as in the previous cases, deviation among the different population trajectories was observed. the steady state standard deviation of the population size for various reactor capacities is provided in table
 <dig>  notably, the larger the reactor capacity, the higher is the deviation among the different population trajectories.

we further explored the minimum initial number of total cells required in order for the two species population to cooperate favorably and survive. to do so, we performed different simulations starting with equal e. coli and s. cerevisiae populations and monitoring the systemâ€™s dynamics for  <dig>  hours. our results showed that for equal initial populations of the two species, the minimum number of s. cerevisiae and e. coli cells in the reactor should be approximately equal to  <dig> cells for the ecosystem to survive with gc. moreover, when the initial e. coli population is  <dig>  cells, the minimum s. cerevisiae initial population required in order for the system to avoid extinction is  <dig> cells. on the other hand, when the initial s. cerevisiae population is  <dig>  cells, the required e. coli initial population is  <dig> cells. this difference is ascribed to the fact that bacteria grow predominantly fast thereby quickly helping yeast to survive and therefore only  <dig> yeast cells are initially required to make the ecosystem functional. however, yeast grow and consequently rescue e. coli with a slower rate and therefore larger e. coli population is initially required for the ecosystem to function.

effects of e.coli cell death rates on the ecosystemâ€™s dynamics
it is clear from the aforementioned analysis that in most cases bacterial cell populations dominate yeast cell populations because of their high growth rate. we therefore introduced a bacteria degradation term in our network to enhance the competition between the population of the two species. we only considered e. coli degradation as bacteria grow significantly faster than yeast. this degradation could be achieved experimentally as bacteria can be engineered to stimulate their lysis in response to a human-defined signal. more specifically, introducing holin and lysozome genes that are activated via ahl signals, allows for controlling cell membrane destruction and consequently cell death
 <cit> .

initially, we performed our analysis under the assumption that the deterministic term dominates the stochastic term, i.e. the intrinsic noise of the system is negligible. the results presented in what follows were therefore produced based only on the deterministic part of the equations 1- <dig>  a similar approach has been used previously to explore the oscillatory behavior of a synthetic ecosystem
 <cit> .

as expected, high degradation rates cause bacterial cell death followed by yeast wash out due to obligatory mutualism . in contrast, low degradation rates allow yeast domination, as bacterial populations quickly decreases due to both gc and degradation, thereby allowing an increase in yeast population .

importantly, and as observed in other synthetic ecosystems composed of species with different growth rates
 <cit> , there is a range of bacterial degradation rate where s. cerevisiae and e. coli population exhibit sustained oscillations. these oscillations originate from the antagonism between the two species population and demonstrate a predator-prey like relationship between s. cerevisiae and e. coli cells. in particular, when the e. coli degradation rate, d, lies between  <dig>  hâˆ’ <dig> and  <dig>  hâˆ’ <dig>  sustained oscillations are observed. for d smaller than  <dig>  hâˆ’ <dig>  damped oscillations are exhibited. finally, for d larger than  <dig>  hâˆ’ <dig>  the two species population goes to zero. in other words, the ecosystem becomes extinct, since this high degradation rate results in bacterial death which in turn leads to yeast extinction because cell-cell communication cannot take place favorably anymore. figure
 <dig> shows the behavior of the two species population for degradation parameters that lie in the aforementioned ranges. when d is equal to  <dig>  hâˆ’ <dig>  we observe damped oscillations that end up on a stable steady state. however, from d =  <dig>  hâˆ’ <dig> to d =  <dig>  hâˆ’ <dig>  sustained oscillations whose amplitude scales with the degradation rate are observed. this trend is provided in figures
6c,
6d where d =  <dig>  hâˆ’ <dig>  finally, when d is larger than  <dig>  hâˆ’ <dig> the system is driven to extinction, as depicted in figures
6e and
6f.

the bifurcation diagram describing our ecosystemâ€™s oscillatory behavior is presented in figure
 <dig>  a hopf point, where sustained oscillations of the two species population initiate, is observed for d approximately equal to  <dig>  hâˆ’ <dig>  the hopf point was further confirmed by eigenvalue analysis. the lines following the hopf point correspond to the oscillation amplitude, as calculated from the transient analysis. please note that for the sake of clarity, in figure
7b we show the upper limit of oscillations only for d up to  <dig>  hâˆ’ <dig>  the complete bifurcation diagram is provided in the inset. the period of the oscillations was calculated using the fft  function in matlab and is depicted as inset in figure
7a. as evident, the period of the oscillations scales with the e. coli degradation rate. this is an intriguing observation which suggests that the e. coli degradation rate could be used to control the period of our oscillatory ecosystem.
7a.

it should be stressed that including the stochastic terms in our simulations, leads to the ecosystemâ€™s extinction. this has been observed before
 <cit>  and is caused by the fact that during the oscillations, the bacterial population reaches small values and therefore noise terms destroy the sustained oscillations by driving bacterial population to zero and consequently the ecosystem to extinction . in fact, the smaller the noise amplitude, the higher the probability for the system to circumvent extinction and exhibit sustained oscillations. figure
 <dig> shows a comparison between deterministic and stochastic simulations. for d =  <dig>  hâˆ’ <dig>  deterministic solution  provides sustained oscillations that end up in a steady state. stochastic simulations  are consistent with the deterministic ones, i.e. demonstrate oscillations, but only for a small period of time and subsequently all the trajectories reach zero. motivated by this observation, we performed several simulations  where we systematically decreased the noise terms amplitude. our simulations demonstrated that when the noise terms are  <dig> % or less of the current values, the stochastic behavior matches the deterministic one, i.e. the ecosystem population exhibits sustained oscillations. when the noise terms are between  <dig> % and 100% of the current values, there are always stochastic trajectories that reach zero over a period of  <dig>  hours. figures
8b and
8c show three population density trajectories of the stochastic simulation  compared with the deterministic simulation  when the noise terms are reduced to  <dig> %. as evident, the ecosystemâ€™s behavior provided by the two approaches is consistent and stochastic trajectories exhibit continuous oscillations.

overall, our simulations suggest that high amplitude intrinsic noise damages the ecosystemâ€™s oscillatory behavior. on the other hand, less noisy environments stimulate the sustained oscillation of the two species population.

CONCLUSIONS
we presented the in silico design of the first synthetic bacterial-yeast ecosystem where communication between cells is achieved using ahl signals. the model, while developed to accurately depict these interactions, can be adapted to characterize any cell-to-cell communication and population dynamics mediated by diffusible chemical signaling.

we showed that when the two species coexist, they overcome gcâ€™s toxicity by inducing each otherâ€™s resistance gene via small molecule signalling and therefore survive. our simulations suggest that the minimum reactor capacity required for this ecosystem to evolve is  <dig> Â· 105cells. by varying the gc concentration, the ecosystem adopts different behaviors including obligatory and facultative mutualism, commensalism and extinction. adding an e. coli degradation reaction, which can be experimentally realized by engineering bacteria to induce lysis, can drive the population of the two species to predator-prey like dynamics, i.e. sustained oscillations. these oscillations can, however, be destroyed in noisy environments. overall, we demonstrated that such kind of heterogeneous synthetic ecosystems could exhibit interesting dynamics.

as demonstrated here and in different studies
 <cit> , the development of synthetic microbial consortia using species with different characteristics  yields systems with intriguing dynamics, such as oscillations. these systems could have various potential applications such as the delivery of two different drugs in dissimilar time intervals
 <cit> .

our mathematical model may potentially drive the experimental design of microbial consortia with a heterogeneous population. this and similar mathematical models can further be used to predict interspecies bioreactor dynamics under numerous conditions, with differing chemical signals, and employing various population control mechanisms. engineered interspecies system have substantial implications for complex chemical synthesis as well as future biorefinery design and optimization. thus, the dynamics analysis presented herein may be used as the basis for the in vivo design of such promising synthetic ecosystems.
