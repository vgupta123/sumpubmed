BACKGROUND
the mmps, also called matrixin, play a key role in the processes of embryonic development, morphogenesis, reproduction, tissue remodeling and tumor invasion and metastasis  <cit> . mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> are geletinases, which degrade type iv collagen, a major constituent of basement membranes, denatured interstitial collagens , laminin, elastin, and fibronectin  <cit> . they are secreted as zymogens with a molecular weight of prommp- <dig> being  <dig> kda and prommp- <dig> being  <dig> kda. dermal fibroblasts produce and organize the extracellular matrix of the dermis. they are able to generate mmps including mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig>  collagen, other extracellular matrix components and cytokines upon activation  <cit> .

in recent years, thrombin has been discovered to play important roles in inflammatory and tissue repair processes by influencing vascular and blood cells including endothelial cells  <cit> , fibroblasts  <cit> , vascular smooth muscle cells  <cit> , t lymphocytes  <cit> , eosinophils  <cit>  and monocytes  <cit> . as a serine protease, thrombin exerts many of its actions through proteolytic activation of its receptors including protease-activated receptor - <dig>  par- <dig> and par- <dig>  <cit> . these receptors can also be activated without proteolytic cleavage using five to six residue peptides corresponding to the new n termini of the cleaved receptors  <cit> . pars are 'single-use' receptors: proteolytic activation is irreversible and the cleaved receptors are degraded in lysosomes. thus, pars play important roles in 'emergency situations', such as trauma and inflammation, although their other potential downstream signaling targets have not been fully established  <cit> .

recently, it was demonstrated that human dermal fibroblasts express par- <dig> and par- <dig>  and thrombin is able to stimulate il- <dig> release from these fibroblasts predominantly through mapk/erk and p <dig> mapk signaling pathways  <cit> . however, little is known of influence of thrombin on mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> release from fibroblasts. we therefore investigate the action of thrombin on mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> release from primary hdfs and its potential intracellular signaling pathways in the present study.

RESULTS
expression of pars in hdfs
immunofluorescence staining showed that primary cultured hdfs expressed proteins of par- <dig>  par- <dig>  par- <dig>  but not par- <dig> . an agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that primary cultured hdfs expressed par- <dig>  par- <dig>  par- <dig>  but not par- <dig> mrnas .

influence of thrombin on prommp- <dig> and prommp- <dig> secretion from hdfs
thrombin at the concentrations of  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> u/ml provoked a concentration-dependent increase in prommp- <dig> activity from primary cultured hdfs following  <dig> h incubation. as little as  <dig> u/ml of thrombin was able to induce significant increase in release of prommp- <dig> activity from hdfs . the upregulated expression of mmp- <dig> mrna in hdfs was found when hdfs were incubated with thrombin at  <dig> and  <dig> u/ml for  <dig> h . in contrast, thrombin at the concentrations tested had no siginificant effect either on secretion of prommp- <dig> activity  or on expression mmp- <dig> mrna  following  <dig> h incubation period. hirudin, a specific thrombin inhibitor at the concentrations of  <dig> and  <dig> u/ml completely abolished thrombin-induced release of prommp- <dig> activity after  <dig> h incubation .

sfllr-nh <dig>  a par- <dig> agonist peptide at the concentration of  <dig> μm induced a significant release of prommp- <dig> activity at  <dig> h following incubation . it appeared that sfllr-nh <dig> at  <dig> μm was able to also elicit enhanced secretion of prommp- <dig> activity from hdfs though this did not reach statistical significance level . as a positive control, tgfβ at  <dig> ng/ml induced significant release of prommp- <dig> activity from hdfs . rllfs-nh <dig>  a reverse peptide of sfllr-nh <dig> had little effect on release of prommp- <dig> and prommp- <dig> activities from hdfs . a par- <dig> blocking antibody completely blocked sfllr-nh <dig> induced release of prommp- <dig> activity .

effect of pd <dig>  ly <dig> and ag <dig> on thrombin-induced release of prommp- <dig> activity
following  <dig> h and  <dig> h incubation periods, ag <dig>  a jak/stat <dig> pathway inhibitor reduced significantly basal and thrombin-provoked release of prommp- <dig> activity  and expression of prommp- <dig> mrna in hdfs . it was observed also that pd <dig>  an inhibitor of mapk pathway and ly <dig>  an inhibitor of pi3k were able to inhibit thrombin-provoked release of prommp- <dig> activity from hdfs though the inhibition does not reach statistical significance level . ag <dig>  pd <dig> and ly <dig> have little influence on basal or thrombin-induced release of prommp- <dig> activity from hdfs following both  <dig> h and  <dig> h incubation periods .

effect of ag <dig> on stat <dig> phosphorylation in hdfs
thrombin at a concentration of  <dig> u/ml enhanced phosphorylation of stat <dig> in hdfs following  <dig> min,  <dig> h and  <dig> h incubation periods. the action of thrombin on jak/stat <dig> pathway was completely abolished by ag <dig>  ag <dig> also significantly reduced basal phosphorylation of stat <dig> in hdfs following  <dig> min,  <dig> h and  <dig> h incubation periods .

effect of pd <dig> on erk 1/ <dig> phosphorylation in hdfs
thrombin at a concentration of  <dig> u/ml induced an enhanced phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> in hdfs following  <dig> h and  <dig> h incubation periods. pd <dig> was able to completely block thrombin induced phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> when it was incubated with hdfs for  <dig> h and  <dig> h. pd <dig> inhibited also basal phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> in hdfs following  <dig> h and  <dig> h incubation periods 

effect of ly <dig> on akt phosphorylation in hdfs
thrombin at a concentration of  <dig> u/ml failed to induce significantly increased phosphorylation of akt in hdfs. ly <dig> diminished basal phosphorylation of akt in hdfs at  <dig> h, but not  <dig> h following incubation, but had little effect on the action of thrombin in hdfs .

discussion
it was found that thrombin was able to induce prommp- <dig> secretion from primary cultured hdfs, indicating that it is likely involved in the tissue remodeling process in the body. in the parallel experiment, thrombin failed to stimulate enhanced prommp- <dig> activity release from hdfs, implicating that the action of thrombin on hdfs was a selective one. selective release of mmp- <dig> from fibroblasts has been observed previously with rat mast cell sonicate  <cit> , which may support the above view. since the prommp- <dig> activity released from hdfs in response to thrombin at  <dig> and  <dig> u/ml and sfllr-nh <dig> at  <dig> μm was similar to the activity released in response to tgfβ at  <dig> ng/ml, it implicated that thrombin was a potent secretogogue of prommp- <dig> activity release from hdfs.

it appeared that thrombin induced prommp- <dig> release was most likely through activation of par- <dig> as hdfs express par- <dig>  par- <dig> and par- <dig>  par- <dig> is not a receptor for thrombin and par- <dig> could not be activated by thrombin alone  <cit> . our preliminary experiment revealed that a specific agonist peptide of par- <dig>  tfrgap-nh <dig> had little effect on prommp- <dig> or prommp- <dig> release from hdfs . the observations that an agonist peptide of par- <dig>  sfllr-nh <dig>  but not its reverse peptide was able to stimulate prommp- <dig> release from hdfs, and that par- <dig> blocking antibody completely blocked the action of sfllr-nh <dig> on hdfs comfirmed that activation of par- <dig> was responsible for thrombin induced release of prommp- <dig> from hdfs. the par- <dig> blocking antibody atap <dig> employed in the present study was reported previously as a cleavage-blocking anti-par- <dig> antibody, which abolished completely activated-protein-c induced activation of par- <dig>  <cit> . it has been reported before that activation of par- <dig> could cause release of il- <dig>  <cit> , monocyte chemotactic protein- <dig>  <cit>  and il- <dig>  <cit>  from fibroblasts, which may further support our current finding that stimulation of prommp- <dig> release from hdfs by thrombin is likely through activation of par- <dig> 

it seems likely that thrombin induced prommp- <dig> release was associated with jak/stat <dig>  but not mapk/erk and pi3k/akt signaling pathways as inhibitors of stat <dig> was able to inhibit thrombin induced prommp- <dig> release. the observations that thrombin was capable of stimulating phosphorylation of stat <dig>  and that ag <dig> could inhibit thrombin provoked phosphorylation of stat <dig> indicate further that thrombin induced prommp- <dig> release is associated with jak/stat <dig> signaling pathway in hdfs. however, ag <dig> itself inhibited basal phosphorylation of stat <dig>  indicating phosphorylation of stat <dig> occurred even when these cells were not under stimulation. provoking phosphorylation of stat <dig> by thrombin has been found with vascular smooth muscle cells previously  <cit> .

although pd <dig>  a specific inhibitor of mapk pathway eliminated thrombin induced phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig>  it failed to significantly inhibit thrombin induced prommp- <dig> release from hdfs, indicating mapk/erk signaling pathway is unlikely a major pathway for thrombin induced prommp- <dig> release. it may serve as a major signaling pathway for thrombin induced other events in hdfs, such as il- <dig> release from hdfs <cit>  and proliferation of astrocytes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
thrombin is a potent stimulus of prommp- <dig> release from hdfs. the action of thrombin on hdfs is most likely through activation of par- <dig>  jak/stat <dig> signaling pathway is involved in prommp- <dig> release from hdfs. since mmp- <dig> presents at elevated levels during early wound healing  <cit>  the finding in the present study may suggest that thrombin is actively involved in tissue remodeling process of new wound in skin.
