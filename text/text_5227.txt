BACKGROUND
just over a decade after being identified as a leukocyte surface antigen with receptorial activity  <cit> , cd <dig> was re-classified among the adp-ribosyl  cyclases  <cit> . these are a group of related membrane-bound or soluble enzymes, comprising cd <dig> and aplysia adpr cyclase  <cit> , which have the unique capacity to convert nad to cyclic adp ribose  or nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphate , part of a new generation of endogenous activators of intracellular ca2+ release  <cit> .

human cd <dig> is a broadly expressed type ii transmembrane glycoprotein of ~ <dig> kda in its monomeric form  <cit> . this consists of a short intracytoplasmic  tail, a transmembrane domain and a major extracellular domain  formed by  <dig> of the  <dig> constituent amino acids of the cd <dig> polypeptide  <cit> . homodimeric and homotetrameric forms have also been described  <cit>  and a 3-d dimer structure obtained by homology modeling to aplysia cyclase  <cit> . the cd <dig> ecd, where both receptor and enzymatic activities reside, harbours a  <dig> cysteine/ <dig> disulfide signature common to the members of this family. according to a growing body of experimental evidence, the disulfides mediate control of the ecd conformation and function since reduction modifies cd <dig> enzymatic activity and homodimerization  <cit> , and sensitivity to proteolysis and monoclonal antibody  binding  <cit> .

the mobilization of intracellular ca2+ caused by the cd38/cadpr/naadp axis has been implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological processes including insulin secretion and diabetes  <cit> , myometrial contractility and pregnancy  <cit> , airway smooth muscle contractility and hyperreactivity  <cit> , vascular smooth muscle contraction  <cit> , osteoclast activity  <cit> , and the functions of the immune  <cit> , renal  <cit>  and exocrine gland  <cit>  systems. the assortment of effects caused by cd <dig> ligation and transmembrane signalling is also broad though mostly described in hematopoietic cells, and ranges from lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine release  <cit> , regulation of b and myeloid cell development and survival  <cit> , inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus  entry  <cit> , to induction of dendritic cell maturation  <cit> . in addition, ligation of human pancreatic islet cells by anti-cd <dig> autoantibodies induces insulin release  <cit> . cd <dig> is also a clinically useful marker of hiv infection progression  <cit>  and therapy-requiring b-cll  <cit> .

in this study, we describe the molecular cloning and functional expression of cd <dig> from the cynomolgus macaque. in addition, with a panel of newly-raised mabs, we comparatively analyse the macaque and human cd <dig> ecds and identify new structural-functional characteristics of cd <dig> epitopes.

RESULTS
cloning cd <dig> cdna from cynomolgus macaque
activation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells  with phytohemagglutinin  strongly upregulates expression of cd <dig> in human t lymphocytes  <cit> . therefore, to isolate a cd <dig> cdna, pha-activated cynomolgus pbmc were chosen as the source of rna for amplification by rt-pcr using primers derived from the human cd <dig> 5' and 3' untranslated regions. the  <dig> base-pair  insert contained an open reading frame of  <dig> bp  that was 95% identical to the human cd <dig> sequence. the cdna encodes a  <dig> amino acid  polypeptide with the typical cd <dig> type ii membrane protein structure, i.e., a short cytosolic tail , a transmembrane region , and an ecd  containing the signature 12-cysteine array. alignment of the macaque and human cd <dig> polypeptides showed 92% identity and 94% similarity. there is complete conservation of the ic region while there are five conservative changes in the transmembrane region where macaque cd <dig> has one more residue than human cd <dig>  macaque cd <dig> has four potential n-linked glycosylation sites, as in human cd38; three are co-linear. furthermore, macaque cd <dig> shows conservation of the  <dig> acidic residues  and  <dig> tryptophans  that play a critical role in the adp-ribosyl cyclase/cadpr hydrolase activities of human cd <dig>  <cit> . lys <dig> is also maintained suggesting that, like human cd <dig>  binding of atp to this residue may lead to inhibition of the hydrolase activity  <cit> . likewise, macaque cd <dig> conserves arg <dig> which is adp-ribosylated in human cd <dig>  causing inactivation  <cit> .

common genomic organization and regulatory features of macaque and human cd <dig> genes
human cd <dig> has been characterized as a single-copy, 8-exon gene that spans ~ <dig> kb  <cit>  and not only cd <dig> but adpr cyclase genes in general are highly conserved from mollusks to humans  <cit> . in addition, the southern blot hybridization patterns of macaque and human genomic dnas digested with ecori, bamhi and hindiii and probed with their homologous cd <dig> cdna are similar , indicating that the structural organization of macaque and human cd <dig> is highly conserved. this was further demonstrated by the finding that the same primers previously used to amplify the  <dig> human cd <dig> exons  <cit>  also amplified  <dig> cd <dig> exons from macaque genomic dna. the putative macaque exons could be perfectly aligned with their human counterparts  <cit>  in number, size and splice site of their exons . all intron-exon boundaries conformed to the gt-ag rule, most 5' splice donor and 3' splice acceptor sequences of the  <dig> introns were identical.

transcription of tata-boxless human cd <dig> initiates at multiple start sites  <cit>  while induction of gene expression by retinoids is controlled by a retinoic acid responsive element  at the beginning of intron  <dig>  <cit> . to identify conserved cis-regulatory sequences, ~ <dig> bp upstream of the initiation codon atg were amplified by pcr from genomic dna of cynomolgus macaque but also from chimpanzee , to strengthen the alignment with the human cd <dig> promoter sequence, and numerous conserved general and immune-related potential binding sites were found . the alignment of the 5' end of intron  <dig> from macaque and human cd <dig> shows the presence of the rare , suggesting that this and perhaps other molecular mechanisms involved in regulating cd <dig> are conserved between these primates.

expression of macaque cd <dig> reveals an active cyclase of ~ <dig> kda
to analyse surface expression and function of macaque cd <dig>  the cdna insert was subcloned into the pcdna <dig>  expression vector and a similar construct was prepared containing the human cd <dig> cdna . dnas were transfected for heterologous expression in the nih/3t <dig> cell line which does not express cd <dig>  <cit> . given that cross-reactivity of okt <dig> anti-human cd <dig> mab has been exploited to detect cd <dig> in rhesus macaque hematopoietic cells  <cit> , clones expressing cynomolgus cd <dig> were identified by indirect immunofluorescence  with okt <dig> . the stable cell line expressing macaque cd <dig> was designated nih/mac <dig>  while nih/hum <dig> is the human cd38-expressing cell line.

the ecto-cyclase activity of macaque cd <dig> was evaluated by incubating the nih/mac <dig> clone with nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide , an nad analog which is converted by adp-ribosyl cyclases such as cd <dig> to cyclic gdp ribose . unlike cadpr, cgdpr is a stable, fluorescent end-product which can be detected in cell supernatants  <cit> . increased fluorescence following incubation with ngd was detected in supernatants of macaque and human cd <dig> transfectants, demonstrating that macaque cd <dig> is enzymatically active .

in human red blood cells , cd <dig> is the only source of ecto-cyclase activity  <cit>  which was also found on the surface of cynomolgus macaque rbcs , suggesting a further parallel with human cd <dig> 

to establish the approximate molecular weight of macaque cd <dig>  sds-page and western blot analysis were performed with lysates prepared from nih/mac <dig> and nih/hum <dig> cells. blots were probed with the at <dig> anti-human cd <dig> mab which detected a band of ~ <dig> kda in both transfectants .

production of anti-macaque cd <dig> mabs
to raise mouse mabs against macaque cd <dig>  live nih/mac <dig> cells were used for immunization. four mabs, kk1b <dig> , kk4e <dig> , kk6a <dig>  and kk9h <dig>  were selected for further analyses. all four anti-macaque cd <dig> mabs reacted by if with nih/mac <dig> but were negative with the parental cell line . only two mabs  reacted with nih/hum <dig> 

the anti-macaque cd <dig> mabs were further assessed by if for binding to cynomolgus pbmc and to sl- <dig> and sl- <dig>  two cynomolgus macaque b lymphoblastoid cell lines. all four mabs reacted with pbmc from cynomolgus macaques, indicating they recognize native cynomolgus cd <dig>  and they strongly stained cells of the two b cell lines .

â€ƒ
pbmc
a+++, very strong reactivity; ++, strong reactivity; +, weak reactivity; -, no reactivity.

additional western blot analyses were carried out with the anti-macaque cd <dig> mabs. mabs kk1b <dig> and kk9h <dig> confirmed detection of a ~ <dig> kda band in nih/mac <dig> cell lysates but also recognized a second band of ~ <dig> kda. . the doublet was also identified in sl- <dig> cynomolgus b cells . instead mabs kk4e <dig> and kk6a <dig> only recognized a band of ~ <dig> kda, even in reducing conditions. no bands were detected by these mabs in parental nih/3t <dig> cells.

anti-macaque cd <dig> mabs recognize either species-specific/dtt-resistant epitopes or a human cross-reactive/dtt-sensitive epitope
the observation that mabs kk4e <dig> and kk6a <dig> recognize only cynomolgus cd <dig> while mabs kk1b <dig> and kk9h <dig> also recognize human cd <dig> indicates that the two mab subsets are directed towards different epitopes. to evaluate the contribution of disulfides to these epitopes, mab reactivity was assessed after treating nih/mac <dig> with dithiothreitol . reduction had no effect on binding of the species-specific mabs  but significantly reduced binding of mabs kk1b <dig> and kk9h <dig> , indicating that the latter recognize a disulfide-requiring conformational epitope of the cynomolgus cd <dig> ecd, and predicting they should recognize a similar epitope in human cd <dig>  the results  confirm that treatment of nih/hum <dig> with dtt decreased binding of mabs kk1b <dig> and kk9h <dig>  indicating that cynomolgus macaque and human cd <dig> have a conformational epitope in common.

anti-human cd <dig> mabs are also species-specific/dtt-resistant or cross-reactive/dtt-sensitive
reciprocal experiments were performed to see if the correlation between cross-reactivity and epitope sensitivity to dtt was also valid for a panel of  <dig> well-known mabs raised against human cd <dig>  mabs ib <dig>  ib <dig>  okt <dig>  sun-4b <dig>  at <dig> and hb <dig> were assessed for binding to native and dtt-treated nih/hum <dig>  and for cross-reactivity with cynomolgus cd <dig>  binding of mabs ib <dig>  ib <dig> and hb <dig> to human cd <dig> was unaffected by dtt and none bound cynomolgus cd <dig> . on the contrary, binding of mabs okt <dig>  sun-4b <dig> and at <dig> to human cd <dig> was significantly reduced by dtt and all three mabs bound cynomolgus cd <dig>  in a dtt-sensitive manner.

the epitope recognized by cross-reactive cynomolgus anti-cd <dig> mabs maps to the c-terminal disulfide loop
the observation that mabs kk1b <dig> and kk9h <dig>  and mabs okt <dig>  at <dig> and sun-4b <dig>  all bind native but not reduced cynomolgus and human cd <dig> is compatible with their binding the same epitope. a priori knowledge of the human cd <dig> epitope map previously established that okt <dig> binding is abrogated by deletion of one or both of the c-terminal cys residues  predicted to pair in disulfide bond formation  <cit>  and that mabs okt <dig>  at <dig> and sun-4b <dig> mutually compete for binding to the human cd <dig> ecd  <cit> . this would position the common epitope of cynomolgus and human cd <dig> in the c-terminal disulfide loop formed by cys <dig> and cys <dig> in cynomolgus cd <dig> .

to test this possibility, we analysed reactivity of these mabs with the cd38-negative mt <dig> human t cell line stably transfected with cd38Î” <dig>  a human cd <dig> deletion mutant which lacks the  <dig> c-terminal amino acids and loses okt <dig> binding  <cit> . if analysis demonstrates that the  <dig> c-terminal amino acids of human cd <dig> are required for binding of mabs kk1b <dig>  kk9h <dig> and okt <dig> . in contrast, mabs sun-4b <dig> and at <dig> maintained binding to mt2/cd38Î” <dig> . these data are consistent with the presence of two close conformational epitopes in human and cynomolgus cd38: one identified by mabs kk1b <dig>  kk9h <dig> and okt <dig> located in the last  disulfide loop, the other by mabs sun-4b <dig> and at <dig> mapping to the penultimate  c-terminal disulfide loop involving cys254-cys <dig> . note that human-cynomolgus cd <dig> amino acid sequence identity in the 5th loop is 20/ <dig> amino acids, and 10/ <dig> amino acids in the 6th loop.

discussion
in this study, we describe the molecular cloning and functional expression of the cd <dig> receptor/enzyme from the cynomolgus macaque. the cdna described here presents the expected homology to human cd <dig> considering that the macaque-human lineages diverged some  <dig> million years ago  <cit>  and their genomes are 93â€“95% identical. this homology was exploited in rt-pcr cloning and in our genomic pcr survey of cynomolgus cd <dig>  indeed, human cd <dig> primers proved to be equally agile with cd <dig> in other members of the primate order such as the chimpanzee, the gibbon  and the rhesus monkey  .

the conceptual translation of the cynomolgus macaque cd <dig> cdna yielded a polypeptide with the characteristic type ii structure, size, catalytic core residues and 12-cysteine ecd array common to cd <dig> orthologs. with respect to human cd <dig>  cynomolgus cd <dig> has an extra residue in the transmembrane domain but no difference was found in the ic tail, where human cd <dig> is reported to interact with the sh <dig> domain of lck  <cit>  in lipid rafts  <cit> .

cross-reactivity of anti-human cd <dig> mabs was exploited in the initial part of the protein analyses although these give discrepant results in binding to leukocytes from other primates. for example, okt <dig>  but not leu <dig> or t <dig>  binds bone marrow from rhesus macaques  <cit>  whereas hit <dig> stains horse lymphocytes but not leukocytes from baboon, cynomolgus macaque, rhesus macaque, pig, sheep, cow, dog, cat or rabbit  <cit> . in addition, the behaviour of cross-reactive mabs may not be reproducible in another species as illustrated by anti-human cd <dig> mabs:  <dig> out of  <dig> mabs cross-reacted with cynomolgus bone marrow but only  <dig> of these correctly identified the functional cynomolgus equivalent of the human progenitor cell in clonogenic assays  <cit> . to avoid similar pitfalls, we raised mabs to macaque cd <dig> 

the apparent molecular weight of macaque and human cd <dig> were indistinguishable by sds-page. the macaque polypeptide weighs  <dig>  kda and has four n-linked glycosylation motifs, suggesting it is probably glycosylated, like human cd <dig>  <cit> , to give rise to the  <dig> kda band. we wanted to confirm this result with anti-cynomolgus cd <dig> mabs but when lysates were probed with mabs kk1b <dig> and kk9h <dig>  the  <dig> kda band was always accompanied by an  <dig> kda band, and the doublet was also observed with lysates obtained from sl- <dig> macaque b cells expressing cd <dig> in its native milieu. the kk4e <dig> and kk6a <dig> mabs instead detected only the  <dig> kda band in transfectants, and the band was unaffected by addition of dtt. cd <dig> dimers and tetramers have been abundantly reported and postulated to be formed by diverse mechanisms such as intermolecular disulfides  <cit> , non-covalent association  <cit>  and transglutamination  <cit> . therefore, our interpretation of the upper band is that it represents a cd <dig> dimer, possibly a non-covalently associated form compatible with lysate preparation in np- <dig> detergent which stabilizes such dimers  <cit> , or a transglutaminase-linked form. although the data are consistent with kk4e <dig> and kk6a <dig> recognizing a unique epitope in macaque cd <dig> dimers, it is also possible that these mabs have another unknown specificity and that further experiments are needed to fully characterize their specificity.

the availability of the macaque cd <dig> amino acid sequence and its alignment with the human homolog gave a new dimension to the analysis of mab cross-reactivity and ultimately led to a better understanding of cd <dig> epitopes. macaque and human cd <dig> are strikingly conserved yet only two of the four anti-macaque cd <dig> mabs cross-reacted, as did only three of the six anti-human cd <dig> mabs in reciprocal experiments. the key finding was that a mab's capacity to cross-react always correlated with the sensitivity of its target to reduction which, added to the prior knowledge of the human cd <dig> epitope map, crystal structure and active site  <cit> , allowed us to footprint the binding sites of cross-reactive anti-cd <dig> mabs.

the classification of anti-primate cd <dig> mabs as species-specific/dtt-resistant  or cross-reactive/dtt-sensitive  and directed against a conformational epitope may be of practical importance. firstly, our results demonstrate the necessity for careful antibody selection when performing biological assays involving detection of cd <dig> expression in circumstances of cell membrane redox perturbation, e.g., detection of membrane cd <dig> in apoptotic cells might be positive according to type i mabs and negative by type ii . secondly, simultaneous use of the two types of mabs can provide information about cd <dig> expression  while the type ii mab can give indications on its conformation. thirdly, it is possible that potent ca2+-mobilizing agonistic mabs are more likely to be type i mabs since this subgroup includes ib <dig>  which is the only anti-human cd <dig> mab to mobilize ca2+, and nim-r <dig>  a rat anti-murine cd <dig> mab  <cit>  which also mobilizes ca2+ and whose binding to murine cd <dig> transfectants was not affected by dtt . finally, autoantibodies to cd <dig> have been detected in diabetes and thyroiditis and it would be interesting to identify the epitopic culprits.

CONCLUSIONS
some of the essential biological features of cd <dig> in macaca fascicularis have been elucidated and new insights obtained about the epitopic structure of the cd <dig> ecd. we hope that, by providing the reagents for analysis of cd <dig> in the cynomolgus macaque, this study may expedite our understanding of the role of cd <dig> in human disease.
