BACKGROUND
helicases are encoded by a large fraction of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes and are found in all organisms –from bacteria to humans– and in many viruses. these nucleic acid-dependent ntpases  have the ability to unwind dna or rna duplex substrates; to unwind/separate the helical structure of double-stranded nucleic acids and, in some cases, to disrupt protein-nucleic acid interactions  <cit> .

dna and rna helicases are grouped into six superfamilies . sf <dig> and sf <dig> do not form rings, whereas sf <dig> to sf <dig> comprise the ring-forming helicases  <cit> . all eukaryotic rna helicases belong to sf <dig> and sf <dig>  whereas the ring-shaped rna helicases are found in viruses  <cit>  and bacteria  <cit> . functional groups for atp binding and hydrolysis are highly conserved among sf <dig> and sf <dig> dna and rna helicases. in addition, these two superfamilies show high sequence similarity in their conserved regions, sharing eight conserved motifs; and variations within these conserved motifs are used to distinguish between these very closely related families.

the helicases from sf <dig> and sf <dig> are further divided into families, based on their sequence, structural, and mechanistic features  <cit> . according to an excellent classification proposed by jankowsky’s group, these helicases can be grouped into three families in the sf <dig> and nine families and one group in the sf <dig>  <cit> . although several helicase families contain both rna and dna helicases, six of these twelve families only contain rna helicases . as they are mainly composed by rna helicases, these  <dig> families are termed “rna helicase families”, and are often referred to as dexd/h proteins.

in the sf <dig> and sf <dig> helicases, the conserved motifs are clustered in a “central” core region that spans about  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids . by contrast, the n- and c-terminal extensions of helicases are highly variable in size and composition. these regions are supposed to confer substrate specificity, comprising protein- and/or rna-binding motifs that provide helicases with their capacity to be involved in multiple processes, and/or direct the helicases to their subcellular localization  <cit> . within these extensions helicases also contain accessory domains that can confer specific functions, as in the case of the bidentate rnase iii enzyme dicer  <cit> . the conservation of these domains within a family is null; therefore, they are not used to define a typical group.

rna is involved in virtually all aspects of gene expression, playing important regulatory roles in biological reactions and making rnas biologically important molecules required by all living organisms. rna helicases may act as a temporary clamp to prevent rnas from re-associating, thereby allowing other rna-rna or rna-protein interactions to occur. a recent report suggests that these proteins can also function as rnpases  <cit> , which are enzymes that disrupt rna-protein interactions.

giardia lamblia is a single-celled eukaryotic microorganism that inhabits in the upper small intestine of humans and several other vertebrates. phylogenetic studies have placed giardia as one of the most early-branching eukaryotic cells  <cit> . in addition to its biological relevance, g. lamblia is one of the leading causes of human intestinal disease worldwide, the most frequent cause of defined waterborne outbreaks of diarrhea in developed countries and a common cause of diarrhea in daycare centers, institutionalized individuals, backpackers, and travelers  <cit> . the parasite has a simple life cycle, comprising the disease-causing trophozoites and the environmentally-resistant cysts, which are responsible for the transmission of the disease among susceptible hosts  <cit> . giardia undergoes important adaptive mechanisms to survive both inside and outside the host’s intestine, such as “antigenic variation” and “encystation”, respectively  <cit> . antigenic variation is characterized by the continuous switching of surface antigenic molecules, which allows the parasite to evade the immune response generated by the host  <cit> . in giardia, antigenic variation involves variant-specific surface proteins , cysteine-rich type 1a membrane proteins that cover the entire surface of the trophozoites  <cit> . only one vsp, of approximately  <dig> vsp genes present in the parasite’s genome, is expressed on the surface of individual trophozoites at a given time, but switching to a different vsp occurs once every 6- <dig> generations. antigenic variation in giardia is regulated post-transcriptionally by a mechanism similar to rna interference   <cit> . notably, disruption of the rnai pathway by knocking-down the expression of the dsrna endonuclease dicer promotes a change from single to multiple vsp expression on the surface of individual giardia cells, indicating the direct involvement of this enzyme in controlling antigenic variation in this parasite  <cit> . nonetheless, gdicer lacks the c-terminal rna helicase domain, raising question about the function of this domain in dicer enzymes of higher eukaryotes.

g. lamblia possesses functional rnai machinery  <cit> . however, this early-branching eukaryote lacks drosha and exportin  <dig> molecules needed to process and export mirna from the cell nucleus into the cytoplasm as well as other essential components of the rnai machinery found in higher eukaryotes  <cit> . it was recently proposed, however, that lack of drosha and exportin  <dig> in giardia could be bypassed by the use of snornas as mirnas precursors  <cit> . interestingly, giardia dicer is still capable of robust dicing and of complementing the lack of a functional dicer in schizosaccharomyces pombe  as well as orf-derived mirnas with gdicer apparently assuming the functions of both drosha and dicer  <cit> . hence, two questions arise:  are rna helicases truly involved in the giardia rnai pathway?  what is the minimal protein repertoire for post-transcriptional gene silencing in eukaryotic cells?

in the present study, we identified the complete set of sf <dig> helicases in this anaerobic flagellated protozoan by searching the g. lamblia genome database of the wb isolate, which allowed the identification of  <dig> dead-box,  <dig> deah-box and  <dig> ski2p putative rna helicases, along with seven helicases of family swi2/snf <dig>   <dig> helicases from family recq and  <dig> helicases from family rad <dig>  these sequences were used to analyze the relationship between the composition of the sf <dig> helicases in giardia and their corresponding homologs in yeast and humans. in addition, the level of expression during antigenic variation and encystation was analyzed, demonstrating both differential and variable expression of individual rna helicases in these processes. we also discuss the potential role of the rna helicase domain in dicer enzymes of higher eukaryotes.

RESULTS
identification of sf <dig> helicases in giardia lamblia
by using the human eif4a  amino acid sequence as the dead-box helicase prototype  <cit>  and the human atp-dependent rna-helicase dhx <dig> amino acid sequence as the deah-box helicase prototype  <cit> , we performed an extensive analysis of the giardia assemblage a, isolate wb, genome database  <cit>  and detected  <dig> and  <dig> orthologs, respectively. we were also able to obtain the sequences of  <dig> putative rna helicases belonging to the ski <dig> family, which is generally classified inside the dexh-box family; and a previously described upf <dig> homolog from sf <dig>  <cit> . these helicases belong to three of the nine families described from sf <dig>  therefore, in an attempt to identify any other helicase from this superfamily we performed a psi-blastp search within the giardia genome using the sequences described from humans, yeast and escherichia coli, following fairman-williams  <cit> . using this approach, we were able to recognize  <dig> additional putative helicases from three different families,  <dig> helicases from the recq family,  <dig> helicases from the swi2/snf <dig> family, and  <dig> helicases from the rad <dig> family. the sequences from the remaining three families of sf <dig> helicases present in humans, yeast and e. coli  do not have significant homology with any gene of g. lamblia.

the giardia database gene number, the contig number and position, and the gene length and codified protein molecular weight for each one of the sf <dig> helicases studied in this work are summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the hcd is virtually conserved in length between the three rna helicases families, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, whereas the greatest differences found, as expected, were in the n- and c-terminal regions of each helicase family .

the presence of  <dig> to  <dig> motifs considered as “signature sequences” were useful for the classification of each putative rna helicase within a specific family. this approach has already been used to identify dexd/h helicases in human, yeast, rice, entamoeba histolytica, plasmodium falciparum, leishmania major, trypanosoma cruzi and trypanosoma brucei . the relationship between the number of dead-box and dexh-box helicases supports our finding of  <dig> dead-box and  <dig> dexh-box  in giardia. multiple sequence analysis generated a phylogenetic tree, showing the evolutionary separation of these six families  .


* deah-box and ski2-like families.

blastp analyses of the  <dig> g. lamblia sf <dig> helicases within the ncbi human database presented the following ranges of identity and similarity, respectively: dead-box family ; deah-box family ; ski <dig> family ; swi2/snf <dig> family ; recq family ; rad <dig> family . the unique upf <dig> sequence presents 39% identity and 52% similarity to human upf <dig>  the yeast rna helicase homologs, their predicted protein function and other features are also included in additional file 4: table s <dig> for each helicase identified in g. lamblia. the high sequence similarity between putatives rna helicases from giardia and the characterized homologous proteins suggest that they may have a similar function in rna metabolism.

the dead-box family
the  <dig> sequences identified from this family were aligned for further analysis and the nine consensus motifs described in dead-box rna helicases from other organisms were found. the open reading frame  gl50803_ <dig> lacks the n-terminal region including the q motif; when we performed a new database search, we found that the homologous gene gl50581_ <dig> from assemblage b, isolate gs, possesses the complete n-terminal region. thus, we used this region to search the isolate wb genome database and found the missing region at the ch <dig>  location 21991– <dig>  the final gene location was at the ch <dig>   <dig> –  <dig> , and the gene coded for a 667-amino acid protein with all the nine consensus motifs of the dead-box subfamily, including the q motif. this motif contains nine amino acids, which is a distinctive and characteristic feature of the dead-box family of helicases, and can interact with motif i and a bound atp  <cit> .

another characteristic amino acid, the phe  residue that is close to the q motif was also found in  <dig> of the  <dig> enzymes, whereas in other  <dig> helicases, phe  was replaced by trp , another aromatic amino acid, being absent only in gl50803_ <dig> and gl50803_ <dig> . to provide a schematic graphical overview of dead-box sequence motif conservation, we performed a multiple sequence alignment for each motif and then used the weblogo software to obtain a precise description of sequence similarity  <cit>  . analysis of regions separating each pair of consecutive motifs was consistent with the reported low sequence but high length conservation   <cit> . the dead-box family has an n-terminal length ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids and a c-terminal length from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, but lack any additional domain described in other dead-box proteins   <cit> . in agreement with the analyses of banroques  <cit> , we found that almost 55% of giardia putative dead-box helicases have an n-terminal length of 2- <dig> residues and a c-terminal length of 29- <dig> residues, whereas the size of the hcd containing the conserved motifs ranges between  <dig> and  <dig> residues in almost 70% of this family sequences.


the deah-box family
the  <dig> putative rna helicases belonging to the deah-box family were analyzed by multiple sequence alignment and subsequent manual scanning, in search of conserved motifs characteristic of this family. as shown in additional file 6: figure s <dig>  the  <dig> helicases present the eight characteristic motifs, with the exception of gl50803_ <dig>  which was incomplete in its n-terminal region, missing motif i. as with the missing motif of dead-box helicase gl50803_ <dig>  a new database search showed a homologous gene, gl50581_ <dig> from the isolate gs, with the complete n-terminal region that was used to search the isolate wb for the entire orf. surprisingly, this new putative 5´ dna genomic region does not have a traditional atg start codon; instead, there are two putative alternative initiation codons already described in rare cases for the fungus candida albicans <cit>  or in mammalian nat <dig>  <cit> . studies in progress are analyzing this finding.

the consensus sequence was obtained and was in agreement with the deah-box motifs published by linder and owttrim  <cit>  . within the c-terminal regions from five of these six putative deah-box rna helicases, we found another domain called helicase associated domain , of about 90- <dig> amino acid in length , whose function is unknown. the ha <dig> domain was found in more than  <dig>  eukaryotic and  <dig> bacterial protein sequences according to the smart  database  <cit> , and was present only in this deah-box family, being absent in all other giardia putative rna helicases. for two of these deah-box proteins, there was an additional domain called duf <dig> .


the ski <dig> family
within this family, we found only four orfs in the giardia genome that were grouped according to the analysis of each sequence. the multiple sequence alignment  and the weblogo graphic representation display the eight conserved motifs characteristic of this family  <cit>  .


all of these ski <dig> family members present c-terminal additional domains that can provide insights into their function . two of them present a domain called sec <dig>  named after the yeast sec <dig> protein   where it was found, and that is required for assembly of functional endoplasmic reticulum translocons  <cit> . another giardia ski <dig> protein exhibits a domain named hhh <dig>  which is frequently found in prokaryotic and eukaryotic non-sequence-specific dna-binding proteins  <cit> . the fourth ski <dig> helicase presents a dshct domain, which is found in dob1/sk12/hely-like helicases  <cit> .

interestingly, gl50803_ <dig> shows an internal repeat , as described for other rna helicases  <cit> . this 2421-amino acid orf consists of two rna helicases joined together, presenting the eight ski <dig> conserved motifs and an additional sec <dig> motif of unknown function at the c-terminal region of each repeat. marchat  <cit>  detected the same patterns in several eukaryotic orthologs proteins and suggested horizontal gene transfer between bacteria and eukaryotes.

dna helicases from other families
as mentioned above, only six of the twelve helicase families are supposed to comprise rna helicases  and the remaining families consist of dna helicases. in giardia we found  <dig> additional orfs that could be considered dna helicases and grouped them into the three following families:

swi2/snf <dig> family
seven orfs were linked to this family based on the sequence features and compared with members of this family belonging to other species. they present the eight characteristic motifs, with the sequence conservation being represented in the logos under the alignment . this family is one of the largest helicase families in g. lamblia sf <dig>  with an average length of  <dig>  amino acids . the n- and c-terminal regions present characteristic domains; almost all of them show one or two snf2n domains that were described as the atpase component of the snf2/swi multi-subunit complex, disrupting histone-dna interactions. other domains found within these orfs were the sant domain, the bromo domain and a chromo domain.

recq family
this is the smallest family, with only three members found in the giardia genome. these helicases also have one of the smallest average lengths, with only the central hcd. the eight characteristic motifs that defined this family are highly conserved, as shown in additional file 9: figure s <dig>  the three orfs share the greatest homology with the blm  gene from humans, which is believed to act by suppressing inappropriate recombination  <cit> . they are also homolog for the yeast sgs <dig> gene, a nucleolar dna helicase of the recq family involved in genome integrity  <cit> .

rad <dig> family
this family is composed of four members in g. lamblia. it presents the largest hcd of all the sf <dig> helicases due to the presence of a differently large linker region between the dexdc and the helicc domains. they present homology in all the eight conserved motifs, except for orf gl50803_ <dig>  which lacks motifs ia and ib . this orf presents no significant similarity to human proteins; however, it was included in this family based on results of sequence and multiple alignment analyses .

the helicase core domain within the dicer sequence
the hcd is an important component of higher eukaryotes’ dicer enzymes, and is involved in some functions regarding the fundamental participation of this protein in rnai  <cit> . as a deep-branching eukaryote, a database search using the entire giardia dicer amino acid sequence returned a list of ribonuclease iii  containing regions that belong to different species of bacteria with the highest alignment scores. interestingly, these prokaryotic sequences of about 220- <dig> amino acids only possess one ribonuclease iii domain and one double-stranded rna binding motif  .


in the search of protozoa homologs containing the hcd within the dicer sequence, we performed a blastp against the protozoa genomic database available at the ncbi with the entire giardia dicer sequence. we obtained the highest score with polysphondylium pallidum, which contains only an amino-terminal dsrm domain and two c-terminal riboc domains. the other five protozoa with the highest scores against giardia dicer protein present different domains, as shown in figure 4–a. the homologies were located only at the c-terminal region, spanning the two conserved riboc domains together with the paz domain. interestingly, one of these homologs from naegleria gruberi presents all the conserved domains, being also the protozoa protein with the highest sequence similarity to human dicer <dig> . remarkably, the hcd of this protozoan enzyme have low homology with any putative rna helicases found in giardia, as is also the case for the well-conserved helicase domain within other higher eukaryotes dicer proteins used to search the giardia genome database.

using the dicer-like  <dig>  protein sequence from arabidopsis thaliana, we searched the protozoan database for other dicer-like proteins that could have the hcd together with the ribonuclease iii domains. noticeably, besides the n. gruberi putative protein containing all the dicer conserved domains, other protozoan homologs that have at least these two domains are ectocarpus siliculosus, tetrahymena thermophila, paramecium tetraurelia, and perkinsus marinus . these molecules do not present all dicer domains and, in some cases, they only show one ribonuclease iii domain instead of two. additionally, by taking only the hcd of these protozoa proteins and performing a blastp against the giardia assemblage a isolate wb database, we did not find any significant homology with the described putative rna helicases. even when we generate a profile sequence from these five protozoan  and performed a more sensitive psi-blast , the giardia sequences presented low homology and corresponded to helicases already described in this work.

we also used eight dicer sequences from higher eukaryotes , all of them presenting a helicase domain and almost all the others dicer specific domains . considering only their hcd, we created a consensus sequence of  <dig> amino acids. a psi-blast analysis  of the g. lamblia database using this consensus sequence give us  <dig> putative helicases already described and classified in this work. the best e-value was for the dead-box putative helicase gl50803_ <dig>  with query coverage of only the 30%. to analyze the presence of patterns conserved in sets within this eight helicase domains, we performed a pattern matching using the pratt software  <cit> . we obtained a series of best sets and subsets patterns that could be divided into four groups, two in the dexdc domain, one in the helicc domain and one in the region within this two. these four patterns were used again to search the giardia database. first, we created a consensus sequence for each one of these patterns and used it to perform a psi-blast analysis . only with the best pattern, corresponding to the helicc domain, our analysis gave a series of similar sequences, all of them already described as putative helicases. again the putative dead-box helicase gl50803_ <dig> was at the top-five sequences with a 100% query coverage. the other patterns obtained provided no sequences producing significant alignments with e-value better than threshold.

rna helicases relative expression during encystation
based on in vitro experiments, the contribution of several dexd/h-box proteins in the accomplishment of crucial cellular functions has been revealed  <cit> . the fact that the entire life cycle of g. lamblia can be reproduced in vitro makes this species an attractive model to study cellular differentiation  <cit> . we analyzed the expression of all the dexd/h-box helicases genes by quantitative pcr  , to explore the participation of these genes during the encystation process. the relative expression of these genes was determined in trophozoites under normal proliferating conditions, and in those induced to encyst after incubation for  <dig> hours in encystation medium, as described in materials and methods. of a set of thirty one genes studied, we found eight whose expression did not change during encystation, five from the dead-box family, two from the deah-box family and one from the ski2-like family. we also found down-regulation of one gene from the deah-box family after induction of trophozoites differentiation into cysts. in addition, we found twenty two genes that were up-regulated during encystation, seventeen from dead-box family, three from the deah-box family and two from the ski2-like family . the encystation process was confirmed in these samples by analyzing the expression of a developmentally-regulated molecule  <cit>  by western blotting using a specific anti-cwp <dig>  monoclonal antibody .


comparing the up-regulated genes reported in the sage  data  <cit>   we found some correlation  with the dead-box family;  with the deah-box family and  with the ski2-like family . the orf gl50803_ <dig> was not included in the graph because the percentage of the sense tags was almost  <dig> times the percentage of the others orfs in this study, but up-regulation of this gene correlated with the qpcr determination. this comparison between the qpcr results and the sage data should be taken with caution, as the induction protocols and the time points considered are not directly comparable. one explanation for the low agreement between the two methods is that encystation is poorly synchronic  <cit> . another possible reason, as previously described for the validation process between two different methods of gene expression determination  <cit> , is that these analyses have inherent pitfalls that may significantly influence the data obtained for each method and, in general, those genes showing small degrees of change also present lower correlations  <cit> . we were not able to determine the correlation of the down-regulated orf gl50803_ <dig> or of the up-regulated orf gl50803_ <dig> because there is no determination in the sage data, probably they are among the  <dig>  unassigned sage tags  <cit> . we could not find also sense tag determination in the sage data for the orf gl50803_ <dig>  taking in account the postulate that encystation genes can be divided into specific and up-regulated after induction  <cit> , we assume that the twenty two putative rna helicases genes with high relative expression described here would fall into the latter group.

rna helicase relative expression during antigenic variation
antigenic variation was induced on a unique vsp-expressing giardia clone. the primers used for these determinations were the same as those used for the study of the encystation process. we also designed two additional pairs of primers to determine the relative expression of giardia dicer and argonaute  transcripts. the relative expression from the thirty one giardia putative rna helicases was divided into earlier  and later  up-regulated or down-regulated transcripts. eight putative rna helicases were up-regulated after antigenic variation induction, three of them earlier and five later. on the other hand, eight putative rna helicases were down-regulated, five after early induction and three later .


a more detailed analysis of the relative expression of the eight putative rna helicases that were up-regulated after antigenic variation induction showed a slight induction ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  times. in addition, two transcripts from the early up-regulation maintain induction after 3- <dig> hours. the eight down-regulated putative rna helicases presented strong down-regulation earlier and significant down-regulation later during antigenic variation. two of the five early down-regulated rna helicases maintained low levels of expression after 3- <dig> h, while one of them was up regulated later. the three transcripts that were down-regulated later presented no significant variations at  <dig> min- <dig> h . the relative expression of gdicer presented an early up-regulation that is maintained at later times, while giardia ago presented a later up-regulation after 3- <dig> post induction of antigenic variation .

based on our results from the qpcr experiments, we searched the giardia database for highly homologs to well known rna helicases already described participating in the rnai process in higher eukaryotes. we found that the human deah-box helicase rha , described in remodeling risc to allow dsrna loading onto this complex  <cit> , has a high homology with the g. lamblia deah-box helicase gl50803_ <dig>  which presents a later up-regulation during antigenic variation, in agreement with the giardia ago expression . another g. lamblia deah-box helicase found to have high homology with the hsrha is gl50803_ <dig>  which also presents a delayed up-regulation after induction of antigenic variation. interestingly, a giardia putative rna helicase that presented an early up-regulation that was maintained for 3– <dig> h after antigenic variation induction is gl50803_ <dig>  which has a great homology with the human ddx <dig> helicase , a protein that interacts with ago <dig> in affinity-purified risc assemblies to facilitate formation of cytoplasmic p-bodies and that acts as a general translational repressor in human cells  <cit> .

other bona fide rnai component in d. melanogaster s <dig> cells is the belle  dead-box rna helicase that seems to be important to both pathways . our search found that the g. lamblia putative dead-box helicase gl50803_ <dig> present the highest homology with this drosophila helicase described acting downstream of the dsrna loading onto the risc. our qpcr data shows that even when the giardia putative helicase gl50803_ <dig> presented an early down-regulation, their mrna levels increased at 3– <dig> hs after the antigenic variation induction. the g. lamblia dead-box helicase gl50803_ <dig> was also found to have a high homology with two other rna helicases described participating in the rnai pathway. this two related dead-box rna helicases  were found to associate with a complex containing drosha and required for processing of mirna in mice  <cit> .

western blotting from total protein of the different samples and times analyzed by qpcr in the antigenic variation experiment showed that the level of the specific vsp protein do not change . under these experiments conditions, a change in vsp protein expression was detected by immunofluorescence assays after  <dig> h. since our intention was to determine the early participation of some putative helicases during this specific giardia adaptation process, we performed qpcr reactions only at very short times , where the changes at the protein level for vsps cannot be detected. although there was no vsp change at these times, we were able to detect specific up regulated expression of dicer and ago transcripts, two essential enzymes already related with this process  <cit> . importantly, dicer expression was up regulated at very short times and was maintained for hours, while gago expression raised at later times, in accordance with their roles in the rnai process  <cit> . although there is an incomplete understanding of how rna helicases are regulated, it is possible that they operate at different steps of the rnai pathway or performing different roles  <cit> .

discussion
as shown in several studies, rna helicases are involved in a wide variety of processes, some of them being essential for survival, as demonstrated for the yeast putative rna helicases, where their knockouts were lethal  <cit> . these results are essential for the correct annotation of the giardia genome, since many of the helicases identified in this study were automatically annotated either as helicases without indicating any further information and others just as hypothetical proteins .

the genome of a number of organisms contains a large number of putative helicases  <cit>  and, as we found in this work, the relationship between the number of dead-box and dexh-box rna helicases is conserved in giardia as it is has been reported for other organisms . although giardia is considered as an early-branching eukaryote and has a smaller and more compact genome  <cit> , our findings regarding the type and number of rna helicases in giardia highlight the importance of these molecules in the biology of eukaryotic cells.

since only a few dexd/h-box rna helicases have been characterized biochemically, most of the reports assigning a putative function are based on the presence of the conserved and characteristic motifs that can define a putative rna helicase and its family. here we used the presence of those motifs for classification performing an in silico approach and then by manual identification of each motif. then we confirmed and refined each motif at each position. our results were in agreement with the phylogenetic tree obtained, because sf <dig> helicases were grouped specifically according to their sequence conservation as well as with the conservation of their motifs.

the particular finding within the giardia ski <dig> family regarding the internal duplication of the orf gl50803_ <dig>  having two helicases and sec <dig> domains, probably indicates that the origin of this protein was by a fusion event of two ancestral prokaryotic genes, as proposed for the rna helicases from entamoeba histolytica ehdexh <dig> and ehdexh <dig>  <cit>  and other homologous proteins from phylogenetically distant species. unfortunately, the significance of this duplication found only in two early-branching parasitic intestinal protozoa is still unknown.

the dead-box protein family is present in many organisms, being the major rna family of helicases, which seem to be involved in many, if not all, steps of rna metabolism  <cit> . although some dead-box helicases are closely related and have been described as paralogs  <cit> , the comparison among amino acid sequences of all full-length sequences showed no paralogous dead-box helicases in giardia because these proteins only share 14–29% identity and 24–43% similarity.

regarding giardia differentiation into cysts, it is known that encystation comprises the formation of a resistant cyst wall that allows the parasite to survive under hostile external environmental conditions and guarantees the transmission of the infection to susceptible hosts  <cit> . several encystation-specific genes have been identified and characterized during the last decade, and have shown to be up-regulated with similar kinetics during encystation, suggesting that their regulation is at the transcriptional level  <cit> . several reports also described putative transcription factors that regulate the expression of encystation-specific genes  <cit> . it was assumed that the encystation process is controlled at multiple levels   <cit> . moreover, it was hypothesized that epigenetic chromatin modifications via histone acetylation/deacetylation may participate in modulation of stage differentiation in this parasite  <cit> . in higher organisms, different rna helicases have been described to interact with histone deacetylases , such as the known transcriptional regulator dp <dig> , which was found to immunoprecipitate with histone deacetylases hdac <dig> and hdac <dig>  suggesting a role in transcription repression through hdacs recruitment  <cit> . in addition, the role of the rna helicases p <dig>  and p <dig>  as transcription repressors when interacting with hdac <dig>  <cit> , hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> has been reported  <cit> . our findings regarding the levels of induction of the rna helicase genes by qpcr were diverse, ranging from a smooth 2-4-fold induction in some dead-box genes to a high  relative expression in other genes. two genes, dead-box gl50803_ <dig> and deah-box gl50803_ <dig>  presented a marked induction of  <dig> and  <dig> times, respectively, under the encystation conditions. notably, the up-regulation of the encystation-specific gene coding for cwp <dig> increased up to  <dig>  times compared to its expression in trophozoites.

in giardia, the rnai machinery controlling antigenic variation has been found to involve a dicer enzyme with unique characteristics when compared to dicer enzymes from higher eukaryotes. giardia dicer lacks the dexd/h helicase domain as well as double-stranded rna binding motifs present in other dicer homologs. because we are only starting to understand the different roles of rna helicases in rnai, there are still many unresolved questions. since different rna helicases might operate at different steps in the rnai pathway or might play different roles, the presence of thirty two putative dexd/h-box helicases in the giardia genome and their differential patterns of expression during antigenic variation support their importance for rnai. it would be relevant to determine the role of particular giardia rna helicases for different subsets of mirna or sirnas. however, it is already clear that the presence of a rna helicase activity  is necessary for the correct functioning at different steps of the rnai pathway. as it was proposed in several reports, there are a number of potential roles for rna helicases in rnai  <cit> . our findings in the qpcr experiments during antigenic variation suggest that rna helicases may participate in rnai. this could be the case of the g. lamblia putative dead-box helicase gl50803_ <dig>  which was found to present high homology with the dmbel helicase and also with the dead-box rna helicases p <dig> and p <dig>  taking into account that some studies pointed out extensive overlapping and interplay among small rna directed silencing machineries  <cit>  and different rna helicases operate either at different steps or playing different roles in the rnai pathway, the involvement of this g. lamblia rna helicase  in post-transcriptional gene silencing deserve further analysis.

although we did not find a putative helicase in giardia with high similarity to the hcd of higher eukaryotes dicer enzyme, it has been proposed that dicer helicase domain is required for sirna, but not mirna, processing  <cit> . point mutations within the helicase domain or dicer lacking a functional hcd showed that pre-mirna processing does not require helicase participation, but that it is necessary for long dsrna   <cit> .

in giardia, we have demonstrated that purified rdrp generates high-molecular-weight vsp rnas in vitro only when more than one vsp transcript is present in the reaction mixture  <cit>  and proposed a mechanism where variations in either the general or local concentrations of different vsp transcripts may determine which transcript will circumvent the silencing system, as was suggested to occur in higher eukaryotes  <cit> . in addition, it has been proposed by others groups the presence in giardia of a mirna biogenesis pathway reminiscent of the canonical mirna biogenesis pathway found in higher organisms  <cit> , and they have identified conserved putative microrna target site of several variant surface protein  mrnas. here giardia dicer apparently would assume the functions of both a drosha and a dicer, although no rna-binding protein dawdle  homolog has yet been identified in this parasite. furthermore giardia dicer must shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus to process pri- and pre-mirnas, although we determined its cellular localization by expressing a hemagglutinin-tagged version of the protein. similar to that observed in other cells, giardia dicer localizes to the cytoplasm  <cit> .

on one hand, the lack of the rna helicase domain in giardia dicer is in agreement with the occurrence of a mirna pathway. but, on the other hand, it was also proposed that a deletion or mutation of the helicase domain of human dicer leads to a more active enzyme in vitro for cleavage of a perfectly matched 37-nt linear duplex rna  <cit> , allowing the enzyme to rapidly reinitiate cleavage on the long substrates. this last being the case for the generation of perfectly matched vsp dsrnas by rdrp and subsequent degradation  <cit> . it is also important to highlight that the lack of the helicase domain was proposed to increase the effectiveness of long hairpins for intracellular applications in which multiple sirnas are desired, as could be the case for vsp mrna degradation. interestingly, gdicer without the rna helicase domain can complement the absence of the entire dicer in s. pombe <cit> . the lack of the rna helicase domain in giardia dicer or, in other words, the inclusion of the rna helicase domain in dicer enzymes of higher eukaryotes, raises new questions about the function of this domain in dicer activity and regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
the first in silico classification of sf <dig> g. lamblia helicases was achieved, describing some of their features, organization, structure, and homology to helicases from humans and yeast. a series of up- and down-regulated putative rna helicases were found during encystation and antigenic variation, suggesting their participation in both adaptative processes. most of them are assumed to be up-regulated after induction to encystation, while in the antigenic variation process we infer that the regulated rna helicases studied may operate at different steps of the rnai pathway, even when no putative helicase in giardia presented high similarity to the hcd of higher eukaryotes dicer enzymes.
