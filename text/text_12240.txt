BACKGROUND
nematodes  are an extremely diverse group of bilateral animals with an estimate of 1– <dig> million species although only ~ <dig>  species have been described  <cit> . nematode taxonomy has traditionally been formed from morphology and ecology, e.g. the early systems proposed by schneider   <cit>  on somatic musculature and by cobb   <cit>  on stoma armature, and the system proposed by filipjev   <cit>  on the presence and absence of zooparasitism. chitwood   <cit>  proposed initially the bipartite phylogenetic and taxonomic system based on the presence and absence of phasmids; this system was further elaborated later by maggenti   <cit>  based on pharyngeal structure and excretory systems. however, due to the lack of homologous characters and informative fossil records, and the extensive convergent evolution, it has been extremely difficult to derive a consistent phylogenetic and taxonomic framework for the phylum nematoda from morphological and ecological characters  <cit> . in the past two decades, nematode phylogeny and taxonomy have been revised with analyses of the nuclear small subunit  rrna gene sequences  <cit> . the current working hypothesis of nematoda phylogeny incorporated evidence from morphology, ecology and ssu rrna gene sequence analyses  <cit> .

the mitochondrial  genomes of bilateral animals usually contain  <dig> genes and a control region on a circular chromosome, ~16 kb in size  <cit> . sequences of individual mt genes and whole mt genomes are widely used to infer phylogenetic relationships among animals at different taxonomic levels  <cit> . in a number of cases, arrangement of mt genes has also been used to resolve long-standing phylogenetic relationships that could not be resolved by other means  <cit> .

recently, mt genome sequences have also been analyzed to understand the phylogenetic relationships among nematodes. kang et al.  <cit>  inferred the nematoda phylogeny with the mt genome sequences of  <dig> species; park et al.  <cit>  and sultana et al.  <cit>  expanded further the analysis to include  <dig> and  <dig> species respectively. a major difference between mt genome phylogenies and the current working hypothesis of the nematoda is on the relationship among four infraorders: ascaridomorpha, rhabditomorpha, spiruromorpha and oxyuridomorpha. in the current working hypothesis, ascaridomorpha, spiruromorpha and oxyuridomorpha are in the suborder spirurina whereas rhabditomorpha is in the suborder rhabditina  <cit> . furthermore, ascaridomorpha is most closely related to spiruromorpha, whereas oxyuridomorpha is sister to ascaridomorpha + spiruromorpha + rhigonematomorph. in the phylogenies inferred from mt genome sequences, however, ascaridomorpha is most closely related to rhabditomorpha; in most analyses, oxyuridomorpha is sister to ascaridomorpha + rhabditomorpha, whereas spiruromorpha is sister to the group that contains ascaridomorpha, rhabditomorpha and oxyuridomorpha  <cit> . due to limited taxon sampling, however, the novel phylogenetic relationships inferred from mt genome sequences in these studies need to be interpreted with caution and further test with more taxa from a wide range of lineages is necessary.

in this study, we sequenced the complete mt genomes of three ascaridia species in the family ascaridiidae of the infraorder ascaridomorpha. ascaridia species are among the most prevalent and pathogenic parasitic nematodes found in domestic and wild birds and have a worldwide distribution  <cit> . these ascaridia species share an identical arrangement of mt genes to each other but differ substantially from those of other nematodes. we inferred the phylogenetic relationships with the complete mt genome sequences of the ascaridia species and  <dig> other nematode species that have been sequenced to date. our analyses support the close relationship between ascaridomorpha and rhabditomorpha, and provide novel insights into other phylogenetic relationships in the nematoda.

RESULTS
mitochondrial genomes of three ascaridia species
the complete mt genomes of a. galli, a. columbae and ascaridia sp.  were  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp long, respectively . each mt genome contains  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> trna genes and two rrna genes on a circular chromosome . as in most other nematodes, atp <dig> gene is not present in the mt genome of a. galli, a. columbae and ascaridia sp. ; all mt genes are transcribed from the same direction. ttt is used as the initiation codon in nad <dig> gene in the mt genome of a. galli. ttt was previously reported to be the initiation codon for cox <dig>  cytb, nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig> and cox <dig> genes in the mt genome of strongyloides stercoralis , but not for any other ascaridida nematodes. all of the  <dig> protein-coding genes have complete termination codons, taa or tag. the trna genes in mt genomes of a. galli, a. columbae and ascaridia sp.  range from  <dig> to 76 bp. the trna-ser and trna-ser have truncated secondary structures; these two trnas lack a dhu stem but possess a tΨc loop. in all other  <dig> trna genes, the tΨc arm and variable loop are replaced with a tv replacement loop. there are two non-coding regions  in the mt genomes of a. galli, a. columbae and ascaridia sp.  . the longer ncr  is between trnc gene and trnn gene, and is 610 bp , 563 bp  and 566 bp  respectively. the shorter ncr  is between nad <dig> and trnm gene, and is 157 bp , 91 bp  and 101 bp  respectively. a ncr at this location, i.e. between nad <dig> and trnm, is also present in the mt genomes of most other nematodes  <cit> .

gene rearrangement in the mitochondrial genomes of ascaridia species
a. galli, a. columbae and ascaridia sp.  have an identical gene arrangement in their mt genomes. the arrangement of mt genes in these three species, however, is substantially different from those of other nematodes . the mt genomes of the  <dig> species of nematodes that have been sequenced to date showed  <dig> types of gene arrangements , of which ga <dig> is the most common type and has been found in  <dig> species of nematodes. in comparison to the ga <dig> type, at least three rearrangement events occurred in the ascaridia species: trnm was translocated, and a block of  <dig> genes  swapped position with another block of  <dig> genes  .

phylogeny of nematodes inferred from mitochondrial genome sequences
monophylies of the order rhabditida and the subclass dorylaimia
of the  <dig> species of nematodes included in the phylogenetic analyses in this study,  <dig> species were from the order rhabditida of the class chromadorea, and  <dig> species were from the subclass dorylaimia of the class enoplea. both rhabditida and dorylaimia were monophyletic in all of the trees inferred with bayesian, ml and mp methods from concatenated amino acid sequences deduced from the sequences of the  <dig> mt protein-coding genes. the monophyly of the order rhabditida was strongly supported with a posterior probability  of  <dig> in bayesian analysis , a bootstrapping frequency  of 100% in ml analysis , and a bf of 94% in mp analysis . the monophyly of the subclass dorylaimia was strongly supported in bayesian and ml analyses , and was moderately supported in mp analysis .

phylogenetic relationships within the order rhabditida
the  <dig> species of nematodes in the order rhabditida included in this study were from three suborders: rhabditina , spirurina , and tylenchina . the monophyly of the suborder rhabditina was strongly supported in bayesian and ml analyses , and was moderately supported in mp analysis . the spirurina and the tylenchina, however, were not monophyletic in all of the three phylogenetic analyses in this study.

of the  <dig> species from the suborder rhabditina,  <dig> species were from the infraorder rhabditomorpha and one species from the infraorder diplogasteromorpha. species of these two infraorders were most closely related in all of the phylogenetic analyses in this study. the rhabditomorpha, however, was paraphyletic with respect to the diplogasteromorpha. three species from the superfamily rhabitoidea of the rhabditomorpha were more closely related to pristionchus pacificus  than they were to the other  <dig> species from the rhabditomorpha. the close relationship between the species of the superfamily rhabitoidea and p. pacificus was strongly supported in bayesian analysis , and was moderately supported in ml and mp analyses . in addition to the rhabitoidea, three other superfamilies of the infraorder rhabditomorpha were also represented in our analyses: ancylostomatoidea , strongyloidea , and trichostrongyloidea . the trichostrongyloidea was monophyletic with strong support in all of the three phylogenetic analyses in this study . the rhabitoidea was monophyletic with strong support in bayesian analysis  and weak support in mp analysis , but was paraphyletic in ml analysis with weak support . the ancylostomatoidea and the strongyloidea were paraphyletic in all of the three phylogenetic analyses in this study; there was strong support for the paraphylies of these two superfamilies in bayesian and mp analyses .

the  <dig> species of the suborder spirurina included in this study were from three infraorders: ascaridomorpha , oxyuridomorpha  and spiruromorpha . the oxyuridomorpha and the spiruromorpha were both monophyletic with strong support in all of the three phylogenetic analyses . the ascaridomorpha, however, was monophyletic only in ml analysis with moderate support , and was paraphyletic in bayesian analysis with strong support  and mp analysis with weak support . in both bayesian and mp analyses, the  <dig> species of the superfamily ascarodoidea of the infraorder ascaridomorpha were more closely related to those of the rhabditina and steinernema carpocapsae  than they were to the three ascaridia species and cucullanus robustus, which were also from the infraorder ascaridomorpha. the three ascaridia species, for which mt genomes were sequenced in this study, form a monoplyletic group with strong support in all of the three phylogenetic analyses . cucullanus robustus was sister to ascaridomorpha + rhabditina + steinernema carpocapsae in bayesian analysis with strong support . cucullanus robustus, however, was sister the ascaridia species with moderate support in ml analysis  and weak support in mp analysis .

the four species of the suborder tylenchina included in this study were from two infraorders: panagrolaimorpha , and tylenchomorpha . both of these infraorders were paraphyletic in all of the three analyses .

phylogenetic relationships within the subclass dorylaimia
the  <dig> species of the subclass dorylaimia included in this study were from three orders: mermithida , dorylaimida , and trichinellida . the mermitida and the trichinellida were both monophyletic with strong support in all of the three analyses . among the three orders, the mermithida and the dorylaimida were more closely related than either of them to the trichocephalida, with strong support in bayesian analysis  and moderate support in ml analysis . the dorylaimida was grouped with the trichocephalida in mp analysis but the support to this grouping was weak .

discussion
phylogenetic relationships among nematodes have been revised in the past two decades using sequences of nuclear small subunit  rrna gene  <cit> . the current working hypothesis of nematoda phylogeny incorporated evidence from both morphology, ecology and nuclear ssu rrna gene sequence analyses  <cit> . recently, kang et al.  <cit>  tested the hypothesis of the nematoda phylogeny with the mt genome sequences of  <dig> species. kang et al.  <cit>  showed strong support to the monophyly of the class chromadorea, represented by  <dig> species from the order rhabditida; this study, however, could not establish the monophyly of the class enoplea, represented by nine species from the subclass dorylaimia. park et al.  <cit>  and sultana et al.  <cit>  expanded the taxon sampling and inferred phylogenies with mt genome sequences of  <dig> and  <dig> species of nematodes respectively. park et al.  <cit>  showed strong support for the monophylies of both chromadorea and enoplea. sultana et al.  <cit> , however, could not establish the monophyly of the class enoplea in most of their analyses. a major difference between the mt genome phylogenies and the current working hypothesis of the nematode phylogeny is on the monophyly of the suborder spirurina, which includes clade iii nematodes proposed in blaxter et al.  <cit> . in the current working hypothesis, the suborder spirurina is monophyletic, which includes the infraorders ascaridomorpha, spiruromorpha and oxyuridomorpha, whereas the infraorder rhabditomorpha is in the suborder rhabditina  <cit> . further, ascaridomorpha is most closely related to spiruromorpha, whereas oxyuridomorpha is sister to the group that includes ascaridomorpha + spiruromorpha. in the phylogenies inferred from mt genome sequences, however, ascaridomorpha is most closely related to rhabditomorpha; in most analyses, oxyuridomorpha is sister to ascaridomorpha + rhabditomorpha, whereas spiruromorpha is sister to the group that contains ascaridomorpha, rhabditomorpha and oxyuridomorpha. kang et al.  <cit> , park et al.  <cit>  and sultana et al.  <cit>  contained much less taxa compared to previous phylogenetic studies on nematodes with nuclear ssu rrna gene sequences . the novel phylogenetic relationship inferred from mt genome sequences, thus, needs to be tested further with more taxa from a wide range of nematode lineages.

in the present study, we sequenced the complete mt genomes of three ascaridia species from the family ascaridiidae of the superfamily heterakoidea, which was not represented in previous studies . furthermore, we inferred the phylogenetic relationships among  <dig> nematode species, for which complete mt genomes have been sequenced to date. our analyses support the division of nematodes into two classes, chromadorea and enoplea, represented by the order rhabditida and the subclass dorylaimia, respectively, in the present study. both the rhabditida and the dorylaimia were monophyletic with strong support, regardless the methods of phylogenetic analysis used. within the order rhabditida, the suborder rhabditina was monophyletic; the other two suborders, spirurina and tylenchina, however, were both paraphyletic in all of the three phylogenetic analyses in this study. monophyly of the suborder spirurina was well supported in nuclear ssu rrna gene sequence analyses  <cit> , but was rejected in mt genome sequence analyses in kang et al.  <cit> , park et al.  <cit> , sultana et al.  <cit>  and the present study. phylogenetic analyses of mt genome sequences in all of these four studies support strongly a close relationship between ascaridomorpha and rhabditomorpha to the exclusion of oxyuridomorpha and spiruromorpha. apparently, additional markers for phylogenetic inference are required to resolve the controversy on the spirurina between mt genome sequence phylogeny and nuclear ssu rrna phylogeny.

gene arrangement in mt genomes provides a source of information for phylogenetic inference, independent from mt genome sequences  <cit> . it is noteworthy that  <dig> species of ascaridomorpha and  <dig> species of rhabditomorpha included in our phylogenetic analyses share a common pattern of gene arrangement, ga <dig>  in their mt genomes . ga <dig> is also present in pristionchus pacificus, the only species from the infraorder diplogasteromorpha, which is closely related to the species from the superfamily rhabitoidea of the rhabditomorpha . indeed, ga <dig> is the most common pattern of mt gene arrangement observed in nematodes to date; nevertheless, this pattern is present only in species of the ascaridomorpha, the rhabditomorpha and the diplogasteromorpha. the possibility that ga <dig> is ancestral to the phylum nematoda can be rejected with confidence thanks to the discovery of mt gene arrangement pattern ga <dig> in three trichinellida species  <cit> . ga <dig> shares obvious similarity with that of many arthropods and would resemble the ancestral pattern of mt gene arrangement of the phylum nematoda more than any other patterns found in the nematodes. there is no evidence either that ga <dig> is ancestral to the class chromadorea. given the strong support to the close relationship between ascaridomorpha and rhabditomorpha + diplogasteromorpha indicated by mt genome sequence analyses in the present study, the most parsimonious explanation is that ga <dig> is a shared derived character  of the clade ascaridomorpha + rhabditomorpha + diplogasteromorpha. the other six patterns, ga <dig>  ga <dig>  ga <dig>  ga <dig>  ga <dig> and ga <dig>  observed in either ascaridomorpha and rhabditomorpha or in species closely related to these two infraorders, can be derived from ga <dig> by only a few rearrangement events , e.g. ga <dig>  observed in the three ascaridia species, can be converted from ga <dig> by three rearrangement events .

monophyly of the suborder tylenchina could not be established previously in nuclear ssu rna gene sequence analyses  <cit> . no species from this suborder were included in two previous analyses of mt genome sequences  <cit> . the present study included four species from the tylenchina and indicated the paraphyly of this suborder. the positions of the four species of the tylenchina change depending on the methods of phylogenetic inference used in this study. for instance, steinernema carpocapsae is sister to the suborder rhabditina in bayesian analysis  and mp analysis ; it is, however, sister to ascaridomorpha + rhabditomorpha + diplogasteromorpha in ml analysis . further test with more species from this suborder apparently is needed in order to clarify the phylogenetic position of the suborder tylenchina. indeed, a very recent study by sultana et al.  <cit>  included six species from the tylenchina and showed the paraphyly of this suborder with strong support. the paraphyly of the infraorder rhabditomorpha with respect to the diplogasteromorpha will also need further test with expanded taxon sampling as only one species, pristionchus pacificus, from the diplogasteromorpha was included in the present study. no species from the subclass enoplia, which has two orders and eight suborders  <cit> , was included in our analyses. for the subclass chromadoria, all of the species included in this study were from the order rhabditida whereas the other five orders, plectida, araeolaimida, monhysterida, desmodorida, and chromadorida, were not represented. expanding taxon sampling from these lineages of nematodes is clearly the next step for phylogenetic studies of nematodes with mt genome sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
we sequenced the complete mt genomes of three ascaridia species  that infest chickens, pigeons and parrots, respectively. these species have an identical arrangement of mt genes to each other but differ substantially from other nematodes. phylogenetic analyses of the mt genome sequences of the ascaridia species, in combination with  <dig> other nematode species, support the monophylies of the subclass dorylaimia; the orders rhabditida, trichinellida and mermithida; the suborder rhabditina; and the infraorders spiruromorpha and oxyuridomorpha. analyses of mt genome sequences, however, reject the monophylies of the suborders spirurina and tylenchina, and the infraorders rhabditomorpha, panagrolaimomorpha and tylenchomorpha. monophyly of the infraorder ascaridomorpha varies depending on the methods of phylogenetic analysis. the ascaridomorpha was more closely related to the infraorders rhabditomorpha and diplogasteromorpha  than they were to the other two infraorders of the spirurina: oxyuridorpha and spiruromorpha. the closer relationship among ascaridomorpha, rhabditomorpha and diplogasteromorpha was also supported by a shared common pattern of mitochondrial gene arrangement. analyses of mitochondrial genome sequences and gene arrangement in the current study and several previous studies have provided novel insights into the phylogenetic relationships among several major lineages of nematodes. many lineages of nematodes, however, are underrepresented or not represented in these analyses. expanding taxon sampling is necessary for future phylogenetic studies of nematodes with mt genome sequences.
