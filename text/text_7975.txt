BACKGROUND
campylobacter is the leading cause of bacterial zoonotic gastroenteritis in both developing and developed countries
 <cit> . it causes  <dig> to  <dig> times more diarrheal cases than salmonella, shigella or e. coli o157:h7
 <cit> . c. jejuni is primarily responsible for human campylobacteriosis. however, the role of c. coli cannot be neglected because many studies from spain and united kingdom have emphasized the importance of c. coli because of its multiple antibiotic resistance property and its ability to cause acquired food borne enteric infections
 <cit> . c. coli contribute about 9% of human campylobacteriosis in usa
 <cit>  and about 7% in england and wales
 <cit> . c. coli cases are even higher than c. jejuni in older people
 <cit>  and in summer
 <cit> . pork is considered to be the major reservoir of c. coli <cit> . various studies have reported c. coli as a potential source of human campylobacteriosis. in the united kingdom, gillespie et al., showed that individuals harboring c. coli infection were more likely to have eaten pork pate than those infected with c. jejuni <cit> . similarly, in a large case control study in the usa, friedman et al.,  <dig> showed the consumption of hamburgers, pork roasts and sausages as an important risk factor for campylobacter infection
 <cit> . most of the researches are concentrated on c. jejuni and less is explored about c. coli <cit> . therefore, this paper focus on prevalence, antibiogram and risk factors associated with c. coli in porcine carcass.

most of the cases of campylobacter infection are self limiting and do not require medication. however, an acute post-infectious ascending paralysis may occur  that is considered most common cause of flaccid paralysis after polio
 <cit> . this condition and severe prolonged infection require treatment. macrolids and fluroquinolones are drugs of choice for treatment of human campylobacteriosis
 <cit> . however, resistance to these groups of antibiotics have been reported from different part of the world
 <cit> . resistance to fluroquinolones in the treatment of severe cases of human campylobacteriosis has risen in usa since 1990
 <cit> .

very few studies have been done in nepal regarding campylobacteriosis. a cohort study was carried out on  <dig> expatriate adults who had lived in nepal for <2 years by shlim et al.,  <dig> to find out the cause of travelers’ diarrhoea among foreigners in nepal
 <cit> . among the causative agents, campylobacter was one of them. he found the annual attack rate of campylobacter as 10%. there are no other available records of human campylobacteriosis in nepal. this is probably because most of the cases of campylobacters go undiagnosed because these cases do not require hospitalization. moreover, the isolation of campylobacter need sophisticated laboratory and is often time and labor consuming. the consumption rate of pork is increasing in nepal and at the same time the butchers and consumers are unaware about this issue. in a study carried out by ghimire et.al.,  <dig>  the condition of pig slaughter slabs was miserable and butchers were unaware about campylobacteriosis
 <cit> . there was high chance of cross-contamination of carcass during slaughtering procedure. so, nepalese might be at high risk and it is essential to estimate the prevalence of campylobacters in pork. antibiotics are widely used in pigs of nepal for therapeutic and prophylactic purpose
 <cit> . nepalese people may be constantly consuming antibiotic resistant campylobacters through pork meat. so, this study is done to determine prevalence, antibiogram and risk factors of campylobacter spp. in dressed porcine carcass of chitwan district.

methods
this cross-sectional study was conducted from september  <dig> to january  <dig> 

questionnaire and survey
a set of semi-structured comprehensive questionnaire was developed focusing on i) condition of water, ii) sanitization of equipments, iii) slaughterhouse practices and condition, and iv) contamination of carcass with intestinal content. all of the slaughter slabs and retail pork meat shops in chitwan were visited and butchers were interviewed.

sample collection
there are  <dig> slaughter slabs and  <dig> retail pork meat shops in chitwan district. altogether  <dig> pooled samples of pork meat  were collected aseptically from all of these slaughter slabs and retail pork shops in uv sterilized plastic zipped bags and transported immediately to veterinary microbiology laboratory of the iaas, rampur in ice cooled box for further processing.

bacterial culture
isolation and identification of thermophilic campylobacter spp. was done according to oie terrestrial manual  <dig>  chapter  <dig> . <dig>  the collected samples were immediately processed without storage. about  <dig> gm of each samples were mixed with 90 ml  <dig> % buffered peptone water   and homogenized manually for pre-enrichment. one volume of homogenized fluid was added to nine volume of bolton broth  for enrichment and then subjected to incubation in microaerophilic atmosphere obtained by burning candle in candle jar  at 37°c for 5 hours and then at 42°c for next 43 hours.

following incubation, one loopful of broth culture was streaked on modified ccda  and incubated at 42°c in a microaerophilic atmosphere for 48 hrs in candle jar. when suspected colonies were detected, confirmatory tests including gram,s stain, growth at 25°c, oxidase and catalase tests, sensitivity to nalidixic acid and cephalothin and hippurate hydrolysis were performed.

antibiogram of the isolated species
antibiogram of identified campylobacter spp. was evaluated against nine different antibiotics  by disc diffusion method following clsi guidelines. platinum loop was used to pick pure campylobacter spp. colonies from the mccda plates and turbid suspension was made by emulsifying colonial growth in bhi broth. the turbidity of the inoculums was adjusted to the equivalent turbidity of  <dig>  mcfarland standards and the broth was incubated in microphilic condition for 48 hours in anaerobic jar with lighting candle.

after incubation, 100 μl of brain heart infusion broth  was dispersed over the surface of a mueller hinton agar   with 5% defibrinated sheep blood to produce a lawn of confluent of bacteria on the surface of agar. using sterile tweezers, antimicrobial discs were placed widely spaced aseptically on the surface of mha plate. tweezers were reflamed after application of each disc. the plates were then incubated in microaerophilic condition at 37°c for 24 hours.

following incubation, the diameter of zone of inhibition was recorded to nearest millimeters for each discs used and then classified as sensitive, intermediate and resistant based on the criteria of huysmans and turnidge,  <dig> for ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline and for other antimicrobial disc used, clsi guideline for enterobacteriaceae was followed. multiple antibiotic resistance  was calculated by dividing the total number of antibiotics used by number of antibiotics resistant to particular isolates
 <cit> . in this study,  <dig> antibiotics were used and are represented as , while number of antibiotics resistant to particular isolate is as e.g.  <dig> . mar is calculated as a/b, which means that in this particular case, mar is 4/9 =  <dig> .

statistical analysis
data entry, management and analysis was done using program microsoft office excel  <dig>  the association between different risk factors and the antibiotics resistivity pattern of isolated campylobacters were compared statistically by a chi-square  analysis using commercial software phstat <dig> version  <dig>  and fisher exact test with significance level defined at the p <  <dig> . the diameter of zone of inhibition of different antibiotics was compared by using t-test: two samples assuming equal variances.

RESULTS
the prevalence rate was found to be  <dig> % . among the isolates,  <dig>  were campylobacter coli and  <dig>  were campylobacter jejuni. the prevalence rate in male and female carcass is  <dig> %  and 41%  respectively. the sex-wise prevalence was statistically non-significant .

discussion
campylobacters are regarded as important food borne pathogens. in this study, we found the prevalence of campylobacter spp. in pork meat of  <dig> %. this is higher than that previously found in new zealand 
 <cit>  and italy 
 <cit> , similar to that reported in one  <dig> us study 
 <cit> , but lower than more recent us study of dressed rib meat 
 <cit>  at us. it is also significantly lower than the prevalence rate of 67% found in slaughtered pigs in tanzania
 <cit> .

these differences may be due to slaughtering practices, antibiotic usage, or intrinsic carriage rates. some of the differences in prevalence rates may also reflect differences in methods used to culture the campylobacter.

this study has also shown higher prevalence rate of c. coli than that of c. jejuni in pork which is supported by many other research like von alrock et al. in  <dig> 
 <cit>  and jonker in  <dig> 
 <cit> .

several studies have shown the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance among campylobacter isolates
 <cit> . most of the isolates in this study  showed resistance towards ampicillin and erythromycin. this finding is similar to the findings of other investigators in spain 
 <cit>  and denmark 
 <cit> . in a study carried out in  <dig> in south africa, uaboi-egbenni et al. reported 100% resistance in one farm and 50% resistance in another farm for c. jejuni from pig towards erythromycin
 <cit> . in the same study, he reported the resistivity of 100% for c. coli in one farm and 64% resistance in another farm towards ampicillin.

tetracycline showed significant difference in the resistivity pattern between c. coli and c. jejuni. this finding is in agreement with the findings of mattheus et al. in 2012
 <cit> . the resistivity pattern of c. coli in this study is in line with sato et al. and thakur et al. in  <dig> and  <dig> respectively
 <cit> . some researchers have shown higher resistivity of tetracycline
 <cit> . nalidixic acid showed significant difference in the resistivity pattern between c. coli and c. jejuni . similar to this finding, mattheus et al. reported the resistivity upto  <dig> % in c. coli from pigs of belgium however, he showed decreasing trend of resistivity since 2005
 <cit> .

c. jejuni showed higher resistivity  than c. coli  for ciprofloxacin with  <dig> % overall resistivity. the result of this study is in line with gallay et al. in pigs of france
 <cit> . similarly, uaboi-egbenni et al. observed 40% resistance in one of the pig farm in south africa in 2011
 <cit>  and mattheus et al. reported the trend of ciprofloxacin resistance in the range of 20% and  <dig> % from  <dig> to  <dig> in belgium
 <cit> . the overall resistivity is in close association with the reporting of mattheus et al. in  <dig> from pork meat of belgium
 <cit> . however, higher resistivity has been reported from other parts of europe 
 <cit> . fluroquinolones are the drug of choice after erythromycin for the treatment of campylobacteriosis in human. therefore, emergence of fluroquinolone resistance is a serious matter of concern and potential threat to public health.

gentamicin resistance was found low  in comparison to other antimicrobials used in this study. in a research performed in  <dig> in canada, norma et al. found  <dig> % resistivity against gentamicin
 <cit> . this research has regarded gentamicin and chloramphenicol as safe and effective drugs for the treatment of human campylobacteriosis if pork is considered as the source of infection. however, in-vitro antibiotic sensitivity test should be carried for severe or prolonged or immune compromised cases of food borne campylobacteriosis if the source is unknown.

the prevalence of campylobacters in chilled and unchilled carcass was statistically significant . in a study in  <dig>  oosterom et al. isolated campylobacter spp. from 9% and 0% of the carcasses before and after chilling, respectively
 <cit> . similarly, in  <dig>  nesbakken et al. reported  <dig> % and  <dig> % prevalence before and after blast freezing of the carcass
 <cit> . similarly, in  <dig>  pearce et al. detected the prevalence rate of 33% in carcass prior to chilling and 0% in chilled carcass
 <cit> . so, lack of chilling the carcass is identified as a risk factor for prevalence of campylobacters in dressed pork.

the prevalence rate in slaughter slab where contamination of carcass with intestinal content occurs sometimes was significantly higher compared to the slaughter slab where such contamination never occurred . this is due to the fact that the intestinal content of pig is highly contaminated with campylobacter <cit> . so, contamination of carcass with intestinal content is another risk factor for prevalence of campylobacters in pork.

the prevalence of campylobacter spp. from slaughter slabs and retail shops where wooden chopping board  was not cleaned daily was significantly higher  compared to those cleaning the chopping wood  daily. this shows that chopping wood used in slaughter slab could be potential source of campylobacter contamination but samples from these equipments were not cultured for confirmation. so, further research is needed for confirmation. similarly significant difference  in the prevalence of campylobacter spp. was observed between the pork meat shop that regularly cleaned the weighing machine and others that do not clean weighing machine regularly. so, slaughtering equipments are also risk factors for campylobacter contamination in pork. oosterom et al. in  <dig>  icmsf in  <dig> and pearce et al. in  <dig> have also regarded slaughtering equipments as important risk factors for cross contamination of campylobacter in pork
 <cit> .

the mar index for the isolated campylobacters is very high in this research which is suggestive of public health hazard. all of the isolates are resistant to at least one of the most of commonly used antibiotics included in this study. more importantly,  <dig> % of the isolated c. coli were resistant to six different antibiotics and  <dig> % were resistant to seven different antibiotics used in the study. this implies severe threat to public health. likewise,  <dig> % of the isolated c. jejuni were resistant to seven different antibiotics used in the study. the reason behind this may be due to excessive use of antibiotics in pig for treatment as well as growth promoter. the other reason may be due to environmental cross-contamination through other risk factors such as contact with reservoirs like human. this shows that nepalese people are constantly consuming multiple antibiotic resistant campylobacters in their diet through pork meat. ery-amp was the most common resistant pattern  regardless of the species whereas, thakur and gebreyes reported ery-tet as most common resistant pattern  in porcine carcass from conventional pig rising farms in 2005
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the pork meat of chitwan district is highly contaminated with multiple antibiotic resistant thermophilic campylobacter spp. in which c. coli followed by c. jejuni are predominant species. both the butchers and consumers should be made aware regarding this issue. the isolated campylobacters showed highest resistivity to macrolids, ampicillin and fluoroquinolones and highest sensitivity to chloramphenicol and gentamicin. so, chloramphenicol and gentamicin should be preferred for the treatment of campylobacteriosis in pigs as well as in human if it is suspected of pig origin. veterinarians and para-veterinarians should adopt prudent use of antibiotics in pigs. contamination of intestinal content during slaughtering, cross contamination through slaughter house equipments and lack of chilling facilities are the major risk factors of campylobacter contamination. routine monitoring of slaughter slab condition and strict implementation of animal slaughter and meat inspection act  <dig> should be done together with the awareness campaign for the butchers and consumers.
