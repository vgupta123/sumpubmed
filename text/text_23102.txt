BACKGROUND
single nucleotide polymorphisms  are common single base dna sequence variants that account for a sizable portion of the genetic variability between individuals. some snps are common and have minor allele frequencies that approach 50%, while others are found much less frequently. there is some conceptual overlap between rare snps  and disease implicated mutations, but in common usage the term polymorphism is restricted to non-pathogenic sequence changes. genome snp patterns are fingerprints identifying subpopulations with common heritage that potentially instigate subpopulation specific traits exploitable for individualized treatment of disease. for the purposes of this discussion, it is implicit that the snps accumulate in the genome because they negligibly affect survival, however, we recognize that some snps may in fact have deleterious effects on the expression or function of protein products.

another distinction that is germane to the present work is between synonymous and nonsynonymous snps. snps that lie within the coding region are synonymous if they do not change the amino acid specified by the codon and are nonsynonymous when they do. even though synonymous snps will not change protein sequence they might still impact expression of a protein product by influencing the subcellular localization, stability or translational efficiency of mrna  <cit> . the nonsynonymous snp introduces a single amino acid change into the protein sequence. assessing the impact of such protein sequence changes on protein function can be difficult. for most snps whose minor allele frequency is at least 5%, it is likely that their impact on genetic fitness is minor  <cit> . snps that clearly have harmful functional consequences only rarely become more common than this 5% level in the population as a whole. for less common snps, homozygous individuals that have two copies of the snp are rare and deleterious consequences can often be masked by the presence of the more common functional allele. another factor in deciding the significance of the nonsynonymous snps is genetic redundancy. the affected gene could be one copy among several present in the genome. these factors decide the prevalence of the affected protein in the tissues and may be more important for survival than how the snp affects protein function. furthermore, a snp induced loss of functionality can sometimes be compensated by redundant functionality in the larger physiological system. an example is skeletal muscle where the relative composition of the myosin isoforms depends on environmental factors such as exercise  <cit>  or zero gravity  <cit> . the muscle tissue may adapt to loss of function in the snp affected isoform to assure survival. finally, while snps accumulated in the data base are identified world wide without apparent prejudice, they are not necessarily a random sampling of the genome. snp frequency in different gene regions could reflect uneven dna sequencing accuracy and efficiency or other unknown biases inadvertently built into the data base. our results are implications from the current data base that changes and grows daily.

here we identify and discuss the myosin heavy chain nonsynonymous snps. we will include even scarce snps where homozygous individuals are rare. we do so in the spirit of being comprehensive, with the full understanding that neutrality of function cannot be assumed in these cases. additionally, some snps discussed appear in the database, but have not been confirmed by other groups. our purpose is to provide a rationale for using these reports to investigate structure-function relationships in myosin. functional sub-domains within myosin have emerged as disturbance propagators essential to transduction. they are structural entities in which to identify snp substitution sites and focus speculation on how snps influence myosin function.

the myosin heavy chain  consists of a globular head domain called subfragment  <dig>  and c-terminal tail responsible for dimerization and cargo binding. in muscle, myosin dimers form  filaments with interacting tails and head domains projecting outward from the filament to associate with complementary actin  filaments in a muscle sarcomere  <cit> . cellular myosins have several forms  <cit> . the cellular myosin v dimer is a processive motor utilizing the two heads cooperatively to move along actin filaments  <cit> .

s <dig> contains functional sub-domains that retain their structure, but move relatively, during transduction  <cit> . atpase transduction starts in the active site composed in part by the p-loop, switch  <dig>  and switch  <dig> polypeptides  that sense the γ-phosphate position and coordination. atp hydrolysis in the active site is not followed immediately by phosphate release because the switch  <dig> r <dig> and switch  <dig> e <dig> salt-bridge "back door" inhibits phosphate release until actin binds. with actin binding, the back door opens to release phosphate and the switch  <dig> α-helix  transmits linear force originating from the active site to a converter domain converting linear force into torque to rotate the lever-arm. the lever-arm α-helix, rigidified by the bound myosin light chains , amplifies displacement and impels myosin relative to actin  <cit> . a region between the switch  <dig> helix and the converter domain, the sh2/sh <dig> hinge, undergoes substantial conformation change during the transduction. the 7-stranded β-sheet, switch  <dig> helix, converter, lever-arm, and sh2/sh <dig> hinge are the sub-domains identified in the skeletal myosin crystal structure depicted in figure  <dig> <cit> .

multiple peptides within s <dig>  constitute the actin binding site. this site alternates between weak and strong actin binding affinity in coordination with the lever-arm swing. phosphate release in muscle myosin atpase  is rate limiting due to its inhibition by a large entropic energy barrier in the absence of actin. phosphate release initiates lever-arm swing hence the rate limiting step inhibits progress through the cycle until actin binds and a work producing lever-arm power stroke is possible. coupling actin binding to reducing the energy barrier to phosphate release is an allosteric effect predicted for myopathy or c-loop structured surface loops  <cit> . we showed the c-loop is the allosteric actin contact sensor mediating bidirectionally between the actin-binding and active sites  <cit> . the c-loop lowers the energy barrier to phosphate release by coupling structural transitions within the s <dig> that allow phosphate release without inducing strain in the 7-stranded β-sheet. several actin binding myosin surface loops are identified in figure  <dig> 

in this paper we locate nonsynonymous snps within the functional sub-domains and evaluate their expected functional impact based on: i) how well the native residue is conserved among isoforms, ii) comparison of general physical characteristics  between the native and substituted side chain, and iii)  the hypothetical role of the native residue in transduction and how this role could be affected by the substituted side chain. we find that snps infiltrate nearly every corner of the myosin head and that their significance may lie in where they are tolerated in contrast to where they are excluded.

most mhc isoforms contribute snps including the fast skeletal muscle isoforms 2×, 2a, 2b, embryonic, and perinatal; α- and β-cardiac myosins; smooth muscle variants sm1a and sm2b; myosin v; super-fast myosin; two isoforms of myh14; myh15; and other unconventional myosins including ie, vi, viia, viib, ixa, ixb, and x. myosin 2b  is a fast skeletal myosin isoform apparently expressed in a skeletal jaw closing  muscle  <cit> . the embryonic and perinatal isoforms  are developmentally regulated  <cit> . the embryonic isoform also expresses in regenerating muscle and in extraocular muscles   <cit> . a mutation in perinatal myosin is implicated in a rare genetic disease causing distal arthrogryposis syndrome  <cit> . the α-cardiac isoform  is predominantly expressed in the atrium  <cit> . the β-cardiac isoform  is predominantly expressed in the heart ventriculum and in slow or type  <dig> skeletal muscle fibers. numerous heart disease implicated mutations occur in the β-cardiac mhc  <cit> . another myosin isoform  on chromosome  <dig> is called a β-cardiac myosin with 85% homology with the β-cardiac myosin coded by myh <dig> 

the myh <dig> gene encodes the  <dig> smooth muscle myosin isoforms that differ near the c-terminus  or at loop  <dig> where a seven amino acid peptide is omitted  or inserted   <cit> . the loop  <dig> insert correlates with tissue localization  <cit>  and enzyme kinetics  <cit> . nucleotide-induced fluorescence intensity increase in the highly conserved w <dig> occurs in all but one myosin isoform implying it results from common origin within the conserved motor core. the sma isoform has nucleotide-induced tryptophan fluorescence enhancement like other myosin isoforms but we showed with site-directed mutagenesis that the contributing tryptophan is probably not w <dig>  these results suggested that sma and smb myosin isoforms have different influence propagating pathways emanating from the active site through the switch  <dig> helix containing w <dig> to the converter domain  <cit> .

processive myosin v  translates over actin filaments using a hand-over-hand mechanism  <cit> . the super-fast isoform  expresses in eoms performing diverse functions including eye movement  <cit> . the eoms are more complex than limb muscles with  <dig> or more different mhcs expressed in adult muscle including the fast skeletal, β-cardiac, and embryonic mhc. the super-fast myosin supports higher velocity and lower tension contractions  <cit> . the myh <dig> gene codes for  <dig> myosin isoforms  expressed in muscle and non muscle tissue. the myh <dig> gene is implicated in hearing disorders  <cit> . snp variants in myh <dig> are associated with elevated risk for heart disease  <cit> .

myosin ie  is a cellular myosin with an extended c-loop thought to interact with tropomyosin in tropomyosin-containing actin  <cit> . myosin vi is a reversedirection motor with core structure resembling forward-direction motors except for two inserts . insert  <dig>  near the active site and switch  <dig>  is probably partially responsible for the slow adp release  <cit> . insert  <dig> modifies the converter domain to re-direct lever-arm swing for reverse-directed motility  <cit> . mutations in myosin vii aassociate with us her syndrome that in its most severe phenotype is a deafness-blindness disorder  <cit> . myosin ixb is a single headed processive motor that is unique because its rate limiting step is not adp release but atp hydrolysis  suggesting it remains actin bound even in a weak actin binding state  <cit> . slow dissociation from actin is attributed to tethering by a unique loop  <dig> insertion. myosin x is a membrane associated motor involved in filopodia motility  <cit>  that has novel monomeric and dimeric conformations at physiological protein concentrations  <cit> . calmodulin or calmodulin like protein  are the lever-arm bound myosin light chains in myosin x  <cit> . myosin x is believed to be processive consistent with its function in the cell.

snp implications for motor function
three snps, r246h, e469q  and g701r , are remarkable because of the functional significance of the residues they modify. r <dig> and e <dig> form the switch 1/switch  <dig> salt-bridge at the γ-phosphate in bound atp preventing product release following hydrolysis in the active site of s <dig>  site-directed mutagenesis of dictyostelium discoideum  myosin produced r246e, e469r, and the double mutant r246e/e469r reversing the polarity of the salt-bridge  <cit> . only the double mutant remained functional but with altered atpase kinetics. similar experiments using expressed smooth muscle myosin suggested r <dig> is significant for back door closure after atp binding to the active site and that e <dig> is important for atp hydrolysis by its positioning of a water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate  <cit> . the e469q snp substitution does not necessarily prohibit the latter mechanism although e469a/r mutants eliminated the phosphate burst and actin-activated atpase. the r246h snp substitution alters size but not charge of the side chain while r246a/e mutants likewise eliminated the phosphate burst and actin-activated atpase. the loss of the phosphate burst and actin-activated atpase indicates the phosphate release step is no longer rate limiting undermining the efficient energy transduction in muscle because the atpase cycle disengages from the work producing interaction with actin. the snps suggests it would be interesting to test the r246h and e469q substitutions in an in vitro system. r246h occurs in myosin viia where atpase is rate limited by adp release rather than phosphate release possibly explaining its tolerance to substitution. e469q occurs in β-cardiac myosin where atpase is rate limited by phosphate release. r246h and e469q occur with unknown or apparently low probability for expression, respectively.

g701r in super-fast myosin replaces the glycine swivel with a residue containing a bulky side chain inhibiting free rotation in the ramachandran angles that is characteristic only to glycine  <cit> . the highly conserved g <dig> pivot was found to be essential for motor activity in skeletal  <cit>  and dicty  <cit>  myosins. s <dig> crystal structures depicting myosin conformation in m**  <cit>  and m*  <cit>  lever-arm orientation states indicate g <dig> swivels 40- <dig> deg about two axes with the lever-arm swing  <cit> . unlike nearby swivel-candidate residues, g <dig> and g <dig>  the g <dig> maintains conformations in the pre- and post-powerstroke states that only glycine can readily accommodate. if the g701r substituted protein truly functions in healthy individuals, it suggests the super-fast myosin has a substantially modified transduction mechanism to accomplish its high velocity contraction. the g701r substitution occurs with an average heterozygous population in percent  of  <dig> % and with homozygous individuals identified.

the converter domain has been implicated as the element undergoing elastic distortion in the myosin accompanying force development prior to mechanical work production  <cit> . site directed mutagenesis in the sh2/sh <dig> hinge--converter interface, and in the converter domain proper, provided clues for how it performs the conversion of linear translation in the switch  <dig> helix to the rotation of the lever-arm  <cit> . mutations f713a or f768a completely eliminated or sharply inhibited the ability of smooth muscle myosin to function mechanically. standard kinetics experiments looking at the atp binding, hydrolysis, product release, and the fluorescence from the atp sensitive tryptophan  indicate active site kinetics and transmission of force through the switch  <dig> helix are fully intact in the mutants. the findings suggest that the mutations perturb only the converter function. other experiments, specifically fluorescence resonance energy transfer , actin sliding assay, and single myosin force development show that both mutants are compromised mechanically. the f713a mutant causes a catastrophic mechanical failure due to the loss of the hydrophobic contact between the sh2/sh <dig> hinge and converter. the f768a mutant looses the rigidity of the switch  <dig> helix/converter contact at f <dig> making a motor that can rotate its lever-arm but with less force. the sh2/sh <dig> hinge has a high density of snp substitutions with  <dig> occurring in a  <dig> residue peptide. snp sites at r <dig> and r <dig> are highly conserved among myosin isoforms but do not appear to enter into the crucial interaction with the converter domain. m <dig> is not conserved among the myosin isoforms.

the sole converter domain snp substitution not implicated in disease is r743q that is also common with an ahp of  <dig> %. the snp occurs in myosin x that has a low converter domain sequence homology with myosin 2×. myosin vi, vii, and x have a unique structure at the head-tail junction wherein a monomeric single α-helix  competes with the dimeric coiled-coil  <cit> . the sah domain might function as an elastic element undermining converter domain significance in this isoform. hypothetically, the converter domain is sensitive to mutation because it usually needs to perform the two functions of the linear-to-rotary motion converter and elastic element.

the l785m, d787n , and a801t snp substitutions modify the leverarm. mutation in this region could interfere with essential light chain  binding. the loss of light chains, either regulatory  or elc, affects myosin morphology and its motor function probably by lowering the rigidity of the lever-arm domain  <cit> . either substitution could also directly perturb the lever-arm structure and rigidity also leading to loss of function. none of these possibilities may be happening due to the lever-arm snp substitutions because their consequences would be severe. aside from g701r and r743q, snps shown in figure  <dig> affect a small or unknown percentage of the population.

the essential light chain  appears to couple sh <dig> and lever-arm sub-domains in s <dig>  lc <dig> and lc <dig> are elc isoforms expressed in skeletal muscle with the s <dig> heavy chain binding lc1/rlc or lc3/rlc pairs in equal amounts. lc <dig> differs from lc <dig> by a  <dig> residue extension at the n-terminus. cardiac myosin has only lc <dig>  the flexible lc <dig> n-terminus is not resolved in s <dig> crystal structures and is not shown in figure  <dig>  electron cryomicroscopy reconstructions suggest sh <dig> and the n-terminus of lc <dig> interact in skeletal muscle myosin  <cit> . there it is suggested that the sh3/lc <dig> interaction could facilitate the lc1/actin interaction known to affect the overall actomyosin interaction in skeletal and cardiac myosins  <cit>  and that sh <dig> could contain an lc1/active-site path of influence known to modulate myosin atpase  <cit> . the p31t substitution in myh <dig> and v60i in myosin x are common.

snp implications for actomyosin
protein-protein contacts in actomyosin were identified by experimental structural studies combined with simulated docking of the myosin and actin crystal structures  <cit> , by detecting changes in actin binding strength, actin-activated myosin atpase, and in vitro motility caused by the mutation of small peptide segments or individual residues in myosin  <cit> . primary hydrophobic actin contacts are helical segments, aa529- <dig> and aa652- <dig>  while the unstructured surface loop  <dig>  maintains ionic interactions with the actin n-terminus. secondary sites are an unstructured surface loop, loop  <dig> , and the structured myopathy loop   <cit>  also on the s <dig> surface. figure  <dig> shows the actin binding myosin surface loops including loops  <dig>   <dig>  myopathy and c-loop. also shown are actin binding site snp substitutions f534l and f655s that fall within a primary hydrophobic actin contact.

experimental work comparing tertiary structure of skeletal and β-cardiac mhc identified the c-loop , figures  <dig> and  <dig>  having influence on active site coupling to actin and possibly a direct interaction with actin  <cit> . limited proteolysis of skeletal s <dig> cleaves the heavy chain at loop  <dig>  and loop  <dig> producing  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda molecular mass fragments  <cit> . these loops are involved in regulation of substrate release  and in actin binding and regulation of actin-activated atpase   <cit> . limited proteolysis of βs <dig> cleaves the heavy chain at equivalent points and at the c-loop within the  <dig> kda fragment  <cit> . the c-loop cleavage dramatically affects βs <dig> mg++atpase suggesting it participates in energy transduction  <cit> . actin binding protected loop  <dig> from proteolysis in skeletal s <dig> indicating loop  <dig> involvement in actin binding  <cit> . actin binding to βs <dig> fails to inhibit loop  <dig> cleavage  <cit>  but does inhibit c-loop cleavage  <cit> . these observations highlight differences in skeletal s <dig> and βs <dig> conformation and identify the c-loop as a possible actin binding site. the c-loop was proposed as a site of actin binding in skeletal s <dig>  <cit> , in myosin v  <cit> , and in myosin ie where it is called loop  <dig>  <cit> . we constructed single site mutations in the smooth muscle myosin c-loop and chimeric proteins containing c-loop sequences from βs <dig> and skeletal s <dig> to investigate how sequence perturbs c-loop function  <cit> . based on this work we proposed that the c-loop is an allosteric actin contact sensor initiating actin-activation of the myosin atpase.

the c-loop snp substitutions, r370h , q371p, and p378q, occur in the myosin viia, super-fast myosin and α-cardiac myosin, respectively. in super-fast myosin, the q/p substitution can be expected to perturb and rigidify the c-loop structure with the proline. we proposed structural rigidity in the c-loop is probably necessary for its effectiveness  <cit>  but overall structure also plays a role and impacts myosin kinetics  <cit> . each of these substitutions is expected to affect myosin kinetics related to its interaction with actin, e.g. actin-activated atpase and motility. heterozygous q371p alleles are significantly abundant although no homozygous individuals were detected. abundance of the other snps is untested.

loop  <dig> and near loop  <dig> snp substitutions are a621v, t631n , a637v , and e643k . a/v substitution replaces the apolar alanine with the larger apolar valine, t/n exchanges two neutral polar groups, and e/k reverses charge. the effect of loop  <dig> on myosin atpase and myosin interaction with actin has been thoroughly studied with site directed mutagenesis. in dicty myosin ii, loop  <dig> tolerates significant sequence changes without affecting function. function seems to depend on charged or apolar residue distribution but not on specific structural features because the loop is flexible. a/v and t/n substitutions are conservative and unlikely to impact function. the a637v substitution is from perinatal myosin and abundant in this isoform although no homozygous individuals were detected. abundance of the other loop  <dig> snps is untested.

the myopathy loop is a structured surface loop containing an unusual clustering of heart disease implicated mutations including r406q/w/l, v407m, v409m, and g410v  <cit> . it was shown to be an actin binding site  <cit>  and modulator of actin activated atpase  <cit> . at r <dig>  the smooth muscle heavy meromyosin  model for β-cardiac myosin has largely reiterated the clinical phenotype  <cit> . the g410v mutant shows modest changes in actomyosin affinity possibly indicating a generally degraded fit between myosin and actin like the r <dig> mutants  <cit> . the r406w mutant appears in the snp data base in apparently healthy individuals. r408c  has not been implicated in disease. none of the myopathy loop snps have significant abundance although homozygous individuals carrying r406w were identified.

the loop  <dig> snp substitutions, r570k  and v572a/d , and the hydrophobic actin binding site residue substitutions, f534l and f655s, are conservative except for f655s. among the myosin isoforms, all of these residues are variable. the heterozygous allele for f534l in skeletal myosin 2b has significant abundance  but no homozygous individuals were identified.

other myosin s <dig> snps
snps appearing in table  <dig> but not discussed in the context of figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> locate to the n-terminus , the upper  <dig> k  and lower  <dig> k . the upper  <dig> k and lower  <dig> k domains  designate peptides within the  <dig> k of s <dig> on either side of the cleft that closes on strong binding to actin. n-term snp substitutions include d4a in myh <dig> and d4e in myh <dig>  r18c, r24p/l, t25m , m142i , r145g , i148t , and l199f . the u <dig> snp substitutions include h287r, e300d , t307p, p320a , s323c , i326t, v335i , r336h , t345a, v350d/a from myosin 2b and r350w  from myosin x. l <dig> snp substitutions are i514t and a594t. snp substitutions q329r and i514t are disease implicated. snps in the "other myosin s1" category do not fall within, or are not spatially proximal to, presently recognized s <dig> functional elements directly participating in transduction. the average heterozygous snp allele frequency for this set ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> %  with most heterozygous substitutions having significant abundance and some untested.

identifying sites for probing motor dynamics
discussion
snps account for about 75% of the number of sequence differences between individuals in a population  <cit> . they have significant utility in gene mapping studies and there are an increasing number of snps that have been shown to have a significant influence on an individual's susceptibility to disease and response to various drug therapies. in some well-studied genes and gene families, patterns of snps within the coding sequences have also provided some insight into protein function. perhaps the best known example of this is the snp  that leads to sickle cell anemia. this glu6val change in the protein sequence has an allele frequency of about 25% in yoruban populations and creates well-known negative and presumed positive consequences for the individuals that carry this sequence variant. myosin snps could likewise create negative and positive consequences for certain populations with specific functional requirements that should be explored experimentally. nonsynonymous snps that have truly neutral functional consequences also provide important information about protein function, because they highlight regions of protein structure that are tolerant of structural variation. we discuss three scenarios for interpreting snp data denoted, the function-neutral, the too-robust, and the too-sensitive.

snps reside in healthy people, otherwise they are deleted by natural selection, hence it might be hypothesized that the amino acid substitution is function-neutral. in this case, snps identify residues or components of the motor not directly related to core function making them candidate sites for adventitious modification. an example is the r240w substitution that places a spectroscopic probe in the 7-stranded β-sheet at the interface of the active and actin-binding sites. it is thought that coordination of atp hydrolysis with actin binding and release is mediated by this β-sheet and an optical probe of its structure would be valuable. r <dig> is not highly conserved among species but infrequently substituted by aromatic residues. its negligible ahp raises uncertainty about potential use although homozygous individuals were reported. g <dig> is the pivot for the lever-arm swing and thought to be necessary for myosin function. the g701r snp substitution has  <dig> % ahp but it is difficult to understand how this substitution could be function-neutral in the swinging lever-arm picture for force production. other unlikely function-neutral candidates are the r246h and e469q substitutions with unknown and insignificant ahp, respectively. r <dig> and e <dig> form the sw1/sw <dig> salt-bridge regulating phosphate release in atpase in the rate limiting step for muscle myosins. r246h originates from the cellular myosin vii isoform where the native rate limiting adp release minimizes r <dig> significance. e469q originates from β-cardiac myosin using the phosphate release mechanism. under the function-neutral hypothesis, the collection of snps at r <dig>  e <dig> and the vicinity of the 7-stranded β-sheet would imply a diminished role for this structure in energy transduction.

an alternative to the function-neutral hypothesis is that snp substitutions modify functional structures too-robust to be disturbed by otherwise intrusive sequence changes. excluding for a moment the e469q and g701r special cases, several structures in s <dig> fulfill expectations implied by this hypothesis. the 7-stranded β-sheet and vicinity collected  <dig> snp substitution sites  over  <dig> of the  <dig> myosin genes where snps were identified. the too-robust hypothesis implies that the energy transduction mechanism contained in the 7-stranded β-sheet is too well designed by evolution to be compromised by any of the snp substitutions. actin binding by s <dig>  modified by snps in the main hydrophobic binding site , in loop  <dig> , loop  <dig> , the myopathy loop , and the c-loop , is another potential too-robust site. the switch  <dig> helix, charged with propagating linear motion from the active site to the converter domain, suffers seven snp substitutions and functions while the sh2/sh <dig> hinge and lever-arm successfully manage impacts of six and two snp substitutions, respectively. returning to e469q and g701r, the functional impact of e469q  has not been evaluated in vitro, however, other substitutions at this site were disruptive to muscle myosin function except when the polarity of the r246/e <dig> salt-bridge was reversed. then the mutant s <dig> functioned near normally. the e469q substitution seems likely to disrupt the interaction with r <dig> thereby altering specific rates in the atpase cycle but potentially within boundaries that do not overly impact function. the g701r substitution is difficult to rationalize even in the too-robust hypothesis. the functional impact of g701r has likewise not been evaluated in vitro but a glycine swivel is disrupted by the presence of any side chain with a β-carbon. how super-fast myosin could function with g701r needs clarification.

the too-robust hypothesis is often the implicit working hypothesis for those utilizing site directed mutagenesis to study protein mechanisms. it may sometimes be too optimistic an assumption for interpreting snps. the snp substitution may affect protein function compensated by redundant functionality outside the affected protein in the larger physiological system. different snps will have different applicable hypotheses and the challenge is to identify the correct one to apply.

we anticipated snp clustering in a few regions of the myosin head identifying the expendable components of the system unrelated to core functionality. this occurred to some extent within the narrow context of the significant ahp snps. residues 1- <dig> in mhc show significant ahp snp substitutions at the n-terminus and in the aa280- <dig> peptide segments that do not fall into the identified functional sub-domains. however, residues 401- <dig> show a different picture with all but one significant ahp snp substitution modifying functional sub-domains. overviewing the total set of substitutions, the s <dig> snps are distributed spatially over the protein more uniformly than expected. figure  <dig> shows the annotated s <dig> from figure  <dig> with the snp substitution sites identified by the solid atom rendering in yellow. most snps locate within, or to the vicinity of, domains intimately connected to the myosin core functionality. they do not seem to select any one structural feature for a diminished role in the core functionality except possibly the 7-stranded β-sheet that attracted so many snp substitutions.

the myopathy loop and the converter domain nearly escaped modification by snps not already disease related. they each have one snp substitution not known to be disease implicated. as suggested by its name, known mutations in the myopathy loop accompany heart disease  <cit> . snps do not appear in the myopathy loop because most substitutions cause serious functional deficit. the same appears to be true for the converter where there are  <dig> or more heart disease linked mutations. these structures are too-sensitive to substitution to be a target for snps. the large ahp for the snp substitution r743q in the converter domain  appears to have identified a unique site in the domain that can be safely modified. at least for myosin, regions or domains excluded from snp substitution may be the most precisely defined. these high sensitivity regions are anti-targets for snps because they are not functionally robust  rather than because they are the only domains necessary for function.

CONCLUSIONS
single nucleotide polymorphisms of the myosin heavy chain were mined from the ncbi data base using computer programs written in perl that identified human nonsynonymous snp amino acid missense substitutions for any mhc gene. twenty-two mhc genes were searched including muscle and non-muscle myosin isoforms. excluding disease implicated residues and sites without homology with skeletal myosin 2×, the  <dig> snps identified were distributed spatially homogeneously over mhc with  <dig> falling outside specific functional domains. the remaining  <dig> snps were spatially related to the 7-stranded β-sheet mediating active site and actin binding site communication , the actin binding peptides , switch  <dig> helix , sh2/sh <dig> hinge , sh <dig> , lever-arm , and converter . two functional elements were almost devoid of snps, the converter domain and the myopathy loop. these elements are burdened with an unusually high number of disease implicated mutations. the snp substitution sites in mhc suggest they can infiltrate domains that are engineered by evolution to be "too-robust" to be disturbed by otherwise intrusive sequence changes, and, "function-neutral" sites where substitution is immaterial. disease implicated mutations and the absence of snp substitutions map to regions "too-sensitive" to be modified because they have not evolved a robust sequence paradigm for performing their function.
