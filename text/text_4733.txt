BACKGROUND
copper is an essential element for most living organisms. its incorporation into specific enzymes is required for catalysis of several vital, and highly conserved cellular processes  <cit> . for example, copper binding to specific sites in cytochrome c oxidase  is required for complex assembly and stability, electron transfer activity, and ultimately respiratory metabolism  <cit> . copper metallation also has important roles in responding to oxidative stress, by activating superoxide dismutase   <cit> , and in regulating iron import by activating ferroxidases, which oxidize substrates for iron transporters  <cit> .

the unique redox chemistry of copper ions, which allows it to exist in an oxidized  or reduced  state, is key to its catalytic properties but also contributes to its production of reactive oxygen species . to keep this deleterious capacity in check, the cell has evolved mechanisms to maintain tight regulatory control of copper storage and transport  <cit> . metallochaperones protect the cell from copper toxicity by binding to free copper and facilitating its transport to, and incorporation into, important target proteins  <cit> . the yeast cytosolic chaperone atx <dig> for example, delivers copper to the ccc <dig> atpase, which transports copper into the golgi where it activates the fet <dig> ferrooxidase, ultimately leading to iron uptake.

the importance of maintaining proper copper homeostasis is underscored by several rare, yet severe, genetic diseases. wilson’s disease is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from mutations in the copper transporter atp7b, the human ortholog of yeast ccc <dig>  patients express a variety of neurological, psychiatric, and hepatic problems arising from abnormal copper accumulation, primarily in the brain and liver  <cit> . mutations in the related gene atp7a cause the x-linked recessive disorder menkes disease  <cit> . notably, the clinical symptoms of this disease arise from copper deficiency, and include neurological defects , growth retardation, hypothermia and “kinky” or “steely” hair  <cit> . mitochondrial complex iv disorders, including leigh syndrome, have also been linked to genes with important roles in copper metabolism, including sco <dig>  sco <dig>  and surf- <dig>  <cit> . abnormal copper concentrations have also been observed in alzheimer’s and huntington’s disease  <cit> , and copper has been shown to promote aggregation of the α-synuclein protein, a hallmark of parkinson’s disease  <cit> .

yeast has been an exceptionally useful model organism for deciphering the cellular mechanisms regulating copper homeostasis  <cit> , and indeed yeast orthologs exist for most of the disease genes described above. here, we leverage the dependency between respiratory growth rate and copper availability to conduct a systematic screen for genes associated with copper homeostasis. this screen identified genes with known roles in copper regulation, and those with no previously identified functional association with copper. consistent with the vacuole being a cellular store for copper, many of the genes identified are required for vacuole acidification, and we go on to show that copper is in fact limiting under conditions of vacuole stress. several genes were also orthologs of human disease genes that have not been previously linked to copper imbalance. finally, we demonstrate that the approved drug disulfiram , and the experimental drug elesclomol , can rescue respiratory growth defects arising from copper deficiency.

RESULTS
respiratory fitness and copper
though yeast preferentially ferment glucose for energy, they are able to switch to oxidative phosphorylation in the absence of a fermentable carbon source  <cit> . this attribute, in addition to its simple growth requirements, makes yeast a powerful model system for identifying chemical probes targeting energy metabolism  <cit> . to identify chemical compounds that ‘boost’ respiratory growth, and potentially serve as leads for human mitochondrial diseases, we conducted a phenotypic screen of ~ <dig> natural product derivatives  for compounds that accelerated growth of respiring yeast , but not fermenting yeast . this screen identified a series of structurally related compounds with the desired effect, but we determined that this effect was attributed to the cucl <dig> salt with which each compound was supplied .

to further examine the effect of copper ions on respiratory growth, yeast  was grown in yp media containing the non-fermentable carbon source ethanol , at various concentrations of copper sulfate . growth of 100 μl cultures was monitored in 96well plates by measuring the increase in absorbance over time . supplemental copper concentrations as low as  <dig> nm were found to boost growth . this boost was dose-dependent, but plateaued at 2 μm, indicating a saturation of copper above this concentration. in contrast, no such boost was observed in dextrose-containing media  . this positive effect of cu was further confirmed to be specific to respiratory growth conditions by comparing growth in other fermentable  and non-fermentable  carbon sources . similar results were obtained using spot assays on agar plates. when respiring yeast were pre-grown in the presence of copper-supplemented media, no significant increase in the number of colony forming units was observed, however, the size of each colony was substantially increased . from this we conclude that copper  does not dramatically influence yeast viability, but rather, increases growth under respiratory conditions.

we also tested the effect of copper depletion on respiratory growth, by culturing yeast in increasing concentrations  of the copper chelator, bathocuproine disulphonic acid . a significant dose-dependent reduction in growth was observed at bcs concentrations as low as 1 μm, and growth was strongly inhibited at bcs concentrations higher than 100 μm . this inhibitory effect, however, was attenuated by addition of cuso <dig> to the growth medium . for example, the addition of 500 μm cuso <dig> completely suppressed the inhibitory effects of bcs. similar experiments using ypd media showed that addition of bcs does not alter fermentative growth . collectively, these results demonstrate a critical dependency between respiratory growth and copper ion concentrations in the growth medium.

a screen for copper homeostasis genes
to better understand the underlying cellular mechanisms controlling copper-dependent respiratory growth, we used the yeast homozygous gene deletion collection, in which individual diploid strains have both copies of a non-essential gene deleted. this collection has been a valuable resource for genome-scale analysis of conditions affecting growth  <cit> . each strain contains unique 20-bp “barcode” sequences flanked by common priming sites, allowing the relative abundance of individual strains to be quantitatively monitored within a pool of competitively-grown strains  <cit> . previous work has used this resource to identify genes that protect fermenting yeast from toxic concentrations of copper  <cit> . to identify genes that are important for cu-dependent respiratory growth, we measured the fitness of  <dig> homozygous deletion strains  in parallel in rich media  using dextrose, ethanol, glycerol, or lactate as a carbon source, in the presence or absence of 500 μm cuso <dig> . each condition was tested in triplicate. cel files are available via the ncbi's gene expression omnibus  <cit>  under accession number gse <dig>  though it was not a goal of this study, examination of this dataset reveals genes that are specifically required for metabolizing different non-fermentable carbon sources. for example, the fsh1Δ/fsh1Δ deletion strain showed an ethanol-specific growth defect . this suggests a role for fsh <dig>  a putative serine hydrolase that has sequence-similarity to the human candidate tumor suppressor ovca <dig>  <cit> , in ethanol metabolism.

importantly, these experiments identified a group of  <dig> respiratory-deficient strains  that grew in ypd but were undetectable following competitive growth in media using non-fermentable carbon sources. as expected, the majority  of these strains were previously identified in a screen for mutants with impaired mitochondrial respiration  <cit> . genes deleted in these strains were also enriched for the biological processes mitochondrion organization  and cellular respiration . we reasoned that the inability of these strains to compete with respiratory-proficient strains in our competitive assay may preclude accurate measurement of their response to cu. therefore, to better assay these strains, we assembled a smaller pool consisting only of these  <dig> strains, plus an additional  <dig> strains of interest , and interrogated this pool in ype, in the presence or absence of 500 μm cuso <dig> 

the effect of cuso <dig> on the collective growth of the pools was similar to that observed for by <dig> in figure  <dig>  to identify individual strains where this effect was altered, we compared the abundance of each barcode in the copper-treated samples to untreated samples, for both deletion pools, and for each non-fermentable carbon source . using a stringent cutoff , we identified  <dig> deletion strains in which cu’s positive effect on respiratory growth was quantitatively reduced, and  <dig> strains in which cu’s positive effects were substantively greater  in at least one non-fermentable carbon source . the latter set was largely comprised of strains with respiratory growth defects that were specifically rescued by the addition of cuso <dig>  however, the majority of strains with respiratory growth defects were not substantively aided by the addition of cuso <dig> , underscoring that the copper-rescue effect was specific to the  <dig> strains identified.

we applied hierarchical clustering to the cu-induced fitness changes observed in each of the four carbon sources for these  <dig> strains . an examination of the clusters across the experiment axis showed that all replicate experiments correlated as nearest neighbors, confirming that the genome-wide data were highly reproducible. samples grown in ypd clustered separately from the non-fermentable  carbon-sources and in ypd, the fitness of most of these strains was not greatly affected by the addition of cuso <dig>  this is consistent with copper affecting respiratory, but not fermentative growth at the concentration tested. while the results were generally consistent between the non-fermentable carbon sources, carbon source-specific effects were apparent as well. most notably, growth in lactate identified many more strains exhibiting an increased cu boost than did growth in ethanol or glycerol. this difference may be attributed to the higher respiratory fitness of many strains in ypl  which facilitates their detection in our competitive assay. while this explanation attributes carbon-source specific results to technical limitations of the competitive growth assay , it is also possible that mechanistic differences in the catabolism of ethanol, glycerol, and lactate result in discrete genetic dependencies for the copper response. further experimentation will be needed to determine whether such cases do indeed exist.

to search for functional enrichment among the genes that were deleted in the  <dig> and  <dig> strains identified above, we used the biological networks gene ontology plugin  for cytoscape . the two gene lists contained  <dig> and  <dig> ‘dubious’ open-reading frames, respectively, that partially overlapped with a verified gene. in several instances these strains confirmed the results for verified genes . one gene, ada <dig>  was represented twice in the deletion pool and both strains were identified in our screen. for our gene ontology  analysis we used the non-redundant set of genes. the  <dig> genes that were required for cu-dependent growth , were significantly enriched for several go categories, including 2-oxoglutarate metabolic process, and iron ion homeostasis . among the genes belonging to the latter term is fet <dig>  which encodes the high-affinity iron uptake protein that links iron and copper homeostasis  <cit> . the dependence of copper’s effects on fet <dig> was verified in isogenic cultures, and in fact, the fet3Δ/fet3Δ strain exhibited reduced  growth in 500 μm cuso <dig> . copper-limiting conditions are known to result in cellular iron deficiency  <cit> , and we found that addition of high concentrations of feso <dig> was itself sufficient to enhance respiratory growth of yeast . therefore, to further explore the role of iron, we repeated the experiment described in figure 1a in the presence of excess feso <dig>  addition of 1 mm feso <dig> was found to confer resistance to low concentrations  of bcs, and to effectively mask the growth advantages imparted by cuso <dig> under these conditions . collectively, these data suggest that increased iron uptake contributes to the respiratory growth increase arising from copper supplementation.

in contrast, the  <dig> genes in the enhanced growth group were significantly enriched for the go processes golgi to vacuole transport and vacuolar acidification . among this list of  <dig> genes are three genes that are directly linked to copper transport in yeast  and in higher eukaryotes . deletion of these genes was previously shown to result in growth defects on low copper media  <cit> . the cytosolic copper metallochaperone atx <dig> transports cu ions from the high-affinity copper transporter ctr <dig> in the plasma membrane to ccc <dig> on post-golgi vesicles to eventually target it to fet <dig> on the cell surface  <cit> . our screen also identified gef <dig>  a chloride channel involved in cation homeostasis. the gef <dig> protein co-localizes with ccc <dig> at late- and post-golgi vesicles and is required for loading cu ions onto fet <dig>  <cit> . for other genes identified by our screen, evidence supporting a functional role in cellular copper homeostasis is either limited or lacking entirely. these include ypl109c, which encodes a protein of unknown function that was detected in highly purified mitochondria  <cit> . figure 2d shows quantile-normalized fluorescence values for several of the deletion strains specifically discussed herein. the complete results for all strains identified in our screen are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> and s <dig>  collectively, these data will be a rich source of information for future characterization of genes involved in copper homeostasis.

previous work in yeast has demonstrated that mitochondria maintain a non-proteinaceous copper pool that exceeds cco-associated copper concentrations  <cit> . it is thought that this pool may serve as a source of copper ions for chaperones that mediate metallation of cco, which occurs at two cco subunits encoded by the mitochondrial genome, cox <dig> and cox <dig>  <cit> . the metallochaperone cox <dig> transfers copper to two mitochondrial inner membrane proteins cox <dig> and sco <dig>  <cit> , which then mediate metallation of cox <dig> and cox <dig>  respectively  <cit> . it is notable that our genomic screen did not identify the cox <dig>  cox <dig>  or sco <dig> deletion strains as being rescued by copper. these results are consistent with previous analysis of sco <dig> null strains  <cit> , and of cox <dig> null strains, whose respiratory growth defect was rescued by copper, but only at concentrations much higher than those used in the present study  <cit> .

vacuole acidity and copper homeostasis
the yeast vacuole, generally regarded as the functional equivalent of the mammalian lysosome, is an acidic organelle with a variety of important functions including: protein degradation, ion and small-molecule storage, and ph homeostasis  <cit> . consistent with previous work demonstrating an important role for the vacuole in storage and mobilization of cu ions  <cit> , several genes that maintain vacuolar ph, when deleted, were found to produce respiratory growth defects that were rescued by copper. these included numerous subunits of the vacuolar h+−atpase  and  <dig> subunits of the rave complex  which promotes assembly of the v-atpase holoenzyme. mobilization of vacuolar copper is thought to involve the ctr <dig> protein, a copper transporter that localizes to the vacuolar membranes of budding yeast  <cit> , fission yeast  <cit> , and mammalian cells  <cit> . though a ctr2Δ mutant was not included in our deletion collection and thus not identified in our screen, we did identify the ctr2-regulating transcription factors aft <dig> and mac <dig> <cit> .

these results suggest that the ph gradient across the vacuolar membrane plays a critical role in maintaining optimal copper homeostasis. we therefore examined the effects of increasing media ph on the cellular response to copper . because alkaline growth conditions increase vacuolar ph more than cytosolic ph  <cit> , they effectively reduce the ph gradient between the two cellular compartments. consistent with previous findings on dextrose-containing media  <cit> , we find that respiratory growth impairment by alkaline stress, is largely alleviated by supplementing the growth medium with cuso <dig> . to more directly assess the role of vacuole acidity on copper homeostasis, we applied the small molecule bafilomycin a <dig> , a natural product derived from streptomyces griseus that specifically inhibits vacuolar h+−atpase  <cit> . bafa strongly inhibited growth of respiring yeast at sub-micromolar concentrations however this inhibition could be suppressed by supplementing the media with cuso <dig> . these data further establish an important role for the vacuole in controlling cellular copper homeostasis, and moreover identify copper as a major limiting factor under vacuolar stress conditions. notably, addition of high concentrations of feso <dig> also partially suppressed growth inhibition by bafa and masked the effects of cuso <dig> under these conditions . this is consistent with cu-limitation arising from vacuole de-acidification causing a cellular iron deficiency that negatively impacts growth.

human disease genes
our functional screen was highly sensitive in detecting small cu-dependent changes in cell fitness. mutations in non-essential genes that yield subtle phenotypes may be more likely to cause disease, compared to for example, genes required for viability. therefore, we next examined the genes we identified for sequence homology to human genes associated with disease . table  <dig> lists those human disease genes with yeast orthologs, that when deleted, yield respiratory fitness-defects that are rescued by copper supplementation. the diseases associated with these genes include menkes and wilson’s disease, both of which are caused by mutations in genes orthologous to yeast ccc <dig>  and both of which are well established cu-related disorders  <cit> . the other diseases in table  <dig>  typically present with neurologic, musculoskeletal and hematologic features, which show remarkable similarities to clinical phenotypes seen in patients with menkes' copper deficiency  <cit> . many of these disease genes have a role in intracellular trafficking, including several members of the ap- <dig> adaptor complex, an important component of clathrin-coated vesicles  <cit> . interestingly, a combined zebrafish/yeast chemical-genetic screen has also identified this complex as having a conserved role in buffering the effects of copper limitation  <cit> . knock-down experiments in human cell lines will determine whether these genes fulfill a similar function in man, and may prompt a closer examination of whether copper plays a role in the disorders listed in table  <dig> 

twenty-one human disease genes which have a yeast orthologue  that, when deleted, produced a respiratory fitness defect that was specifically rescued by copper supplementation. the gene products of the  <dig> disease genes have distinct functions and subcellular localizations  <cit> , while mutations in these genes are typically associated with neurologic, musculoskeletal and hematologic disease phenotypes resembling those of copper deficiency .

pharmacological rescue of copper deficiencies
pharmacological modulation of cu homeostasis is an attractive therapeutic strategy for a variety of clinical applications. copper chelating agents are currently the standard treatment to ameliorate copper overloading of affected tissues in wilson’s disease  <cit> , whereas early treatment of menkes disease with copper has shown some promise in newborns having mutations that do not completely abrogate atp7a  <cit> . recent work in model systems has also demonstrated that host cell copper metabolism influences rna virus replication  <cit> , and leveraging copper’s cytotoxic properties is also being explored for cancer therapy, and may be effective in targeted killing of tumor cells  <cit> .

the ability of several compounds to increase copper concentrations in different cellular compartments was recently characterized  <cit> . we examined the effects of two of these compounds , on respiratory growth in yeast. consistent with our results in figure  <dig>  and with their ability to increase intracellular copper concentrations, both dsf and es conferred significant resistance to the copper chelating agent bcs . at the equivalent concentration , es was more effective than dsf in rescuing bcs-induced growth defects, an observation that is consistent with es having a stronger effect on intracellular copper concentrations in human cell lines  <cit> .

we next assessed the ability of dsf and es to rescue the effects of genetically-induced copper deprivation. our genomic screen identified the ctr1Δ/ctr1Δ strain, which lacks the primary copper transporter in yeast  <cit> , as being most aided by supplemental copper among the > <dig> strains tested . we found that dsf rescued the severe respiratory defect of this strain in a dose-dependent manner, with the strongest effect observed at  <dig>  μm dsf . es rescued growth of the ctr1Δ/ctr1Δ strain as well, and did so over a much broader concentration range, and at sub-nanomolar concentrations . comparable to the effects of cu, both drugs also increased respiratory growth of the parental by <dig> strain  suggesting that either drug could be used to correct a range of cu-deficiencies. it is noteworthy that while dsf inhibited growth at higher concentrations, es-induced growth inhibition was dependent on supplementing the media with cu , an observation that is consistent with previous findings  <cit> . when tested against several strains listed in table  <dig>  most strains were rescued by both es and dsf, but interestingly, neither drug rescued the respiratory growth defects of the gef1Δ/gef1Δ or ccc2Δ/ccc2Δ strains , which lack genes specifically required for loading cu into fet <dig>  these data suggest that, unlike cuso <dig> added to the growth media, dsf- and es-delivered copper require gef1- and ccc2-dependent cu loading into fet <dig> to confer enhanced growth.

es is a promising anti-cancer agent that induces oxidative stress in a copper-dependent manner  <cit> . dsf has been used for the treatment of alcoholism for decades  <cit>  and confers therapeutic value by inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase , which decreases the alcohol tolerance in patients  <cit> . dsf has also been shown to perturb vacuolar ph in yeast, and inhibit v-atpase activity in cell-free assays  <cit> . though our results clearly identify copper homeostasis as a rate-limiting effect of these drugs on respiratory growth, further experiments will be required to determine their precise mechanism-of-action. nevertheless, our data highlight the ability of copper ionophores to potently and precisely tune cellular fitness under copper-limiting conditions. leveraging the pharmacological tractability of copper homeostasis, though confronted with inherent cytoxicity obstacles, may warrant exploration as a therapeutic strategy for copper- or iron-deficiency in man.

CONCLUSIONS
a systematic screen of the yeast deletion collection was conducted to identify genes that have a role in cu-dependent respiratory fitness. the screen revealed a complex cellular system involving many genes that were not previously associated with copper homeostasis. the results are consistent with copper limitation producing a secondary iron deficiency that negatively impacts respiratory growth, and with the vacuole playing a vital role in regulating intracellular copper levels. roughly half of the genes identified in our screen are conserved in man, and many of these are associated with mendelian diseases, underscoring the potential translation of our findings to human health. pharmacological agents that increase intracellular copper concentrations can be effective in compensating for perturbations in copper homeostasis.
