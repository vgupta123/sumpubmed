BACKGROUND
vacuolar accumulation of anthocyanins in berry skin is responsible for the pigmentation of red/blue grapevine  cultivars. anthocyanin biosynthesis is developmentally triggered at the onset of berry ripening  and lasts till harvest  <cit> . expression profiling of structural genes and transcription factors has claimed a major role for the gene ufgt encoding a udp-glucose:flavonoid 3-o-glucosyltransferase and its regulatory myb-type gene vvmyba in conveying the flux of flavonoid intermediates towards the synthesis of anthocyanins  <cit> . the enzyme ufgt is synthesised since véraison under the control of vvmyba and catalyses the 3'-glycosidation of cyanidin- and delphinidin-based anthocyanidins  <cit> . the resulting stably coloured anthocyanins may undergo methylation upon the activity of methyl-transferases that convert cyanidin into peonidin and delphinidin into petunidin or malvidin, similarly to how it occurs in other anthocyanin-producing species  <cit> .

cyanidin- and delphinidin-derived anthocyanins diverge from each other regarding the number of the substituted groups that are found on the b-ring of the flavonoid skeleton  and have their chromatic properties affected accordingly. cyanidin-based anthocyanins exhibit a reddish colour whereas delphinidin-based anthocyanins are purple to blue. they jointly determine the tonality of red berry grape varieties and their corresponding wines. the relative proportion of the five anthocyanins is largely under genetic control and unique to each cultivar  <cit> . sunlight exposition and water deficit have been shown to modulate to some extent the anthocyanin profile  <cit> .

in plant species, the biosynthesis of cyanidin- and delphinidin-type precursors is driven, upstream of the enzyme ufgt, by the activity of two flavonoid 3'- and 3',5'-hydroxylases  that add either a single hydroxyl group at the 3' position or two hydroxyl groups at the 3' and 5' positions to dihydrokaempferol and/or dihydroquercetin. once converted into 3'-dihydroquercetin or 3',5'-dihydromyricetin, these intermediates flow through common downstream enzymes to form di-substituted and tri-substituted anthocyanins when the gene ufgt is expressed and to form other polyphenols  at different developmental stages. f3'h and f3',5'h genes code for cyp <dig> cytochrome p <dig> hydroxylases that have been well characterised in the ornamental plants antirrhinum majus  <cit> , campanula medium  <cit> , dianthus caryophyllus  <cit> , gentiana triflora  <cit> , ipomoea purpurea,  <cit> , petunia hybrida  <cit> , phalaenopsis  <cit>  and vinca major  <cit> . in all these species, f3'h and f3',5'h are found as low/medium copy number genes and have been genetically manipulated to produce novel flower pigmentation. in grapevine, only tentative consensus  sequences for f3'h and f3',5'h genes are available in the tigr grape gene database . tcs were built based on partially overlapping ests from cdna libraries obtained from different genotypes and tissues. this makes it unfeasible to predict or rule out the presence of different isogenes.

this paper reports  the isolation of flavonoid 3'- and 3',5'-hydroxylase gene members in grapevine via sequence homology,  the assessment of their chromosomal location by genetic and physical mapping,  their transcript profiles in different tissues,  the time-course of expression in berry skin of the red cultivar 'merlot' from pre-véraison to harvest compared to the curves of accumulation of anthocyanins, catechins and total polyphenols.

RESULTS
isolation of flavonoid 3'- and 3',5'-hydroxylase genes in grapevine
gene isolation was accomplished via sequence homology with the help of newly designed degenerate primers. pcr bands that were amplified from genomic dna of vitis vinifera 'cabernet sauvignon' were longer than predicted on the basis of plant flavonoid hydroxylase transcripts .

a degenerate iub code: i = inosine; r = a or g; m = a or c; w = a or t; y = c or t; s = c or g; d = a, g or t; n, a, c, g or t.

* in absence of introns.

five different sequences were isolated with the f3'h degenerate primers following sscp analysis and were given the designation vvf3'h-1a, -1b, -1c, -1d, and vvf3'h- <dig> . once the primer sites had been removed, the sequences vvf3'h-1a to -1d were  <dig>  bp long with a  <dig> bp intron; vvf3'h- <dig> was  <dig>  bp long with a  <dig> bp intron. sizing of genomic amplicons performed by capillary electrophoresis confirmed that the two classes of amplicons diverge from each other for a 23-bp indel. sequence identity was between  <dig>  and  <dig> %  among the sequences vvf3'h- <dig>  the presence of mutations introduced by taq polymerase during the pcr process and immortalised through the cloning of single pcr-amplified molecules could not be ruled out as the origin of differences among the four vvf3'h- <dig> sequences. the sequences vvf3'h-1a to -1d translated into protein fragments of  <dig> amino acids with  <dig> positions conserved among the sequences when pair-wise comparisons were performed . vvf3'h- <dig> contained a frame shift mutation due to a 23-bp deletion in the coding region. function was putatively assigned to vvf3'h- <dig> based on its highest identity match in genbank at the protein level  that corresponded to a flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase of petunia × hybrida . the nucleotide coding sequence of vvf3'h- <dig> matched the grapevine tentative consensus sequence tc <dig> that has been predicted from three partially overlapping ests sequenced in 'cabernet sauvignon' and 'chardonnay' . the vvf3'h- <dig> protein fragments spanned the 1– <dig> amino acid region of tc <dig> and extended it on the 5' end of the gene by  <dig> amino acids. amino acid sequence identity between the four vvf3'h- <dig> protein fragments and tc <dig> was 95–96%.

the degenerate primers targeting f3'5'h yielded five sequences that were given the designation vvf3'5'h-1a, -1b, -1c, vvf3'5'h-2a, -2b . once the degenerate primer sites had been removed, the sequences vvf3'5'h-1a, -1b and -1c were  <dig>  bp long with a  <dig> bp intron; vvf3'5'h-2a and vvf3'5'h-2b were  <dig>  bp long with a  <dig> bp intron. the translated coding region matched several plant f3'5'h genes in genbank. vvf3'5'h-1a, -1b and -1c shared the highest identity score at the amino acid level with the accession aap <dig> of gossypium hirsutum  as well as vvf3'5'h-2a and -2b did with the accession aam <dig> of glycine max . translated sequences of vvf3'5'h-1a and vvf3'5'h-1b diverged from each other for two out of  <dig> amino acids. the same occurred between the sequences vvf3'5'h-2a and vvf3'5'h-2b . the sequences vvf3'5'h-1a and vvf3'5'h-1b had 93–94% identity at the amino acid level with vvf3'5'h-2a and vvf3'5'h-2b. all sequences matched the tentative consensus tc <dig> obtained from  <dig> ests at the tigr grape gene index. the 'cabernet sauvignon' gene fragments identified in this work spanned the 187– <dig> amino acid region of tc <dig> over a predicted orf of  <dig> amino acids. the sequences vvf3'5'h-1a and vvf3'5'h-1b had 97% and 98% amino acid identity, respectively, with tc45860; vvf3'5'h-2a and vvf3'5'h-2b peptide sequences had 95% identity with tc <dig>  the vvf3'5'h gene fragments partially overlapped also with a est  of a 'cabernet sauvignon' berry cdna library already analysed by mpss . in order to predict how many functional copies of the gene vvf3'5'h are present in the grape genome we looked at the number of different ests available at the grape gene databases. twelve est singletons held at the tigr and the est ctg <dig> spanned the 5' end of the vvf3'5'h gene fragments whilst four ests were alignable to the 3' end. all  <dig> ests, irrespective of their tissue-specific localisation and the source genotype, were aligned with the 'cabernet sauvignon' genomic sequences vvf3'5'h-1a, -1b, -2a, -2b . six ests clustered with the 'cabernet sauvignon' vvf3'5'h-1a and vvf3'5'h-1b gene fragments. those ests were detected in leaves of the white variety 'chardonnay' and in petioles and berries of the red variety 'cabernet sauvignon'. eleven ests grouped together with the 'cabernet sauvignon' vvf3'5'h-2a and vvf3'5'h-2b genomic sequences. the latter ests were present in various tissues  of red  and white  cultivars. two major groups of f3'5'h transcripts including either vvf3'5'h- <dig> or vvf3'5'h- <dig> can be detected in different tissues of both red and white grapevines, suggesting that at least two genes encoding cyp75a cyt p <dig> hydroxylases are expressed in flavonoid-synthesizing tissues. due to the putative presence of snps in ests from different cultivars, it was not possible to ascertain the number of functional copies belonging to each group, but together with the number of highly similar sequences obtained from 'cabernet sauvignon' genomic dna, this pointed to the presence of multiple gene members coding for different isoforms of flavonoid hydroxylases in the grape genome.

in order to test the phylogenetic relationship between grapevine hydroxylases and the multi-functional family of plant monooxygenases, a neighbor-joining tree was constructed using translated sequences of vvf3'h, vvf3'5'h- <dig>  vvf3'5'h- <dig> and  <dig> protein entries of plant cyt p <dig> monooxygenases . vvf3'h and vvf3'5'h grouped solely with p <dig> proteins specifically annotated as flavonoid hydroxylases belonging to the family-specific branch of cyp <dig> monooxygenases. vvf3'h and vvf3'5'h split into two terminal branches, each one hosting either cyp75b or cyp75a monooxygenases. although most plant p450s are of polyphyletic origin and some p <dig> families are lineage-specific  <cit> , cyp <dig> p450s are ancient genes that existed even before the separation between gymnosperms and flowering plants  <cit> . the ancient origin of cyp <dig> monooxygenases is also supported by the finding that intron position of vvf3'h and vvf3'5'h was conserved when compared to other plant genes coding for flavonoid hydroxylases such as the arabidopsis gene tt <dig>  <cit> .

genetic mapping
genetic loci harbouring genes that code for flavonoid hydroxylases were mapped using the single strand conformational polymorphism  analysis of f3'h and f3'5'h sequences in an f <dig> pseudo-testcross mapping population originated from the cross 'cabernet sauvignon' vitis 'breeding line 20/3'. the two genes segregated independently and were mapped to linkage groups lg <dig> and lg <dig>  respectively . the linkage groups were annotated according to  <cit>  and included also reference microsatellite markers and sscp markers generated from bac end-sequences  of a 'cabernet sauvignon' bac library. the locus containing the gene that codes for flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase was identified by linkage analysis following the segregation of the sscp of two co-segregating bands amplified from the parent 'cabernet sauvignon' by means of the primer pair f3int . the vvf3'h locus mapped to the middle of lg <dig> and co-segregated with the bes marker 5a23-fm and the microsatellite marker vmc9g <dig>  the locus containing the genes that code for flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase was mapped by means of a polymorphic sscp band amplified from the parent 'cabernet sauvignon' using the primer pair f35-1int. this marker mapped to the middle of lg <dig> and co-segregated with microsatellite marker vrzag <dig> and bes markers 9c17-fm and 17k4-fm . other sscp bands that were co-amplified by the same primer pair f35-1int could not be scored in the progeny due to faintness or homozygosis. sscp marker f35-2int could not be mapped in the 'cabernet sauvignon' parental map, but co-segregated with vrzag <dig> and sscp marker f35-1int in the male parent of the same cross .

physical mapping and anchoring of bac contigs to the genetic map
a total of  <dig> bac clones containing the genes vvf3'h and vvf3'5'h were identified by screening a set of  <dig>  bacs corresponding to a 6x genome coverage  <cit> . the primer pair f <dig>  specific for grapevine flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase, detected  <dig>  gene copies per haploid genome equivalent. two bands of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, corresponding to the vvf3'h- <dig> and the vvf3'h- <dig> gene fragments, respectively, were co-amplified from all but two of the bacs, while the  <dig> bp band alone was amplified from the other two bac clones. the genes coding for flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylases were searched in the bac library using the primer pairs f35- <dig> and f35- <dig> . the primer pair f35- <dig>  specific for the genes vvf3'5'h- <dig>  identified five bac clones. the primer pair f35- <dig>  specific for vvf3'5'h- <dig>  identified two different bac clones. twelve additional bac clones were identified by both primer pairs. the number of positive bac clones per haploid genome equivalent was on average  <dig>  for the gene vvf3'5'h- <dig> and  <dig>  for the gene vvf3'5'h- <dig>  local physical maps around the vvf3'h and vvf3'5'h loci were constructed using all positive bac clones identified. those bac clones were used to query  <dig>  bac contigs resulting from a whole genome physical map. this map was assembled using fpc software  <cit>  at a 10- <dig> cut-off from  <dig>  fingerprints of bac clones derived from the same library and corresponding to an approximate coverage of 10x .

two flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase genes, vvf3'h- <dig> and vvf3'h- <dig>  were tightly linked in contig ctg <dig> that consisted of  <dig> bac clones and approximately covered  <dig> kb . six bac clones contained both isogenes, whilst two bac clones  contained only vvf3'h- <dig>  bac clone 5a <dig> was initially not included in the ctg <dig> following computational contig assembly because it did not meet the cut-off due to a low number of fingerprint bands. however, it was later placed in the contig upon pcr anchorage to other bac clones using the bes-derived primers . the same marker bes5a23-fm was used to anchor contig ctg <dig> to the 'cabernet sauvignon' genetic map. the marker based on the sscp of the vvf3'h gene fragments and the bes-derived marker co-segregated at the level of resolution of the genetic map.

flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase genes were present in four contigs  that covered approximately  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kb, respectively. each one of the contigs ctg <dig>  ctg <dig> and ctg <dig> contained both vvf3'5'h- <dig> and vvf3'5'h- <dig> gene fragments. contig ctg <dig> contained only the vvf3'5'h- <dig> gene fragment. contigs ctg <dig>  ctg <dig>  ctg <dig> and ctg <dig> included  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bac clones, respectively, of which  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, contained either one or both isoforms of flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylases as shown in figure  <dig>  vvf3'5'h- <dig> and vvf3'5'h- <dig> fragments were amplified from each individual positive bac clone of contigs ctg <dig>  ctg <dig>  ctg <dig> and ctg <dig> using the primers pairs f35-1int and f35-2int, respectively, and analyzed by the sscp technique.

based on bac order and the number of sscp haplotypes, at a first approximation we hypothesize the occurrence of four loci containing vvf3'5'h-1-type sequences and seven loci containing vvf3'5'h-2-type sequences over the four contigs . two paralogous copies of gene vvf3'5'h- <dig> were identified in ctg <dig>  the first paralog had two allelic variants, that could be detected by sscp analysis, one present in three bac clones 6h <dig>  9c <dig>  31p <dig>  and the other in the remaining five clones . two bac clones  spanned the region that included both paralogs. a third potential paralogous copy of the gene vvf3'5'h- <dig> was identified in contig ctg <dig> whose bac clones contained one of the two sscp haplotypes present in the bacs from contig ctg <dig>  an additional different haplotype of the gene vvf3'5'h- <dig> was identified in contig ctg <dig> that included just three bac clones. we could detect a potential of seven paralogous copies of the gene vvf3'5'h- <dig> in contigs ctg <dig>  ctg <dig>  ctg <dig> and ctg <dig>  the primers pair f35-2int identified three types of gene fragments distinguishable by size, hereafter referred to as short, medium and long . all three gene fragments were found in ctg <dig> in the close vicinity of the gene copy of vvf3'5'h- <dig>  three bac clones contained all three forms at the same time, confirming the paralogous nature of these vvf3'5'h- <dig> gene copies. the medium sized gene fragment vvf3'5'h- <dig> was also amplified in ctg <dig> and ctg <dig> where it showed a sscp haplotype different from that found in ctg <dig> . a different locus carrying the longer fragment of vvf3'5'h- <dig> was present in ctg <dig> with a sscp haplotype not distinguishable from that found in ctg <dig> 

integration of genetic and physical maps around the locus vvf3'5'h
contigs ctg <dig>  ctg <dig>  ctg <dig> and ctg <dig> were anchored to the 'cabernet sauvignon' genetic map by using ssr markers present in the bac clones and single strand conformational polymorphism of the bac-end sequences . the ssr marker vrzag <dig> that was identified in five bacs of ctg <dig> allowed this contig to be anchored to lg <dig>  map position of ctg <dig> was confirmed by mapping the sscp marker bes9c17-fm developed on a bac clone embedded into ctg <dig> that co-segregated with ssr vrzag <dig>  the contig ctg <dig> was anchored to lg <dig> by the ssr marker vmc3a <dig>  the contig ctg <dig> was anchored to lg <dig> using the ssr vmc3f <dig> and the bac end-derived sscp marker bes38c24-rm. the contig ctg <dig> was anchored to lg <dig> by the bac end-derived sscp marker bes17k4-fm. the sscp band of the marker bes17k04-fm inherited from 'cabernet sauvignon', which corresponded to the sscp band amplified from the bac clone 17k <dig>  was amplified in the mapping population and completely co-segregated with ssr vrzag <dig> and bes9c17-fm. the marker bes38c24-rm mapped  <dig>  cm apart from those three markers and co-segregated with ssr vmc3a <dig>  all contigs ctg <dig>  ctg <dig>  ctg <dig> and ctg <dig> were located on lg <dig> in the region covered by the markers vrzag <dig>  vmc3a <dig>  bes9c17-fm, bes17k4-fm and bes38c24-rm. this interval spanned  <dig>  cm in the 'cabernet sauvignon' parental map. contigs ctg <dig>  ctg <dig>  ctg <dig> were also cross-referenced to the v. vinifera consensus map  by the ssr markers vrzag <dig>  vmc3a <dig> and vmc3f <dig>  respectively. the region spanned  <dig>  cm and the median vmc3a <dig> marker was settled  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm away from vrzag <dig> and vmc3f <dig>  respectively .

the bes of positive bac clones provided new markers that were closely linked to the flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase gene copies and served to characterize that region more precisely. the marker bes9c17-fm was located on the physical map downstream of ssr vrzag <dig> and identified only bac clones belonging to the contig ctg <dig>  bes38c24-rm matched uniquely the bac clones 38c <dig> and 21h <dig> belonging to ctg <dig>  conversely, bes40a22-fm and bes38c24-fm primers were designed on bes belonging to ctg <dig> and ctg <dig>  respectively, but cross-identify bac clones assembled in both contigs. sscp analysis of bes40a22-fm and bes38c24-fm fragments revealed that for each marker two haplotypes are present in ctg <dig> and two different haplotypes are present in ctg <dig>  yet, marker bes17k04-fm matched bacs 6h <dig>  9c <dig> and 31p <dig> of ctg <dig> and bacs 29j <dig>  38c <dig>  4k <dig>  30k <dig> of ctg <dig>  sscp analysis identified four different haplotypes at the regions amplified by bes17k04-fm primers: two haplotypes were detected in the bac clones of ctg <dig>  one more different haplotype was present in ctg <dig>  and yet another sscp haplotype was found in both bac17k <dig> and bac24n <dig> belonging to ctg <dig>  the occurrence of more than two haplotypes of the flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase gene fragments and of the bes markers in a diploid genotype confirmed the presence of paralogous copies of the flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase genes and rule out the possibility that the individual contigs represent allelic regions that have not been properly assembled. a segmental duplication spanning the markers f35-1int, f35-2int, bes40a22-fm, bes17k04-fm and bes38c24-fm that occurred within  <dig> - <dig>  cm on lg <dig> could explain the physical organization of flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase isogenes as it has been outlined in figure  <dig>  the contig ctg <dig> that comprised only three bac clones could not be unambiguously positioned in relation to the other contigs. bes markers from the other contigs did not match any bac clones of ctg <dig> but marker bes17k04-fm matched both ctg <dig> and ctg <dig>  marker bes17k04-fm is therefore located within the segmental duplication. it remains uncertain whether ctg <dig> partially overlaps the region of ctg <dig> and split from it due to high heterozygosity or if it actually covers an adjacent locus. under the assumption of bac alignment between bac clones 9c <dig> and 17k <dig> that is supported by genetic co-segregation of the corresponding bes and by co-amplification by marker bes17k04-fm, ctg <dig> would carry the haplotype allelic to bacs 6h <dig>  9c <dig>  31p <dig> at the bes17k04-fm sscp marker and the vvf3'5'h- <dig> gene fragment present in bac17k <dig> would miss a counterpart on the homologous chromosome. otherwise, ctg <dig> would identify a forth different locus of vvf3'5'h- <dig>  located in the surrounding region and under-represented among the bac clones of the library.

based on the data available to us, we propose that the chromosomal region spanning the vvf3'5h gene cluster includes four copies of vvf3'5'h- <dig> and five to seven copies of vvf3'5'h- <dig>  all sharing a high sequence similarity. we were able to present a preliminary physical map of this cluster of genes by a combination of computational assembly of fingerprinted bacs and by pcr-based alignment of bac clones. the region has likely originated from both tandem duplications that generated nearby gene copies  and from segmental intrachromosomal duplications involving a larger block of dna . segmental duplications are an important source of gene evolution  <cit>  and they have been estimated to cover  <dig> – <dig> % of the mouse genome  <cit>  and 4% of the human genome  <cit> . in the rat genome, duplicated genes are largely confined into < <dig> mb intrachromosomal duplications rather than widely interspersed through the genome  <cit> . a similar model of genome dynamics could also have shaped plant genomes as it is emerging for model species  <cit> .

expression analysis of vvf3'h and vvf3'5'h along with major structural genes of the flavonoid pathway in different grape tissues
the genes encoding both flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase and flavonoid 3'-5'-hydroxylases are widely expressed in grapevine organs . transcripts of gene vvf3'h- <dig> were detected in all tissues tested. vvf3'h- <dig> was strongly expressed in green apical leaflets and flowers but it was only slightly detectable in fully expanded leaves. it was also present in all berry tissues. the other sequence vvf3'h- <dig>  which translated into a truncated flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase due to a 23-bp frameshift deletion, was apparently not expressed and is likely to be a pseudogene.

transcripts of vvf3'5'h- <dig> were present in all tissues. high levels of expression were detected in pigmented apical leaflets, flowers, seeds and berries but not in green fully expanded leaves and roots. differential expression could be detected between green berry skin and red berry skin, the expression being higher in pigmented berry skin. the expression pattern of vvf3'5'h- <dig> mimicked the expression profile of chs <dig>  chs <dig> and the gene coding for flavanone hydroxylase . the gene vvf3'5'h- <dig> expressed transcripts of different size that could be distinguished on agarose gel . the two shorter bands were invariantly present in all tissues, even though at a different level of expression. the longest band was strongly expressed only in red berry skin, whilst it was slightly detectable in seeds and not detectable at all in other tissues.

the expression of most flavonoid genes, including those coding for flavonoid hydroxylases, was more intensively activated in flowers and seeds than in other organs. seeds expressed all isoforms of the flavonoid hydroxylase genes identified in this work, whilst all but vvf3'5'h-2-long were expressed in flowers. among berry tissues, flesh poorly expressed the genes of the flavonoid pathway, except for ban, vvf3'h- <dig>  vvf3'5'h- <dig>  vvf3'5'h-2-short and vvf3'5'h-2-medium. in the epicarp of berries collected at different developmental stages, fls <dig> and ban were more expressed at the pre-véraison stage; chs <dig>  f3h and vvf3'5'h- <dig> were induced in red skin compared to green skin; ufgt, vvf3'h- <dig> and vvf3'5'h-2-long were strongly expressed in red skin but were undetectable in green skin.

the flavonoid pathway does not exclusively lead to the synthesis of anthocyanins and several flavonoid hydroxylase isogenes were therefore expressed also in non-pigmented tissues. berry flesh and seeds accumulate non-anthocyanin flavonoids such as proanthocyanidins and catechins. their synthesis is catalysed downstream of the flavonoid hydroxylases by the genes dfr, ldox and ban. gene ban was strongly expressed in seeds, berry flesh and berry skin at pre-véraison, whilst was almost undetectable in post-véraison berry skin at the stage when the rate of accumulation of proanthocyanins and catechins is declining . sunlight exposed tissues expressed the gene coding for flavonol synthase . flavonol synthase converts the products of flavonoid hydroxylases into the uv-protecting flavonols. inner tissues  and underground organs  did not exhibit detectable levels of fls <dig> 

expression profiling of flavonoid hydroxylase genes in skin of ripening berries
the time-course of expression of flavonoid hydroxylase genes in the red-skinned cultivar 'merlot' revealed that gene vvf3'h- <dig> is expressed throughout ripening. high transcript levels were detected from the first sampling date at the stage when catechins are rapidly synthesised and peak at  <dig>  mg g- <dig> of berry skin . vvf3'h- <dig> expression decreased 8– <dig> weeks after blooming, at the ripening stage when most genes committed to the flavonoid pathway have been reported to level off  <cit> . vvf3'h- <dig> transcripts increased soon after, at the onset of véraison , which were at that point in time 2-fold higher in red berries than in green berries collected from the same bunch. vvf3'h- <dig> expression lasted till harvest, with a secondary peak of expression one week before harvest, concurrently at the peak of anthocyanin content.

the gene vvf3'5'h- <dig> was weakly expressed during the earliest ripening stages. at the onset of véraison, transcripts of vvf3'5'h- <dig> were poorly detectable in green berries, while they increased 50-fold in berries that had already turned red within the same bunch. the peak of vvf3'5'h- <dig> expression corresponded to august 24th, at the stage when all berries had turned red. as described for vvf3'h- <dig>  a weaker peak of expression was found one week before harvest. expression of vvf3'5'h- <dig> was checked by semi-quantitative pcr because the different isoforms of this gene were distinguishable by size . transcripts of the isoforms vvf3'5'h-2-long and vvf3'5'h-2-medium did appear at the onset of véraison and lasted till full ripening, whilst the isogene vvf3'5'h-2-short was constitutively expressed throughout the ripening.

accumulation, composition of anthocyanins and colour evolution in berry skin during the progress of ripening
biometric and analytical parameters have been used to follow the progress of ripening . the onset of ripening began on august 3rd when sugars started to accumulate and acidity commenced to decline. the onset of véraison  was considered as the time when 10% of the berries had turned red . bunches went through this phase of colour transition until august 24th when all berries had turned red . anthocyanins have been detected by hplc analysis since the onset of véraison on august 12th . the accumulation of anthocyanins lasted until september 20th, one week before harvest , slightly decreasing at harvest .

at the earliest stage of the véraison, cyanidin-based anthocyanins  were roughly as abundant as delphinidin-based anthocyanins  . then, on august 24th the percentage of delphinidin-based anthocyanin  peaked simultaneously with the highest level of expression of vvf3'5'h- <dig>  the fraction of tri-substituted anthocyanins slightly decreased in the following weeks , then remaining substantially unchanged until harvest . berry skin colour moderately varied from h° =  <dig> , c* =  <dig>  to h° =  <dig>  c* =  <dig>  from september 2nd to september 28th. anthocyanin composition in berry skin changed over the period of véraison, from the onset of colour transition till whole-bunch pigmentation, but remained roughly unmodified throughout the last four weeks of ripening. although the anthocyanin profile of 'merlot' was largely composed by malvidin and tri-substituted anthocyanins at harvest, derivatives of cyanidin were more promptly synthesised at the very early stage of véraison. the pattern of expression of vvf3'h- <dig>  vvf3'5'h- <dig> and vvf3'5'h- <dig> is thus compatible with the hypothesis that they are strongly involved in the synthesis of the different types of anthocyanins and they affect anthocyanin composition in berry skin.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that genes coding for flavonoid 3'- and 3',5'-hydroxylases are present as low/medium copy members in the grapevine genome and are organised in complex gene clusters that most likely resulted from gene duplication and intra-chromosomal segmental duplication. these genes are expressed in coordination with other genes of the flavonoid pathway in any tissues of the grape plant that are known to accumulate flavonoids, such as leaves, flowers, roots, seeds and, particularly, in skin of ripening berries. rt-pcr showed a strong relationship between the expression of vvf3'h- <dig> and vvf3'5'h and the kinetics of accumulation of cyanidin- and delphinidin-based anthocyanins in the red-skinned variety 'merlot'. the presence of multiple putative 3',5'-hydroxylase isogenes which emerged from fine structural analysis at physical level, has first been shown for plant hydroxylases. this complexity was not unexpected for species like grape which synthesize large amounts of different classes of polyphenols and display a continuous variation of berry skin colour from brick red to dark blue among the so called red-skinned cultivars.
