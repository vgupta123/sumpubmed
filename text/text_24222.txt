BACKGROUND
acinetobacter baumannii is an important gram-negative nosocomial pathogen often associated with severe nosocomial infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infections, bacteremia and septicemia, especially in patients hospitalized in intensive care units  <cit> . a. baumannii is highly resistant to several antimicrobial agents, conferred mainly by intrinsic expression of cephalosporinase and efflux pumps, and by formation of biofilms  <cit> . the biofilms of a. baumannii lead to a reduction in the accumulation of antibiotics in the biofilm polymeric matrix  <cit> . biofilms are also associated with survival properties, virulence expression and bacterial communication  <cit> . recent studies indicate biofilm development is related to quorum sensing. quorum sensing is an important global regulatory system in bacteria that provides a mechanism to coordinate the behavior of individual bacteria in a population  <cit> . biofilms provide a tertiary structure for bacterial communication mediated by quorum sensing pathways. a number of signaling molecules with the ability to modulate quorum sensing-dependen enzymes are known as regulators for biofilm formation  <cit> . in gram-negative species, acyl-homoserine lactones  are mainly employed as autoinducers used by bacteria to control biofilm formation and maintenance  <cit> . along with many kinds of ahls, the production of c6-hsl was previously found in a. baumannii clinical isolates  <cit> , and most acinetobacter strains showed very weak degradation activity against c6-hsl  <cit> .

pili of a. baumannii are encoded by the csua/babcde chaperone-usher assembly system, which is controlled by a two-component regulatory system encoded by bfms and bfmr. it was previously shown that bfmr is essential for stabilization of csu operon expression and the expression of csuc and csue genes is involved in the initial surface attachment during biofilm formation  <cit> . these data suggest a. baumannii pili are a key factor in biofilm formation. although quorum sensing and bacterial pili have been implicated in a. baumannii biofilm formation, there is very little known about the mechanism surrounding these signal molecules, csua/babcde-mediated pili and biofilms in a. baumannii. in this study, an analysis of the processes of pili production and surface attachment of a. baumannii atcc <dig> was initiated, including the associated gene expression of csua/babcde chaperone-usher complex and their regulating genes . in addition, we present evidence for a possible role of quorum sensing signaling molecules in the formation of biofilms on abiotic surfaces.

RESULTS
impact of c6-hsl on chaperone-usher complex expression
the capacity of a. baumannii to form biofilms is a decisive advantage for its survival in the hospital environmental. recent studies have linked biofilm development with quorum-sensing pathways and bacterial factors, such as a. baumannii pili  <cit> . it is known that disruption of the csuc and csue orfs, which belong to the csua/babcde bacterial pili structure gene cluster, results in non-piliated cells and abolishes cell attachment  <cit> . however, the exact mechanism of how qs pathways and csu influence biofilm formation is unclear. to directly examine all the genetic components of the csua/babcde, and their regulators, the bfms-bfmr regulating system that includes response factor  and sensor kinase , we provide data on the comprehensive expression of the pili structure gene cluster and the impact of c6-hsl on this chaperone-usher secretion system. our results showed expression of bacterial pili structure genes, including csua/b, csua, csub, csuc, csud and csue, significantly increased after addition of 100 μmol/l c6-hsl, and the transcript levels of the csua/babcde chaperone-usher complex were increased > <dig> -fold over the control group . furthermore, at the same experimental conditions, expression of chaperone-usher regulators  were higher than those of the control strain, and the regulators were increased approx  <dig> -fold .figure  <dig>

subsurface twitching motility and transmission electron microscopy
despite the lack of flagella, a. baumannii can spread rapidly over surfaces, probably due to twitching motility  <cit> . twitching is a form of surface motility mediated by type iv pili  <cit> . in pseudomonas aeruginosa, twitching has been implicated in biofilm development  <cit>  and a correlation has been found between twitching motility activity and biofilm production  <cit> . to determine whether c6-hsl affects bacterial twitching motility, we performed a subsurface twitching assay at the agar/glass interface comparing the diameter of twitching motility zones between the control group and a. baumannii treated with 100 μmol/l of c6-hsl. the results showed that a. baumannii co-cultured with 100 μmol/l c6-hsl had markedly increased movement from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm in 24 hours , which may result from enhanced twitching motility. transmission electron microscopy  was used to confirm that pili formation in a. baumannii cells was stimulated by c6-hsl. the tem showed there were abundant pili-like structures around the bacteria treated with c6-hsl, while structures of pili were not observed on the top of the control bacterial cells .figure  <dig>

confocal laser scanning microscopy
if the increase in expression of bacterial pili seen in a. baumannii in response to c6-hsl is responsible for enhanced twitching motility, maintaining this quorum sensing stimulation in pili expression should obviously increase the capacity of the bacteria to form biofilms. with 100 μmol/l c6-hsl conditions, a. baumannii atcc <dig> was shown to form mature biofilms faster than the control group grown in mh medium, which yielded undeveloped biofilms. the results of the confocal laser scanning microscopy  show the total fluorescence intensity of biofilms significantly increased in the c6-hsl group and the pili assembling from the surface of the cell was more abundant after c6-hsl stimulation .figure  <dig>

a recent study  <cit>  reported that a strain of a. baumannii with a bfms knockout displayed a reduction in biofilm formation, loss of adherence to eukaryotic cells and greater sensitivity to serum killing. our results demonstrated the expression of bfms and bfmr regulated their target genes, the family of csua/babcde chaperone-usher secretion system genes, to produce and assemble bacterial pili. taken together, the result that the csua/babcde chaperone-usher secretion system was essential to bacterial loci encoding secretion and surface motility  combined with our twitching assay results led us to conclude c6-hsl may promote a. baumannii pilus biosynthesis and assembly, as well as strain twitching ability, thereby ensuing formation of biofilms. however, qs signaling molecules are chemically diverse and many bacteria possess more than one ahl synthase  <cit> . in a. baumannii, many other qs signaling molecules have been verified, such as 3-oxo-c12-hsl, 3-hydroxy-c12-hsl and c8-hsl  <cit> . it is important to keep in mind that we focused only on the impact of c6-hsl on a. baumannii, which limited our study. in the future, it would be important to test other ahls commonly produced by a. baumannii and other bacteria.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we provided data demonstrating how, increased expression of bfms and bfmr, the qs signaling molecule c6-hsl enhanced expression of the chaperone-usher secretion system, and that bacterial pili are required for twitching motility in a. baumannii. furthermore, the concomitant pili expression and strain twitching allowed a. baumannii to easily attach to abiotic surfaces and form biofilms at an earlier timepoint. qs signaling molecules are required for cell attachment to solid surfaces and the development of biofilms. our study describes the biofilm formation of a. baumannii in response to a qs signaling molecule, a finding that provides a comprehensive insight into the role of bacterial pili, which play a key role in bacterial biofilm development.
