BACKGROUND
redox homeostasis is a fundamental requirement for the maintenance of metabolism. intracellular redox potential is determined principally by the ratio of nadh/nad+ and nadph/nadp+ cofactors, which are involved in about  <dig> reactions in saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> . these metabolites are interconnected by many different pathways. any change to intracellular redox balance therefore has far-reaching effects on the metabolic network. redox engineering strategies thus often have wide-ranging effects on metabolism  <cit> . a better understanding of the way in which yeast efficiently adjusts its metabolic fluxes in response to genetic or environmental redox changes is therefore essential for the prediction and control of these effects.

we recently investigated the response to increases in nadph oxidation using a biological system in which nadph demand can be specifically and gradually modified  <cit> . this system involves the culture of a strain overexpressing an engineered nadph-dependent bdh1p enzyme in the presence of acetoin . we analyzed the effect of four levels of nadph demand  on intracellular flux, through the use of a constraint-based approach based on dynamoyeast, a dedicated stoichiometric model of s. cerevisiae during fermentation  <cit> . the pentose phosphate pathway  and the acetate synthesis pathway  satisfied  <dig> and 20%, respectively, of the nadph demand when this demand was increased to up to  <dig> times the anabolic requirement. if demand was increased still further , the pp pathway was saturated and our model predicted a role for the glycerol-dha cycle, which exchanges nadp+ and nadh for nad+ and nadph, at the expense of one atp molecule .

despite these significant advances in our understanding of nadph metabolism, little is known about the mechanisms regulating nadph homeostasis. it is generally thought that the pentose phosphate pathway is controlled principally at the enzymatic level, with nadph and atp competitively inhibiting both the glucose- <dig> phosphate dehydrogenase zwf1p and the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gnd1p  <cit> . the coordinated regulation of genes involved in nadph metabolism, including most of pp pathway genes, has been reported in conditions of oxidative stress. the activation of nadph-dependent genes involves stb5p, a zinc-binding factor  <cit> , which also represses the expression of pgi <dig>  encoding the phosphoglucose isomerase at the junction between glycolysis and the pp pathway. this transcription factor plays a key role in rerouting carbon flux to provide the additional nadph required for the response to oxidative stress, as demonstrated by the greater susceptibility of the stb5Δ mutant to several chemicals and oxidants  <cit>  and by the greater resistance to diamide of a strain overexpressing stb <dig> <cit> . stb5p was also recently shown to be essential for acetaldehyde tolerance  <cit>  and, under anaerobic conditions, to play a major role in the maintenance of basal flux through the pp pathway  <cit> .

high-throughput experiments and metabolic modeling are powerful approaches for studying the global response of cells to environmental changes and identifying the regulatory mechanisms involved in the rerouting of the metabolic network. we analyzed the transcriptome, extracellular and intracellular metabolites and metabolic fluxes, to identify the regulatory mechanisms involved in the response of yeast cells to various increases in nadph oxidation. we found that redox homeostasis was maintained principally through metabolic control, with regulation of the transcription of certain genes of the pp pathway occurring at higher levels of nadph demand. we also observed a general increase in the expression of genes involved in amino-acid synthesis, particularly those involved in the synthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids, as an indirect response to the lower availability of nadph.

RESULTS
transcriptomic response to changes in nadph and nadh demands
we investigated the contribution of genetic control to the response to an increase in nadph oxidation, by carrying out a microarray analysis of nadph-bdh cells with various levels of nadph demand, achieved by adding  <dig>   <dig> or 300 mm acetoin to the growth medium. these conditions increase nadph demand by factors of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, with respect to the anabolic demand  <cit> . we cultured the nadh-bdh strain in the presence of 200 mm acetoin, both as a control and to assess the specificity of the effect on nadph demand. trancriptome analysis was performed with rna samples extracted from cells harvested at mid-exponential growth phase when the amount of cumulative co <dig> release was 6 g/l . all the strains grew at the same rate, except nadph-bdh in the presence of 300 mm acetoin, which had a growth rate decreased by 60% . at this time point, strains exposed to different degrees of change in nadph demand differed in their acetate  production   <cit> .

we carried out multitest with a modified t-test, using a false-discovery rate of  <dig> x 10- <dig> and a threshold of a  <dig> -fold change to identify genes displaying significant differences in mrna levels between conditions in which nadph demand was modified and control  conditions . the number of genes displaying differential expression clearly increased with the degree to which nadph demand was modified . in the presence of 100 mm acetoin, only eight genes displayed a change in expression level, whereas  <dig> genes were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated in the presence of 200 mm acetoin and  <dig> genes were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated in the presence of 300 mm acetoin. changes in nadh demand had little overall effect on gene expression, as only  <dig> genes were differentially regulated. this suggests that the response to an increase in nadh demand to four times  or in nadph to eight times  the amount required for anabolism  <cit>  mostly involved metabolic control.

we began our study of the transcriptional response to altered nadph demand, by carrying out a biological process gene-ontology search to characterize the nadph response and to identify the processes involved at various levels of nadph demand. a comparison of the gene transcript profiles of cells subjected to the modification of nadph demand  showed that many of the genes upregulated were involved in amino-acid biosynthesis and sulfate assimilation pathways. in particular, genes involved in the synthesis of methionine, cysteine, serine and lysine were overexpressed, whereas the expression of only two of these genes  was modified by nadh oxidation. the upregulated genes were significantly enriched in stress-responsive genes from the seripauperin family and genes encoding ribosomal proteins. for the ribosomal protein genes at least, this may be due to differences in the phase of protein synthesis and nitrogen use, as transcriptome analysis was carried out at similar levels of co <dig> production, but not necessarily at the same physiological stage. the decreased growth rate of nadph-bdh strain in the condition 300 mm acetoin did not affect the transcriptome as genes typically responding to differences in growth rate  <cit>  were not found differentially expressed. in conditions in which nadph demand was strongly modified, several nadh-dependent oxidoreductases were upregulated .

the repressed genes included adh <dig>  which encodes an nadh-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase. this gene displayed the highest level of repression, by a factor of  <dig> at an acetoin concentration of 200 mm and a factor of  <dig> at an acetoin concentration of 300 mm. adh <dig> was also downregulated  in response to the modulation of nadh levels. these results suggest that the product of the adh <dig> gene is involved in redox homeostasis. adh4p is generally thought to make use of nad+, but the role, distribution within the cell and cofactor specificity of this enzyme remain unclear  <cit> .

at an acetoin concentration of 300 mm, several genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and alcoholic fermentation, such as pgm2emi2gph1hxk1pdc <dig> and pdc <dig>  were repressed. pgm <dig> is involved in the production of udp-glucose, a precursor of trehalose and trehalose-6-phosphate   <cit> , whereas gph <dig> and, probably, emi <dig> are involved in glycogen catabolism. by contrast, pdc <dig> was upregulated in conditions in which nadh levels were modified.

pathways involved in nadph synthesis
in our previous model-based data reconciliation analysis of the response to nadph demand modulation, we showed that yeast cells responded to increases in nadph demand by increasing flux through the pp and acetate pathways, which covered 80% and 20% of the nadph demand, respectively  <cit> . no effect on the expression of genes involved in acetate production  or the pdh-by pass was observed, other than the repression of pdc genes. by contrast, several genes of the pp pathway were upregulated in response to increasing nadph demand . gnd <dig> and sol <dig> were induced when a moderate increase in nadph demand was imposed . in the conditions in which nadph demand was highest , two genes of the nonoxidative part of the pp pathway, tkl <dig> and tal <dig>  were also upregulated. by contrast, the expression of shb <dig> encoding the enzyme sedoheptulose- <dig>  biphosphatase recently found to be involved in riboneogenesis, a pathway that converts glycolytic intermediates into ribose-5-phosphate without production of nadph  <cit> , was not affected by redox perturbations.

nadp-consuming pathways
one major response to increasing demand for nadph was the activation of many genes of the sulfate assimilation pathway, which mediates the conversion of so42− to methionine, s-adenosylmethionine  and cysteine . this response was progressive, with the number of genes displaying changes in expression and the intensity of induction increasing with increasing nadph demand. the entire sulfate assimilation pathway was overexpressed in the presence of 300 mm acetoin. in addition, several genes of the lysine synthesis pathway, lys <dig>  lys <dig> and lys <dig> were upregulated, as well as two genes encoding the first enzyme of the serine synthesis pathway, ser <dig> and ser <dig> .

several of the downregulated genes are linked to the sulfate assimilation pathway: sam <dig>  which encodes a permease required for sam utilization, and tpo <dig>  which encodes an h+ transporter involved in exporting the spermidine produced from sam. another gene, qdr <dig> encodes a multidrug transporter activated in response to the limitation of amino-acid synthesis  <cit> .

genes encoding several other oxidoreductases, such as adh7ari <dig>  gnd <dig>  ydr541c , mdh <dig>  idh <dig> and aad <dig>  were also upregulated in response to changes in nadph demand. adh <dig> showed the highest level of variation of these genes. it was overexpressed by a factor of  <dig> in the presence of 200 mm acetoin and by a factor of up to  <dig> in the presence of 300 mm acetoin. adh <dig> encodes an nadh-dependent, medium-chain length alcohol dehydrogenase with broad substrate specificity thought to be involved in the accumulation of fusel alcohols, in lignin degradation and in the detoxification of furfural  <cit> . ari <dig> encoding an intermediate-subclass short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase that can use aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes as substrates and that contributes to the detoxification of furfural  <cit> , was also strongly induced  in the presence of  <dig> and 300 mm acetoin.

despite the dependence of the corresponding enzymes on nadph, adh <dig> and ari <dig> were also induced when nadh levels were modified, albeit to a lesser extent. one possible reason for this is that the changes in nadh levels also affected nadph/nadp+ balance. indeed, we previously suggested that a cycle exchanging nadph for nadh operated in strain nadh-bdh and that the activity of this cycle was increased by nadh oxidation, with the overall effect of decreasing nadph availability  <cit> . this would account for the induction of adh <dig> and ari <dig> by changes in nadh levels.

rerouting metabolic flux in response to increases in nadph demand
fluxomics and metabolomics are powerful methods for the quantitative analysis of cell metabolism. we used 13 c flux analysis to estimate the distribution of intracellular carbon flux in the 59a and nadph-bdh strains cultured under the same conditions as for the transcriptomic analysis, but in smaller volumes . the most striking change in flux distribution  was a gradual increase in the flux through the pp pathway with increasing nadph demand, by factors  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the presence of  <dig>   <dig> and 300 mm acetoin respectively, compared to control conditions . this confirms experimentally the progressive increase through the pp pathway flux  previously predicted by the dynamoyeast constraint-based model in the same conditions  <cit> . we also observed a decrease in fluxes toward biomass and in fluxes toward anabolic precursors, such as cytosolic and mitochondrial pyruvate, acetyl-coa, oxaloacetate and α-ketoglutarate, consistent with the lower growth rates in conditions of high nadph demand . consequently, the pp pathway made a greater contribution to the formation of fructose 6-phosphate  and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate  .

other changes in flux partitioning were observed at the pyruvate and acetaldehyde nodes. at these junctions, carbons were rerouted toward the formation of acetaldehyde and acetate, whereas flux through acetyl-coa synthase decreased. these findings suggest an increase in the contribution of nadph acetaldehyde dehydrogenase  to the provision of cytosolic nadph  and are consistent with the increase in acetate production observed .

effects of an increase in nadph oxidation on intracellular metabolites
we obtained a complementary view of metabolic regulation established in response to changes in nadph demand, by determining the concentrations of  <dig> intracellular metabolites of the central carbon metabolism by ie-ms/ms, in the nadph-bdh strain cultured in the presence of  <dig>   <dig> and 300 mm acetoin, under the same conditions as for the transcriptomic analysis. we focused on the amounts of intracellular intermediates of the pp and glycolytic pathways . the metabolite pools were clearly of similar sizes in the presence of  <dig> and 200 mm acetoin, but differed significantly in size in the presence of 300 mm acetoin, consistent with a major shift in metabolism to deal with these extreme conditions  <cit> . the intracellular concentrations of 6-phosphogluconate and of all intermediates of the nonoxidative part of the pp pathway were two to three times higher than those at lower acetoin concentrations, consistent with the increase in flux through the pp pathway. by contrast, the concentration of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate  decreased, consistent with the preferential rerouting of carbons through the nonoxidative part of pp pathway, at the expense of the purine and pyrimidine synthesis pathways.

we also determined the concentrations of nucleotides. the concentrations of the triphosphates decreased in response to increasing nadph demand, by factors of  <dig>  for atp and  <dig>  for utp. by contrast, those of the monophosphate forms increased, by a factor of  <dig> for amp and  <dig>  for ump. the glycolytic intermediates glucose 6-phosphate  and f6p accumulated, whereas the concentrations of g3p,  <dig> -fructose-biphosphate  and fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate  were similar at all levels of nadph demand.

the udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase  is involved in the synthesis of udp-glucose, a precursor of reserve carbohydrates, from glucose-1-phosphate . the accumulation of g1p observed in the presence of 300 mm acetoin may reflect a limitation of the flux through ugp1p, due to a decrease in utp availability.

an accumulation of 2-phosphoglycerate and 3-phosphoglycerate  was also observed.

impact of changes in nadph and nadh availability on aroma compounds
the formation of volatile compounds during fermentation is strongly influenced by redox status and may provide an overall picture of redox modifications in central carbon metabolism . we therefore investigated the impact of changes in nadph and nadh availability on key aromatic markers . acetaldehyde accumulated in large amounts, but only in response to changes in nadh levels , whereas acetate accumulated in response to changes in the availability of either nadh or nadph . the increase in acetaldehyde release therefore probably reflects limitation of the alcohol dehydrogenase reaction at low nadh availability. by contrast, increases in nadph demand resulted in the rerouting of carbons towards acetate, to satisfy this demand .

n.d. not determined.

increases in the oxidation of nadh or nadph  decreased the overall production of ethyl esters, which are generated by the condensation of ethanol and a fatty acid derivative. however, the ethyl acetate production did increase , consistent with the observed increase in acetate concentration . by contrast, acetate esters, which are produced by the condensation of a higher alcohol and acetyl-coa, did not change significantly in abundance, with the exception of isoamyl acetate in response to the greatest level of nadph demand. the production of fusel alcohols was increased in response to altered nadh demand, but unaffected by the modification of nadph demand. the level of isobutanol production was  <dig>  times higher in cells in which nadh levels were modified than in control cells. in line with this, the most significant effect of nadh oxidation was a large increase in isobutyl acetate production. similarly, the synthesis of propanol doubled in response to nadh oxidation but was unaffected by increases in nadph oxidation . finally, nadph oxidation tripled phenylethanol production. the precursor of this higher alcohol is erythrose-4-phosphate, an intermediate of the pp pathway. this result is therefore consistent with an increase in flux through the pp pathway .

discussion
we investigated the molecular processes involved in the maintenance of intracellular nadph homeostasis, by studying the fluxomic, metabolic and transcriptional responses to increases in nadph oxidation in s. cerevisiae. the biological system used, which was based on the overproduction of an nadph-dependent bdh1p enzyme and the use of acetoin as an electron acceptor, made it possible to impose unprecedented levels of redox disturbance on yeast cells, corresponding to  <dig> times the anabolic demand for nadph  <cit> .

we previously showed using constraint based metabolic flux analysis  that  yeast responds to increases in nadph demand by increasing the flux through the two main nadph-producing pathways   for nadph demands of more than  <dig> times the anabolic demand, the pp pathway was saturated and additional nadph was produced through the glycerol-dhap cycle, involving exchanges of the nadh and nadph redox cofactors. in this study, we characterized the mechanisms involved in flux rerouting for two moderate  and one large  increase in nadph, corresponding to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> times the anabolic nadph demand, respectively. in these conditions, little effect on growth was observed only for the two highest levels of nadph demand, consistent with a decrease in biomass synthesis due to a lack of nadph.

regulatory mechanisms involved in the rerouting of carbon to nadph-producing pathways
we combined 13 c-based metabolic flux, intracellular metabolite and global gene expression analyses, to investigate the way in which yeast adjusts its metabolism to respond to a high nadph demand. we first confirmed experimentally that carbon was rerouted principally to the acetate and the pp pathways for the generation of nadph. flux through the pp pathway, which was estimated by 13 c-flux analysis, was increased by factors of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the presence of  <dig>   <dig> and 300 mm acetoin, respectively, consistent with the predictions of the dynamoyeast model  <cit> .

we showed that the response of yeast to an increase in nadph demand to eight times the anabolic demand was mediated mostly by metabolic control, as no transcriptional regulation of the genes involved in the acetate and pp pathways was observed. however, further increases in nadph demand resulted in the induction of several pp pathway genes: sol <dig> and gnd <dig> in the presence of 200 mm and 300 mm acetoin and, in the presence of 300 mm acetoin, another two genes, tal <dig> and tkl <dig>  these genes were probably upregulated to increase the flux capacity of the pp pathway, which was limited in these conditions. indeed, the accumulation of 6-phosphogluconate and of all intermediates of the nonoxidative part of the pp pathway  suggests that the activities of 6-phosphogluconolactonase or 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, catalyzed by sol3p and gnd1p, and of enzymes of the nonoxidative part of the pathway become limiting.

both metabolic and genetic controls are therefore required to cover a demand for nadph more than eight times greater than the anabolic demand for this compound.

gnd <dig> upregulation has been observed in various situations in which the flux through the pp pathway increases  <cit> . this is not surprising, because this gene encodes a protein that catalyzes an irreversible reaction. by contrast, zwf <dig>  which encodes a protein that catalyzes the first irreversible nadph-producing reaction of this pathway, was not transcriptionally regulated. these findings may be accounted for by differences in the cost of the proteins encoded by these genes. indeed, a recent study in escherichia coli suggested that the production of enzymes with a high cost  is more tightly controlled than that of enzymes with a lower cost  <cit> . if the same is true in yeast, it would account for the transcriptional regulation of gnd <dig> rather than zwf <dig>  because the cost of gnd1p is  <dig> times that of zwf1p  <cit> .

we initially hypothesized that the transcription factor stb5p might be involved in the maintenance of redox homeostasis under anaerobic conditions. however, only eight of the  <dig> stb5p target genes  <cit>   displayed differential regulation , consistent with stb5p playing no role in the redirection of flux observed in response to increases in nadph oxidation. this low proportion of stb5p target genes responding to nadph/nadp+ imbalance suggests that stb5p does not sense nadph changes directly during oxidative stress.

the repression of genes involved in the synthesis of reserve carbohydrates under conditions of the greatest nadph demand might optimize nadph synthesis by rerouting carbons towards the pp pathway. the same may also be true for the repression of genes involved in glycolysis and alcoholic fermentation. however, as pyruvate decarboxylase is also used to generate acetoin from acetaldehyde, the downregulation of pdc <dig> and pdc <dig> may result from disturbance of the acetaldehyde node. by contrast, pdc <dig> was upregulated in response to altered nadh demand. whether this may have resulted from the accumulation of acetadehyde in this condition  remains to be explored.

indirect effects of changes in nadph demand on amino-acid synthesis
the other main changes in transcription concerned the synthesis of amino acids, particularly the nadph-consuming methionine and lysine pathways and serine synthesis, which is connected to the methionine pathway.

met genes expression is normally activated by the met4p transcription factor when the levels of these sulfur-containing compounds are low  <cit> . sulfate assimilation requires considerable amounts of nadph . our results therefore suggest that decreases in nadph availability limit the flux through this pathway, resulting in low levels of sulfur-containing compound production and a global derepression of the sulfate assimilation pathway. these findings are consistent with the coordinated regulation of this pathway, which is controlled principally through feedback repression exerted primarily by cysteine  <cit> . the relationship between the pp phosphate pathway and the sulfur pathway has long been known  <cit>  and is illustrated by the sensitivity to osmotic stress of a zwf <dig> mutant. the connection between these two pathways does not seem to be based on transcriptional control. indeed, no common regulator of the genes of these two pathways has been identified except met4p, the main activator of the sulfur pathway, which can also bind gnd <dig>  the minor isoform of the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase  <cit> .

the upregulation of the lys12lys <dig> and lys <dig> genes suggests that the same mechanism may operate when lysine production decreases. on the other hand, ser <dig> and ser <dig> encoding the first enzyme of the serine synthesis pathway, were also upregulated despite the description of this pathway as nadh-dependent  <cit> . however, as the biosynthetic reactions involving 3-phosphoglycerate, including those contributing to serine synthesis, constitute a highly branched network connecting the purine, thiamine, histidine and methionine biosynthesis pathways, the upregulation of these genes may be an indirect consequence of a decrease in the intracellular concentration of cysteine.

in addition, the repression of several genes linked to the sulfate assimilation pathway  may reflect a need for the cells to conserve methionine, as the synthesis of this compound is probably compromised by the higher demand of nadph.

effects of redox alteration on the synthesis of aroma compounds
we observed distinct effects of redox alteration on the production of fermentative aroma compounds, depending on the cofactor  and on the class of aroma compounds. indeed, increases in the oxidation of nadh and nadph decreased the production of ethyl esters but did not alter the production of acetate esters. changes in esters profile could reflect a decrease in the availability of acetyl-coa  <cit> , a precursor of these molecules, as suggested by the lower level of flux through acetyl-coa synthase . this suggests that the alcohol-o-acetyltransferase responsible for catalyzing this reaction may be less sensitive to acetyl-coa concentration than the esterases involved in ethyl ester synthesis.

on the other hand, although the synthesis of phenyl ethanol increased in response to altered nadph demand, consistent with increased flux through the pp pathway, the synthesis of other fusel alcohols  was specifically increased in response to nadh alterations. isobutanol is synthesized from valine, which is produced from α-acetolactate, a compound also involved in acetoin synthesis. we suggest that the synthesis of acetoin by the pdc route is favored in conditions of acetaldehyde accumulation , and that α-acetolactate is rerouted towards the production of valine, isobutanol and isobutyl acetate. a key mechanism underlying this remodeling of flux may be the increase in pdc <dig> gene expression observed in response to nadh oxidation . pdc <dig> encodes a protein involved in the decarboxylation step of the erhlich pathway. the greater production of butanol and propanol may therefore be explained by increased pdc <dig> expression.

the energy problem and the glycerol-dha cycle
analysis of the metabolic response to an nadph demand  <dig> times greater than anabolic demand revealed a metabolic shift that we attributed to saturation of the pp pathway  <cit> . this conclusion is consistent with the intracellular metabolite profiles obtained in this study. moreover, a previous constraint-based metabolic flux analysis suggested that a glycerol-dha cycle exchanging nadh for nadph was activated in these conditions  <cit> . the intracellular metabolite profile revealed energetic inconsistencies , consistent with the hypothetical operation of this cycle. indeed, the atp and utp pools were markedly smaller in the presence of 300 mm acetoin than in the presence of the other two concentrations of this compound. axp concentration is one of the major factors controlling the regulation of the glycolysis and carbohydrate pathways  <cit> . the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates may result from a decrease in phosphofructokinase activity due to a decrease in atp availability or from an increase in glycolytic flux. an increase in glycolytic flux was actually previously observed  <cit>  in the presence of 300 mm acetoin .

flux toward acetaldehyde, via pyruvate decarboxylase, increased, at the expense of the reactions supplying the tca pathway. the nadph imbalance results in the rerouting of the carbon atoms of acetaldehyde for the production of acetate via ald6p. the marked accumulation of acetate when the cells were incubated in the presence of 300 mm acetoin  probably resulted from a lower level of flux through acetyl-coa synthase, resulting from both atp limitation and a smaller acetyl-coa requirement for lipid biosynthesis. consistent with the limited production of acetyl-coa, the production of acetate esters and fatty acids from this precursor decreased in response to increases in nadph demand.

CONCLUSIONS
this study highlights the remarkable robustness of yeast to changes in nadph demand, based on efficient mechanisms for the reprogramming of metabolic flux to produce large amounts of nadph. in line with previous studies  <cit> , we observed that fluxes are controlled by both metabolic and transcriptional regulation. however, the contribution of these mechanisms varies in function of the nadph demand. metabolic control was involved in the adaptation to increases in nadph demand to up to eight times the anabolic demand. at higher levels of nadph demand, transcriptional regulation of several genes also contributes to the rerouting of carbons towards the pp pathway.
