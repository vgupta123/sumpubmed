BACKGROUND
non invasive monitoring of the kidney status using urine biomarkers can lead to the early diagnosis of renal dysfunction, which might help avoid or diminish the use of invasive methods like renal biopsy and improve patients treatment and survival particularly in renal or uro-genital pathologies such as renal cancers, diabetic nephropathy or allograft dysfunctions in renal transplantation.

several urine biomarker discovery studies in renal diseases have been published, most of which used surface enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry  which is characterized by its poor resolution but high throughput capacity  <cit> . recently, capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry  has been largely used in urinary peptidomic studies for biomarkers discovery, giving rise to many published results though sometimes without protein or peptide identification  <cit> . also, different candidate biomarkers have thus been proposed for the same pathology, none of which have been validated in a large population. such diversity may be due to the inter- and intra-individual variability in the urine proteome, and/or to differences in urine sampling, storage and analysis procedures across different studies  <cit> . some authors gave recommendations for the standardization of proteomic analysis procedures, particularly for the pre-analytical phase . preventive measures must be taken to avoid alterations of the urinary proteome and peptidome composition due to bacterial growth  <cit> , storage conditions, freeze-thaw cycles, ph conditions, etc  <cit> .

lc-maldi-tof/tof analysis is a new potential tool for biomarkers discovery because of its high sensitivity and high throughput capacity  <cit> . however, the use of maldi-tof/tof as an analytical tool in clinical research still needs optimization and evaluation  <cit> . one of the major limitations of the maldi-based technique is its relative poor reproducibility in measuring m/z abundances , which may be essential in biomarker discovery where all-or-nothing variations are probably not the most frequent  <cit> . in addition, lc-maldi-tof/tof analysis generally takes a long time, which is hardly practical when analysing large numbers of samples. however, this technique is recognized for its high mass precision .

the aims of the present study were:  to optimize and critically evaluate each step of a comprehensive urine biomarker discovery method based on nano-lc coupled off-line to maldi-tof/tof, taking full advantage of the dual decoupling between nano-lc, ms and ms/ms to reduce the overall analysis time and increase the technique throughput, as will be requested during the validation phase involving a larger population set;  to evaluate the quantitative performance and reproducibility of nano-lc-maldi analysis in biomarker discovery; and  to evaluate the robustness of biomarkers selection using pseudo-biomarker peptides.

methods
sample collection
urine samples from  <dig> healthy volunteers who had not recently received any medication were used. all subjects gave their written informed consent to participate in this study. a sample of  <dig> ml of mid-stream urine was collected in a polypropylene tube containing one complete™ mini tablet  to inactivate endogenous and exogenous proteases, and sodium azide at a final concentration of  <dig> mg/ml to prevent bacterial growth. cells or other insoluble materials  were cleared from the samples by centrifugation at low speed , then  <dig> ml urine sample aliquots were transferred in polypropylene tubes, lyophilized, and stored at -80°c until their usage.

urine sample processing
before nanolc-maldi ms analysis, each stored sample of lyophilized urine was reconstituted with  <dig> ml of  <dig> % trifluoro-acetic acid   in hplc grade water and submitted to solid phase extraction  on a c <dig> ethyl  <dig>  ml cartridge , following the standard procedure recommended by the vendor. urinary peptides were eluted with acetonitrile/water  solution containing  <dig> % formic acid. the eluate was finally evaporated using a speedvac® system  and then resuspended in  <dig> μl of  <dig> % tfa. peptides and proteins concentrations were measured using bradford reagent . then,  <dig> μl of the urine extract were mixed with  <dig> μl of the proteomix  <dig> peptides calibrator  consisting of: human angiotensin ii ; neurotensin ; acth 18– <dig> fragment ; and insulin β chain oxidized . peptide calibrators were used for subsequent time-shift alignment and intensity normalization of the nano-lc-maldi ms reconstituted chromatograms.

urinary peptides separation using nano-hplc
chromatographic separation of peptides was performed using an ultimate  <dig> nano-hplc system  equipped with: a thermostated column compartment, a six-port micro-switching valve, a dynamic nanoflow splitter with a flow meter, a micro vacuum degasser and a thermostated microwell-plate autosampler with a six-port micro-switching valve. one to five microlitres of reconstituted urine containing the same relative quantity of materials  were concentrated on a  trapping column packed with c <dig> pepmap  <dig>  using mobile phase a: acetonitrile/water  with  <dig> % tfa delivered at  <dig> μl/min. the trapping column was switched on-line with the analytical column after  <dig> min loading time. chromatographic separation of peptides was performed using a c <dig> pepmap  <dig> column  and using a linear gradient of b, a mixture of acetonitrile/water  with  <dig> % tfa, in solvent a, as follows: from 10% to 45% of b in  <dig> min, switched to 100% buffer b for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> min re-equilibration with buffer a at a constant flow rate of  <dig>  μl/min, stabilized by an active splitter . the column was directly coupled to a uv flow cell detector  at the exit of which the effluent was coaxially mixed with a solution of  <dig>  mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid maldi matrix   prepared daily and delivered at a flow rate of  <dig>  μl/min , then directed towards an on-line probot  plate-spotting system. each spot represented a 12-second "fraction"  of the reverse phase gradient. the triplicate runs of each sample, each containing  <dig> spots, were distributed on the same maldi plate.

maldi-tof/tof data acquisition
the spots representing the different chromatographic fractions were analyzed using a  <dig> maldi-tof/tof mass spectrometer , equipped with a neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser emitting at λ =  <dig> nm with a repetition rate of  <dig> hz. the mass spectrometer was controlled by the  <dig> series explorer, version  <dig> . <dig> program. for ms analyses, typically  <dig> spectra were acquired for each spot in the reflector positive mode in the mass range of  <dig> to  <dig> m/z, with  <dig> ppm mass tolerance . the spots of fractions eluted before  <dig> min and after  <dig> min were not analyzed for the sake of time, as preliminary investigations showed that they apparently contained very little peptide information.

data processing and analysis
peak lists obtained from nano-lc-maldi-tof chromatograms were processed using markerview version  <dig>  . alignment was first performed with 45% retention time and  <dig>  amu mass tolerances. these settings were optimized values found to give a maximum number of common peaks between sample replicates. then, data were scaled in intensity by normalization to the median intensity of one reference chromatogram  using markerview. after alignment and normalization, the data were filtered out from maldi residual α-chca matrix clusters. as most matrix clusters had masses below  <dig> m/z, filtration consisted in excluding all ions with m/z <  <dig> 

principal component analysis  was performed on processed data using different scaling options  proposed by markerview program. pareto scaling was finally retained because of its best grouping performance explaining the largest variability in three principal components vectors . pareto data pre-treatment consists of mean centring and scaling by square root of standard deviation of m/z intensities. the ions were classified according to the sum of their loading values in the first three principal components pc <dig>  pc <dig>  and pc <dig>  ions with the highest pc loading values were considered as the most discriminative ions.

maldi-tof/tof msms data acquisition
ms/ms data acquisition was only performed on maldi plate stored at -20°c, for peptide sequence and protein identification of these selected discriminative ions. the typical experiment workflow is summarized in figure  <dig>  ms/ms acquisitions were then carried out using air as collision gas at a pressure of ~ <dig>  × 10- <dig> torr and collision energy of  <dig> kv. approximately  <dig>  spectra were added up for each spot. the peaks were de-isotoped and only those with s/n ≥  <dig> were retained for interpretation.

protein identifications using ms and msms data
msms data were pre-processed by manufacturer computer program gps explorer version  <dig>   and then identification of urine proteins from their peptides sequences was established using mascot search engine version  <dig>   with the last updated version of swiss-prot protein database merged with random sequences. methionine oxidation and asn and gln deamidation were selected as the only variable modifications. the tolerance for precursor ion and ms/ms fragment mass values was set at  <dig> ppm and  <dig>  da, respectively. only the  <dig> top-ranked peptide matches were taken into consideration for protein identification.

method validation
extraction recovery
a pool of healthy volunteers' urine was divided in two aliquots which were spiked with the same amount of a mixture of four peptides , one aliquot before and the second after solid phase extraction  with the c2-ethyl cartridges. the samples were processed in triplicate to evaluate the reproducibility of sample processing and then analyzed in triplicate by nano-lc off-line maldi tof as described above.

influence of storage conditions on peptides spotted on maldi plates
the same mixture of four peptides was mixed with α-chca matrix solution at  <dig>  mg/ml , and  <dig> μl was spotted manually  <dig> times on each of three maldi plates. the plates were kept in the dark, one at room temperature, one at +4°c and the third at -20°c, for  <dig> months. once a week over this  <dig> month period,  <dig> different spots per plate were analyzed using maldi tof/tof in the reflector mode.

quantitative response and performance of data processing and analysis
quantitative accuracy and reproducibility of maldi-tof/tof as well as the aptitude of the data pre-processing the data processing and the data analysis procedures to select discriminative ions were evaluated by comparing two samples prepared from c2-extract of a healthy volunteer's urine aliquot, spiked or not with increasing concentrations of three peptides: human angiotensin ii , neurotensin  and acth 18– <dig> fragment . six replicates of each spiked and non-spiked aliquots were then analyzed by lc-maldi-tof/tof as described above, including retention time alignment and intensity normalization.

RESULTS
solid phase extraction and desalting on c2-ethyl cartridges resulted in losses of large urinary peptides and proteins. the synthetic peptides were recovered with yields of approximately 60%, 80% and 20% for human angiotensin ii , neurotensin peptide  and acth fragment , respectively, while the oxidized bovine insulin beta chain  was totally lost . some peptides with m/z >  <dig> da could nevertheless be detected in urine samples processed this way , meaning either that they were highly concentrated or that peptide loss is not only related to their size, but also to their structural properties. a good reproducibility of urine sample processing was obtained using the spe c <dig> ethyl procedure for peptide extraction in spiked urine, showing coefficient of variation  of 14%, 20%, and 10% for the human angiotensin ii , neurotensin peptide  and acth fragment , respectively. the non-hydrolyzed urinary peptidome was studied as a source of potential biomarkers instead of trypsinized urine proteins and peptides in order to reduce the complexity of analytes in urines, avoid protease contaminations and reveal potentially natural or pathologically induced protease activity in urine of patients following renal or uro-genital injury  <cit> . sample desalting and peptide extraction was done on c2-ethyl cartridges that retain peptides based on their polarity and size characteristics. moreover, this step removes most of intact proteins and consequently diminishes the large diluting effect caused by major serum proteins such as human serum albumin, possibly found in urine during physiological episodes of hypertension or other stresses/exercises, as well as in different renal diseases  <cit> . this sample preparation method was also chosen because of possible automation to increase the analytical throughput. the same resin was used extensively in formerly published studies describing urinary peptides as potential biomarkers  <cit> .

a relatively long chromatographic run of  <dig> min was chosen in order to obtain the best separation of peptides without too much loss of sensitivity, resulting in a decrease of the number of urinary peptides immobilized per spot/fraction to be analyzed during ms data acquisition, aligned and filtered urinary chromatograms contained  <dig> ions, the spiked peptides were eluted at  <dig>  min,  <dig>  min and  <dig>  min retention time for m/z  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  respectively . as only the fractions between  <dig> and  <dig> min were spotted, it resulted in approximately  <dig> spots per replicate, so that full informative triplicate nanolc chromatograms could be spotted on a single maldi plate. this approach decreased plate storage space, cost and minimized plate-to-plate signal variability.

targeted msms analysis  allows sequence peptides identification of spiked pseudo-biomarkers .

the maldi-tof/tof ms analysis of one plate typically took  <dig>  hours. while the unsupervised ms/ms analysis of an entire plate would have taken  <dig> hours, our actual targeted ms/ms analysis took  <dig> seconds per selected ion and per spot. complete ms analysis of a urine sample in triplicate  still took a long time but the decoupling between ms and msms resulted in a gain of time of approximately  <dig> fold.

the analysis of  <dig> replicates of urine aliquots spiked or not with  <dig> standard peptides at increasing concentrations showed that their m/z intensity was linearly correlated with their concentration  in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> fmol/μl . the precision of the measure evaluated as mean cv % between the six replicates was  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig> ± 2% and  <dig>  ± 7% for m/z  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  respectively. moreover, spiked and non-spiked urine aliquots were totally discriminated by pca, with pc scores of  <dig> %, 18% and  <dig> % for pc <dig>  pc <dig>  and pc <dig>  respectively. figure 5a shows the plot of sample scores for pc <dig> and pc <dig>  all six replicates of spiked urine are clustered, as well as  <dig> out of  <dig> of the non-spiked urine replicates. furthermore, the plot of the loading values for pc <dig> and pc <dig>  shows that the most discriminative ions with the highest positive loadings on pc <dig> and pc <dig> are the spiked peptides. the spiked peptides were the top ranked discriminative peptides according to their pc loadings at the highest concentration  but not at their lowest , although they were still among the top ten of the most discriminative ions. the loadings of spiked peptides according to their concentration are summarized in table  <dig>  in addition, pca classified correctly spiked and non-spiked urine aliquots at each spiked peptide concentration . good correlation was found between spiked peptide concentrations and m/z intensity, even though it is known that maldi ionization yields poor reproducibility of peak intensity, particularly due to poor inter-spot crystallization reproducibility  <cit> . quantification precision  was sufficient here to allow semi-quantitative estimation in the low fentomole range. the use of an internal peptide calibration using glu1-fibrinopeptide b diluted in the matrix for precision purposes and correction of matrix crystallization variability was investigated, but not pursued because of its important ion suppression effect on the other analytes, particularly at low concentrations . however, our ms data acquisition strategy consisted in recording ms spectra resulting from  <dig> laser shots , thus improving signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity, as well as quantification precision.

the rank of each standard peptide in the complete dataset is given according to the sum of their loading absolute values in the  <dig> retained pcs

CONCLUSIONS
this study showed the beneficial effect of a dual decoupling strategy between nano-lc maldi-tof and tof/tof mass spectrometry on overall analytical time. associated with pca, this method allowed successful discrimination of urine samples spiked or not with low fentomole/μl synthetic peptides used as pseudo-biomarkers. this method is currently being applied to the discovery phase of potential urine biomarkers of graft rejection in kidney transplant patients.
