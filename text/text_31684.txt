BACKGROUND
when breeding cereal crops, the choice of a larger grain can increase the yield of crop varieties when other yield-related traits remain relatively stable. among the three key components of rice yield , grain weight has high heritability  <cit> . rice grains display a comparatively geometric shape, which can be broken down into grain length , grain width  and grain thickness . these size/shape traits combined with grain density can explain the rice grain weight trait effectively.

through linkage and association mapping, many quantitative trait loci  for grain size/shape have been identified in different mutants or natural populations  <cit> . only a small portion of these loci have been cloned, including gs <dig> , gl <dig> /qgl <dig>  <cit>  and tgw <dig>  <cit>  for grain length, and gw <dig>  <cit> , gw5/qsw <dig>  <cit> , gs <dig>  <cit>  and gw <dig>  <cit>  for grain width. some grain size/shape qtls, such as gw <dig>   <cit> , gw <dig>  <cit> , qgl <dig>  <cit> , qgl7- <dig>  <cit> , gs <dig>  <cit>  and qss <dig>  <cit> , were also mapped to a narrow chromosome region. additionally, several small  seed phenotype causal genes were identified by map-based cloning, including d <dig> , bu <dig>  <cit> , srs <dig>  <cit> , srs <dig>  <cit> , srs <dig>  <cit> , and sg <dig>  <cit> .

there are few reports about the genetic interaction of these characterized genes  <cit> . yan et al.  found genetic interactions between gs <dig> and qsw <dig>  the effect of qsw <dig> on seed length was masked by gs <dig> alleles, and the effect of gs <dig> on seed width was masked by qsw <dig> alleles. no significant qtl interaction was observed between the two major grain width genes, gw <dig> and qsw5/gw <dig>  suggesting that they might work to regulate grain width in independent pathways  <cit> . gs <dig> was effective in the presence of the gs <dig> non-functional a-allele and ineffective when combined with the functional gs <dig> c-allele  <cit> . however, how these genes work together or interact with others has not been deeply explored. the genetic interaction between two major grain length qtls, gs <dig> and qgl <dig>  also remains unclear. at least four different alleles for gs <dig> were identified by mao et al. : gs3- <dig> , gs3- <dig> , gs3-3/gs <dig>  and gs3- <dig> . gs3- <dig> and gs3- <dig> are functional short grain alleles, and gs3- <dig> is a stronger functional extra-short grain forming allele. gs3- <dig> has a premature termination, resulting in a non-functional long grain allele. at the cellular level, gs <dig> controls grain size largely by modulating the longitudinal cell number in grain glumes. its organ size regulation domain in the n-terminus is necessary and sufficient for it to function as a negative regulator and act as a dominant allele  <cit> . one of its homologs in the rice genome, dense and erect panicle <dig>  also functions as a negative regulator of rice grain length  <cit> . recently, its homolog in arabidopsis, agg <dig>  was shown to be an atypical heterotrimeric gtp-binding protein  γ-subunit that positively regulated organ size  <cit> . another major grain-length locus, gl <dig> /qgl <dig>  was map-based cloned and characterized by two independent groups  <cit> . gl <dig> /qgl <dig> encodes a putative protein phosphatase  containing two kelch domains. transgenic studies showed that the kelch domains functioned as a negative regulator and were essential for the biological function of osppkl <dig>  at the cellular level, qgl <dig> functions by negatively modulating the longitudinal cell number in grain glumes.

in this study, we focused on the genetic interaction between two major grain length qtls, gs <dig> and qgl <dig>  the functional and non-functional alleles of gs <dig> and qgl <dig> were individually or simultaneously placed in the genetic background of 93– <dig>  to evaluate their genetic interaction. to understand these interactions at the molecular level, we analyzed the transcriptomes of young panicles  of the nils combining different alleles of gs <dig> and qgl <dig> through microarray assays. our work could be helpful to better understand the genetic and molecular mechanisms of grain length regulation and molecular design rice breeding.

RESULTS
the additive effects of gs <dig> and qgl <dig> on grain length
functional gs <dig> and non-functional qgl <dig> were introduced into the 93– <dig> genetic background  to generate nil-gs <dig>  and nil-qgl <dig> , respectively. by crossing nil-gs <dig> with nil-qgl <dig>  and marker-assisted selection , we created a third line, nil-gs3/qgl <dig> . the grain lengths of these three nils and their recurrent parent 93– <dig> with different allele combinations of gs <dig> and qgl <dig> were analyzed . we applied a two-way analysis of variance  for grain length  and genotype , and observed significant additive effects on grain length for gs3 × qgl <dig> , qgl <dig> , and gs <dig>  . considering nil-gs <dig>  as the control background, the loss of gs <dig> increased the grain length from  <dig>  mm  to  <dig>  mm , the loss of qgl <dig> increased the grain length from  <dig>  mm  to  <dig>  mm , and the loss of both increased the grain length from  <dig>  mm  to  <dig>  mm . loss of qgl <dig> increased grain length more in the functional gs <dig> background  than in the non-functional gs <dig> background . similarly, loss of gs <dig> increased grain length more in the functional qgl <dig> background  than in the non-functional qgl <dig> background  . according to these data, we concluded that gs <dig> and qgl <dig> had additive effects larger than genetic interaction on rice grain length regulation and that the effects of qgl <dig> were stronger .fig.  <dig> grains and plants of the nils and comparison of their expression profiles. a grains of the three nils and their genetic background, 93– <dig>  scale bar,  <dig>  mm. b plants of three nils and their genetic background, 93– <dig>  scale bar,  <dig>  cm. c venn diagram of the genes from different comparisons; red numbers indicate up-regulation, black indicates down-regulation. d expression profiles of the genes commonly regulated by the comparisons gs3/qgl <dig> vs. gs3/qgl <dig>  gs3/qgl <dig> vs. gs3/qgl <dig> and gs3/qgl <dig> vs. gs3/qgl3

among the seven genes up-regulated  by both gs <dig> and qgl <dig> , we found some encoded receptor protein kinases that might operate in the same signaling pathways to increase grain length in rice and explain the additive effects of gs <dig> and qgl <dig>  another commonly up-regulated gene, os11g <dig>  was found to encode a kinesin- <dig>  whose homolog, srs <dig> , was reported to positively regulate rice grain length  <cit> . among the genes commonly down-regulated by gs <dig> and qgl <dig> , we found that gs <dig> and qgl <dig> down-regulated a gene  encoding a ribonuclease t <dig> family domain-containing protein by 46- and 34-fold, respectively.

profiling of gene up- and down-regulation and gene ontology analysis of degs in different genotypes
to reveal the genes affected by gs <dig> and qgl <dig>  we compared the transcriptomes of the primary panicles of 93– <dig>  and its three nils through microarray analysis. compared with the nil-gs <dig>  background,  <dig> genes were up-regulated by >  <dig> -fold and  <dig> genes were down-regulated by <  <dig> -fold in 93– <dig>  . comparing the transcriptomes of nil-gs3/qgl <dig>  with those of nil-qgl <dig>  and nil-gs <dig>  as well as 93– <dig> , we found that  <dig> genes were up-regulated  and  <dig> genes were down-regulated . among the  <dig> commonly up-regulated genes, one gene  showed  <dig> -fold induction under the nil-gs <dig>  background and  <dig> -fold induction under the nil-qgl <dig>  background. it encoded a putative serine carboxypeptidase of the peptidase s <dig> family . furthermore, we analyzed the genes commonly up- and down-regulated by qgl <dig> in both the nil-qgl <dig>  and nil-gs <dig>  backgrounds and found  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes . by comparing the transcriptomes of the panicles of nil-qgl <dig>  and nil-gs <dig> , we found that  <dig> genes were up-regulated by >  <dig> -fold and  <dig> were down-regulated by <  <dig> -fold . among these, we found a down-regulated gene, os03g <dig>  encoding a ga <dig> oxidase involved in the ga pathway. we also discovered that some genes involved in br signaling were differentially expressed, such as a glycogen synthase kinase  family gene  . the number of down-regulated genes was higher than the number of up-regulated genes for 93– <dig> and its three nils.

to determine the identities of the differentially expressed genes , we categorized them based on their known functions using gene ontology  classifications. the degs between combination i , combination ii  and combination iii  were used to analyze the go pathways. these genes were associated with diverse biological, molecular and cellular functions, as shown in tables  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  this functional grouping primarily serves to facilitate data visualization. the functional classifications of the degs regulated by gs <dig> were mainly associated with metabolic processes, catalytic activity, and binding . the gene os03g <dig>  which is also called osscp <dig>  was associated with the go: <dig> and go: <dig> classifications. its homolog in arabidopsis thaliana is brs <dig>  which might participate in the br signaling pathway. interestingly, we also found this gene in combination iii. the degs regulated by qgl <dig> were mainly associated with metabolic processes, cell parts, catalytic activity, and binding . according to q-pcr verification, the gene os02g <dig> encoding a calcium-dependent protein kinase was tremendously up-regulated in nil-qgl <dig> , nil-gs3/qgl <dig>  and 93– <dig> compared with nil-gs <dig> . ca2+ sensor protein kinases are prevalent in most plant species including rice. oscpk <dig>  which also encodes a calcium-dependent protein kinase, played a significant role in the grain filling process and eventually reduced the crop duration in overexpression plants  <cit> . the degs regulated by both gs <dig> and qgl <dig> were associated with  <dig> go terms, which included the go terms of gs <dig> and qgl <dig> . of these go terms in table  <dig>  many transcripts encoded proteins involved in cellular metabolic process such as nb-arc domain containing protein, f-box domain containing protein, zinc ion binding proteins and calcium-dependent protein kinase isoform ak <dig>  in addition to genes associated with cellular metabolic process, genes associated with leucine-rich-repeat  family protein and the calcium/calmodulin depedent protein kinases were annotated with the go term “signal transduction”. os03g <dig> and os02g <dig> were also among the degs regulated by gs <dig> and qgl <dig>  in addition, os07g <dig> encoding f-box domain and kelch repeat containing protein, overlapping expression of rice f-box protein encoding genes during floral transition as well as panicle and seed development  <cit> . these results indicated that gs <dig> and qgl <dig> might participate in the same or parallel signaling pathways to regulate grain length.table  <dig>

metabolic pathways, cellular response and cell regulation analysis for degs
to identify genes related to metabolic reconfiguration in the different combinations, the mapman tool was used to select and display the significantly regulated metabolic pathways. from our results, the up- and down-regulated genes were classified into  <dig> bins.

by mapman analysis of the degs regulated by gs <dig>  we found that most of the genes associated with the cell wall, lipids, light reactions and secondary metabolism showed down-regulation . some genes related to the cell wall were down-regulated by gs <dig>  implying that down-regulation of these cell wall-related genes may negatively regulate cell wall formation. in our regulation overview, protein degradation and receptor kinases were the most frequent categories . in the hormone metabolism bin, it was found that os03g <dig> was related with ethylene synsesis. using the cell regulation and cell response overview function of mapman, we found that genes related to protein degradation, biotic/abiotic stress, enzyme families, and transport were highly induced . in the protein degradation bin, four up-regulated genes  and one down-regulated gene  were involved in it. os03g <dig> was in the protein degradation bin and might participate in the br signaling pathway. os03g <dig> encoding a von willebrand factor type a  domain containing protein might regulate rice vegetative growth and development. however, in the cellular response overview we only found one gene  related with biotic stress . degs associated with the cell wall, lipids, light reactions and secondary metabolism showed up-regulation, while some genes associated with the cell wall, lipids, and ascorbate and glutathione metabolism were down-regulated by qgl <dig> . in the cellular response and cell regulation overview, genes related to hormones , biotic/abiotic stress, rna regulation of transcription, protein degradation, receptor kinase signaling, the cell cycle and protein modification were the most abundant . we further investigated three genes that were in the cell cycle bin, os02g <dig>  os02g <dig> and os04g <dig>  all of which were up-regulated by qgl <dig>  os02g <dig> encoded a kind of cyclin related to grain size regulation  <cit> . os04g <dig> encoded a kind of peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, which was up-regulated  <dig> -fold by qgl <dig> under the nil-gs3/qgl <dig> background . this indicated that qgl <dig> might regulate grain length through regulation of the cell cycle. the regulation overview function of mapman showed that degs associated with transcription factors, protein modification, and protein degradation were significantly regulated by qgl <dig> . in the transcription factor bin, it was found that some transcription factors, os01g <dig> encoding c2h <dig> zinc finger family protein, os04g <dig> encoding myb related transcription and os03g <dig> encoding a ccaat-box binding protein. the mapman analysis indicated that some metabolic pathways were changed by allelic alterations at both loci, gs <dig> and qgl <dig> . we found that genes associated with photorespiration, light reactions, lipids, the cell wall and secondary metabolism were up-regulated, while genes related to lipids, the tca cycle, and ascorbate and aldarate metabolisms were down-regulated . with cellular response overview, degs associated with biotic/abiotic stress and development were significantly regulated by both gs <dig> and qgl <dig> . degs in bins such as transcription factors, protein modification, protein degradation, receptor kinases and hormones  were up-regulated by gs <dig> and qgl <dig> . in the ga synthesis overview, we found that a gene  related with ga <dig> oxidase was down-regulated by both gs <dig> and qgl <dig>  it is possible that br and ga interact closely to regulate cell elongation  <cit> . we found that some degs encoded regulators, including two transcription factors, a b <dig> dna binding domain-containing protein  and three myb family transcription factor . these regulators might take part in the same signaling pathways to increase grain length in rice, which would explain the additive effects of gs <dig> and qgl <dig> . overall, through mapman analysis, we found that gs <dig> and qgl <dig> were involved in some common or parallel metabolic pathways to regulate grain length.fig.  <dig> overview of the differentially expressed genes between gs3/qgl <dig> vs. gs3/qgl <dig> and gs3/qgl <dig> vs. gs3/qgl <dig>  a metabolism overview in mapman. b cellular response overview in mapman. c cell regulation overview in mapman. d regulation overview in mapman. red, up-regulation; white, no change; blue, down-regulation

quantitative real-time pcr validation of degs
to confirm the accuracy and reproducibility of the microarray results, eight genes commonly up-regulated and six genes commonly down-regulated by gs <dig> and qgl <dig> were selected for real-time pcr verification, including five br signaling or grain length regulation associated genes, os11g <dig>  os07g <dig>  os02g <dig>  os01g <dig> and os01g <dig>  the q-pcr results for these genes were accordance with the microarray data . the eight up-regulated genes and six down-regulated genes all showed up- and down-regulation in 93– <dig> , nil-gs3/qgl <dig>  and nil-qgl <dig>  compared with the nil-gs <dig>  background . strikingly, one gene, os02g <dig>  encoding a calcium-dependent protein kinase, was obviously up-regulated in nil-qgl <dig> , nil-gs3/qgl <dig>  and 93– <dig> compared with nil-gs <dig>  .fig.  <dig> q-pcr validation of differentially expressed genes in the four rice lines. a eight commonly up-regulated genes. b six commonly down-regulated genes



discussion
grain size is a target in breeding and natural selection, and both gs <dig> and qgl <dig> significantly regulate grain size and organ size. in this study, we compared the grain lengths of four nils, using nil-gs <dig> as a control group. the results indicated that gs <dig> and qgl <dig> had additive effects on rice grain length regulation. moreover, qgl <dig> had a stronger effect on rice grain length regulation than gs <dig>  on grain length, the strength of the additive signal from gs <dig> and qgl <dig> was much larger than the genetic interaction signal. however, there were large genetic interactions between gs <dig> and qgl <dig> on the expression levels of commonly regulated genes rather than additive effects. this work represents the first analysis of the genetic interaction between qgl <dig> and gs <dig>  we used gene ontology  <cit>  and mapman  <cit>  bioinformatics-based approaches for analyses aimed to interpret the biological significance of gene expression data. through go and mapman analysis, we found that some genes regulated by gs <dig> and qgl <dig> are involved in br signaling, the cell cycle, protein degradation, the ga/iaa family and protein modification, and might play important roles in the regulation of grain length. the gs <dig> up-regulated gene, os03g <dig>  was in the protein degradation bin, and its homolog  in arabidopsis was reported to regulate br signaling  <cit> . os05g <dig> in the protein modification bin was down-regulated by both gs <dig> and qgl <dig>  and its homolog bin <dig> in arabidopsis is a negative regulator of br signaling  <cit> . based on the functional annotations of the commonly regulated genes identified in this research, the regulation of grain length by qgl <dig> and gs <dig> might involve the br signaling pathway.

brs are a group of steroid phytohormones ubiquitously distributed throughout the plant kingdom  <cit> . they have essential roles in a wide range of plant growth and development processes, and can promote cell division or elongation and enhance tolerance to environmental stresses and resistance to pathogens  <cit> . the signal transduction pathway of brs has been extensively studied  <cit> . the phosphorylation of bsk <dig>  by the br receptor kinase br-insensitive  <dig>  promotes bsk <dig> binding to the bri <dig> suppressor  <dig>  phosphatase. bsu <dig>  in turn, inactivates the gsk3-like kinase br-insensitive  <dig>  by dephosphorylating a conserved phospho-tyrosine residue   <cit> . qgl <dig>  encodes a protein phosphatase  <cit>  and its two homologs in arabidopsis, bsu <dig> and bsl <dig>  were reported to promote brassinosteroid signaling  <cit> . they transmit a signal by dephosphorylating and deactivating the bin <dig> kinase downstream of br signaling  <cit> . moreover, we found that genes involved in br signaling, such as the cgmc_gsk family genes, encoding arabidopsis bin <dig> homologous proteins, were differentially expressed between nil-gs <dig>  and nil-gs3/qgl <dig> . recently, we cloned the gsk family genes and obtained additional evidence for the interaction of osppkl <dig> and gsks via yeast two-hybrid assays . these data indicated that qgl <dig> might participate in br signaling by dephosphorylating gsks. however, qgl <dig> is a negative regulator of rice grain length  <cit> , suggesting that osppkl1-gsk interaction might play different roles in br signaling in rice compared with bsu1- and bsl1-bin <dig> interaction in arabidopsis.

gs <dig> is a major qtl for grain length and weight and a minor qtl for grain width and thickness  <cit> . gs <dig> was reported to be an atypical heterotrimeric g protein γ-subunit that positively regulates organ size  <cit> . the heterotrimeric g protein α-subunit, known as d1/rga <dig> in rice, is involved in an alternative br-signaling pathway, independent of osbri <dig>  recently, hu et al.  reported that a u-box e <dig> ubiquitin ligase worked as a linkage factor between the heterotrimeric gα subunit and br signaling to mediate rice growth, mainly by regulating cell proliferation and organizing cell files in aerial organs. in this study, we found that gs <dig> up-regulated a putative serine carboxypeptidase of the peptidase s <dig> family. its homolog in arabidopsis  was reported to positively regulate br signaling  <cit> . we believe that this gene might have gs5-like properties. overexpression of brs <dig> suppressed the cell surface receptor for brs in bri <dig> extracellular domain mutants  <cit> . one of its homologs in rice was cloned as the grain-size gene gs <dig>  which increased grain width when its expression increased  <cit> . these data reveal that some members of the serine carboxypeptidase family might act downstream of br signaling as positive factors. our research implies that gs <dig> also takes some part in br signaling, and both gs <dig> and qgl <dig> might share a common br signaling associated pathway in the regulation of rice grain length. we suppose that qgl <dig> might directly participate in brassinolide signaling by dephosphorylating gsks, while gs <dig> indirectly influences brs <dig>  which is parallel to the bri-mediated br signaling pathway.

among the genes up-regulated by both loci, we found a gene encoding a kinesin- <dig>  whose homolog srs <dig> was reported to positively regulate rice grain length in seed formation  <cit> . we identified a small and round seed mutant phenotype . the gene, which belongs to the kinesin  <dig> subfamily, was designated srs <dig>  <cit> . the shortened seed phenotype of the srs <dig> mutant was probably the result of a reduction in cell length in the longitudinal direction  <cit> . the srs <dig> protein might be a homolog of the atkinesin 13a protein, which regulates trichome elongation in arabidopsis  <cit> . interestingly, among the genes commonly down-regulated by gs <dig> and qgl <dig>  we observed that a number of disease resistance related genes, encoding two nb-arc domain containing proteins, a stripe rust resistance protein yr <dig> and a peroxidase precursor, were down-regulated by both qgl <dig> and gs <dig>  suggesting that disease resistance responses may also be negatively correlated with grain development. in addition, we found a gene  encoding a ribonuclease t <dig> family domain containing protein involved in the cytokinin signaling pathway. a major qtl, grain number 1a , encodes a cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase  that catalyzes the irreversible degradation of cytokinin. mutation in gn1a/osckx <dig>  <cit> , which encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that directly and positively regulates gn1a/osckx <dig>  <cit> , caused the accumulation of cytokinin and consequently increased grain number  <cit> . in many cases, increased grain number is closely associated with reduced grain size, likely owing to the availability of fixed carbon in the source and the efficiency of transport to the sink  <cit> .

the currently available evidence suggests that the mechanisms underlying the additive effects of gs <dig> and qgl <dig> in regulating grain length might involve phytohormones  and key genes related to cell division or elongation. this research should help us to understand the mechanisms of the additive effects of gs <dig> and qgl <dig>  which would be useful for deciphering the genetic network involved in rice seed formation and for molecular breeding.

CONCLUSIONS
with an elite indica cultivar 93– <dig> as recurrent parent nil-gs <dig>  and nil-qgl <dig>  were developed by conventional backcrossing and marker-assisted selection. another line, nil-gs3/qgl <dig>  was developed by crossing nil-gs <dig> and nil-qgl <dig>  by comparing the grain length of 93– <dig> and its three nils we concluded that gs <dig> and qgl <dig> had additive effects on rice grain length regulation and that the effects of qgl <dig> were stronger. to reveal the genes affected by gs <dig> and qgl <dig>  we compared the transcriptomes of the primary panicles of 93– <dig> and the three nils through microarray analysis. the transcriptome analysis revealed that the genes affected by gs <dig> and qgl <dig> partially overlapped, and both loci might be involved in br signaling.
