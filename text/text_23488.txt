BACKGROUND
genome sequence comparison within a species can reveal genome evolution processes in detail and provide insights for basic and applied research. for bacteria, this approach has been quite powerful in revealing horizontal gene transfer, gene decay, and genome rearrangements underlying adaptation, such as evolution of virulence  <cit> . comparison of many complete genome sequences is feasible through innovations in dna sequencing.

helicobacter pylori was the first species for which two complete genome sequences were available  <cit> . this species of Îµ-proteobacteria causes gastritis, gastric  ulcer, and duodenal ulcer, and is associated with gastric cancer and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue  lymphoma  <cit> . animal models show a causal link between h. pylori and gastric cancer  <cit> . recent clinical work in japan suggests that h. pylori eradication reduces the risk of new gastric carcinomas in patients with a history of the disease  <cit> .

h. pylori shows a high mutation rate and an even higher rate of homologous recombination  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis based on several genes revealed geographical differentiation since h. pylori left africa together with homo sapiens  <cit> . the analysis indicated that the east asian type  is classified into at least three subtypes: east asian , pacific  and native american   <cit> . the east asia subtype  may be related to the high incidence of gastric cancer in east asia  <cit> .

h. pylori caga is considered to be a major virulence factor associated with gastric cancer. caga is delivered into gastric epithelial cells and undergoes phosphorylation by host kinases. membrane-localized caga mimics mammalian scaffold proteins, perturbs signaling pathways and promotes transformation. caga is noted for structural diversity in its c-terminal region, which interacts with host cell proteins. it is classified into western and east asian types, with higher activities associated with the latter  <cit> . the east asian caga-positive h. pylori infection is more closely associated with gastric cancer  <cit> . geographical differences have also been noted for other genes  <cit> .

to fully characterize these bacteria  and to study underlying intraspecific  evolutionary processes in detail at the genome sequence level, we determined the genome sequence of four japanese strains and compared them to available complete h. pylori genome sequences. the sequences of the japanese strains and two korean strains were different in gene content from the european and west african genomes and from the amerind genome. unexpectedly, divergence was seen in genes related to electron transfer and translation fidelity, as well as virulence and host interaction.

RESULTS
the complete genome sequences of four h. pylori strains  isolated from different individuals in fukui, japan were determined. we compared  <dig> complete genomes of h. pylori , focusing on their gene contents.

a) the first number is the length of the chromosome and the second number  is that of the plasmid.

b) accession numbers are as follows: f <dig> , f <dig> , f <dig> , f <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , shi <dig> , v225d , cuz <dig> , sat <dig> , pecan <dig> ,  <dig> , hpag <dig> , g <dig> , p <dig> , b <dig> , b <dig> , sjm <dig> , j <dig> ,  <dig> . draft sequence of the east asian strain 98- <dig>  <cit> . 98- <dig>   - .

c) letters in parentheses are the hybrid epiya segment. for example,  is a hybrid of epiya-a and epiya-b segments  <cit> .

d) reference  <cit> .

e) designated as home as it was very different from homa or homb.

f) "s" region locates outside of the orf.

g) a second caga gene between cagm and cagp.

h) , truncation.

i) mongolian gerbil-adapted, originally from gastric ulcer.

j) vaca gene is split.

k) according to a reference  <cit> , the sequence might not represent a complete genome, although it is deposited as a complete circular genome in genbank.

l) "m" region was not available because of a deletion in the center of the orf.

japanese/korean core genomes diverged from the european and then the amerind
a phylogenetic tree was constructed from concatenated seven genes atpa, efp, muty, ppa, trpc, urei and yphc, which were used for multi-locus sequence typing   <cit>  and phylogenetic analyses  <cit> ) ). the tree showed that the  <dig> east asian strains, the  <dig> japanese strains  and the  <dig> korean strains , are close to the known subpopulation hspeasia of hpeastasia, whereas  <dig> strains  are close to another subpopulation of hpeastasia, hspamerind. strains  <dig>  hpag <dig>  g <dig>  p <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and sjm <dig> were assigned to hpeurope. strains j <dig> and  <dig> were assigned to hspwafrica of hpafrica <dig>  pecan <dig> was tentatively assigned to hspamerind although it appears to be separate from the above  <dig> hspamerind strains and somewhat closer to other subgroups .

we deduced the common core genome structure of these  <dig> genomes based on the conservation of gene order using corealigner  <cit>  . corealigner determines the set of core genes among the related genomes not by universal conservation of genes but by conservation of neighborhood relationships between orthologous gene pairs allowing some exceptions. as a result, corealigner identified different numbers of core genes among strains , which reflect deletion, duplication and split of the core genes in the individual strains.

for phylogenetic analysis among the strains, we further extracted  <dig> well-defined core orthologous groups  as those that were universally conserved, non-domain-separated, and with one-to-one correspondence . the concatenated sequence of all well-defined core ogs resulted in a well-resolved phylogenetic tree . the tree was composed of two clusters, one containing the japanese, korean and amerind strains and the other containing the european and west african strains. the tree strongly supported a model in which the japanese/korean strains  and the amerind strains  diverged from their common ancestor, which in turn diverged from the ancestor shared by the european strains  long before. this conclusion is robust, as shown by the high bootstrap values of the internal nodes, primarily because the tree is composed of a large quantity of sequence information with approximately  <dig> genes. the japanese and korean strains were not separated into two clusters. pecan <dig> appeared diverged from the other four hspamerind strains as expected from the result of the phylogenetic analysis based on the  <dig> genes described above. sjm <dig> appeared diverged from the other hpeurope strains in the well-defined core gene-based tree.

phylogenetic profiling to identify gene contents of hspeasia
to thoroughly characterize the gene contents specific to the japanese/korean  strains, we conducted phylogenetic profile analysis using the domclust program  <cit> . this analysis determines the presence or absence of a domain, rather than a gene, and allows detection of split genes, partially deleted genes and partially duplicated genes . their features will be explained in the next five sections.

differences in outer membrane proteins and related proteins in the number of loci of gene families and in alleles at each locus
one of the emerging features of the east asian  strains is the change in the number of loci of some of the outer membrane protein  families. we detected five omp genes  with the number of loci different between the hspeasia and hpeurope strains . in all but one gene family, the difference in the number of locus was the result of gene decay in the east asian  strains.

+, present; x, disrupted ; -, absent. see additional file  <dig>  for a detailed list.

a) baba locus corresponds to hp0896; babb locus, hp1243; babc locus, hp <dig> 

b) saba locus corresponds to jhp0662; sabb locus, jhp <dig> 

c) paralog of vaca , but not vaca itself . another paralog vaca- <dig>  is in table  <dig> 

d) hp <dig> 

e)/, different loci.

f) one of  <dig> molybdenum-related genes was truncated.

g) hopq gene. two hopq copies exist, one at sabb locus and the other, as in other strains, at the hopq locus.

h) from the description of the reference  <cit> , the sequence might not represent a complete genome, although it is deposited as a complete circular genome in genbank. hence, care should be taken in interpreting the results.

relevant information about each family from draft sequence of the japanese strain 98- <dig>   <cit>  are as follows: oipa/oipa- <dig>  with at least one copy, although the exact copy number cannot be determined because of a short contig encoded only the oipa gene but not the flanking region; hopm locus, +? ; hopn locus, not applicable because it was at an end of contigs ; baba/babb/babc, a?/?/? ; saba/sabb, +/-; vaca- <dig>  x; nucg split as in the other hspeasia strains; molybdenum-related function, x.

the notable exception was oipa, for which a secondary locus was found in hspeasia  and hspamerind , but not in hpeurope  or hspwafrica . this increase of the secondary locus can be explained by a novel dna duplication mechanism associated with inversion  <cit> . the two hopmn loci in hpeurope  and hspwafrica  were reduced to one locus in the hspeasia  and hspamerind . this loss was likely caused by the same duplication mechanism  <cit> .

for the bababc family, the babc locus  <cit>  was empty in all the hpeastasia strains  as well as from all the hspwafrica strains  and two hpeurope strains . this is in contrast to the presence of three loci in the other  european strains .

the strain j <dig> carried a saba gene  at the saba locus and a sabb gene  at the sabb locus  <cit> . all the hpeurope strains but the strain b <dig>  and this hspwafrica strain  had these two loci, whereas all the hpeastasia strains but the strains  <dig> and pecan <dig>  lacked sabb locus . these hpeastasia strains all carried a saba gene at the saba locus. genes of hpeurope differed among strains. three strains  carried a saba gene at the saba locus and a sabb gene at the sabb locus, as j <dig>  the strain  <dig> carried a saba gene at both the saba and sabb loci, whereas the strain p <dig> carried a sabb gene at both the loci. the strain b <dig> carried a saba gene at the saba locus and a hopq gene at the sabb locus, along with another hopq gene at the hopq locus.

some of these genes  and homab genes were previously reported to diverge between the east asian and western strains  <cit> . difference in the number of copies of homab genes between east asian and western strains was reported  <cit> .

for hopmn, two gene types  have been recognized  <cit> . phylogenetic network analysis revealed two variable regions within the hopmn family . combining the two types of two variable regions defined four main gene types, of which two corresponded to hopm and hopn. the two types in region ii were designated m <dig> and m <dig> . the types in region iv were designated c <dig> and c <dig> ; c <dig> was another variant type in region iv, composed of parts of c <dig> and c <dig>  in this designation, previous hopm and hopn genes correspond to hopmnm1-c <dig> and hopmnm2-c <dig>  respectively. all hpeastasia strains except the strains  <dig> and pecan <dig>  carry sequence type c <dig> at region iv. the c <dig> variant is observed in j <dig>  pecan <dig> and sjm <dig> .

three vaca paralogs and vaca itself were found in  <dig>  <cit> . those paralogs share the auto-transporter domain at the c-terminus with vaca  <cit> . a large deletion in vaca- <dig>   was found in all the hspeasia strains except the strain  <dig>  ).

it was described earlier that hora omp locus in  <dig> is composed of two open reading frames   whereas that in j <dig> is composed of one orf   <cit> . the hora locus in all the hspeasia strains shows apparent gene decay by fragmentation through various mutations . whether the genes in the other strains are functional is not known.

a putative periplasmic endonuclease gene  was split in all the hspeasia strains examined ). detailed analysis revealed that the split was mediated by recombination between short similar sequences  <cit> .

massive decay of molybdenum-related genes for two-electron reduction-oxidation reactions
unexpectedly, our profiling suggested that functions related to molybdenum  were lost specifically in the hspeasia strains ). the trace element mo is essential for nearly all organisms  <cit> . after transport into the cell as molybdate, it is incorporated into metal cofactors for specific enzymes  that catalyze reduction-oxidation  reactions mediated by two-electron transfer.

+, present; x, disrupted .

a) strains shi <dig>  v225d, cuz <dig>  sat <dig> and pecan <dig> 

b) strains  <dig>  hpag <dig>  g <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and sjm <dig>

the states in strain 98- <dig> are: x for moda, modb, moba, moaa, moeb and bisc; + for modc, moad, moae, moga, moac and moea.

in the  <dig> h. pylori genomes, the only gene for molybdo-enzymes identified was bisc. at least one gene in each of the three mo-related functions, mo transport, mo cofactor synthesis and a mo-containing enzyme, decayed in all hspeasia strains . detailed analysis of nucleotide sequences revealed a mutation in  <dig> of  <dig> mo-related genes in some of the hspeasia strains ). the occurrence of apparently independent multiple mutations ) suggests some selection against use of mo in the hspeasia strains. all other strains but p <dig> possessed all intact genes. the strain p <dig> had a truncation of moad ). tungsten sometimes substitutes for mo, but genes for known tungstate/molybdate binding proteins  were not found in the h. pylori genomes.

the sequences in the four japanese strains were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction  with the primers listed in the additional file  <dig> .

the mo-related genes were in a list of "chronic gastritis-associated" genes  <cit> , primarily because they are absent from three amerind strains from the athabaskan people  <cit> . the  <dig> amerind strains analyzed in the present study are different from the three amerind strains in this respect. this difference could reflect the later migration of the athabaskans to the americas  <cit> .

two pathways between acetyl~coa and acetate in some japanese strains
our profiling revealed an important change at the center of energy and carbon metabolism related to acetyl~coa. two pathways connect acetyl~coa and acetate . in anaerobic fermentation, acetyl~coa is converted into acetate by phosphoacetyl transferase  and acetyl kinase  with generation of atp   <cit> . the intermediate acetyl~p, a high-energy form of phosphate, likely serves as a global signal. although these reactions are reversible, assimilation of acetate may be irreversibly mediated by acetyl~coa synthetase  by the generation of acetyl~coa, which enters the tca cycle to generate energy under aerobic conditions .

it has been suggested that strain  <dig>  carries a mutation in pta for the former pathway whereas strain j <dig>  lacks acoe for the latter  <cit> . all european strains in this study  had at least one inactivated pta and acka gene through a variety of mutations . two of five amerind strains, pecan <dig> and cuz <dig>  also had a mutated pta and acka, whereas the other 3/ <dig> amerind, 2/ <dig> african, and 3/ <dig> hspeasia strains had a pta and acka intact but had a deletion of acoe. exceptions to such apparent incompatibility between the two pathways were found for 3/ <dig> of the japanese strains , which had intact genes for both pathways . the sequences in the four japanese strains were confirmed ).

a gene for an amino acid utilization
an ortholog of jhp <dig> in j <dig> is absent from  <dig>  <cit> . an ortholog is present in the six other hpeurope strains and both hspwafrica strains, but absent from all hpeastasia strains  ). it encodes a homolog of 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate dehydrogenase and the related beta-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase . the 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate dehydrogenase degrades the branched-chain amino acid valine. h. pylori requires branched amino acids for growth. it is not known what the substrates or products of reactions catalyzed by this gene product are, or the biological relevance of its distribution.

gene contents unique to other groups
phylogenetic profiling involving four groups  , second sheet) revealed the following group-specific genes:

 tas  for aldo-ketoreductase was present in all hpeurope strains except one  and one hspwafrica strain , but was absent from all hpeastasia strains . aldo-keto reductases  constitute a large protein superfamily of mainly nad-dependent oxidoreductases involved in carbonyl metabolism  <cit> . this gene is fragmented in h. acinonychis strain sheeba  <cit> .

 homb encoding an outer membrane protein was present in all but two  hpeurope strains  but absent from the others. this result is in agreement with an earlier study  <cit> .

 trl was detected in all hpeastasia  strains and 2/ <dig> hpeurope strains . it is present between trna and trna, and co-transcribed with trna  <cit> . it is found in roughly half the clinical isolates in ireland  <cit> . its homologs are present at two loci in  <dig>  <cit> .

 a part of xsea for exonuclease vii large subunit was duplicated in all the hspamerind strains but the strain pecan <dig>  escherichia coli exonuclease vii degrades single-stranded dna and contributes to dna damage repair and methyl-directed dna mismatch repair to avoid mutagenesis  <cit> . this part of xsea was present in the neighbor of  <dig> other genes in these hspamerind strains. these  <dig> genes may form a genomic island.

 is <dig> transposase gene was present in all hspamerind and hspwafrica strains, and one hpeurope  strain, but was absent from the others.

 most of feca- <dig> gene, a feca paralog, was deleted in the hspamerind strains. the feca gene, for iron  dicitrate transport protein, is important under aerobic conditions  <cit> . there are several links between iron metabolism and oxidative stress defense in h. pylori  <cit> .

 the hopz omp gene was split in the hspamerind strains. the hopz gene is involved in adhesion  <cit> .

 the hopq omp gene decayed in the hpeastasia strains . this observation agrees with an earlier work  <cit> .

 h. pylori can ferment pyruvate to ethanol via an alcohol dehydrogenase  <cit> . duplication of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene as in j <dig>   <cit>  was seen only in the two hspwafrica strains .

prophage-related genomic islands and other mobile elements
except for the cag pathogenicity island , five genomic islands  were identified in the genomes of the four japanese strains . in f <dig>  the cagpai was flanked by a 44-bp direct repeat, which extended the 22-bp sequence found in the other strains . this length of sequence identity would allow homologous recombination  <cit>  leading to the excision of cagpai flanked by the repeat.

a gi found in strain f <dig> lacked similarity to known gis of h. pylori whereas the other four gis were homologous to transposable elements tnpzs, as recently reported  <cit> . the gi in f <dig> appears to be a remnant of a prophage inserted into a restriction-modification system . it is homologous to the 5'-half of the hac ii prophage found in h. acinonychis sheeba. the f <dig> gi appeared to have lost its 3'-half, presumably through deletion mediated by the inserted is <dig> copy. the gi included putative phage integrase genes  that suggest the mobility of this region, and a dna primase gene . the gene  next to the dna primase gene had weak sequence similarity to a putative phage helicase gene , which can be assumed to be the primase-helicase system found in several bacteriophages such as t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> . recently, a partial hac ii prophage region was reported for another h. pylori strain  <cit> .

the other four gis in the other three strains had sequence similarity to tnpzs  <cit> . one gi in f <dig> was entirely homologous to the type  <dig> tnpz inserted into the coding region for a dna methyltransferase with 8-bp target duplication  . the gi in f <dig> appeared to have been deleted by a type  <dig> tnpz . among the korean strains, a type  <dig> tnpz was observed only in strain  <dig> 

the plasmid in f <dig>  was similar in sequence to known theta replication plasmids with a repb family  replication protein and r <dig> iterons  <cit> .

the plasmid in f <dig>  was similar to a group of previously characterized h. pylori plasmids such as phel <dig> in h. pylori  <cit> . this carries genes for microcin , mccb , mccc , mobbcd , a replication initiator protein, and two relaxases. when compared to other related plasmids, a substitution in mobb and a deletion covering several small orfs were seen. homologous plasmids are found in g <dig> , p <dig> , and v225d  <cit> . hpag <dig>  <cit> , b <dig>  <cit> , pecan <dig> and sat <dig> carry a similar plasmid without the mccbc genes.

insertion sequences  were searched for in the japanese strains using gib-is  <cit> . an apparently intact known is was detected in two strains: is <dig> in f16; is <dig> in f <dig> 

divergence of genes between the east asian  and the european  strains
we systematically examined the amino acid-based phylogenetic trees of the orthologous genes  common to the six hspeasia genomes and the seven hpeurope genomes. trees of  <dig> ogs were selected with genes of the hspeasia strains forming a sub tree with no genes of the hpeurope strains and vice versa. each of the orthologs was plotted according to two distance parameters: da for the hspeasia-hpeurope divergence and db for intra-hspeasia divergence . an hspeasia-hpeurope divergence greater than twice that of the well-defined core tree  was seen in  <dig> gene families ). these genes were further divided by the intra-hspeasia divergence  into zone  <dig> , zone  <dig>  and zone  <dig>  . six typical trees are depicted in figure 8c. the caga tree   has large da and db values and a low db/da value, primarily because of the divergence in a c-terminal region of the orf. this region, including sequences known as epiya  motif, is involved in host interaction  <cit> . the tree here is consistent with previous results  <cit> .

 a homolog in the draft genome sequence of another east asian strain 98- <dig> has been reported to be diverged from four western strains  <cit> . the other genes listed as diverged in 98- <dig>  <cit> , hp <dig>  hp <dig>  hp <dig>  hp <dig> and hp <dig>  did not meet the criteria of this study. hp <dig> was below the da threshold; for the others, the hspeasia genes did not form a separate sub tree from hpeurope.

this tree-based analysis effectively extracted known pathogenesis-related genes  as discussed below. the list also included several genes related to antibiotics. amino acid alignments  located the divergent sites. the distribution pattern of these sequences suggests a possible relationship between structure and function as detailed below for each protein. the divergence could be related to differential activity and adaptation.

the variable da for an orthologous group is expected to be sensitive to the presence of a member with an exceptional phylogeny. the strain b <dig>  assigned to hpeurope in this work ), has been adapted to a mongolian gerbil  <cit> . the strain sjm <dig>  also assigned to hpeurope based on the tree of seven mlst genes ), clustered with hspwafrica strains rather than with hpeurope strains in the tree of the well-defined core genes . to examine robustness of the above classification into diverged genes, the same analysis was conducted using the  <dig> hspeasia strains and  <dig> hpeurope strains excluding b <dig> and sjm <dig> ). these two analyses used all the  <dig> strains, because we expected inclusion of the hspamerind and hspwafrica strains may provide better classification of the sub trees. in addition to these two analyses, analysis with the  <dig> hspeasia and  <dig> hpeurope strains or with the  <dig> hspeasia and  <dig> hpeurope strains was carried out, which allowed assignment of a bootstrap value to the branch separating the hspeasia and hpeurope strains. comparison of these  <dig> analyses is summarized in additional file  <dig> . the four sets of results agreed rather well, especially for those genes with larger da value:  <dig> among the  <dig> genes in table  <dig> were extracted in all the  <dig> analyses. the bootstrap value supported the separation of hspeasia and hpeurope well in most cases, with the bootstrap value â¥  <dig> in  <dig> among the  <dig> genes.

positively-selected amino-acid changes between the east asian  and european  strains
divergence could be adaptive or neutral. we searched for sites where the hspeasia-hpeurope changes in amino acids were positively selected  <cit>  and found that  <dig> of  <dig> genes passed the likelihood test . these selected sites were mapped on the coding sequences . for caga, several sites were found outside the area of epiya segments.

a) bonferonni adjusted.

b) posterior probabilities of dn/ds >  <dig> 

c) positions are for h. pylori  <dig>  residues were aligned at the same site by both mafft  <cit>  and prank  <cit> .

d) two vaca genes  were eliminated because they belonged to different subtypes of the gene.

three-dimensional structure was available for mapping some of the selected sites for three of these genes . the three-dimensional structure of part of vaca, the p <dig> fragment, is determined  <cit> . s793a mapped on the surface of the p <dig> at its c-terminal region . deletion of the p <dig> region reduces vaca binding to cells  <cit> , so s793a might affect cell binding of the hspeasia and hpeurope strains. two selected residues of hpaa- <dig> were mapped . the residue  corresponding to the selected residue h <dig> of h. pylori miaa mapped to the alpha helix  <dig> of e. coli miaa  <cit>  .

diverged genes and possible biological significance
we explored the possible biological significance of the observed divergence in genes in table  <dig> using gene and protein properties, as summarized in table  <dig> 

known virulence genes
four genes in table  <dig>  caga, vaca, hcpd and tipÎ±, are virulence genes.

caga is introduced in the background section and discussed above in the section "divergence of genes between the east asian  and the european  strains". vaca is another important virulence protein  <cit> . the hcpd  is a member of the hcp  family, which contains repeat motifs characteristic to the eukaryotic sel <dig> regulatory proteins, is secreted and interacts with the host immune systems  <cit> . geographical divergence and positive selection for amino acid changes in this family, including hcpd, are reported  <cit> . hp <dig> encodes tumor necrosis factor alpha-inducing protein , a dna-binding protein  <cit> . this enters the gastric cells and induces tnf-alpha, an essential cytokine for tumor promotion.

the caga gene is discussed above in the section "divergence of genes between the east asian  and the european  strains". the vaca gene showed a qualitatively similar pattern of intra-hspeasia divergence and overall divergence as caga ). the overall tree pattern was consistent with previous studies . intra-hspeasia divergence was large for hcpd. positively-selected residues of caga and vaca are described above.

outer membrane proteins
nine genes in table  <dig> are outer membrane protein genes .

the vaca gene is discussed above. vaca- <dig> is a vaca paralog. the hpaa- <dig> is of unknown function  <cit> , but is a paralog of hpaa  <cit>  which is essential for adhesion  <cit> . the homa/b genes are homologs of homc and known to have diverse copy number and genomic localization in western and east asian strains   <cit> . oipa  induces il- <dig> from host cells  <cit> . geographical divergence of oipa has been reported  <cit> .

the hpaa- <dig> showed a very large hspeasia-hpeurope divergence .

intra-hspeasia divergence was intermediate for oipa/oipa- <dig> .

the da value  of homc  was larger than the threshold distance . moreover, the homc genes of all hpeastasia and hpafrica <dig> strains but the strain  <dig> were greatly diverged from those of the hpeurope strains and the strain 52: distance  <dig>  for this separation was comparable to the largest da values for hpaa- <dig> and caga. diverged residues were clustered in a specific region. positively selected amino-acid changes of the putative homc product were identified .

the hopj and hopk genes  were similar within each strain but different between strains  <cit> . this earlier observation, seen for  <dig>  j <dig> and hpag <dig>  was confirmed with the other genomes except for  <dig> and b <dig>  this similarity of hopj and hopk genes in one strain is likely to be caused by concerted evolution by homologous interaction, possibly with selection.

the baba and alpa genes were not included in the  <dig> ogs that showed complete separation between genes of the six hspeasia strains and those of the seven hpeurope strains on the phylogenetic tree. baba binds to lewis b antigens  <cit> . geographic variation of baba has been reported  <cit> . alpab proteins are necessary for specific adherence to human gastric tissue  <cit> . in the east asian strains but not the western strains, alpa activates nf-Îºb-related pro-inflammatory signaling pathways  <cit> .

the reason that the baba is not in table  <dig> was mainly because baba genes of the hpeurope strains b <dig> and sjm <dig> grouped together with the hspeasia strains ). the alpa in the hpeurope strain sjm <dig> grouped with the hspeasia strains ).

lipopolysaccharide synthesis and lewis antigen mimicry
three genes in table  <dig>  futa, futb and hp <dig> , are related to lipopolysaccharide  synthesis and lewis antigen mimicry.

the lipopolysaccharides of h. pylori are important for host interaction. h. pylori can express lewis and related antigens in the o-chains of its surface lipopolysaccharide that mimic the hosts. o-chains are commonly composed of internal lewis x units with terminal lewis x or lewis y units or, in some strains, with additional units of lewis a, lewis b, lewis c, sialyl-lewis x and h- <dig> antigens, as well as blood groups a and b, producing a mosaic of antigenic units  <cit> . the activity and specificity of the fucosyltransferases may vary between the two paralogs in one strain, as well as between the orthologs in different strains  <cit> . mechanism of these changes is phase variation involving simple repeats and longer repeats  <cit> . such diversity could be adaptive and related to differences in pathogenicity  <cit> .

the two fucosyltransferase genes  showed large hpeurope-hspeasia divergence , as reported earlier  <cit> . intra-hspeasia divergence was large for them . hp <dig>  was Î²- <dig> -n-acetyl-glucosaminyl transferase gene for lps synthesis. another transfereaseÎ±- <dig> -glucosyltransferase gene  was in the list of  <dig> hspeasia -  <dig> hpeurope comparison ).

transport
four genes in table  <dig>  sotb, secg, yajc, comh and cvpa, are related to motility and chemotaxis.

the sotb gene was similar to genes for sugar efflux transporters and multi-drug resistance transporters . secg forms the machinery for protein translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane  <cit> . yajc is a member of the preprotein translocase machinery, secdf-yajc. secdf-yajc inhibits disulfide bond formation between two secg molecules  <cit> . comh is essential for natural transformation  <cit> . its putative n-terminal secretion signal suggests that it is either anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane or exported to the periplasm  <cit> . the cvpa gene of e. coli is suggested to encode a membrane protein required for colicin v production/secretion  <cit> .

the secg homolog, mhp <dig>  showed divergence focused around residues 150- <dig>  the nucleotide sequence aaagagaag encoding lys-glu-asn was present once in hpeurope and hspwafrica strains whereas repeated  <dig> to  <dig> times in tandem in all hpeastasia strains .

positively-selected amino-acid changes of the putative sotb product were identified . of these, w186y lay at the end of a transmembrane helical region away from the substrate tranlocation pores.

motility and chemotaxis
four genes in table  <dig>  flit, flik, maf and chey, are related to motility and chemotaxis.

the flit product is a flagellar chaperone  <cit> , whereas the flik product controls the hook length of flagella  <cit> . the maf gene encodes a member of motility accessory family of flagellin-associated proteins implicated in flagellar assembly  <cit> . the chey gene  encodes a response regulator of a two-component signal transduction system regulating chemotaxis  <cit> . chey does not act as a transcriptional activator. instead, when activated, it interacts directly with the flagellar motor-switch complex, causing a clockwise rotation of the flagella that results in cell tumbling.

intra-hspeasia divergence was very small for chey ). it would be interesting to see whether this divergence is related to differences in chemotaxis.

electron transfer
seven genes in table  <dig>  fixq, fixs, frxa, hypd, hyde, pgl and nuof, are related to electron transfer.

aerobic respiration in h. pylori has been analyzed experimentally and by genome sequences. a cb-type cytochrome c oxidase is the sole terminal oxidase present in h. pylori  <cit> . fixq  is a component of the oxidase. the fixs gene likely encodes the cation transport subunit of the oxidase  <cit> . it has been proposed that fixs plays a role in the uptake and metabolism of copper required for oxidase assembly  <cit> . aerobic respiration results in production of toxic superoxide at this terminal oxidase, which is involved in bacterial death  <cit> . the frxa gene, nadh-flavin oxidoreductase, is involved in redox of flavins, which are important electron transfer mediators  <cit> . reduced flavins reduce ferric complexes or iron proteins with low redox potential. frxa is one of the enzymes that make h. pylori sensitive to metronidazole  <cit> . h. pylori is capable of hydrogen oxidation  <cit> . hypd is involved in maturation of the  h2-uptake hydrogenase, and catalyzes insertion and cyanation of the iron center  <cit> . the hyde gene is also necessary for the hydrogenase activity  <cit> . the pgl gene  encodes a 6-phosphogluconolactonase, which catalyzes the second step of the phosphopentose pathway. this phase of the phosphopentose pathway generates reducing power in the form of nadph and is important in other organisms in defense against reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress response  <cit> .

intra-hspeasia divergence was very small for fixq , table  <dig> and table 6).

translation
four genes in table  <dig>  miaa, tils, def, and prma, are important for translation.

miaa and tils affects translation fidelity  <cit> . miaa isopentenyl-trna transferase modifies the trnas that read codons starting with u to minimize peptidyl-trna slippage in translation. tils, the trna lysidine synthetase, modifies cytidine to lysidine  at the first anticodon of trna, thereby switching trna from a methionine-specific to an isoleucine-specific trna. def removes a formyl group from the n-terminus of a nascent polypeptide and is a potential drug target  <cit> . prma is a trimethyltransferase that methyates multiple residues in the n-terminal domain of ribosomal protein l <dig>  a universally conserved component of the large ribosomal subunit  <cit> .

there was evidence that divergence in miaa was adaptive , and the relevant amino acid residue was mapped on the structure , as described above. intra-hspeasia divergence was not large for def , whereas large for miaa .

nucleases
four genes in table  <dig>  adda, rnha, rnhb and hsdr, are nucleases.

adda  is a recb-like helicase that promotes dna recombination repair and survival during colonization  <cit> . upon encounter with a dna double-strand break, e. coli recbcd enzyme degrades non-self dna, but repairs self dna marked by a genomic identification sequence through reca-mediated homologous recombination. the identification sequence varies among bacterial groups  <cit>  and can be altered by a mutation in recbcd  <cit> .

the rnha and rnhb genes encode rnase hi and rnase hii, which hydrolyze rna hybridized to dna. their biological role remains unclear, although they affect dna replication, repair and transcription  <cit> .

an at-rich region of the adda gene linking the helicase domain and the nuclease domain showed an interesting divergence: the sequence aaagaaagaaa encoding lys-glu-ser-lys was repeated in tandem  <dig> to  <dig> times in the hspwafrica and hpeurope strains but was absent or present only once in the hspeasia strains. the hspamerind strains have a single copy  or two copies .

cell division
gene ftsa encodes an actin-like, membrane-associated protein that interacts with the tubulin-like ftsz protein, helps it assemble into the z ring, anchors it to the cytoplasmic membrane, and recruits other proteins for cell division  <cit> . it is a potential drug target  <cit> .

amino acid
the ilve gene  encodes a branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase that generates glutamic acid from branched-chain amino acids  that are essential to h. pylori. we do not know whether its divergence is related to loss of jhp <dig>  encoding a branched-amino-acid dehydrogenase, in all hpeastasia strains , or whether it is related to a possible geographical divergence in the amino acid content of food.

discussion
we closely compared complete genome sequences through phylogenetic profiling, phylogenetic tree construction, and nucleotide sequence analysis. the results distinguished decaying from intact genes and revealed drastic evolutionary changes within the h. pylori species. our results clearly define the h. pylori east asian lineage as distinct at the genome level from the african, european or amerind lineages . the east asian lineage consists of japanese and korean genomes and corresponds to hspeasia in the phylogenetic tree of the concatenated seven genes used for multi-locus sequence typing. the hspeasia and hspamerind lineages form a phylogenetic group hpeastasia. the outstanding differences are in proteins related to:  host-interaction;  electron transfer and redox metabolism; and  translation fidelity.

host-interaction proteins
many of the virulence factors show wide divergence between hspeasia and hpeurope, most likely because of co-evolution with the host. we anticipate that the list of well-diverged genes  is enriched for host-interaction and potential virulence genes. we detected positively-selected amino-acid changes in two virulence factors: caga and vaca .

many omp families showed loss of one of their resident loci , whereas one family  showed duplication of its locus. some omp genes showed internal deletions  or interallelic homologous recombination . a group-specific repertoire was seen for other omp genes , for other criteria. we also found substantial hspeasia-hpeurope divergence in many omps . the omps play important roles in host interaction such as adhesion to the host cells and induction of immune responses  <cit> . for example, oipa induces il- <dig> from host cells  <cit> . systematic decay of omp genes occurred during adaptation of h. pylori to a new host of large felines, generating the new species of h. acinonychis  <cit> . hence, the above omp changes might reflect selection and/or fine regulation in host interaction, and more specifically, may help avoid the host immune system. at least two omps show evidence for positive selection . we do not yet know whether these omp changes are related to immune response or adhesin activity.

lewis antigen mimicry is important for gastric colonization and adhesion. the mimicry affects innate immune recognition, inflammatory response, and t-cell polarization. long-term infection by h. pylori might induce autoreactive anti-lewis antigen antibodies  <cit> . divergence in transferase genes for lps biosynthesis may have resulted from co-evolution with the host immune system and could be related to changes in lewis antigens in human populations. for example, the le phenotype is almost absent in caucasian persons whereas it occurs with a higher frequency in the asian population  <cit> . this might be related to differences in pathogenicity and adaptation  <cit> .

changes in transporter genes, the loss of a putative amino acid utilization gene, divergence in a branched chain amino acid metabolism gene, differences in acetate metabolism genes, and divergence in motility and chemotaxis genes could also be related to host interaction, because these are related to the stomach environment. an interesting question is if these changes are related to variation in human diets.

electron transfer
several key electron transfer components were diverged between hspeasia and hpeurope. the multiple and drastic changes in redox metabolism were unexpected. the systematic decay of all mo-related genes through mutations in all  hspeasia strains was the most striking. we do not know whether our findings reflect the biased environmental occurrence of mo or the dietary habits of human populations. the richest sources of mo include legumes, cereal grains , leafy vegetables, milk, beans, liver, and kidney, whereas fruits, stem and root vegetables, and muscle meats are poor mo sources  <cit> .

the bisc homolog, the only molybdoenzyme found in the h. pylori genome, is similar to a number of periplasmic reductases for alternative oxidants such as dimethylsulfoxide or trimethylamine n-oxide  <cit> . western strains of h. pylori might be able to use n- and/or s-oxide as an electron acceptor in energy metabolism in addition to oxygen and fumarate. one hypothesis about decay of the mo-related genes is that this anaerobic electron transport system became maladaptive in the east asian lineage. one possibility is the radical reaction mediated by moaa in molybdopterin synthesis is dangerous in the presence of oxygen. this could explain the observed changes in oxidative phosphorylation and acetate metabolism.

a candidate for the bisc substrate is an oxidized form of methionine, free or within a protein. methionine is sensitive to oxidation, which converts it to a racemic mixture of methionine-s-sulfoxide  and methionine-r-sulfoxide   <cit> . the reductive repair of oxidized methionine residues performed by methionine sulfoxide reductase is important in many pathogenic bacteria in general, and specifically for h. pylori to maintain persistent stomach colonization  <cit> . h. pylori methionine sulfoxide reductase  is induced under oxidative stress control and can repair methionine-r-sulfoxide but not the s isomer, even though it is a fusion of an r-specific and an s-specific enzyme  <cit> . bisc from other bacteria can reduce and repair the s but not the r form  <cit> .

if the sole function of bisc is to repair methionine-s-sulfoxide, another means to repair methionine-s-sulfoxide may have appeared in the east asian h. pylori, for example by higher expression of msr. in this case, bisc may have been inactivated because mo-related reactions were no longer necessary. the substitution by a dna element downstream of the msr gene in the hspeasia strains  could be involved in the hypothesized methionine-s-sulfoxide repair activity of its product.

another possibility is decrease of oxidative stress generating methionine-s-sulfoxide in the east asian h. pylori. oxidative stress is induced by acid exposure, and msr is among the oxidative stress genes induced by acid  <cit> . h. pylori infection has different effects on acid secretion in europe and asia  <cit> . in europe, antral-predominant gastritis with increased acid secretion is frequent, whereas in asia, pan-gastritis and subsequent atrophic gastritis with decreased acid secretion are common. the decrease in acid experienced by east asian h. pylori lineages may have decreased their methionine-s-sulfoxide and made its repair by bisc unnecessary.

downregulation of some of the mo-related genes in a european strain under acidic conditions may be related to their decay  <cit> . downregulation may occur to avoid the possible toxic effects of mo metabolism under conditions of acid adaptation.

taken together, our results led us to predict that the east asian h. pylori strains are different from the european strains in electron transfer reactions and responses to oxygen and acid. possibly related to this alteration in redox is the presence of the two acetate-related pathways in  <dig> out of  <dig> japanese strains. these are expected to be able to switch from acetate fermentation to acetate utilization under aerobic conditions, as seen for e. coli  <cit> . the european strains, some of the hspamerind strains, and the other hspeasia strains may be regarded as mutants that lack the pta-acka pathway and the supposedly important acetyl~p signal. global effects of these defects on chemotaxis, nitrogen and phosphate assimilation, osmo-regulation, flagellar biogenesis, biofilm development, and pathogenicity are expected, based on the various phenotypes of e. coli strains defective in these genes  <cit> .

translation fidelity
translational proteins also diverged between hpeurope and hspeasia strains. miaa -isopentenylpyrophosphate transferase) and tils  affect accuracy in elongation. the amino-acid change in miaa turned out to be adaptive . tils affects translation efficiency at various stages. ambiguity in translation is proposed to be important in the evolution of novel proteins by generating phenotypic and genetic diversity in the proteome for selection  <cit> . this role of ambiguity is similar to the evolutionary role of genome-wide modulation of mutation rates by genes such as muts  <cit> .

implications for medicine
east asian  h. pylori appear to be quite different from european h. pylori. our results provide a solid starting point for understanding the biology, host interaction, and pathogenesis of the east asian h. pylori, which in most previous works were inferred from a european strain. divergences included virulence, cell surface-related, and drug target genes. these results will affect our strategy in developing effective therapies and drugs. questions raised by our findings include whether east asian vaca  interacts with host cells in the same way as european vaca.

the diverged gene frxa is associated with resistance to antibiotics metronidazole  <cit> , which is frequently used in h. pylori eradication. the divergence in the frxa could affect resistance to this group of drugs in various ways. more generally, if redox metabolism differs between hspeasia and hpeurope strains, the same drug might produce different effects, depending on intra-bacterial redox reactions.

the diverged genes included two potential drug targets , so drugs that target these proteins may have different effects in east asian and european strains. we do not know, for example, whether anti-h. pylori drugs designed from structure of european def  <cit>  will be as effective against east asian h. pylori.

remaining questions
clearly, many studies are needed to answer these and other questions raised by the genomics results presented here. phylogenetic analysis in the present study used ogs where genes of hspeasia were clustered separately from those of hpeurope. some genes do not share this topology, as suggested above for acoe deletion and hopmn recombination. we plan to study the distortion in the tree. we focused on differences between a limited numbers of strains from each group. however, there are variations within east asian strains . further experimental examination of the divergence within hspeasia, and between hspeasia and the other strains are necessary to understand their divergence in detail. such examination might reveal complexity in evolution and will be the subject of a separate study. the mechanisms underlying the variation, such as mutations and rearrangements, will be a subject of a separate study  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
taking advantage of the extreme genome plasticity of h. pylori, we demonstrated how drastically a genome can change during evolution within a species. our results revealed drastic changes in proteins for host interaction and electron transfer and suggested their importance in adaptive evolution. these results define the h. pylori east asian and western lineages at the genome level, enhance our understanding of their host interaction, and contribute to the design of effective drugs and therapies. the approach of fine comparative analysis of closely-related multiple genomes may reveal subtle but important evolutionary changes in other populations.
