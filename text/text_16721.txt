BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small , non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by complementarily pairing to mrnas of protein-coding genes, resulting in either translational suppression or degradation of targeted mrnas  <cit> . mirnas are produced through multiple mechanisms. some mirnas are produced by processing independent transcripts of individual mirna-coding genes, whereas others are derived from co-transcripts of genes encoding polycistronic mirnas  <cit> . in addition, mirnas can also be produced by processing introns of protein-coding genes  <cit> . since the first report in  <dig>  identification of new mirnas has been advancing rapidly  <cit> . by the end of july  <dig>  over  <dig>  mirna sequences have been deposited to the database mirbase  <cit> . mirna genes are estimated to represent up to 1% of total genes in a eukaryotic genome, and therefore, database sequences may represent only a small portion of existing mirna genes  <cit> . among the known mirnas, some are evolutionally conserved among different organisms, whereas others are species-specific. conserved mirnas are likely to regulate common genes with basic functions, whereas species-specific mirnas may be involved in traits associated with individual species. mirnas are reported to be involved in cell differentiation, metabolism, disease development, immunological defense, and stress response  <cit> . through regulating the expression levels of different types of genes, mirnas may be implicated in every biological process.

the gall midge mayetiola destructor, commonly known as the hessian fly, is a member of the cecidomyiidae, one of the largest families within the order of diptera  <cit> . hessian fly is a destructive pest of wheat and may cause an average of 5% annual loss in wheat production in the us  <cit> . the insect possesses many interesting biological traits, including its ability to manipulate the development of its host plants  <cit> , fast adaption to host resistance  <cit> , genomic imprinting  <cit>  and extensive e-chromosome elimination  <cit> . a single hessian fly larva can effectively convert a whole host plant into a gall by inducing formation of nutritive cells at the feeding site, irreversibly inhibiting plant growth, and suppressing plant defense  <cit> . at the population level, hessian fly can rapidly adapt to changes in host plants and defeat plant resistance mediated by resistance genes within as short as three years  <cit> . it is likely that mirnas are involved in some of these traits associated with hessian fly since mirnas are involved in regulating a wide range of genes  <cit> . the hessian fly is also becoming a model organism for studying plant – insect interactions due to its well-characterized genetics, availability of genome sequence, and ease of culture in the laboratory  <cit> . identification of mirnas and examination of their function may reveal the potential roles of mirna in hessian fly biology and host interactions, and provide a foundation for studying mirna involvement in gall midge biology in general.

multiple approaches can be adapted for identification of mirnas. computational prediction of potential mirna-encoding genes can be made from genome sequences based on conservation of mature mirnas and the characteristic ‘hairpin’ structures of their precursors  <cit> . predicted mirnas can be further validated by expression methods such as microarrays and pcr analysis. mirnas can also be identified directly by deep sequencing mirna libraries constructed from isolated small-rna samples. because mirnas regulate gene expression by direct pairing, potential regulatory targets can also be predicted computationally by searching for complementary sequence similarity  <cit> . the objectives of this study are to use a combination of deep sequencing of hessian fly larval mirna transcriptomes and computational prediction to systematically identify mirna species in the hessian fly genome and to identify specific mirnas that might be involved in insect – plant interactions.

RESULTS
identification of mirnas by deep sequencing the mirna transcriptome
the first instar larva is the life stage of hessian fly that determines the outcome of an infestation, resulting in the host plant becoming resistant or susceptible  <cit> . to identify mirnas likely to be involved in establishment of the interaction between hessian fly larvae and their host, total rna was isolated from first instar larvae. small rnas, with  <dig> –  <dig> nucleotides long, were size-selected through gel electrophoresis, and were used for library construction. the libraries were then sequenced on an illumina gaiix system . a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained. the raw data are available at the national center for biotechnology information  short-read archive . the raw sequences were processed through several steps of filtering to remove: 1) low quality sequences , which represented  <dig> % of the raw sequences; 2) sequences with copy number < <dig> and sizes either < <dig> or > <dig> nucleotides, which represented  <dig> % of high quality sequences; and 3) other non-coding rnas including rrna, trna, snrna, and snorna, as well as degraded mrna species, which represented 27% of the processed sequences .

the resulting  <dig> , <dig> sequences were kept as candidates for mirna analysis. the size distribution of mirna candidate sequences is shown in figure  <dig>  the majority  of the sequences were  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides long with  <dig> and  <dig> groups as the predominant species, each representing  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. the high proportion of  <dig> nucleotide sequences was characteristic of the hessian fly larval mirna transcriptome, which was different from similar studies with other organisms  <cit> . after clustering mirna candidate sequences based on sequence similarity,  <dig>  unique sequences were obtained, which represented  <dig> mirna families . among the  <dig> families,  <dig> were similar or identical to existing mirnas in mirbase, whereas the remaining  <dig> were novel mirnas. the  <dig> similar mirnas had an average frequency of  <dig>  whereas the  <dig> novel mirnas had an average frequency of  <dig> .

genome-wide survey of potential mirna-encoding genes
to systematically identify orthologs of other known insect mirnas in the hessian fly genome and paralogs of the new mirnas identified through deep sequencing, a total of  <dig>  insect mature mirna sequences were downloaded from mirbase  <cit> . after removing identical sequences,  <dig> unique insect mirnas were obtained. these unique insect mirna sequences and the newly identified hessian fly mirnas were used to search a draft hessian fly genome sequence to identify potential mirna-encoding genes using a locally developed algorithm  <cit> . the parameters of the algorithm were set so that two mismatches were allowed for mirna sequences with  <dig> nucleotides or less and three mismatches were allowed for mirna sequences with more than  <dig> nucleotides. under these criteria, a total of  <dig>  loci were identified in the hessian fly genome sequence from both dna strands. a dna sequence from each locus, containing a putative mature mirna coding region and additional flanking sequences of  <dig> nucleotides from both the 5′- and 3′- regions was extracted from the genome sequence, and used to determine the existence of a stem-loop pre-mirna structure using mfold  <cit> . the results are shown in figure  <dig> and additional file 3: figure s <dig>  of the  <dig>  loci,  <dig> have extended sequence that can form a stem-loop structure characteristic of mirna . among the  <dig> putative mirna genes identified in the hessian fly genome, only  <dig> genes were found to match with known mature mirna from other insects; the remaining  <dig>  putative mirna genes encode novel mirnas. the  <dig> mirna genes corresponding to known insect mirnas contained  <dig> different mirna families with an average of  <dig>  members per family . strikingly, the  <dig> mirna genes corresponding to newly identified hessian fly mirnas contained only  <dig> families, with an average of  <dig>  members per family. the relatively larger number of genes per family of newly identified mirnas was due to the existence of several expanded families. the three largest families, pc-5p- <dig>  pc-3p- <dig>  and pc-5p- <dig> contained  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> different genes, respectively .

different mirnas exhibited different levels of abundance in hessian fly larvae
to examine the expression of the identified mirna genes in hessian fly larvae, we took advantage of an existing microarray that contained probes corresponding to  <dig> known insect mirna . the raw data of the microarray analysis were deposited in ncbi database with accession number gse <dig>  sequence analysis revealed that  <dig> probe sequences matched perfectly and  <dig> probes had one mismatch with identified hessian fly mirnas . to examine the expression levels of different mirnas, microarray analysis was conducted with rna samples extracted from first instar larvae that fed on susceptible plants for one or three days. validation by real-time pcr  was carried out with selected transcripts . overall, only a few probes detected high levels of hybridization signal , about one-third detected intermediate levels of hybridization signal , one-third detected low levels of hybridization signal , and one-third detected essentially no signal  . probes corresponding to mde-mir-1-3p and mde-mir-8-3p detected the highest levels of hybridization signal . interestingly, probes corresponding to drosophila mirnas dme-mir <dig> and dme-mir- <dig>  for which the corresponding hessian fly mirnas have not yet been identified, also detected the same high levels of hybridization signal. probes corresponding to mde-mir-2b-3p, mde-mir-10-3p, mde-mir-184-3p, mde-mir-252-5p, and mde-mir-2779-5p also detected relatively high levels of hybridization .

abundance of mirnas changes at different larval growth stages
several mirnas exhibited significant differences in abundance between one- and three-day old larvae . some mirnas were less abundant in three-day hessian fly larvae compared with one-day larvae, whereas others were more abundant in three-day larvae than in one-day larvae. the mirnas mde-mir-10-5p, mde-mir-137-3p, mde-mir- <dig>  and the one corresponding to dmo-mir- <dig> were relatively abundant in one-day larvae. the abundance of these four mirnas decreased more than two fold in three-day hessian fly larvae. on the other hand, the abundance of mirnas mde-mir-305-5p, mde-mir-9c-5p, and the one corresponding to dme-mir- <dig> increased more than two fold in three-day hessian fly larvae in comparison with that in one-day larvae.

rna samples were extracted from 1-day and 3-day old larvae, converted to crnas, and hybridized to microarrays. data were derived from three biological replicates with three duplicates for each replicate. rows in boldface represent hybridization results of probes produced according to mirnas from other insect species, to which the corresponding mirnas from hessian fly have not yet been identified. p ≤  <dig> .

host plant genotypes affect mirna gene expression
some mirnas exhibited very different levels of abundance in hessian fly larvae depending on the plant genotypes on which they were feeding . newton and molly wheat lines are nearly isogenic lines, with newton the susceptible recurrent parent of molly, which contains the resistance gene h <dig> <cit> . a range of different patterns in mirna abundance were observed in larvae feeding in resistant molly plants in comparison with those feeding on susceptible newton plants. the patterns of differences included: 1) higher mirna abundance in both one- and three-day old larvae feeding in molly plants in comparison with larvae feeding in newton plants during the same period, represented by mde-mir-34-5p , mde-mir-994-5p and mde-mir-263b-5p ; 2) higher mirna abundance specifically in three-day larvae feeding in molly plants, represented by mde-mir-286-3p, mde-mir-2944-3p , mde-mir-210-5p, mde-mir-989-3p, mde-mir-971-3p, mde-mir-11-3p, and mde-mir-87a-3p ; 3) lower mirna abundance in both one- and three-day old larvae feeding in molly plants, represented by the mirna corresponding to dme-mir- <dig>  and mde-mir- <dig> ; and additional file 6: figure s4) lower mirna abundance specifically in three-day larvae feeding in molly plants, represented by mde-mir-276b-3p, mde-mir-9a-5p , and mde-mir-2779-5p .

discussion
using deep sequencing and homology-based prediction, we identified  <dig> putative mirnas and their encoding genes from the gall midge mayetiola destructor, an important member of a large group of insects that have unique biology in terms of insect – host plant interactions  <cit> . among the identified mirnas,  <dig> are identical or highly similar to known mirnas from other insect species. these common mirnas are likely to play common roles in insect growth and development.

in addition, a total of  <dig> new mirnas or putative mirnas were identified in this study. one interesting and so far unique feature of these new mirnas is the dramatic expansion of several mirna gene families. the expanded gene families include pc-3p- <dig> with nine genes, pc-5p- <dig> with  <dig> genes, pc-3p- <dig> with  <dig> genes, pc-3p- <dig> with  <dig> genes, pc-3p- <dig> with  <dig> genes, pc-5p- <dig> with  <dig> genes, pc-3p- <dig> with  <dig> genes, pc-5p- <dig> with  <dig> genes, pc-5p- <dig> with  <dig> genes, pc-3p- <dig> with  <dig> genes, and pc-5p- <dig> with  <dig> genes. the numbers of genes in these expanded families only included those genes that encode putative pre-mirnas that can form a typical stem-loop structure with a 140 bp region surrounding the mirna coding region. there are also many sequences that can form stem-loop structures within a longer sequence range, namely 210 bp regions surrounding the putative mirna coding region . these dna sequences could also encode mirnas, but were not included in this report. this expansion phenomenon of gene families was not observed with mirnas that share high sequence similarity with known mirnas from other insect species. a literature search revealed the existence of multi-gene families of mirnas in other species. for example, there are  <dig> paralogs of mir <dig> in the maize genome  <cit> . however, so far the expansion of mirna genes found in the hessian fly genome is the most dramatic, with as many as  <dig> genes in a single family.

the biological implication of the dramatic expansion of the hessian fly-specific mirnas remains to be determined. examination of putative mirna genes within a family revealed that mature mirna coding regions and the corresponding complementary regions for the stem-loop structure were highly conserved . for example,  <dig> out of the  <dig> members in the pc-5p- <dig> family were identical in the mirna coding region, and the remaining members differed by only one to three residues . in contrast, the regions surrounding the mirna coding and stem-loop region exhibited little sequence similarity . gene members in other expanded families showed similar conservation patterns but some families were less typical . the conservation in mirna coding regions and diversification in non-coding regions suggest that these mirna genes are functional. mirnas that vary by single or multiple residues, especially in the seed region , can have a different target spectrum and may perform very different regulatory functions since minor changes in sequence could remarkably affect target specificity or regulatory efficiencies. however, the reason remains to be determined for the existence of so many different genes in the hessian fly genome that encode identical mirnas. theoretically, identical products should have identical function. we hypothesize that these iso-mirna genes with different flanking regions may allow hessian fly to fine tune the expression levels of the same mirna product during different developmental stages or under different environments. if that is the case, the existence of so many iso-genes would suggest that the levels of the corresponding mirna need to be strictly regulated. further studies will have to be completed to determine the reason for the existence of so many iso-mirna genes and their regulatory mechanisms.

another interesting feature of the identified hessian fly mirnas is existence of the second peak at 25– <dig> nucleotides for the length distribution , which has not been reported from other species. since pirnas, another type of non-coding rnas, have a length distribution at around 26– <dig> nucleotides  <cit> , some of the identified mirnas with  <dig> nucleotides may actually be pirnas. indeed, all mirnas with  <dig> nucleotides have a u residue at position  <dig>  which is characteristic of pirnas. however, 61% of the  <dig> mirnas that are similar to known. this is mirna from other insects also have a u at position 1; and 46% of hessian fly-specific, non-26-nucleotide mirnas have a u at position  <dig>  too. it seems that u is the residue that occurs most frequently in mirnas of all sizes identified in this study. the genes coding for  <dig> nucleotide mirnas are scattered as single locus across the genome, whereas most known pirna genes are derived from discrete loci. all identified hessian fly pre-rna sequences for the mirnas with  <dig> nucleotides can form typical stem-loop structures that are observed in pre-mirnas, but not in pre-pirnas. based on these observations, the non-coding rnas of  <dig> nucleotides identified in this study are likely mirnas, not pirnas. the significance of the existence of a large number of mirnas with  <dig> nucleotides specifically in hessian fly genome remains to be determined.

the expression profiles of different mirnas varied dramatically in hessian fly larvae. some mirnas, for example mde-mir-1-3p and mde-mir-8-3p, were expressed at very high levels, whereas others, such as mde-mir-iab-4-5p and mde-mir-2a-5p, could not be detected at all in first instar larvae , indicating that mirna expression is strictly regulated as needed in hessian fly development. indeed many mirnas were stage-regulated . for example, the abundance of mde-mir-10-5p, mde-mir-1000-5p, and mde-mir-190-5p in one-day larvae decreased by more than 50% in three-day larvae compared to that in one-day larvae. in contrast, the abundance of mde-mir-305-5p, mde-mir-9c-5p, and mde-mir-965-3p increased more than 50% over the same two-day period. the strict regulation of mirna abundance in hessian fly larval development indicates opportunity for utilization of mirnas in pest control. for example, artificial introduction of mirnas or analogs that are not expressed in hessian fly larvae, through a transgenic approach could disrupt hessian fly larval development, resulting in insect death. small rna molecules ectopically expressed in host plants can be ingested by insects and transgenic plants with small interfering rna have been successfully developed for insect and other pest control  <cit> .

the potential application of mirnas as tools for pest management was also highlighted by the fact that abundance of mirnas was affected by host plant genotypes . some mirnas such as mde-mir-34-5p and mde-mir-994-5p became more abundant in hessian fly larvae feeding in resistant plants, whereas some others such as the ones corresponding to mde-mir- <dig> and dps-mir- <dig> became less abundant in insects feeding in the resistant plants. further research on potential target genes of the mirnas affected by host genotypes will increase our understanding of mirnas in hessian fly developmental control and in host plant resistance mechanism to the insect.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified and characterized, for the first time, a large number of mirnas from a gall midge belonging to a large group of insects that are of both economic importance and broad biological interest. the dramatic expansion of some mirna families that encode the same or very similar mirnas is an interesting phenomenon and further research on these gene families could shed new light on mirna expression regulation and their interactions with targeted mrna species. the distinct expression profiles of mirna species in hessian fly larvae suggests that manipulation of mirna abundance through transgenic plants may provide us opportunities to control this economically important insect pest.
