BACKGROUND
cholinergic neuromodulation is mediated by several basal forebrain  structures including the nucleus basalis of meynert , which send cholinergic projections to the cortex  <cit> . these cholinergic projections play an important role in various cognitive functions including learning, memory formation and attention  <cit> . behaviorally, immunotoxic lesions of the cholinergic system have profound effects on learning  <cit> , consistent with a large body of evidence linking the blockade of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors , as well as to a lesser extent the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors , to impairments in memory formation as well as stimulus discrimination and attention  <cit> . behavioral performance with novel stimuli appears to be particularly affected by machr blockade  <cit> . on the other hand, application of cholinergic agonists can have beneficial effects on behavioral performance. for example, nachr agonist application enhances the detection performance for low contrast stimuli  <cit>  and administration of the acetylcholine-esterase inhibitor physostigmine enhances attentional performance  <cit> . these behavioral effects are thought to be mediated by the impact of cholinergic neuromodulation on cortical information processing. thus, pairing cholinergic activation with sensory stimulation boosts subsequent responses to sensory stimuli in both auditory and visual cortex  <cit>  as well as promoting cortical map plasticity  <cit> . consistent with this, it has been shown that machrs play an important role in synaptic plasticity  <cit> .

effects of cholinergic neuromodulation on sensory processing have been extensively investigated using iontophoretic drug application, with much effort having been directed at studies of the primary visual cortex . early studies have described response increases following the application of cholinergic agonists  <cit>  and more recent work has begun to link particular aspects of cholinergic neuromodulation to specific receptor types and cortical laminae  <cit> . by comparison to this pharmacological work, there are relatively few studies examining how cortical processing is affected by electrical bf stimulation, which evokes endogenous acetylcholine  release in the cortex  <cit> . this is somewhat surprising given that bf stimulation is currently being tested for clinical use in patients suffering from brain disorders linked to cholinergic dysfunction such as alzheimer’s disease and lewy body dementia  <cit> . we therefore aimed to investigate the effects of bf stimulation on sensory processing in the visual cortex, and link the observed effects to our previous results of selective nachr and machr stimulation  <cit> . an important pertinent aspect is that the bf also sends substantial gabaergic projections to both cortex and thalamic structures  <cit> , providing additional routes by which the bf can exert an influence on cortical processing. in our analysis of bf stimulation effects, we focused on spectral changes in the v <dig> local field potential  in the absence of visual stimulation, and on the contrast sensitivity  <cit>  and orientation selectivity  <cit>  of v <dig> single  and multi-unit activity  in response to drifting grating stimuli.

RESULTS
we studied the effects of basal forebrain  microstimulation on neural responses in tree shrew v <dig> recorded using pairs or triplets of tetrodes . during each experiment, we first placed the tetrodes in the visual cortex and determined the approximate receptive field locations for multi-unit activity  on each tetrode. we then advanced the bf stimulation electrode on a vertical track towards the depth corresponding to the nbm, until stimulation triggered an increase in the γ-band  power of the v <dig> lfp. an example v <dig> lfp time course demonstrating this spectral change is shown in figure 1b. keeping the bf stimulation electrode at this location, we proceeded to record neural activity at different cortical depths in v <dig>  for each v <dig> location, we first estimated the lfp power spectral density  change triggered by bf stimulation in the absence of a visual stimulus. we then recorded spiking and lfp activity in v <dig> in response to drifting grating stimuli of varying contrast and orientation for visual stimulation alone and interleaved visual and bf stimulation . at the end of the recording sessions, we made multiple electrolytic lesions along the bf stimulation electrode track, and verified their position using cytochrome oxidase immunohistochemistry. an example is shown in figure 1d with three lesions, the lowest of which corresponded to the bf stimulation site located in the medial part of the nbm.

we first examined the effects of bf stimulation on visually evoked activity elicited by drifting grating stimuli that we presented at three contrast levels  and eight drift directions corresponding to four orientations. we studied multi-unit activity  at  <dig> sites located at different v <dig> cortical depths. for most sites, mua varied significantly  as a function of stimulus contrast  and bf stimulation , and about 1/ <dig> of the sites exhibited orientation selectivity . significant interactions were most common for contrast/bf stimulation , with only very few sites  showing other 2-way or 3-way interactions. a representative mua response, averaged across contrasts and orientations, is shown in figure 2a, demonstrating an approximately 4-fold elevation of activity from  <dig> to  <dig> hz following bf stimulation. similarly, across the population there was an average  <dig>  fold elevation of activity from  <dig>  to  <dig> hz following bf stimulation , with  <dig> units showing activity increases and only  <dig> showing reductions. the orientation tuning function at 100% contrast for this example unit is shown in figure 2b. in addition to generally elevating firing rate, bf stimulation resulted in an increased tuning height , and a reduction in orientation tuning as evidenced by a lower orientation selectivity index  and increased tuning width . for the same unit, the contrast response function  averaged across orientations is shown in figure 2c. fitting a naka-rushton function to these data, we found a robust elevation in baseline-subtracted peak firing rate  whereas baseline firing rate  was unaffected. contrast sensitivity was measured by the semi-saturation contrast  parameter that takes small values for units that exhibit robust activity already at relatively low contrast values. for the example unit, we observed reduced c <dig> values and thus increase in contrast sensitivity following bf stimulation.

we examined orientation tuning and contrast response parameters for the population of  <dig> mua sites, as well as for a population of  <dig> isolated single neurons . we observed a marked decrease in the contrast sensitivity c <dig> parameter for both mua and sua, as shown in figure 3a . amplitudes of orientation tuning and contrast response functions were increased for both mua and sua , as demonstrated by increases in th  and rmax  parameters. on the other hand, osi values were decreased  as shown in figure 3d, while tw parameters remained unchanged . decreased osi values despite unchanged tw and increased th can be explained by the upward shift of the orientation tuning function following bf stimulation, since the osi is invariant to multiplicative but not additive firing rate changes. none of the five parameters exhibited pronounced variations across cortical layers, as demonstrated by a lack of significant interactions between layer  and bf stimulation condition . overall, bf stimulation had similar effects on v <dig> mua and sua, increasing firing rates, while decreasing orientation selectivity and leading to a pronounced increase in contrast sensitivity.

a qualitative evaluation of the v <dig> lfp spectral changes triggered by bf stimulation revealed a number of different patterns, which are illustrated using some representative examples in figure  <dig>  since γ-band increase was used as criterion for stimulation position selection, this spectral feature was present at most sites. we commonly observed low frequency decreases accompanying the γ-band increases , and less frequently a joint elevation of both low and high frequencies, as shown in panel . in addition, bf stimulation sometimes elicited peaks in the γ-band that appeared to fall into two categories with center frequencies around  <dig> hz  and  <dig> hz . for a quantitative analysis of v <dig> lfp spectral changes, we examined a low frequency band between  <dig> and 10hz and a broad γ-band between  <dig> and 90hz, as well as manually determined frequency bands corresponding to the  <dig> hz and  <dig> hz γ-band peaks wherever present. for each frequency band, we compared average lfp psd for bf stimulation to a control condition recorded immediately prior to stimulation. for the low frequency band we found significant reductions in 3/ <dig> experiments , whereas effects were highly variable in the remaining experiments with both increases as well as decreases . as expected from the stimulation electrode placement, psd averaged across the entire γ-band exhibited significant increases following bf stimulation for all of the experiments , as shown in figure 5b. neither low frequency nor broad γ-band changes appeared to vary by layer . examining the γ-band peaks, we found that  <dig> hz and  <dig> hz peaks occurred in  <dig> and  <dig> experiments and during a total of 20/ <dig>  and 31/ <dig>  stimulation blocks respectively . to relate the spectral v <dig> lfp changes to bf anatomy, we plotted the location of the bf stimulation electrode in a horizontal projection for each animal, including positions within the nbm as well as adjacent structures . based on histological verification of each recording site, three stimulation sites fell within the nbm, while the remaining ones were in close proximity  <cit> ; medially in the nucleus fasciculi diagonalis brocae , laterally close to substantia inominata  and posteriorly close to nucleus centralis amygdalae . we note that γ-band peaks occurred only for sites located medially , encompassing both sites within as well as in close proximity to the nbm. consistent with this observation, the bf stimulation dependent effects on broad γ-band psd were negatively correlated with the medial/lateral position of the stimulation electrode .

finally, we wanted to relate the v <dig> lfp spectral changes to bf stimulation in the absence of visual input to contrast and orientation tuning parameters. we found no significant correlations between low or high frequency lfp spectral changes and bf stimulation related changes of any orientation related parameters tw, th and osi . for contrast response function related parameters, we did find a number of significant correlations: low frequency psd ratios were correlated with Δrmax , but not c <dig>  changes following bf stimulation, as shown in figure 6a,b. interestingly, the correlation between Δrmax and low frequency psd ratio was mainly due to the cases where robust increases in low frequency psd were seen following bf stimulation, and the correlation was no longer significant if these cases were removed from the population . psd ratios in the high frequency band were robustly correlated with both Δrmax  and Δc <dig> , as shown in figure 6c, d. there was no apparent difference in the rmax and c <dig> distributions between the sites that exhibited lfp spectral peaks at  <dig> and/or 70hz and those sites that did not. in addition, considering only sites that showed a  <dig> or 70hz peak, we found no correlation between the bf stimulation-dependent peak magnitude change and Δrmax  or Δc <dig> . thus, bf stimulation at sites that elicited a spectral lfp peak did not generally produce stronger rmax or c <dig> changes than sites with a broad γ-band increase. taken together, the magnitude of the γ-band psd change in the absence of visual input was the best predictor for contrast sensitivity increases in v <dig> mua, while being largely unrelated to v <dig> orientation selectivity.

discussion
we investigated how bf stimulation affected sensory representations by examining parameters related to the contrast response and orientation selectivity of v <dig> units. we observed strong increases in firing rates, a pronounced increase in contrast sensitivity and decreases in orientation selectivity.

since the bf, where we stimulated in the present study, contains a large population of cholinergic cortical projection neurons  <cit> , the results of bf stimulation thus might be thought to have been predictable based on the results of pharmacological application of ach or specific agonists of nachr and machr types in v <dig>  iontophoretic ach application has both excitatory and inhibitory effects on unit activity, with most studies reporting about twice as many increased compared to suppressed units  <cit> , but see  <cit> . selective stimulation of the nachr has been shown to elicit facilitation in a great majority of units, particularly in the granular input layer of cortex  <cit> . similarly, machr stimulation also tends to elicit facilitation, although these effects appear to occur in all cortical layers  <cit> . comparing our present findings to our previous data on iontophoretic cholinergic drug application in tree shrew v <dig> and taking the change in baseline-subtracted peak firing rate  as a measure of effect size for facilitation, we observed average values of +25%, +45% and +130% for machr, nachr and bf stimulation respectively. the Δrmax value following bf stimulation is thus greater than the sum of the increases due to the two cholinergic receptor types, although release profiles following iontophoretic drug application and bf stimulation may differ, complicating direct comparisons. nevertheless, it seems that cholinergic bf projections to the cortex are unlikely to be the only mechanism involved in the increase of cortical firing rates. a stronger case for non-cholinergic contributions following bf stimulation can be made concerning contrast sensitivity changes. to our knowledge, our findings in fact represent the first demonstration of a physiological intervention that reduces c <dig> values in the visual cortex and thus enhances the ability of neurons to detect low contrast stimuli. accordingly, c <dig> values are unaffected by ach application  <cit>  nachr  <cit>  or machr stimulation  <cit> , gaba-a blockade  <cit>  or alteration of parvalbumin-containing gabaergic interneuron activity  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that c <dig> values in the lgn are unaffected by both alertness levels and isoflurane anesthesia  <cit> . the lack of v <dig> c <dig> modulations in response to cholinergic pharmacological agents suggests that reductions in c <dig> values in response to bf stimulation cannot be accounted for by bf cholinergic projections alone.

it thus appears difficult to explain both the increased responsiveness of cortical neurons and the increased contrast sensitivity entirely based on bf cholinergic projections to cortex. there are two potential explanations for this finding, which are illustrated in figure  <dig>  a simplified schematic representation of the projections from the nbm of the bf to the cortex. the main cortical sites of cholinergic action are the machrs on pyramidal and gabaergic cells, and the nachrs on the presynaptic terminals of the thalamo-cortical projection neurons. activation of machrs can thus cause excitation in pyramidal cells directly  <cit> , or inhibit pyramidal cell activity by activating parvalbumin-containing gabaergic neurons  <cit> . activation of nachrs mainly enhances pyramidal cell activity by increasing glutamate release from thalamic terminals  <cit> . the gabaergic projections constitute another separate pathway by which bf activity can modulate cortical function  <cit> . these bf gabaergic projections preferentially contact somatostatin/calbindin containing gabaergic cortical interneurons  <cit> , but see  <cit> , and can thus cause elevated activity in pyramidal neurons by disinhibition. we suggest that this disinhibition is one candidate mechanism that might be responsible for the large  increases in activity we observed to bf stimulation in comparison to iontophoretic cholinergic receptor activation. during bf stimulation, the gabaergic bf neurons reduce activity in some cortical gabaergic interneurons, whereas activity of other gabaergic cortical interneurons is increased by cholinergic bf neurons via machr stimulation. consistent with this hypothesis, application of a gaba-a antagonist in cortex, which blocks inhibition on pyramidal neurons by both of the inhibitory pathways mentioned above, results in even stronger elevation of activity   <cit> . the reduced c <dig> value could also be due to disinhibition of cortical pyramidal neurons by this mechanism, suggesting that contrast sensitivity is controlled by neural circuits involving somatostatin/calbindin cortical interneurons, rather than parvalbumin containing interneurons or gabaergic circuits in general  <cit> . consistent with this hypothesis, a recent study has shown that optogenetic activation of v <dig> somatostatin neurons in fact significantly reduces v <dig> contrast sensitivity, thus leading to increased c <dig> values  <cit> . the second candidate mechanism involves the disinhibition of thalamic relay cells via projections of the bf to the reticular nucleus  <cit> . this is consistent with recent observations that bf stimulation increases activity of thalamic relay cells in the lgn  <cit> . an elevation in trial-to-trial reliability of neural responses was also observed in that study, which we suggest might have been a result of increased contrast sensitivity. after bf stimulation, units will respond to low contrast visual features of the movie stimulus that they were unresponsive to before, as well as responding more consistently across trials to intermediate contrast visual features. note that the effects on the lgn associated with bf stimulation may also be due to cortico-thalamic feedback from layer vi of cortex  <cit> .

cholinergic activation has been shown to have relatively weak effects on selectivity to stimulus features such as orientation and direction in v <dig>  with studies reporting moderate decreases  <cit>  as well as increases  <cit> . our own previous results in tree shrew v <dig> have suggested slight increases and decreases of orientation selectivity mediated by machrs and nachrs respectively  <cit> . generally consistent with previous findings, we report here unchanged tw, increased th and decreased osi values in response to bf stimulation. the relatively large decrease in osi values – despite the increase in tuning height and unchanged width – is a result of the large general increase in v <dig> firing rates, even for non-preferred orientations.

increase in broad γ-band activity in the cortex has been linked to bf activation  <cit> , and – in addition to reductions in low frequency activity – is used as a relevant aspect of the cortical spectrogram for the placement of bf stimulation electrodes  <cit> . here, we found that γ-band effects could take the form of broad-band increases, as well as displaying peaks with center frequencies around  <dig> hz and  <dig> hz. notably, dual peaks with similar center frequencies have been previously observed in visual cortical slice preparations during machr stimulation  <cit> . similarly, it has been shown that γ-band oscillations with a somewhat lower peak frequency of  <dig> hz can be evoked in the visual cortex in vivo by application of the cholinergic agonist carbachol  <cit> . this suggests that the γ-band peaks we observed in visual cortex following bf stimulation are likely to be a result of cholinergic bf projections to the cortex that target machrs, which in turn up-regulate perisomatic gabaergic inhibition. interestingly, we were able to elicit γ-band peaks only at medial bf sites within and close to the nb, whereas stimulation at more lateral bf sites did not elicit any peaks while nevertheless evoking increased broad γ-band activity. we speculate that medial stimulation sites might thus be more suitable for activating bf cholinergic projections to the cortex, possibly by targeting fibers of passage that initially take a medial course from the nbm, before projecting posteriorly  <cit> . our correlation analyses suggest that the γ-band peaks do not predict firing rate  or contrast sensitivity  increases following bf stimulation. instead, it is the broad γ-band activity which is correlated with both Δrmax and Δc <dig> values, suggesting that the overall strength of γ-power, rather than the appearance of specific peaks is related to the main effects on v <dig> unit activity. generally, γ-oscillations are thought to be generated by the interplay between local excitatory and inhibitory coupled networks  <cit> . it is therefore likely that, in addition to the cholinergic bf projections to the cortex, the two gabaergic pathways originating from the bf  also contribute to the increase of γ-band activity. this could be accomplished by shifting the balance between excitation and inhibition in cortex through an up-regulation of thalamo-cortical excitatory drive and the reduction of gabaergic inhibition onto cortical pyramidal cells, through the bf gabaergic projections to the reticular nucleus and cortex respectively. an involvement of gabaergic cortical projection pathways is consistent with modeling work suggesting that reduced drive to a set of cortical interneurons leads to γ-oscillations in a coupled network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons  <cit> . at the same time, the gabaergic projection to the reticular nucleus could also play a role, consistent with the recent demonstration that coupled inhibitory networks in conjunction with long range excitation can generate broad γ-band activity without ostensible spectral peaks  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our major finding is a strong increase in the contrast sensitivity of v <dig> neurons as well as a large increase in neural responsiveness following bf dbs. converging evidence suggests that these effects are unlikely to be due to the action of cholinergic mechanisms alone. we suggest that the action of gabaergic bf projection pathways is a candidate mechanism that could account for the observed findings, by causing disinhibition of v <dig> pyramidal neurons. this disinhibition may also contribute to the reduced stimulus selectivity we observed following bf stimulation, consistent with previous findings showing reduced stimulus selectivity in v <dig> as well as inferior temporal cortex following gaba receptor blockade  <cit> . given that these effects are likely to be detrimental for visual discrimination performance  <cit> , it is important to carefully consider the co-activation of gabaergic, in addition to cholinergic bf projections in clinical applications of bf stimulation.
