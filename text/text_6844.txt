BACKGROUND
endosomal compartments receive membrane bound cargo from both the biosynthetic and the endocytic pathways. receptor downregulation by endocytosis includes transport to early endosomes and either recycling or sorting into late endosomes. the latter have the morphological characteristics of multivesicular bodies   <cit>  that can undergo homotypic fusion or heterotypic fusion with lysosomes, which deliver mvb cargo for proteolytic degradation  <cit> . in addition to receptor downregulation, mvb formation has been implicated in antigen presentation  <cit>  and in the release of enveloped viruses  <cit> .

gene deletion and inactivation studies in yeast have identified  <dig> proteins that directly affect mvb formation  by resulting in aberrant endosomal/vacuolar morphology  <cit> . all proteins are required for vacuolar protein sorting  into the class e compartment and are recruited to endosomal membranes from the cytosol in order to assemble into three escrt  complexes that function in mvb formation  <cit> . receptor mono-ubiquitinylation has been shown to serve as a signal to enter the mvb pathway  <cit> . initial recognition of ubiquitinated cargo by vps <dig> recruits the ubiquitin binding protein vps <dig>  <cit> , which in turn leads to the assembly of the multi-protein complex escrt-i   <cit> . escrt-i subsequently recruits escrt-ii, composed of vps <dig>  vps <dig>  and vps <dig>  which in turn activates escrt-iii subcomplexes  <cit> . assembly of escrt-iii at the endosome initiates the sorting and concentration of ubiquitinated cargo; ubiquitin is removed and vps <dig>  an aaa-type atpase, dissociates the escrt complexes concomitantly with membrane invagination and budding of vesicles into the lumen of the endosome  <cit> .

two recent crystal structures of a core of the escrt-ii complex reveal a trilobal complex, containing two copies of vps <dig>  one copy of vps <dig> and the c-terminal region of vps <dig>  each subunit is composed of two winged helix domains and an n-terminal region of vps <dig> interacts with vps <dig> and vps <dig>  <cit> .

although escrt-ii is essential for the mvb pathway, since cells missing escrt-ii components fail to localize escrt-iii to late endosomes  <cit>  the complex has also been found "moonlighting" in the nucleus. the human and rat homologues of escrt-ii were originally identified as the eap complex , associated with the rna polymerase ii elongation factor ell in the nucleus  <cit> . consistent with a role in transcriptional control, yeast vps <dig>  as well as vps <dig> and vps <dig> have been implicated in glucose-dependent gene expression control  <cit> . to date, it is not clear whether the role of escrt-ii in mvb formation is independent of its function as a transcriptional activator or whether both processes are linked. here, we report the crystal structure of full-length yeast vps <dig>  composed of two homologous winged-helix domains.

RESULTS
structure of vps25
the structure of vps <dig> was solved by single wavelength anomalous diffraction  using selenomethionine-derivatized crystals. vps <dig> consists of two homologous winged helix domains as detected by the program grath  that are arranged in tandem . winged helix folds are compact alpha/beta structures with secondary structure elements arranged in a typical order   <cit> , which fold into a mostly helical part followed by a twisted anti-parallel beta-sheet and two large loops . the fold of vps <dig> deviates slightly from the canonical fold. the n-terminal domain  <dig>  contains two additional n-terminal 3/ <dig> helices, implicated in the interaction with either vps <dig> or vps <dig>  <cit> , followed by the canonical helix  <dig> and strand  <dig>  it lacks canonical helix  <dig>  which instead folds into a large disordered loop followed by strands  <dig> and  <dig> that connects to helix  <dig> . strands  <dig> and  <dig> then form, together with strand  <dig>  a twisted anti-parallel beta-sheet with wing w <dig> protruding from the structure . domain  <dig> also lacks wing w <dig>  as in the cases of winged helix domain containing transcription factors e2f <dig> and dp <dig>  <cit> . strand  <dig> flows directly into domain  <dig>  which also has a canonical winged helix fold except for the absence of wing w <dig> . domains  <dig> and  <dig> are tightly packed against each other and their c alpha atoms can be superimposed with an r.m.s. deviation of  <dig>  Å , confirming their structural relatedness. the domain interface is dominated by van der waals contacts including conserved and non conserved residues trp <dig>  phe <dig>  leu <dig>  leu <dig>  trp <dig> in domain  <dig> and leu <dig>  trp <dig>  met <dig>  pro <dig> and leu <dig> in domain  <dig> .

structural comparision of unliganded vps <dig> and vps <dig> in complex with vps <dig> and vps <dig> 
two recent crystal structures of the escrt-ii core reveal trilobal structures with head to tail interactions of one copy of vps <dig> with vps <dig> and the other copy of vps <dig> with vps <dig> at the center. in both cases a conserved proline rich n-terminal region of vps <dig>  together with conserved arg <dig> mediate key interactions  <cit> . therefore it was of interest to analyse whether vps <dig> undergoes any conformational changes upon participation in escrt-ii complex formation. superposition of the c alpha atoms with one copy of vps <dig> from either escrt-ii complex structure  revealed r. m. s. displacements of  <dig> / <dig>  Å ,  <dig> / <dig>  Å  and  <dig> / <dig>  Å  respectively. the major changes are confined to both wings w <dig> and w <dig> indicating their conformational flexibility . in contrast, the conserved n-terminal segment, which is implicated in vps <dig> and vps <dig> interactions shows no substantial changes .

in the unliganded vps <dig> structure, this helical segment constitutes the  <dig> Å <dig> dimerization interface of two identical vps <dig> dimers present in the asymmetric crystal unit. the dimer contact is mediated by hydrophobic residues pro <dig>  pro <dig>  val <dig>  phe <dig>  pro <dig>  and pro <dig>  which is similar to the contact region described for vps <dig> interactions with vps <dig> and vps <dig>  <cit> . in the vps <dig> structure arg <dig> does not participate in dimerization but hydrogen bonds to thr <dig> instead of forming salt bridges with either vps <dig> asp <dig> or vps <dig> asp <dig> as observed in the escrt-ii complex  <cit> . arg <dig> locates to a beta hairpin  in the unliganded form of vps <dig>  although the position of arg <dig> is unchanged in all vps <dig> structures  the position of the preceding loop region varies which might be due to differences in secondary structure assignment  <cit> . therefore vps <dig> seems to dock as a rigid body onto either vps <dig> or vps <dig> upon escrt-ii complex formation. although we do not detect vps <dig> dimer formation in vitro, a dimeric form of vps <dig> might be stabilized through other unknown interactions.

structural homology of vps <dig> with nucleic acid binding winged helix domains
analysis of the full-length structure with dali  <cit>  revealed seven structural homologues displaying nucleic acid binding winged helix domains with a z score above  <dig> for vps <dig> domain  <dig>  the top two hits were the selenocysteine-specific elongation factor fragment  and double-stranded rna specific adenosine deaminase  z-alpha domain . winged helix family members interact with nucleic acids mostly via the "specificity helix" that binds to the major groove of the dna with two flanking loops contributing to dna interactions  <cit> . superposition of vps <dig> domain  <dig> onto the winged helix domain of e2f- <dig> bound to dna  <cit>  matching the "specificity helices"  revealed a potential fit with only minor clashes at the helix h <dig> loop region . a potential nucleic acid interaction of vps <dig> might be interesting in light of the described role of vps <dig> and the other escrt-ii subunits in glucose-dependent gene regulation  <cit>  and complex formation with rna polymerase ii elongation factor ell  <cit> , although no biochemical data exist so far to support such a proposed function.

vps <dig> participates in protein complex formation
the escrt-ii complex assembles at the endosomal membrane downstream of escrt-i and recruits escrt-iii subcomplexes  <cit> . consistent with such a sequential assembly, further escrt-ii interactions of vps <dig> have been described, namely with vps <dig>  and with vps <dig>   <cit> . surface electrostatic potential maps of vps <dig> reveal a negatively charged surface within domain  <dig> that is characterized by a patch of conserved residues such as glu <dig>  glu <dig> and tyr <dig> . tyr <dig> is also part of the highly conserved domain  <dig>  helix  <dig> . domain  <dig> is the outer domain of vps <dig> in the escrt-ii complex and this region would thus be freely accessible for potential interaction with vps <dig> or vps <dig>  similarly, basic residues  potentially implicated in nucleic acid recognition are part of a conserved patch on domain  <dig> .

vps <dig> contains additional features, which are unique to s. cerevisiae, as evidenced from multiple sequence analysis  <cit> . vps <dig> orthologues have a shorter strand  <dig> to strand  <dig> connection , whose sequence is composed of mostly charged residues and is disordered in our structure as well as in the escrt-ii structures  <cit> . furthermore, domain  <dig> wing w <dig> is shorter  , which might indicate s. cerevisiae unique protein-protein interaction sites.

CONCLUSIONS
clear evidence suggests that escrt-ii recruitment is involved in mvb formation leading to plasma membrane receptor downregulation  <cit> . on the other hand escrt-ii seems to play a role in transcription regulation  <cit> . similarly, other escrt components such as tsg <dig>  and members of the chmp protein family  are also found to act in the nucleus as well as in the cytosol and at endosomal membranes  <cit> . interestingly, both vps <dig> and vps <dig> have been implicated in regulating stress and pheromone response pathways  <cit>  and pheromone receptor ste <dig> is downregulated via the endosomal pathway  <cit> . similarly, snf <dig> , vps <dig> and vps <dig> are all directly involved in derepression of glucose-repressed genes, which might be linked to sorting of sucrose receptors via the endosomal pathway  <cit> . protein sorting into mvb involves monoubiquitylation of cargo, which is recognized by escrt members. escrt-ii vps <dig> contains an ubiquitin binding nzf zinc finger motif that is necessary for protein sorting  <cit> . therefore, escrt-ii complexes may sense the turnover of specific ubiquitylated receptors at the endosomal membrane together with other unknown signals. as escrt-ii only transiently associates with endosomal membranes  <cit>  a signal within the mvb process might induce nuclear localization of escrt-ii, where it could stimulate gene expression leading to up or down regulation of specific membrane receptors.
