BACKGROUND
the coordination of various complex biological functions as well as the response to environmental and developmental stimuli are governed by biochemical processes that regulate gene activity. transcription is the initial step of gene expression and it involves a multitude of transcription factors , their corresponding cis-acting elements on dna, additional co-factors and the influence of chromatin structure  <cit> . functional tf binding sites  can be identified in the genome by computational approaches or experimentally by chromatin immunoprecipitation and hybridization on a genomic microarray   <cit>  or by high-throughput selection procedures  in which pools of random dna sequences are mixed with a tf and those that are preferentially bound are recovered and sequenced  <cit> . however, an alternative and very promising approach consists in combining in silico tfbs predictions in the gene promoter regions and microarray analyses, comparing gene expression of cells in which a tf is either over-expressed or deleted  <cit> . indeed, the analysis of regulatory sequences of putative co-regulated genes might be useful in identifying common cis-regulatory elements recognized by specific tfs  <cit> . the microarray assays help to narrow down the number of genes to be analyzed, focusing on those more likely to be regulated by the same tfs, thus reducing the false positive and negative rates.

the activator protein- <dig>  family of transcription factors includes five different yet closely related proteins known as tfap2a, tfap2b, tfap2c, tfap2d and tfap2e  <cit>  encoded by different genes. tfap <dig> can positively or negatively regulate the promoter activity of many pivotal genes involved in physiological or pathological processes such as development, cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and tumorigenesis  <cit> . among the positively regulated genes are: cdkn1a, tgfa, estrogen receptor, keratinocyte-specific genes, kit, hiv ktf <dig>  htlvi, type iv collagenase, sv <dig> enhancer region, human metallothionein gene iia, erbb <dig>  igfb <dig>  dopamine beta-hydroxylase. examples of repressed genes are: mcam, cebpa and myc  <cit> . the crucial role of the tfap <dig> genes in regulating fundamental biological processes is highlighted by the embryonic lethality of the genetically modified tcfap2a or tcfap2b or tcfap <dig> g mice  <cit> .

every tfap <dig> protein possesses a unique, highly conserved helix-span-helix dimerization motif at the c-terminal half of the protein, a central basic region and a less conserved proline- and glutamine-rich domain at the amino terminus  <cit> . the helix-span-helix motif and the basic region mediate dna binding and dimerization  <cit>  while the proline- and glutamine rich region is responsible for transcriptional transactivation. the tfap <dig> proteins are able to form hetero- as well as homo-dimers and bind to gc-rich dna sequences within regulatory regions of their target genes, mediating both activation and repression of gene transcription  <cit> . functional tfap <dig> binding sites, such as 5'-gccn3ggc-3' or 5'-gccn4ggc-3' or 5'-gccn3/4ggg-3' have been identified  <cit> . however other well characterized binding sites, such as 5'-ccccaggc-3'  <cit>  or others  <cit> , which differ considerably from the previous sequences, have also been found, indicating that tfap <dig> binding sites may represent promiscuous gc-rich elements varying considerably in binding affinity. this makes the computational identification of tfap <dig> binding sites not a trivial process. a positional frequency matrix  obtained by multiple alignment algorithms, which leads to nucleotide scores indexed by letters and positions is often used to localize degenerated cis-regulatory elements  <cit> . in addition, given that tfap <dig> isoforms are very similar in their dna binding domains, a specific sequence preference between different tfap <dig> proteins has not been found, as demonstrated by an in vitro binding site selection with recombinant tfap2a and tfap2c proteins  <cit> .

several molecular mechanisms control the tfap <dig> protein activity and physical interactions with other proteins play an important role. among the most important known tfap <dig> interacting proteins, we can list dna binding factors such as yy <dig>  <cit> ; yb <dig>  <cit> ; tp <dig>  <cit> ; sp <dig>  <cit> ; myc  <cit> ; pax <dig>  <cit> ; rb <dig>  <cit> ; cux <dig>  <cit> ; viral proteins such as sv <dig> large t antigen,  <dig> human t-cell leukemia virus type  <dig>  <cit>  and adenovirus e1a protein  <cit>  as well as non-dna-binding factors such as wwox  <cit> ; gas <dig>  <cit> ; parp <dig>  <cit> ; apc  <cit> ; creb  <cit> ; cited <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> ; pc <dig>  <cit> ; dek  <cit>  and yap  <cit> .

we previously performed whole-genome microarray analysis for hela cells either silenced for tfap2a by rna interference or not and identified a set of differentially expressed genes  <cit> . the regulatory regions  of the genes that unambiguously mapped to known ensembl ids were analyzed for the presence of tfap2a binding sites, employing the canonical positional weight matrix  reported in jaspar http://jaspar.genereg.net/.  <dig> genes containing at least  <dig> high score tfap2a binding sites were identified, several of which could be validated by chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays. additionally, a detailed analysis of the tfap2a-driven regulation of the discoidin, cub and lccl domain containing 2/endothelial and smooth muscle derived neuropilin like/cub, lccl-homology, coagulation factor v/viii homology domains  gene was performed. finally we searched for tfs that might cooperate with tfap2a in the transcriptional regulation of genes containing at least  <dig> high score tfap2a binding sites and found sp <dig> as a potential candidate for tfap2a activated genes.

RESULTS
identification of tfap2a binding sites in newly identified tfap2a-modulated genes
in order to define tfap2a binding sites in newly identified tfap2a-modulated genes  <cit>  we first assembled a dataset of core promoter regions  for all known human protein-coding genes  using the ensembl database and searched for tfap2a binding sites employing the canonical tfap2a positional weight matrix  ma <dig>  reported in the jaspar database. affinity scores were assigned using standard log-likelihood ratios  <cit>  and a binding site defined as an oligonucleotide with log-likelihood ratio higher than 66% of the maximum score possibly associated to the pwm. after ranking the binding sites by score, we used various thresholds  to classify the genes containing at least one or two high score tfap2a binding sites . in the following we will mostly consider the top-scoring 20% binding sites. we then focused on the set of the differentially expressed genes identified by microarray analysis  <cit> , in which gene expression profiles of hela cells, either silenced for tfap2a by rna interference or not were compared considering a fold change  > Â±  <dig>  and a p value  <  <dig> . for each of them the longest available transcript was chosen . significant enrichment for tfap2a binding sites was found in the regulatory regions of these genes compared with genome-wide abundance as calculated using an exact fisher test, as shown in table  <dig>  in the whole genome the genes containing at least one or two high score tfap2a binding sites were respectively  <dig> and  <dig> whereas, among tfap2a-regulated genes,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes  contained at least one high score tfap2a binding site while  <dig> out of  <dig>  genes  contained a minimum of two sites indicating an enrichment for tfap2a binding sites in the tfap2a-regulated genes , see table  <dig>  the results for different thresholds  were similarly significant and shown in table  <dig>  we ranked the genes according to the number of tfap2a binding sites present in their core promoter regions  and found that the majority of the genes contained one or two tfap2a binding site/s. it's important to underline that already reported tfap2a target genes were identified in our analysis .

functional classes enrichment for predicted tfap2a target genes
to identify the functional pathways in which the potential tfap2a targets could be involved gene ontology  and network analyses were performed for the  <dig> tfap2a-modulated genes containing at least two tfap2a high score binding sites using the ingenuity pathway analysis systems. two high score molecular networks were identified and in figure 2a and 2b we show a selection of these genes and their connections with tfap2a. the first network associated with cellular movement  and included  <dig> genes, i.e. slit <dig> ; pdgfa ; rac <dig> and rac <dig> ; dcbld2/esdn ; acta <dig> . the second network associated with cellular development  and included  <dig> genes, i.e. pparg ; mapk <dig> ; cxcl <dig> ; adamts <dig> ; areg ; il <dig> .

functional validation of potential tfap2a-regulated genes
potential tfap2a binding was tested for  <dig> candidate target genes containing at least one or two best 20% tfap2a binding sites by chromatin immuno precipitation  assay : adamts <dig> ; casp <dig> ; cd <dig> ; cxcl <dig> ; ereg ; dcbld2/esdn ; fastk ; glo <dig> ; krt <dig> ; krt <dig> ; pparg ; slit <dig> ; tgfbi . the ensembl id, microarray fold change  and tfap2a binding sequences, scores and positions for each of these genes is shown in table  <dig>  chip analysis was performed on hela cells, that endogenously express tfap2a and as shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  enrichment for tfap2a was found on the promoter of each gene compared with negative controls, suggesting in vivo binding and direct regulation of these genes by tfap2a. negative controls for chip analysis were performed using genes in which low score or no tfap2a binding sites were identified such as plcxd <dig>  or ifi <dig> . in fact, no enrichment for tfap2a was observed in the promoter of these two genes compared with the negative igg controls suggesting that genes containing only low score or no tfap2a binding sites are not direct tfap2a targets and their tfap2a-dependent modulation is indirect. chip analysis for pparg and plcxd <dig> genes was also performed in hepg <dig> cells that do not express tfap2a and no enrichment for tfap2a was observed for any of the analyzed sequences supporting the significance of the results obtained in hela cells .

the dcbld2/esdn/clcp <dig> promoter region is directly regulated by tfap2a
dcbld2/esdn/clcp <dig>  turned out to be the most highly modulated  gene in our microarray analysis on hela cells  and to have an important role in cell migration  <cit> . for these reasons we carried on a detailed computational analysis of the dcbld2/esdn regulatory region, extended to , and found high enrichment of gc content and no tata box around the tss, features which are common to the core promoters of tfap2a targets identified with our computational analysis. this sequence was analyzed to position potential tfap2a binding sites using the canonical tfap2a positional weight matrix  as in jaspar database . three highly scored tfap2a binding sites were identified in the region -360/+ <dig>  a schematic representation of the  <dig>  kb dcbld2/esdn promoter is shown in figure 4a. this region was amplified from a bac genomic clone  and cloned in a luciferase reporter vector generating the pgl3-esdn-wt  construct. the effects of tfap2a on promoter activity were tested by performing reporter assays in hela and mda-mb- <dig> cell lines expressing, respectively, medium and low levels of tfap2a as assessed by western blot  analyses shown in figure 4b and 4c. both cell lines were transiently co-transfected with either esdnwt or its 5' deletant pgl3-esdn-del <dig>  starting at - <dig> or pgl3-basic  control reporter vector and an expression plasmid for tfap2a, psptfap2a  or its control empty vector  . alternatively hela cells  were transfected with an expression vector for tfap2a silencing, psuper-tfap2ashrna <dig> , or with the empty psuper control vector . in addition, cells were transfected with the prltk vector for renilla luciferase expression, to perform transfection efficiency normalization. tfap2a basal levels, overexpression or silencing were verified by western blot  analyses  where glyceraldheyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  was used as loading control.  <dig> fold higher activity was observed for the esdnwt reporter vector in mda-mb- <dig> cells compared with hela cells . the inhibitory function of tfap2a on dcbld2/esdn gene transcription was further supported when hela and mda-mb- <dig> cells were co-transfected with esdnwt and tfap2a  with respectively  <dig> and  <dig>  fold reduction in luciferase activity . this reduction was inversely proportional to the tfap2a levels in cells , as shown in figure 4c for mda-mb- <dig> cells. instead, tfap2a silencing in hela cells caused a  <dig>  fold increase in reporter activity . all together these results strongly suggest a direct repressive activity of tfap2a on dcbld2/esdn promoter and are in agreement with our previous microarray results  <cit> .

specific role of the tfap2a binding sites present in dcbld2/esdn promoter
a detailed functional analysis was performed for the main tfap2a binding site present in dcbld2/esdn promoter by carrying out site-directed mutagenesis to obtain  <dig> bp deletions in the central portion of each tfap2a binding site in single or multiple combinations to generate the constructs reported in figure  <dig>  mutations in the tfap2a binding sites  <dig> or  <dig> or  <dig>  produced statistically significant increased promoter activity just like mutations for multiple tfap2a binding sites  <dig>  or  <dig> , or  <dig>  or  <dig> , <dig>  as indicated by the student's t tests: * pv <  <dig> ; ** pv <  <dig>  suggesting that each binding site plays a role in repressing the promoter activity.

identification of transcription factor binding sites  present in the promoter regions of tfap2a-regulated genes by over-represented dna oligonucleotides or opossum or meme analysis
the properties of the core promoter region sequences of the  <dig> best 20% tfap2a-regulated genes were studied by using three different approaches based on different biological assumptions and statistical filters such as: 1) short over-represented oligonucleotides; 2) opossum; 3) meme.

 <dig>  over-represented oligonucleotides
we performed a genome-wide characterization of the previously described core promoters of human-protein-coding genes, working on the statistical properties of short  dna oligonucleotides  present in these sequences. in particular, we identified sets of genes sharing over-represented oligos in their promoter regions according to a binomial model . we then characterized the evolutionary properties of these oligos using a "conserved over-representation" approach, an alignment-free methodology applied to human-mouse comparison  <cit> . the resulting different sets of genes were then compared with the up- and down- tfap2a-regulated gene datasets, described above and the enrichment for oligos in tfap2a-regulated genes was assessed in the different sets of genes using an exact fisher test  as shown in table  <dig>  results were ranked according to the corresponding pv and the top  <dig> over-represented oligos are shown in table  <dig>  for some of these oligos the over-representation is conserved  suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for them. when possible, a known tfbs consensus was then associated to each oligo, using the list of transfac tfbs consensus sequences reported in  <cit> . interestingly, as shown in table  <dig>  some of the most over-represented oligos found for the tfap2a-down-regulated genes correspond to the sp <dig> consensus sequence . for the up-regulated genes we found many over-represented oligos but we were not able to link them to any known tf.

for each tf its consensus binding site sequence, abbreviated name, number of target genes and statistical enrichment values  are reported. * conserved over-represented oligo

 <dig>  opossum
opossum  <cit>  is able to evaluate the over-representation of known tfbs on human/mouse conserved regions. we used this tool to analyze the sets of tfap2a-regulated genes setting the parameters indicated in methods. results are reported in table  <dig> for the up- and down-regulated genes separately. a strong enrichment was observed for sp <dig>  and nhlh <dig>  on down-regulated genes. an enrichment for pax <dig>  and cebpa  was observed for the up-regulated genes even if the statistical relevance was weaker then what observed for the down-regulated genes.

for each tf its positional weight matrix  numbers, abbreviated name, number of target genes and statistical enrichment values  are reported.

 <dig>  meme
meme is a software for the ab-initio identification of relevant motifs in a given set of sequences in which a motif is a sequence pattern that occurs repeatedly in a group of related dna sequences  <cit> . the parameters used in our analysis are indicated in methods and the results obtained are reported in table 6: meme regular expression motifs and the relative e-values for the most interesting motifs are indicated. meme results are not directly associated to known tfbss and to investigate whether the resulting motifs could be recognized as known tfbss the same approach used previously for the oligo analysis was used here  <cit> . for this identification, perfect match between meme regular expression and the iupac equivalent was required, as shown in table  <dig>  and association between motifs and known tfs was found in some cases. enrichment for sp <dig> was also found with this method, in particular for down-regulated genes .

for each tf its consensus binding site sequence, abbreviated name, number of target genes and statistical enrichment values  are reported.

positioning of the sp <dig> binding sites in the promoter regions of tfap2a-down-regulated genes and functional validation
after having observed an enrichment for sp <dig> binding sites in the  <dig> tfap2a-down-regulated genes with the three methods mentioned above, we searched for sp <dig> sites in the promoter regions of these genes using the same approach employed to recognize tfap2a binding sites: jaspar, sp <dig> positional weight matrix ma <dig>  cut off on the best 20% score.  <dig> genes containing at least one sp <dig> binding sites were identified and are listed in table  <dig>  in the same table it is also indicated if these sp <dig> motifs were identified with the over-represented oligo or opossum or meme approach or not. sp <dig> binding sites were found in:  <dig> common genes identified with the oligo analysis and meme;  <dig> genes common to oligo analysis and opossum;  <dig> genes common to meme and opossum; the only common gene to the triple intersection was olfml2a. it is important to underline that sp <dig> sites did not overlap with tfap2a binding motifs .

a search for sp <dig> transcription factor binding sites  was performed on the promoter regions  of  <dig> tfap2a-down-modulated genes  <cit> , mapped in ensembl, containing at least one or two best 20% tfap2a binding sites  using the sp <dig> positional weight matrix  provided by jaspar.  <dig> genes containing sp <dig> tfbs were identified. the outcome obtained with the oligo, opossum and meme analyses are also indicated .

potential sp <dig> binding was tested for  <dig> candidate target genes containing one or two best 20% sp <dig> and tfap2a binding sites by chromatin immuno precipitation  assay, as indicated by jaspar pwms. see figure  <dig>  the  <dig> candidate genes were casp <dig> ; krt <dig> ; krt <dig>  and tgfbi . chip analysis was performed on hela cells, using specific anti-sp <dig> and tfap2a antibody. as shown in figure  <dig>  enrichment for sp <dig> together with tfap2a was found on the promoter of each gene compared with negative controls, suggesting a functional role for both cis-elements. negative controls for chip analysis were performed using genes where no high score binding sites for either sp <dig> or tfap2a were identified such as adamts <dig>  and plcxd <dig> . enrichment for tfap2a but not for sp <dig> was found for adamts <dig> while no enrichment for both tfs was observed for plcxd <dig> 

discussion
the results presented in this work show how powerful an in silico approach can be for the identification of functional transcription factor binding sites , in particular when computational investigations are associated with microarray analysis. in fact, while microarray analysis is, by definition, not able to discriminate between direct or indirect transcription factor  gene expression modulation  <cit> , the positioning of tfbss on differentially expressed genes allows the identification of genes directly regulated by the tf of interest. by analyzing gene expression profiles on hela cells either silenced for tfap2a by rna interference or not  <cit>  we were previously able to identify a subset of new tfap2a regulated genes on which it was possible to position high score tfap2a binding sites and find an enrichment of sites compared with genome-wide  <cit> . the strength of our computational approach was consolidated by experimental validations revealing tfap2a binding to the high score tfap2a sites identified but not to portions of dna without tfap2a binding sequences or containing only low score sites.

a network analysis performed with ingenuity pathway analysis systems for the tfap2a-modulated genes containing at least two high score tfap2a binding sites revealed "cellular movement" and "cellular development" as the main networks confirming results previously obtained in our and other laboratories. in fact, many reports demonstrated that tfap2a plays a major role in development  <cit>  and we recently showed a function for tfap2a in cell migration and/or invasion for tumor cells  <cit>  and neurons  <cit> . genes involved in both biological processes were previously identified however several new ones have been discovered here. among the already known genes, pparg, mapk <dig>  and vegf  <cit>  are present in the networks confirming the validity of our analysis.

the "cellular movement" network includes genes with specific biological functions and some examples are listed here. slit <dig>  is involved in induction of negative chemotaxis in neuronal cells, glial cell migration, motor axon guidance and nervous system development  <cit> . pdgfs  are known to regulate cell proliferation as well as migration for mesenchymal or endothelial cells  <cit> . interestingly, in vascular cells pdgfbb is known to up-regulate dcbld2/esdn , the most tfap2a-modulated gene in our microarray analysis. pdgfbb is also known to be related to another tfap2a-modulated gene, acta <dig> , which codes for a protein belonging to the actin family that plays a role in cell motility, structure and integrity and regulates blood pressure via vascular and smooth muscle contraction  <cit> . rac <dig> and rac <dig>  are small gtpases belonging to the ras superfamily and regulate a variety of cellular events, including growth control, cytoskeletal reorganization and protein kinase activation  <cit> . pdgf and rac <dig> are connected with each other since it was demonstrated that all rac1-related gtpases expressed in mouse primary fibroblasts, cdc <dig>  rac <dig>  and rhog, are required for efficient migration following pdgf stimulation  <cit> .

some of the genes included in cellular development network are: ppars  form heterodimers with retinoid x receptors  and regulate the transcription of various genes. three subtypes of ppars are known: ppara, ppard and pparg. the last one regulates adipocyte differentiation and is involved in the pathology of numerous diseases including obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis and cancer  <cit> . mapk <dig>  is a member of the map kinase family and it is involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation and development  <cit> . cxcl <dig>  belongs to the chemokine family, a group of small, structurally related molecules that regulate cell trafficking of various types of leukocytes via the interaction with a subset of 7-transmembrane, g protein-coupled receptors  <cit> . in addition, cxcl <dig> is known to play a major role in inflammation, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis and wound healing  <cit> . adamts <dig>  gene encodes for a member of the adamts protein family that has anti-angiogenic activity and the expression of this gene may be associated with various inflammatory processes as well as development of cancer and cachexia  <cit> . the protein encoded by the areg  gene is a member of the epidermal growth factor  family involved in cell growth stimulation of astrocytes, schwann cells, fibroblasts and epithelial cells by interacting with egf receptor  <cit> . il <dig>  encodes for a cytokine which stimulates the t-cell-dependent development of immunoglobulin-producing b cells and potentiates proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocyte progenitors  <cit> .

since it is well known that tfap2a cooperates with other transcription factors  to regulate transcription, three different methods, over-represented oligonucleotides, opossum and meme, were used to identify tf which could possibly work in cooperation with tfap2a to regulate the  <dig> genes containing the best score tfap2a binding sites. remarkably a common enrichment for sp <dig> binding sites was found in genes containing at least one or two high score tfap2a binding sites and transcriptionally activated by tfap2a but not in the repressed ones. sp <dig> is known to cooperate with tfap2a in transcription  <cit> , however here we underline the importance of sp <dig> specifically in tfap2a gene activation, but not in transcriptional repression and localize sp <dig> binding sites to dna nucleotide sequences distinct from tfap2a binding sites, although, from our experiments, we cannot exclude the possible physical interaction between tfap2a and sp <dig> 

among the chip validated genes, the gene encoding for discoidin, cub and lccl domain containing 2/endothelial and smooth muscle derived neuropilin like  resulted the most modulated in our microarray analysis with a . this is one of the reasons why we decided to investigate its tfap2a-dependent transcription in detail together with its interesting functions. its protein structure resembles that of neuropilins, transmembrane proteins which are promiscuous for ligands and co-receptors. dcbld2/esdn is ubiquitously expressed but linked to metastasis formation since it has been cloned and found to be significantly up-regulated from highly metastatic lung cancer cells  <cit> . various functional studies link dcbld2/esdn to tumor progression but a specific role in tumor promotion or repression has not been defined yet  <cit> . dcbld2/esdn expression was analyzed in our  and other laboratories  <cit>  in melanoma and breast cell lines and found to be expressed only in highly metastatic cells but not in their related poorly malignant variants suggesting a positive role for dcbld2/esdn in tumor progression. dcbld2/esdn was also shown to be part of an invasive breast cancer gene signature  <cit> . however in hela cells, used for our microarray analysis, we demonstrated that tfap2a regulates tumor cell motility and invasion, at least partially, via dcbld2/esdn in a negative manner  <cit> . here tfap2a down-modulation prompted dcbld2/esdn up-regulation, suggesting a possible direct repressive effect of dcbld2/esdn transcription by tfap2a. in our present investigation, overexpression of tfap2a in cells expressing low or high levels of tfap2a, respectively mda-md- <dig> and hela cells, led to decreased dcbld2/esdn promoter activity although in mda-mb- <dig> cells dcbld2/esdn promoter activity was higher in comparison with hela cells. accordingly tfap2a silencing induced higher dcbld2/esdn promoter activity. importantly, the negative effect of tfap2a on dcbld2/esdn promoter was dose-dependent since when mda-mb- <dig> cells were transfected with increasing levels of the tfap2a-expression vector, a proportional down-regulation of transcription was observed. all together, these findings strongly suggest a direct repressive activity of tfap2a on dcbld2/esdn promoter and are in agreement with our microarray results  <cit> . for these reasons we made the hypothesis that if tfap2a represses dcbld2/esdn transcription, inverse expression profiles should exist for the two genes and therefore we used an on-line expression atlas for rna expressions in tumors http://biogps.gnf.org. in some case high dcbld2/esdn expression coincided with very low levels of tfap2a in tumor cells, while in other cases dcbld2/esdn high or low expression co-existed with high tfap2a expression. in addition, for many tumors both genes showed comparable tfap2a low or medium rna levels. since it is known that tfap <dig> activity can be modulated by a wide range of interacting proteins  <cit> , it is conceivable that differential expression and functional roles of tfap2a co-factors may account for distinct effects on dcbld2/esdn gene transcription. moreover, the presence of other tfap <dig> isoforms and the relative ratios with one another may be crucial here. on the other hand, in many cases, both tfap2a and dcbld2/esdn genes might not be expressed. finally, it is important to keep in mind that rna levels do not always correspond to actual protein levels or activity. for instance, tfap <dig> proteins are known to be modified post-translationally by phosphorylation, sumoylation and redox status, which may affect their activity and cellular localization  <cit> .

three high and several low score tfap2a binding sites were identified in the promoter region of the dcbld2/esdn gene by computational analysis however we only investigated the functional role and contribution of the main tfap2a binding sequences. by doing so we observed that each tfap2a site was essential for repression of dcbld2/esdn transcription, in fact the inactivation of one or two or three site/s equally affected promoter activity in luciferase assays. these experimental validations, confirm once again, that our computational analyses represent a powerful tool for the identification of tf regulatory targets by predicting precisely their cis-elements  <cit> . to better understand the repressive effect of tfap2a on dcbld2/esdn transcription, the interaction of tfap2a with other co-factors will be studied in the future. a better comprehension of the tfap2a-driven regulation of the dcbld2/esdn gene should provide novel and useful insights on mechanisms of tumor progression and metastasis formation.

CONCLUSIONS
our study was essential for: 1) identifying functional tfap2a binding sites in novel tfap2a-regulated genes; 2) defining "cellular movement" and "cellular development" as the main networks in which the tfap2a target genes are involved; 3) associate sp <dig> to tfap2a gene transcription activation but not repression; 4) dissecting the tfap2a-driven regulation of dcbld2/esdn, an important player of tumor progression.
