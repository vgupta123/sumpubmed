BACKGROUND
recent studies revealed that a high fraction of proteins in eukaryotes have long stretches of intrinsically disordered  regions  <cit> . proteins with id regions, abundant in the cytosol and nucleus but scarce in mitochondria  <cit> , are frequently involved in cellular regulatory processes such as transcription, translation, and cellular signaling transduction  <cit> . the abundance of proteins with id regions in the cells can be tightly controlled by regulation of transcript clearance, proteolytic degradation, and translational rate <cit> . transcription factors  such as activators, repressors, or enhancer-biding factors may be considered typical, as most of them contain long stretches of id regions  <cit> . while human tfs are characterized by a dna-binding domain  and other structural domains, 60% of them are composed only of a dbd and id regions  <cit> . intriguingly some id regions in tfs harbor functional sites called transactivation domains , which interact with coactivators and other factors of the pre-initiation complex to transmit the activation signal to rna polymerase. in vitro experimental studies, particularly those with nmr spectroscopy, revealed that tads of various tfs are unstructured in isolation, but become structured upon binding to their interaction partners  <cit> . prokaryotic tfs differ from eukaryotic tfs in that they generally do not have long id regions; dbd and/or other structural domains occupy nearly the entire lengths <cit> . the molecular architecture composed of structural domains and id regions is generally found in eukaryotic proteins, including membrane proteins  <cit> . highly sensitive homology search tools, such as psi-blast  <cit>  and hmmer  <cit> , made it possible to identify and locate structural domains along a protein sequence with high confidence  <cit> , if at least one homolog had its 3d structure experimentally determined. according to the general view above, the regions of the protein to which no known structure has been assigned should correspond either to id regions or to domains of unknown structure, which we hereafter call "cryptic" structural domains. thus, if id regions can be accurately distinguished from cryptic domains, the entire length of any protein can be classified into structural domains and id regions.

efficient computer programs have been developed for prediction of id regions from protein sequences  <cit>  and utilized in genome-wide surveys  <cit> . all of these prediction methods are based on the fact that id regions have a characteristic skewed amino acid composition; hydrophilic and charged residues are abundant, while hydrophobic residues are scarce  <cit> . in the previous study  <cit> , we employed the profile-based disorder prediction program, disopred <dig>  <cit> , together with a domain identification method. in  <dig> human tfs, the residue-wise fractions of structural domains and id regions were found to be 31% and 49%, respectively, with the remaining 20% left unclassified. as some of the unclassified regions were long, they can possibly contain new structural domains <cit> . others showed mosaic patterns consisting of short id and unclassified regions.

besides the skewed amino acid composition, id regions are characterized by higher sequence divergence as compared to structural domains. it is known that structural domains are well conserved through evolution and can be detected by homology search methods even across different kingdoms   <cit> . sequence conservation has been used as a factor to discriminate structural domains from domain-linkers  <cit> . by contrast the sequences of id regions generally mutate more rapidly than structural regions, although some exceptions were found  <cit> . presumably because id regions are not structurally constrained  <cit> , frequent indels , un-aligned sites, and amino acid substitutions occur in id sequences. it is common that blast searches using human proteins as queries detect homology in id regions in mammalian proteins, but in a very small number of invertebrate proteins, and in none of the other more remote species, although homology in structural domains is generally detectable beyond invertebrates.

in the present study, we developed a program to classify disorder regions and structural domains, cladist, incorporating information of un-aligned sites into amino acid composition. we developed a combined system that uses structural domain identification, disorder prediction, and the cladist program to make order/disorder assignments to the entire length of proteins. we found that our system, dichot, divides proteins into structural domains and id regions highly accurately. application of the system to human tfs identifies id regions and structural domains, including a number of cryptic structural domains.

RESULTS
utilization of sequence conservation in structure/disorder classification
we thus developed the cladist program that uses the amino acid composition considering information of highly divergent sequences in id regions to divide the entire proteins into structural domains and id regions. the program treats alignment gaps and un-aligned regions as the 21st element of amino acid composition and uses support vector machine for classification .

we tested the accuracy of the cladist program in classifying proteins into structural domains and id regions. cladist was applied to a set of  <dig> proteins with experimentally verified id regions selected from the disprot database  <cit>  . table  <dig> shows benchmark tests performed in 4-fold validation test. in test  <dig>  all blast homologues with e-value less than 10- <dig> were used for estimation of the local amino acid composition.  <dig> % of the residues were correctly assigned to either structural domains or id regions. in order to examine the cases in which only close homologues of a query are available, we only took blast homologues with e-value less than 10- <dig> to perform test  <dig>  in this test, the percentage of correctly assigned residues dropped to  <dig> % . this test simulates cases of lineage-specific proteins, with only closely related homologues whose entire lengths including id regions are aligned by blast. in such cases, sequence divergence cannot be effectively utilized for classification, leaving the local amino acid composition  as the sole factor to rely on. in other words, the factor of sequence divergence with incorporation of alignment gaps increases the accuracy by more than 6%.

the dichot system
from the result above, we reasoned that combining accurate structural domain assignment by profile methods, disopred <dig> prediction, and the cladist classification program could lead to a complete assignment of protein molecules into structural domains and id regions with high accuracy . we built the dichot system by giving the first priority to trans-membrane  domains and structural domains assigned by alignments to pdb sequences, then to id regions predicted by disopred <dig>  and finally to both structural domains and id regions assigned by cladist. in four steps, dichot classifies the entire sequence of a query into structural domains and id regions. structural domains consist of "known domains", i.e., structural domains with similarity to known 3d structures, and "cryptic domains" signifying structural domains without similarity to known 3d structures.

a flow chart of the dichot system is presented in figure  <dig> together with region assignment steps of a hypothetical protein, in which the tentative status after each step is shown in the status box. in the first step, a homology search against the pdb sequences , trans-membrane  assignments, disopred <dig> prediction, and cladist prediction are carried out. the assignment of known domains is firstly carried out in step  <dig> . the id regions predicted by disopred <dig> and cladist are also accepted, when they lie outside of the known domains . dichot employs length cutoffs for known and cryptic domains. the hatched boxes in step  <dig> are regions that fall below the length cutoffs, and are assessed by referring to the sd search and cladist results in steps  <dig> and  <dig>  in this case, the left-most hatched box is classified as a cryptic domain, because it lies outside of any of the known domains, while the other two hatched boxes are not so classified because they are judged unqualified in step  <dig> . any query sequence is thereby entirely classified into two categories, structural domains consisting of known and cryptic domains, and id regions .

application of the dichot system to the above-mentioned test data showed that the accuracy increases to  <dig> % . the increase of accuracy can be attributed to the following two factors. first, prediction error in structural domains can be reduced by the accurate domain assignments by the homology searches against pdb, which are not included in cladist but in dichot. second, prediction error in id regions can be reduced by taking the intersection of the id regions obtained by cladist and disopred <dig>  therefore the combined system was effective in improving the reliability of assignments. if used alone, cladist misclassifies some residues in structural domains into id regions. on the other hand the dichot system gives highly accurate structural domain assignments with the employment of profile methods, resulting in the increase in accuracy.

application of dichot to human transcription factors
the dichot system was applied to a set of  <dig> human tfs to classify each protein into structural domains and id regions. out of a total of  <dig>  residues,  <dig> % were classified as known structural domains,  <dig> % as cryptic structural domains, and  <dig> % as id regions . compared to the previous results , the fractions of structural domains and id regions both increased significantly. the fractional increase in known structural domains  is attributable to the increase in 3d structural data in pdb over the previous study. for comparison, dichot was also applied to  <dig> tfs from e. coli :  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the residues fell on known structural domains, cryptic structural domains, and id regions, respectively. there is a clear difference between human and e. coli tfs: unlike human tfs, e. coli tfs consist almost entirely of structural domains, with a small fraction of id regions corresponding to relatively short linkers connecting structural domains and/or terminal tails.

cryptic structural domains were found in  <dig> human tfs . although the 3d structures of cryptic structural domains remain undetermined and cannot be inferred by homology search methods, functional roles have been experimentally assigned to some of them. figure  <dig> shows two examples of such cases.

a cryptic structural domain predicted in the mhc class ii regulatory factor, rfx <dig> , has been found to mediate dimerization and transcriptional repression  <cit> . human rfx <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> that bind dna as homo- or hetero-dimeric complexes possess highly conserved b-c-d regions, to which the domain responsible for dimerization has been mapped  <cit> .

the four cryptic structural domains at the c-terminus of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1a, srebp-1a, correspond to the regulatory domain  <cit>  as a whole . we cannot determine the exact number of structural domains, because the dichot system is not accurate enough to definitively delimit cryptic structural domains. srebp-1a has two transmembrane helices in the middle  and has both the n- and c-terminal regions in the cytoplasm. upon binding of the c-terminal regulatory domain to srebp-cleavage activating protein , the n-terminal side of the protein is known to be cleaved off by specific proteases and be transported to the nucleus to act as a transcription activator  <cit> .

all the results of the present study obtained by the dichot system can be retrieved at .

comparison with the previous study
hypoxia inducible factor 1Î±  is composed of dbd , two pas domains, an oxygen-dependent degradation domain , and two tads termed n-tad and c-tad . although c-tad was considered to be a structural domain in the previous study because it becomes structured upon binding to the partner protein, an nmr study has revealed that the c-tad fragment is unstructured in the unbound state  <cit> . thus, the region should be classified as predicted in the present study. similarly, n-tad and odd, both of which are unstructured unless bound to their partner proteins  <cit> , should be classified as id regions, as correctly done in this study.

discussion
a natural first step in analyzing the molecular architecture of proteins with id regions is an accurate classification into structural domains and id regions. for the dichotomic purpose, we have developed the dichot system, which combines existing methods of domain identification and disorder prediction with cladist, a newly developed classification program. the most reliable among the components is the identification methods that, along the sequence of a query protein, locate structural domains homologous to data compiled in scop and/or pdb. dichot identifies known domains by this method first and divides the remainder into structural domains and id regions by a combination of the disopred <dig> and cladist programs. the resolving power largely depends on the number of homologues available. the cladist program, in which the effect of sequence conservation is incorporated through local amino acid composition, maintains high accuracy even in cases in which only a limited number of homologues are available .

the application of dichot to tfs has revealed that the fraction of structural domains is only 38% in human tfs, while that in e. coli tfs is as high as 95% . at the same time, dichot uncovered cryptic structural domains in 4% and 12% of the residues of human and e. coli tfs, respectively . we believe that the cryptic structural domains serve as good targets of structural genomics research. the smaller fraction of cryptic structural domains in human tfs than in e. coli tfs may reflect the more experimental research carried out on the former than the latter. rapid increase of structural data in the pdb is expected to convert cryptic structural domains into known structural domains. in fact, besides rfx <dig> and srbp-1a in figure  <dig>  transcription factor e2f <dig> was regarded as a good example of a structural domain whose structure had not been determined but with known function in the previous study  <cit> , but the domain was assigned as a known structural domain in the present study, because the x-ray structure of the dimerization domain of e2f- <dig> had been solved in the meantime  <cit> . this conversion applies not only to e2f- <dig>  but also to all members of the human e2f family <cit> : e2f1- <dig> and dp <dig>   <dig>  that the fraction of cryptic structural domains detected in this study was rather small indicates that the 3d structures already available include a high fraction of naturally occurring protein folds.

cryptic structural domains were sometimes supported by the presence of pfam domains in the same regions. however, we chose not to utilize pfam for detection of structural domains, because some pfam domains exist within id regions  <cit> . for instance, the pfam domain, pf <dig>  resides within the n-terminal side of the androgen receptor , which is unstructured when not bound to the cognate protein as observed by spectroscopic measurements  <cit> . this happens presumably because a pfam domain is defined for a sequence pattern conserved within a number of proteins, irrespective of the presence or absence of a globular structure  <cit> . it may apparently look contradictory that a pfam domain is assigned to the n-terminal part of androgen receptor due to high sequence conservation on one hand, while on the other hand an id region was assigned to the same region by our system due to high sequence divergence. however, there is no inconsistency because the n-terminal sequence is conserved only within homologues of phylogenetically close species as mentioned before, while the c-terminal sequence is conserved over more remote homologues , and the poorer sequence conservation relative to the c-terminus is symptomatic of the existence of an id region at the n-terminus.

distinction of whether or not a globular structure is formed is crucial in the classification of the region into a structural domain or an id region. protein-protein interaction sites including tads, located in the middle of long stretches of id regions, are unstructured in the isolated state, even though they transiently adopt fixed configurations in complex with partner proteins. in this sense, they are regarded as intrinsically unstructured  <cit> . however, tads have a sequence characteristic different from that of typical id regions: they exhibit a significantly higher propensity to form a-helices and b-strands. some attempts have been made to predict protein-protein interaction sites within id regions based on this difference in sequence  <cit> . while identification of functional sites in id regions is of biological importance, our concern in the present study was to divide protein molecules completely and accurately into structural domains and id regions. because of the intermediate nature of tads between structural domains and id regions, we paid special attention to distinguish structural domains and tads: our system uses the criteria that tads are shorter in length and are less conserved among homologues than structural domains. even though we set the cut-off value large enough  to cover all known tad fragments, our method works well not only for tads, but also for short sds: many dbds of less than  <dig> residues were correctly classified as sds. as a result, the tads erroneously assigned as structural domains in the previous study were reclassified as id regions .

CONCLUSIONS
we developed the system dichot to completely divide proteins into structural and un-structural regions. the system includes structural assignments by homology searches, and the disopred <dig> program as well as the new program cladist for id region prediction. cladist takes un-aligned regions into consideration to enable dichot to divide entire amino acid sequences into structural/un-structural regions. the resulting classification of protein molecules was shown to be highly reliable. as a natural extension, we will apply the method to all human proteins. the research will provide an accurate ratio of structural domains to id regions. moreover, it is expected to uncover a number of cryptic structural domains in human proteins, which, because of the high degree of reliability, may become targets of structural study.
