BACKGROUND
cervical cancer affects approximately  <dig>  women worldwide each year with highest rates in developing countries  <cit> . cervical intraepithelial neoplasia  is a precursor lesion to cervical cancer and can be further subdivided into cin i, cin ii and cin iii . most cin i lesions spontaneously regress to normal however cin iii lesions are much more likely to progress to cervical cancer if left untreated  <cit> . the cin i to cin ii junction may be critical in disease development.

human papillomavirus  is the recognized etiologic agent for cervical cancer however, alone it is not sufficient for invasive disease. hpv is detected in nearly all cervical cancers, 94% of cin lesions and up to 46% of normal cervical epithelium  <cit> . over  <dig> strains of hpv exist however hpv  <dig> and hpv  <dig> are considered highly virulent strains and account for the majority of cervical cancers  <cit> .

the study of cervical cancer prevention has progressed impressively in the recent past. widely implemented screening programs have resulted in 80% reduction of cervical cancer rates in north america within the past fifty years  <cit> . cytological assessment is currently the frontline method for identifying precancerous cervical lesions however repeat evaluations can frequently be required due to low sensitivity  <cit> . although vaccines against the most virulent strains of hpv have recently become available, vaccination is not an easily utilized resource for those countries most inflicted with the highest cervical cancer rates  <cit> . this is largely due to cost and that the administration of the vaccine occurs in three doses over six months to a pre-adolescent female population. few countries have established programmes targeting healthcare to this population  <cit> . in addition, perceived social implications in developed countries regarding vaccinating girls at an early age are hindering widespread administration. together, these social, clinical and genetic factors indicate that frontline monitoring will continue to play an important role in cervical cancer prevention and that improved methods and markers for detection are needed.

it is unclear that hpv alone is responsible for disease progression. a thorough understanding of genetic events in precancerous cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is required to both delineate important causal events in cervical cancer and to identify informative candidate biological markers. gene expression of cervical tissue and changes in expression pattern have been the focus of several recent publications. studies by pérez-plasencia et al and shadeo et al both characterized the transcriptome of normal cervical epithelium using serial analysis of gene expression   <cit> , additionally, gius et al reported changes in proproliferative/immunosuppression gene expression in cin i lesions, as well as proangiogenic and proinvasive expression signatures that coincide with cin ii and cin iii, respectively  <cit> .

in this study, we build upon our previous work in defining the normal cervical epithelial transcriptome and aim to identify genes differentially expressed between normal cervical epithelium and those precancerous lesions which are more apt to progress to cervical cancer if left without treatment . in this study we have distinguished gene expression aberrations across mild/moderate dysplasia  in addition to cin iii and non cancerous  cervical epithelium using an unbiased long serial analysis of gene expression  method that simultaneously allows for the discovery of tags which map to hpv  <dig>  in total, sixteen l-sage libraries were sequenced for a total of  <dig> , <dig> tags, establishing the largest sage data collection for cervical tissue worldwide. upon evaluation of expression differences between nc cervical epithelium and cin lesions, we have identified two gene networks directly or indirectly involved in chromatin remodelling altered in expression in cin iii.

RESULTS
l-sage libraries from cervical tissue
in this study  <dig> l-sage libraries were constructed and analyzed . libraries n <dig> to n <dig> were made from nc cervical tissue samples, m <dig> to m <dig> from cin i samples, m <dig>  to m <dig> from cin ii samples and c <dig>  to c <dig> from cin iii samples. n <dig>  n <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> were mined in a preliminary study characterizing normal cervical tissue  <cit> . collectively,  <dig> , <dig> useful tags were sequenced . this data collection has been made publicly available at gene expression omnibus, series accession number gse <dig>  <cit> .

early stage changes
the mean tag counts were compared between nc tissue samples  and mild/moderate stage  samples  in order to identify tags differentially expressed in the early stages of neoplasia. one-hundred sixty-nine tags were identified to be differentially expressed according to our selection criteria as described in methods . both increased and decreased expression is observed at comparable frequencies  and  <dig> of these tags mapped to known genes including loci encoding hypothetical proteins.

the most commonly affected biological process in the early events of disease is dna dependent regulation of transcription and transcription    <cit> .

late stage changes
the mean tag counts were compared between cini/ii tissue samples  and cin iii libraries . this identified  <dig> tags differentially expressed in later stages of neoplasia . seventy-three tags were increased in cin iii while  <dig> were decreased. overall  <dig> tags mapped to known genes. the major pathways affected by these genes were similar to those observed in early stage changes, dna dependent regulation of transcription and transcription    <cit> . twelve tags mapped to the hpv  <dig> genome that could not be mapped to the human genome or transcripts using methods previously described .  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> tags showed concurrent expression between all sixteen libraries .

pathway analysis of overall changes
the mean score of tags in the four nc libraries were compared to the mean score of tags in the six severe neoplasia libraries . we identified  <dig> tags increased in frequency in cin iii and  <dig> tags decreased and overall observed  <dig> tags differentially expressed between nc tissue and cin iii . two hundred and forty tags mapped to  <dig> unique genes. genes differentially expressed between normal and cin iii were evaluated for gene network associations using ingenuity pathway analysis  <cit> . biological functions most influenced by these genes include cell death, cell growth/proliferation and cellular movement . the gene network with the most number of differentially expressed genes influenced cellular processes such as cell cycle and cell morphology and involved  <dig> of the differentially expressed genes . the network with the higher magnitude gene expression changes influenced cell cycle and gene expression .

* the score is a numerical value used to rank networks according to how relevant they are to the genes in your input dataset. calculations are based on the hypergeometric distribution calculated via the computationally efficient fisher's exact test for  <dig> ×  <dig> contingency tables <dig>  gene symbols in bold denote those selected for validation in a new panel of fourteen cases.

eight genes from these networks were selected for validation in an independent panel of cervical samples . cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2b , retinoblastoma-like  <dig> and phosphatase and tensin homolog  had lower counts in the cin iii derived libraries. conversely, mof <dig> family associated protein  <dig> , mortality factor  <dig> like  <dig>  nuclear receptor co-repressor  <dig> , dihydrofolate reductase  and swi/snf related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily c, member  <dig> showed higher tag counts in the cin iii relative to nc.

the validation panel consists of  <dig> samples representing nc, cin i, cin ii and cin iii in addition to a tumor sample with paired normal tissue. quantitative analysis of expression was determined for each gene on this panel by real-time pcr using taqman® gene expression assays . ncor <dig> expression increased in nine of ten cin i/ii samples ranging from  <dig> – <dig>  fold increase relative to nc with a statistically significant overall all trend . smarcc <dig> expression increase was confirmed in six cin i/ii samples and four cin iii cases . similarly, we confirmed the increased expression of dhfr and mrfap <dig> in the validation panel including in nine of ten cin i/ii cases and six of seven cin iii cases and the overall trend of increase for this gene was statistically significant . morf4l <dig> expression increase was confirmed in eight of ten cin i/ii and six of seven cin iii with statistically significant overall trend of increase  in the validation panel. although we were able to confirm decreased cdkn2b expression in the tumour, we were unable to confirm this in the earlier staged cases in the validation panel. reduced expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog  was confirmed in two cin ii and two cin iii cases .

discussion
the study of precancer lesions is essential in understanding the initiating events in cancer development and is of particular importance in cervical cancer as moderate and high grade lesions  are more likely to progress to cancer than those of low grade . in this study, we have comprehensively evaluated gene expression changes in the precancerous stages of cervical cancer by comparing  <dig> cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and nc cervical specimens using the l-sage method of gene expression profile determination. we have sequenced a total of  <dig> , <dig> tags, establishing the largest sage data collection for cervical tissue worldwide. cin i, cin ii, ciniii as well as normal tissues are represented in this collection. in a preliminary study, we had identified keratin 6a , carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule  <dig> , s <dig> calcium-binding protein a <dig>  and small proline-rich protein  <dig>  to be highly expressed  in nc cervical tissue in the n <dig> and n <dig> libraries  <cit> . tags mapping to these genes are present at high levels in the additional normal libraries  unique to this study with the exception of ceceam <dig> which shows slightly reduced expression of  <dig> and  <dig> tpm . the decreasing trend in galectin  <dig>  and gap junction protein a <dig>  previously observed in cin iii when compared to normal mean values, continues to be true in this study .

early and late events
of the tags differentially expressed between nc and mild/moderate dysplasia , and between mild/moderate and severe dysplasia ; 25% fewer tags were altered in later stage disease. these differentially expressed tags most frequently mapped to genes involved in dna dependent regulation of transcription. interestingly, tags mapping to genes with biological functions unique to late stage changes include cell cycle , cell division , immune  and inflammatory  response.

biological characteristics of differentially expressed tags
of the  <dig> tags that are altered in expression in cin iii relative to nc, cell death, cell growth and proliferation, cell movement, cell cycle and dna replication, recombination and repair are the top five biological functions. these functions encompass characteristics frequently described as the hallmarks of cancer  <cit> .

tags mapping to seven unique genes showed a greater than ten fold increase in expression in cin iii libraries. a tag mapping to sec <dig> homolog  showed the greatest change as it was not present in any one of the four nc libraries. however, an average of  <dig> tpm were observed in cin iii libraries. additional tags with greater than ten fold change mapped to morf4l <dig>  mrfap <dig>  wd repeat domain  <dig>  smarcc <dig>  eukaryotic translation elongation factor  <dig> gamma  and g protein-coupled receptor  <dig> . smarcc <dig> is a component of the chromatin remodeling complex swi/snf while both mrfap <dig> and morf4l <dig> belong to the mgf/morf family of transcription factors involved in growth, cell senescence and are implicated indirectly in chromatin remodeling  <cit> . wdr <dig> is a member of the wd repeat protein family. members of this gene family are involved in a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, apoptosis, and gene regulation  <cit> . tags mapping to this gene varied in counts between nc and cin iii by greater than twelve fold increase in the latter subgroup. eef1g is a subunit of the elongation factor- <dig> complex involved in translation and gpr <dig> contains transmembrane domains and may play a role in vascular remodelling  <cit> . it is interesting to note that both homeobox b <dig>  and bh <dig> interacting domain death agonist  are also increased in cin iii although to a lesser magnitude . many of the described genes may have the potential to influence processes characteristic of epithelial cancers such as, apoptosis , angiogenesis , proliferation , and transcription influencing events . functional assays are required to delineate their biological function in cin and cervical cancer.

network analysis
upon further investigation of the  <dig> differentially expressed tags between nc and cin iii,  <dig> mapped to  <dig> unique genes. when analyzed for gene network relationships, many of the genes targeted pathways influencing properties such as cell cycle, cell morphology, cancer related events and gene expression. in this study, we have identified a group of  <dig> genes that fall into two gene networks encompassing these properties. the first network  contains  <dig> of the differentially expressed genes while the second network  includes  <dig> of the  <dig> genes. only cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2b  and kruppel-like factor  <dig>  overlap between network a and b. network b includes three of the seven tags showing greater than  <dig> fold change and one of the five tags showing more than  <dig> fold decrease in nc when compared to cin iii. genes from both networks were selected for validation in a new cervical tissue panel.

network a
cell cycle, cancer and cell morphology are the top functions influenced by genes in network a. sixteen genes differentially expressed between nc and cin iii are involved in this network including rbl2/p <dig>  smarcc <dig>  ncor <dig>  pten, dhfr and cdkn2b.

rbl2/p <dig> is one of three members of the retinoblastoma  gene family, others include rbl1/p <dig> and rb <dig>  <cit> . this family of proteins regulate cell cycle through the g1/s phase by sequestering e2f transcriptional regulators. loss and mutations in rbl2/p <dig> have been linked to various cancers  <cit> . e <dig> from high risk hpv strains targets all member of the rb family including rbl2/p <dig>  for degradation thus releasing sequestered e2f and allowing for passage through the g1/s phase  <cit> . zhang et al found that low risk hpv  <dig> e <dig> also has the capacity to bind rbl2/p <dig> although not with as high affinity and did not bind to the other member of the rb family  <cit> . we observed a progressive reduction in rbl2/p <dig> transcripts from nc to mild/moderate dysplasia and severe dysplasia suggesting that a reduction in rbl2/p <dig> may also be regulated at the transcriptional level in cervical preneoplasia and may be the first rb family gene event in the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.

smarcc <dig> is a member of the swi/snf family of genes. members of this evolutionarily conserved gene family are proposed to regulate gene specific transcription with downstream effects in cell cycle progression  <cit> . smarcc <dig> has recently been reported to directly interact with components of the atp-dependent swi/snf chromatin remodelling complex including, swi/snf-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin a <dig> , brg1-associated factor a  and swi/snf-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin b <dig>   <cit> . the swi/snf chromatin remodelling complex consists of approximately ten components and is thought to regulate gene transcription by altering the surrounding chromatin structure. this complex can recruit both histone acetyltransferases  and histone deacetyltransferases  in a gene specific manner thus influencing gene expression  <cit> . the swi/snf chromatin remodelling complex also has been implicated in hormone receptor signalling and growth  <cit> . smarcc <dig> was characterized as a key regulator of core complex components  by positively influencing the stabilization of the complex proteins as opposed to regulation of their transcription  <cit> . in our study, there was no expression change in these core components. in contrast, we observed an  <dig> fold increase in tags mapping to smarcc <dig> in cin iii libraries when compared to normal libraries suggesting that swi/snf chromatin remodelling complex stability may have a role in severe dysplasia development.

dhfr is involved in folate metabolism in eukaryotes and is essential for purine and thymidylate biosynthesis and thus dna replication  <cit> . we observed over a 250% increase in both mild/moderate and severe dysplasia as compared to normal, indicating that this event is present in very early stage lesions. it has recently been reported that dhfr is subjected to rb mediated repression via swi/snf chromatin remodelling activity  <cit> . the increase in dhfr observed is in concordance with the expected downstream effects of decreased rb gene family repression.

ncor <dig> is involved in transcription repression via chromatin condensation. it has been found to physically interact with members of the swi/snf complex, including smarcc <dig> and core component brg <dig>  <cit> . we observed greater than 300% increase in ncor <dig> in severe and mild/moderate dysplasia relative to normal suggesting an increase in ncor <dig> occurs very early in disease development .

phosphatase and tensin homolog , an established tumour suppressor gene, functions through the akt/pkb signalling pathway  <cit> . we found pten to decrease in expression in cin ii/cin i libraries by > <dig> fold compared to normal indicating that this may be an early event. cdkn2b negatively regulates cdk <dig> and cdk <dig>  <cit> . we found cdkn2b decreased in cin iii libraries by nearly  <dig>  fold when compared to nc. decreased expression of cdkn2b has not been found due to copy number loss or mutation in cervical cancer  <cit> .

genes from network a were selected for validation in a new  <dig> sample set consisting nc, cin i, cin ii and cin iii cervix tissue and one tumour and normal pair. a similar pattern of fold change is present in this panel for dhfr, smarcc <dig> and ncor <dig> in all three subgroups. specifically, increased expression is observed in all three cin ii and two cin iii in the new cervical tissue panel, validating the disruption of genes involved in chromatin remodelling.

for pten, we observed a decrease in one of the three cin iii cases investigated which is consistent with lee et al who found pten to be reduced in protein expression in only 10% of cin iii cervical cases and 18% of cervical cancers  <cit> . we also found cdkn2b to be over expressed in all cin i, two cin ii and one cin iii however, greater than four fold decrease in cervical cancer  was observed. it has been reported that cervical cancers and cin iii lesion have elevated levels of cdkn2b   <cit> .

network b
fourteen genes differentially expressed between normal and cin iii targeted network b including mrfap <dig>  morfl <dig> and cdkn2b. top functions influenced by network b include cancer related factors, cell cycle and gene expression. the previously discussed gene cdkn2b overlaps with this network.

mrfap <dig> binds with strong affinity to mortality factor  <dig> like  <dig>   <cit> . mrg <dig> is a member of the mrg/morf family of genes. all members contain a mrg domain which has the capacity to bind multiple transcriptional regulators  <cit> . members of this gene family are suggested to be involved in embryonic development, cell proliferation and senescence  <cit> . mrg <dig> is a component of the mrg associated factors  <dig> and  <dig> complexes  and thus has a putative role in chromatin remodelling  <cit> . mrg <dig> has been shown to specifically associate with mrfap <dig> in maf <dig>  tumour suppressor rb and the mammalian co repressor complex, msin3a  <cit> . we observed a  <dig>  fold increase of mrfap <dig> in cin iii libraries when compared to nc libraries. notably, the majority of this increase occurs between mild/moderate and severe dysplasia. although the biological mechanisms of mrfap <dig> and mrg <dig> interaction has yet to be described, it is plausible that the relationship may influence the essential role mrg <dig> plays in chromatin remodelling.

we observed a  <dig> fold increase of morf4l <dig> in cin iii libraries. like mrg <dig>  morf4l <dig> also belongs to the mrg/morf transcriptional regulator family of genes involved in senescence and cell growth  <cit> . although the two genes share nearly 90% similarity, morf4l <dig> is unique to vertebrates whereas mrg <dig> is evolutionarily conserved  <cit> . similarly to mrg <dig>  morf4l <dig> directly interacts with mrfap <dig> and the msin3a co repressor complex, components of which include hdac <dig> and hdca <dig> and are involved in chromatin remodelling  <cit> . morf4l <dig> is reported to have both repressive and stimulatory activity in transcription regulation of well known cell cycle regulator, v-myb myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog -like  <dig>   <cit> .

mrfap <dig> and morfl <dig> were selected from network b for validation in  <dig> new samples as described above. in both cases, six of seven cin iii samples showed the greatest increase in expression  and the overall increasing trend was found to be statistically significant . we observed a  <dig> – <dig>  fold increase in expression in cervical cancer . together, these results validate the differential expression again supporting a potential role of chromatin remodelling in cervical cancer progression.

this differential expression in the chromatin remodelling genes could result in changes in the organization of the dna. if these changes are large enough they could be detectable. previously, we quantified changes in nuclear texture with increasing grade of cin  <cit> . these measured phenotype changes, as seen in figure  <dig> , begin with cin i and are more prominent in the high grades of cin  and cancer  <cit> . this appears to correlate cis with the novel observations presented in the present study with respect to the increased expression of chromatin remodelling complex components indicating that these expression changes result in an alteration of the cell/nuclear phenotype.

CONCLUSIONS
events in expression change involving genes in network a and network b  occur at or before the stage of moderate dysplasia . these events are maintained, although at a reduced frequency, in cin iii suggesting a role in intermediate events prior to severe dysplasia that may be an important stepping stone in disease progression. genomic instability is characteristic of cin iii lesions and cervical cancer, as such the non-maintenance of such aberrations in later stages may be due to the masking the of initial events by additional changes acquired in severe dysplasia  <cit> .

deregulation of chromatin remodelling functions has analogous effects to mutation in dna repair components in that the repercussions can be genome wide. it is interesting that evidentially two deregulated genes from both networks investigated are associated with chromatin remodelling  and such disruptions are targeted to the critical stage of moderate dysplasia. the increase in swi/snf stabilizing molecule smarcc <dig> and other novel genes has not been previously illustrated as events in the early stages of dysplasia development thus providing not only novel candidate markers for screening but a biological function for targeting treatment. together, our results suggest altered expression events in chromatin remodelling complex components and influencing factors occur in precancerous cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. future investigation on protein dna interaction will be necessary to further elucidate the precise role of chromatin remodelling in cervical cancer progression.
