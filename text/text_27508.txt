BACKGROUND
crustacean y-larvae  were first described from marine plankton in the late 1800s  <cit> , and they have since been recorded from the arctic to the tropical waters of all oceans  <cit> . the adult organisms have never been identified, and the facetotecta is the only crustacean group with a formal taxonomy based solely on larval stages  <cit> . at our study site, sesoko island near okinawa, japan, the enigmatic y-larvae form a significant and diverse component in the plankton. based on previous extensive sampling at sesoko island  <cit>  and on an extensive collection of mounted final naupliar exuviae  we found that more than  <dig> morphological types of y-larvae occur there, often abundantly and all representing undescribed species. ontogenetic, morphological and molecular evidence all point to a taxonomic relationship with the crustacean class thecostraca. these comprise the well-known barnacles  and the ascothoracida, but the facetotecta forms a separate subclass and is not an ingroup in any of these two taxa  <cit> . thecostracan crustaceans have sessile adults and a development comprised of a series of nauplius larvae and a final stage, the cyprid, specialized for attachment  <cit> . similarly, the developmental sequence hitherto known for y-larvae  comprises a series of  naupliar instars and a succeeding stage, the y-cyprid , which is obviously adapted for settlement  <cit> . among the related groups, the ascothoracida are parasites in anthozoans and echinoderms while the cirripedia, mostly comprised of suspension feeding organisms, also include the rhizocephala, one of the most specialized groups of parasites within crustacea  <cit> . this has prompted speculations that the facetotecta are also parasitic  <cit> , whence a study of the metamorphosis of their larvae could yield crucial information about the unknown adults. however, until now it has not been possible to rear y-larvae past the cyprid stage  <cit> .

RESULTS
exposure to 20-he at concentrations within the effective range  induced y-cyprids to metamorphose into a new and unexpected instar . this 300– <dig> μm long juvenile has a greatly simplified morphology and is surrounded by an extremely thin  cuticle. we documented this metamorphosis from several 'species' of y-cyprids by still photography, video and transmission electron microscopy ; see figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  following exposure to the hormone, metamorphosis begins after 12– <dig> hours by a retraction of all, or nearly all, cyprid tissues into a compact body anteriorly, which is then surrounded by the newly secreted, thin cuticle. while still inside the y-cyprid, the body of the juvenile begins to exhibit contractions and bending motions. aided by these motions it exits from the y-cyprid after 31– <dig> hours through a hole between the bases of the antennules in a process lasting 2– <dig> hours . the molted juvenile has been named the 'ypsigon', which refers to 'ypsilon'  and 'gonos' . the ypsigon is unsegmented, slug-like and lacks appendages . the body motions persists after escape and allow the ypsigon to crawl on the bottom of the culture vessel and move several body lengths away from the spent y-cyprid within a few minutes .

like the preceding y-nauplius and y-cyprid stages, the ypsigon lacks a functional gut, but an elongated, dark mass of cells filled with fat globules and extending through most of the body may represent a vestige of this organ system . within the ypsigon body the muscles and compound eyes of the preceding y-cyprid stage are in a state of advanced degeneration .

the ultrathin cuticle and the decomposing compound eyes are the only morphological indications of its arthropod affiliation . according to the species tested, the resulting ypsigon could differ in morphology from being elongated to having a rather plump shape, but it always exhibited the same simplified structure . ypsigons kept alive in culture for more than  <dig> hours passed through a molt that yielded another, second juvenile stage . this second ypsigon stage had the same morphology as the first and continued to exhibit the same bending motions until they were preserved  <dig> hours after emerging from the y-cyprid .

discussion
within arthropoda, the extreme morphological reduction seen in the new ypsigon stage is matched only by the early endoparasitic 'vermigon' stage recently discovered in certain parasitic barnacles, the rhizocephala kentrogonida  <cit> . both the vermigon and the ypsigon are formed by comparable metamorphic molts, in which the epidermis withdraws from the old cuticle, closes around all organs in the body and thereby forms the new slug-shaped stage. in addition, both the vermigon and the ypsigon exhibit vigorous body movements after their escape from the cypris, and they have virtually the same reduced morphology, being surrounded only by an exceedingly thin and very pliable cuticle and lacking segmentation, appendages and sensory organs. metamorphic stages of rhizocephalans, similar to those emerging from naturally settled larvae  <cit> , have been produced when chemically inducing cyprids to metamorphose in vitro  <cit> . by analogy with the rhizocephalan vermigon  <cit>  and our observation that the ypsigon does not change morphology at the first molt after escape, all evidence appears consistent with the ypsigon also being endoparasitic, eventually giving rise to a parasitic adult. this conclusion is also supported by comparison with the similarly apodous commiform larvae in the more distantly related entoniscid isopoda  <cit> . however, while rhizocephalans are incontestable members of the barnacles , facetotectans diverge as a separate subclass at the base of the thecostracan phylogenetic tree and must represent a wholly separate evolution of extremely specialized parasites  <cit> . the evolution of very similar, slug-shaped endoparasitic stages  in two different lineages  is therefore a stunning example of convergent evolution. analogy with the rhizocephala also leads to the prediction that the adult facetotectan will turn out to have a highly simplified structure and this may help to explain why they have escaped observation. future efforts will focus both on culturing the ypsigon in vitro to more advanced stages and screening of the local fauna to identify the host animals.

CONCLUSIONS
while we cannot yet identify the adult y-organism or its host, the new, highly aberrant and obviously endoparasitic stage in the life history of the facetotecta takes us a major step towards the solution of an enigma that has puzzled zoologists for more than  <dig> years  <cit> . it has been documented that parasites can significantly affect the structure of ecosystems, especially when they are parasitic castrators and/or are affecting host behavior  <cit> . our observation of more than  <dig> facetotectan 'species' at a single study site indicates that a hitherto unknown and diverse fauna of advanced endoparasites remain hidden and could play important roles in many marine habitats.
