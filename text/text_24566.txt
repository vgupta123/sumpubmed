BACKGROUND
pseudomonas putida is a non-pathogenic member of rrna group i of the genus pseudomonas that colonizes many different environments and is well known for its broad metabolic versatility and genetic plasticity  <cit> . p. putida kt <dig> is a tol plasmid cured, spontaneous restriction deficient derivative of p. putida mt- <dig>  <cit> . this strain represents the first host-vector biosafety system for cloning in gram-negative soil bacteria and hence, has been extensively used as a host for gene cloning and expression of heterologous genes  <cit> . consequently, large efforts have been made in exploiting these capacities in a diverse range of biotechnological applications including i) bioremediation of contaminated areas  <cit> ; ii) quality improvement of fossil fuels, e.g., by desulphurization  <cit> ; iii) biocatalytic production of fine chemicals  <cit> ; iv) production of bioplastic  <cit> ; and v) as agents of plant growth promotion and plant pest control  <cit> .

since the publication of p. putida kt2440's genome  <cit> , our knowledge about this strain has significantly increased  <cit>  and various "-omics" data sets have become available, such as transcriptomic  <cit> , proteomic  <cit> , and fluxomic data  <cit> . subsequently, some in silico analyses of its metabolic and biotechnological capacities have been published  <cit> . however, systemic understanding of metabolic and biotechnology capabilities of p. putida kt <dig> requires the construction of a more comprehensive model enabling the integration of the canonical experimental data along with genomic and high-throughput data in a hierarchical and coherent fashion  <cit> .

the constraint-based reconstruction and analysis  approach is one possible modeling approach that uses stoichiometric information about biochemical transformation taking place in a target organism to construct the model. while a metabolic reconstruction is unique to the target organism one can derive many different condition-specific models from a single reconstruction. this conversion of a metabolic reconstruction of an organism into models requires the imposition of physicochemical and environmental constraints to define systems boundaries  <cit> . the conversion also includes the transformation of the reaction list into a computable, mathematical matrix format. in this so-called s matrix, where s stands for stoichiometric, the rows correspond to the network metabolites and the columns to the network reactions. the coefficients of the substrates and products of each reaction are entered in the corresponding cell of the matrix. this conversion can be done automatically . once in this format, numerous mathematical tools can be used to interrogate the metabolic network properties in silico. many of the published mathematical tools have been reviewed  <cit>  and encoded in matlab format  <cit> . a large subset of these tools relies on linear programming , a mathematical tool used to find a solution to an optimization problem . while lp-based tools are very helpful in studying reconstructed metabolic networks, some questions may better be addressed without having to choose an objective function. those methods are called unbiased methods, in contrast to biased lp-based methods, because they identify all feasible flux distributions under the given set of environmental constraints rather than only the optimal distributions. the cobra approach  <cit>  has been successfully used to build and analyze genome-scale in silico reconstructions for representatives of archaea , of bacteria , and of eukarya . the numerous mathematical tools have been used for i) identification and filling of knowledge gaps ; ii) prediction of the outcome of adaptive evolution  <cit> ; iii) design of engineered production strains  <cit> ; and iv) the understanding of topological features of metabolic networks  <cit> . a recent review illustrates the variety of questions that have been addressed to e. coli's metabolic network using different biased and unbiased cobra methods  <cit> .

here, we describe a highly detailed, genome-scale, metabolic reconstruction of pseudomonas putida kt <dig>  based on the naming convention for metabolic networks  <cit> , this genome scale reconstruction was deemed ijn <dig>  where i stands for in silico, jn are the initials of the constructor, and  <dig> corresponds to the number of included metabolic genes. the reconstruction was built using the cobra approach  <cit>  and validated using flux balance analysis . the in silico metabolic network was further evaluated by comparing i) predicted growth rate capacities in different carbon sources and ii) predicted essential genes with experimental data from p. putida kt <dig> and p. aeruginosa. finally, we show the utility of the p. putida reconstruction to analyze its biodegradative  and biotechnological  capacities.

RESULTS
characteristics of the metabolic reconstruction of pseudomonas putida kt2440
the metabolic reconstruction of p. putida kt <dig>  ijn <dig>  was constructed based on its annotated genome sequence  <cit> , primary and review publications, various genetic and biochemical databases , and biochemical information found in pseudomonas-specific  <cit>  and biochemical textbooks.

ijn <dig> accounts for  <dig> open reading frames , whose corresponding gene products are involved in  <dig> metabolic and transport reactions . a total of  <dig> non-gene associated reactions were included in ijn <dig> based on physiological evidence in literature supporting their presence in p. putida's metabolism. hence, the reconstruction captures a total of  <dig> metabolic reactions and  <dig> metabolites distributed over three different cellular compartments: cytoplasm, periplasm, and extracellular space. each metabolite was placed in one or more of these compartments depending on the cellular localization of the catalyzing enzyme, and the flux across outer and inner membranes was enabled by transport reactions.

reconstruction & organism
properties of metabolic reconstruction of p. putida kt <dig> were compared with recently published metabolic reconstructions of e. coli mg <dig> , b. subtilis , and m. tuberculosis h37rv  and p. aeruginosa . a taken from kegg  <cit> ; b based on riley et al.  <cit> ; c species knowledge index  was calculated as described in  <cit> .

the reactions included in ijn <dig> were divided into  <dig> specific pathways, or subsystems, based on their functional role . in general, the transport subsystem was found to be the subsystem with the highest number of gene-associated reactions, highlighting the importance of cellular transport for p. putida. this observation agrees well with the known lifestyle of p. putida  <cit>  and successfully reflects the fact that approx. 12% of p. putida genome encodes for transport-associated gene products  <cit> . reactions related to amino acid metabolism were also found to be very important since the de novo synthesis pathways for all  <dig> amino acids are present in p. putida's genome  <cit> . moreover, p. putida is known for its capability to utilize many amino acids as a carbon and nitrogen source  <cit> . a third group of great importance contained reactions involved in aromatic acid degradation pathways, which reflects the physiological ability of p. putida to use many of these compounds as a carbon and energy source   <cit> . furthermore, despite the absence of the tol pathway in kt2440's genome, the plasmid genes and the corresponding reactions were included into the p. putida metabolic reconstruction since the tol plasmid is present in the parental strain p. putida mt- <dig> and this paradigmatic plasmid is often used to expand p. putida kt2440's metabolic capacities  <cit> . finally, reactions associated with lipid metabolism constituted another important subsystem group. in fact, p. putida kt <dig> can synthesize and accumulate medium-side-chain polyhydroxyalkanoates , which are lipid related polymers, from a wide range of carbon sources  <cit> . this ability is of special interest for biotechnological purposes  and therefore, we incorporated both the msc-phas biosynthetic and tol biodegradative pathways into the metabolic reconstruction .

every network reaction was associated with confidence scores based on the available evidence for its presence in the p. putida metabolic network . for instance, reactions whose enzymes have been biochemically studied in p. putida received a confidence score of  <dig>  if physiological or genetic knockout information was available, a score of  <dig> was associated with the network reaction. reactions associated with enzymes that were only annotated in p. putida's genome but had no further experimental evidence were given a confidence score of  <dig>  finally, during the evaluation of the network functionality  some reactions had to be added to the network for which no genetic or experimental evidence could be found. those reactions represent modeling hypotheses, which need further experimental validation and thus received a confidence score of  <dig>  upon completion, the reconstruction had an overall average confidence score of  <dig> . in fact, two thirds of p. putida's metabolic pathways have been very well or well studied, while only a third of the subsystems were primarily based on the genome annotation . this high level of confidence is also reflected by the number of references that lead to this metabolic reconstruction. almost 90% of the internal reactions  have at least one associated citation, while a total of  <dig> unique primary and review publications were reviewed and incorporated into this reconstruction. subsequently, this first genome-scale reconstruction of p. putida's metabolism represents a comprehensive knowledge base summarizing and categorizing the information currently available. the content of this knowledge base will be easily accessible through the bigg database .

comparison of scope and content of ijn <dig> with published metabolic networks
the properties of ijn <dig> were compared with the properties of recently published reconstructions of e. coli mg <dig> , b. subtilis , m. tuberculosis h37rv , and p. aeruginosa pao <dig> . we found that the percentage of included orfs was smaller in ijn <dig> than in the other reconstructions. subsequently, it can be expected that the number of metabolic functions present in p. putida is larger than currently identified in the genome annotation and literature. in fact, the number of included non-gene associated reactions was twice that of the e. coli metabolic reconstruction. furthermore, the species knowledge index   <cit> , which relates the number of pubmed abstracts of an organism to its number of orfs, was much lower for p. putida compared to the other reconstructions. in summary, this comparison indicates that the overall context coverage in ijn <dig> is comparable with other high-quality network reconstructions when the amount of available literature is considered.

a metabolic reconstruction for another representative of the pseudomonas genera was published recently  <cit> . a comparison of p. putida and p. aeruginosa metabolic reconstructions was performed . in contrast to p. putida, p. aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen and as such more information about its metabolism and physiology is available, which is directly reflected by a ski value  <dig> times higher than that of p. putida . as a consequence, a larger number of metabolic genes were included in the metabolic reconstruction . despite being close relatives, these two representatives have significant differences in lifestyle and metabolic capabilities. subsequently, the two metabolic reconstructions have significant differences, emphasizing the importance of organism-specific reconstructions. for instance, the p. aeruginosa reconstruction contains pathways necessary for growth and production of common virulence factors, including alginate, rhamnolipids, phenezines, and quorum-sensing molecules  <cit> , which are not present in p. putida's metabolic network. in contrast, p. aeruginosa's metabolic network does not account for pathways necessary to degrade aromatic compounds.

ijn746's metabolic versatility
flux balance analysis  can provide insight into the growth capabilities of the reconstructed network. comparison of in silico growth performance with experimental data allows for the assessment of the predictive potential of the metabolic reconstruction and thus represents a valuable tool for network evaluation. furthermore, in silico growth analysis may expand the known array of carbon-, nitrogen-, and energy sources of the reconstructed organism. in this study, the aerobic growth capabilities of ijn <dig> in im <dig> medium substituted with different carbon sources were determined qualitatively  and quantitatively . the growth simulation results reflected the metabolic versatility for which p. putida is well known, with a total of  <dig> carbon sources enabling in silico growth when added to the im <dig> minimal medium . furthermore, we compared the in silico growth performance on different carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen sources with phenotyping data derived from literature . for instance, p. putida is found in terrestrial and aquatic environments around the world, with preference for the rhizosphere  <cit> , which is especially rich in carbon sources, amino acids, organic acids, and aromatic acids derived from seeds, roots, and other plant parts  <cit> . this niche specificity accounts for the broad carbon source usage of kt <dig> and therefore, most of the known soil carbon sources were captured in ijn <dig> . of particular biotechnological importance is the ability of ijn <dig> to metabolize aromatic compounds, thus, representing the first metabolic reconstruction accounting for growth on these carbon sources. for example, aromatic compounds such as toluene or xylene are of special interest as they are archetypical pollutants. subsequently, we studied the toluene degradation process using ijn <dig> .

carbon sources enabling growth of ijn <dig> in im <dig> mineral medium. the compounds were grouped based their structural characteristics. a complete list of carbon sources tested, along with possible nitrogen and sulfur sources, as well as bibliographic support can be found in the additional file  <dig> 

no false positive carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur sources were found in ijn <dig>  as expected, as only exchange reactions were included in the reconstruction for metabolites, which have been reported to be taken up or secreted by p. putida kt <dig>  in contrast, some disagreements, such as false negatives, were observed despite a good overall agreement with the in vivo data  <cit>  . for example, it was reported that p. putida can use l-alanine as a carbon- and nitrogen-source  <cit>  but ijn <dig> cannot use this compound as a carbon or nitrogen source. this disagreement could not be resolved. in contrast, ijn <dig> was initially unable to use choline-o-sulphate, choline, or glycine betaine as carbon- and nitrogen-sources despite experimental evidence  <cit> . however, the addition of two non-gene-associated reactions, betaine-homocysteine s-methyltransferase  and dimethylglycine dehydrogenase , enabled ijn <dig> to use these metabolites as carbon- and nitrogen-sources through the glycine metabolism. in addition, choline-o-sulphate could also be used as sulfur source . the two added reactions represent a hypothesis that needs further experimental verification. these examples show how discrepancies between in silico predictions and physiological properties can be used to drive new discoveries, as was shown for e. coli  <cit> .

growth on glucose
p. putida kt <dig>  like other pseudomonas species and rhizosymbionts, has an incomplete glycolytic pathway because of a missing 6-phosphofructokinase  <cit> . however, p. putida kt <dig> has a complete entner-doudoroff pathway, which allows for the utilization of glucose and other sugars as carbon sources . therefore, we investigated the properties of glucose metabolism in ijn <dig> to validate and evaluate the reconstructed network  <cit> . for instance, comparison of predicted in silico growth with experimental data permits a direct assessment of the predictive potential of a reconstructed metabolic network. subsequently, we determined the aerobic growth capability of ijn <dig> in glucose-m <dig> minimal medium . interestingly, ijn <dig> grew faster in glucose than experimental in vivo data suggested for p. putida kt <dig> . a similar difference in growth rate between in vivo and in silico measurements was reported for p. aeruginosa  <cit> . the difference in growth rate might be explained by an incomplete formulation of biomass function or higher energy maintenance requirements not accounted for in the current reconstruction  <cit>  or missing adaptation to glucose as primary carbon source. another explanation could be that p. putida kt <dig> converts only a part of glucose into biomass. in fact, a recent study showed that p. putida kt <dig> accumulated low, extracellular concentrations of gluconate and 2-ketogluconate when grown on glucose  <cit> . p. putida metabolizes glucose exclusively via the entner-doudoroff pathway in which 6-phosphogluconate is the key intermediate. this compound is produced by three convergent pathways; the glucokinase branch, the gluconokinase branch, and the 2-ketogluconate loop  <cit> . the latter two pathways produce gluconate and 2-ketogluconate as intermediate compounds of the glucose catabolism. ijn <dig> accounts for these alternate routes and corresponding transport reactions for gluconate and 2-ketogluconate.

strain
comparison of growth performance of the in silico strain ijn <dig> and kt <dig>  the in silico growth rate was calculated in im <dig> minimal medium plus glucose or toluene. due to candidate oxygen limited growth in toluene, the in silico growth rate was calculated under different oxygen uptake rates in addition ijn <dig> growth in toluene as only carbon source was simulated at different oxygen uptake rates. a from  <cit> ; b from <cit> ; c from  <cit> , and d experimentally determined in this study.

growth on toluene
aromatic compounds such as toluene or xylene are found in polluted soil. some pseudomonas species are known to grow on these compounds as a sole carbon source  <cit> , making them interesting candidates for bioremediation of contaminated areas  <cit> . as indicated above, p. putida kt <dig> can metabolize various aromatic acids, amino acids, sugars, organic acids, fatty acids, and organo-sulfur compounds . more specifically, p. putida kt <dig> degrades many aromatic compounds into a limited number of intermediates using a few catabolic pathways that were captured in ijn <dig> . in particular, the toluene biodegradation pathway has been extensively studied in p. putida  <cit>  and its genetic regulation is well known  <cit> . in this study, we assessed the capability of ijn <dig> to quantitatively predict aerobic growth on toluene . the comparison showed a much lower in silico growth rate when compared to in vivo data,  <dig>  versus  <dig>   . in the following, we used different mathematical tools to elucidate reasons for this significant discrepancy.

reduced cost of toluene catabolism
linear programming  problems have two parameters, shadow price and reduced cost, which can be used to characterize the optimal solution. while shadow prices are associated with each network metabolite, reduced costs are associated with each network reaction. the reduced cost signifies the amount by which the objective function  would increase when the flux rate through a chosen reaction was increased by a single unit  <cit> . analyses of the reduced costs associated with uptake rates in the oxygen-limited toluene simulations identified the our as the only non-zero reduced cost value,  <dig>  g biomass/gdw/h. this value corresponds to an increase of the our to  <dig> mmol oxygen/gdw/h to achieve the experimentally determined growth rate  <cit> . at an our higher than  <dig> mmol oxygen/gdw/h oxygen is no longer a growth-limiting factor but toluene is. note that the upper limit of  <dig>  mmol oxygen/gdw/h for the our was taken from measurements for e. coli corresponding to the normal oxygen diffusion rate under atmospheric oxygen conditions  <cit> . mathematically, the reduced cost analysis supports the hypothesis that oxygen is the limiting factor for toluene catabolism and hence causes the reduced in silico growth rate.

phase plane analysis of toluene catabolism and oxygen uptake
we performed a phase plane analysis to further elucidate the correlation between toluene uptake, our, and biomass production rate . we analyzed all four cases listed in table  <dig> and found a direct effect of increased our on the toluene uptake capability and biomass production rate . the experimentally observed growth rate of  <dig>  μmax  <cit>  was achieved by tur ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  mmol toluene/gdw/h and our higher than  <dig> mmol oxygen/gdw/h. note that a higher toluene uptake rate  requires a higher our , which indicates that the removal of intracellular oxygen was dependent on toluene availability. in fact, the three oxidative reactions involved in the conversion of toluene to 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde  were found to have the higher flux rates besides the flux through the cytochrome c oxidase, an enzyme of the oxidative phosphorylation .

in order to better understand this situation and since no detailed information about our was found for p. putida kt <dig> under toluene-dependent growth conditions, we carried out in vivo experiments to determine the our of p. putida kt <dig> harboring the tol plasmid . as expected, the our in toluene growing cells was higher than glucose or octanoate growing cells;  <dig>  compared to  <dig>  and  <dig>  mmol oxygen/gdw/h, respectively . the measured our uptake rate for growth in toluene did not explain the high oxygen requirement of the model, but clearly indicates the importance of oxygen uptake in toluene metabolism. also, the measured our was slightly higher than the e. coli value that was used for the standard in silico simulations . in fact, oxygen dependent growth of toluene grown cells has been described for other p. putida strains. for example, alagappan and cowan reported a 10× higher oxygen-half saturation of p. putida f <dig> grown on toluene than other aerobic organisms  <cit> . furthermore, the oxidative stress caused by toluene and other aromatic acids in the degradative process is well known  <cit> ; however, this phenomenon was found to be mainly caused by reactive oxygen species due to incomplete oxygen reduction  <cit> , indicating an active oxygen metabolism under this growth condition. oxygen-limiting growth conditions were also reported for p. putida when grown on octanoate  <cit> .

taken together, our analysis suggests that the current p. putida metabolic network is incomplete. in fact, the current information and results suggest that the network is missing one or more reactions enabling a more oxygen-efficient catabolism of toluene and other highly reduced carbon sources . this analysis represents a nice example of the broad range of applications for which ijn <dig> can be used to evaluate the consistency of experimental data and in silico prediction. ijn <dig> can serve as a platform to derive hypotheses about metabolic capabilities or missing functions in the network which can be ultimately tested in the laboratory. hence, the metabolic reconstruction can help to increase our understanding and knowledge about this biotechnologically important organism.

gene essentiality analysis in ijn746
ijn <dig> was used as a framework to analyze candidate essential genes in p. putida kt <dig> in lb rich medium. therefore, the network reaction associated with each gene was individually "deleted" by setting the flux to  <dig> and optimizing for the biomass function  <cit> . we wished to compare the in silico essentiality predictions with experimental data to assess the predictive potential of the model. however, no large-scale, experimental gene essentiality data are available for p. putida; the information can only be found for its phylogenetic relative p. aeruginosa pao <dig> and p. aeruginosa pa <dig>  <cit> . a recently published comparison between the p. putida and p. aeruginosa pao <dig> genomes identified  <dig>  potential orthologous pairs corresponding to 60% of p. putida's total orfs, as well as large sections of conserved gene order   <cit> . therefore, we decided to compare our in silico single gene deletion results with the  <dig> essential metabolic and non-metabolic genes of p. aeruginosa  <cit> . about 12%  of the  <dig> metabolic genes present in ijn <dig> were predicted to be essential in ilb medium . a total of 53%  of these predicted essential genes in ijn <dig> agreed with essential genes of p. aeruginosa . more importantly, the  <dig> genes wrongly predicted as essential genes represent excellent targets for further refinement and expansion of the metabolism of ijn <dig>  as has been done for e. coli  <cit> .

false-positive predictions
the disagreement between the experimental and computational results can reveal possible errors in the experimental data as well as in the reconstructed network. the disagreements might be caused by low experimental or sequence evidences, each of which would have hindered the inclusion of the information into the reconstruction. for example, the fabb gene was predicted to be only essential in ijn746; however, after carrying out a detailed search on pseudomona's genomes using "the pseudomonas genome database v2"  we found putative orfs in the kt <dig> and pa <dig> genome. these orfs were annotated as alternative loci that could substitute a fabb deletion. both, p. putida and p. aeruginosa have one copy of the fabb gene encoding for the 3-oxoacyl-synthase i . in addition, both strains have a copy of the fabf gene encoding for the 3-oxoacyl- synthase ii  and pa <dig> . moreover, in the p. putida and p. aeruginosa genome, some orfs were annotated putatively to encode for a 3-oxoacyl- synthase ii  and pp_ <dig>  in kt <dig>  and pa_ <dig>  in pao <dig> strain. these putative orfs were not included in ijn <dig> due to the lack of supporting evidence for their metabolic function, but this analysis showed that i) pao <dig> has an isozyme present in its genome, and ii) kt <dig> is very likely to have at least one other orf encoding this or a similar function. in a similar way, the discrepancy between in silico essentiality prediction and in vitro observation for msba gene could be explained. the gene product of msba encodes for a transporter of phosphatidylethanolamine, which is known to have a genetic redundancy in pseudomonas sp. taking into account the pseudomonas annotation present in "the pseudomonas genome database v2". however, the supporting evidence for alternative orfs was not strong enough to be included into ijn <dig> 

finally,  <dig> genes were not predicted to be essential in ijn <dig> but they were reported as essential genes in p. aeruginosa  <cit>  . of these false negatives,  <dig> genes encode for trnas synthetases which are typically included into metabolic networks  <cit>  but are not functionally connected to the rest of the network. hence, this disagreement was expected. four additional false negative predictions, namely glya , fold , fabz , and pyrh , have at least one isozyme in kt <dig> which were also accounted for in ijn <dig>  for many remaining incorrectly predicted non-essential genes, the in silico deletion had a significant effect on the growth rate, reflecting their important roles in ijn <dig> metabolism .

in general, many of these discrepancies suggest that metabolites enabling growth in the knock-outs might be imported from the external rich media since the exact composition of lb medium is not known  <cit> . this observation indicates the importance of using well defined minimal media in the experimental in vivo or in vitro procedure to enable the usage of the generated data for in silico predictions and comparison.

gene essentiality and amino acid auxotrophy
jacobs et al. reported a detailed amino acid auxotroph study in p. aeruginosa pa <dig> using a minimal medium  <cit> . we carried out another single gene deletion study in glucose im <dig> medium and compared the results with this pa <dig> study. here, we found an absolute agreement between in vivo and in silico gene essentiality for six amino acids, namely arginine, histidine, isoleucine, valine, leucine, and tryptophan . the presence of alternative loci in ijn <dig> explains partial disagreement for arga, arge, ilva, and argj. in fact, genetic redundancy for these genes was reported in pseudomonas species  <cit> . this high correlation between in silico and in vivo data shows the utility of this approach when you take into account metabolic or anabolic reactions in a well defined minimal media. the complete lists of potential essential genes predicted in glucose im <dig> medium are listed in the additional file  <dig> 

the comparison of the in silico gene essentiality and experimental p. aeruginosa data are shown under various amino acid auxotrophic conditions. the in silico mutants were grown on glucose-im <dig> medium. * no auxotrophy was detected in ijn <dig>  genetic redundancy for these genes was reported in pseudomonas species. in p. aeruginosa mutants for orthologous genes, a significant residual growth on minimal medium was shown  <cit> . £ alternative name in p. aeruginosa. € from  <cit> .

ijn <dig> as a cell factory
in the previous section, we used the metabolic reconstruction to assess the current knowledge of p. putida's metabolism by comparing and testing in silico predictions with physiological data. however, metabolic network reconstructions can also serve as engineering and design tools  <cit>  in addition to their use for discovery purposes  <cit> . here, we investigate the poly-3-hydroxyalkanoate  production capability by the metabolic network. phas are a class of microbially produced polyesters that have the potential to replace conventional, petrochemically derived plastics in packaging and coating applications  <cit> . the biotechnological interest originates from their biodegradability and the broad range of physical properties depending on the number of carbons and side chains present in the pha polymers  <cit> . these polymers are stored by many microorganisms under inorganic nutrient limited and carbon-excess growth conditions and are used as carbon- and energy sources under starvation conditions  <cit> . the medium-side-chain phas  are composed of c <dig> to c <dig> 3-hydroxy fatty acids and are commonly produced by fluorescent pseudomonas. in this way, p. putida kt <dig> is an excellent candidate for msc-pha production studies, since i) the basic msc-pha production processes in kt <dig> are well known  <cit> , ii) its genome is completely sequenced, iii) kt <dig> has a well known metabolic versatility , iv) it is a very good host-vector biosafety system for gene cloning and expression of heterologous genes and v) this strain has been used in numerous biotechnology processes including msc-pha production.

ijn <dig> accounts for msc-phas ranging from c <dig> to c <dig>  including two unsaturated msc-phas and a mixed msc-pha polymer consisting of c <dig> to c <dig> chains. we tested the msc-pha production capability of ijn <dig> from the different carbon- and energy sources listed in table  <dig>  all carbon sources were found to result in msc-pha production under the chosen simulation condition . many of these metabolites have been reported to yield in pha production in pseudomonas  although many studies focused on fatty acid or carbohydrate derived msc-phas. in general, it is assumed that carbon sources generating high levels of acetyl-coa are good candidates for pha production  <cit> . therefore, it was not surprising to find fatty acids and carbohydrates as the best pha precursors in ijn <dig> as well . the list of candidate  precursors includes i) l-branched-chain amino acids , ii) some aromatic compounds metabolized via β-ketoadipate pathway , and iii) other  . interestingly, phenylacetic acid and glycerol have been reported as excellent precursors for pha . in fact, a recent study showed that p. putida ca <dig> can accumulate  <dig>  g of pha per g of phenylacetate  <cit> .

fatty acids resulted in the highest pha production rate overall and when scaled per carbons . in fact, fatty acids are converted into msc-phas quickly via β-oxidation  <cit> . experimental studies showed that the resulting msc-pha-monomers have the same or a smaller number of carbons as the fatty acids from which they are derived  <cit> . in contrast, in the model, higher carbon msc-phas could be formed since the current model formulation does not exclude simultaneous fatty acid synthesis and β-oxidation. this situation has been experimentally demonstrated using hexanoate as a msc-pha precursor. huijberts et al. used inhibitors of fatty acid metabolism and demonstrated that, depending on the nature of the substrate, precursors for pha synthesis could be derived from either beta-oxidation or fatty acid biosynthesis, and interestingly, when hexanoate was used as carbon source for msc-pha accumulation, both routes can operate simultaneously  <cit> . on the other hand, the carbohydrates are converted into msc-pha from intermediates of the fatty acid synthesis and have been shown to result primarily in c <dig> and c <dig> monomers. the model, in contrast, is able to produce the full range of msc-phas from carbohydrates . these discrepancies suggest that despite broad specificity of the poly- polymerase, ranging from c <dig> to c <dig> 3-hydroxy fatty acids  <cit> , the pha polymerizing enzyme system might have preferences for monomers with  <dig> or  <dig> carbon atoms, while larger and smaller monomers are incorporated less efficiently. this fact can also explain why, during growth on hexanoate, msc-pha precursors are synthesized by elongation and de novo fatty acid synthesis pathway, resulting more preferably in the generation of c <dig> and c <dig> monomers  <cit> . such differences in specific activity could be applied as additional constraints to the model to obtain similar results as those observed experimentally.

taken together, this example illustrates how ijn <dig> could be employed as a tool to identify new substrates  for production of the different msc-pha monomers or msc-pha mixtures. furthermore, computational tools such as optknock <cit>  or optstrain <cit>  could help to design i) higher production strains, and/or ii) couple pha production to growth rate. such approaches have proven successful for other metabolic engineering designs such as lactate production in e. coli  <cit>  or succinate production in m. succiniciproducens  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
here, we presented the first genome-scale reconstruction of p. putida, a biotechnologically interesting all-surrounder. ijn <dig> is a highly detailed reconstruction of the p. putida kt <dig> metabolic network that captures the important biotechnological capabilities, such as biodegradation of aromatic compounds, of this paradigmatic bacterium. moreover, ijn <dig> represents a comprehensive knowledge base summarizing and categorizing the information currently available for p. putida kt <dig>  this study evaluated the metabolic network content and showed some examples of how ijn <dig> could be used for biotechnological purposes. taken together, our results underlined the value of ijn <dig> as a suitable tool to study of p. putida's metabolism and its biotechnical applications by the p. putida community.
