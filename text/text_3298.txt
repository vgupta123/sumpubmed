BACKGROUND
nuclear hormone receptors  constitute a large family, including receptors for retinoids, thyroid  and steroid hormones. they modulate transcription by binding to their respective target along with many regulatory cofactors. nrs repress transcription on positive promoters by binding corepressors, the best known of which are n-cor and smrt  <cit> . histone deacetylases  are recruited and activated in this repressive complex, which then inactivates chromatin, thereby reducing transcription to below basal levels. ligand binding leads to an exchange between corepressors and coactivators  <cit> . several proteins bind to this primitive core complex by building interaction networks that eventually lead to activation of the chromatin by histone acetylation. interactions with basal transcription factors eventually activate rna polymerase, but similar interactions also play a role during repression.

in mammals, tacc <dig> belongs, with tacc <dig> and tacc <dig>  to the transforming acidic coiled-coil family. tacc proteins share a  <dig> amino acids c-terminal conserved coiled-coil domain , but diverge in their n-terminal part. many protein variants are derived from each of these three genes  <cit> . human tacc genes were initially described as potential cancer genes and are all present in genomic regions that are rearranged in certain cancer cells  <cit> , tacc <dig> having been first discovered as the product of an amplicon in breast cancer  <cit> . it was shown afterwards that its expression was modified in several cancers  <cit> . the first function for tacc proteins, which was subsequently well documented, lies at the level of the centrosome, where they play a role in stabilizing microtubules during formation of the mitotic spindle at mitosis  <cit> . this function is presumably a factor involved in cell transformation  <cit> . other roles for tacc proteins were recognized in the repression of xenopus oocyte translation  <cit>  and in mrna maturation  <cit> . a function for tacc proteins in transcriptional regulation was first recognized for tacc <dig>  which was described as an interaction partner and a regulator for a transcription cofactor, arnt  <cit> . since then, several studies have described interactions between a transcription cofactor, a protein belonging to a chromatin remodeling complex or rxrβ and one or several tacc proteins  <cit> . subsequent studies showed that tacc <dig> can control hematopoeitic cell differentiation through interaction with the transcription coregulator fog- <dig>  <cit>  and can relieve transcriptional repression on methylated promoters via an association with the methyl binding protein mbd <dig>  <cit> . this raises the possibility that the aberrant expression of one or more tacc proteins may affect gene regulation through their interaction with transcriptional cofactors and components of chromatin remodeling complexes, thus contributing to the oncogenic processes described above.

in this study, we looked for the putative protein partners of trα through a yeast two-hybrid assay. we identified tacc <dig> as one such partner and also found that tacc <dig> is able to bind to several unliganded nrs. through a functional assay using sirna to down-regulate tacc <dig> in animal cells we concluded that tacc <dig> participates in the overall regulatory function of tr and rar on target gene expression. moreover, we demonstrated that tacc <dig> can control tr and rar subcellular localization. our findings provide, for the first time, a general role for tacc <dig> as a cofactor in the transcriptional regulation of several nrs.

RESULTS
a mouse full-length trα <dig> cdna was used as a bait to screen a mouse cdna library. twenty five clones showing interaction with trα <dig> were obtained. sequencing revealed that they belong to eight different cdna families. six clones represented three different cdnas encoding different lengths of the c-terminal region of the protein n-cor. this result demonstrated that trα <dig> interacts with the nr corepressor in yeast whereas we  and others  <cit>  observed that this was not the case in mammalian cells. one cdna that gave an interaction was the clone y <dig>  which encoded part of the tacc <dig> protein .

tacc <dig> interacts with several nuclear receptors
we observed in a gst-pulldown assay that trα <dig> significantly interacted with the shortest human tacc1-j isoform, whereas interaction with trα <dig> appeared much weaker .

we observed that this interaction between the natural tacc1-j protein and both trα <dig> and trα <dig> isoforms also occurred in a yeast two-hybrid assay . in these cells the interaction between tacc <dig> and trα <dig> decreased when treated with t <dig>  to check for interactions between tacc <dig> products and tr isoforms in mammalian cells, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays in cos- <dig> cells co-transfected with either tacc1-k or -j cdnas and either trα <dig>  trα <dig> or trβ <dig> cdnas. clear interactions between tacc1-k and -j proteins and tr proteins were revealed . the presence of the ligand t <dig> significantly decreased the interaction with trα <dig> and trβ <dig> but, as expected, had no effect on the interaction with trα <dig> . helix  <dig> is known to participate in corepressor dismissal when t <dig> binds to trα <dig>  <cit> . indeed helix  <dig> deletion impeded t <dig> from releasing tacc1-j from trα <dig> . further experiments indicate that tacc <dig> amino acids   <dig>  and  <dig>   were essential for interaction with trα <dig> and trα <dig> in yeast . they also appeared to determine strongly or weakly the interaction in mammalian cells for both trs .

to further confirm that tacc and the tr proteins can interact in a cellular environment we investigated the localization of these products when expressed in transfected cos- <dig>  cotransfection of trα <dig> and tacc1-j wild type  or mutant  showed that part of trα <dig> colocalized with wild type tacc <dig> . the mutation of aa  <dig> and  <dig> abolished the colocalization. similar results were obtained with hela cells .

taken together, these results demonstrate that unliganded tr proteins and tacc <dig> do interact in vitro and in mammalian cells.

we tested interactions of tacc1-j through co-immunoprecipitation assays in cos- <dig> cells with several nuclear receptors including rarα, rxrα, pparγ, gr, and erα in the absence or presence of their respective ligands . all tested receptors showed a clear interaction with tacc <dig> only in the absence of their ligand. the reduction in interaction was dependent on the dose of ligand as shown for rxr and gr . overexpressed gfp-tacc1-a proteins displaced endogenous nuclear rarα .

these data suggest that interaction with tacc <dig> in mammalian cells is a shared property of several unliganded nuclear receptors of both the steroid receptor and tr families.

endogenous tacc <dig> interacts with rarα in the nucleus and is present in a nuclear chromatin-enriched fraction
we found that f <dig> embryonic carcinoma cells expressed fairly high levels of endogenous tacc <dig>  they appeared to be the best cellular model to analyse in more detail the intracellular localization of tacc <dig> and its interaction with nuclear receptors. cell fractionation revealed a strong association between tacc <dig> and the nuclear pellet . the nuclear interaction of tacc <dig> with a nuclear receptor was thus explored in co-immunoprecipitation assays in f <dig> cells stably expressing a recombinant flag-rarα. in these cells, flag-rarα protein overexpression is only  <dig> fold compared to endogenous rarα proteins . the relative amounts of flag-rarα and tacc <dig> in the supernatant versus the nuclear fraction were determined. as illustrated in figure 4a, most tacc <dig> and rarα proteins were found in the nuclear fraction of cell extracts. in the co-immunoprecipitation assays we observed that immunoprecipitation of the nuclear flag-rarα brought down the endogenous tacc <dig> protein. we conclude from these results that, in f <dig> cells, endogenous tacc <dig> does interact with rarα within the nucleus.

the interaction of tacc <dig> with nuclear receptors within the nucleus of the cell led us to speculate that tacc <dig> might be a chromatin protein. to explore this further we prepared cytosolic, soluble nuclear and chromatin-enriched fractions from f <dig> cells using a sequential high salt extraction procedure. we observed tacc <dig> to be localized in the chromatin-enriched fraction . to test the quality of the extraction procedure, we checked the distribution of histone h <dig> and rarα proteins in the two fractions . as predicted, histone h <dig> was mainly found in the chromatin-enriched fraction and rarα in both fractions. these results suggest that tacc1-rarα interactions occur at the level of the chromatin in the nuclear compartment.

tacc <dig> enhances transcriptional activation by trα and rarα
we first tried to determine the function of tacc <dig> in a functional assay. interaction was assayed with a full-length trα <dig> and a cat reporter gene under the control of a thyroid hormone response element, dr <dig>  in hela cells. neither vp <dig> nor tacc1-y11/vp <dig> alone activated the reporter . trα <dig> alone activated transcription in the presence of the hormone, as predicted. co-expression of the fusion protein tacc1-y11/vp <dig> repeatedly over-activated transcription by  <dig>  to  <dig> fold in many experiments, an effect dependent on t <dig> . these results demonstrate that a functional interaction does occur with trα <dig> on the target dr <dig> in the presence of t <dig>  the presence of vp <dig> in the fusion protein prevented us from reaching a conclusion on the function of y <dig>  so we tried to investigate the role of tacc <dig> in regulating gene expression with tacc <dig> proteins devoid of vp <dig>  however, although we designed many tacc <dig> variants, every protein mostly stayed in the cytoplasm when it was overexpressed.

we thus used an alternative strategy aimed at knocking down endogenous expression of tacc <dig> in cells in culture through rna interference using a mixture of four sirnas designed from the human tacc1-j sequences, in such a way that every tacc1-a, -k, -s, -j mrna and most of the other tacc <dig> mrnas depicted in genbank and in the literature  <cit>  should be targeted. the sirnas against human tacc <dig> were transfected into hek-293f cells or simian cos- <dig> cells. we verified that they were completely or severely depleted in the mrnas for tacc <dig> but not for tacc <dig> and tacc <dig> mrna . long tacc <dig> proteins  were totally absent . it was not possible to test the absence of the shortest proteins  with the antibody used.

we then tested, in the treated hek-293f cells, the response of a reporter gene to activation by t <dig>  the cells were co-transfected with a tr-expression plasmid and a luciferase reporter construct driven by a chicken e <dig> lysozyme thyroid hormone responsive element . in control hek-293f cells treated with a non-targeting sirna, reporter expression was activated by t <dig>  in contrast, in tacc <dig> sirna treated hek-293f cells, activation by t <dig> was decreased by 46% . in cos- <dig> cells activation by t <dig> was even more severely decreased . we also analysed in hek-293f cells the transcriptional activity of endogenous rar in response to all-trans retinoic acid  on a transfected luciferase reporter construct driven by a retinoic acid response element . activation of the reporter expression was decreased by 50% in cells treated with tacc <dig> sirnas . as controls we checked the effects of sirna on transcription induced by the oct <dig>  and ap <dig>  transcription factors. as shown in figs. 5d and 5e, down-regulating tacc <dig> in the hek-293f cells affected transactivation by these factors to a less extent. therefore the effects of tacc <dig> sirna were rather more specific to transcription by nuclear receptors.

to further investigate the role of tacc <dig> on the expression of endogenous genes under more physiological conditions, we analysed the regulation of expression of endogenous retinoic acid-target genes in cos- <dig> cells. the genes laminin b <dig>  rarβ and hoxa <dig> are known to be directly regulated by all-trans ra through rar  <cit> . we monitored their expression for  <dig> hours following atra stimulation, after two days of sirna treatment. they showed a reduced activation by atra in tacc1-deprived cells, the extent of reduction being dependent on the gene and the time of the kinetics .

we checked that in the conditions of experiments depicted on figures  <dig> and  <dig> the levels of tr and rar mrnas were not decreased . this suggests that these observations are a direct effect of the tacc <dig> knockdown.

taken together, these data show that decreases in the level of expression of tacc <dig> closely correlate with the decrease in regulating activity of tr and rar on natural target genes and thereby demonstrate that tacc <dig> is directly involved in the control of gene expression by several nrs.

interaction with tacc <dig> changes the intracellular localizations of tr
to further address the question of how tacc <dig> acts on tr function, we analysed whether the suppression of endogenous tacc <dig> protein by transfecting hek-293f cells with sirnas would alter the intracellular distribution of tr. we analysed the distribution of the fusion protein made from a gfp-trα <dig> construct in control and tacc <dig> sirna treated cells. as shown in fig 7a, in control cells the gfp-trα <dig> signal was localized exclusively within the nucleus independently of the intensity of the fluorescence. in contrast, in tacc1-deprived cells, the gfp-trα <dig> protein was partly located in the perinuclear cytoplasm in a significant proportion of the tr-expressing cells . the tacc <dig> protein might therefore be involved in tr mobilisation within the nucleus. some results suggest that it would be the same for endogenous rarα proteins.

discussion
the tacc <dig> protein and other members of the tacc protein family are known to be associated with the centrosomes and the mitotic spindle during mitosis  <cit> . other studies have shown that tacc proteins are involved in mrna translation  and could be associated with mrna maturation. we show in this study that tacc <dig> also plays a role in the control of transcription by nuclear hormone receptors and in the control of their nuclear localization. tacc <dig> physically interacts with trα <dig>  trα <dig> and trβ <dig> in yeast and mammalian cells as shown by several experimental approaches. tacc <dig> also interacts with rxrα, rarα, pparγ, erα and gr , transcription factors belonging to the two nuclear receptor families. these interactions involve only aporeceptors as ligand binding abolishes the interaction. in the light of these results and other reported interactions with transcription cofactors, it would appear that tacc proteins play an important role in transcriptional regulation.

role of tacc <dig> in transcriptional control
our present data clearly show that part if not all the tacc <dig> protein within the nucleus is associated with chromatin and that endogenous tacc <dig> interacts with tr and rar presumably within this chromatin bound fraction.

a putative role for tacc <dig> in controlling transcription by tr and rar is suggested by the effects of knocking down protein expression using sirnas. in cells deprived of tacc <dig> the ligand induced transcriptional activation of tr and rar target genes was strongly decreased. this effect was observed on a transfected reporter gene, as well as on endogenous cellular genes. this observation leads to the suggestion that tacc <dig> works as a coactivator. similar conclusions were drawn for tacc <dig> which interacts with rxrβ, on the lactoferrin promoter  <cit> .

therefore tacc <dig> is necessary for the overall regulatory activity of trs, rarα , rxrβ  <cit>  and presumably the other nrs we studied on target gene expression, but its function might be complex. what might be the mechanism of action of tacc <dig> as regards nuclear receptors? it has been shown that tacc proteins are able to physically interact with coactivators gcn <dig>  pcaf and cbp/p <dig>  and with the chromatin remodelers and regulators gas <dig>  ini- <dig> and mbd <dig>  tacc <dig> can be recruited by the latter on methylated promoters and tacc3/mbd <dig> may form a complex with hat and reactivate transcription from methylated genes  <cit> . gcn <dig> also binds to tr  <cit> . to explain how tacc <dig> could act as a coactivator in the presence of t <dig>  despite the fact it no longer interacts with tr, a coactivator  could be proposed as a bridge between tacc <dig> and trs, permitting a functional interaction without physical interaction. this can explain why we observed a functional interaction in the presence of t <dig>  as demonstrated by the effect of tacc1-y11/vp <dig> on trα <dig> on a tre. a similar behaviour has been described for other transcription cofactors such as rap <dig> and pgc- <dig>  <cit> . after coactivator binding on tacc <dig>  this protein could participate in chromatin remodelling, for example, via the ini- <dig> complex. however, tacc <dig> could be an activator in one context and a repressor in another, as shown, for example, for several coregulators such as zac <dig>  <cit> . although our rna interference results focus on its role in activation, we cannot exclude the possibility that it plays a role in the repression complex on positive response elements because, in the absence of ligands, tacc <dig> physically interacts with several nrs including rxr, the common partner to all non-steroid receptors. an interaction between taccs and rxrβ in the absence of ligand has also been observed  <cit> . tacc <dig> interactions with both partners on tres or rares could contribute to building the corepressor complex. heldring et al. proposed that n-cor and smrt would be recruited to erα via indirect mechanisms that require additional factors  <cit> . tacc <dig> could be one of these factors. it remains to be determined if tacc <dig> interacts with corepressors or hdacs. moreover, the sirnas used were designed to destroy mrnas of tacc1-a, -k, -s and -j variants, but they could also knock down most mrna isoforms present in the cells. the effect we observed on trα <dig> transcription resulted from the absence of tacc1-a and k proteins, but presumably of many other proteins such as tacc1-s and -j, which the antibody used could not reveal. we cannot exclude the possibility that one of the other isoforms could be a true corepressor. for comparison, n-cor is a paradigm for corepressors but its natural splice variant n-cori is a potent coactivator for unliganded tr  <cit> . these results, taken as a whole, lead to the suggestion that tacc <dig> has a dual function and that it is a scaffold protein that organises transcription in nr-complexes. the same conclusion was independently reached by vettaikkorumakankauv et al  <cit> .

one important observation was that, in tacc <dig> deprived cells, trα <dig> and presumably rarα were delocalized from the nucleus to the perinuclear cytoplasm. this suggests that tacc <dig> is directly involved in controlling the nuclear localization of both nrs or in regulating the trafficking of these nrs within the chromatin and thereby their availability to target genes. thus the reduced transcriptional activity mediated by these nrs in tacc1-deprived cells might partly result from this nuclear delocalization. its importance would depend on the balance between what is displaced in the cytoplasm and what remains in the nucleus. the converse situation is that overexpressed tacc <dig> can displace endogenous rar from the nucleus, presumably by interaction in the cytoplasm, as shown by colocalization experiments with tr. similarly, overexpressed aint  displaced the endogenous nuclear transcription cofactor arnt  <cit>  and overexpressed tacc <dig> modulates a transcriptional response of c-fos and c-jun genes  <cit> . all these results suggest that some tacc <dig> action on transcription modulation is indirect and takes place from the cytoplasm. it could occur in pathological situations when tacc <dig> is abnormally present in the cytoplasm or depleted  <cit>  in the cell, or under normal situations, as described for tacc <dig>  it maintains the coregulator fog- <dig> in the cytoplasm during the undifferentiated state of hematopoietic cells, the terminal differentiation occurring when tacc <dig> expression is weak, allowing fog- <dig> to activate the transcription factor gata- <dig>  <cit> .

tacc <dig> as a multifunctional protein and a transforming protein
tacc <dig> appears to be a multifunctional protein similar to many other coregulators  <cit> . it could work as a scaffold protein organizing different functions around itself. in particular it plays a role in building a structure, the centrosome, and in controlling a function, transcription. a model for such proteins is β-catenin, which forms part of adherens junctions and is a transcription cofactor for tcf/lef. it has been recently demonstrated that g-actin, a cytoskeleton component when polymerized, regulates gene expression and participates in chromatin remodelling  <cit> . this sheds light on how the cell can coordinate morphology and transcription. tacc <dig> might behave in a similar manner, coordinating transcriptional control by several nrs, as well as mitosis.

tacc proteins are involved in several cancers such as mammary, ovarian and gastric cancers, and in leukemia. however their role as oncogenes  <cit>  or tumour suppressors  <cit>  has not yet been clarified, as tacc proteins are over- or underexpressed, depending on the tumour cell lines and primary tumours  <cit> . therefore mutations in the structure and function of tacc <dig> in tumours could mislocalize the protein in a cell subcompartment or deplete one of them. the discovery of tacc interactions with several nrs and previous descriptions of interactions with transcription cofactors has led to the assumption that pathological alterations in the level of expression of tacc <dig> or in its localization could directly and indirectly affect transcriptional regulation of these nr target genes. for example, it has been described that in the normal human prostate tissue tacc <dig> is located in the nucleus  <cit>  whereas it is cytoplasmic in prostate adenocarcinomas  <cit> . it could thereby contribute to oncogenic development, as described for other transcription coregulators  <cit> . it is worth noting that alterations in tacc <dig> have been found in breast cancers, a type of tumour whose development is known to be controlled by estrogen receptors. the initial description of tacc <dig> comes from the study of an amplicon associated with er-positive lobular carcinomas that metastasize to axillary lymph nodes  <cit> . if amplification in 8p <dig> is associated with an overexpression of the tacc <dig> protein, our results suggest that this could perturb the transcription of er target genes, with consequences for tumorigenesis or the metastasis process. it is interesting that tacc <dig> has been recognized as the strongest prognostic marker associated with endocrine therapy resistance in breast tumours  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
tacc proteins are well-known actors for the mitotic spindle stabilization and the centrosome function  <cit> . their role in transcription control is far less documented. focusing on some nuclear hormone receptors , we show for the first time that tacc <dig> plays a role in transcription. the mechanism appears complex as tacc <dig> behaves as a coactivator since its absence precludes full activation of thyroid hormone t <dig> and retinoic acid-dependent promoters, while the interaction between the studied nrs and tacc <dig> occurs in the absence of their respective ligands. overexpression and underexpression have consequences on the subcellular localization of tr and rar. by its dual function, building the mitotic spindle and regulating transcription, tacc <dig> might play a role in coordinating the mitosis and transcription. the transforming properties of this protein when misexpressed or mislocalized might be due not only to defects of the spindle but also directly from action on transcription.
