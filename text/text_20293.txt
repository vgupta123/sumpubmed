BACKGROUND
serotoninergic 5-ht <dig> receptors belong to the family of 7-membrane spanning receptors coupled to gs protein. until now  <dig> different human isoforms have been cloned and sequenced , , , , , , , ,  and )  <cit>  they are all coded by a complex gene , which generates  <dig> carboxy-terminal variants issued from alternative splicing. they have identical sequences up to leu <dig>  with the exception of h5-ht <dig>  which is characterized by a  <dig> amino acid residues insertion within the receptor second extracellular loop  of h5-ht <dig>  <cit> . the presence of 5-ht <dig> receptor has been reported in different tissues. receptor mrna has been detected in brain, bladder, gastrointestinal tract, heart, kidney, pancreas and testis  <cit> . in postmortem human brain studies the receptor, ignoring its different isoforms, was detected in the basal ganglion , in cortex and hippocampus   <cit> . in heart, mrna for different h5-ht <dig> isoforms is mainly detected in atrium , , , , )  <cit> . the presence of four isoforms, mainly m5-ht <dig>  , ,  has been described in mouse  <cit> . although many studies have been performed to highlight the tissue distribution and functional activity of different isoforms of the receptor in adult human, rat and mouse, little is known about their expression and function during embryogenesis. previously we have reported the involvement of 5-ht <dig> receptor in congenital heart block  associated to a systemic autoimmune response in the mother  <cit> . in neonatal lupus erythematosus , autoantibodies against ribonucleoproteins 48-kda ssb/la, 52-kda ssa/ro  and 60-kda ssa/ro  have received more attention, since they have been shown to be strongly associated with autoimmune responses involved in symptoms like chb  <cit> . it has been postulated that the transfer of maternal anti-ro <dig> antibodies from mother to the fetus is responsible for the symptoms of nle. in a previous study, we managed to induce nle symptoms in a mouse model  <cit> . this has prompted us to further explore the expression of different 5-ht <dig> receptor isoforms in balb/c mice during embryogenesis. meanwhile, we searched for the period when anti-receptor antibodies could induce the observed abnormalities.

RESULTS
 <dig>  production of anti-peptide antibodies
peptides derived from c-terminal ends of 5-ht <dig> receptor isoforms  were highly immunogenic. the anti-5-ht <dig> and 5-ht <dig> antibodies were able to recognize both their homologue peptide in elisa. the specificity of the recognition was tested by inhibition immunoassay . no cross-reactivity between the different anti-isoforms antibodies was detected in elisa . the antibodies recognized their corresponding receptor isoforms in immunocytofluorescence performed on transfected cho cells . on transfected cho cells, anti- 5-ht <dig> antibodies were specific for their corresponding isoform while anti-5-ht <dig> ones recognized 5-ht <dig>  ,  and  isoforms.

 <dig>  expression of receptor isoforms
embryos from  <dig> pregnant balb/c mice gestation days  8th, 12th, 16th, 18th, 20th and one day postnatal  were collected. these were used to explore the expression of 5-ht <dig> receptor isoforms both at the mrna  and protein levels. rt-pcr experiments revealed the increased expression of 5-ht <dig> receptor isoforms from day  <dig> of gestation to day  <dig> postnatal in brain. receptor mrna expression in the heart decreased gradually and disappeared at birth . the latter was confirmed at the protein level where the expression of both isoforms matched the expressed 5-ht <dig> receptor mrna . in adult mouse brain we detected both anti-5-ht <dig> and anti-5-ht <dig>  interestingly, the 5-ht <dig> receptor is absent in dentate gyrus of adult mouse hippocampus .

 <dig>  in vivo effect of anti-5-ht <dig> antibodies
in order to highlight the role of 5-ht <dig> receptor on normal development of the embryos, we sought to immunomodulate the activity of the receptor in balb/c mice embryos, through the passage of maternal anti-receptor antibodies induced with a peptide corresponding to the second extracellular loop of the 5-ht <dig> receptor. pregnant mice at 8th, 12th, 18th gd and one dpn were sacrificed and the embryos were counted and collected for morphological studies.

all female mice immunized with g21v developed high-titre anti-peptide antibodies. serum from the mouse having a fetus with spina bifida, recognized the 5-ht <dig> receptor by flow cytometry analyses performed on cho cells transfected with 5-ht <dig> receptor . the same antibodies did not recognize any expression protein on ch <dig> cells transfected with m <dig> muscarinic receptor. although immunized mice were all pregnant between  <dig> to  <dig> days post-mating, no pups were delivered at 21st day post-fertility. mice had to be mated more than three times over a period of  <dig> months for a successful pregnancy. this was probably due to the presence of anti-5-ht <dig> receptor antibodies. the fact that the female balb/c mice had circulating anti-peptide antibodies did not alter their fertility but jeopardized the normal development of embryos. the latter was confirmed by the abnormal number of embryos collected at different periods of gestation. in addition we have also observed and documented different symptoms such as growth delay, spina bifida, arrhythmia and ataxia, which all started from the 12th gestation day to  <dig> day pn . control mice  gave birth to normal number of pups  <dig> days after the first mating . the number of fetus in different embryonic periods was also normal i.e.  <dig> embryo in average . no abnormalities were observed neither in the embryos nor in the fetuses of the control did female mice, which were administer only cfa and mbsa.

summary of the outcome at different development intervals from female balb/c mice immunized with g21v peptide. there is a relation between anti-g21v antibodies titre and number of fetuses/pups.

morphological studies showed either growth delay or late development of foetal hindbrain at 12th gd . histological studies showed, besides the presence of spina bifida, delayed foetal neuronal differentiation in embryos from the mother with circulating anti-5-ht <dig> antibodies. in the heart of the same embryo symmetric form of the heart was observed with pronounced hyperplasia and decreased fibroblast density . the latter was confirmed with decreased immunoreactivity for α-sma in the heart of the embryos from the mouse with circulating anti-5-ht <dig> antibodies 

CONCLUSIONS
up to now there is no information on the distribution of the 5-ht <dig> receptor isoforms at the protein level. the fact that there are at least  <dig> different 5-ht <dig> receptor isoforms and mrna expression in both central and peripheral organs, point to the importance of this family of receptors in the maintenance of normal cellular activity. although 5-ht <dig> receptor has been reported to be involved in memory and learning as well as gastrointestinal function, less or almost nothing is known about its role in embryogenesis.

the importance of the embryonic serotoninergic system in central nervous and cardiovascular functions has been largely described  <cit> . in early mouse embryogenesis, maternal serotonin  activates different 5-ht receptors to control gene expression, migration and proliferation of neuronal crest and neuronal-crest derived cells  <cit> . although there is enough evidence fortifying the 5-ht hypothesis in embryogenesis, no major abnormalities were found in 5-ht <dig> receptor knockout mice. one has just observed an attenuated response to stress and novelty as well as hypersensitivity to seizures  <cit> . there are many knockout and transgenic mouse models with such phenotypes. for instance null mutation of α <dig> subunit nicotinic cholinergic receptor increases the susceptibility to proconvulsant-induced seizures  <cit> . this is also the case for 5-ht1a receptor, prion protein, superoxide dismutase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha  <cit>  and many others. blocking the expression

of 5-ht receptors using traditional knockout method gives rise to compensatory mechanism that occur during the constitutive deletion of the receptor throughout the lifespan of the animal. furthermore, the inherent complexity in the pattern of expression and in the function of some genes and gene products contributes more to compensation and hidden developmental roles  <cit> . on the contrary by using alternative methods like blocking the expression of the receptor in restricted periods of time one circumvents the compensations  <cit> . the latter is also possible by modulating the protein activity at the cell membrane rather than blocking the function of the gene. given the pathophysiological complexity of these conditions and involvement of many other factors one cannot explain these abnormal conditions with the lack of 5-ht <dig> receptors. one plausible explanation to the latter is the expanded variety of the 5-ht receptor family. loosing one receptor subtype or isoform probably leads to a compensation mechanism conducted by other members of the family here probably 5-ht <dig> serotoninergic receptor. the only 5-ht receptor knockout with pathophysiological consequences is the 5-ht <dig> receptor. 5-ht <dig> receptor knockout mice embryos developed cardiac hypoplasia  <cit> . the receptor's importance in regulating cardiac activity was reported two years later  <cit> . our group has shown in pups of balb/c mice that maternal anti-5-ht <dig> antibodies caused fetal cardiac hyperplasia and arrhythmia  <cit> . in the central nervous system, 5-ht <dig> receptor isoform mrnas were found in almost all brain structures. however, up to now neither the receptor expression nor its function during the fetal period was studied.

in the first part of this study, we demonstrated the specificity of the anti-peptide antibodies for their corresponding peptide. anti-5ht <dig> was specific for its isoform as it did not cross react with any of the other receptor isoforms tested, i.e. 5-ht <dig>   and . on the contrary, 5-ht <dig> antibodies, besides binding its corresponding peptide could also recognize all the other isoforms including 5-ht <dig>  this was not due to a cross reactivity but to their specificity, since the c- terminal end of 5-ht <dig> is common between 5-ht <dig>  ,  and . we report here the presence of cardiac isoforms 5-ht <dig> in embryos from balb/c mice at gd 8th , 12th, 18th and one day postnatal. since the anti-5-ht <dig> antibodies are able to recognize other already mentioned isoforms, we can only be sure about the expression of 5-ht <dig> in the heart and brain. whether there are other isoforms expressed during embryogenesis remains elusive. however 5-ht <dig> receptor was found both in fetal brain and heart. both 5-ht <dig> and 5-ht <dig> receptor isoforms were expressed in brain, at  <dig> dp, but we could not detect any signal in the pups' heart for the two explored isoforms. one remains, however, puzzled of the receptor's disappearance at  <dig> dp. this could be explained by the progressive appearance of adrenergic receptors. indeed, both α- and β-adrenergic receptors are already detected at 12th gd, and, contrary to 5-ht <dig> receptor, activity of β-adrenergic receptor in mouse heart increases significantly until birth  <cit> .

in the second part of our study, we observed that all female balb/c mice immunized with peptide derived from the second extracellular loop of 5-ht <dig> receptor developed anti-peptide antibodies that could recognize membranes from 5-ht <dig> transfected cho cells. although the mice were all fertile, they had to be mated several times before developing a successful pregnancy. all mice in the control group gave birth  <dig> days post mating. in immunized mice, the number of pups for the first pregnancy was between  <dig> and  <dig>  which was similar to the control group. however, the number of fetuses of immunized mice decreased from 12th to 18th gd . this was in accordance with the titer of circulating antibodies in the mothers. the latter was also observed in two littermates, where one mouse gave birth to  <dig> and the other to  <dig> pups. here we observed again that the titer of circulating antibodies for the mother with just two pups was  <dig> times higher than the mouse with  <dig> pups.

in this study, we demonstrated that 5-ht <dig> receptors are expressed already at the 8th gd , at least for the 5-ht <dig> isoform. we also provided evidence for the functionality of the anti-receptor antibodies, since 1) they decreased fertility as shown by the increased number of mating for a successful litter, 2) they decreased the number of fetuses and pups in relation with the titer of circulating antibodies, 3) they induced morphological and functional abnormalities both in peripheral and central organs. in our earlier study  <cit>  we demonstrated that anti-5-ht <dig> antibodies passively transferred from mother to the pups could induce atrioventricular block type i and ii , tremor and skin lesions. here we confirmed the presence of malformation in some cases and could correlate its incidence with the expression of the receptor and titre of the anti-receptor antibodies. this means that at high concentration of transferred anti-receptor antibodies the chance of malformation is considerably higher, since 21-days post mating either the number of pups decreased or no labour was issued. the effect of anti-5-ht <dig> antibodies could be through their binding to at least 5-ht <dig> receptor isoform, since it is already expressed from 8th gd. it has been shown that antibodies against the second extracellular loop of the receptor block the effect of serotonin in human cardiomyocytes  <cit> . in embryonic heart muscle expression of vascular α-actin has been demonstrated. alpha-actin acts as a precursor in immature contractile structures, when the embryonic heart just starts to beat, and might only gradually be replaced by the mature cardiac isoform  <cit> . for this reason we used α-smooth muscle actin as a marker for heart development. our observation that myocardium of mouse fetus with circulating maternal anti-5-ht <dig> antibodies has less or no immunoreactivity for α-actin smooth muscle could be due to delayed maturation of fetal myocardium in immunized animals. however although the presences of anti-ro <dig> autoantibodies cross reacting with sel of 5-ht <dig> receptors shows a good correlation with the prevalence for neonatal lupus their pathogenic role cannot be generalized. we have shown this in our previous work  <cit> . this could be due to at one hand that the tested sera were from pretreated pregnant women with lupus. in no studies yet published the blood samples are collected following the same period of pregnancy. beside the important fluctuation of circulating autoantibodies makes the exploration even harder. on the other hand we don't have any idea about the expression of the 5-ht <dig> receptor during human embryogenesis. therefore we cannot draw any general conclusion. in mice  with no known autoimmune genetic background, therefore requiring no treatment, only the presence of 5-ht <dig> receptor antibodies induced anomalies in fetus, which coincide with the receptor expression. here we could postulate that the sel of 5-ht <dig> receptor could be a pathogenic target for autoantibodies

although the effect of the antibodies seems to be through the inhibition of the serotonin signal we however have no evidence for its cellular mechanism.

finally, we also show that immunomodulation of 5-ht <dig> receptor activity, during embryogenesis, is an honorable alternative to the gene knockout technique. since the receptor is already expressed and functional, modulating or inhibiting its activity will not activate any genetically compensatory mechanism. therefore, its activity and physiological role can be explored independently.

taken together, our results demonstrate that 5-ht <dig> receptors are crucial for embryonic development of the cardiovascular and central nervous systems in balb/c mice. coincidence of anti-receptor antibodies and expression of 5-ht <dig> receptor results in anatomical abnormalities. further studies are needed to highlight the function of different receptor isoforms during embryogenesis.
