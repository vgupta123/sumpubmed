BACKGROUND
an inflammatory process in the central nervous system  is considered to be a prominent feature in a number of neurodegenerative diseases and is mediated by the activated microglia, the resident immune cells of the cns. the microglia normally respond to neuronal damage and remove the damaged cells by phagocytosis  <cit> . the chronic activation of these cells appears to cause neuronal damage through enhanced release of potentially cytotoxic molecules such as proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α  and interleukin-1β , nitric oxide , reactive oxygen intermediates, proteinases and complement proteins  <cit> . moreover, microglia-derived free radicals as well as the reactive reaction products, hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite, have the potential to harm cells and have been implicated in contributing to oxidative damage and neurodegeneration in neurological diseases  <cit> . therefore, suppression of microglia-mediated inflammation has been considered as an important strategy in neurodegenerative disease therapy.

nicotinamide adenine dinuceotide phosphate  oxidase, a multi-component enzyme complex is an important source of reactive oxygen species  in respiratory oxidative stress and intracellular signaling pathways  <cit> . nadph oxidase has been shown to be involved in the innate immune response by killing microbes through generation of ros. nox family is a subunit component of nadph oxidases that generate superoxide and other downstream ros. among them, nox- <dig> , is expressed in the neuron and glial cells including microglia  <cit>  and regulates nadph oxidase activities by stabilizing p22phox  to form its membrane component. nox-dependent ros generation has been shown to regulate the production of cytokines and chemokines as well as other proinflammatory molecules  <cit> . due to its expression in microglia and ability to generate large amounts of ros, nox protein is thus considered to be critical for ros induction in activated microglia  <cit> .

recent studies have demonstrated that activated microglia are important sources of ros and reactive nitrogen species  in the brain and involved in neuroinflammation processes in neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . abundant existence of ros has been found to be associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinson's disease and alzheimer's disease  <cit> . it has also been reported that large amount of nitric oxide  production catalyzed by inducible no synthase  may contribute to cellular damage in the cns  <cit> . furthermore, attempts made to restrict the oxidative stress have been proven to be of beneficial to patients with neurodegenerative disorders. these pieces of evidence indicate that limiting oxidative stress is an important step in controlling neurodegenerative diseases.

glucocorticoids , the endogenous immunosuppressors for the innate immune response and the subsequent inflammatory reaction, have been shown to enhance the survival of several phagocytic cells by suppressing intracellular ros production and inhibiting ros-induced apoptosis  <cit> . dexamethasone , a synthetic glucocorticoid, has also been demonstrated to inhibit inos expression and no production in lps-induced macrophages  <cit> .

mitogen activated protein kinase  pathways are important signaling cascades that mediate several cellular functions by relaying extracellular signals to key intracellular molecules  <cit> . it has been previously shown that the induction of the mapk pathways leads to microglial activation by transcription of tnfα, cox- <dig> and mcp- <dig>  <cit> . three particular mapk pathways - p <dig>  jun n-terminal kinase  and extracellular signal-regulated kinase  pathways have been shown to be regulated by gc via activating the expression of mapk phosphatase- <dig>   <cit> . we have demonstrated that dex suppresses microglia-involved inflammation by inhibiting production of monocyte chemoattractant protein- <dig> , a chemokine and subsequent migration of microglia via mapk phosphatase- <dig>  dependent suppression of p <dig> and jnk mapk pathways in activated microglia  <cit> . however the effect of dex on ros production and its possible regulatory mechanism in activated microglia remains to be demonstrated. in this study, we demonstrate that dex inhibits ros production by downregulating the expression of nox- <dig> and by mkp- <dig> dependent suppression of p <dig> and jnk mapk pathways. these results reveal new mechanisms by which dex attenuates ros which may be helpful in developing therapeutic strategies for minimizing oxidative stress mediated neurodegeneration in cns diseases.

RESULTS
lps alters the ros production and nox- <dig> protein expression in bv- <dig> microglial cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner
ros production in the bv- <dig> microglial cells treated with different concentrations of lps  was estimated in order to choose the optimum dose of lps for further studies. although the ros production in bv- <dig> cells appeared to be induced by all the concentrations of lps used, a significant increase in ros production was observed in bv- <dig> cells treated with 1- <dig>  μg/ml of lps . however, the significant increase in ros production was found to be declined in cells when the lps concentration was increased to  <dig>  μg/ml. subsequently, the bv- <dig> microglial cells were treated with  <dig> μg/ml of lps for different time points . the ros production in lps-activated bv- <dig> cells was progressively increased with time, peaked at  <dig> h and declined thereafter . further, the protein expression of nox- <dig> was found to be increased maximally in bv- <dig> cells treated with lps at  <dig> μg/ml for  <dig> h . thus we chose to treat bv- <dig> cells with lps at  <dig> μg/ml for  <dig> h for the rest of the studies.

dexamethasone suppresses the lps-induced nox- <dig> expression in microglia in vivo and in vitro
expression of nox- <dig> was examined immunohistochemically both in vivo and in vitro. in normal and dex treated 3d postnatal rat pups, a considerable number of lectin-positive microglial cells were found to be distributed in the corpus callosum of the brain, and majority of them were colocalized with nox- <dig> . the frequency of these cells was markedly increased in the brain of pups which received lps injection ; however, injection of dex decreased the incidence of these cells . in vitro, the expression of nox- <dig> was greatly increased in majority of the bv- <dig> cells exposed to lps for  <dig> h , compared to untreated cells . following treatment of dex at  <dig>  μm  and  <dig> μm , the nox- <dig> immunoreactivity was noticeably decreased in lps-activated bv- <dig> cells. the size of activated bv- <dig> cells appeared to be increased and the size was reduced with the addition of dex .

dexamethasone and inhibitors of p <dig> and jnk mapk pathways suppress the ros production in activated bv- <dig> cells
the effect of dex on ros production in lps-treated bv- <dig> cells was examined by flow cytometry using cm-h2dcfda as the fluorescent probe. the fluorescence intensity represents the amount of ros production in the cells. incubation with lps  for  <dig> h significantly increased the ros production in bv- <dig> cells, when compared to that in untreated cells . however, pretreatment with dex at different concentrations ,  <dig> min prior to incubation with lps prevented the increase of ros production significantly in bv- <dig> cells . the inhibitory effect on ros production in activated bv- <dig> cells was augmented with the increase in dex concentrations. on the other hand, dex alone at different concentrations did not alter ros production in bv- <dig> cells significantly, when compared with that in the control .

to examine whether the mapk signaling pathways are involved in the induction of ros production in activated bv- <dig> cells, the cells were incubated with the inhibitors of p <dig>  and jnk  mapks,  <dig> min prior to the addition of lps. flow cytometric and quantitative analysis revealed that the ros production was significantly decreased in the lps-stimulated bv- <dig> cells exposed to either p <dig> or jnk inhibitors .

dexamethasone and inhibitors of p <dig> and jnk mapk pathways suppress inos expression in microglial cells treated with lps
a major source of reactive nitrogen intermediates is inducible nitric oxide synthase , an enzyme expressed in activated microglia during inflammation. expression of inos protein was hardly detectable in microglia found in the corpus callosum of  <dig> day old rat brain  and the untreated bv- <dig> cells in vitro . there was marked induction of inos in the activated microglial cells in vivo and bv <dig> cells treated with lps . the activated cells appeared to be hypertrophic and showed abundant cytoplasm that was intensely labeled with inos immunoreactivity, when compared with untreated cells. however, dex  treatment reduced the inos immunoreactivity in activated microglial and bv <dig> cells . dex alone did not induce the expression of inos in microglial cells in vivo and bv <dig> cells in vitro .

real time rt-pcr analysis showed that dex  decreased the induction of inos mrna expression level in lps-activated bv- <dig> cells  in which, the inos mrna level was found to be elevated by about  <dig> folds in comparison to that of the untreated cells. there was no significant change in inos mrna expression level in bv- <dig> cells treated with different concentrations of dex alone, when compared to that in the control . nitrite assay revealed that the induction of no release in activated bv- <dig> cells by lps was attenuated significantly when the cells were exposed to dex together with lps . interestingly, real time-rtpcr analysis showed that the inos mrna expression level was decreased by pretreatment with inhibitors of p <dig> and jnk  in activated bv- <dig> cells, suggesting that p <dig> and jnk mapk pathways are involved in lps-induced inos expression .

dexamethasone suppresses p <dig> and jnk mapk pathways in bv- <dig> microglial cells treated with lps
it has been previously shown that dex inhibits the lps-induced activation of map kinases in primary microglial cultures  <cit> . in this study, western blot analysis showed that the lps treatment at different time points induced the phosphorylation of jnk  and p <dig>  significantly in bv- <dig> cells. maximum induction was observed at  <dig> h after lps treatment. however, expression level of both phospho-p <dig> and phospho-jnk declined to the basal level at  <dig> h after incubation with lps. the induction of phosphorylation of both jnk  and p <dig>  in bv- <dig> cells treated with lps for  <dig> h was suppressed dose-dependently by the pretreatment of the cells with dex.

dexamethasone suppresses nox- <dig> expression via p <dig> and jnk mapk pathways in bv- <dig> microglial cells treated with lps
since nox protein is considered to be critical in ros production in activated microglia  <cit> , we examined if dex inhibits ros production by acting on the nox- <dig> expression in activated bv- <dig> cells. incubation of lps for  <dig> h significantly induced the nox- <dig> protein expression level in bv- <dig> cells when compared with untreated cells . the lps-induced nox- <dig> expression was markedly suppressed by the addition of dex  in the culture and the inhibition was augmented with the increase in dex concentrations . real time rt-pcr results also showed that incubation of bv- <dig> cells with lps for  <dig> h significantly induced nox- <dig> mrna expression and the increase was suppressed if the cells were pre-incubated with dex . next, we examined whether the inhibitory effect of dex on nox- <dig> is mediated via mapks pathways. inhibitors of jnk and p <dig> showed a significant suppressive effect on nox- <dig> protein expression in activated bv- <dig> cells . real time rt-pcr also showed that mrna expression of nox- <dig> was significantly suppressed by inhibitors of jnk and p <dig> in lps treated bv- <dig> cells .

knockdown of nox- <dig> gene suppresses the lps-induced ros generation and no release in bv <dig> microglial cells
knockdown of endogenous nox- <dig> in bv- <dig> cells  by sequence specific sirna  suppressed the ros generation in control cells and prevented the lps-induced ros production in comparison to both control and scrambled sirna  treated cells  and no release .

overexpression of mkp- <dig> suppresses nox- <dig> mrna expression in bv- <dig> microglial cells
since mapks pathways regulate nox- <dig> expression and ros production, we examined the role of mkp- <dig> in the regulation of nox- <dig> by overexpressing mkp- <dig> in bv- <dig> cells. mkp- <dig> was localized in the microglia in the rat corpus callosum by immuofluorescence staining . in brain sections of normal 3-day old and  <dig> weeks old postnatal rats that received saline injection  or dex injection , mkp- <dig> was hardly detectable in microglial cells distributed in the corpus callosum. however, microglia in the brains of rats that received lps  or lps plus dex injection showed marked induction of mkp- <dig> immunoreactivity . a similar immunoexpression pattern of mkp- <dig> was observed in bv- <dig> cells . real time rt-pcr results showed that mkp- <dig> mrna expression level was significantly increased about  <dig> folds in lps-treated bv- <dig> cells and about  <dig> folds in mkp-1- transfected  bv- <dig> cells when compared to that in untreated cells . in contrast, the mrna expression level of nox- <dig> was significantly reduced in mkp-1+ bv- <dig> cells compared to that in untreated cells, and lps treatment did not induce nox- <dig> mrna expression level in mkp-1+ bv- <dig> cells . moreover, nitrite assay also revealed that lps did not induce the release of no in mkp-1+ bv- <dig> cells treated with lps .

on the other hand, knockdown of mkp- <dig>  with sequence specific sirna  significantly increased the ros production  and no release  by bv- <dig> cells exposed to lps with or without dex, in comparison to that of controls.

discussion
activated microglial cells by neurodegenerative stimulus undergo a defined pattern of physiological changes and release a number of proinflammatory cytokines  and chemokines  that contribute to neuropathogenesis in cns inflammation  <cit> . in addition, these cells release free radicals such as superoxide, ros and no. excessive production of ros and reactive nitrogen species  by activated microglia, has the potential to harm neighboring healthy cells  and is the main cause of oxidative stress in the nervous system, leading to neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer's disease  <cit> . therefore, suppression of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity has been considered as an important strategy in neurodegenerative disease therapy. several drugs have been shown to alleviate symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases by suppressing the inflammatory response of microglial cells. however, chronic use of these drugs is often associated with debilitating side effects, and none seems to restrain the progression of these diseases. it is suggested that downstream targets of these drugs may limit the side effects of those drugs in clinical setting.

dexamethasone, a synthetic immunosuppressor has been shown to suppress ros production, no release as well as inflammatory reaction of activated microglial cells  <cit> . however, the mechanisms by which dex suppresses ros production and no release remained unclear. the present study showed that the increased ros production and no release in activated microglia were associated with increased expression of nox- <dig>  and inos, which are the major sources of ros and reactive nitrogen intermediates respectively, in activated microglia. the expression of nox- <dig> has been localized in neurons and glial cells including microglia  <cit>  and its upregulation and subsequent ros production in activated microglia were found to be suppressed by dex. moreover, dex has been shown to provide neuroprotection by inhibiting inos expression as well as no synthesis in activated microglia  <cit> . hence it is suggested that dex suppresses the production of ros and no release, and subsequently neuronal oxidative damage by inhibiting the expression of nox- <dig> as well as inos in activated microglia. the inhibition of nox- <dig> by dex observed in activated microglia appears to be mediated by mkp- <dig> dependent suppression of mapks, since the overexpression of mkp- <dig> and inhibition of mapks downregulate the expression of nox- <dig> in activated microglia.

nox-dependent ros generation has been shown to induce the expression of tnf-α  <cit> , tgf-β <dig>  and mcp- <dig> through map kinase activation  <cit>  or through transcription factors, including nfκb, ap- <dig> and p <dig>  which contain redox-sensitive, low-pka cysteine residues in their dna binding domain  <cit> . the nox-dependent ros generation by microglia has also been implicated in a variety of cns diseases including stroke  <cit> , ischemic brain injury  <cit> , demyelinating disease  <cit>  and inflammatory neurodegeneration, including alzheimer's disease  and parkinson's disease  <cit> . hence, suppression of nox-dependent ros generation may form a better therapeutic strategy for neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases.

microglial response to extracellular stimuli is mediated by kinase and phosphatase cascades. several reports have demonstrated that p <dig> and p44/ <dig> families of mapk pathways play a significant role in activation of microglial cells which in turn leads to release of neurotoxic molecules and neuroinflammation in acute brain injury such as stroke and in chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as ad  <cit> . recently, we have demonstrated that jnk and p <dig> mapks in activated microglia contribute to the induction of mcp- <dig>  a chemokine which promotes the migration of microglia leading to amplification of the inflammation process in the injury site  <cit> . glucocorticoids  or dex have been consistently shown to inhibit the expression of proinflammatory genes by antagonizing the mapk pathways, in particular the p <dig> and jnk pathways. the inhibition of mapk pathways is mediated via induction of mkp- <dig>  <cit> . several proinflammatory stimuli, such as lps and neuromodulators such as endocannabinoid anandamide also induce mkp- <dig> expression which, however, activates a negative feedback loop down-regulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and neurotoxic molecules such as tnf-α, il- <dig> and il- <dig>  mcp- <dig> and no  <cit> . the induction of mkp- <dig> has been shown to be a survival mechanism against oxidative damage in cancer cell lines  <cit> . our study supports the notion that dex inhibits jnk and p <dig> phosphorylation in microglial cells by inducing mkp- <dig> expression, which in turn negatively regulates the proinflammatory response and chemotactic effect of activated microglia  <cit> .

more recently, ros has been shown to inhibit mkp- <dig> activation causing activation of jnk, which contributes to pancreatic beta-cell death  <cit>  and to function as an upstream regulator of jnk/sapk and p <dig> mapk  <cit> . on the contrary, mkp- <dig> activation by dex in activated microglia appears to limit the oxidative damage by suppressing nox-dependent ros production. interestingly, overexpression and sirna analyses of mkp- <dig> clearly reveal that inhibition of nox-dependent ros production by dex in activated microglia is mediated via upregulation of mkp- <dig>  indicating a complex link between ros production and mkp- <dig> phosphorylation in activated microglia. moreover, this paradox could be due to the different metabolic mechanisms in different cell types.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, the overexpression of mkp- <dig> in microglia may be considered as the possible therapeutic option as it suppresses the ros-mediated neurotoxicity caused by activated microglia in neurodegenerative diseases. however, further studies involving appropriate animal models are required to determine mkp <dig> as the possible therapeutic target, since the influence of other microenvironmental factors on microglial activation cannot be excluded.
