BACKGROUND
membrane proteins are a large fraction  of all the proteins found in living organisms  <cit> . knowledge of the location of transmembrane  segments can be useful in narrowing down the possible tertiary structure conformations for the given protein  <cit> , and in the prediction of function  <cit> . the number of tm proteins with experimentally determined structure corresponds to only about  <dig> % out of about  <dig>  protein structures deposited to date in the protein data bank , making it desirable and necessary to predict the structure by computational sequence analysis.

all of the tm helix prediction methods make use of two fundamental characteristics:  the length of the tm helix being at least  <dig> residues so that it is long enough to cross the  <dig> Å thick hydrophobic core of the bilayer  <cit> , and  the tm residues being hydrophobic for reasons of thermodynamic stability in the membrane environment  <cit> . for transmembrane helix prediction without the use of evolutionary information, there are primarily two approaches. simple, explicit methods, use a numerical scale of amino acid properties to represent primary sequence, and perform windowing and thresholding to locate long hydrophobic segments  <cit> . more advanced methods are implicit and treat the  <dig> amino acids as distinct entities, without explicit representation of their similarities, and statistically model their distribution in different topological locations of the tm proteins  <cit> . many of the advanced methods that use statistical modeling also expect that the membrane proteins conform to the commonly observed topology of cytoplasmic-tm-extracellular. however crystal structures of a number of channel proteins have been determined recently, that do not follow the general topology  <cit> . for example, the kcsa potassium channel has a pore forming helix that can be confused with a tm segment  <cit> . in aquaporin two short tm helices have flanking loops that exit onto the same side of the membrane  <cit> . owing to these deviations from the general architecture, accurate prediction of tm structure in these cases is difficult, and there is a need for prediction methods that do not restrict the "allowed" topologies of the membrane protein structure. in principle, explicit methods do not suffer from these limitations: without constraining the expected topology of the protein, they locate long hydrophobic segments and predict them to be tm helices  <cit> . however, these methods do not use additional information to overcome confusion between globular hydrophobic regions and tm segments, and suffer from low prediction accuracy  <cit> . one approach to reducing the errors is to use sequence profiles  <cit> . however, this results in a large number of parameters to be optimized, which is problematic given the overall little data available for training of these methods. furthermore, evolutionary information is restricted or not available for all membrane proteins. recently, a method was developed with a reduced number of parameters that uses evolutionary information only indirectly and incorporates structural parameters on amino acid burial derived from soluble proteins  <cit> .

here, we propose a different alternative approach that does not incorporate evolutionary information, only requires optimization of  <dig> free parameters, and is independent of topology. based on the recent quantitative demonstration that not only hydrophobicity but also other amino acid properties, in particular aromaticity and charge, carry topological information  <cit> , we developed a new method "tmpro" that derives features from several different amino acid properties to discriminate between tm and non-tm segments. tmpro uses a classification algorithm  to learn these features for tm prediction independent of the membrane topology. the framework for sequence representation, feature extraction and data processing for prediction used in tmpro is analogous to the framework developed previously for classification of secondary structure elements based on latent semantic analysis used for information retrieval and summarization in natural language processing . in this approach, the secondary structure or here tm segments are treated as equivalent to text-documents, and are represented as bag-of-words in terms of the underlying vocabulary. for tmpro, the vocabulary consists of {positive charge, negative charge, neutral charge, aromatic, aliphatic, ...}. segment/document similarity is computed based on the frequencies of occurrence of the "words" in the segment/document. the method is tested on established benchmark as well as more recent data sets, and is found to perform significantly better than other methods that also do not use evolutionary information in segment accuracies and similar to those that do use evolutionary information.

previous benchmark analysis on a dataset of proteins for which high-resolution crystallographic information was available at the time  <cit>  and other similar comparative evaluations  <cit>  have shown that tmhmm  <cit>  is one of the best methods for tm helix prediction from sequence alone. tmhmm is thus a widely accepted method to analyze large datasets and also to study specific proteins  <cit> . even though the benchmark server  <cit>  uses a somewhat outdated dataset for testing, it is an excellent resource to quantitatively compare tm helix prediction methods. using the benchmark server, tmpro achieves 30–50% reduction in segment error rate in comparison to the top-performing single sequence methods tmhmm, sosui  <cit> , das-tmfilter  <cit>  and ranks second best in segment accuracy, closely following phdpsihtm <dig>  a method that uses evolutionary information  <cit> . although accuracy, rather than error rate, is a more common measure of prediction performance it must be noted that the latter provides an absolute quantification of improvement. while the significance of a 5% increase in accuracy varies relative to the initial accuracy level, a 5% decrease in the error rate indicates the same amount of significance irrespective of the initial error rate – namely, a 50% error reduction resulting from accuracy increase from 80% to 90% is as significant as that resulting from only a 5% increase in accuracy from 90% to 95% which yields the same reduction in error rate of 50%. we also evaluated tmhmm on most recent available data sets, mptopo  <cit>  and pdbtm  <cit> .

RESULTS
amino acid properties other than hydrophobicity are also predictive of tm structure
to estimate the predictive capacity of different properties of amino acids, we used our protein sequence representations according to the groupings of amino acids by different properties described in methods, and applied the tmhmm architecture to these reduced representations. we used the publicly available model parameters of tmhmm  as-is  <cit> , and tested the prediction accuracy on the set of  <dig> high resolution proteins . first, we obtained the accuracies with the original representation of  <dig> amino acids as a control. next, the possible observations in each state are collapsed from  <dig> to  <dig> possibilities for polarity ,  <dig> for charge,  <dig> for aromaticity,  <dig> for size and  <dig> for electronic properties . to illustrate the procedure using polarity as an example, the probability mass of all polar amino acids is summed to yield the probability of observation of a polar residue in that state, as given in equation  <dig> 

 p=∑opo∈{a,d,e,f,g,i,l,m,p,v,w}p=∑opo∈{c,h,k,n,q,r,s,t,y} 

where, p refers to the probability of observing x while in state q; observation  <dig> refers nonpolar residue, and observation  <dig> refers to a polar residue. the primary sequence of the test set proteins is similarly mapped to a sequence of 0's and 1's depending on whether the residues are nonpolar or polar respectively. tm helices are then predicted for the mapped sequences with the tmhmm models modified by equation  <dig> 

the results are shown in table  <dig>  when the  <dig> possible amino acids are collapsed drastically to only the  <dig> possible property values, polar or nonpolar, the prediction accuracy of tm segments  is still at ~59%. in other words, the 2-valued polarity  of the residues contains ~64% of the information compared to that given by 20-amino acid representation. surprisingly, even more remarkable results were obtained with the other representations: the segment f-score of tm prediction with aromaticity property  and electronic property . table  <dig> shows that for both of these properties, the amount of predictive information contained by the collapsed representation of primary sequence is close to 92% of the information encoded in the full spectrum of the  <dig> amino acids. the residue accuracy q <dig> is in a similar range – the single property representations contain 80–94% of the information encoded by the full list of  <dig> amino acids.

the tmhmm architecture, with model parameters corresponding to version  <dig>  was used for tm helix prediction. note that all other comparisons used tmhmm  <dig> . the first row of results labeled amino acids corresponds to this "rewired" tmhmm. accuracies are computed locally, with metrics corresponding to those defined in  <cit> . f-score is the geometric mean of the segment recall  and segment precision . next row, marked 'polarity' corresponds to the tmhmm when the observation probabilities of  <dig> amino acids are grouped to form  <dig> observations, namely polar and nonpolar. columns  <dig> and  <dig> give what percentage contribution is made by polarity representation in comparison to that of  <dig> amino acid representation. for example, polarity representation achieves 59% f-score, which is 64% of the 92% segment f-score achieved by amino acid representation. results for aromaticity representation and electronic property representation are given similarly in the next two rows.

these results demonstrate that even with a rudimentary representation of the amino acid sequence as polar/nonpolar, aromatic/aliphatic/neutral, electron donor/acceptor/neutral, significant prediction accuracy can be achieved. this observation strongly validates the hypothesis that amino acid properties other than hydrophobicity/polarity alone have predictive capacity. this prompted us to test if we can exploit this fact to develop a new tm prediction algorithm that makes use of this additional information.

analogy to latent semantic analysis
a major challenge in tm helix prediction is the danger of overfitting because of the small amount of available training data, even if only few features are used in model development. text document classification suffers from the same difficulty, although in the human language technologies domain largely because of the hundreds of thousands of different words in the vocabulary. latent semantic analysis is a method successfully used for text document summarization to address this problem. in latent semantic analysis, similarities between documents or sentences are captured by studying the underlying word distributions – the order of appearance of the words is not preserved but the overall frequencies are accounted for  <cit> . singular value decomposition  and selection of the "top energy"  words is used to reduce the noise in the data. here, we propose to use latent semantic analysis in direct analogy to its application in language by capturing amino acid property distributions in tm segments analogous to word distributions in text documents. to this end, the windowed segments of protein sequences are represented as bag-of-words, where words here are the different amino acid properties – namely, polar, non-polar, charged positive, charged negative, and so on. although the number of words in the vocabulary of tm protein structure is very small , singular value decomposition and discarding of low energy dimensions is still necessary to overcome overfitting of the statistical models to the very small training data. discarding of highly specific feature dimensions ensures over fitting of statistical models does not happen. we verified the benefit of using latent semantic analysis as a feature reduction method by comparing classification using the full set of features and the latent semantic analysis derived ones .

separability of the feature vectors
first, we estimated the separability of the feature vectors derived from latent semantic reduction of amino acid property features. figure  <dig> shows a scattergram of the first two dimensions against each other of features derived with window size  <dig>  data corresponding to completely non-tm type are shown with a blue '+' marker and those corresponding to completely tm type are shown with a red 'o' marker. a linear classifier learnt using fischer's discriminant over these data points is also shown . it can be seen qualitatively that although there is a region of confusability, a large number of data of either class fall in the non-confused region. we can use the linear classifier to estimate the separability of the feature sets. of the feature vectors originating from completely-tm or completely non-tm windows of the training data, only 7% are misclassified. when all the feature vectors of the training set including those with mixed label are classified, only 15% of the features are misclassified, indicating that there is a good separability of the tm features from non-tm features. in tmpro, we used a neural network to learn the boundary between these feature vectors. when a smaller window size of only  <dig> residues is used, features corresponding to tm and non-tm are not separable with a boundary. we therefore used a hidden markov model that can capture gradual variation in the features along the sequence. the tmpro feature vectors combined with the linear classifier, the hmm and the nn classifier, will be referred to in the following as tmpro lc, tmpro hmm and tmpro nn, respectively.

benchmark analysis of transmembrane segment prediction in membrane proteins
in order to compare the performance of the three different implementations of tmpro to previous work we used the tmh benchmark web server for evaluations  <cit> . we trained our models with the same data set as had been used for training tmhmm, namely the set of  <dig> proteins. the data set used for evaluation is the set of  <dig> proteins  from the benchmark analysis paper  <cit> , referred to as dataset  <dig>  below.

we performed the evaluations by submitting the predictions on the benchmark evaluation server  <cit> . the predictions on alpha helical membrane proteins are evaluated by the following set of metrics  <cit> : qok is the percentage of proteins whose membrane segments are all predicted correctly. segment recall  is the percentage of experimentally determined  segments that are predicted correctly. segment precision  is the percentage of predicted segments that are correct. the residue accuracy q <dig> refers to the percentage of residues that are predicted correctly. we also computed the f-score, which is the geometric mean of segment level recall and precision . since recall and precision can each be increased arbitrarily at the expense of the other value, the two metrics when seen independently do not reflect the strength of the algorithm. hence, the geometric mean of the two,  is used as the metric.

the evaluation of tmpro , tmpro  and tmpro  by the benchmark server  is shown in table  <dig>  in comparison to that of tmhmm  <cit> . all three implementations of tmpro show improvements over tmhmm results. even the simple linear classifier yields a 4% increase in the f-score, with an "even increase" in both the segment recall and precision. the hmm model improves the qok compared to the linear classifier. while the f-score remains the same, there is an imbalance between recall and precision. although qok in both tmpro  and tmpro  is lower than in tmhmm, the segment level accuracies are improved in both these methods. tmpro  shows the highest improvement in qok. the results obtained with the nn method yield a qok of 83% . a high value of qok, which is the most stringent metric at the segment level, indicates that the tmpro nn achieves very good prediction of tm helices. this value of qok is higher than those achieved by any of the methods that have been evaluated by  <cit>  excepting hmmtop , and phdpsihtm <dig>  <cit>  . the segment f-score reaches 95% with an even balance between segment recall and precision. this segment accuracy represents a 50% reduction in error rate as compared to tmhmm, which is the best method not using evolutionary information evaluated in the benchmark analysis  <cit> . in other words, 10% of errors in the segments missed or over-predicted by tmhmm, half of those difficult segments are correctly predicted by tmpro. tmhmm misclassifies  <dig> proteins as soluble proteins, in contrast to tmpro which does not misclassify any. the results of all the methods evaluated in benchmark are shown in table  <dig> 

it can be seen that tmpro achieves high segment accuracy  even with a simple linear classifier. for a description of evaluation metrics see caption of table  <dig>  to demonstrate the requirement of singular value decomposition of features, the results obtained by directly using property count features without employing svd are shown in the last row. it may be seen that the results are slightly poor compared to standard tmpro.

performance of methods other than tmpro were originally reported in protein science  <cit>  and are reproduced here with permission from cold spring harbor laboratory press, copyright  <dig>  tmpro values in comparison to these published values are returned by the benchmark web server  <cit>  when tmpro predictions are uploaded. the columns from left to right show: method being evaluated; protein level accuracies: qok, which is the percentage of proteins in which all experimentally determined segments are predicted correctly, and no extra segments are predicted; that is, there is a one to one match between predicted and experimentally determined segments. false positives, which is the percentage of globular proteins that are misrecognized as membrane proteins. false negatives, which is the number of membrane proteins that are misclassified as soluble proteins because no tm segment is predicted in the protein. in segment level metrics are shown segment f-score which is the geometric mean of recall and precision, recall , precision . q <dig> is the residue level accuracy when all residues in a protein are considered together, and the q <dig> value for the entire set of proteins is the average of that of individual proteins. see  <cit>  for further details on these metrics.

performance on recent mptopo and pdbtm data sets
the benchmark analysis described in the previous section is useful in comparing the tmpro method with other well accepted methods, but the evaluation data set does not include recently determined membrane protein structures. we therefore computed the accuracies achieved by the tmpro on two recent data sets, mptopo and pdbtm. in order to allow for a fair comparison with tmhmm, the training set was kept the same as that used for tmhmm  <dig> , namely the set of  <dig> proteins.  <dig> out of  <dig> proteins of pdbtm and  <dig> out of  <dig> proteins of mptopo are contained in the training set. since tmpro  gave the best prediction results in the benchmark analysis, we only studied tmpro  further. in this and the subsequent sections, we henceforth refer to tmpro  as tmpro. in the evaluation of tmpro performance on more recent data, we also compared our predictions with two other algorithms that do not use evolutionary profile: sosui  <cit> and das-tmfilter  <cit> .

the results of the comparison between tmpro, tmhmm, sosui, das-tmfilter are shown in table  <dig>  as can be seen, tmpro achieves a 2–3% increase in segment f-score in comparison to tmhmm, 4–6% in comparison to sosui and 3–5% in comparison to das-tmfilter. thus, we conclude that amino acid properties used in conjunction with latent semantic analysis and neural network classifier are highly predictive of tm segments on the two recent data sets.

for description of columns, see caption of table  <dig>  qhtm,%obs and qhtm,%pred have been computed per-protein and averaged over all the proteins. last column shows the number of membrane proteins that have been mistaken as soluble proteins.

need for latent semantic analysis
we addressed the question whether or not the latent semantic analysis is really needed, because the tm structure vocabulary is much smaller than the word vocabulary in language. to this end, a different neural network was trained with  <dig> dimensional input vectors wherein the svd step was removed, and the 10-word input dimensions were connected directly to the neural network. segment accuracies were found to be about 2% lower for the f-score segment accuracy for the benchmark and pdbtm data sets . we conclude that although the tm structure input vocabulary is small, the svd step is useful for high accuracy tm segment prediction. we attribute this advantageous effect to the small available training data in this field.

confusion with globular proteins
the benchmark server provides a set of  <dig> globular proteins also for evaluation. although classification of proteins into globular and tm types is a problem fundamentally different from predicting the sequential positions of tm helices in tm proteins and the use of tm helix prediction methods to differentiating between tm and non-tm proteins is a misuse of these methods, it is still a useful exercise in estimating to what degree hydrophobic helices in soluble proteins are confused to be tm helices. we found that 14% of the globular proteins in the dataset provided on the benchmark server are confused to be that of membrane type by tmpro. however, it is to be noted that all the methods that have lower confusion with globular proteins also miss many membrane proteins and wrongly classify them to be of globular type . tmpro misclassifies only  <dig> of the mptopo proteins as soluble protein, whereas tmhmm and das-tmfilter misclassified  <dig> tm proteins and sosui misclassified  <dig> tm proteins as soluble proteins. in the pdbtm set, tmpro misclassifies only  <dig> proteins as soluble proteins as compared to  <dig> proteins by tmhmm and  <dig> proteins by sosui and  <dig> proteins by das-tmfilter that were misclassified .

application to specific proteins
in the above sections, we have demonstrated that without using evolutionary information, without restricting the membrane topology and with only using  <dig> free parameters, the tmpro approach results in very high accuracies in tm structure prediction of tm proteins with known topology. we believe that these features will make tmpro particularly useful in future predictions of tm helices in proteins from novel families and with novel topologies. although substantiating this claim quantitatively will require solving new membrane protein structures, we would like to present three specific examples to qualitatively illustrate the potential strengths and weaknesses of this method. figure  <dig> shows the predicted tm segments of the kcsa potassium channel , the aquaporins  and the human immunodeficiency virus  envelope glycoprotein gp <dig> . tmpro results are compared to those from tmhmm, das-tmfilter, sosui as representatives of single-sequence methods, and prodiv-tmhmm as a representative of a multiple-sequence alignment-based method.

 kcsa potassium channel: in contrast to the general topology of membrane proteins which have a membrane segment completely traversing from the cytoplasmic  to extracellular  side or vice versa, resulting in a ...cp-tm-ec-tm-cp... topology, the ksca potassium channel has a short 11-residue pore-forming helix  and an 8-residue pore-forming loop  that are surrounded by tm helices of a tetrameric arrangement of  <dig> chains. the loops on either side of this short helix exit onto the extracellular side of the membrane, giving the protein the topology of "cp-tm-ec-ph-pl-ec-tm-cp". the predictions of the tm segments in the kcsa potassium channel are shown in figure 2a. tmhmm incorrectly predicts part of the pore-forming helix and a part of the extracellular loop together as a tm segment while tmpro correctly predicts  <dig> tm segments, matching with the observed segments. sosui also correctly predicts only  <dig> tm segments while das-tmfilter predicts  <dig> segments. the evolutionary method prodiv-tmhmm predicts  <dig> segments incorrectly.

 aquaporins. aquaporins also deviate from the ...cp-tm-ec-tm-cp... topology in that they have two short tm helices  which are very distant in primary sequence but are close in the 3d structure to form what looks like a single tm helix in a back to back orientation of the two short helices. in this highly unusual topology, the two short helices are of the type cp-tm-cp and ec-tm-ec. the tm helix predictions are shown in figure 2b. none of the methods compared can correctly predict both short tm helices, including tmpro. of the observed eight tm helices, tmpro, tmhmm and das-tmfilter predict  <dig> while sosui predicts  <dig>  tmpro and das-tmfilter both predict an unusually long helix that connects tm segments  <dig> and  <dig>  although this prediction is wrong, both the methods provide some evidence for the separation of the two tm helices: das-tmfilter gives a text output that there is a possibility of two helices; in the analog output of tmpro nn there is a minimum at the position of the loop. in contrast, prodiv-tmhmm is not able to infer the two short helices. however, it does show a better alignment of the other predicted helices with the observed locations.

 hiv glycoprotein gp <dig>  the topology of gp <dig> is not known, and there is significant debate over the nature of the putative tm segments  <cit> . the tm helix predictions are shown in figure 2c. tmpro predicts two tm segments with high confidence; one of them is the known fusion peptide, which constitutes a tm helix during hiv fusion with the host cell. of the other methods compared , only das-tmfilter and sosui predict two tm segments – the other methods do not predict the tm helix at all and predict the fusion peptide as the only tm segment. such a prediction is incompatible with the experimental evidence that gp <dig> is a tm protein, while the fusion peptide is buried in a hydrophobic, but soluble non-tm core.

CONCLUSIONS
all tm helix prediction methods make use of the fact that the propensities of amino acids are characteristically different in tm helices as compared to soluble portions. the most successful methods incorporate very restrictive topologies into complex statistical models of amino acid propensities. these models use hundreds to thousands of free parameters but are trained with the limited data set available today. in this paper, we describe a method tmpro, which uses only  <dig> free parameters, does not use topology restrictions and does not require evolution information for success. the method is based on using novel amino acid property reduced vocabulary features beyond traditional use of hydrophobicity in conjunction with application of methods borrowed from text document classification. tmpro diplays high  segment accuracy consistently across benchmark and more recent tm protein datasets and is therefore well suited for segment level prediction. tmpro also shows promise in predicting tm segments in membrane proteins with unusual topology which are difficult to recover by other methods. the current qok values indicate that the method has still room for improvement, which could be obtained by reducing the false positive error rate, work that is currently underway.

further, the paper introduces a novel method of extracting features from protein sequence, namely that of latent semantic analysis model. most methods for transmembrane helix prediction capture amino acid propensities through single numbers  or probability distributions . here, we transform the training data into a new feature space, and learn a boundary that separates the transmembrane features from non-transmembrane features using a neural network model. the success of this approach suggests that it can find potential applications in other sequence-based analysis problems.
