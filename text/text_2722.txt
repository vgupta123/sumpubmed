BACKGROUND
epithelial tissues are composed of polarised cells connected by adherens junctions to form continuous sheets with apical and basal surfaces. how epithelial cells maintain their polarity, adhesion and shape remains poorly understood. polarity in epithelia is founded on the segregation of determinants into apical and baso-lateral membrane domains. adherens junctions are located at the interface of these domains and connect the actin cytoskeleton to neighbouring cells. actin filaments are visible around the entire plasma membrane, but a particularly prominent belt of actin filaments runs around the apical cortex, overlapping with the ring of adherens junctions. this apical contractile bundle of actin filaments is likely to be a critical element in organising the polarised form of epithelial cells . molecules regulating the spatial organisation of the actin cytoskeleton and generation of forces upon it are therefore of particular interest.

erzin-radaxin-moesin  proteins link actin filaments with the plasma membrane and are necessary to organise the cortical actin cytoskeleton . drosphila has a single erm family member, moesin, that is essential for maintenance of epithelial cell polarity and shape. cells lacking moesin are unable to maintain their polarised form, disassemble adherens junctions and leave the epithelium, ultimately undergoing apoptosis  <cit> .

myosin ii can slide two actin filaments against each other to create tension  and a single non-muscle myosin ii regulatory light chain  encoded by spagetti-squash . analysis of mutant alleles of these genes has revealed that non-muscle myosin ii is required for maintenance of epithelial cell shape, as well as other processes involving dynamic cell shape changes such as gastrulation movements and cytokinesis  <cit> .

both moesin and myosin ii are activated by phosphorylation and concentrated at the apical membranes of drosophila epithelial cells. several kinases that phosphorylate moesin  and sqh/mrlc . one of the four drosophila pp <dig> phosphatases, pp1β9c, has been shown to antagonise sqh/mrlc phosphorylation  <cit> . here, we identify sds <dig>  a pp <dig> phosphatase regulatory subunit, that binds to all four drosophila pp <dig> phosphatases and restricts the activity of both sqh/mrlc and moesin. we show that loss of sds <dig> has a similar but stronger phenotype than loss of pp1β9c, disrupting both epithelial cell shape and polarity.

RESULTS
sds <dig> is required for epithelial morphology in imaginal disc epithelia
in a piggybac transposon-mutagenesis screen in the drosophila eye imaginal disc, we recovered an insertion immediately upstream of the start codon of sds <dig>  which disrupts epithelial morphology, causing lethality . the lethality and mutant phenotypes of this allele were reverted when the piggybac transposon was excised. the piggybac transposon allows transcription  but is expected to prevent translation of the sds <dig> mrna. the sds22pb <dig> phenotype was also rescued by expression of a uas.sds22-gfp transgene . finally, expression of a uas.sds22-ir transgenic rnai line  produced phenotypes highly similar to that of sds22pb <dig> . although we have not specifically established that sds <dig> expression was reduced or absent in the insertion mutant, we presume that this is the case as the mutant is rescued by an sds <dig> transgene and phenocopied by sds22-rnai. together, these results show that the observed phenotypes are caused by disruption of the sds <dig> gene.

to examine the effect of this mutant more closely, we induced sds <dig> mutant clones in the developing wing imaginal disc, a commonly used model system for studying the growth and morphology of clones of cells. the wing disc is composed of a columnar epithelium, a pseudostratified monolayer, that is continuous with an overlying peripodial epithelium, a squamous monolayer . we induced gfp negative clones of wild-type  and sds <dig> mutant  cells and allowed the clones to grow for two  or three days . the sds <dig> mutant clones survived and grew similarly to wild-type clones for the first two days  but were eliminated by three days . this phenotype suggests that the sds <dig> mutant cells are sensitive to cell competition, a phenomenon whereby weaker cells are killed off by their more strongly growing neighbours .

we therefore gave sds <dig> mutant clones a growth advantage over their neighbours with the minute technique. this technique slows the growth of cells neighbouring the clone by making these cells heterozygous mutant for a minute gene, encoding a ribosomal subunit. with this method, wild-type clones grow to very large sizes  after  <dig> days. in contrast, sds <dig> mutant cells formed smaller clones over the same time period and exhibited defects in epithelial morphology . after  <dig> days, the sds <dig> mutant cells were still largely eliminated from the tissue, being extruded basally from the epithelium and undergoing apoptosis . extrusion of the sds <dig> mutant cells left behind dramatic folds in the epithelium , more easily appreciated when the filamentous actin cytoskeleton was visualised by staining with phalloidin .

to examine the cellular basis for these phenotypes, we examined confocal cross-sections of discs carrying sds <dig> mutant clones . by examining both smaller, younger clones  and larger, older clones  we observed a progressively stronger phenotype. in smaller clones, the mutant cells appear abnormally short in their apical-basal axis, adopting a more cuboidal morphology than their pseudostratified columnar neighbours . although the mutant cells in these small clones are abnormally short, they retained their polarised epithelial character, with normal localisation of the adherens junction component, armadillo . in larger clones, abnormally short mutant cells were also visible, but, more dramatically, infolding and extrusion of the mutant cells created islands of wild-type epithelium, surrounded by mutant cells . a large number of pyknotic nuclei, indicating apoptotic cells, were visible in the sds <dig> mutant clones , some of which appeared to have left the epithelium entirely . these results suggest that sds <dig> mutant cells first change shape, adopting a more cuboidal morphology, and later leave the epithelium and apoptose, leaving behind a deep infolding of the tissue.

we next tested whether extrusion of sds <dig> mutant cells from the epithelium was a cause or consequence of their apoptosis. we therefore prevented apoptosis of sds <dig> mutant cells by expression of the baculovirus caspase inhibitor, p <dig>  we found that mutant cells were still extruded from the epithelium, collecting as a ball of round cells on the basal side of the disc . these results show that sds <dig> is essential to maintain the epithelial integrity of wing imaginal disc cells and suggest that extrusion of mutant cells is the cause of apoptosis.

sds <dig> is required for epithelial morphology in ovarian follicle cells
to test whether the sds <dig> is specifically required in imaginal discs or more generally required in epithelia, we examined the follicular epithelium of drosophila egg chambers . as in the wing, sds <dig> mutant clones showed a spectrum of defects in epithelial morphology, depending on clone size. in smaller clones, cells appear abnormally contracted along their apical-basal axis . in many larger clones, cells rounded up and tended to form double layers . when markers of apical-basal polarity were analysed in sds <dig> mutant clones  or in clones expressing rnai against sds <dig> , abnormal spreading of baso-lateral markers  around the cell into apical regions was detected. in some clones, the apical marker apkc appeared relatively normal , while in others apkc staining appeared reduced and more diffuse . these results indicate that follicle cell epithelia deficient for sds <dig> show both cell shape and polarity defects.

sds <dig> mutant cells have a defective actin cytoskeleton
we next examined the actin cytoskeleton in sds <dig> mutant cells in egg chambers. staining with an antibody recognising both monomeric g-actin and filamentous f-actin, we found a striking punctate accumulation of actin in mutant cells in both the follicular epithelium and giant nurse cells . a similar accumulation of f-actin was not observed with phalloidin staining  indicating that g-actin is preferentially accumulating in sds <dig> mutant cells. notably, in the nurse cells, breakdown of the plasma membrane and underlying cortical actin cytoskeleton led to multinucleated nurse cells . strikingly, these sds <dig> mutant phenotypes, together with the apico-basal contraction phenotype described above, are similar to phenotypes reported for a mutant in the pp1β9c phosphatase  <cit> .

sds <dig> encodes a highly conserved pp <dig> phosphatase regulatory subunit
experiments in yeast and mammalian cells suggest that sds <dig> binds to and regulates pp <dig> phosphatases. we therefore tested whether this is also the case for drosophila sds <dig>  drosophila has four pp <dig> phosphatases, named after their isotype and cytological location: pp <dig> α96a, β87b, β13c and β9c. we expressed ha-tagged versions of each of these pp1s with gfp-tagged sds <dig> in drosophila cells and subjected cell lysates to immunoprecipitation with anti-ha antibodies . gfp-tagged sds <dig> was efficiently co-precipitated when any of the four ha-tagged pp1s was co-expressed. in the absence of ha-tagged pp1s, only a small background level of gfp-sds <dig> associated with ha-beads. the results indicate that sds <dig> binds to pp1s, confirming results in yeast and mammalian cells.

phosphorylation of two potential pp <dig> targets, sphaghetti squash and moesin, is increased in sds <dig> mutant cells
we next sought evidence that sds <dig> is required for pp <dig> phosphatase activity in drosophila. previous work suggested that sqh/mrlc is a target of pp <dig> β9c, because levels of phospho-sqh are elevated in pp <dig> β9c mutant cells  <cit> . in addition, evidence from mammalian cells suggested that the same phosphatase that targets myosin ii regulatory light chain may also target moesin , the sole drosophila erm protein  <cit> . we therefore examined levels of phospho-sqh and phospho-moe in sds <dig> mutant cells by immunostaining with phospho-specific antibodies. levels of both phospho-sqh  and phospho-moe  were elevated relative to total sqh  and moe  in sds <dig> mutant cells. note that the excess phospho-sqh and phospho-moe staining accumulates on both apical and baso-lateral membranes in mutant cells . thus, sds <dig> is required to restrict the phosphorylation of both moe and sqh/mrlc.

conserved function of sds <dig> in human cells
sds <dig> is widely conserved in the animal kingdom, including a mammalian homologue ppp1r <dig>  we therefore investigated if ppp1r <dig> performed similar functions in mammalian cells to sds <dig> in drosophila. a <dig> cells are keratinocytes that retain adherens junctions and grow in 'quasi-epithelial' clusters despite being transformed. first, we investigated the morphology of a <dig> cells lacking ppp1r <dig>  control a <dig> cells formed colonies with an average of  <dig> cells  whereas cells depleted for ppp1r <dig> formed smaller clusters usually consisting of 4– <dig> cells . thus, ppp1r <dig> helps to maintain the cohesion of groups of human cells of epithelial origin.

we next tested whether the ppp1r <dig> knockdown phenotype reflected a conserved function in regulating the phosphorylation status of ezrin, radixin and moesin  and myosin light chain . depletion of ppp1r <dig> with sirna oligos caused a dramatic increase in the phosphorylation of both erm proteins and mlc . this striking result indicates that the biochemical function of sds22/ppp1r <dig> is conserved between drosophila and mammals. to verify the rnai effect, we measured depletion of ppp1r <dig> mrna levels in a <dig> cells by quantitative rt-pcr . the mild variations observed between the extent of knockdown and phenotypic strength with different sirna oligos are likely to result from experimental differences between the staining and pcr.

discussion
our results show that sds <dig>  a protein previously identified as a pp <dig> phosphatase regulatory subunit in yeast, is essential for pp <dig> function in drosophila tissues. we have also shown that the phosphorylation state of both moesin and sqh/mrlc depends upon the sds22/pp <dig> phosphatase. our experiments do not prove that moesin and sqh/mrlc are direct substrates of sds22/pp <dig>  but this is a distinct possibility, as previous work has shown that sqh/mrlc can be found in a complex with pp <dig>  we have shown that this function of sds <dig> is conserved in mammalian cells, consistent with previous biochemical evidence that ppp1r <dig>  binds to pp <dig> proteins.

moesin and sqh/mrlc are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. our work favours a model in which restricted activation of moesin and sqh/mrlc maintains an apical contractile bundle of actin filaments that is essential for the shape and integrity of epithelial cells. both moesin and sqh/mrlc are activated by phosphorylation at the apical membranes of epithelia. in the case of moesin, this phosphorylation is essential for epithelial integrity and depends on the apically localised kinase slik  <cit> . in the case of sqh/mrlc, this phosphorylation is essential for cells to maintain their columnar shape and depends on rho kinase  <cit> . our work indicates that this restricted activation of these proteins at the apical membrane is complemented by dephosphorylation of moesin in other parts of the cell by ubiquitous pp <dig> phosphatases containing the regulatory subunit sds <dig>  in sds <dig> mutants, these actin regulators are activated along the entire cell membrane at high levels, leading to an abnormal contraction of the cells along their apical-basal axis. a similar, but milder, phenotype is visible in pp1β9c mutant clones  <cit>  and in clones overexpressing a phospho-mimetic form of sqh/mrlc  <cit> .

a second phenotype observed upon depletion of sds <dig> is a loss of apical-basal polarity, associated with cells rounding up and forming multi-layers. baso-lateral polarity markers appeared to be more strongly affected than apical markers in follicle cell epithelia. in imaginal discs, loss of polarity in sds <dig> mutant clones would explain the extrusion and apoptosis of these cells. importantly, both the loss of polarity in follicle cells and the extrusion of imaginal disc cells were most commonly visible in larger, older clones, indicating that this phenotype takes longer to manifest than the abnormal cell shape phenotype. this raises the possibility that sds <dig> may not be a direct regulator of cell polarity, but rather is required for polarity as a consequence of its regulation of sqh/mrlc and moesin. alternatively, there may be additional targets of sds <dig> that regulate the localisation of polarity markers.

evolution of sds <dig> and pp <dig> functions
sds <dig> was first identified in the single-celled yeast, schizosaccharomyces pombe where it encodes a nuclear protein that directly binds to and regulates a pp <dig> phosphatase  <cit> . in s. pombe, sds <dig> is essential for this phosphatase to control events during mitosis  <cit> . in metazoans, the pp <dig> family has expanded and sds <dig> has aquired additional functions in cell shape and polarity. accordingly, in both drosophila and mammals, sds <dig> is not exclusively localised to the nucleus and is instead found throughout the cell .

discrepancies between sds <dig> and pp <dig> mutant phenotypes in drosophila
drosophila have four pp <dig> phosphatases, named after their isotype and cytological location:pp1α13c,pp1α87c, pp1α96a and pp1β9c. the potential for redundancy among these four genes complicates genetic analysis. nevertheless, mutation of individual pp <dig> genes indicates that some may have unique functions. mutant alleles of pp1α87c, which contributes 80% of the total pp <dig> phosphatase activity  <cit> , show strong defects in mitosis  <cit> . of the other three drosophila pp1s, only one is essential, pp1β9c. interestingly, the morphological phenotype of pp1β9c-mutant cells resembles that of sds <dig> mutant cells in both follicle cells and nurse cells  <cit> . in pp1β9c mutant clones of the follicular epithelium, cells are shortened in their apical-basal axis and cytosolic levels of g-actin and phospho-sqh are increased  <cit> . however, pp1β9c mutant cells were not reported to show defects in cell polarity.

why do sds <dig> mutants not exhibit the mitotic defects found pp1α87c mutants? a likely explanation is that our sds <dig> mutant allele is not a null. in fact, depletion of sds <dig> by rnai in drosophila cells was recently reported to cause mitotic defects  <cit> ; . thus, our sds <dig> allele may be a hypomorph that reveals the function of sds <dig> in regulating cell shape and polarity.

why do pp1β9c mutants not exhibit the polarity defects found in sds <dig> mutants? a plausible explanation is that the presence of the three other pp1s masks this phenotype. pp1α87c mutants, which remove 80% of pp <dig> activity, might therefore be expected to show a polarity defect. however, the mitotic defects in these mutants prevent growth of clones, obscuring any potential polarity defect. thus, sds <dig> mutations are a convenient way of modulating pp <dig> activity that can reveal otherwise hidden phenotypes.

finally, other proteins have been identified which link pp <dig> phosphatases to target proteins in drosophila. these include mypt-75d, which appears to recruit sqh to pp <dig> and its loss has a weaker phenotype than loss of sds <dig>  <cit> . another mypt is mbs, whose loss of function phenotype even more strongly resembles that of sds <dig>  <cit> . while these two related mypts may be partially redundant with one another, it is unlikely that they are also redundant with sds <dig>  redundancy between sds <dig> and mypts would likely result in sds <dig> being non-essential. further experiments will be necessary to establish whether the sds22/pp <dig> complex and mypt/pp <dig> complexes act independently or together in cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we have confirmed work in other organisms by showing that sds <dig> acts as an essential subunit of pp <dig> phosphatases in both drosophila and mammals and controls cell shape and polarity in epithelial cells. there is an interesting parallel between the sds <dig> mutant phenotype in drosophila and the escape of metastasising tumour cells from epithelia to invade local tissues. interestingly, ppp1r <dig> has been reported to be significantly downregulated in human squamous cell carcinomas  and other cancers, such as melanoma and prostate cancer . thus, downregulation of sds22/ppp1r <dig> may contribute to tumour progression in humans.
