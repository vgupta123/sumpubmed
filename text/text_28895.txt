BACKGROUND
chronic periodontitis is initiated by a bacterial biofilm commonly called dental plaque, which initiates inflammation that affects the supporting structures of teeth, leading to bone and eventually tooth loss. the development of periodontitis is a multifactorial process involving interactions between the host and microorganisms that colonize the gingival sulcus. porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative anaerobe of dental plaque and it has been strongly implicated in the initiation and progression of periodontal disease and possesses a sophisticated array of virulence factors, including those that allow the bacterium to adhere to and invade host epithelial cells . p. gingivalis invasion is accomplished by manipulating host signal transduction and remodeling of the cytoskeletal architecture. however, the molecular mechanisms used by p. gingivalis to facilitate internalization are only partially understood.

intracellular bacterial pathogens have evolved highly specialized mechanisms to enter and survive intracellularly within their eukaryotic hosts. rabs play an essential role in both endocytic and exocytic traffic in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . rab <dig>  one of the most studied rab proteins in recent years, is involved in early steps of the endocytic process. rab <dig> regulates intracellular membrane trafficking of several pathogens, including salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium , mycobacterium spp  <cit> , and listeria monocytogenes  <cit> . rab <dig> may also mediate internalization of p. gingivalis in host cells; however, little is known about the role of rab <dig> in p. gingivalis invasion.

tnf-α is a potent pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine and is released by a variety of different cell types in response to various stimuli, including bacteria, parasites, viruses, cytokines and mitogens. tnf-α is involved in systemic and local inflammation due to stimulation of different signal transduction pathways, inducing the expression of a broad range of genes. tnf-α regulates a host response to infection; on the other hand, inappropriate expression of tnf-α has detrimental effects for the host. deregulation of tnf-α has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous complex diseases, including periodontitis , cardiovascular diseases  <cit> , diabetes mellitus  <cit> , autoimmune diseases  <cit> , and cancer  <cit> . clinical studies have shown an upregulation of tnf-α in periodontitis, e.g., in gingival crevicular fluid  <cit> , in gingival tissues  <cit> , and in plasma and serum  <cit> . tnf-α was shown to have an impact on different biological processes, including induction of inflammatory mediators, such as matrix metalloproteases , cytokines, chemokines and prostaglandins  <cit> , endothelial cell activation and endothelial-leukocyte interactions  <cit> , monocyte adhesion  <cit> , mediating bone remodeling  <cit> , and oxidative processes  <cit> . p. gingivalis induces highest levels of tnf-α expression, followed by il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> . however, we have no information on whether tnf-α affects invasion of p. gingivalis in periodontal tissues. in the present study, we examined the effect of tnf-α on invasion of p. gingivalis in gingival epithelial cells and clarified the molecular mechanism by which tnf-α augments invasion of p. gingivalis.

RESULTS
tnf-α augments invasion of p. gingivalis in gingival epithelial cells
we first examined the effect of tnf-α on invasion of p. gingivalis in ca9- <dig> cells. the cells were treated with 10 ng/ml of tnf-α for 3 h and were then incubated with p. gingivalis  for 1 h. invasion of the cells by p. gingivalis was determined by an invasion assay. invasion of ca9- <dig> cells by p. gingivalis was observed without tnf-α pretreatment. however, the invasion was significantly increased by stimulation with tnf-α . we also observed localization of intracellular p. gingivalis in the cells by using a confocal laser scanning microscope. z-stack image of the cells shows the intracellular localization of p. gingivalis. intracellular p. gingivalis was increased by stimulation with tnf-α, although a small amount of p. gingivalis was found without tnf-α pretreatment .figure  <dig>

tnf-α-augmented invasion of p. gingivalis is mediated by tnf receptor-i
the biological effects of tnf-α are transmitted via two distinct membrane receptors, tnfr-i and tnfr-ii  <cit> . to determine which type of tnfr mediates p. gingivalis invasion in ca9- <dig> cells, we examined the effects of neutralization of tnfrs on the tnf-α-augmented invasion of p. gingivalis. we first examined the expression of tnfr-i and tnfr-ii in ca9- <dig> cells by western blotting. the cells expressed tnfr-i but not tnfr-ii . we next examined the effects of a neutralizing anti-tnfr-i mab on the tnf-α-induced invasion of p. gingivalis in ca9- <dig> cells. the cells were preincubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody to tnfr-i for 1 h. then the cells were treated with tnf-α prior to addition of p. gingivalis. the anti-tnfr-i antibody exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on the invasion of p. gingivalis in ca9- <dig> cells . in contrast, a control mouse igg antibody did not prevent the augmentation of p. gingivalis invasion by tnf-α.figure  <dig>

tnf-α augments invasion of p. gingivalis through nf-κb and mapk pathways
to determine whether mrna synthesis and protein synthesis were required for p. gingivalis invasion, ca9- <dig> cells were preincubated with 1 μg/ml of the rna polymerase ii inhibitor actinomycin d or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for 1 h and were then incubated with tnf-α prior to addition of p. gingivalis. actinomycin d and cycloheximide exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the invasion of p.gingivalis into ca9- <dig> cells . the pi3k/akt signaling pathway is commonly initiated by transmembrane receptor signaling and controls cellular phagocytic responses through multiple downstream targets that regulate actin polymerization and cytoskeletal arrangements at the target site  <cit> . in addition, tnf-α activates the pi3k/akt signaling pathway  <cit> . therefore, we examined the relationship between pi3k activity and p. gingivalis invasion in ca9-22cells. ca9- <dig> cells were preincubated with wortmannin at 37°c for 3 h and were then incubated with tnf-α. treatment with wortmannin also exhibited significant inhibitory activity towards the invasion of p. gingivalis enhanced by tnf-α . several lines of evidence indicate that cellular effects of tnf-α were elicited through the activation of mapk and nf-κb pathways. to explore the contribution of mapk and nf-κb to tnf-α-augmented invasion of p. gingivalis, we examined whether p. gingivalis is able to invade ca9- <dig> cells in the presence or absence of mapk inhibitors and an nf-κb inhibitor. ca9- <dig> cells were preincubated with a p <dig> inhibitor , jnk inhibitor , erk inhibitor  or nf-κb inhibitor  for 1 h and were then incubated with tnf-α prior to addition of p. gingivalis. sb  <dig> and sp  <dig> exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the invasion of p. gingivalis into ca9- <dig> cells . in contrast, pd  <dig> did not prevent the invasion of p. gingivalis augmented by tnf-α. pdtc also exhibited significant inhibitory activity towards the invasion of p. gingivalis enhanced by tnf-α . these results suggest that tnf-α augmented invasion of p. gingivalis is mediated by p <dig> and jnk pathways and activation of nf-κb.figure  <dig>

icam- <dig> mediates invasion of p. gingivalis
expression of icam- <dig> is required for invasion of some bacteria in kb cells  <cit> . to determine whether icam- <dig> affects p. ginigvalis invasion into cells, we first examined co-localization of p. gingivalis with icam- <dig> in cells. ca9- <dig> cells were incubated with p. gingivalis, and localization of icam- <dig> and p. ginigvalis in the cells was observed by a confocal laser scanning microscope. icam- <dig> strongly expressed around the cell surface was partially co-localized with p. gingivalis in the cells . we also examined the expression of icam- <dig> in tnf-α-treated ca9- <dig> cells. ca9- <dig> cells were treated with or without tnf-α for 3 h. the cells were lysed and expression of icam- <dig> was analyzed by western blotting. icam- <dig> was expressed in ca9- <dig> cells without tnf-α stimulation . however, tnf-α increased the expression of icam- <dig> in the cells. we next examined whether icam- <dig> is associated with invasion of p. gingivalis into the cells. ca9- <dig> cells were treated with tnf-α for 3 h, incubated with an anti-icam- <dig> antibody or a control igg antibody for an additional 2 h, and then incubated with p. gingivalis. anti-icam- <dig> antibody suppressed invasion of p. gingivalis in the cells with or without tnf-α pretreatment . in contrast, p. gingivalis invasion was not prevented by control igg. these results suggest that icam- <dig> is partially associated with invasion of p. gingivalis into ca9- <dig> cells.figure  <dig>

rab <dig> mediates endocytosis of p. gingivalis
several studies have shown that rab <dig> regulates events in the fusion of bacteria-containing vacuoles and early endosomes . therefore, we investigated whether rab <dig> mediates p. gingivalis invasion into cells. we first examined the expression of rab <dig> in ca9- <dig> cells by western blotting. as shown in figure 6b, rab <dig> was expressed in ca9- <dig> cells. however, the level of expression was not affected by tnf-α. we next investigated the role of rab <dig> in p. gingivalis invasion using an sirna interference approach. invasion assays were carried out following transfection of rab5-specific sirna at a concentration of  <dig> pmol for 24 h. then expression of rab <dig> in the cells was examined by western blotting . the rab <dig> sirna-transfected ca9- <dig> cells were incubated with p. gingivalis for 1 h. internalization of p. gingivalis into the cells was reduced by silencing the rab <dig> gene . to determine whether the rab <dig> affects p. ginigvalis invasion into cells, ca9- <dig> cells expressing gfp-rab <dig> were treated with p. gingivalis, and localization of rab <dig> and p. ginigvalis in the cells was observed by a confocal laser scanning microscope. transfected gfp-rab <dig> was partially co-localized with p. gingivalis in the cells . these results suggest that rab <dig> is partially associated with invasion of p. gingivalis into ca9- <dig> cells.figure  <dig>

 ca9- <dig> cells were transfected with  <dig> pmol sirna specific for rab <dig> or control sirna using lipofectamine  <dig> reagent, as described by the manufacturer. then expression of rab <dig> in the cells was examined by western blotting.  rab <dig> sirna-transfected ca9- <dig> cells were incubated with p. gingivalis for  <dig> h. viable p. gingivalis in the cells was determined as described in methods.  ca9- <dig> cells were transfected with expression vectors with inserted genes of gfp alone and gfp-rab <dig>  the cells were incubated with p. gingivalis for  <dig> h. the cells were then stained using anti-p. gingivalis antiserum. each molecule was visualized as follows: gfp and gfp-rab <dig>  and p. gingivalis . bars in each panel are  <dig> μm.  active form of rab <dig> colocalizes with p. gingivalis in ca9- <dig> cells. ca9- <dig> cells were transfected with vectors with inserted genes of gfp alone , gfp-rab <dig>  , and gfp-rab <dig>  . the cells were incubated with p. gingivalis for  <dig> h. then localization of p. gingivalis and rab <dig> in the cells was observed by a confocal laser scanning microscope. each molecule was visualized as follows: gfp and gfp-rab <dig>  and p. gingivalis . bars in each panel are  <dig> μm.  overexpression of the active form of rab <dig> increased invasion of p. gingivalis in ca9- <dig> cells. ca9- <dig> cells were transfected with expression vectors with inserted genes of gfp alone , gfp-rab <dig>  and gfp-rab <dig> . viable p. gingivalis in the cells was determined as described in methods. . *, p <  <dig>  versus control; **, p <  <dig>  versus gfp alone.



overexpression of the active form of rab <dig> increased invasion of p. gingivalis
rab <dig> proteins switch between two distinct conformations, an active state characterized by binding to gtp and an inactive state bound to gdp. to test whether the activity of rab <dig> affects p. ginigvalis invasion into cells, ca9- <dig> cells expressing fluorescent-labeled gfp alone , gfp-rab <dig>  , and gfp-rab <dig>   were treated with p. gingivalis, and localization of rab <dig> and p. ginigvalis in the cells was observed by a confocal laser scanning microscope. transfected gfp-rab <dig>  was co-localize with p. gingivalis in the cells . in contrast, gfp-rab <dig>  did not co-localize with p. gingivalis in the cells. we next transfected vectors expressing gfp alone, gfp-rab <dig>  and gfp-rab <dig>  into ca9- <dig> cells. the transfected cells were then treated with p. ginigvalis and the levels of invasion were compared among those cells. internalization of p. gingivalis into cells was increased in ca9- <dig> cells expressing gfp-rab <dig>  compared to that in ca9- <dig> cells expressing gfp alone . on the other hand, overexpression of gfp-rab <dig>  suppressed invasion of p. gingivalis into the cells. these results suggest that the activity of rab <dig> influences p. gingivalis invasion.

tnf-α was associated with activity of rab <dig> through the jnk pathway
several cytokines can control the activity of rab <dig> to regulate the rate of endocytosis through activating the downstream signaling pathway. therefore, we examined whether activation of rab <dig> was affected by map kinases activated with tnf-α signals using a pull-down approach with a fusion protein that selectively binds gtp-loaded rab <dig> . the system selectively bound gtp-bound rab <dig> . ca9- <dig> cells were transfected with an expression vector with inserted gfp-rab <dig> gene. the transfected cells were preincubated with map kinase inhibitors, including a p <dig> inhibitor , jnk inhibitor  and erk inhibitor , and were then incubated with tnf-α. the active form of rab <dig> in the cell lysates was subjected by a gst-r5bd pull-down assay and was analyzed by western blotting. level of the active form of rab <dig> induced by tnf-α was not affected by treatments with sb <dig> and pd <dig>  however, treatment with sp <dig> decreased the level of the active form of rab <dig> induced by tnf- . these results suggest that jnk kinase mediates activation of rab <dig> by stimulation with tnf-α. furthermore, we invastigated whether nf-kb inhibition affects the activation of rab <dig>  ca9- <dig> cells were transfected with an expression vector with an inserted gfp-rab <dig> gene. the transfected cells were preincubated with an nf-κb inhibitor  at 37°c for 1 h and were then incubated with tnf-α for 3 h. the active form of rab <dig> in the cell lysates was subjected to a gst-r5bd pull-down assay and was analyzed by western blotting with anti-gfp antibodies. treatment with pdtc also did not affect the level of the active form of rab <dig> induced by tnf- . these results suggest that nf-κb does not mediate activation of rab <dig> by stimulation with tnf-α.figure  <dig>

tnf-α increased colocalization of p. gingivalis with icam- <dig> and rab5
finally, we examined the relationships among p. gingivalis, icam- <dig> and rab <dig> in ca9- <dig> cells. ca9- <dig> cells were transfected with expression vectors with inserted genes of gfp-rab <dig> and were then treated with tnf-α and further incubated with p. gingivalis. the cells were then stained using an anti-icam- <dig> antibody and antiserum to p. gingivalis whole cells. a small amount of p. gingivalis that co-localized with icam- <dig> and gfp-rab <dig> was observed in ca9- <dig> cells without tnf-α stimulation. however, tnf-α stimulation increased co-localization of p. gingivalis, icam- <dig> and gfp-rab <dig> in ca9- <dig> cells . these findings suggest that tnf-α affects the localization of rab <dig> and icam- <dig> in cells and may enhance internalization of p. gigivalis in the cells.figure  <dig>

discussion
tnf-α is a potent pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontitis . tnf-α was also shown to activate oral epithelial cells. however, it was not known whether tnf-α affects p. gingivalis invasion in epithelial cells. in the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that tnf-α augmented p. gingivalis invasion in oral epithelial cells.

in this study, we showed that tnf-α activated rab <dig> through jnk but not through p <dig> and erk, although tnf-α activates all of them. activation of jnk is associated with the invasive process of p. gingivalis  <cit> . therefore, jnk activated by tnf-α may mediate activation of rab <dig> and may enhance internalization of p. gingivalis in cells. rab <dig> is an important regulator of early endosome fusion. therefore, tnf-α may induce formation of early phagosomes by activating rab <dig>  on the other hand, bhattacharya et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that cytokines regulate bacterial phagocytosis through induction of rab gtpases. they showed that il- <dig> specifically induces the expression of rab <dig> and activates salmonella trafficking in cells through erk activation. on the other hand, il- <dig> induced rab <dig> expression through p <dig>  another study showed that activation of p <dig> mapk regulates endocytosis by regulating the activity of rab <dig> accessory proteins such as rab5-gdi, eea <dig>  and rabenosyn- <dig>  which are known to regulate membrane transport during endocytosis. several independent studies have also shown that activation of erk regulates endocytic traffic of multiple receptor systems, for example, 5-ht1a receptor, m <dig> muscarinic receptor, and opioid receptors . these findings suggest that activation of different kinases regulates intracellular trafficking and also indicate that the mechanism by which mapks regulate endocytosis may differ depending on the stimulants and cells.

as shown in figure 5b, the p <dig> inhibitor sb <dig> blocked tnf-α-augmented p. gingivalis invasion in ca9- <dig> cells. however, sb <dig> did not inhibit the activation of rab <dig> despite the fact that internalization of p. gingivalis into the cells was partially blocked by knock-down of rab5a. tnf-α induced icam- <dig> expression through activating erk/p <dig> mapk  <cit> . therefore, p <dig> inhibition suppressed icam- <dig> expression followed by decrease in p. gingivalis invasion. on the other hand, rab <dig> has three isoforms  and the isoforms are able to compensate for each other. as we interfered with the expression of rab5a but not that of rab5b and 5c, rab5b and rab5c, which were not blocked, may compensate the function of rab5a for bacterial internalization.

p. gingivalis can enter ca9- <dig> cells without tnf-α stimulation . blockade of the tnf receptor and inhibition of p <dig> and jnk did not completely inhibit p. gingivalis invasion. these results suggest that p. gingivalis is also internalized in a tnf-α-independent manner. p. gingivalis invades gingival epithelial cells without any stimulation to the host cells. p. gingivalis fimbriae interact with cell surface molecules such as integrins and the interactions trigger colonization and internalization of the bacteria in various cells  <cit> . furthermore, the trypsin-like cysteine protease gingipain produced by p. gingivalis also plays an important role during p. gingivalis entry into cells  <cit> . p. gingivalis can enter host cells by using these molecules without tnf-α stimulation. however, tnf-α is increased in inflamed periodontal tissues and gingival crevicular fluids. in those tissues, p. gingivalis invasion is increased, and it promotes persistent infection and avoids immune surveillance. the cellular tropism of p. gingivalis depends in part upon the fimbriase of the bacteria and the receptors of the host cell. we used ca9- <dig> cells as a model for gingival cell infection. these cells were originally derived from human gingival carcinoma and phenotypically resemble gingival epithelial cells. however, ca9- <dig> cells may also express some cell surface receptors that are different from endogenous gingival cells. thus our experimental system is representative of bacteria-host interactions in vivo, but not a perfect model we have little evidence about that in vivo and further study is needed to make a final conclusion concerning the physiological relevance of the phenomena.

ca9- <dig> cells expressed tnfr-i but not tnfr-ii . we also ascertained the expression of tnfr-ii after treatment with tnf-α in ca9- <dig> cells. however, tnf-α did not induce tnfr-ii expression in ca9- <dig> cells. therefore, we concluded that the effects of tnf-α are mediated through tnfr-i. tnf-α activates caspases and induces apoptosis in cells. however, c9- <dig> cells were alive during the experimental periods even after stimulation with tnf-α . therefore, we think that the apoptotic activity of tnf-α towards host cells does not affect p. gingivalis invasion.

icam- <dig> as well as rab <dig> was associated with tnf-α-augmented p. gingivalis invasion . adhesion of p. gingivalis to host cells is multimodal and involves the interaction of bacterial cell surface adhesins with receptors expressed on the surfaces of epithelial cells. adhesion of p. gingivalis to host cells is mediated by many extracellular components, including fimbriae, proteases, hemagglutinins, and lipopolysaccharides . among the large array of virulence factors produced by p. gingivalis, the major fimbriae , as well as cysteine proteinases , contribute to the attachment to and invasion of oral epithelial cells  <cit> . on the other hand, integrins can act as receptors for the integrin-binding proteins of several bacterial species . p. gingivalis also associates with β <dig> and α5β <dig> integrin heterodimers via fima. αvβ <dig> integrin also mediates fimbriae adhesion to epithelial cells  <cit> . in addition, carbohydrate chains on epithelial cell membrane glycolipids have been reported to act as receptors for p. gingivalis  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that icam- <dig> is required for the invasion of p. gingivalis into human oral epithelial cells  <cit> . various cytokines including tnf-α induce expression of icam- <dig>  <cit> . therefore, icam- <dig> expresion and p. gingivalis invasion in periodontal sites may be associated with the primary stages of the development and progression of chronic periodontitis.

it has been demonstrated that a large number of intracellular bacteria are present in il-6-treated cells that have an increasing amount of rab <dig>  <cit> . these results indicate that overexpression of rab <dig> by cytokines may promote the fusion of bacteria containing phagosomes with early endosomes and thereby inhibit their transport to lysosomes and may help in prolongation of bacterial survival in host cells and thus establish a chronic infection that could exacerbate the immune response. at periodontal sites, such phenomena could occur. periodontopathic bacteria induce various cytokines including tnf-α. it has been shown that of tnf-α is upregulated in periodontitis, e.g., in gingival crevicular fluid  <cit>  and in gingival tissues  <cit> . therefore, periodontopathic bacteria including p. gingivalis induce the production of cytokines including tnf-α in periodontal tissues. excess tnf-α in periodontal tissues activates gingival epithelial cells and increases the possibility of p. gingivalis invasion in the cells, resulting in persistence of p. ginigvalis infection and prolongation of immune responses in periodontal tissues.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that p. ginigvalis invasion into human gingival epithelial cells was enhanced by stimulation with tnf-α. tnf-α in periodontal tissues, the production of which is induced by plaque bacteria including p. gingivlis and is increased by diabetes, may lead to persistent infection of p. ginigvalis and prolongation of immune responses in periodontal tissues.
