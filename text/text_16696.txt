BACKGROUND
sinorhizobium  meliloti belongs to the rhizobiales order of the alpha-proteobacteria class, together with important human pathogens such as bartonella and brucella, and with several plant-associated bacteria of relevant agricultural importance, such as agrobacterium, ochrobactrum, bradyrhizobium, mesorhizobium and rhizobium  <cit> . s. meliloti is distributed world-wide in many soil types where it can be found in free living form or as a symbiont of leguminous  plants, on which it induces the formation of nodules, specialized organs where bacteria fix nitrogen within the plant cytoplasm  <cit> . medicago sativa l.  and the diploid relative m. truncatula gaertn.  are among the most studied host species for the s. meliloti symbiosis  <cit> . although several essential features of the symbiotic association between alfalfa  and s. meliloti have been elucidated and, nowadays, scientists are able to explain most of the major steps of nodule formation, many aspects are still not fully understood  <cit> . in fact, although the main steps and genes related to symbiosis have been identified by mutants produced in laboratory , one of the less considered aspects of the rhizobium-legume symbiosis concerns the effects of genetic variation of natural strains on plant growth due to differences in symbiotic efficiency. in this perspective, two of the most investigated strains of s. meliloti are bl225c and ak <dig>  <cit> . these strains were isolated while investigating the genetic variability of s. meliloti populations  and revealed different symbiotic phenotypes  <cit> . strain bl225c was found to be more effective in increasing plant growth of m. truncatula and alfalfa plants than strain ak83; indeed plants inoculated with ak <dig> grow similar to un-inoculated control plants even though they produce a larger number of immature nodules. comparative genomic hybridization  studies showed that ak <dig> and bl225c strains have from  <dig> % to  <dig> % of cds divergent  with respect to the reference sequenced strain rm <dig>  <cit> , most of the genomic polymorphism being located on the symbiotic megaplasmid psyma. however, a cgh array can only reveal when genes present in the microarray, represented by the reference genome, are lost or duplicated in the other strains, but it is unable to identify the genetic repertoire exclusively possessed by a novel strain. to date, the only genome sequence available for s. meliloti belonged to strain rm <dig>  <cit>  and only recently also to strain sm <dig>  <cit> . however it is known that most of the genomic analyses in bacteria revealed large differences in genes content even between closely related strains  justifying the introduction of the pangenome concept  <cit>  where the pangenome is intended as the sum of "core"  and "accessory"  genes. it has also been proposed that non-essential genes are responsible for driving the evolutionary diversification between bacterial strains  <cit> , even if their adaptive value is often uncertain  <cit> . despite the large interest and the number of studies performed on s. meliloti biology and genetics, the size and the functionalities of the s. meliloti pangenome remain to be extensively elucidated, especially at the level of the symbiotic diversity.

moreover, besides the gene content present in the accessory genome, also regulatory networks have been shown to be plastic enough to accommodate and explain phenotypic variability at different evolutionary scales  <cit> . in bacteria, regulon polymorphism, that is the existence of a core and an accessory regulon, has been previously studied in different contexts and taxonomic scopes, such as pathogenesis regulation in clostridium perfringens strains  <cit>  and cell cycle control in the alpha-proteobacteria class  <cit> , both at the intra-specific and inter-specific levels, respectively. in particular, it was shown that in some alpha-proteobacteria the cell-cycle regulatory circuits undergo rearrangements which seem to maintain the logic of the regulation.

in this work, we present the genome sequences of s. meliloti strains ak <dig> and bl225c, aiming to provide a depiction of the s. meliloti pangenome, which may be associated with symbiotic interaction and then could be at the basis of differences in the symbiotic efficiency of natural strains. to address this aim, after full genome sequencing and annotation, we developed a pipeline of automatic search which integrates available general purpose genomic databases  with rhizobial specific resources  to identify all genes that could be possibly related to symbiosis. then we investigated the possible genetic determinants of phenotypic differences between these strains using computational methods and integrating classical genomics analysis, such as the identification of shared and specific genes with the prediction of regulons for selected transcription factors that are known to play a role during symbiosis. together, these approaches allowed us to find a genomic interpretation to the phenotypic differences and to define a set of accessory genetic factors related to the symbiotic process.

RESULTS
general features of ak <dig> and bl225c genomes
the genome sequences of strains ak <dig> and bl225c, were obtained as described in materials and methods; both genomes resulted to be larger than that of strain rm <dig> by additional  <dig> kbp  and  <dig> kbp  . this larger dna content is paralleled by an increase in the number of cdss .

strain ak <dig> has the highest percentage of orfans  , defined as those genes with no detectable similarity with other genes in any other organism  <cit> , and the lowest number of orfs coding for proteins with homology to cogs, interpro, go and rhizobase entries, while strain rm <dig> shows the highest number of transposases and insertion sequences  compared to ak <dig> and bl225c . other relevant features of general importance are those related to the environmental sensing and transport: we noticed that bl225c and ak <dig> strains have more type iv secretion systems-related proteins than the reference strain rm <dig>  however, a similar number of abc transporters-related proteins and of type iii secretion systems-related proteins were found across the three genomes, tough no fully functional type iii secretion systems were detected, as previously noticed for rm <dig> strain  <cit> . finally, two-component signal transduction systems related proteins are slightly higher in rm <dig> and bl225c strains than in ak <dig> .

defining core and accessory s. meliloti genome
by comparing the  <dig> cdss, found in the three genomes, a set of  <dig> orthologous groups was identified; a subset of  <dig> was conserved across all the three genomes and accordingly defined as the core genome of s. meliloti species. the remaining  <dig> orthologous groups were defined as members of the accessory genome for these three genomes. the strain with more unique genes is ak <dig>  with  <dig> exclusive groups, while bl225c and rm <dig> have  <dig> and  <dig> exclusive groups, respectively . in additional file  <dig> the full list of core and accessory proteins is reported.

when the very recently published sm <dig> genome  <cit>  was added to our proteome set of the three strains , the core genome contained  <dig> orthologous groups, with the loss of  <dig> groups, suggesting a certain stability of the core genome size in this species, while the accessory genome comprised  <dig> orthologous groups.

in order to define possible differences in functions encoded by the core and/or the accessory genomes and by the different strains, each protein was assigned to a cog category  and the abundance of each cog category was plotted . statistically significant differences between core and accessory genome were found only for cog category l  and for proteins with no assigned cog : in these two categories, the accessory genome is enriched, especially in the category x. similar enrichment in cdss with no assigned function has been previously reported in the accessory genome of other organisms  <cit>  as well as in the s. meliloti plasmid psmesm11a  <cit> . for other cog categories, no statistically significant difference was found, though a higher representation of all assigned functions was found in the core. finally no significant difference of cog categories between the three strains was found .

structural genomics
while bl225c contains three replicons as rm <dig>  ak <dig> is composed by five circular replicons, corresponding to the chromosome, psyma and psymb, which are also present in the genome of rm <dig> and bl225c and two new small replicons  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <dig>  mbp and  <dig>  mbp in size as schematized in figure  <dig>  the genomic structures of the fully assembled complete genomes were compared with a full-scale genomic alignment . the chromosome and the psymb chromid are characterized by a high resistance to genome rearrangements, with an almost perfect shared synteny, with only few insertions in the chromosome of strain ak <dig> and few rearranged regions of the chromid psymb. the other replicons showed indeed lower degrees of synteny: in particular plasmid <dig> of strain ak <dig> had no region of similarity with the other replicons of strain rm <dig> and bl225c . concerning the symbiosis-required megaplasmid psyma, a very low degree of synteny was observed indicating an increased rate of rearrangements for psyma, and indeed evidences for rearrangements were noticed, since at least three fragments of plasmid <dig> showed an high degree of similarity with the rm <dig> psyma , while just one fragment was found to be highly similar to the psyma of bl225c . these data suggest that ak <dig> plasmid <dig> may be derived from or represent an evolutionary step toward the megaplasmid psyma. interestingly, a fragment  <dig> kbp long of plasmid <dig> showed similarity with another symbiotic-related plasmid . on the other hand, megaplasmid psyma of strain bl225c compared to rm <dig> showed a higher number of syntenic regions and a lower number of inversions than ak <dig> . the genomic structure of the newly sequenced s. meliloti strain sm <dig> was also analyzed ; as expected sm <dig> psmesm11c  is the most diverse replicon in comparison with replicons of strains ak <dig> and bl225c. no significant homologies were found between the small plasmids of strain ak <dig>  and strain sm <dig> genome, as well as no significant hits between strain sm <dig> small plasmids  and ak <dig> and bl225c genomes. however, the presence on strain sm <dig> psmesm11a plasmid of two regions of  <dig> and  <dig> kbp syntenic to megaplsmid psyma of strain rm <dig> was confirmed  <cit> .

the location of transposases and insertion sequences was analyzed. indeed in most of the cases, transposase encoding genes were enriched in regions carrying the traces of genomic rearrangements , than in highly syntenic regions where the corresponding frequencies are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  is/ <dig> kb in the three genomes. as reported in figure  <dig>   <dig> transposases were found in a  <dig> kbp insertion of the chromosome of strain rm <dig> , as well as in the biggest five non-syntenic regions of the ak <dig> chromosome. in the psyma megaplasmids,  <dig> transposases were found in the non-syntenic region of strain rm <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> transposases were found in strain ak <dig> in two non-syntenyc regions  and in strain bl225c  <dig> and  <dig> transposases were found in two non-syntenyc regions . finally,  <dig> transposases were found flanking the two regions of strain ak <dig> plasmid <dig> that are also present on megaplasmid psyma in strain rm <dig> 

accessory genome and symbiosis-related functions
looking at the genetic content of the symbiotic megaplasmid psyma of rm <dig> in comparison with ak <dig> and bl225c, previous findings using cgh were confirmed  <cit> : in fact, many genes harbored by rm <dig> psyma were found missing in the genomes of the two other strains . moreover, two regions of rm <dig> psyma , predicted to be a large part of the so-called microaerophilic gene set  <cit> , were not present in strain ak <dig> and to a lesser extent also in strain bl225c.

we then focused on genes involved in some aspects of the symbiotic process, that we identified using a data mining strategy combining different sources of information, using the following approach: for each orthologous group having a predicted link to a nodmutdb and/or rhizobase member  the related literature was retrieved and analyzed to speculate its actual role in symbiosis. this approach was combined with other annotation sources  in a dedicated data mining procedure ; together with this approach, also those proteins with names containing symbiosis-related terms  were retrieved. in particular we were interested in genes that are differentially present in the three strains and that could be related to the different symbiotic phenotypes of these strains.

by using the strategy described above, we identified, among the accessory genes, those that have been implicated in the symbiotic process in rhizobia through experimental work. within a total number of  <dig> orthologous groups retrieved,  <dig> of them were found to belong to the accessory genome  .

these  <dig> accessory genes were divided in  <dig> entries :  <dig> of which were present in bl225c,  <dig> in rm <dig> and  <dig> in ak <dig> genomes . three main classes were identified, one comprising genes involved in microaerophilic growth during bacteroid development and putatively under the control of the transcriptional regulator fixk  <cit> , the second comprising other genes either directly or indirectly related to symbiosis  and the latter comprising those proteins with limited information about their function, although probably involved in the symbiotic process. as mentioned before, genes belonging to the first class , were absent in the accessory genome of strain ak <dig> and present in both rm <dig> and bl225c strains . these genes are mainly clustered in three parts of the psyma replicon of rm <dig>  two of which known to be induced in microaerophilic conditions  <cit>  . they include: a fixk-like gene encoding for a transcriptional regulator, the third copy of the operon fixnoqp encoding for an electron transport chain with high affinity to oxygen and a series of operons related to nitrogen metabolism: nor , nir , nos , nnr , nrt , plus two genes also related to the microaerophilic environment, cycb <dig> and hemn. interestingly, we also identified different copy numbers of fixk genes in the three genomes: the actual regulator  was present in the core genome, fixk <dig>  was present only in rm <dig>  and a fixk-like copy  was found in rm <dig> and bl225c genomes, as a part of the microaerophilic gene set; finally a fixk-like weak homolog was found in strains ak <dig> and bl225c . other genes, present only in the accessory genome of rm <dig> and bl225c genomes, include a gene for a short chain dehydrogenase  whose mutation leads to the formation of white and elongated nodules  <cit>  and the gene cluster for rhizobactin biosynthesis which, though not directly affecting nitrogen fixation  <cit> , may have long-term effect on plant growth  <cit> . all together these two groups of accessory genes absent in ak <dig> genome may help explain for the reduced efficiency of plant growth promotion by this strain. interestingly, only one symbiotic gene is absent just in strain bl225c; the first copy of the nodq gene, the mutation of which leads to a slightly delayed nodulation  <cit> ; since strain bl225c does not exhibit such a phenotype, it can be argued that probably this strain can overcome this gene loss, although the mechanism is still unclear. among the remaining genes,  <dig> are exclusively present in strain ak <dig> including a nickel permease/hydrogenase hupe putatively involved in recycling the hydrogen developed during nitrogen fixation  <cit> , a cadherin-like gene which may have auxiliary roles via type i secretion system in cellular aggregation or attachment to roots  <cit> , a ctp:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, involved in the phosphatididylcholine metabolism whose presence in the bacterial membrane is also important for the adhesion to eukaryotic cells  <cit>  and the nodm gene, whose sequence is homologous but not orthologous to the same gene in the other two strains; since this gene plays a crucial role in the early steps of the rhizobial invasion of the host plant, this difference could have an impact on the symbiotic process. two symbiotic genes are present in bl225c only, namely a phosphatidylcholine synthase distant homolog and the putative two-component response regulator gene nwsb, which is related to strain competition for nodulation in b. japonicum  <cit> . six genes are present in rm <dig> only: cgmb, the second and the third copies of fixt, the second copy of nodp, the second copy of fixk and the expr fragment; this means that expr is disrupted in rm <dig> and therefore it doesn't give any functional products. the remaining genes include a homolog of the 5-aminolevulinate synthase  involved in the biosynthesis of porphyrins and putatively involved in the release of the rhizobial cells from the infection threads   <cit> , one gene encoding a cytochrome p <dig> oxidase , known to be expressed in bacteroids in other rhizobial species  <cit> , the acds gene encoding acc deaminase , which play a role in competition for nodulation  <cit> , and a putative fucose isomerase , which may add modifications to the nod factor of strain rm <dig> and bl225c, thus potentially altering the communication with the host plant  <cit> .

in conclusion, it can be noted that  <dig> orthologous groups are missing in the symbiosis defective ak <dig>  which is, in fact, a large proportion of the accessory genes related to symbiosis .

the symbiosis-related panregulon
to further investigate the genomic differences that may be related to the variable symbiotic phenotypes of ak <dig>  bl225c and rm <dig> strains, the predicted regulons of a series of symbiotic transcription factors were analyzed. a set of eight transcriptional regulators related to symbiotic interaction was chosen, based on the knowledge of their dna binding sites  and on regulon information on closely related rhizobial species that may share the same binding site with s. meliloti. the set included transcriptional regulators involved in root exudates perception and early nodulation steps , microaerophilic adaptation , nitrogenase synthesis , iron uptake , eps biosynthesis  and plant invasion competition  . it should be noticed that the fixk regulated genes only partially overlap with those found to be expressed under microaerophilic conditions  <cit> , which may be under control of other regulators. for each transcriptional regulator, genes putatively regulated and present in the genomes of strains rm <dig>  ak <dig> and bl225c were sorted out by hmm scanning and the core  and the accessory  putative regulons were defined . we defined the panregulon as the totality of gene families controlled by a specified transcription factor in a certain number of genomes, in analogy to the term pangenome  <cit> , and which is formed by the core and the accessory regulons. the putative panregulon varies in sizes from  <dig>  to  <dig>  orthologous groups ; since some of the regulated targets could be part of an operon or be additional regulators, the actual size of the predicted panregulon is definitely under-estimated. nolr and nesr show a very little panregulon ; the accessory regulons of the other transcriptional regulators are very large and variable, accounting for 31-79%  of all panregulons. the occurrence of wide accessory regulons could be due to the absence in one or two strains of the target genes or to the absence of the regulatory upstream sequences when the genes are present. the absence of target genes is the most frequent case ranging from 50%  to 100%  of the targeted genes, with an average value of 69% . on the contrary the variability of dna binding sites upstream cdss  is less frequent with an average value of 31%. the list of all genes sorted out as putatively regulated by the selected transcriptional regulators is reported in additional file  <dig>  the composition of the accessory regulons in terms of un-annotated targets was calculated counting the number of cds with no cog classification  resulting in an average percentage of 49%, while for the core regulons the percentages of un-annotated targets is lower .

the genes of the predicted regulons were then divided into  <dig> functional groups: electron transport, symbiosis, nitrogen metabolism, others or un-annotated. in figure 6a the eight regulons are showed; in many cases putatively regulated genes could be matched with experimental data: for nodd <dig> the experimental regulation of nodl, nodf, noda, nodm and syrm  <cit>  was confirmed by the analysis; for fixk the regulation of fixnoqp <dig>  fixnoqp <dig>  fixgis, arcabc, napefdabc, norbce, cycb <dig> and degp <dig> was confirmed  <cit> ; for nifa the regulation of nifhdkex, fixabcx operons and the nifb genes  <cit>  were also confirmed. experimental confirmation of regulatory predictions by nolr was also found for noda, nodd <dig>  nodd <dig> and nodm  <cit> , by fur for sita  <cit> , by nesr for the methk operon and the ahcy gene  <cit>  and by chvi for ropb  <cit> . interestingly, even if the nolr gene is disrupted by a single base insertion in strain rm <dig>  <cit> , the nolr binding sites in front of nodd <dig>  nodd <dig> and noda are maintained, suggesting that the inactivation may be relatively recent. co-regulation by different factors was observed on several genes; in particular  <dig> genes were putatively regulated by more than one regulator  and a co-regulation by  <dig> out of the  <dig> selected regulators was also found , indicating that some of the symbiotic regulators are linked together in a network that ensures the coordination of the expression of the genes required during infection and nitrogen fixation. the fixk regulator is predicted to control the highest number of genes involved in the symbiotic process, as well as those involved in nitrogen metabolism and electron transport needed in the microaerophilic environment of the bacteroid  <cit> .

concerning the variability in the predicted regulons , it is evident that ak <dig>  shows some differences in the regulatory networks: in ak <dig> purb is apparently not controlled by nifa; nodm is regulated by nolr only in strain ak83; in ak <dig> fixk controls nape and napf. it should be noted that these differences were not observable from patterns of gene presence/absence, illustrating the added value of regulon prediction in comparative genomics.

CONCLUSIONS
the symbiosis between the nitrogen-fixing bacterium s. meliloti and the leguminous host plant medicago is a case of a complex multigenic phenotype and one of the most deeply studied model systems  <cit> . in order to elucidate the genomic bases of the significant variability exhibited by environmental strains of the symbiotic phenotype, we sequenced the genomes of two strains of s. meliloti, ak <dig> and bl225c. these strains have different effects on plant growth, also in comparison with the reference strain rm <dig>  <cit> .

we defined the core and the accessory genome of these three genomes as an approximation of the species pangenome, identifying a large set of genes, about 35% of the total number of genes annotated, belonging only to one or two of the strains analyzed; this proportion is similar to the pangenomic content of escherichia coli, with ca. 42% of the genes belonging to the accessory genome, while in other species, such as bacillus anthracis and streptococcus pneumoniae, the size of the accessory genome is larger, 60% and 77% respectively. the s. meliloti pangenome elucidated in this work using three strains can be considered a good approximation of the species symbiotic pangenome, considering that the core genome size wasn't strongly affected by the addition of strain sm <dig> 

the considerable number of accessory genes supports the vast phenotypic diversity of these strains and of the species  <cit> .

therefore we focused on genes, present in accessory genome, which were linked with the symbiotic process, using all literature and database data available. the approach, developed to aim at that purpose as depicted in additional file  <dig>  applied to the repertoire of symbiotic genes, had the advantage to speed up the data mining step, since any source of information was in the same database, allowing us to combine the results of various analyses. it should be emphasized that the procedure can be extended to any interesting phenotype for which genomic molecular information  are available.

symbiosis related genes have previously been shown to be highly variable among rhizobial species  <cit>  to address the presence of an intra-specific variability in s. meliloti, a list of variable genes linked to symbiosis was compiled and analyzed trying to highlight the putative connection with the symbiotic phenotype of the three strains . surprisingly, the symbiotic accessory genome was found to be highly variable, including about 21% of all the symbiotic orthologs considered. we can then expect that different symbiotic phenotypes shown by s. meliloti strains may be indeed due to such high variability in the symbiotic accessory genome.

the most notable feature found was a large variability in the so-called "microaerophilic" gene set  <cit> , which includes the transcriptional regulator annotated as fixk-like, a third copy of electron transport chain  and several genes related to nitrogen metabolism . these results confirm previous data obtained by cgh  <cit>  and by phenotypic microarray on different metabolic activity of these strains in different nitrogen sources  <cit> . these findings, together with the lack of a symbiosis-related short chain dehydrogenase and the entire rhizobactin operon, may contribute to link the reduced plant height phenotype with the genomic structure of strain ak <dig>  the inefficiency of symbiotic phenotype of strain ak <dig> was also confirmed by the observation of a relatively large number of immature nodules produced by ak <dig> on m. truncatula  <cit>  and alfalfa . consequently, the content of the accessory genome in the different strains can explain the differences in the symbiotic phenotype.

even if the extent of the accessory genome by itself could account for the phenotypic differences between ak <dig> and bl225c/rm <dig>  a comparable variability at regulatory level was also found. a set of regulons, defined by previous experimental work and known to be involved in the symbiotic process , was investigated searching for the core regulon  and accessory regulon . again, a surprisingly large accessory regulon was found for most of the selected transcriptional regulators, either because of the absence of the target gene or because of the absence of the predicted regulator binding site. this result suggests that, other than gene content variation, regulons polymorphism could be a key determinant in the variability of symbiotic performances among strains.

the inclusion of regulatory networks in comparative genomic studies could represent a powerful extension of the analysis that can uncover the evolutionary events otherwise undetectable by gene presence comparison. the assumption behind this approach is that genetic modifications can occur in the structural gene and in the cis regulatory sequences leading to the same effect of the inactivation of the gene function. in the case of the symbiotic regulons of s. meliloti, we found that about 31% of the putatively missing connections between regulator and regulated genes are due the loss of dna binding sites, the relative genes being still present in the genome. it can be conjectured that the presence of genes, which have lost  the binding sites, may reflect a relatively recent evolutionary divergence, such as is expected among strains of the same species and confirmed in the case of nolr, whose inactivation in the laboratory strain rm <dig> probably happened recently, since even its dna-binding sites are conserved.

in conclusion, we reported here a genomic analysis of the symbiotic variability at the intra-specific level in the non pathogenic α-proteobacterium s. meliloti. the analysis revealed an accessory genome fraction and regulatory variability large enough to shed light on the symbiotic differences of the strains. moreover, several variable genes related to symbiotic diversity were clearly identified and their occurrence and putative regulation in the core and accessory genome was investigated. finally, the approach used here on symbiotic genes could possibly be applied to other diverse phenotypes. the methods and the database set-up in the present work can constitute a powerful framework for the addition of other sequenced strains enabling the refinement of the pangenome and panregulon shape, and predicting new candidate genes responsible for symbiotic variability.
