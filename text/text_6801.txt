BACKGROUND
cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are photosynthetic prokaryotes. they played a key role in the evolution of life on earth, converting the early reducing atmosphere into an oxidizing one as they performed oxygenic photosynthesis  <cit> . cyanobacteria are thought to be progenitors of chloroplasts via endosymbiosis  <cit> . approximately, 20â€“30% of earth's photosynthetic activity is due to cyanobacteria. the proteomic composition and dynamics of plasma membranes of cyanobacteria have been extensively characterized  <cit> . however, the influence of the structure and composition of cyanobacterial membranes on cellular uptake remains largely unknown. delivery of exogenous dna into cyanobacteria was first reported in  <dig>  <cit> , although the internalization mechanisms are still unknown  <cit> . since cyanobacteria play key roles in supporting life on earth and have potential in biofuel production and other industrial applications  <cit> , understanding how they interact with the environment by processes such as internalization of exogenous materials, is becoming increasingly important.

the plasma membrane provides a barrier that hinders the cellular entry of macromolecules, including dnas, rnas, and proteins. in  <dig>  two groups simultaneously identified a protein called transactivator of transcription  from the human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  that possesses the ability to traverse cellular membranes  <cit> . the penetrating functional domain of the tat protein is comprised of  <dig> amino acids   <cit> . subsequently, many peptide analogues of the basic amino acid-rich domain of the tat protein were synthesized and evaluated for membrane transduction potential  <cit> . these positively charged, amphipathic peptides were termed cell-penetrating peptides  or protein transduction domains   <cit> .

among synthetic peptides, the cellular uptake of polyarginine was found to be much more efficient than that of polylysine, polyhistidine, or polyornithine  <cit> . we found that a nona-arginine  cpp peptide can enter cells by itself or in conjunction with an associated cargo  <cit> . cargoes that r <dig> can carry include proteins, dnas, rnas, and inorganic nanoparticles . r <dig> can form complexes with cargoes in covalent, noncovalent, or mixed covalent and noncovalent manners  <cit> . cpps can deliver cargoes up to  <dig> nm in diameter  <cit> , and r <dig> can internalize into cells of various species, including mammalian cells/tissues, plant cells, bacteria, protozoa, and arthropod cells  <cit> .

despite many studies using various biological and biophysical techniques, our understanding of the mechanism of cpp entry remains incomplete and somewhat controversial. studies have indicated that cpps enter cells by energy-independent and energy-dependent pathways  <cit> . the concentration of cpps appears to influence the mechanism of cellular uptake  <cit> . our previous studies indicated that macropinocytosis is the major route for the entry of r <dig> carrying protein or dna cargoes associated in a noncovalent fashion  <cit> . however, we found that cpp/qd complexes enter cells by multiple pathways  <cit> . multiple pathways of cellular uptake were also demonstrated with cpp-fusion protein/cargo complexes associated in a mixed covalent and noncovalent manner  <cit> . in contrast, our study of the r <dig> modified with polyhistidine  indicated direct membrane translocation  <cit> .

the cellular entry mechanisms of cpps in cyanobacteria have not been studied. in the present study, we determined cpp-mediated transduction efficiency and internalization mechanisms in cyanobacteria using a combination of biological and biophysical methods.

RESULTS
autofluorescence
to detect autofluorescence in cyanobacteria, either live or methanol-killed cells were observed using a fluorescent microscope. both  <dig> and  <dig> strains of cyanobacteria emitted red fluorescence under blue or green light stimulation  when alive; dead cells did not display any fluorescence . this phenomenon was confirmed using a confocal microscope; dead cyanobacteria treated with either methanol or killed by autoclaving emitted no red fluorescence . thus, red autofluorescence from cyanobacteria provided a unique character.

mechanistic studies of protein transduction
to demonstrate protein transduction in cyanobacteria, both  <dig> and  <dig> strains were treated with either green fluorescent protein  alone or r9/gfp noncovalently complexed at a molecular ratio of 3: <dig>  after  <dig> min, the medium was removed, and cells were washed and observed using a confocal microscope. surprisingly, green fluorescence was detected in both control and experimental groups in both strains . red autofluorescence indicated that the cells in both groups are alive . to test whether gfp alone enters cyanobacteria by classical endocytosis, physical and pharmacological inhibitors, including low temperature, valinomycin, nigericin, n-ethylmaleimide , and sodium azide, were used. endocytic efficiencies of gfp were significantly reduced in the  <dig> strain treated with  <dig> and  <dig> mm of nem, while  <dig> mm of nem suppressed gfp uptake in the  <dig> strain . all of these inhibitors reduced the entry of gfp, indicating that endocytosis is the route for spontaneous gfp internalization . insofar as nem was the most effective inhibitor of classical endocytosis in both stains , it was used in subsequent experiments.

to block classical energy-dependent endocytosis in cyanobacteria, nem was added to cells for  <dig> min followed by addition of either gfp alone or r9/gfp complexes. we found that both strains treated with gfp emitted red fluorescence but not green fluorescence . in contrast, both green and red fluorescence were detected in the cells treated with r9/gfp complexes . relative fluorescent intensities were analyzed and compared with control cells in the absence of nem and r <dig>  nem treatment decreased green fluorescence in cells exposed to gfp alone , but did not affect the level of green fluorescence in cells treated with r9/gfp mixtures . these results suggest that gfp cannot cross nem-treated cell membranes without the assistance of r <dig>  thus, we hypothesize that there is an alternative route of protein transduction in cyanobacteria in addition to classical endocytosis.

to identify the alternative route for cellular entry of r9/gfp complexes in cyanobacteria, we used macropinocytic inhibitors 5--amiloride , wortmannin, and cytochalasin d  in cells pretreated with nem to block clathrin- and caveolin-dependent endocytosis. the cells were treated with either r9/gfp as a control or r9/gfp plus macropinocytic inhibitors. significant reductions in the intensity of cellular green fluorescence were observed in treatments with cytd and wortmannin in the  <dig> strain of cells, and with all of the macropinocytic inhibitors in the  <dig> strain of cells . wortmannin was the most effective inhibitor in the  <dig> strain, while eipa was the most effective inhibitor in the  <dig> strain . these results indicate that protein transduction of r <dig> in cyanobacteria involves lipid raft-dependent macropinocytosis.

cytotoxicity
to investigate whether treatments with r <dig> and gfp are toxic and cause membrane leakage, cytotoxicity was evaluated using cells treated with bg- <dig> medium and 100% methanol as negative and positive controls, respectively. in the presence of nem, cells were incubated with r9/gfp complexes mixed with cytd, eipa, or wortmannin as experimental groups, respectively. the 1-- <dig> -diphenylformazan  assay was applied. there is a significant correlation  between cell number and activity of mtt reduction . further, 100% methanol, 100% dimethyl sulfoxide , and autoclave treatments were effective in causing cell death . we chose 100% methanol treatment as a positive control for cytotoxicity analysis. the  <dig> strain treated with r9/gfp complexes mixed with cytd, eipa, or wortmannin in the presence of nem was analyzed by the mtt assay. no cytotoxicity was detected in experimental groups, but significant reduction in cell viability was observed in the positive control . to further confirm the effect of endocytic modulators on cell viability, the membrane leakage assay was conducted. no membrane damage was detected in the negative control and experimental groups . these data indicate that r9/gfp and endocytic modulators were nontoxic to cyanobacteria.

discussion
in this study, we demonstrate that both  <dig> and  <dig> strains of cyanobacteria use classical endocytosis for protein ingestion. macropinocytosis is used by r9-mediated delivery system as an alternative route of cellular entry when classical endocytosis is blocked . our finding of macropinocytosis-mediated entry of a cpp is consistent with studies of protein and dna delivery in other eukaryotic cells  <cit> .

we also demonstrate that cyanobacteria possess red autofluorescence. identification and quantification of cyanobacteria in environmental samples or cultures can be time-consuming  and sometimes costly. schulze et al. recently presented a new and fast viability assay for the model organism  <dig> strain of cyanobacteria  <cit> . this method used red autofluorescence of  <dig> strain of cyanobacteria to differentiate viable cells from nonviable cells without tedious preparation  <cit> . a combination of this new assay with absorption spectra or chlorophyll concentration measurements was further proposed for more accurate quantification of the vitality of cyanobacteria  <cit> .

most previous reports have focused on photosynthesis as the major route by which cyanobacteria obtain nutrition, while only a handful of studies have evaluated endocytosis as a means of nutrition ingestion  <cit> . the first indication of macropinocytosis in cyanobacteria came from our initial screening of cpp-mediated noncovalent protein transduction among some representative organisms  <cit> . we found that the mechanism of protein transduction in cyanobacteria may involve both classical endocytosis and macropinocytosis  <cit> . while cyanobacteria contain cell walls and peptidoglycan layers  <cit> , these structures did not hinder the penetration of cpps in cyanobacteria , gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria and plants  <cit> . our study is the first report that cyanobacteria use both endocytosis and macropinocytosis to internalize exogenous macromolecules . the sensitivity of cyanobacteria to macropinocytic inhibitors is strain-specific: the  <dig> strain is more sensitive to wortmannin, while eipa is more highly effcetive at reducing protein transduction in the  <dig> strain . there was no enough evidence yet to explain why nem-treated cyanobacteria decreased green fluorescence in cells exposed to gfp alone. we hypothesize that the spontaneous internalization of gfp in cyanobacteria may be mediated heavily by energy-dependent endocytosis, which can be blocked by the atp depletion reagent nem . however, nem could not completely inhibit cpp-mediated macropinocytosis, which is lipid raft-dependent  <cit>  and may be slightly energy-dependent  <cit> .

biofuels have emerged as one of promising sources for alternative energy. initial biofuel development was based on the synthesis of ethanol using fermentative organisms and polysaccharides  <cit> . the limited availability of polysaccharides led to extensive research on the direct use of sunlight, the ultimate energy source on this planet. photosynthetic microorganisms can accomplish this by fixing carbon dioxide and converting sunlight energy into chemical energy as fuel. this raises the possibility of using engineered cyanobacteria in two ways to improve phtotosynthetic biofuel production. cyanobacteria could be either gene-engineered using recombinant dna technology  <cit>  or protein-engineered using cpp-mediated protein delivery method. cyanobacteria have an advantage compared to eukaryotic algae in that the genetic manipulation of cyanobacteria is more straightforward and well-developed  <cit> . however, the protein engineering of cyanobacteria mediated by cpps is just at its infancy.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have demonstrated that both synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> and synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig> strains of cyanobacteria possess red autofluorescence. cyanobacteria use classical endocytosis and macropinocytosis to internalize exogenous gfp and cpp/gfp proteins, respectively. moreover, the cpp-mediated delivery system is not toxic to cyanobacteria, and can be used to investigate biological processes at the cellular level in this species.
