BACKGROUND
heat illness, a continuum of disorders caused by hyperthermia, includes heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat injury, and heat stroke . hyperthermia occurs when the body’s core temperature exceeds its hypothalamic set point as a result of overwhelming external or internal sources of heat or the effects of drugs or disease which impair heat dissipation . without adequate fluid replacement, dehydration and loss of blood volume lead to circulatory collapse, severe hyperthermia, and eventually heat stroke, defined as neurological dysfunction associated with a body temperature higher than 40°c  in humans .

sudden death related to heat stroke occurs primarily in individuals with pre-existing cardiac abnormalities, organ failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, or acute onset of organ failure  <cit> . systemic inflammatory response syndrome  is considered to be the primary cause of organ dysfunction related to heat stroke  <cit> , resulting in severe encephalopathy, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial injury, hepatocellular injury, intestinal ischemia, pancreatic injury, and hemorrhagic complications  <cit> . sirs may also be complicated by endotoxemia and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation through leakage of the gut epithelium  <cit>  and/or damage to the vascular endothelium  <cit> , respectively . thus, multiorgan dysfunction syndrome is the primary reason for heat-related morbidity and mortality.

at the cellular and molecular levels, severe hyperthermia causes acidosis, hypoxia, and cellular fatigue. thermal stress leads to an increased expression of heat shock proteins  associated with thermotolerance . the cellular response extends beyond hsps to include networks of gene changes in organs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells after whole-body hyperthermia  <cit>  or heat stroke  <cit> . moran and colleagues  <cit>  describe at least three components of a time-dependent cascade of events related to the heat-stress response: 1) the involvement of hsps, 2) a response that involves interferon-inducible genes , and 3) a small, nonspecific stress response shared by other cell lines and stressors  <cit> . heat stress–induced molecular perturbations are also a likely contributing factor  to altered heat intolerance  <cit> .

recently, we described an anatomically accurate, three-dimensional rat model of thermoregulation during heat stress  <cit> , in which rats were placed at 37°c until their core temperature reached  <dig> °c ; they were then allowed to recover. here, we perform a global characterization of the heat-stress–induced gene response in liver, lung, kidney, and heart tissues at tc,max, and during recovery at  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours. previous studies examined transcriptional alterations related to heat stress in various mammalian models and tissues . in this study, we use a whole transcript, gene array approach, which avoids issues related to 3’ bias, genes which lack poly-a tails, and confounders related to isoform variation  <cit> . we present a pathway analysis to establish the regulatory framework of heat stress in our conscious rat model. within this framework, we examine the consensus heat-stress response  found in all four organs, and discuss genes not previously linked to in vivo heat stress. finally, we identify changes in gene and protein expression in the heart which are anchored to histological evidence of organ injury, and we propose that mitochondrial dysfunction and injury pathways are involved in the observed cardiomyopathy.

RESULTS
to induce the pathophysiological effects of heat stress, we placed conscious rats in an incubator at 37°c and monitored their core temperatures using remote telemetry implants . animals were euthanized when their core temperature reached  <dig> °c , or they were returned to their normal housing environment and allowed to recover for up to  <dig> hours prior to sacrifice. we characterized the response of the animals to heat stress using a standard panel of hematological and clinical chemistry assays, as well as a histopathological evaluation of the liver, heart, kidney, and lung. in the context of these well-established assays, we also analyzed global changes in gene expression in the four tissues using microarrays and performed a “shotgun” proteomic analysis of cardiac tissue using mass spectrometry. this approach allowed us to link changes in gene and protein expression to tissue injury, the animals’ physiological state, and their overall health .figure  <dig> 
heat stress experimental design.  core temperature  was monitored by telemetry probe in real time in heated rats  or time-matched controls , and animals were sacrificed at tc,max ,  <dig> hours, or  <dig> hours. tissues were preserved for histopathology, transcriptomics, and proteomics.  blood chemistries and histopathology were evaluated. differential gene expression, gene set analysis, and kegg enrichment were examined in all organs at tc,max to characterize the consensus gene response to heat stress. self-organizing maps were constructed to identify genes that clustered in individual responders. we evaluated proteomic changes in the heart at tc,max,  <dig> hours, and  <dig> hours. animals in the 48-hour cohort were subdivided by histopathology . venn diagrams indicate the numbers of genes  and proteins  identified in each respective analysis. red text denotes statistically significant changes in the same genes and proteins.



physiological profiles
complete blood count and concomitant decrease in body weight were significantly different between heat-stressed animals and time-matched control animals only at tc,max . further, blood urea nitrogen , a measure of kidney function, was significantly higher in heat-stressed animals, consistent with dehydration and/or kidney function impairment . as expected, no animals demonstrated significant heat-related histopathological changes at tc,max . the incidence and severity of lesions, such as cardiomyopathy and chronic progressive nephropathy, were generally minimal and consistent with the normal background lesions found in rats at 2– <dig> months of age .

animals sacrificed at  <dig> hours demonstrated background lesions which were minimal in severity and not considered related to heat exposure . in one animal, we found diffuse, acute tubular necrosis in the kidney  and acute necrosis in the liver, mostly affecting hepatocytes in the periportal regions . similar lesions did not occur in any other animal at any other sacrifice time point.

although we found essentially no evidence of physiological or histopathological changes related to heat stress at  <dig> hours, we observed substantial cardiac injury in three out of the six animals sacrificed at  <dig> hours . all treated animals  had degeneration of cardiomyocytes with subacute inflammation consisting of mostly macrophages. this type of lesion is common in fisher  <dig> rats , but the pattern of injury and severity of the degeneration and inflammation observed at the 48-hour time point suggested treatment-related tissue injury rather than an incidental, strain-related cardiomyopathy . extensive tissue damage often leads to kidney proteinosis similar to that observed in the animals most severely affected by cardiac inflammation . thus, while the physiological parameters at tc,max suggest that the animals had undergone heat-related dehydration, the development of tissue injury appeared to be a delayed process. no injury was evident at  <dig> hours, but there was clear, persistent, heat-induced cardiac damage in some animals at  <dig> hours.figure  <dig>

the consensus heat-stress response: pathway analysis of the transcriptome at tc,max
in order to elucidate the biological events related to heat stress at the molecular level, after heat exposure we identified genes which were differentially expressed in the heart, lung, liver, and kidney using partek® genomics suite software  , and we performed a functional enrichment analysis of the genes using the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery   <cit> . gene set analyses were conducted in partek to determine the top enriched gene ontology  terms for each condition . at tc,max,  <dig> unique biological processes , cellular components , and molecular functions  were enriched across all organs, of which only  <dig> were common to all four organs, and  <dig> were common at least to two organs. using david, we also determined enriched kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways . the differentially expressed genes  from all four organs were enriched for functional terms related to protein folding and/or response to unfolded protein, regulation of apoptotic process, and the response to lipopolysaccharide /cytokine in the gene set enrichment analysis. there was also a set of stress and transcriptional responses associated with the mitogen-associated protein kinase  kegg pathway .table  <dig>

the unfolded protein response is activated in response to the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum . once activated, global protein translation is halted and chaperones  are produced to manage protein folding. if the unfolded protein response fails, a cellular alarm response occurs, leading to autophagy and recovery  or apoptosis  <cit>  and/or cytolysis  <cit> . at the molecular level, imbalance of the proteostasis network results in a cascade of responses to cellular stressors, involving molecular chaperones, clearance mechanisms, detoxifying enzymes, and an accumulation of misfolded aggregation-prone and proteotoxic species, which can lead to cell-specific dysfunction  <cit> . the heat shock factor  <dig>  cycle can be initiated by proteotoxic stress, ultimately leading to the expression of heat shock proteins  <cit> , however, less is known about how heat stress, proteostasis networks, apoptosis, and autophagy contribute to organ-specific injury. in the heart, aberrant folding and unfolded protein response signaling lead to a number of pathologies, including myocardial ischemia, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure  <cit> . thus, the enriched pathways in protein folding and unfolded protein response at tc,max may point toward a global imbalance of the proteostasis network  <cit> .

the consensus heat stress response: differential gene expression in protein folding and regulation of apoptosis pathways at tc,max
the environmentally induced heat shock transcripts and heat-stress–related transcripts enriched in pf and ra displayed the largest fold changes in heat-stressed animals relative to controls at tc,max . interestingly, our three-dimensional thermoregulatory model for the rat predicted that the liver temperature in heat-stressed animals exceeds that of other organs  <cit> . this prediction is consistent with our findings that the largest changes in temperature-dependent hsps occurred in the liver.

a wide variety of physiological and environmental stimuli can induce expression of hsps, including physical, chemical, and biological insults   <cit> . genes encoding hsps are divided into five superfamilies based on molecular weight: the small hsps  <cit> , the hsp <dig>  family, the hsp <dig>  family, and the hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig>  families  <cit> . as molecular chaperones, hsps play central roles in 1) protein folding, aggregation, transport, and/or stabilization; 2) cytoprotection, by preventing post-mitochondrial apoptosis in caspase-dependent pathways  and/or caspase-independent pathways   <cit> ; and 3) cytoprotection, by preventing apoptosis at the premitochondrial level through inhibition of stress-activated kinases  in an adenosine-triphosphate -independent manner   <cit> . although a recent report demonstrates a heat-stress–induced increase in rat liver expression of the inducible hsp <dig> protein  but not the constitutive forms   <cit> , our study demonstrates large increases in the products of both constitutive and inducible hsp genes at tc,max , including hspb <dig>  hspa1b, hspe <dig>  serpinh <dig>  hspd <dig>  hsp90aa <dig>  hsph <dig>  and several members of the dnaj  chaperone family, transcripts homologous to genes coding for hsps , and heat-stress–related genes . snord <dig> encodes a small nucleolar rna which is transcribed from intronic regions of the hsp <dig> gene in mice  <cit> . heat-stress–induced expression of snord <dig> may facilitate the repair process involving ribosomal rna after heat injury  <cit> . the environmentally inducible hsp gene, hspa1b, was expressed at very high levels in all tissues , although one copy of the gene did not functionally cluster with the pf response in david . hspa1b codes for an atp-dependent chaperone regulating intracellular anti-apoptosis, and is considered to be the most universal stress-induced hsp  <cit> . in baboons, expression of hsp <dig> is proportional to severity of heat stress  <cit> .

some of the differentially expressed hsps at tc,max are also found in the extracellular environment , where they are thought to have immunogenic functions   <cit> . putative mechanisms for hsp release into biofluids include cell death, active non-classical secretory pathways, lysosome-endosome pathways, release by secretory-like granules, or insertion into the lipid bilayers of export vesicles. the protein product of extracellular hsp <dig> binds to cd <dig>  toll-like receptor   <dig>  and cd <dig> on dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages  and induces expression of nf-κb and chemokines  by a tlr 2/4-dependent mechanism  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether products of the differentially expressed hsp genes in this study are actually released into the extracellular space in our heat stress model.

the apoptosis pathway was also significantly enriched in the kegg analysis. in the heart, liver, and kidney, activating transcription factor  <dig>  was significantly induced . the protein product of atf <dig> is a member of the atf/cyclic amp response element-binding  family of transcription factors  <cit> . the product of atf <dig> is a critical negative regulator of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to tlr activation  <cit> . atf <dig> knockout mice exhibit no developmental abnormalities  <cit>  unless challenged with lps or another stress stimulus, resulting in an overt susceptibility to endotoxic shock and death  <cit> . zfand2a, also known as arsenite-inducible rna-associated protein , was also up-regulated in all four organs in heated animals . in rats, zfand2a is closely associated with the febrile response, a heat-associated physiology. although early experiments in rodent fibroblasts suggested that zfand2a was induced by arsenite stress but not heat shock, later experiments in human cell lines demonstrated that zfand2a was induced by heat stress in an hsf-1–dependent manner and closely paralleled hsp <dig> expression after heat stress. while we can associate most of the members of the chsr with heat stress, a few genes are associated with other stressors and some are uncharacterized . up-regulated apoptosis-related genes included uspl <dig>  mgc <dig>  and dusp8
 <cit> . how the products of these genes contribute to the consensus response will require further investigation.

no transcripts were down-regulated in the chsr, although several transcripts were down-regulated in at least three organs and were near the threshold for the fourth organ. for example, cd <dig> was down-regulated in the liver, kidney, and lung, but was just below the two-fold significance threshold in the heart . cd <dig> codes for a cell surface marker in the tlr family that forms the receptor rp105/md <dig> and negatively regulates the expression of tlr <dig>  <cit> . reduction of the cd <dig> expression by heat stress may promote trl signaling and inflammation.

transcriptomic profile at  <dig> and  <dig> hours
our results at tc,max provide evidence of genes and functional regulatory pathways involved with the initial in vivo heat-stress response. most of the degs at tc,max in the chsr returned to control levels by  <dig> hours after heat stress . these results are consistent with the blood chemistries, suggesting that animals achieved recovery of most organ function by  <dig> hours. at tc,max and  <dig> hours, heat-stressed animals showed limited histopathological effects, although one animal showed evidence of liver histopathology at  <dig> hours . however, at  <dig> hours in three out of six animals, both histopathology and the pattern of gene expression indicated evidence of persistent, moderately severe damage to heart tissue.

we explored the patterns of gene expression in our experimental animals using self-organizing maps, and observed that the degs in the hearts of three out of six heat-stressed animals at  <dig> hours differed from both controls and the other heat-stressed animals . strikingly, these same animals also displayed cardioinflammation in the histological analysis. node a  contains  <dig>  down-regulated transcripts and node b contains  <dig> up-regulated transcripts . we next performed a functional analysis of the degs in nodes a and b using david, because these nodes were evident in the three animals with the highest histopathological scores. the down-regulated genes were associated with highly enriched kegg pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation , cardiac muscle contraction , and pathways associated with chronic proteotoxic stress . the oxidative phosphorylation pathway is central to parkinson’s disease, huntington’s disease, alzheimer’s disease, and cardiac muscle contraction, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction and disruption in energetics are key features in animals with heat-stress-induced heart injury. mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of er and membrane trafficking, alterations in protein folding and clearance, and activation of inflammation are all thought to be underlying causes of protein-folding disorders in neurons and other organ systems . primary and secondary aggregation of peptides and proteins disrupt normal protein homeostasis, leading to pathological states involving aberrant protein aggregation . a recent study shows a strong correlation between cytological evidence of aggregated proteins and the functional pathways we observed in our clustering analysis . further, supersaturated protein complexes in protein aggregates are associated with highly enriched ribosome and proteasome pathways. the ribosome pathway is enriched in genes upregulated in node c , cell cycle , and dna replication  . thus, the three animals with cardiac injury in response to heat stress show genomic signatures consistent with neurodegenerative diseases at the pathway level, suggesting that heat-injured animals have transcriptomic evidence of a greater propensity of protein to aggregate.figure  <dig>

proteomic analysis of heart tissue at tc,max,  <dig> hours, and  <dig> hours
to determine whether the pathway analysis was complementary at the protein level, proteins were extracted from heart tissue, analyzed by itraq , and compared with gene expression at all three time points. proteins and gene expression data were largely discordant at tc,max . this time point had significant enrichment in genes encoding proteins involved in the heat-stress response, especially the hsps . however, there were too few differentially expressed proteins at tc,max to derive functional clusters . although hsp <dig> and the gene encoding this protein were the most upregulated gene/protein pair at tc,max, hspb <dig> was the only other heat shock protein modulated in the protein data at this time point, and its expression decreased while the transcript encoding the protein product increased. proteins associated with serine proteinase activity were upregulated, including α- <dig> macroglobulin precursor and the acute phase protein α-1-inhibitor  <dig> precursor , but the transcripts for these products were below the fold-change threshold. both proteins are serum proteins and changes may reflect changes blood contamination not necessarily changes in the heart tissue itself. further, several mitochondrial proteins were modulated, including mitochondrial precursor hydroxyacyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase and mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit, but the transcript expression did not correlate with the protein expression.figure  <dig>

at  <dig> hours,  <dig> proteins were significantly altered , but few protein/gene expression pairs were in concordance . by  <dig> hours, multiple hsps were expressed above the fold-change threshold . however, all of the transcripts encoding the hsps which had been up-regulated at tc,max were either down-regulated  or below the fold-change threshold, with the exception of hspb <dig> . hsp90aa <dig>  hsp90b <dig>  and calreticulin precursor  clustered to the functional kegg pathway antigen processing and presentation , although their respective transcripts did not reach the fold-change threshold . the enrichment of the complement and coagulation cascades kegg pathway was driven by up-regulation of the proteins kng <dig>  kng <dig>  kng1l <dig>  c <dig>  f <dig>  and fgb, although there was not a complete correlation between transcript/protein expression level and direction .figure  <dig>

thus, at  <dig> hours environmentally inducible hsps remained elevated, despite a lack of blood chemistry or histopathologic evidence of injury. the hsps elevated at  <dig> hours are associated with cardiomyocyte injury and immune-mediated functions . hspa <dig> is an er-resident chaperone associated with hypoxia in cardiomyocytes  <cit> . hspa <dig> retargets to mitochondria and contributes to the mitochondrial unfolded protein response  <cit> . extracellular hsps associated with antigen processing and presentation have been associated with immune cell recruitment to cardiomyocytes, a potential mechanism of inflammatory injury  <cit> .

at  <dig> hours, we subdivided the animals based on histopathologic evidence of injury  or recovery . five hundred and twenty-one proteins were significantly altered in animals with histopathological evidence of heart injury , whereas only  <dig> were modulated in heat-stressed animals with no histopathological evidence of injury . the up-regulated proteins were enriched for pathways associated with protein folding  and, by extension, propensity to aggregate  <cit> . pathways associated with immune dysregulation were enriched . hsp expression correlated with transcript expression only in the heat-injured animals , not the heat-stressed animals . down-regulation of pathways enriched for oxidative phosphorylation, citrate cycle, and fatty acid metabolism suggested an energy crisis with massive mitochondrial dysfunction, supporting the observed necrosis in the cardiac histopathology. in addition, kegg enrichment analysis of down-regulated proteins identified pathways associated with chronic proteotoxic injury   <cit> . protein/gene pairs which showed concordant regulation in  <dig> hour heat-injured animals were diagrammed by subcellular organelle . most of the protein/gene pairs associated with mitochondria were associated with the oxidative phosphorylation, with nearly 100% overlap with protein/gene pairs in the kegg pathways of parkinson’s disease, huntington’s disease, and alzheimer’s disease. likewise, the heat shock proteins and proteins/gene pairs associated with proteasomal degradation were localized to the proteasome, including biomolecules in the immunomodulatory pathway antigen processing and presentation. the cardiomyocyte contraction pathway contained protein/gene pairs which were downregulated in conjunction with the sarcomere.figure  <dig>

protein aggregation and supersaturation by subcellular localization in heart tissue
supersaturation  of proteins has been associated with some of the kegg pathways we found modulated by heat stress. many of the kegg pathways we identified as enriched in heat-injured animals at  <dig> hours have been associated with neurodegenerative protein misfolding disorders, including oxidative phosphorylation , cardiomyocyte contractility, and proteasome  <cit> . in addition, proteins in these biochemical pathways have a combined high propensity to aggregate and elevated concentrations in proteotoxic diseases characterized with protein misfolding  <cit> . because heat induces protein misfolding and dysregulation, we investigated whether proteins affected by heat stress and heat injury had higher propensities to aggregate as a function of subcellular organelle localization .figure  <dig> 
preferential increase in propensity to aggregate in proteins modulated by heat stress at  <dig> and  <dig> hours with histopathological evidence of cardiac injury. median-corrected supersaturation scores  were calculated for proteins which changed  or remained unchanged in abundance as measured by mass spectrometry after heating as described by ciryam et al. <cit> .



the supersaturation scores for proteins modulated after heating at  <dig> hours and at  <dig> hours in heat-injured animals , but not at tc,max, was higher than for proteins whose abundance was unchanged at these time points. average supersaturation score of proteins modulate in animals without evidence of cardiac injury at  <dig> hours was also higher, but was not significantly different from the average for the unchanged proteins . these data indicate that:  preferential modulations in abundance of proteins with high supersaturation scores occur as early as  <dig> hours; and  proteins prone to aggregation are more likely to be regulated in cardiac injured rats than in animals that do not show histopathological evidence of injury at  <dig> hours. this suggests that protein aggregation is contributing to changes in protein abundance and perturbation of the biological processes associated with these proteins. further, aggregation as a result of heating is possibly a leading mechanism in the heat injury observed at  <dig> hours.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we present a global characterization of gene and protein response to heat stress in a conscious rat model that provides new insight into the regulatory processes associated with heat stress and recovery. 1) transcriptional analyses of the heart, lung, liver, and kidney at tc,max revealed a consensus heat stress-induced gene response that was enriched for genes related to protein folding and the regulation of apoptosis. 2) we used self-organizing maps to group genes into clusters of similar expression profiles in animals with evidence of similar histopathologies. in the hearts of three animals at  <dig> hours, significantly enriched oxidative phosphorylation, parkinson’s disease, huntington’s disease, antigen processing and presentation, and cardiac muscle contractility kegg pathways were consistent with protein-folding disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, and perturbation in cellular energetics. 3) transcriptional responses were corroborated by the results of proteomic analysis in heat-injured cardiac tissue at  <dig> hours, with pathway analysis, protein aggregation scores, and subcellular localization supporting up-regulation of proteins and genes in ribosome, antigen processing and presentation, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, complement and coagulation cascade, and pentose phosphate pathway, and downregulation of hypertrophic/dilated cardiomyopathy, fatty acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation . proteins involved in antigen processing and presentation emerge as early as  <dig> hours. disruption in these mitochondrial mediators and deficits in pathways related to energetics precede large changes in mediators of oxidative phosphorylation and protein folding disorders by  <dig> hours in heat-injured cardiac tissue. 5) supersaturation scores indicated an increased propensity to aggregate in proteins changing in abundance after heat stress at  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours. increased propensity to aggregate at  <dig> hours in animals with histopathological evidence of heat injury was more pronounced than in animals without cardiac injury. disruption in protein folding and the resulting aggregation is likely to contribute to the persistent subcellular indicators of energy crisis and regulation of apoptosis observed in heat-injured animals.

the fischer  <dig> strain was chosen because they do not gain body weight as quickly as sprague–dawley, which can have a large impact on thermal dynamics. it is possible that naturally occurring lesions in the heart were exacerbated by heat stress, however, only those with severe lesions were correlated with animals that demonstrated both gene and protein alterations . it is important to note that many humans have pre-existing conditions leading to heat susceptibility, and it is possible to extrapolate our findings to these populations. given that most heat stroke deaths occur in the elderly, this would be particularly relevant to those populations, although not exclusive. future studies should attempt to corroborate the findings of our study using rat strains less susceptible to the congenital cardiomyopathy phenotype. further, intermediate time points between tc,max,  <dig> hours, and  <dig> hours should be investigated to more accurately chronicle the initiation and progression of organ injury in the heart. however, our model may prove useful in identifying and understanding mediators of heart injury after heat stress in susceptible individuals.

this work in heat-stressed animals provides the basis for an assessment of global gene and protein responses in future heat-stroke–induced organ injury experiments. top-down integration of heat-induced changes in metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics  will provide the foundation for a computationally based linkage to human three-dimensional thermoregulation models. anchoring these systemic stress responses to the physiological model of heat stroke will provide further insight into predicting risk, severity, and timing of organ injury in response to hyperthermia. such a model will potentially accelerate the development of strategies to improve prevention, classification, and treatment of heat-related illnesses.
