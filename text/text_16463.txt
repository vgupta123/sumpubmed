BACKGROUND
the plant receptor-like kinases  are a large group of signalling proteins in plants, and are a fundamental part of plant signal transduction. in arabidopsis the rlk family contains more than  <dig> members, constituting 60% of kinases, including almost all of the transmembrane kinases  <cit> . the position of rlks in the plasma membrane, with an extracellular receptor domain and an intracellular kinase domain, makes them well suited to the task of perceiving a signal external to the cell and conducting that signal into the cell in order to elicit a response. in addition to rlks there are a number of receptor-like proteins . these proteins contain an extracellular domain similar to a rlk but lack the intracellular kinase domain  <cit> . based on the criteria of extracellular domain structure and kinase domain phylogeny, rlks are divided into subfamilies  <cit> . the somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase  gene family belong to the leucine-rich repeat  subfamily of rlks. these rlks contain varying numbers of lrrs in their extracellular receptor domain. serk genes belong to subgroup ii  and contain five lrr domains  <cit> .

the family has been defined according to several factors. the first is the presence of  <dig> exons with conserved splicing boundaries and the tendency for each exon to encode a specific protein domain. secondly the serk amino acid sequence contains a particular order of domains from n to c-terminal: signal peptide , leucine zipper ,  <dig> lrrs, a proline-rich domain , transmembrane, kinase and c-terminal domains. the spp domain, containing the spp motif and the c-terminal domain are considered to be the characteristic domains of serk proteins  <cit> . although this is largely correct for annotated serk genes there is some divergence from the set criteria. the arabidopsis nik  genes share many similarities with serk genes. nik genes are so named because of their function in signalling during virus infection  <cit> . they are described as interacting with the nuclear shuttle protein  domain of the virus.

the first serk genes identified were linked to competence of cultured cells to form somatic embryos in carrot , orchard grass  and arabidopsis thaliana species  <cit> . since that time serk gene expression has been associated with somatic embryogenesis  and organogenesis in numerous species  <cit> . in arabidopsis five serk genes have been identified  <cit>   and the gene functioning in se is atserk <dig> . as understanding of the roles of the different members of the serk gene family has increased, it has become apparent that these genes function in diverse signalling pathways with roles from development to defence. the arabidopsis serk gene family is subdivided into two subfamilies, generated from an ancestral gene duplication event. the first subfamily consists of atserks  <dig> and  <dig>  and the second subfamily, atserks  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> .

atserk <dig> is required in conjunction with atserk <dig> for anther development and male gametophyte maturation, with double mutants lacking a tapetal layer and failing to develop pollen  <cit> . atserk <dig> and atserk <dig> ) function in brassinosteroid  signal transduction as components of the br receptor complex, through dimerization with brassinosteroid-insensitive  <dig>  kinase  <cit> . both atserk <dig> and atserk <dig> ) have been linked to programmed cell death, which can function in both developmental and pathogen defence roles  <cit> . what has emerged from studies of arabidopsis serk signalling is that these genes have a tendency to be redundant in pairs with different pairs working in different pathways. therefore single serk gene mutants show weak or no phenotype as a second serk gene can complement their function. different combinations of serk genes act in different pathways and these combinations vary according to the pathway. for instance, atserk <dig> and  <dig> can complement each other in anther development, where atserk <dig> is shown not to function  <cit> . however, atserk <dig> and  <dig> function together in br signalling, and atserk <dig> and  <dig> are redundant in the programmed cell death pathway. so far a function for atserk <dig> is not known.

in defence responses, atserk3/bak <dig> functions in pathogen-associated molecular pattern -triggered immunity through heterodimerization with the flagellin sensing  <dig>  receptor kinase in response to binding by the bacterial pamp, flagellin  <cit> . a rice serk, osserk <dig>  shows activity in both somatic embryogenesis and fungal defence  <cit> . the concept of a receptor functioning in both development and pathogen response pathways is reminiscent of the toll receptor of drosophila, also an lrr protein, which is a controlling factor in both embryo development and immunity  <cit> . similarly erecta in arabidopsis functions in inflorescence and fruit development as well as pathogen resistance  <cit> .

the ability of atserks to be essential to a number of diverse pathways, receptive to both peptide and steroid ligands, poses the question as to how these similar proteins can show such diversity of function. one possibility is that they are not the primary ligand-binding receptor protein, but instead dimerize with other rlk proteins that are specifically targeted to the one response pathway; for example, the bri <dig> rlk in the case of br signalling, or the fls <dig> rlk in immune response to bacterial infection  <cit> . there is also evidence that atserk proteins may function in the process of endocytosis of the active receptor complex following ligand binding  <cit> .

in the model legume m. truncatula we have studied mtserk <dig> in relation to se and other aspects of development  <cit>  but no additional information is available in legumes on other members of the serk family. legume species comprise some of the world's essential crops for both human and animal nutrition, as a source of biofuels and are of ecological importance due to their ability to form symbiotic relationships with rhizobium species and fix atmospheric nitrogen  <cit> . in this study we have identified members of the serk family in m. truncatula and soybean  and analysed their phylogeny in relation to development and defence. in the case of mtserk <dig> a number of transcripts have been identified by pcr, consistent with the presence of splice variants, and this is discussed in relation to mtserk <dig> function.

RESULTS
serk genes identified in m. truncatula
using degenerate pcr from various tissues and database mining we identified eight putative serk genes in m. truncatula, in addition to the already characterized mtserk <dig> . degenerate pcr did not detect any serk-like sequences that were not also found using database searches. based on our analysis these genes were named mtserk 2- <dig> and mtserk-like 1- <dig> . five of the genes had one or two corresponding tentative consensus  or est sequences on the dfci medicago gene index  but none of these represented full length coding sequences. the remaining three genes  matched genomic dna sequences but had no corresponding ests. of the eight predicted genes, five  occur in tandem over a  <dig> kb region on chromosome  <dig> . the other three occur on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . pcr amplification of cdna from various tissues and sequencing were used to obtain the full length coding sequence of each of the eight identified genes. for one of these genes, seven different cdna sequences were amplified using nested pcr and sequenced. the presence of these different sequences is consistent with the presence of splice variants. blastp searches of all of the predicted amino acid sequences of the putative serk genes on the ncbi database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov showed mtserks 2- <dig> have high similarity to atserk <dig>  the other three mtserkl genes are similar to serks from various species, but in arabidopsis, mtserkl <dig> and mtserkl <dig> are more similar to nik genes. the homology of the m. truncatula serk and serkl sequences with each other and with arabidopsis serk and nik sequences is shown in additional file  <dig> 

probeset id
summary of serk and serkl genes in m. truncatula including splice variants  of mtserk <dig>  gene name refers to the final name given to each gene. the genomic identifier is the genbank number of the genomic sequence containing each gene. chr is chromosome number. tc/est identified refers to any matching tc or est sequence found on the dfci medicago gene index at the time the eight new genes were first identified. these numbers have since been updated and sometimes divided into separate sequences. current tc number shows the current corresponding tc numbers for each sequence. no. of ests on dfci is the number of ests used to compile each tc sequence on the dfci medicago gene index. detected on degenerate pcr indicates which sequences we found using that technique. matching probeset id on mtgi indicates the corresponding probeset on the m. truncatula gene expression atlas. chr pos is the gene position in kilobase pairs  on each chromosome established from cvit blast searches. gene loci indicates the gene locus number/s present at each site. splice variant  numbers of the  <dig> mtserk <dig> svs are given. genbank numbers apply to full-length mrna sequences deposited on the ncbi database. length, molecular weight  and pi values of predicted protein sequences are shown.

in order to determine the chromosomal position of each gene genomic full-length coding sequences plus several hundred bases 5' and 3' of each gene were used for a cvit blast search of the m. truncatula pseudomolecule: mt <dig>  database. each of the medicago serk and serkl genes, except for mtserk <dig>  showed 100% match to the database, and the position of these is shown in table  <dig>  mtserk <dig> is not present on this database, with its closest match corresponding to part of mtserk <dig> sequence on chromosome  <dig>  the gene loci numbers are also shown in table  <dig>  with mtserks <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> each occupying two loci.

predicted motifs in medicago genes and comparison with arabidopsis serks
the positions of the different serk domains in arabidopsis serks are indicated above the sequence alignment in figure  <dig>  all of the m. truncatula sequences except for mtserk <dig> have a predicted signal peptide. mtserk <dig> is predicted to be secreted in a non-classical manner. the consensus sequence of a leucine zipper leu-x6-leu-x6-leu-x6-leu, where x is any residue  <cit>  is present in mtserks  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  it is absent in the remaining m. truncatula serk-like proteins and is also absent in arabidopsis serks  <dig> and  <dig> as well as the three arabidopsis niks. all of these proteins have partial leucine zipper sequences, with the first leu-x6-leu sequence intact, but lack other conserved leucines and/or have extra residues between conserved leucines . the positions of the five serk lrrs are indicated in figure  <dig>  there is good alignment of the lrrs with the exception of lrr  <dig> in the three medicago serkl proteins. the spp domain is not well conserved. the serk-characteristic spp motif, highlighted yellow in figure  <dig> is not present in all serk proteins with atserks  <dig> and  <dig> lacking this motif. in m. truncatula the spp motif is present in mtserks  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  but is lacking in the other proteins. the medicago serkl proteins show the least amount of homology in this domain. all of the m. truncatula sequences contain predicted transmembrane and kinase domains. the genomic structure of each of the m. truncatula serk and serkl genes and the relative positions of the serk genes on chromosome  <dig> are shown in figure  <dig>  each of the genes contains  <dig> exons which is characteristic of serk genes. the gene encoding several putative splice variants is mtserk <dig>  one of the splice variants contains the usual serk exon structure with eleven exons as shown in figure  <dig>  the main variation in the gene structure between the different m. truncatula genes is in the length of the introns.

another characteristic of serk genes is conservation of exon boundary sites with the tendency for different protein domains to be encoded by separate exons  <cit> . the positions of each exon boundary site in each sequence are shown in figure  <dig>  each of the m. truncatula sequences identified and the arabidopsis niks have similar boundary sites to the arabidopsis serks, with the exception of atnik <dig>  which is missing two boundary sites, with a single exon encoding the equivalent of exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the other genes. the boundaries of greatest divergence occur between exons 6/ <dig> and 7/ <dig>  exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> encode lrr <dig>  the spp and the transmembrane domains respectively.

serk gene prediction from the soybean genome
soybean  has three genes annotated as serk genes on the ncbi database. however two of these sequences  are sequences from the same gene. the other sequence is genbank number eu <dig>  there is also one annotated nik gene in soybean . to identify other putative serk and serk-like genes in soybean, the mrna sequences of the m. truncatula serk and serk-like genes were blasted against the genomic sequence of soybean. fourteen more serk-like genomic sequences were obtained, and from these mrna and amino acid sequences were predicted.

phylogenetic analysis of legume serk genes
a phylogenetic tree was constructed from the predicted amino acid sequences of the m.truncatula serk and serk-like genes, the three soybean serk and nik genes present in the database and the fourteen soybean genes predicted from the soybean genome sequence. also included in the tree are all lrrii subgroup rlk-lrr genes from arabidopsis and serks from the ncbi database representing full length aa sequences from a number of other plant species . as indicated by the blast searches some of the m. truncatula sequences form a clade with the known serks. mtserkl <dig> and mtserkl <dig> fall into a clade with the soybean and arabidopsis niks. sequences of four of the predicted soybean genes also fall in the nik clade. one medicago sequence, mtserkl <dig>  along with three arabidopsis sequences and four of the predicted soybean sequences form a clade that is separate from the serk and nik clades . the four non-arabidopsis, non-legume sequences that fall in the nik clade  have been annotated as serks in the literature and/or on the ncbi database. this phylogenetic analysis shows that the five sequences from chromosome  <dig> that have been named as mtserk2- <dig> are part of the serk3/4/ <dig> family clade, with mtserk <dig> the only m. truncatula sequence in the serk1/ <dig> subfamily. one known and two predicted soybean sequences fall into the serk1/ <dig> subfamily. one known and four predicted soybean sequences fall into the serk3/4/ <dig> subfamily. together the phylogenetic and exon boundary results indicate high similarity between the serk and nik genes. the m. truncatula sequences have been deposited on the ncbi database .

mtserk <dig> transcripts
pcr analysis suggested a total of seven different transcripts consistent with seven splice variants of mtserk <dig> . the differences observed between the splice variants is that they either include an intron or introns in their sequence and/or are missing exon  <dig> . introns that are included as exons are introns  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  either alone or in combination. each of these intron sequences introduces a stop codon thereby creating a truncated coding sequence. splice variant   <dig> has the structure of a normal serk gene, containing  <dig> exons. sv <dig> is also full length except it lacks exon  <dig>  which encodes the first lrr. sv <dig> and sv <dig> retain intron  <dig>  with sv <dig> also lacking exon  <dig>  the remaining three splice variants lack exon  <dig> and retain intron  <dig> and its associated stop codon. sv <dig> and sv <dig> retain intron/s after intron  <dig>  but the three svs 5- <dig> encode the same protein sequence. together the seven svs encode five predicted proteins. although five of the sv sequences contain stop codons in introns  <dig> or  <dig>  the transcript continues through the remaining coding sections found in a typical serk gene. in these sequences a second possible transcript occurs with a predicted start codon in exon  <dig> in the region encoding subdomain iv of the the kinase domain. this sequence continues through to the position of the stop codon in exon  <dig> of sv <dig> . this was confirmed by sequencing in svs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in sv <dig>  sequence data was not obtained for sequence corresponding to most of exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> 

although the mtserk <dig> gene contains the typical  <dig> exon serk genomic structure and sv <dig> has characteristics of a typical serk transcript, there are some features that distinguish this gene from other serks. the first feature is the absence of a predicted signal peptide and the second is a truncated c-terminal domain, with the coding sequence terminating just after the kinase domain .

expression of medicago serks during the induction of somatic embryogenesis in culture
the apparent recent duplications of an ancestral gene to create the five serk genes on chromosome  <dig> raised the question of whether or not the five medicago genes are redundant in function of whether they have developed divergent functions. our previous work showed that mtserk <dig> expression is induced in somatic embryo-forming and root forming cultures  <cit>  and we were interested to know if other serk genes played a role in se. quantitiative rt-pcr  expression studies were conducted on these five mtserks in cultured m. truncatula tissue. relative expression was compared over a four-week time course in cultured leaf tissue from both the embryogenic 2ha seedline and the non-embryogenic jemalong seedline . the expression of mtserk <dig> was measured using primers that would amplify all putative splice variants of this gene. therefore expression shown is the sum expression of all splice variants. like mtserk <dig>  mtserks 3- <dig> are upregulated within the first week of culture and show similar expression in both the embryogenic 2ha and non-embryogenic jemalong genotypes. these results show that mtserk <dig> is not the only serk gene induced in culture at the time of induction of se. mtserks  <dig> and  <dig> are upregulated four to five-fold over expression in the starting leaf material and remain relatively high over the four weeks. this is a similar expression pattern to that observed for mtserk <dig>  <cit> . however, as the expression results for mtserk <dig> do not distinguish between splice variants, it is not known which or how many splice variants contribute to these expression levels. expression of mtserk <dig> and  <dig> are more significantly upregulated  within the first week of culture, then the expression decreases slightly  over the culture time measured. the variation in expression pattern between mtserk <dig> and the other replicated serk genes indicate some differences in function.

discussion
serk genes identified in m. truncatula
previous southern analysis indicated there are probably five serk genes in m. truncatula  <cit> , but we have now identified a total of eight serk or serkl genes in addition to the previously characterised mtserk <dig>  each of these nine genes contains  <dig> exons which is characteristic of serk genes, as well as the tendency for each exon to encode a specific protein domain. phylogenetic analysis shows that five of these genes are serks, belonging to the serk 3/4/ <dig> subfamily. the other three do not fall into the serk family as defined in arabidopsis, but rather are serk-like genes. two of them, mtserkl <dig> and mtserkl <dig> fall into the nik family, which is highly similar to the serk family. the third one, mtserkl <dig> is also closely related but is not in the same clade as the serk or nik genes.

the carrot serk does not contain a signal peptide, but rather starts from the leucine zipper . a perfect leucine zipper , is not present in atserks  <dig> and  <dig> and the specific spp motif of the spp domain is also lacking in these sequences . however, phylogenetic analysis favours the view that these are still serks  <cit> . the arabidopsis nik genes share many similarities with serk genes. several genes from other species that have been named as serk genes fall in the same clade as the nik genes . function has not been identified for the three arabidopsis genes that fall into the clade with mtserkl <dig> 

serk genes in legumes
although the m. truncatula genome is not yet fully sequenced, we have attempted to identify all serk genes in this species. from the identified serks, only one belongs to the serk 1/ <dig> subfamily , while there are five in the serk 3/4/ <dig> subfamily. this indicates there are probably not direct orthologues to the five arabidopsis serks. recently soybean became the first legume genome to be completely sequenced  <cit> . the soybean genome has  <dig> pairs of chromosomes and is a tetraploid, whereas the diploid m. truncatula genome has  <dig> pairs of chromosomes. it is estimated that the soybean genome underwent duplication around  <dig> million years ago and that any given region in the m. truncatula genome is likely to correspond to two regions in the soybean genome  <cit> . a search for candidate serk and serk-like known and predicted genes in soybean revealed  <dig> genes. phylogenetic analysis showed that three of these fall into the serk1/ <dig> subfamily, in comparison to one in m. truncatula. like medicago, there are five putative serk 3/4/ <dig> subfamily members in soybean. five members fall into the nik clade and four are part of the clade, containing mtserkl <dig>  separate to serk and nik.

in evolutionary terms, the closest legume to m. truncatula that has serk sequence information is lotus. the divergence of medicago and lotus is estimated to have occurred around  <dig> million years ago, after the divergence of soybean from medicago and lotus around  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the predicted gene in lotus which appears to be orthologous to the five serk3/4/ <dig> family member genes is a single copy gene, indicating that the medicago genes may have duplicated after the divergence of medicago and lotus. we estimate the duplication of the medicago genes occurred much more recently - from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million years ago. phylogenetically there are two soybean genes that are equally closely related to these five medicago serks  and gm15g05730; figure 3). these genes occur on different chromosomes and would originate from duplication of the entire soybean genome rather that duplication of a single gene. however, duplication has occurred on a less closely related soybean serk3/4/ <dig> gene, with two genes occurring in tandem on chromosome  <dig> . it appears that soybean had its own serk3/4/ <dig> family member duplication event after its divergence from medicago and lotus.

in the serk and serkl genes there is not a simple ratio of two soybean genes for every medicago gene, as would be expected from simple duplication of the soybean genome. it may be that not all of the medicago genes have been identified, especially those that are not in the serk clade. on the other hand, there is the likelihood of genome changes in both of the species during the past  <dig> million years to produce the gene compliment that is identified. full sequencing of the m. truncatula genome would be the only way to fully and conclusively elucidate the complement of these genes in m. truncatula.

serk and serkl genes in relation to development and defence
we propose the similarities between serk and nik genes in both structure and function indicate that these gene families, as well as other closely related lrr-rlks, form part of a larger gene superfamily that operates in signalling during plant development and defence. the families cannot be segregated based on developmental or defence function, with both families containing members in each type of role and some individual members operating in both pathways. for example, os <dig>  has a dual role in somatic embryogenesis and defence against fungal pathogens  <cit> , os <dig>  is linked to fungal defense  <cit> , so-called ppserk <dig> and ppserk <dig> , act in the early defining stages of apomixis  <cit> . therefore it may be advantageous to consider the wider serk/nik gene superfamily, encompassing all lrrii subclass genes, when looking at serk gene function in plants.

expression of medicago serks during the induction of somatic embryogenesis in culture
historically legumes have been difficult to transform and regenerate. the model legume, m. truncatula can be transformed and regenerated via somatic embryogenesis, but there is first a requirement for selection of an amenable genotype using tissue culture  <cit> . a role for mtserk <dig> during the establishment of embryogenic and organogenic cultures in m. truncatula was implied when it was shown that this gene is upregulated under these culture conditions. expression of mtserks  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , like mtserk <dig> is significantly upregulated in both 2ha and jemalong cultured tissue in comparison to expression in the starting leaf tissue , whereas the expression of mtserk <dig> remains constant throughout culture and in the starting leaf tissue. this variance in expression pattern suggests that mtserk <dig> at least, functions differently to mtserks 3- <dig>  mtserk <dig> and mtserk <dig> are the most highly upregulated serks in culture with both showing greater than  <dig> fold upregulation of expression in the first week of culture . the expression of the three medicago serkl genes stayed fairly constant in leaf tissue and in culture suggesting these genes are not part of the regulation of events in culture .

our intron analysis indicates that the mtserk <dig> and mtserk <dig> genes arose from the first duplication event, esimated to be  <dig>  mya. this raises the possibility that any function dependent on upregulation of mtserks  <dig> -  <dig> in culture evolved after the first duplication event which may be of significance when comparing the embryogenic capacity of different legume species. it was also noted that the promoter sequences of the five replicated m. truncatula serk 3/4/ <dig> subfamily member genes show greater sequence divergence between the members than the intron sequences . such a rapid change in gene promoters also supports the theory of functional divergence of these genes. in m. truncatula serk <dig> expression is associated with developmental change  <cit> . it seems likely that as in arabidopsis, heterodimers involving serk <dig> with other serks or other rlks help to regulate legume development.

splice variant
to our knowledge, the detection of sequences consistent with the existence of splice variants of mtserk <dig> is a novel observation for a serk gene. an understanding of as in plants is in its early days, but it is estimated that as occurs in about 20% of plant genes. what is known is the predominant form of as in plants is in the form of intron retention comprising around 50% - 60% of as events, with exon skipping comprising around 8%. this is quite different from the situation in humans where exon skipping is the predominant form of as  and intron retention comprises around 5%  <cit> . using sequence data from ests an attempt has been made to identify alternatively spliced genes in arabidopsis, rice and legumes and this information has been deposited on the asip  database at http://www.plantgdb.org/asip/ <cit> . as mtserk <dig> is one of the genes that had no corresponding ests on the database, it is not listed in the m. truncatula splice variants on the asip database. none of the five arabidopsis serk genes are listed as having splice variants. however, as events are recorded in other lrr-rlks, and in a separate study  <dig> alternatively spliced lrr-rlks were identified in arabidopsis  <cit> . as producing premature stop codons, such as svs  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> of mtserk <dig>  may produce transcripts that are targets for non-sense mediated rna decay  <cit> . however, ner-gaon   <cit>  presented evidence that transcripts with retained introns are exported from the nucleus and are associated with ribosomal complexes thus supporting the view that they may be functional.

the seven splice variant sequences observed in mtserk <dig> are predicted to code for five different proteins , including sv <dig> that has a regular serk-like structure. the structure of sv <dig> and sv <dig> gives these proteins structural similarity to the known rlps such as clavata <dig>   <cit> . the svs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  encode a single severely truncated predicted protein which contains the n-terminal, lacking lrr <dig>  with a stop codon introduced immediately after the position of lrr <dig> in a normal serk gene. this leaves the first two exons, encoding the putative sp and zip domains, then three lrrs followed by a stop codon. we have no knowledge of reports of a similar truncated lrr-rlk in the literature and it is quite conceivable that such a protein is targeted for degradation. on the other hand there are other defence proteins that are encoded by alternatively spliced genes where it has been shown that as of these genes is necessary to enable the defence function  <cit> . for example, the arabidopsis resistance to pseudomonas syringae <dig>  gene belonging to the toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor -nucleotide binding site -leu-rich repeat  class of disease resistance  genes is alternatively spliced to give both full-length and truncated proteins, and the presence of all of these proteins is required for disease resistance  <cit> . in general there is a bias for alternatively spliced genes with intron retention in plants to function in defence and external/internal stimuli-related functions  <cit> . additionally, in the mouse, members of the toll-like receptor signalling pathway show widespread alternative splicing, which is thought to allow a higher level of diversity in the inflammatory pathway in response to pathogens  <cit> . the already established role for serk genes in defence raises the possibility that some defence effect related to as could be operating in mtserk <dig>  of course such a role would need to be shown experimentally.

in keeping with a potential defence role, a recent study suggests that plant lrr-rlk genes can be grouped according to whether or not they have undergone gene expansion  <cit> . the authors propose that the expanded group share similarities with the nbs-lrr resistance genes in their genetic variation and evolution and are more likely to function in disease resistance, whereas the non-expanded group have a tendency to function in growth and development. the expansion of the five medicago serk3/4/ <dig> family member genes from a single ancestor may imply a role in defence for one or more of them. this observation along with the similar gene splicing to that observed in tir-nbs-lrr genes is supportive of a role for mtserk <dig> in defence. the rice serk1/ <dig> family member gene, osbiserk <dig>   <cit>   is one example of a defence related gene belonging to the expanded group  <cit> .

mtserk <dig> has other unusual features. one is its lack of a predicted signal peptide, although it is predicted to be secreted in a non-classical manner. the other is the truncation of the c-terminal domain in comparison to other serk proteins. the actual function of the serk c-terminal domain is unknown, but one possibility is a role in protein-protein interactions  <cit> . the distinct characteristics of mtserk <dig> may indicate a rapid evolution of different function after the gene duplication events which had created five genes from a single ancestral gene. the creation of extra gene copies relaxed selective pressure allowing some copies to evolve new functions, while at least one of the genes maintained the original function. however mtserk <dig> is still upregulated in tissue culture which also implies a developmental role during early culture events similar to that of mtserk <dig> and to other serks that were first described in relation to se.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have identified and sequenced the mrnas of five more serk and three serk-like genes in m. truncatula, and used these sequences to identify homologous genes in soybean. phylogenetic analysis shows that some of these genes fall distinctly in the serk family, while others are serk-like which include nik genes and other lrrii subgroup rlk-lrr family members. the m. truncatula serk3/4/ <dig> subfamily genes have undergone a gene duplication event that is not present in orthologous genes in soybean or lotus. one of these duplicated genes apparently encodes a number of sequences, consistent with the existence of splice variants, which is a novel finding for a serk gene. the gene duplication event and the presence of splice variants may be indicative of a role in defence, similar to that observed in nbs-lrr genes. other members of this replicated serk3/4/ <dig> gene cluster are upregulated in embryogenic tissue cultures implying a similar developmental role to that previously observed for mtserk <dig>  <cit> .
