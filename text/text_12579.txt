BACKGROUND
niemann-pick type c <dig> disease  is a lysosomal storage disorder induced by mutation of npc <dig> gene and characterized by neuronal degeneration . npc <dig> is a 13-pass transmembrane protein located in the late-endosome/lysosome and acts as a transporter for sphingolipid/cholesterol trafficking from the late-endosome/lysosome to other organelles and the membrane system  <cit> . the mutation of npc <dig> protein causes a progressive accumulation of unesterified cholesterol, phospholipids, glycolipids, and sphingomyelin in lysosomes of multiple tissues, leading to hepatosplenomegaly, tremor, ataxia, dystonia and neurodegeneration.

the npc1-mutant  mouse is widely used as an animal model to study npc <dig> disease. the npc1-/- mouse produces progredient neurological symptoms from postnatal day   <dig> and usually dies at about p <dig> days of age . at the cellular level in the central nervous system , the npc1-/- mouse shows an age-related loss of neurons, especially purkinje cells in the cerebellum and neurons in the cerebral cortex, as well as an increased activation of microglia and astrocytes in different organs and tissues, mimicking phenotypes of npc <dig> patients . gliosis and microgliosis have been shown to be especially dominant in the olfactory bulb, which contributes to olfactory deficits  <cit> .

the vertebrate retina is a multi-layer structure comprised of different types of cells. starting from inside, the innermost layer - the ganglion cell layer  is formed mainly by cell bodies of retinal ganglion cells  and displaced amacrine cells; the inner nuclear layer  is structured by cell bodies of amacrine cells, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and müller cells; the outer nuclear layer  contains cellular bodies of photoreceptors ; the inner plexiform layer  is formed by axons of bipolar cells, dendrites of ganglion cells and processes of amacrine cells, which can be subdivided into five parallel sublaminae ; the outer plexiform layer  between the inl and the onl contains axon terminals of photoreceptors, dendrites of bipolar cells and processes of horizontal cells  <cit> . all cells in the distinct layers of the retina cooperate with each other to transfer visual information through the optic nerve to the brain.

ocular involvement has been reported in a wide range of lysosomal storage diseases  <cit> . for example, in ophthalmological abnormalities, cornea verticillata and lens opacity have been found in fabry’s disease  <cit>  and optical atrophy in tay-sachs and sandhoff diseases  <cit> . degenerative changes in the retina have been observed in gaucher disease and α-mannosidosis  <cit>  and almost all parts of the eye have been affected in mucopolysaccharidoses  <cit> .

in the npc <dig> animal model, corneal alterations have been found and improved after a combined treatment with miglustat/allopregnanolone  <cit> . furthermore, signs of age-related maculopathies, including lipofuscin accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelial layer, photoreceptor degeneration in outer segments, and synaptic layer disruption in the retina, have been reported  <cit> , suggesting an essential role of npc <dig> protein in normal retinal function. in the present study, we further investigated individual cellular pathologies of the retina in the npc1-/- mouse. our results showed that electron-dense inclusions are accumulated in different types of cells, and ectopic processes of horizontal and amacrine cells form aberrant arborisation. furthermore, hyperactivity of glial cells is also revealed. the various patterns of alterations presented in our data suggest multiple cellular defects in the npc1-/- retina.

methods
animals
npc1-/- and control wild type  mice were bred using heterozygous pairs , purchased from the jackson laboratory . mice were killed by cardiac perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline , followed by 4% paraformaldehyde  in  <dig>  m pbs after deep anesthesia with pentobarbital. after enucleation, eyes were fixed in 4% pfa overnight, and stored at -80°c until further processing. at least  <dig> samples from different mice for each genotype were analyzed at p <dig>  all animal experiments were approved by the local ethics committee  and performed according to the rules and regulations of the local ethical committee and the care and use of the laboratory animals.

genotype analysis
for identification of mice genotype, genomic dna extracted from about 1 mm long tail of mice with phenol-chloroform was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction  according to the protocol described previously  <cit>  using the primers suggested by the jackson laboratory.

immunohistochemistry
fluorescent immunohistochemistry was performed on cryostat sections using the method as described previously  <cit> . primary mouse monoclonal, rat monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against calbindin , cd <dig> , glial fibrillary acidic protein , glutamine synthetase , alpha subunit of g protein , hexaribonucleotide binding protein- <dig> , neurofilament , npc <dig> , alpha isoform of protein kinase c , tyrosine hydroxylase , and a microglia marker  were used. all primary antibodies are specific to determine their target proteins, which were used as specific markers to identify different types or structures of cells. alexa 488-labeled  or cy3-labeled  secondary antibodies against mouse, rat or rabbit igg were used. fluorescence in sections was detected by a confocal microscope . digital images were adjusted in contrast and brightness with the photoshop software .

cell apoptosis analysed by tunel assay
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dutp nick end labeling  assay was performed on cryostat sections using the in situ cell death detection kit/tmr red  according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

transmission electron microscopy
for electron microscopy, the eyes were removed and fixed by immersion in  <dig>  m cacodylate buffer containing  <dig> % glutaraldehyde for at least 24 hours at 4°c. subsequently, the retina was dissected into quadrants, osmicated, washed, block contrasted with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in epon  <dig> . ultrathin sections  were mounted on pioloform-coated slot copper grids and contrasted with uranyl acetate  and lead citrate . the specimens were examined with a zeiss em  <dig> transmission electron microscope  at 80 kv. photographs were taken using a ccd camera  and adjusted using photoshop cs <dig> software .

RESULTS
npc <dig> expression and cell apoptosis in retina
we firstly analyzed npc <dig> protein expression by immunohistochemistry in the retina of p <dig> mice. endogenous npc <dig> protein in the npc1+/+ mouse was expressed strongly in the opl, which consists of the synapses among bipolar cells, photoreceptor cells, and horizontal cells, and by ganglion cells in the gcl . furthermore, signals were also detected moderately in the ipl, which consists of cellular processes of bipolar cells, ganglion cells and amacrine cells, and weakly in the outer and inner part of the inl, which contains horizontal cells and amacrine cells, respectively, as well as moderately in the outer part of the ipl . in contrast, in the npc1-/- mouse only weak npc <dig> background was found in the opl . taken together, npc <dig> protein was endogenously expressed by ganglion cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells, bipolar cells and their processes.figure  <dig>

we further evaluated cell apoptosis in the retina of p <dig> mice by tunel assay. only a few apoptotic cells were detected in the npc1+/+ mouse , but the number of apoptotic cells found in the npc1-/- mouse was significantly higher, especially in the onl and opl . however, the number of apoptotic cells found in the gcl of the npc1-/- mouse was very low, showing a similar pattern like the npc1+/+ mouse .

defects in retinal ganglion cells and electron microscopy findings
neurodegeneration including axonal and synaptic abnormalities in the brain of npc1-/- mice has been reported  <cit> . to examine effects of npc <dig> mutation on ganglion cells in the mouse retina, immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against neun for ganglion cell soma  <cit>  and neurofilament  for α-ganglion cell dendrites  <cit> . the results showed that the distribution of neun-positive neurons in both npc1+/+ and npc1-/- mice was similar, i.e., a large majority of neun-positive cells were located in the gcl and a few in the inner part of inl . however, semithin sections and transmission electron microscopy revealed that many ganglion cells in npc1-/- mice contained electron-dense myelin-like inclusions  when compared to the wild type mouse . furthermore, the expression patterns of neurofilament-positive dendrites by smi <dig> staining  <cit>  were different between the groups. in npc1+/+ mice, neurofilament-positive processes were strongly expressed in the gcl and moderately in the inner part of the ipl , but in npc1-/- mice, expression was strongly in the whole ipl , suggesting a defective arborisation of lamina-specific dendrites of ganglion cells in the npc1-/- retina.figure  <dig>

at the electron microscopical level, somata and processes of müller cells  and endothelial cells of capillaries  in npc1-/- mice were affected by accumulation of electron-dense inclusions, but not in the wild type mouse . however, despite the numerous autophagosome inclusions in endothelial cells, the tight junctions between endothelial cells to define the blood-retina barrier seemed morphologically unaltered . furthermore, photoreceptor cells located in the onl did not contain myelin-like materials in npc1-/- tissues  and the interface between inner and outer segments as well as the stabilizing ciliar apparatus remained intact , although earlier observation  <cit>  shows that we did not encounter disorganized membrane stacks of os.figure  <dig>

defects in horizontal and amacrine cells
horizontal cells, subtypes of amacrine cells as well as some ganglion cells in the retina are immuno-positive for calbindin  <cit> . generally, the distribution of calbindin-positive horizontal and amacrine cells was similar in the outer layer or the inner layer of the inl in both groups . amacrine and ganglion cells seemed to extend their projections to the borders of s <dig> to s <dig> in the ipl  in both npc1+/+  and npc1-/-  retinae. however, in the npc1-/- retina, some neurites of horizontal cells extended ectopically upwards through the onl and reached the outermost edge of the onl . remarkably, these dorsal-vertical extending neurites co-expressed neurofilament and exhibited axon terminal-like structures , suggesting that they belonged to axons of horizontal cells as described previously  <cit> .figure  <dig>

tyrosine hydroxylase  is a marker for dopaminergic amacrine cells in the retina  <cit> . in the npc1+/+ retina, th-positive processes of amacrine cells were found predominantly in the s <dig> sublamina of the ipl . however, in the npc1-/- retina, some stronger ectopic th-positive processes were found to extend to the inl and opl . furthermore, double immunostaining showed that ectopic th-positive processes of amacrine cells extending into the opl co-expressed calbindin , but not in the npc1+/+ retina , suggesting that ectopic processes formed synapses with calbindin-positive horizontal cells in the npc1-/- retina accompanied by a defective lamina-specific arborisation of amacrine cells in the opl.figure  <dig>

defects in bipolar cells
rod bipolar cells can be labeled by a specific antibody against pkcα  <cit> . in the npc1+/+ retina, rod bipolar cells, located in the outer part of the inl, had large dendritic arbors to make contact with rod photoreceptors in the opl  and formed axonal endings with large terminal end-bulbs in the ipl . in the npc1-/- retina, however, the dendritic branches were less profuse and some cells were almost devoid of dendrites . furthermore, axonal terminal arbors of rod bipolar cells were reduced in size . as a comparison, cone bipolar cells, which receive their input from cone photoreceptors via dendritic arbors, were immunostained with goα antibody  <cit> . our results  indicated that cell bodies of cone bipolar cells in the npc1-/- retina were ectopically distributed in the onl . although the intensity of the dendritic immunoreactivity in both types of retina was similar in the ipl , the dendritic arborization of goα-positive cells was thinner in the npc1-/- retina .figure  <dig>

activated glial cells
in the npc1+/+ retina at p <dig>  a few microglial cells were labeled with antibodies raised against f4/ <dig>  and cd <dig> , which are markers for microglial cells  <cit> . in contrast, in the npc1-/- retina, both number and size of f4/80- or cd68-positive microglial cells were increased in the ipl and the gcl from p <dig> onwards  and strong signals were retained at p <dig> . these microglial cells had a larger cell body with strong processes compared to the wild-type microglia , suggesting an increase of glial cell activity.figure  <dig>

for astrocytes, gfap-positive cells were limited to the gcl but their processes appeared weakly in the ipl in the npc1+/+ retina at p <dig> . however, in the npc1-/- retina, gfap signals were increased in the gcl from p <dig> onwards, and strong signals were found in the gcl and opl from p <dig> onwards . at p <dig>  gfap expression was strong in both cellular bodies of astrocytes and their inner processes .figure  <dig>

glutamine synthetase  is a protein that catalyzes ammonia and glutamate into glutamine and mainly exists in müller cells of the retina  <cit> . here, in the npc1+/+ retina, gs immunoreactivity was detected mainly in the cell bodies of müller cells , but in the npc1-/- retina, expression was predominantly found in the inner processes of müller cells, especially in the inner end-feet , showing a shift of expression from soma to inner end-feet.

defects in the optic nerve
the optic nerve comprises bundles of differently myelinated axons of retinal ganglion cells. myelination starts approximately  <dig> -1 mm after leaving the globe  <cit> . in npc1+/+ mice, the optic nerve was surrounded by a pial sheath consisting of collagen fibers , and the individual nerve fiber bundles were enveloped by processes of astrocytes . however, in npc1-/- mutants, we observed defects in myelination  as well as obvious and numerous autophagosome inclusions within partly extremely dilated axons , although some autophagosomes are seen in axons with normal myelin . oligodendrocytes  and astrocytes  were also affected, but astrocytes maintained connectivity to each other by morphologically intact gap junctions .figure  <dig>

discussion
in the npc1-/- retina, some disorders, e.g., reduced photo-transduction and photoreceptor synaptic transmission, degeneration of photoreceptor cells and increased autophagy in the gcl, have been described previously  <cit> . in the present study, our results extend previous findings  <cit>  to demonstrate the extensive aberrations, such as electron-dense inclusions accumulated in ganglion cells, bipolar cells, and müller cells , abnormal arborisation and misaligned dendrites of horizontal and amacrine cells , defective bipolar cells , and hyperactive glial cells .

the ganglion cells in the retina are important for transfer of light information from the retina to the brain. in this study, we show that the number and distribution of ganglion cell bodies in the gcl are similar in both npc1+/+ and npc1-/- retinae, however, the dendritic arbor distribution of ganglion cells in the ipl of npc1-/- retina is dispersed from the position of on-α-ganglion to off-α-ganglion . furthermore, alterations in myelination and numerous autophagosome inclusions in dilated axons of the optic nerve  are also found. these defects may contribute to reduced photo-transduction in npc1-/- mice.

horizontal cells and amacrine cells are interneurons that can synapse with photoreceptors, bipolar cells and ganglion cells in the retina, respectively  <cit> . the aberrant neurite outgrowth of retinal cells with ectopic contact formation is a common feature in mice with defective synaptic transmission from photoreceptor to bipolar cells  <cit> . under the degeneration condition, retinal cells can extend their axons and ectopically establish synapses with photoreceptors residing far from these cells  <cit> . here, we found that the horizontal cell processes, which normally synapse with photoreceptor axon terminals in the opl, ectopically target to the onl. furthermore, the amacrine cell processes also ectopically extend to the opl and form an aberrant connection with horizontal cells in the npc1-/- retina, suggesting that the stratification of retinal neurites is altered . different guidance molecules, such as semaphorins and plexins, control such neurite stratification in the retina  <cit> . for example, semaphorin3a, expressing throughout the retina and optic nerve during embryonic and postnatal stages  <cit> , is involved in the axon elongation of retinal ganglion cells  <cit> . genetic deletion of semaphorin3a results in defects of neurite arborisation, lamination and synapse formation  <cit> . interestingly, lipid rafts can mediate guidance actions of semaphorin3a and affect neurite outgrowth in the cns  <cit> . npc <dig> mutation causes alterations of lipid raft, inducing disruptions in the processing and functioning of raft-associated proteins on the plasma membrane of cells  <cit> . therefore, our data suggest that the neurite stratification in retina relies on, at least in part, npc <dig> function. whether npc <dig> is involved in the modulation of axonal guidance cues, e.g., semaphorins, during neurite stratification of the mouse retina should be further investigated.

activities of glial cells, including astrocytes, microglia, and müller cells, are up-regulated in the npc1-/- retina . displaced müller cells have been observed in experimental hypercholesterinemia in the ganglion cell layer of rabbits  <cit> , but occur also physiologically near the fovea centralis   <cit> . gliosis is a common feature for ongoing neurodegeneration and plays an important role in pathologies of npc <dig> disease  <cit> . therefore, our data suggest that hyperactivity of glial cells contributes to the development of neurodegeneration processes in the npc1-/- retina.

CONCLUSIONS
in the npc1-/- retina, accumulation of electron-dense inclusions, ectopic processes and defect arborisation were found in different types of cells accompanied by hyperactivity of glial cells, suggesting multiple cellular defects in the retina of the npc <dig> mutant mouse.
