BACKGROUND
mono adp-ribosytransferases  are an important class of enzymes that catalyse the transfer of the adp-ribose from nad+ to a specific amino acid residue in the target protein  <cit> . this reaction has been originally identified as the pathogenic mechanism of bacterial toxins, including cholera, pertussis and diphtheria toxin  <cit> . there is increasing evidence that endogenous arts also play important roles in higher animals and human  <cit> . so far, the family of mammalian arts comprises five members   <cit> . they are all ectoenzymes, anchored in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-tail with the exception of art <dig> which is secreted to the extracellular space  <cit> . among the five arts, only art <dig>  art <dig> and art <dig> exhibit enzyme activity whereas art <dig> and art <dig> appear to have lost their catalytic activity  <cit> . art <dig> was identified as the first mammalian art after protein purification from skeletal muscle and cdna cloning from rabbit  <cit> , human skeletal muscle  <cit>  and mouse lymphoma cells  <cit> . arts show a rather tissue-specific expression with art <dig> predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle  <cit> . art <dig> and art <dig> besides being abundant in testis  <cit>  are also expressed in muscle tissues.

in search of proteins being adp-ribosylated by art <dig> α7-integrin was identified as a key protein  <cit> . α7-integrin is expressed specifically in skeletal and cardiac muscle, forms a dimer with β1-integrin, and binds to laminin, an extracellular matrix protein  <cit> . adp-ribosylation has a positive effect on the interaction of α7/β1-integrin with its ligand, laminin  <cit> . it may represent a mechanism of upregulation of α7/β1-integrin function in situations where enhanced interactions are required such as muscle injuries or diseases  <cit> .

interestingly in mouse skeletal muscle cells, the expression of art <dig> correlates with the transition from nondifferentiated mononucleated myoblasts to multinucleated nonreplicating myotubes  <cit> . this step is controlled by a tightly regulated transcriptional program that involves two key transcription factor families: the basic helix-loop-helix protein  family  <cit>  consisting of myod, myf <dig>  myogenin and mrf <dig> and the myocyte enhancer binding factor  <dig>  family of the mads-box factors  <cit> .

mef- <dig> factors synergize with myogenic bhlh proteins to regulate transcription and myogenesis. the dna binding recognition sequence of the bhlh proteins is an e box, which is located in the regulatory regions of many muscle-specific genes  <cit> . mef- <dig> proteins bind as homo- and heterodimers to an a/t-rich dna consensus also found in the promoter regions of nearly every known muscle-specific gene  <cit> .

when analysing the promoter sequence from the art <dig> gene we found putative myogenin and mef- <dig> binding sites, suggesting that these factors may participate in the regulation of the art <dig> gene. using c2c <dig> and c3h-10t 1/ <dig> cell lines, we show that activation of the art <dig> promoter is associated with differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes. mutation and deletion analysis of the promoter revealed that myogenin and mef- <dig> binding sites are necessary and sufficient for transcriptional activity of the promoter. here we report for the first time that transcription factors activating the promoter of most skeletal muscle specific genes regulate transcription of art <dig>  an enzyme involved in posttranslational modification of adhesion proteins.

cell culture
the mouse c3h-10t 1/ <dig> mesenchymal progenitor cell line and stably myod transfected c3h-10t 1/ <dig> cells, here designated as myod-myoblasts, were obtained from dr. a. buchberger . cells were cultured in growth medium  consisting of dulbecco's modified eagle's medium , supplemented with  <dig> mm l-glutamine,  <dig>  g/l d-glucose,  <dig> u/ml penicillin,  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum . the mouse c2c <dig> cell line  was cultured in the same growth medium containing 20% instead of 10% fbs. proliferating myoblasts  were grown at low density to prevent differentiation.

fusion of myoblasts into myotubes was induced by growing cells to 80% confluence before replacing growth medium by fresh medium supplemented with 2% horse serum  instead of fbs or by growing cell at confluence for several  days in growth medium.

rna isolation and reverse transcription
total rna was isolated from c3h-10t 1/2- and c2c <dig> cells  and from quadriceps skeletal muscles  using the rneasy mini kit  according to the manufacturer's instruction. first-strand cdna was synthesized using  <dig> μg of total rna in a  <dig> μl reverse transcripton reaction mixture as described previously  <cit> .

polymerase chain reaction 
pcr reactions were performed as described previously  <cit>  with minor modifications. in brief, the following primer pairs were used: mart1-full-utr-fwd 5'-atc cca gga gac cag gtc ag-3' and mart1-full-rev 5'-gca cag ttg acc agc ctt ct-3'; β <dig> m fwd: 5'-ctg acc ggc ctg tat gct at-3' and β <dig> m rev: 5'-ttt tcc cgt tct tca gca tt-3'. amplification of art1- and beta- <dig> microglobulin  mrna was carried out at 61°c,  <dig> cycles and 60°c,  <dig> cycles respectively. the pcr products were separated by electrophoresis on  <dig> % agarose gels  containing  <dig>  μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized under ultraviolet light. the  <dig> bp ladder  served as a standard.

semi-quantitative real-time pcr
the reaction mixture contained  <dig> μl of the iq™sybr® green supermix,  <dig> nm forward and reverse primers and  <dig> μl of cdna template in a final volume of  <dig> μl. the list of intron-spanning primers amplifying art <dig>  art <dig> and art <dig> cdna is shown in table  <dig>  samples were run in duplicate in a  <dig> real time pcr cycler system . the reactions were performed under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig> s denaturation at 95°c,  <dig> s of primer annealing 60°c  and  <dig> s of extension/synthesis at 72°c. product quantification was optimal at 72°c, except of art <dig> . negative controls were performed with total rna or water as template. following pcr, the melting curve for each product was determined and the correct size calculated by agarose gel analysis. all cdna products were confirmed by sequencing to check their identity. calculations were carried out as described previously  <cit> .

treatment of cells with etheno-nad+
c3h-10t 1/ <dig> mesenchymal progenitors, myod-myoblasts and myotubes were harvested from  <dig> well cell culture plates by incubating cells with pbs/edta at 4°c. after washing cells were incubated in the presence or absence of  <dig> μm etheno-nad+ for  <dig> min at 37°c, followed by subsequent washing with pbs containing 10% haemaccel®  and  <dig> % sodium azide. etheno-adp-ribosylated proteins on the cell surface were measured by facs analysis as described previously  <cit> . the anti etheno-adenosine specific antibody 1g <dig>   <cit>  was kindly provided by dr. f. koch-nolte .

luciferase reporter constructs
genomic dna was extracted from mouse c3h10t 1/ <dig> cells. two fragments of the art <dig> promoter  were amplified by pcr using the upstream primers  luc-part1-l-fwd: 5'-ttt ttt ctc gag ttc tct cgc acc tcc ctt gt-3',  luc-mart1-s-fwd: 5'-ttt ttt ctc gag cca cca cca cca cag aac aa-3'  and  luc mart1-rev2: 5'-ttt ttt aga tct atg gcg ggc aaa gct gac ct-3' . both products were inserted in the promoter-, enhancerless pgl <dig>  basic firefly luciferase reporter plasmid . recombinant plasmids were isolated with the pure yield™ plasmid mini preparation system  and sequenced to check their identity.

site-directed mutagenesis of the pgl <dig> -part1-s reporter construct
the pgl <dig> -part1-s construct was used as a template in the quickchange® site-directed mutagenesis procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions . forward and reverse primers used to create the point mutations in the wild type e box and a/t -rich element were: mart1-mut-e-box fwd: 5'-cac att tct gag tgg ctc tgt ggc gac agc agg-3', mart1-mut-e-box rev: 5'-ctg tcg cca cag agc cac tca gaa atg tga cac-3'; mart1-mut-a/t-rich fwd: 5' caa gga gac aga gtg aac acg acg agt gtc aca ttt c-3' and mart1-mut-a/t-rich rev: 5'-gtg aca ctc gtc gtg ttc act ctg tct cct tgt caa g-3'. sequences shown in bold lower case represent mismatch bases introduced to obtain the desired mutation. following amplification, the reaction mixture was treated with dpni to eliminate the template dna. each of the mutated amplification products was transformed into the escherichia coli dh 5α strain. after having confirmed the desired mutations in the mutated promoter sequence the mutated promoter insert was subsequently cloned into a new pgl <dig>  plasmid to ensure that no unwanted mutations occurred in plasmid backbone.

transient transfection and luciferase reporter gene assays
all transfections were carried out with fugene6®hd  according to the manufacturer's instructions. for promoter reporter assays c3h10t 1/2-, c3h10t 1/2-myod- and c2c <dig> cells were seeded at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ <dig>  ml growth medium in a 24-well cell culture plate. to induce differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes, c3h10t 1/2-myod and c2c <dig> cells were seeded at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ <dig>  ml growth medium. cells were cotransfected with  <dig> ng pgl <dig>  vector or  <dig> ng promoter-reporter construct and  <dig> ng promoterless pgl <dig>   per well, respectively. each transfection was carried out in triplicate.  <dig> h after transfection the medium was replaced by fresh growth medium or differentiation medium . dual luciferase reporter assays were carried out  <dig> h after transfection in triplicate according to the manufacturer's instructions. the firefly luciferase activity was normalized to renilla luciferase activity in order to compensate variations in transfection efficiencies. the activity of the promoter-reporter constructs is given as fold induction compared with the activity of the pgl <dig>  promoterless plasmid.

electrophoretic mobility shift assay 
dna probes from the desmin gene e box, the n- <dig> gene a/t-rich element and the art <dig> gene e box and a/t-rich element  were generated by annealing the forward oligonucleotides listed in table  <dig> with the respective reverse oligonucleotides. fill-in labeling reactions were carried out with dctp  using the exo-klenow enzyme.

putative consensus sequences are indicated by bold letters. positions of exchanged nucleotides in mutated  dna probes are in italic, bold letters. lower case 'gg' denotes two added nucleotides used for fill-in labeling reactions.

c3h-10t 1/ <dig>  and c2c <dig>  cells were washed with pbs, scraped into ice cold pbs and centrifuged. cell pellets were incubated  <dig> min at 4°c in lysis buffer ,  <dig>  μg/ml leupeptin,  <dig>  μg/ml vanadat,  <dig> μg/ml pepstatin,  <dig> μg/ml aprotinin and  <dig> μg/ml naf) and subjected to vigorous vortexing. nuclei were collected and incubated with extraction buffer ,  <dig>  μg/ml leupeptin,  <dig>  μg/ml vanadat,  <dig> μg/ml pepstatin,  <dig> μg/ml aprotinin and  <dig> μg/ml naf) for  <dig> min at 4°c and subsequently sonicated for a few seconds.

clarified extracts were aliquoted and stored at -80°c. ten to fourteen micrograms of nuclear proteins were incubated with binding buffer  for  <dig> min at room temperature in the presence of  <dig> μg of poly  and  <dig> μl -labelled dna probe . to identify myogenin- or mef2-containing complexes,  <dig> μg of mouse anti myogenin mab  or  <dig> μg of anti mef- <dig> polyclonal antiserum  were added to the assay mixture. as a negative control  <dig> μg mouse igg <dig> antibody  or rabbit polyclonal igg antiserum  were used. protein-dna complexes were electrophoretically separated on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels at 10°c using  <dig>  × tbe  or  <dig> × tbe  as running buffer. gels were dried and labelled complexes were visualized by a phosphoimager system .

chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays
chip-assays were carried out using c2c <dig> cells  according to  <cit>  with minor modifications: magnetic dynabeads® coupled with protein-g  were used instead of agarose beads and the purification of dna fragments was carried out with the pcr-purification kit  instead of a chloroform/phenol extraction procedure. protein crosslinks were precipitated using  <dig> μg of a rabbit polyclonal anti myogenin antiserum , a rabbit polyclonal anti mef- <dig> polyclonal antiserum  or a rabbit polyclonal igg antiserum .

samples were analysed by pcr as described previously  <cit>  using following primers: chip-hprt-1-fwd: 5'-ctg cct ctg cct cct aaa tg-3', chip-hprt-1-rev: 5'-tgt cgt ctc cca gag gat tc-3'; chip-desmin-enhancer-fwd: 5'-tca gcc ttc ctt gac acc tc-3', chip-desmin-enhancer-rev: 5'-aca cca cgg gtt tgt gtt tt-3'; chip-mart1-fwd: 5'-ggg gtg atc aga gtc cag aa-3', chip-mart1-rev: 5'-gga ggg cag ctt tct ctt tt-3'. product amplification was carried out at 60°c with  <dig> cycles using  <dig> μl precipitated dna solution as template.

data analysis
following programs were used: the standard nucleotide-nucleotide blast  program  <cit>  to screen genome databases; neural network promoter prediction , available at bcm search launcher, to predict the art <dig> promoter region and transcriptional start site; clustal w software  <cit>  for multiple amino acid sequence alignment, and the tess program  to predict transcription factor binding sites and to browse the transfac database  <cit> .

RESULTS
expression of art <dig>  art <dig> and art <dig> mrna in myogenic cell lines during skeletal muscle differentiation in vitro
among the five mammalian arts, art <dig>  art <dig> and art <dig> have been shown to be expressed in skeletal muscle  <cit> . based on the finding that art <dig> was absent from c2c <dig> mouse myoblasts but appeared with differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes  <cit>  it was of interest to determine whether art <dig> and art <dig> followed a similar expression pattern.

real time rt pcr was carried out to measure art <dig>   <dig> and art <dig> mrna in the cell lines c3h-10t 1/ <dig> and c2c <dig> at various stages of differentiation. as seen in fig.  <dig> all three mrnas are expressed in c2c <dig> and c3h-10t 1/ <dig> myotubes. they are neither detectable in the c3h-10t 1/ <dig> mesenchymal progenitor cells nor, with the exception of art <dig> mrna, in c2c <dig> and c3h-10t 1/ <dig> myoblasts. thus art <dig> similar to art <dig> mrna is strongly upregulated during muscle cell differentiation. upregulation of art <dig> mrna was only observed in c3h-10t 1/ <dig> cells.

adp-ribosylation of cell surface target proteins during muscle cell differentiation is restricted to the myotube stage
in previous studies zolkiewska et al.  <cit>  showed that mono adp-ribosylation of cell surface target proteins of intact c2c <dig> cells was restricted to differentiated myotubes. to test whether this also applied to c3h-10t 1/ <dig> cells we incubated progenitor cells, myod-myoblasts and myotubes with etheno-nad+, an nad+ analogue that contains an ethenoadenosine moiety. the etheno-adp-ribosylated cell-surface proteins were visualized by flow cytometry using an etheno-adenosine-specific monoclonal antibody . fig.  <dig> shows that adp-ribosylated proteins are only present on differentiated c3h-10t 1/ <dig> myotubes whereas they are neither found on progenitor cells nor on the myod-myoblasts.

among the three arts being expressed at the myotube stage adp-ribosylation of surface proteins can only be attributed to art <dig>  art <dig> lacks any detectable enzyme activity  <cit>  and art <dig> can be excluded because it is secreted instead of being cell attached  <cit> .

to verify that art <dig> in contrast to art <dig> is enzymatically inactive we analysed hek 293-t cells stably transfected with art <dig> or art <dig>  only on art1-transfected cells adp-ribosylated proteins were detected .

structural and functional features of the putative art <dig> promoter
in contrast to the biological function of art <dig> nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating art <dig> gene expression in skeletal muscle cells. for this purpose we cloned and analysed the promoter of the art <dig> gene .

to verify the structure and length of the 5'utr of art <dig> transcripts from c3h-10t 1/2- and c2c <dig> myotubes and skeletal muscle tissue we performed rt-pcr analysis with primers amplifying the full-length 5'untranslated region  according to full-length data base ests entries  . respective to the transcription start site  a long  and a short  fragment of the putative art <dig> promoter region  were cloned into the pgl <dig>  basic firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. after transfection into c3h-10t 1/ <dig>  and c2c <dig>  cells the promoter activities were determined using the dual luciferase reporter assays. the putative long- and the short art <dig> promoter fragments only showed basal promoter activity in c3h-10t 1/ <dig> progenitor cells, c3h-10t 1/ <dig> myod-myoblasts and c2c <dig> myoblasts. however, the activities of both fragments were strongly upregulated after differentiation of the proliferating mononuclear myoblasts into non proliferating multinuclear myotubes . although compared with the short fragment, the long fragment showed an increased promoter activity, the major cis-regulatory elements which mediate the myotube specific upregulation of the promoter activity are located within the  fragment.

to identify conserved putative binding sites for transcription factors playing established roles in skeletal muscle cell development, the genomic sequences of the art <dig> proximal promoter from mouse, human and dog were aligned using the clustal w software program  <cit>  and analysed using the transcription element search system  program  <cit> . besides a classical tata box motive, analyses revealed the existence of two conserved cis-regulatory consensus sites, an e box motive  and an a/t-rich element  in the art <dig> proximal promoter regions .

the e box and the a/t-rich element play a role in myotube-specific art <dig> promoter activity
to gain insight into the functional importance of the predicted regulatory motifs in directing myotube-specific promoter activity, the core consensus sequence of predicted sites was altered by mutagenesis of the parental mouse proximal art <dig> promoter construct part1-s . c3h-10t 1/ <dig>  and c2c <dig>  cells were transfected with the plasmids and promoter activities were determined. as seen in fig.  <dig> the mutation of the  e box  as well as the mutation of the  a/t-rich element  results in a 90% decrease in the promoter inducibility in myotubes compared with the parental wild-type construct. double mutant shows residual promoter activity while the differentiation-specific induction is completely lost, indicating that indeed both motifs are of functional importance for myotube restricted art <dig> promoter activation. as both motives are in close vicinity a cooperative role of the transcription factors binding to those motifs might be expected.

binding of myogenin to the proximal e box during muscle cell differentiation
given the crucial role of the e box and the a/t-rich element in myogenic differentiation, we asked whether the functional properties of these sites are reflected by distinct dna-protein interactions. extensive analyses of skeletal muscle differentiation have shown that myogenic regulatory factors  of the basic helix-loop-helix proteins  family  <cit>  are involved in skeletal muscle development. these bhlh factors  bind as homo- or heterodimers with ubiquitously expressed e-proteins to a specific e box motive  <cit>  in prominent muscle specific promoters and enhancers. genetic studies indicate that myod and myf <dig> are necessary to specify the skeletal muscle lineage  <cit>  whereas myogenin appears to have a critical role in terminal differentiation of the specified muscle cells in vivo  <cit> . because art <dig> expression and the activity of the two cloned art <dig> promoter fragments are restricted to differentiated non-proliferating multinuclear myotubes, myogenin was considered a favourite candidate to bind to the e box in the proximal art <dig> promoter as a cis-regulatory factor. to test this hypothesis electrophoretic mobility shift assays  were performed using the  e box from the art <dig> proximal promoter as an emsa probe . as a positive control a probe containing a myogenin binding e box of the desmin gene promoter  <cit>  was used.

as seen in fig.  <dig> incubating nuclear extracts of c3h-10t 1/2- and c2c <dig> myotubes with the e box oligomer probe lead to the formation of a shifted complex that was not detectable in the presence of a mutated e box probe. the e box specific complex was supershifted by an anti-myogenin antibody but not by the corresponding isotype control confirming the specificity of the supershift. no supershift was observed when the experiments were carried out with nuclear extracts of myoblasts.

binding of mef- <dig> to the a/t-rich element during muscle cell differentiation
since the a/t-rich element in the art <dig> proximal promoter is crucial for its activation as demonstrated by the luciferase reporter assay, we aimed to identify transcription factors that may bind to this site. according to the tess program  myocyte enhancing factor  <dig> proteins , especially mef-2a, are predicted to be candidates. mef- <dig> binds to 5'-yta4tar-3'  <cit>  sequences in the regulatory regions of target genes. although the sequence of the  art <dig> a/t-rich element  does not completely match the optimal consensus sequence it may bind mef- <dig> protein.

to demonstrate binding of mef- <dig> proteins to the a/t-rich site we performed gel-shift experiments using synthetic dna probes of this element and nuclear extracts from c3h-10t 1/2- and c2c <dig> myotubes. as a positive control a probe containing a mef- <dig> binding site of the n- <dig> gene promoter  <cit>  was used. as shown in fig.  <dig> nuclear extracts from c3h-10t 1/2- and c2c <dig> myotubes interacted with the oligomer probes whereas no specific complexes were formed when extracts from myoblasts or mutated oligonucleotide probes of the a/t-rich elements were used. addition of an anti-mef- <dig> antibody resulted in a supershift indicating that mef- <dig> in fact interacts with the a/t-rich promoter region.

binding of myogenin and mef- <dig> to the art <dig> promoter during muscle cell differentiation in vivo
to confirm that endogenous nuclear myogenin and mef- <dig> bind to the proximal part of the art <dig> promoter in vivo, chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays were carried out with c2c <dig> myotubes and myoblasts. as seen in fig.  <dig>  both myogenin and mef- <dig> bind to the art <dig> promoter in myotubes, but not in myoblasts.

as a positive control the desmin gene promoter enhancer  <cit>  that contains a functional e box and functional mef- <dig> binding site and as a negative control the proximal part of the hprt- <dig> housekeeping gene promoter were used. whereas both factors bind to the desmin gene promoter enhancer in a myotube restricted manner, no binding to the hprt- <dig> gene promoter was observed.

discussion
the discovery of eukaryotic mono-adp-ribosyltransferases  is fairly recent  <cit> . although the chromosomal localization, genomic organization and expression of the five mammalian art genes are well understood nothing is known about the transcriptional control of these genes. the fact that three of the five mammalian arts namely art <dig>  art <dig> and art <dig> are highly expressed in skeletal muscle tissue made us analyse their transcriptional regulation during muscle cell differentiation in more detail. we used c2c <dig> and c3h-10t 1/ <dig> cells, which provide well-established and reproducible models of myogenesis  <cit> . we found that art <dig> and art <dig> expression was restricted to myotubes while art <dig> mrna was already present in myoblasts of both cell types but absent from c3h-10t 1/ <dig> mesenchymal progenitor cells. in previous studies we showed that the art <dig> promoter consists of three regions  and that the pβ promoter is preferentially used in skeletal muscle  <cit> . in line with these findings we observed an almost exclusive usage of the pβ promoter in c3h-10t 1/ <dig> myoblasts transfected with the transcription factor myod  suggesting that the promoter is a direct or indirect target of myod.

when defining the 5'bounderies of the art <dig> gene and comparing them to the 5'flanking sequences of the art <dig> gene glowacki et al.  <cit>  found that the two genes overlap at their 5'ends. since both genes are coexpressed in heart- and skeletal muscle and as shown here in non-proliferating multinuclear myotubes and since the muscle-specific transcription start site of the art <dig> gene overlaps with the 5'end of the art <dig> gene one could speculate that their expression is regulated by a common promoter or regulatory element. interestingly in testis, which contains art <dig> but not art <dig> mrna, the transcription start site of art <dig> lies outside the art <dig> gene  <cit> .

to understand the myotube specific expression of the art <dig> gene in more detail we cloned and analysed the art <dig> promoter. we identified a fragment spanning the nucleotide sequence from position - <dig> to + <dig> respective to the transcription start site  as a functional promoter. we identified an e box and an at-rich element in the promoter region, two binding sites for transcription factors with established roles in skeletal muscle development. by distinct dna-protein interaction we showed binding of the transcription factors myogenin to the e box and mef- <dig> to the a/t-rich element in vitro. we confirmed the binding of these factors to the proximal part of the art <dig> promoter in vivo.

extending the fragment to - <dig> resulted in an increase in promoter activity suggesting the existence of additional enhancer elements within the -3221/- <dig> region. indeed, by using bioinformatics tools we have identified four additional cis-regulatory consensus sites: an a/t-rich motif  and three e boxes ,  and ), which were only present in the long fragment of the mouse art <dig> promoter . these putative binding sites for mef- <dig> and bhlh-factors are potential candidates for enhancing muscle specific gene expression. such enhancer elements are frequently found in the promoter region of prominent muscle specific genes .

in addition to myogenin the other members of the muscle regulatory factors  family, myf <dig>  mrf- <dig> and myod are also expressed in skeletal muscle and play distinct but overlapping roles in regulating muscle cell development  <cit> . myod for example when introduced into c3h-10t 1/ <dig> mesenchymal progenitor cells is able to convert the cells into myoblasts and as shown here to increase art <dig> mrna expression. for art <dig> to become expressed it requires differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes. this process, which is achieved by removing serum from the cell cultures or by increasing cell-cell contact results in the activation of myod dependent transcription factors like myogenin  the latter being essential for art <dig> activation. together with myogenin, mef- <dig> proteins function combinatorially to activate art <dig> transcription. these data show that art <dig> expression is regulated in a similar way as the majority of skeletal muscle genes, which also require the coordinated activity of members of the two families of transcriptional regulators, mrf and mef- <dig> 

the myocyte enhancer factor  <dig>  belongs to the mads  family of transcriptions factors. mef- <dig> homo- or heterodimers bind an a/t-rich dna sequence 4tar-3')  <cit>  within the regulatory regions of several muscle specific genes  <cit> .

although the a/t rich dna sequence within the art <dig> promoter  does not reflect a perfect match with the mef- <dig> consensus sequence, mef- <dig> binds to the sequence in the art <dig> promoter. it contains the nucleotides tg at position  <dig> and  <dig> instead of an aa or at, an unusual nucleotide sequence for a mef- <dig> binding site. in case of a perfect mef- <dig> consensus sequence in the art <dig> promoter a sequence aaa tag-3') would result that contains a tata box. a tata box within the mef- <dig> binding site in the art <dig> promoter would only be - <dig> nucleotides upstream of the classical tata box  of the promoter. if this putative sequence was used, a premature transcription start or interference with binding of mef- <dig> could result. in either case a successful expression of art <dig> would be questionable.

mef- <dig> and myogenic bhlh factors play key roles in skeletal muscle development  <cit> . both factors physically interact as part of a combinatorial complex that results in synergistic activation of transcription and myogenesis  <cit> . cooperative activation is facilitated by the close proximity and coordinated positioning of the binding sites of myod and mef- <dig> on the same face of the dna in most muscle-specific promoters  <cit> . wright et al.   <cit>  found that mef- <dig> binding sites are frequently associated with functional e boxes bound by myogenin and that these sites are often positioned with precise spacing to allow both factors to bind dna simultaneously, which likely promotes protein-protein interactions by these factors  <cit> . here we show that the binding sites for myogenin and mef- <dig> in the art <dig> promoter are also located in close vicinity separated by a short spacer of  <dig> nucleotides, sufficient to allow both factors to bind to dna simultaneously. furthermore the finding that mutating either the e box or the a/t-rich element results in a 90% decrease in the promoter inducibility during differentiation and that a double mutant construct hardly shows any promoter inducibility implies a cooperative role of the two transcription factors in regulating art <dig> transcription during myogenesis.

to exert its effects i.e. to adp-ribosylated α <dig> integrin the art <dig> protein requires nad+. under physiological conditions the concentration of free nad+ in the extracellular compartment is in the submicromolar range  <cit>  too low to attain significant activities. an increase could occur as a consequence of cell lysis during an infection or tissue injury or due to membrane injuries as a result of metabolic and mechanical stress . once activated, art <dig> adp-ribosylates α7-integrin, which together with β1-integrin binds to laminin. as adp-ribosylation leads to an increased ligand binding, it may represent a mechanism of upregulation of α7β1-integrin function in vivo in injured or diseased muscle upon loss of plasma membrane integrity and efflux of nad+  <cit> .

the data presented here demonstrate that expression of the art <dig> gene during myogenesis is under control of myogenin and mef- <dig>  two transcription factors critical for the activation of many skeletal muscle specific genes. having identified the art <dig> promoter it will be of interest if genetic defects and polymorphisms in the art <dig> gene are associated with degenerative muscle diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
the ectoenzyme art <dig> is predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. it adp-ribosylates α7-integrin, a cell surface protein of myotubes, which has a positive effect on the interaction of the α7β <dig> dimer with its ligand laminin  <cit> . using c2c <dig> and c3h-10t 1/ <dig> cells as a model of myogenesis we found that activation of the art <dig> gene was restricted to the myotube stage. we identified the art <dig> promoter and showed that it is regulated by the two transcription factors mef- <dig> and myogenin, which play an essential role during muscle cell differentiation in the regulation of muscle-specific genes. an understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the art <dig> gene should facilitate a better understanding of the regulation of art <dig> expression under physiological and pathological conditions.
