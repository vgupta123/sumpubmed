BACKGROUND

symplocos paniculata, a member of symplocaceae, is a woody oil plant native to china with notable ecological and economic importance  <cit> . s. paniculata has a high adaptability to different temperature zones and varying soil conditions. it grows well in barren, salty, and severe drought soil like marginal land and arid areas  <cit> . a mature tree can yield up to 20 kg fruit  <cit> . the whole fruit contains  <dig> % oil  <cit> , of which  <dig> % is unsaturated fatty acid. due to high fruit yield and oil content, s. paniculata serves as an ideal feedstock for bio-diesel and edible oil production  <cit> . s. paniculata also has other industrial uses such as ink surfactants, lubricants, and soap. however, oil production from s. paniculata fruits is still limited. there is an urgent demand for developing novel cultivars with improved oil yield and quality for biodiesel and edible oil production.

like avocado, oil palm, and olive, s. paniculata accumulates copious amount of oil in both seed and mesocarp of the fruit  <cit> . oil is mainly stored as triacylglycerols  in oil bodies in seed or in oil cells in the mesocarp of the fruit  <cit> . the oil yield and quality in developing fruits is regulated by a number of enzymes that take part in lipid biosynthesis. lipid biosynthesis consists of fatty acid synthesis and tag assembly at multiple subcellular organelles, and its transcriptional regulatory patterns varied with plant species  <cit> . previous studies reported genetic manipulation has been used to increase tag yield and quality   <cit> . however, the overall expression and regulation profiles of genes involved in the lipid biosynthesis of s. paniculata still remain unclear. it is essential to identify key genes that are related to lipid biosynthesis in the fruit development of s. paniculata. if such genes are identified, molecular breeding would increase the fruit oil content and improve fatty acid composition.

rna-seq is one of the next generation sequencing technologies that has developed in recent years and created unprecedented opportunities for generating genomic or transcriptomic information. it is widely used for exploring functional genes  <cit> , constructing expression and transcriptional regulatory profiles  <cit> , discovering molecular markers such as simple sequence repeats  and single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> , and investigating comparative and evolutionary genomics  <cit> . this technique is efficient to generate a large amount of genetic data. since the generated reads can assemble without a reference genome, it is also an ideal tool for transcriptome sequencing for those species without a sequenced genome  <cit> . recently, rna-seq has been used to analyze the transcriptomic profiles of oil accumulation in oil plants such as jatropha   <cit> , oil tea   <cit> , oil palm   <cit> , peanut   <cit> , rapeseed   <cit> , and sesame   <cit> . however, the functional genes involved in the oil biosynthesis and metabolism of s. paniculata are not yet to be investigated.

in our study, transcriptome analysis of s. paniculata was conducted using illumina high-throughput sequencing platforms  <dig>  rna extracted from fresh fruits at four different development stages  was pooled as a sample to establish a cdna library. the objectives of this study were to:  investigate the functional unigenes encoding vital enzymes associated with lipid biosynthesis and metabolism;  identify the annotation of complete transcriptome to the functional unigenes;  reconstruct the fatty acid  and triacylglycerol  pathways using the identified enzymes;  determine the up- or down-regulated enzymes through the comparison of gene expression at different stages of oil accumulation; and  validate the key genes through quantitative real-time pcr . these results would help enrich the public database with a large number of sequences. they also benefit breeding efforts in increasing oil content, in modifying fatty acid composition, and in other target characteristics using genetic engineering approaches.

methods
plant materials and rna extraction
the fruits of s. paniculata from accession c <dig> were collected every 10 days after flowering  in  <dig> from the experimental station at hunan academy of forestry, changsha, hunan, china . these sampling was discontinued at  <dig> daf because fruits started to shed. the fruit oil content was determined according to chinese national standard methods gb/t 5512- <dig>  <cit>  with a sze-101fat analyzer . in brief, fruits were dried at 70 °c for  <dig> days, and approximately 4 ~ 5 g of fruits were grounded into powder. powder samples were weighed  and extracted in a petroleum ether  as solvent at  <dig>  °c for  <dig> hours. the residual was dried at 105 °c in vacuum for  <dig> hours and weighted . the total fruit oil content  was calculated as follows: % = /w0 × 100%.

fatty acid components of the fruit oil was analyzed using clarus  <dig> gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer . the samples were saponified first and then injected into a free fatty acid polyester  column . oven temperature was programmed as follows: held at 40 °c for 1 min, increased to 100 °c at 20 °c per minute and held at 100 °c for 2 min, increased to 220 °c at 20 °c per minute and held at 220 °c for 2 min, increased to 280 °c at 20 °c per minute and held at 280 °c for 5 min. carrier gas, helium , was provided at a flow rate of  <dig>  per minute in the column. the injector temperature was 250 °c, and the injection volume was 1 μl. gc and ms interface temperature and ion source temperature was  <dig> and 230 °c, respectively. electron impact energy of mass spectrometer was 70 ev, and scanning quality ranged from  <dig> to 500 amu. the fatty acid components were identified using the wiley mass spectral library  <cit> . relative percentage of fatty acid compositions was determined on the basis of the peak areas.

according to the dynamic pattern of oil accumulation, the fresh fruits at four representative developmental stages  from the same tree were selected as the experimental materials for transcriptomic analysis . fresh fruits were removed from the mother tree and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °c for rna extraction.

fresh fruits  from each time-point were then grounded into powder using liquid nitrogen. total rna was isolated and purified separately according to the manufacturer’s protocol using the spin column plant total rna purification kit . extracted rna was quantified using a nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer  and agilent bioanalyzer  <dig> system . the 260/280 nm ratio of samples ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and the average rna integrity number  was over  <dig>  all the results showed that the extracted rna was of high quality without any apparent degradation and was suitable for further cdna synthesis and rna-seq.

cdna library construction and illumina sequencing
the cdna library was constructed from a mixed rna pool using illumina truseq rna sample preparation kit . according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, the poly- mrna was isolated from the total rna using oligo  beads. the mrna was chopped into short fragments using a fragmentation buffer. the first-strand cdna was generated by reverse transcription using a random hexamer-prime, whereas the second strand of cdna was synthesized with the ligation of the adaptor including dna polymerase i and rnase h. subsequently, the cdna fragments of approximately 200 bp in length were selected using gel electrophoresis and amplified through 15-cycle pcr. enriched cdna fragments were purified and quantified using agilent bioanalyzer  <dig> system.

the cdna library was sequenced on the high-throughput illumina sequencing platform . all adapter sequences including low-quality sequences  and reads with more than 10% q <dig> bases were filtered out of data , and the remaining reads were denoted as clean reads. all clean reads were assembled into unigenes with trinity software   <cit> . all high-quality reads were deposited in the national center for biotechnology information  short read archive  database .

functional unigenes annotation
assembled unigenes were annotated using blast alignment with an e value threshold of 10− <dig> against the following four public protein databases: non-redundant  protein database, gene ontology  protein database  <cit> , clusters of orthologous groups  protein database  <cit> , and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  protein database  <cit> . each assembled sequence was given a gene name based on the best blast hit . but this search was limited to the first  <dig> significant hits for each query in order to increase the computational speed. the open reading frame  of the unigenes without blast hits were predicted using estscan   <cit> . the best blast hit from the nr database for each transcript was submitted to blast2go platform   to retrieve go terms for each unigene based on the relationship between gene names and go terms. ec number was also assigned and passed based on the blast2go results. moreover, the sequences with designated ecs obtained from blast2go were mapped to the kegg metabolic pathway database to understand the functional unigenes involved in metabolic pathways. kegg automatic annotation server   <cit>  and kegg orthology based annotation system    <cit>  were used to automatically annotate the unigenes that code for known orthologues of plant enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid degradation, tag biosynthesis, and tag degradation pathways.

differential expression of unigenes
differentially expressed unigenes  were screened using differentially expressed sequencing  method  <cit> . the unigenes expression levels were statistically calculated using reads per kilobase transcriptome per million mapped reads   <cit> . the rpkm method was used to normalize the abundances of transcripts to eliminate the influence of different gene lengths and sequencing discrepancies on the gene expression calculation. a 3-fold difference of rpkm was used to identify the genes differentially expressed between two developmental stages. and degs were functional annotated in go and kegg database.

quantitative rt-pcr validation
six unigenes involved in different lipid metabolism pathways with different regulation modes were selected for the validation using real time qpcr. the gene-specific primer pairs were designed using primer premier  <dig>  software . total rna was isolated from fruits sampled at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> daf as the description mentioned above. cdna was synthesized using the sybr premix ex taq kit  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. relative mrna abundance of the selected genes was determined using multicolor real-time pcr detection system . the actin-related protein  <dig>  and 18s rrna were chosen as an internal control for normalization. the conditions for all reactions were 95 °c for 2 min, 40 cycles of 95 °c for 15 s, followed by 60 °c for 15 s, and 95 °c for 15 s. three technical repetitions were performed for qrt-pcr. the relative expression level of qpcr results for each unigene was calculated using the comparative cycle threshold  method  <cit> . correlation analysis between rpkm with ΔΔct was performed using jmp .

RESULTS
temporal pattern of oil accumulation and fatty acid compositions
the temporal pattern of oil accumulation and fatty acid compositions in the fruit of s. paniculata at four different development stages were investigated. there was a little oil accumulated  in the fruit of s. paniculata from  <dig> to  <dig> daf, but a most noticeable change in the fruit oil content happened during the period of  <dig> to  <dig> daf, when an average of  <dig> % oil accumulated every day. thereafter, the oil content still gradually increased till  <dig> daf when the maximum fruit oil content  was reached . the oil content of s. paniculata fruit might keep increasing after  <dig> adf, however, its fruits started to shed at  <dig> daf and the sampling was discontinued. therefore, the oil content at  <dig> adf was determined as the maximum oil content during the fruit developmental stages. the fruit oil was mainly composed of saturated fatty acid such as palmitic acid  and stearic acid  and unsaturated fatty acid such as oleic acid , linoleic acid , and linolenic acid . oleic acid  was the major component of the fruit oil, and up to  <dig> % of c18: <dig> accumulated at 90 days after blooming. linoleic acid  decreased from  <dig> to  <dig> daf and then increased along with the maturity of fruit. however, other fatty acids such as linolenic acid , palmitic acid , and stearic acid  decreased throughout the fruit development . fresh fruits at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> daf, representing four different development stages, were selected for further transcriptomic analysis.

total rna were extracted from the fresh fruits at four different development stages of s. paniculata and used to construct four cdna libraries separately. the cdna libraries consisted of a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads with an average length of 548 bp. after the adaptor and low quality reads were removed, approximately  <dig> , <dig>  high quality clean reads were obtained. the average read size, q <dig> percentage , and gc percentage for each library was 537 bp,  <dig> , and  <dig> %, respectively . all clean reads were mutually aligned and assembled using trinity software . a total of  <dig>  contigs with a mean length of 680 bp was obtained. then a final contigs assembly produced  <dig>  non-redundant unigenes with an average length of 593 bp and n <dig> length of 785 bp . the length of unigenes’ sequences mainly ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  nt, and unigene number gradually decreased without obvious disjunction as the length of sequences increased. these results indicate that a good continuity and high quality of rna sequencing was conducted . of the unigenes,  <dig>   were short sequences between 200 nt and 300 nt, whereas only  <dig>   were longer than  <dig>  nt. these results indicated short sequences dominated the unigenes of s. paniculata. all high-quality reads were deposited in the national center for biotechnology information  short read archive  database under accession numbers prjna <dig>  currently, a complete genome of s. paniculata does not exist in such a public database. therefore, the transcriptome data set reported in this paper would enrich the database for future functional genes annotation, key enzyme identification, and genetic differentiation expression analysis.

functional annotation of non-redundant unigenes
based on the predicted sequences from a final contigs assembly, the  <dig>  unigenes were annotated using the blast program against nr, go, cog, kegg protein databases. a total of  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   unigenes had the most significant blast matches with known proteins in the nr, go, cogs, and kegg database, respectively. of the unigenes,  <dig>   had the best blast matches in at least one of the four databases, whereas  <dig>   had the best blast matches to proteins in all of the four databases . however, the remaining  <dig>   unigenes had no significant annotation hit, which may result from a large number of short sequences  generated in our study. the short sequences do not have a characterized protein domain and may cause the false-negative results  <cit> . similar results were seen in previous investigations on yellow horn species  <cit> .table  <dig> functional annotation of symplocos paniculata unigenes in public protein databases




the similarity analysis between s. paniculata unigenes and nr protein databases was conducted using blast matches . the percentage of putative proteins was  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> % at the four categories of low e-value . there were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> % putative proteins showing 40 ~ 60%, 60 ~ 68%, 80 ~ 100% of similarity, respectively, with the known proteins in nr protein database . these results ensured the accuracy and reliability of blast match analyses. s. paniculata unigenes had significant matches with homology genes from grape  , followed by theobroma cacao , black cottonwood  , potato  , jatropha , japanese apricot  , orange  , apple  , castorbean   and other species . in addition, there were  <dig>   unigenes that were not homology to any genes of any plant species .fig.  <dig> similarity analysis between symplocos paniculata unigenes and nr database. a e-value  distribution of top blast hits for each s. paniculata unigene, b similarity of s. paniculata putative proteins with known proteins in nr database , c top-hit species distribution for blast matches for s. paniculata unigenes




to understand specific functions of the putative unigenes, blast search was conducted in the go database. the go database is a collection of the controlled vocabularies describing the biology of a gene product in any organism  <cit> . the  <dig>  of the unigenes were assigned into three main go functional categories  and  <dig> sub-categories . the biological process category was assigned into  <dig> sub-categories. the most two abundant sub-categories were “metabolic process” and “cellular process”, which contained  <dig>  unigenes  and  <dig>  unigenes , respectively. the cellular component category was further classified into  <dig> sub-categories. the largest two sub-categories were “cell” and “cell part”, which contained  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes, respectively. the molecular function category had been mapped into  <dig> go terms with the majority unigenes in “catalytic activity”  and followed by “binding” . these results suggested that a large number of metabolic activities occurred during the growth and development of s. paniculata.fig.  <dig> go classification of the differentially expressed symplocos paniculata unigenes  at four different fruit development stages. the left and the right side of the panel show the percentage of genes and the number of genes that are classified in the three terms including biological process, cellular component, and molecular function




meanwhile, cog analysis was used to determine the functions of the predicted unigenes  <cit> . the  <dig>  unigenes were assigned into  <dig> function categories . the largest group is “general function prediction only” . this indicated that a large number of unknown genes in s. paniculata that were deposited in the public database have a great exploration potential. the second largest group is “posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones” , followed by “translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis” , “energy production and conversion”  and “signal transduction mechanisms” . however, the group of “cell motility” only contained  <dig> unigenes . of the unigenes, both the group of “carbohydrate transport and metabolism” and the group of “amino acid transport and metabolism” contained  <dig>   unigenes, whereas the group of “lipid transport and metabolism” had  <dig>   unigenes.fig.  <dig> cog classifications of symplocos paniculata unigenes




the previously annotated sequences for unigenes involved in kegg classifications have been searched to evaluate the completeness of transcriptome libraries and the effectiveness of the annotation processes  <cit> . the  <dig>  unigenes were annotated into five kegg categories ,  <dig> sub-categories, and  <dig> pathways . among the five main categories, “metabolism” had the largest number of unigenes , followed by “genetic information processing” , “organismal systems” , “cellular processes”  and “environmental information processing represented” . among the  <dig> sub-categories, “translation” was the maximum group with  <dig>  unigenes, followed by “carbohydrate metabolism” , and the smallest group containing only  <dig> unigenes was “signaling molecules and interaction”. of the  <dig> pathways, approximately  <dig>  unigenes were mapped to  <dig> lipid metabolic canonical pathways. among them, “fatty acid metabolism” had the highest unigenes number , followed by “glycerolipid metabolism” , “fatty acid biosynthesis” , “steroid biosynthesis” , “glycerophospholipid metabolism” , and “sphingolipid metabolism”  . “primary bile acid biosynthesis” contained only  <dig> unigenes. in addition, other pathways related to lipid metabolism were “fatty acid elongation” , “biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids” , and “alpha-linolenic acid metabolism” .fig.  <dig> functional classification and pathway assignment of unigenes of symplocos paniculata by kegg. the results are summarized in five main categories: a cellular process; b environmental information process; c genetic information process; d metabolism; e organismal systems

according to the kegg and kobas pathway assignment and functional annotation of the unigenes, the key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism pathways had been found and presented in table  <dig> and additional file 8: table s <dig>  a sketch map of the lipid metabolism processes of s. paniculata fruit was produced on the basis of these identified enzymes, including fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism, and glyceropholipid metabolism pathways .table  <dig> key enzymes related to fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism identified by annotation of the symplocos paniculata unigenes


fig.  <dig> the schematic diagram of the pathway and temporal expressional patterns of lipid metabolism. the enzymes identified from functional unigenes annotation were used to produce the schematic diagram. the icons close to each enzyme show the results of deseq analysis . the identified key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism include acetyl-coa carboxylase carboxyl transferase, ; malonyl-coa-acp transacylase, ; 3-ketoacyl acp synthase ii, ; 3-ketoacyl acp synthase iii, ; 3-ketoacyl acp reductase, ; 3r-hydroxymyristoyl acp dehydrase, ; enoyl-acpreductase i, ; fatty acyl-acp thioesterase a, ; fatty acyl-acp thioesterase b, ; acyl-acp desaturase, ; palmitoyl-coa hydrolase, ; long-chain acyl-coa synthetase, ; d12-desaturase, ; d15-desaturase, ; glycerol kinase, ; glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, ; lysophosphatidyl acyltransferase, ; phosphatidate phosphatase, ; diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase  <dig>  ; phospholipid: diacylglycerol acyltransferase  <dig>  ; lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase,  and phospholipase a <dig>  . lipid substrates are abbreviated: 16: <dig>  palmitic acid; 18: <dig>  stearic acid; 18: <dig>  oleic acid; 18: <dig>  linoleic acid and 18: <dig>  linolenic acid




the vital enzymes in the pathway of fatty acid biosynthesis were identified. firstly,  <dig> unigenes were identified to encode multi-subunit acetyl-coa carboxylase . acc is a rate-limiting enzyme to catalyze acetyl-coa to form malonyl-coa in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. secondly, only one unigene was found for coding the enzyme of malonyl-coa acp transacylase . mat catalyzes the malonyl-coa to the malonyl-acp, which is the primary substrate for a subsequent cycle of condensation reactions. in condensation reaction cycle, two carbon units of acyl chain were added to malonyl-acp with the help of several key enzymes for fatty acid synthesis. these enzymes were identified including 3-ketoacyl-acp synthase iii , 3-ketoacyl acp reductase , 3-hydroxyacyl-acp dehydratase , enoyl-acp reductase i , and 3-ketoactyl-acp synthase ii . this condensation reaction cycle was repeated six or seven times to add a total of  <dig> or  <dig> carbon units. through these processes, the acetyl-coa consecutively turns into palmitic acid-acp  or generates stearic acid-acp . along the pathway of fatty acid elongation, one unigene was found to encode fatty acyl-acp thioesterase a  that release 18:0/1-acp to 18:0/ <dig>  five unigenes to encode fatty acyl-acp thioesterase b  that prefer to remove acp from 16:0-acp to produce 16: <dig>  and four unigenes to encode pch  that release 18:2/3-acp to 18:2/ <dig>  meanwhile, in the pathway of fatty acid desaturation,  <dig> unigenes were identified to encode acyl-acp desaturase  that desaturates18:0-acp to 18:1-acp. a total of  <dig> unigenes were introduced to encode d <dig> -desaturase  that can desaturate 18:1-acp to 18:2-acp. five unigenes were encoded d <dig> -desaturase  that further desaturates 18:2-acp to form 18:3-acp. furthermore,  <dig> unigenes were encoded long chain acyl-coa synthetase  was involved in the fatty acid metabolism pathway , which was responsible for conversion of acyl-coas pool from free fatty acids. acetyl-coa generated provides an intermediate for the tag synthesis process by fatty acid catabolism.

in our study, no unigene was found to encode the 3-ketoactyl-acp synthase i , which shares a partial of functions with kas ii in fatty acid elongation pathways. kas could catalyze to extend the carbon chain from c <dig> to c <dig>  but is far less effective for 16:0-acp and almost inactive for 18:0-acp  <cit> . oleic acid  is a dominating component of the fruit oil of s. paniculata. our observations indicate that kas i is not an essential enzyme in s. paniculata, although it is very common in eukaryotes and bacteria  <cit> . similar results were seen in other woody oil plants  <cit> .

unigenes related to catabolism pathways for tags
acylglycerols act as an energy reserve in many organisms and are the major components of seed oil  <cit> . tag is the most common acylglycerol in seed oil. free fatty acids serve as the primary substrate for tag biosynthesis. all putative enzymes within the tag biosynthesis pathway based on the kegg pathway assignment were listed , and the tag pathway was shown in fig.  <dig>  a total of  <dig> unigenes were found to code glycerol kinase  that catalyzed glycerol to produce the glycerol-3-phosphate. the glycerol-3-phosphate was subsequently catalyzed to form lysophosphatidic acid with the help of 24-unigenes-coded glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase  . four kinds of acylglycero-3-phosphate acyltransferase  had been identified to lpaat <dig>  lpaat <dig>  lpaat <dig>  and lpaat <dig> with five, two, three, and one encoded unigenes respectively. they played a critical role in acylating the lyso-phosphatidic acid at the position sn- <dig> to synthesize phosphatidic acid  in the plastid, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the mitochondria of cells  <cit> . six unigenes were found to encode phosphatidate phosphatase  that can remove the phosphate group of the pa to generate diacylglycerols . at the last step of tag biosynthesis, six-unigene-encoded diacylglycerol acyltransferase  transferred an acyl group from acetyl-coa to sn- <dig> of dag to form tag. tags stored in spherical compartments in oil body form serve as energy sources for seed germination and seedling growth  <cit> . oil bodies are surmised to arise from the endoplasmic reticulum   <cit>  and are surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer and abundant amphipathic proteins such as oleosin, caleosin, and steroleosin . in our transcriptome libraries, six transcripts were found to code oleosin, two unigenes for caleosin, and one for steroleosin. alternatively, tag can transform from a phosphatidylcholine  with the aid of the phospholipid: diacylglycerol acyltransferase  , which uses phosphatidylcholine as the acyl donor to transfer an acyl group to the sn- <dig> position of dag to produce tag  <cit> . it is generally accepted that phosphatidylcholine  also can be used for polyunsaturated fatty acids synthesis, one unigene was identified to encode phospholipase a <dig>  that catalyzes pc to generate lysophosphatidylcholine. and four unigenes encodes lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase  that esterifies oleic acid  to form c18:1-pc, and then c18:1-pc was desaturated by fad <dig> to generate c18:2/3-pc.table  <dig> key enzymes related to tag biosynthesis and metabolism identified by annotation of the symplocos paniculata unigenes




in tag metabolism, 26-unigene-encoded triacylglycerol lipases  release tag to dag. it is worth mentioning that the dgat, pdat, and tagl are vital enzymes in the tag pathway that determine cellular oil content and quality. results in this study establish a nearly complete gene bank associated with oil accumulation of s.paniculata. expressed sequence tags  revealed could be considered candidate genes for future genetic cloning and modification.

gene expression profiles of oil accumulation
in order to fully understand the differentially expression patterns of the specific genes associated with fruit development and oil accumulation. by comparing rpkm value of unigenes between the different fruit oil accumulation phases of s. paniculata , a total of  <dig>  unigenes increased or decreased over 3-folds in rpkm value and were differentially expressed in our experiment . a hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted based on the rpkm value of these unigenes . all differentially expressed unigenes were clustered into three groups. unigenes in a single cluster have identical or similar expression patterns during fruit oil accumulation stages. group i consisted of  <dig>  degs that all represented up-regulated pattern. the mean log2rpkm value of the degs continues to increase with the fruit development. group ii contained  <dig>  degs that up-regulated from  <dig> to  <dig> daf and down-regulated thereafter. group iii included  <dig>  degs that were down-regulated . cluster results suggest that a relatively clear and coordinated expression pattern occurs during the fruit development period of s. paniculata.fig.  <dig> cluster analysis of the differentially expressed genes in symplocos paniculata. a comparative profiles of differentially expressed unigenes level during the four oil accumulation period, from top to bottom:  <dig> vs  <dig> daf,  <dig> vs  <dig> daf, and  <dig> vs  <dig> daf, a: log <dig> , m: log2; b dendrogram of hierarchical cluster analysis of the differentially expressed unigenes , the green highlights genes being highly expressed. the red highlights genes being low expressed. the color scale indicates unigenes expression values; c the three cluster group of different expressional patterns




the up and down regulated unigenes at different developmental stages were integrated  and mapped into the go  and kegg public databases . the distribution of up-regulated and down- regulated unigenes involved in lipid metabolism pathway was described in fig. 8b. a total of  <dig> unigenes were differentially expressed genes between  <dig> and  <dig> daf with more down-regulated unigenes  than up-regulated ones . between  <dig> and  <dig> daf,  <dig> unigenes were greatly expressed with more down-regulated unigenes  than up-regulated ones . however,  <dig> unigenes differentially expressed between  <dig> and  <dig> daf, and the number of up-regulated ungenes  was more than that of down-regulated unigenes . the results of a venn diagram analysis showed that  <dig>  unigenes were expressed in all four samples . there were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  unigenes expressed in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> daf, respectively. a comparative analysis of differentially expressed unigenes related to lipid metabolism in the four developmental stages identified  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes during the period of 10– <dig>  80– <dig>  and 140– <dig> daf . the expression pattern of differential regulatory unigenes might play an essential role in modulating the oil accumulation of s. paniculata.fig.  <dig> differentially expressed profiles of unigene among the different fruit developmental stages of symplocos paniculata. a distribution of up and down regulated unigenes in different development stages, b distribution of up and down regulated unigenes involved in lipid metabolism in different development stages, c distribution of unigenes in different fruit development stages, d distribution of differential expression unigenes involved in lipid metabolism




the up and down regulated unigenes involved in lipid metabolism were annotated . a strong temporal pattern in transcriptional profiles throughout oil synthesis was observed. during the period of  <dig> to  <dig> daf , enzymes including kar, fatb, sad, mfp <dig>  lpcat <dig> gpat <dig>  and pdat <dig> were up-regulated whereas the enzymes of acc, fad <dig>  fad <dig>  pla <dig>  and gpat <dig> involved in lipid metabolism were mostly down-regulated. these results indicate that genes related to fatty acids or tag metabolisms were relatively inactive which resulted in the slow oil accumulation. in contrast, carbohydrate metabolism is more active at the early fruit development phase. carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism share the same substrate of acetyl-coa, which is an important precursor for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis and elongation, tricarboxylic acid cycle , and other phytochemical biosynthesis in plant cells  <cit> .

during the period of  <dig> to  <dig> daf, the up-regulated unigenes associated with fas and tag biosynthesis pathways, such as mat, ear, kas ii, fata, fatb, fad <dig>  gpat <dig>  and dgat <dig> were highly expressed at this stage of fruit development. these also correspond with the increase of oil content in fruit . these candidate unigenes associated with oil accumulation pathways showed great potential for further genetic modification of oil content improvement. during the period of  <dig> to  <dig> daf, the up-regulated unigenes  were notably linked to fatty acid elongation and fatty acid desaturation pathways. this coincided with our investigation on dynamic patterns of oil content and fatty acid composition. for example, unsaturated fatty acid increased sharply with stable oil content between  <dig> to  <dig> daf. fad <dig> and fad <dig> played essential roles in the conversion of saturated fatty acid to unsaturated fatty acid.

it is well known that acyl-coas is transported from the cytosol to er for glycerolipid synthesis through diffusion via soluble carriers or more efficient inter-membrane transporters  <cit> . acc is a key enzyme in the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. overexpression of acc alters the fatty acid composition of seed oil and increases the fatty acid content, which leads to an increased oleic acid content  <cit> . in our study, an extremely low expression of acc was observed. the expression of acc was down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> daf and up-regulated at  <dig> daf . similar results were seen in siberian apricot   <cit>  and tung oil tree   <cit> . a low expression of acc genes at  <dig> and  <dig> daf might be related to the remarkable accumulation of fatty acids in this development stage  . this agrees with previous reports that adding oleic acid  to the cell suspension culture of canola  could inhibit plastidial acc activity and cause a reduction of fatty acid synthesis  <cit> . modifying the acc to improve lipid production was attended, but not effective  <cit> . therefore, further research should be conducted to better understand acc transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that contribute to the oil synthesis.

fata/b thioesterases make a remarkable contribution for free fatty acids synthesis that releases the fatty acids from the acyl carrier protein . fatb is more effective for removing acp from 16:0-acp to produce 16: <dig>  while fata prefer to hydrolyze 18:0-acp or 18:1-acp to release acp to generate stearic acid  and oleic acid   <cit> . in this study, fata genes showed a stable expression between  <dig> to  <dig> daf and sharply up-regulated between  <dig> to  <dig> daf  and  <dig> to  <dig> daf. this coincides with the rapid increase in oleic acid  . however, the fatb genes notably up-regulated throughout fruit development that resulted in a higher proportion formation of palmitic acid  over stearic acid  and oleic acid  during the period of  <dig> to  <dig> daf . gene manipulation of fata/b could be done to adjust the relative proportion of fatty acids.

two types of enzymes participate in fatty acid desaturation in s. paniculata. one type includes aad and sad that catalyze saturated fatty acid in plastids  to form monounsaturated fatty acids. the other type is located on the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and chloroplast and introduces double-unsaturated bonds at specific positions. for example, fad <dig> and fad <dig> catalyze unsaturated c18:1-acp to c18:2-acp. fad <dig> further desaturates c18:2-acp to form c18:3-acp  <cit> . in our study, sad genes were up-regulated over five folds during the period of  <dig> to  <dig> daf when a concomitant sharp rising of oleic acid  occurred. fad <dig> genes were down-regulated during the period of  <dig> to  <dig> daf, but dramatically up-regulated over six folds during the period of  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> daf. this pattern corresponds to the trend of linoleic acid . fad <dig> genes were down regulated throughout fruit development with a stable expression of aad and fad <dig> . fatty acid composition of oil plants were genetically modified using the hairpin rna-mediated gene silencing technique to down-regulate the expression of the key fatty acid desaturase genes in seeds  <cit> . in comparison with untransformed plants , the inhibition of the expression of sad genes resulted in a 38% increase of stearic acid in both canola  <cit>  and cotton   <cit>  seed oils. oleic acid  content was also increased through silencing fad <dig> by  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> and 62%, respectively, in canola and mustard greens   <cit> , soybean   <cit> , and cotton seeds  <cit> . in addition, palmitic acid decreased after genetic modification  <cit> . it is important to note that the relative proportion of fatty acids is the critical factor that impacts bio-diesel production and edible oil quality. the oil rich in monounsaturated fatty acids instead of saturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid  is ideal for bio-diesel production. high content of unsaturated fatty acids would contribute to the instability of bio-diesel fuel  <cit> . however, unsaturated fatty acids in edible oil, especially the oleic acid, play a significant role in human health  <cit> . s. paniculata oil has high percentages of oleic and linoleic acids. sad, fad <dig>  and fad <dig> are potential targets for modifying oil composition to meet the needs of either edible oil production or bioenergy applications.

pdat <dig> and dgat <dig> were two confirmed genes that are essential for tag biosynthesis. in previous studies, silencing of pdat <dig> or dgat <dig> would result in  <dig> to 80% decreases in oil content  <cit> . in our study, dgat1genes were up-regulated during the period of  <dig> to  <dig> daf, whereas pdat <dig> up-regulated expression between  <dig> and  <dig> daf . these results suggest that dgat <dig> might be the major enzyme in the last step of tag biosynthesis in s. paniculata. moreover, ectopic expression of dgat <dig> was confirmed to improve the oil content in seeds of arabidopsis  <cit> , maize   <cit> , and soybean  <cit> . overexpression of dgat <dig> would improve oil accumulation. similarly, pdat <dig> may provide a way to produce fatty acids from acetyl-coa in tag biosynthesis. in addition, tagl is a key enzyme related to tag metabolism that showed a down-regulation during the period of  <dig> to <dig> daf and up- regulation between  <dig> and  <dig> daf . tagl metabolized tag to dag and thus, lead to oil content reduction. these suggest the inhibition of tagl genes would decrease tag metabolism to increase lipid storage.

gpat is a key enzyme that plays a critical role in the first step of biosynthesis of membrane phospholipids and storage tag in nearly all plants  <cit> . gpat catalyzes glycerol-3-phosphate to generate lysophosphatidic acid. lpaat then catalyzes the subsequent acylation of lysophosphatidic acid at the sn- <dig> position to produce phosphatidic acid. phosphatidic acid is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of both membrane polar lipid and neutral storage lipid  <cit> . in previous studies on the gpat family in arabidopsis, gpat <dig> and gpat4- <dig> with sn- <dig> region specificity were non-essential for tag synthesis, whereas gpat <dig> was the er-localized gpat enzyme responsible for plant membrane lipid and oil biosynthesis  <cit> . in addition, the function of gpat2- <dig> still remains unclear  <cit> . genetic modification of gpat and lpaat in the tag assembly has been demonstrated to enhance seed oil content  <cit> . for example, overexpression of a plastidial safflower gpat and an escherichia coli gpat in arabidopsis can increase the seed oil content to  <dig> and 15%, respectively  <cit> . a notable increase of  <dig> and 48% in seed oil content were observed by overexpression of a mutant form of yeast lpaat in arabidopsis and canola  <cit> . overexpression of the rapeseed microsomal lpaat isozymic gene could result in a 13% increase in oil content of arabidopsis seeds  <cit> . results indicate that increasing the expression of lpaat in seeds might lead to a greater flux of intermediates through the kennedy pathway  <cit>  and result in tag accumulation. in our study, gpat <dig>  gpat <dig>  gpat <dig>  gpat <dig>  and gpat <dig> showed different expression patterns at fruit development stages indicating that they function differently . gpat <dig> is up-regulated between  <dig> and  <dig> daf that coincide with rapid oil increase . but the lpaat genes family did not show any significant expression . therefore, improving gpat <dig> production would contribute to the oil synthesis of s. paniculata.

experimental validation and analysis of key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism
the relative expression level and temporal transcription patterns of the key genes associated with oil accumulation were analyzed  <cit>  to assess the accuracy of the sequencing and target of s. paniculata transcriptome. six vital enzymes including acc, fata, fatb, fad <dig>  dgat <dig>  and padt <dig> were selected to design primers for qrt-pcr validation . the ΔΔct values of these selected genes were mostly consistent with sequencing results . there were significant correlations between rpkm with ΔΔct with correlation coefficient of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for acc, fata, fatb, fad <dig>  dgat <dig>  and padt <dig>  respectively . these results indicate that the unigenes assembly results were reliable and it is feasible to use the deseq method to investigate subsequent differential expression analysis. the expression level of most of the selected genes was higher in the qrt-pcr validation experiment than in the sequencing analysis with the exception of acc, fata, and fatb at  <dig> daf and padt <dig> at  <dig> daf. the extremely low expression level of acc at  <dig> daf made it difficult to detect. a different expression pattern of fatb was observed between qrt-pcr analysis and deseq result. fad <dig> genes exhibited higher expression in the qrt-pcr validation experiment at  <dig> daf. such inconsistency in the expression level of fatb and fad <dig> genes could be due to primers’ specificity and qrt-pcr reaction conditions during the experimental validation analysis  <cit> .fig.  <dig> quantitative rt-pcr validations of the six candidate lipid-related genes of symplocos paniculata. the comparative rpkm ratio and ΔΔct at  <dig> daf are used as a control for normalization. results represent the mean  of three biological replicates. error bars represent the standard error of three biological replicates




CONCLUSIONS
