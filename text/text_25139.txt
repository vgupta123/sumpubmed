BACKGROUND
directional cell motility plays an essential role in many biological processes, such as tissue formation/regeneration, wound healing, or tumor metastasis, and can be induced by both endogenously occurring and externally applied electric fields . persistent directionality requires precise, dynamic and regularly repeated cycles of interactions between cytoskeleton proteins, cell membranes, and the extracellular matrix so as to promote de novo protrusions at the leading edge of migrating cells, which distinguishes this process from random cell movement  <cit> . focal adhesion complexes at the cell membrane-matrix interface allow for forward cell locomotion through rapid protein turnover, which results in a dynamic connection/disconnection to the matrix as cells move in a preferred direction. thus, proteins that are preferentially located at these sites during directional movement may play a significant role in direction sensing. previous works, which have investigated different cell types, have observed that many proteins, lipids, and organelles redistribute because cells are polarized during electrotaxis  <cit> ; however, the molecules and mechanisms that enable cells to perceive direction during electrotactic, persistent motility have yet to be investigated.

apart from the many studies that have investigated the cytoskeleton proteins that modulate cellular migration machinery, recent studies have focused on membrane ion transporters and their interactions with cytoskeleton proteins  <cit> , specifically in their potential roles in cell motility. the emerging roles of membrane ion transport proteins in the control of electrotaxis and in directionally persistent cell migration have first been reported for the voltage-gated na+ channel in rat prostate cancer cells  <cit> , followed by other studies concerning pkd <dig> cation channels in directional sperm movement  <cit> , aquaporins in astroglial cell migration  <cit> , potassium channels in the invasiveness of embryonic stem cells  <cit> , trp channels in embryonic lung fibroblast motility  <cit> , and a recent report from our own work concerning voltage-gated calcium channels in the electrotaxis of osteoblast cells  <cit> .

aside from ion translocation, several recent studies have reported on the roles of both nhe and naka in cytoskeletal remodeling, cell polarity, and lamellipodia formation  <cit> . when taken together, especially in regard to their primary functions as ph or cell volume regulators and cellular migration-specific membrane potential state modulators, nhe and naka can provide new insights into the understanding of both the physiological and the mechanical regulation of directional sensing in cells.

herein, we suggest that naka and nhe <dig> can act as directional sensors in ef-induced directional cell motility via a mechanism that involves pip <dig> as a potential mediator and the cell membrane potential  as a regulatory cue. using saos- <dig> and calvarial osteoblasts, which represent anode- and cathode- directed motility, respectively, we show that 1) active nhe <dig> is concentrated in membrane protrusions that are accompanied by proton fluxes  at the leading edge of the cellular migration, especially in cathode-directed cells, and its activity is required for the perception of direction; 2) nhe <dig> is homogenously localized throughout the surface membrane and is involved in directional migration; 3) vmem, as a result of naka activity, has a regulatory function that maintains the persistent directionality by modulating the spatiotemporal changes between the leading edge  and the rear end  in directionally migrating cells.

RESULTS
nhe <dig> and naka colocalize with ß-actin and vinculin on the leading-edge of the cell
phosphorylated nhe <dig>  was observed to specifically accumulate at the membrane protrusions of polarized  and non-polarized  cells. interestingly, pnhe <dig> only appeared at the same places where ß-actin accumulates, which represents significant colocalization at cell leading-protrusions in both anode - and cathode -directed cells . the colocalization rate of pnhe3/ß-actin was observed to increase by  <dig> % and by  <dig> %in cathode- and anode- directed cells, respectively, during electrotaxis . the total nhe <dig> was evenly distributed on the cell membrane with less significant accumulations in the protrusions . nhe <dig> exhibited a homogenous distribution throughout the cell membrane, regardless of cell polarization or migration direction .

unlike nhe <dig>  the total naka was observed to specifically accumulate at the membrane protrusions of polarized and non-polarized cells. the pattern of accumulated naka, which was especially striking in calvaria cells, resembled that of the focal adhesion marker protein, vinculin, which directed us to further investigate whether naka and vinculin are colocalized in cell membrane protrusions. indeed, significant colocalizations of naka with vinculin were observed at the cell periphery of non-polarized cells and at the leading edge of polarized cells during both cathodal  and anodal  cell motility. additionally, naka was localized also at the cell nuclei . very slight decreases of  <dig> % and  <dig> % in cathode- and anode-directed cells, respectively, in the colocalization rate of naka/vinculin were observed during electrotaxis . phosphorylated naka was homogenously distributed on the cell membrane during directed motility .

ef induces the relocation of proteins to the cell leading-protrusions
in order to define the degree of protein relocation to the leading edge during directed cell movement, we plotted the distribution of each protein as a ratio of the mean fluorescence intensity in protrusions to that of the cytoplasm in polarized and in non-polarized cells. the fluorescence intensity ratios for the total naka, vinculin, and ß-actin were greater in polarized cells than in non-polarized cells, which reveal that these proteins were relocated from the cytoplasm to the membrane protrusions during directional cell movement. in both cathode- and anode-directed cells, relocation rates of naka from cytoplasm to cell leading edge were enhanced by 83% and 127%, respectively, during electrotaxis. in cathode-directed cells, relocation rate of vinculin and ß-actin to the leading edge of the cell was enhanced by  <dig> and 400%, respectively, whereas in anode-directed cells, vinculin and ß-actin were relocated by only 82% and 19%, respectively; however, the relocation of pnhe <dig> to the leading edge was enhanced by 400% in cathode -directed cells, whereas it was diminished by 41% in anode -directed cells . pip <dig> was observed to be located along the cell periphery during both cathodal and anodal movement; however, it was also located along the cell periphery in randomly migrating cells .

cellular directedness is regulated by the activity of nhe <dig>  nhe <dig> and naka
ef-induced cellular directedness was attenuated when nhe <dig>  nhe <dig>  or naka activity was suppressed via the use of the specific inhibitors, s <dig>  hoe  <dig> or oubain, respectively, in both cathode- and anhode-directed movement. cells that were treated with the fak inhibitor, pf <dig>  were used as a positive control. although the cells exhibited an elongated shape in the applied ef as normal, they failed to form a polarized shape, which is characterized by a well-defined leading edge and rear end, when nhe <dig>  nhe <dig>  or naka was inhibited .

the inhibition of nhe <dig>  nhe <dig>  or naka slightly affected  the net displacement of both cathode- or anode- directed cells. in contrast, especially in anode-directed cells, inhibition dramatically affected the cellular speed. saos- <dig> cells exhibited a 300% increased speed when nhe <dig> was inhibited  and a 500% increased speed when nhe <dig> was inhibited . in cathode-directed cells, the pharmacological inhibition of nhe <dig> and nhe <dig> resulted in an average increase of only  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the inhibition of naka divergently affected the cellular speed in cathode- and in anode- directed cells. the cellular speed was increased by 67%  in cathode- and decreased by 71%  in anode-directed cells when naka was inhibited. the inhibition of fak, which served as a positive control in this study, caused a 500%  increase in cellular speed in anode-directed cells, whereas the speed of cathode-directed cells increased only by 48%  .

the intracellular levels of pnhe <dig> which are associated with pip <dig>  are divergently regulated depending on the perceived direction during electrotaxis
the intracellular levels of both total and phosphorylated nhe <dig> decreased by 7%, which was also associated with a 21% decrease in pip <dig> levels, in cathodally migrating cells . in contrast, the total and phosphorylated naka levels were elevated by 17% and by 12%, respectively, in cathode-directed cells. the nhe <dig> level was not affected during cathodal electrotaxis . in anodally migrating cells , the intracellular level of phosphorylated nhe <dig> increased by 29% whereas the total nhe <dig> level was not affected. furthermore, the pip <dig> level in anode-directed cells was also increased by 7%. similar to what was observed for naka levels in cathode-directed cells, phosphorylated naka levels also increased by 23% in anode-directed cells, but without a change to the total naka levels. the nhe <dig> level decreased by 7% during anodal electrotaxis .

the cell membrane is relatively hyperpolarized at the leading edge versus the rear end during directed migration
regardless of migration direction, different membrane potential at two ends of the cell was observed, that is, in both cathode- and anode-directed cells; the cell membrane exhibited a relatively hyperpolarized state on the leading edge in comparison to the rear end during electrotaxis. taking advantage of the vmem reporter dye, dibac <dig>  which is taken up by cells through the depolarized membrane, we monitored the spatiotemporal differences between the front and back ends of polarized cells during electrotaxis. in both cathode- and anode-directed cells, we observed that dibac <dig> was taken up first from the rear end, whereas there was no specific direction of dye uptake in randomly migrating control cells . vmem kinetics collected from the selected region of interests  during the time-lapse recording of the cells loaded with dibac <dig> confirms that the leading edge of the cells has lower fluorescence intensity profiles  than the rear end . however, it is also important to notice that the limitations of the technique such as fluorescence signal relevant to the morphological differences should be kept in mind when using potentiometric-, single excitation dyes.

all taken together, this observation reveals that the cell membrane had a relatively depolarized state at the rear end versus the leading edge or similarly, a relatively hyperpolarized state at the leading edge versus the rear end .

phi is elevated in the membrane protrusions at the leading-edge of cathode-directed cells but not in anode-directed cells
cathodally migrating cells, which have a well-defined polarized and elongated morphology, were observed to have bubble-shaped outward proton fluxes that are specifically located at the termini of membrane protrusions on their leading edge during electrotaxis. false colored  images shown in figure 6b represent the spatiotemporal differences in the bcecf-am intensity profile, indicating the changes in phi. these sites were likely to be the same regions where pnhe <dig> had specifically accumulated on the leading edge . randomly migrating control cells  also exhibited ph bubbles, but they were located non-specifically along the cell periphery. conversely, there was either one or no bubble per cell in anode-directed cells  and in their controls  during electrotaxis.

discussion
this study demonstrates that naka, nhe <dig>  and nhe <dig> are involved in cellular directedness during electrotaxis, which imply that vmem is a spatiotemporal regulator between the leading edge and rear end. we suggest that nhe <dig> might be a cathode-specific sensor protein because there was an increased relocation of active nhe <dig> to the membrane protrusions, which was accompanied by an elevated phi at those same sites that specifically occurred in cathode-directed cells, not in anode-directed ones, during electrotaxis. however, intracellular levels of active nhe <dig> and of pip <dig> were increased in anode-directed cells while they were less in cathode-directed cells in comparison to randomly migrating control cells. this can result from the localized activity of nhe <dig> in the membrane protrusions of cathode-directed cells. most of the data concerning nhe <dig> deal with its renal functions; however, few studies have demonstrated the interactions between nhe <dig> and cytoskeletal proteins and the related signaling pathways regarding cell motility. the actin-modifying agents cytochalasin and latrunculin have been found to inhibit epithelial nhe <dig> activity, whereas the housekeeping exchanger, nhe <dig>  has been found to be virtually affected  <cit> . similarly, the cytoskeletal scaffolding protein ezrin has been shown to regulate nhe <dig> translocation in caco- <dig> cells  <cit> . consistent with these studies, we demonstrate significant colocalizations of active nhe <dig> with the filopodia marker protein ß-actin on the leading-edge of both anode- and cathode-directed cells. the distinct patchy pattern of nhe <dig> may depend on the activity of nhe <dig> because only active nhe <dig> shows this pattern and, this activity seems to be specialized in the filopodia where ß-actin is present. this might be due to the close interaction of these two proteins during cell migration. additionally, the quenched directedness in the presence of the nhe3-specific inhibitor s <dig> supports the idea that nhe <dig> is involved in directional determination during electrotaxis. moreover, we have shown both a physiological and mechanistic role for nhe <dig> in cellular motility and directedness via demonstrating the colocalization of active nhe <dig> outward proton fluxes accompanied ß-actin  at the leading edge of directionally migrating cells.

in contrast to nhe <dig>  neither the expression nor the distribution of nhe <dig> was affected in directionally migrating cells during electrotaxis. although the pharmacological inhibition of nhe <dig> via the use of hoe  <dig> prevented the cells from perceiving their direction which they normally would during electrotaxis, this phenomenon might be due to one of its other crucial functions as a housekeeping protein, e.g. the regulation of intracellular ph and volume, or to its roles in cell migration  <cit> . therefore, we conclude that nhe <dig> is not specifically involved in determining the direction of migration, but instead, maintains the overall phi, volume, and osmotic balance, which is crucial to cellular physiology during directed cell motility.

the relatively hyperpolarized cell membrane on the leading edge versus the rear end of the cells, regardless of their direction, can be explained by the relocation of naka from the cytoplasm to the leading edge in both cathode- and anode-directed cells during electrotaxis. naka is a major regulator of vmem and maintains the resting membrane potential by transporting two k+ ions in and three na+ ions out of the cell. if the cell membrane is hyperpolarized on the leading edge, more naka needs to be recruited to those sites in order to reduce the excessive positive charges on the membrane and to bring vmem level down to its resting potential. naka has already been shown to be exponentially activated as a function of the vmem, which in turn leads to a hyperpolarized cell membrane  <cit> . independent of its role in ion transport, evidence exists for the involvement of naka in pi3k signaling and cell motility  <cit> , in epithelial polarization and the suppression of invasion  <cit> , and for its interaction with actin  <cit> . moreover, vmem itself has already been shown to induce cytoskeletal modifications in f-actin, microtubules, and vinculin  <cit>  and, in adherens junctions  <cit>  in endothelial cells. our study demonstrates that naka colocalizes with the focal adhesion marker protein vinculin at the leading edge of both anode- and cathode-directed cells, and its inhibition by oubain quenches cellular directedness. this suggests that naka is involved in focal adhesion turnover, and, hence, the inhibition of its activity interferes with directional cell motility. moreover, considering that the cell membrane is only hyperpolarized on the front and depolarized only on the back, regardless of the migration direction, vmem seems to maintain the persistent directedness rather than to perceive the direction by regulating the spatiotemporal naka mobility between the leading edge and the rear end of cells during directional cell motility. additionally, both the total and phosphorylated naka levels were increased in cathode-directed  cells, which indicate that both the expression and the activity of the protein were elevated in those cells during electrotaxis. in contrast, in anode-directed  cells, only the activity of the protein was increased, whereas the total level of the protein was not affected. these data indicate that naka activity is required in both anode- and cathode-directed cells.

cellular speed was dramatically increased, especially in anode-directed cells, when nhe <dig>  or nhe <dig>  as well as fak  activity was inhibited. this suggests a motility suppressor role for both nhe <dig> and nhe <dig> in these cells during directional motility. an nhe inhibition-induced reduction in cell adhesion and motility has been reported in various cell types  <cit> . these studies state that the local extracellular ph levels at focal adhesion sites modulate the strength of the cell adhesion and thereby migration of the cells on a collagen i matrices. an increase in nhe <dig> activity  was also observed to result in tighter adhesion and decreased cell migration, whereas a lack of protons, due to low nhe <dig> activity, prevented adhesion and migration. further studies should elucidate the exact mechanisms of interaction between nhe <dig> activity  and filopodia formation so as to understand its physio-mechanical roles in persistent, directional cell motility.

in contrast to nhe <dig> and nhe <dig>  the pharmacological inhibition of naka using oubain divergently decreased and increased the speed of anode- and of cathode-directed cells by 71% and an increase by 67%, respectively. it has already been reported that independent of its role in ion transport, naka has various other functions in cells  <cit> , including its role as a motility suppressor function in mdck carcinoma cells  <cit> ; however, the reason why naka activity divergently affects anode- and cathode-directed cells divergently in terms of cellular speed remains unknown and requires further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
our study shows that nhe <dig>  nhe <dig>  and naka, in combination with spatiotemporal changes in vmem between the leading edge and the rear end, are required for the determination of cellular directedness during electrotaxis. moreover, among these, nhe <dig> has unique responses that preferentially occur in cathode-directed cells, which suggests that it is a promising candidate for cathode-specific directional sensing . however, our interpretation would merit further testing, using vmem measurements through different tools to overcome the limitations of the technique used in this study. these data can be useful for further studies in which cell guidance is an important factor.
