BACKGROUND
microarray-based gene expression analysis is a major component of functional genomics research. using this approach, researchers can investigate the level of expression of all genes in a tissue or cell type in a single experiment  <cit> . several questions and concerns about the reliability, reproducibility and quality of microarray data have been raised  <cit>  and despite important recent advances in the evaluation of the existing technologies, some questions remain unanswered  <cit>  and the scientist is often lacking arguments to decide on which approach is best suited for his purpose.

the recently published microarray quality control  reports  <cit>  provide rich information regarding intra- and inter-platforms reliability. the primary goal of the maqc project was to evaluate the technical variability of dna microarray results obtained with a number of different microarray technologies. the maqc results showed relatively low technical variability in the intra-site and inter-site measurements, and high inter-platforms concordance for the thousands of genes identified as differentially expressed between  <dig> reference rna samples explored under  <dig> titration conditions  <cit> . the project was focused on technical variability and was not trying to answer a biological question  <cit> . the present study was designed to evaluate the ability of  <dig> commonly utilized microarray technologies to answer a relevant biological question, namely the change in gene expression between resting monocytes and macrophages derived from these monocytes. m-csf induced activation of monocytes for  <dig> days leads to differential regulation of a large number of genes, and offers the possibility to compare the microarray platforms across a wide range of differential gene expressions.

lists of differentially expressed genes  between monocytes and macrophages were established according to various criteria and compared to a reference list derived from a large number of experiments using a third technology. reproducibility and between platforms comparability was assessed on the whole content of each array and on a subset of well-matched transcripts common to the three investigated platforms. the biological relevance of the deg lists was assessed by testing their enrichment in gene ontology   <cit>  classes.

RESULTS
within and between platform consistency of expression data
for each platform, reproducibility of absolute and relative gene expression intensities between pairs of biological replicates within each sample type were examined on the subset of transcripts common to the three platforms. in monocyte samples, the inter-replicates correlation coefficients of absolute intensities ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for affymetrix, and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for illumina. in macrophages the respective ranges were  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig> . the correlations of relative expression  between pairs of replicates ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for affymetrix arrays and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for illumina arrays. typical plots of relative expression intensities for a pair of samples are shown in figure  <dig>  these results suggest that both platforms deliver highly replicable signals. additional file  <dig> shows the correlations coefficients of absolute and relative expression intensities between all pairs of replicates.

comparison of detection calls
for the subset of  <dig>  transcripts  common to the  <dig> compared platforms and the reference, the number of probes detected on each platform for each sample type is shown in additional file  <dig> . concordance of detection calls between affymetrix and illumina was > 70%. fifty eight affymetrix probe sets called present in the  <dig> samples were not detected on the illumina array  and  <dig> illumina probes detected with a score =  <dig> were called "absent" on the affymetrix platform .

intra-platform reproducibility of replicate probes
intra-platform reproducibility was also assessed by examining the expression levels of probes representing the same genes. discordances were observed on the  <dig> platforms, the signal delivered by multiple probes tagging the same gene being uncorrelated and/or showing differences in expression levels in opposite direction. examples of such discrepancies are available online .

differential expression analysis performed using all probes represented on each platform
the number of probes included in this analysis for each platform is provided online . for a p-value corrected for multiple testing, pc <  <dig> , the analysis of affymetrix data identified  <dig> probe sets, corresponding to  <dig> distinct genes differentially expressed between monocytes and macrophages. for the same level of statistical significance, the analysis of illumina data identified  <dig> differentially expressed probes, corresponding to  <dig> unique genes. the reference list established using the rng/mrc data with a pc <  <dig>  threshold included  <dig> genes .

the 'volcano plots' in figure  <dig> provide a simultaneous representation of log <dig> fold change and statistical significance  for the gene expression data obtained on the  <dig> compared and the reference platforms. for similar high log-odds the corresponding fold changes is smaller for data generated on the illumina  than on the affymetrix platform .

analysis based on a subset of well-matched transcripts common to the  <dig> platforms
the differential expression analysis was repeated using the subset of transcripts that were well matched across platforms . table  <dig> provides the number of genes identified as differentially expressed on each platform using three different selection criteria:  <dig>  a pc <  <dig> ,  <dig>  a pc <  <dig>  combined with a fold change >  <dig>  and  <dig>  the best- <dig> probes identified on each platform .

based on the subset of well-matched transcripts and using the pc <  <dig>  criterion, the affymetrix microarray identified  <dig> genes  and the illumina microarray identified  <dig> genes  while the reference list comprised  <dig> genes corresponding to  <dig> probes. the estimated fdr was < 1% on the three platforms . the list of these genes and their associated statistics is provided as additional data .

overlap in gene lists
the overlap among gene lists for the criteria used in table  <dig> is reported in figure  <dig>  the affymetrix and illumina microarrays identified in common  <dig> deg, representing respectively ~68% and ~64% of all genes identified on each platform. eighty seven percent and 89% of the genes in the affymetrix and illumina deg lists respectively were also present in the reference list. when the lists were defined by a combination of a pc <  <dig>  and a fold change >  <dig>  the number of genes identified in common by the three microarray platforms decreased to  <dig>  the number of genes was still large in the affymetrix list but was considerably reduced in the illumina and reference lists. the analysis carried out using all probes represented on each platform yielded similar conclusion . the subset of "best-3800" probes was established using the following procedure.  <dig>  for each platform, the list of probes whose expression differed between monocytes and macrophages at a pc <  <dig>  was ranked by decreasing fold change.  <dig>  for a given size of the list, the lists were compared and the number of overlapping genes  was plotted against the pre-specified size of the list . as illustrated on the figure  <dig> the number of overlapping genes increased with the size of the list and reached a plateau when the ~ <dig> top-ranked probes were selected in each list. using the "best-3800" probes,  <dig> distinct genes were co-present on the  <dig> types of arrays . the correlation of fold changes between the ranked deg lists was >  <dig>  for the  <dig> genes co-present on the affymetrix and illumina lists, >  <dig>  for the  <dig> genes co-present on the affymetrix and rng lists, and >  <dig>  for the  <dig> genes co-present on the illumina and rng lists. in addition, as the direction of change of expression of genes present by chance in the lists should frequently be discordant, the number of genes exhibiting discordant change for each pair of list was examined. as shown in figure  <dig>  discordant changes  were relatively few, representing  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the affymetrix-illumina, affymetrix-reference and illumina-reference list pairs, respectively.

gene ontology  comparison
additional table  <dig> online  shows, for each platform and using two gene list selection criteria, all go categories over-represented  in at least one of the three lists. using the lists of "best-3800" probes, sixteen go biological processes were significantly enriched in at least one list; ten,  <dig> and  <dig> of these processes were enriched in the affymetrix, illumina and rng- <dig> lists, respectively. the results of the go analysis are summarized in table  <dig> for the most relevant go categories. for each gene list, the number of genes belonging to a particular go category and the corresponding adjusted p-value are provided. for example, the "immunity and defense" biological process category comprises  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes among the  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes represented on the affymetrix, illumina, and rng arrays, respectively; these genes are highly over-represented in the "best-3800" reference list  in which  <dig> out of  <dig>  genes are mapped to this class . this over-representation is also observed for the illumina and affymetrix deg lists which identified respectively  <dig> and  <dig> genes known to play a role in the "immunity and defense" biological process. using the pc <  <dig>  criterion , the smaller number of genes within the deg lists derived from the affymetrix and illumina platforms was reflected by a smaller number of genes present within relevant go categories.

go biological process categories over represented in the lists of differentially expressed genes generated on each platform and according to two different selection criteria . the table is ordered by the adjusted p-value of the test of association between rng- <dig> list and go categories. for each platform, list of deg was compared to the list of all genes represented on the array. genes belonging to several go classes are included several times, once for each go class that is associated with this gene.

when the comparison of the two platforms was focused on a common set of genes represented on the  <dig> array types, the illumina list tended to include a larger number of genes belonging to the relevant go categories than the affymetrix list. this observation was made for both criteria used to define gene lists. conversely, the results of the go analysis based on the whole content of each platform revealed that the affymetrix platform identified a larger number of genes within go categories over-represented in the reference list .

given the high similarities between the affymetrix and illumina platforms in term of number of genes identified and p-values it was important to check whether these similarities reflected the identification of the same genes by both platforms. table  <dig> reports the number of overlapping genes in the "best-3800" deg lists according to go categories. the last column in the table shows, for each go category, the number of genes present in at least one of the lists. for example, within the "immunity and defense category",  <dig> genes were present in at least one of the lists; among them,  <dig>  were present in the  <dig> deg lists. the good performance of the  <dig> compared platforms relative to the reference is striking. in term of complementarity of platforms, if the genes identified by only one platform are excluded to limit the number of false positives, columns  <dig> and  <dig> provide the numbers of genes not identified by the illumina and affymetrix platforms respectively. these numbers are relatively small suggesting that in the context of this study, each of the  <dig> compared platforms provide rather complete information that is little complemented by the other platform.

discussion
monocytes and macrophages are important players in the immediate response to foreign agents and in the development of the adaptive immune response  <cit> . circulating monocytes are derived from specific myeloid progenitor cells and under particular conditions they may enter the arterial wall and mature into macrophages. macrophages are involved in the initial process of atherosclerotic plaques formation, and they are also involved in the inflammatory events that trigger the rupture of atherosclerotic plaques and clinical events  <cit> . investigating the biology of human blood monocytes, a relatively easily accessible cell, and macrophages is therefore of crucial interest for atherosclerosis research. the domain has been profoundly transformed by the recent availability of expression microarrays and we may be at the beginning of a new era in clinical and epidemiological research in which this technology will be used to investigate gene expression in circulating cells to predict occurrence, severity or evolution of disease as well as responses to treatment. assessing the reproducibility and biological relevance of available microarray technologies is therefore of major importance.

the illumina and affymetrix microarray technologies differ in many aspects. while affymetrix arrays use a set of different 25-mer probes synthesized in situ  <cit>  to characterize gene expression, illumina arrays utilize multiple copies of a single 50-mer probe attached to micro beads to quantify targets levels  <cit> . in addition, affymetrix probes are located at pre-specified locations on the array while on the illumina array, ~ <dig> beads for each probe are randomly distributed on the array and decoded using specific tagging sequences. these and other technical differences may lead to different results; data are therefore needed to comparatively assess the technologies. fortunately, recent large scale studies have provided a wealth of data generated by a number of array technologies including those investigated in the present study. according to the results of the maqc project the affymetrix and illumina arrays provide highly reproducible results  that correlate well with single gene expression measurements obtained by rt-pcr and taqman assays . former comparisons of the affymetrix and illumina technologies also based on a dilution study design led to the conclusion that both arrays deliver highly correlated results, especially for relatively high expression levels  <cit> .

questions remain however regarding the biological relevance of the gene expression measurements and differential patterns of expression delivered by both approaches and their possible complementarity. in this paper we focused on the relative abilities of affymetrix and illumina microarrays to characterize the change in gene expression that parallels the maturation of human blood monocytes into macrophages. to allow this comparison, a reference panel of differentially expressed genes was identified using a large number of samples hybridized to a third type of microarray  can have a profound influence on the degree of agreement in gene lists among the platforms. for the data generated on the rng/mrc platform we investigated several background correction and within/between array normalization methods implemented in the limma and marray packages. we found that the use of different normalization and background adjustment methods can have a profound influence on the number of genes found to be differentially expressed on this platform . to limit this problem, we applied equivalent normalization and statistical analysis methods to generate the deg lists for the  <dig> compared platforms and the reference.

discrepancies of results between probes representing the same gene, observed on the affymetrix and illumina platforms  can be attributed to several factors, including cross-hybridization problems, probe binding to alternatively spliced transcripts and technical noise.

the most important factor influencing the discordance among microarray platforms is the criterion used to define the lists of differentially expressed genes  <cit> . to define gene lists we used the pc-value, fold change and the deg list size. the three different criteria are, of course, not independent but their combination may lead to very different results. one of the conclusions of the maqc project was that previously reported lack of agreement among lists of genes generated on different platforms was due to the use of a statistical significance threshold to define deg lists. maqc's authors  <cit>  and others  <cit>  recommended selecting gene lists with a non-stringent p-value cutoff combined to fold-change. our results  show that when a non stringent pc-value  combined to a fold change > <dig> are used, the number of differentially expressed genes is considerably larger for the affymetrix than for the illumina platform. the reason for this discrepancy is evident when examining the volcano plots  which show that for similar statistical significance, the fold-change is much less important for the illumina than for the affymetrix data. a fixed fold change is therefore inappropriate for comparing these  <dig> platforms. on the other hand, a relatively more stringent pc <  <dig>  criterion, irrespective of fold change, provided more consistent results between the  <dig> platforms . using this criterion, ~90% of the  <dig> genes in the illumina list and ~87% of the  <dig> in the affymetrix list were also present in the reference list. we then used a selection criterion combining a non stringent statistical significance threshold  and a "relative" fold change. in order to take into account the inter-platforms differences in the magnitude of change, the deg list was defined not by a fold change threshold but according to the size of the list . as shown in figure  <dig>  using this criterion, the overlap among the lists of the different platforms increases with the size of the list but reaches a plateau on the affymetrix and illumina lists when the size of the lists reaches approximately  <dig>  the list of "best 3800" was therefore considered as the most parsimonious list maximizing the overlap among platforms. as expected, the "best 3800" list corresponded to different fold change thresholds according to the platforms:  <dig>  for affymetrix,  <dig>  for illumina and  <dig>  for the reference.

a major aspect of microarray data analysis is the focus on classes of functionally related genes rather than on single genes  <cit> . this approach has not only increased the relevance of experiments conducted on a small number of biological replicates but most importantly it offers new perspectives that are only beginning to be explored in the area of systems biology. data analysis approaches investigating classes of related genes necessitate  <dig> steps: the selection of gene lists and the test of an over/under representation of genes belonging to these lists in a priori defined sets of genes representing functional classes. because the main interest is in statistical testing at the level of the functional classes, it may be appropriate to use a non-stringent selection criterion to constitute gene lists.

the approach used in this report to characterize gene enrichment based on go classes is one among several possible approaches that rely on various ontology or pathway databases and utilize different statistical methods to define gene lists and enrichment  <cit> .

using the pc <  <dig>  criterion, a smaller number of deg were identified within each go category than when using the "best-3800" gene list. this reduced number of identified genes was not always associated with a proportional decrease of the corresponding p-values for go enrichment. this may reflect both a greater specificity of the gene lists established using the pc <  <dig>  criterion compared to the "best-3800" genes criterion and a weaker influence of the adjustment for multiple testing.

the most relevant go categories identified by the reference list  were also significantly over-represented in the lists identified by the affymetrix and illumina platforms. they included several expected categories, such as "immunity and defense", "apoptosis", "intracellular signalling cascade" as well as categories characterizing general cellular metabolic activities, which are considered as prominent features of macrophages differentiation  <cit> , such as "protein metabolism", "carbohydrate metabolism" and "lipid, fatty acid and steroid metabolism". the complete lists of go categories over-represented in the lists of genes differentially expressed between monocytes and macrophages are reported in additional table  <dig> online .

overall, the illumina platform performed slightly better than the affymetrix one when the platforms were compared using the genes present on both types of array; whereas the reverse was true when the comparison was based on the whole set of gene present on each platform. this is certainly explained by the larger number of genes represented on the affymetrix than the illumina array . despite these differences, the results of the go analyses were remarkably similar between platforms in term of identified go categories, number of genes present within identified go categories and statistical significance.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this work compared the ability of two commonly used microarray platforms to characterize the differential gene expression profiles of human blood monocytes and macrophages. a third microarray technology applied to a larger number of experiments was used as reference. the results show that the criterion used to select the gene lists may considerably affect the results. a selection procedure coupling a non stringent p-value and "relative" fold-change identified a list of approximately  <dig> probes that optimized the overlap among deg lists identified on each platform. a functional analysis based on go enrichment demonstrated that the  <dig> compared technologies delivered very similar results and despite the small number of samples, they identified most of the relevant go categories enriched in the reference list.
