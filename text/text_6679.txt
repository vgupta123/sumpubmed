BACKGROUND
lysophosphatidic acid  is a lipid mediator that stimulates the proliferation, migration and survival of many cell types  <cit> . lpa acts through at least five distinct g protein-coupled receptors , termed lpa1– <dig>  which show overlapping signaling properties and tissue distribution  <cit> . lpa signaling has been implicated in a great variety of biological processes, ranging from embryonic development to wound healing and tumor progression  <cit> . this multitude of activities is consistent with the broad distribution of lpa receptors and their coupling to multiple g proteins. lpa is produced from more complex lysophospholipids by a secreted lysophospholipase d known as autotaxin , originally identified as an 'autocrine motility factor' for tumor cells . atx is essential for vascular development  <cit>  and in addition promotes tumor aggressiveness and angiogenesis  <cit> . this strongly suggests that lpa is a key pro-angiogenic factor during development and a signifcant effector of cancer progression in the stroma-tumor microenviroment.

although lpa-induced signaling pathways and cellular responses have been extensively analyzed over the years  <cit> , it remains unknown how lpa affects global gene expression in its target cells. gene expression analysis may uncover previously unknown activities of lpa, lead to a better understanding of gpcr signaling in general, and help to predict the behavior of cells in an lpa-enriched environment.

in this report, we analyze the global transcriptional response to lpa in mouse embryo fibroblasts . fibroblasts are abundant mesenchymal cells in the stroma of many tissues and organs where they regulate epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during development, tissue regeneration and tumor progression  <cit> . lpa has long been known to stimulate the proliferation and migration of fibroblasts  <cit> , while excessive lpa signaling in these cells can lead to fibrosis  <cit> . the present study identifies many novel lpa-regulated genes and shows especially that lpa commits fibroblasts, at the transcriptional level, to create a microenvironment that supports tissue remodeling, leukocyte recruitment, angiogenesis and tumor progression. since fibroblasts are also responsive to epidermal growth factor , acting on its cognate receptor tyrosine kinase, we examined in addition to what extent the lpa- and egf-induced expression patterns overlap.

RESULTS
characterization of mefs
we examined the mitogenic response and lpa receptor expression profile of immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts . stimulation of serum-deprived, nearly confluent mefs with saturating doses of lpa  resulted in a significant increase in dna synthesis to about 40% the level induced by 10% serum. egf  was somewhat less efficacious than lpa in stimulating dna synthesis . lpa signals via at least five distinct gpcrs  that couple to multiple g proteins, including gi/o, gq/ <dig> and g12/ <dig>  quantitative pcr analysis showed that our mefs co-expressed lpa <dig>  lpa <dig> and lpa <dig>  with lpa <dig> and lpa <dig> being the predominant transcripts . since mefs do not express atx , autocrine lpa signaling is not operative in our cell system.

the global transcriptional response to lpa
we examined the temporal program of gene expression in serum-starved mefs treated with lpa . total rna was isolated at different time points after lpa stimulation . global transcription profiles were determined using oligonucleotide microarrays containing  <dig>  mouse transcripts. amplified rna of the treated samples was matched with the untreated control and hybridized in duplicate with reversal of the cy <dig> and cy <dig> dyes; the normalized cy5/cy <dig> ratios were combined and used for further analysis. we selected genes that were significantly regulated  at two or more consecutive time points or in replicate measurements, which yielded  <dig> lpa-regulated genes . the entire dataset has been deposited in the ebi/arrayexpress database . we restricted our data set to genes that were induced by > <dig> -fold at two or more time points and grouped them according to the temporal profile of gene induction using k-means clustering. this resulted in ten clusters, each containing genes that show similarly shaped waves of transcription . seven clusters contained genes that were upregulated by lpa , whereas three other clusters mainly comprised the down-regulated genes  . the genes that were most strongly regulated at different time points are listed in additional file  <dig> . the microarray results were validated by examining the expression of  <dig> representative genes from different clusters using real-time pcr . the -fold inductions of expression generally were higher in the qpcr assays than in the corresponding microarray experiments, reflecting the different sensitivities of both methods . gene ontology analysis revealed that lpa regulated the expression of genes in multiple functional categories that mostly corresponded to the different gene clusters .

regulation of genes associated with growth regulation and cytoskeletal reorganization
upregulated genes
the immediate transcriptional response to lpa was characterized by > <dig> upregulated immediate-early genes  . this gene set contained various transcription factors associated with growth stimulation and cell cycle progression, notably genes encoding the ap- <dig> complex  and other growth regulatory genes . strong upregulation was also observed for ptgs <dig>  a highly inducible gene that encodes cyclooxygenase- <dig>  and has important roles in normal tissue homeostasis and inflammation. upregulation of some of these immediate-early genes, including egr <dig>  jun, myc and ptgs <dig>  has earlier been found in lpa-treated mefs and ovarian carcinoma cells  <cit> . lpa also induced the expression of genes encoding growth-regulatory protein kinases, including sgk <dig>  dyrk <dig>  nuak <dig> and map2k <dig> . in addition to these 'forward-driving' genes, the early gene clusters contained various 'feedback regulators' known to turn off gene expression and/or attenuate prolonged signaling . co-expression of both negative and positive regulators may be critical for the precise control of cell cycle progression. among the feedback regulators induced by lpa were transcriptional repressors , genes that promote the degradation of inducible mrnas  and a number of dual-specificity phosphatase  genes, notably dusp <dig>  dusp <dig>  dusp <dig>  and dusp <dig>  whose products attenuate the activity of map kinases  <cit> . it is further of note that lpa induced a very robust upregulation of mig- <dig> also known as errfi <dig> . mig- <dig> is a scaffold protein that interacts with the egf receptor to inhibit its catalytic activity and all downstream signaling events  <cit> . by upregulating mig- <dig>  lpa may keep fibroblasts poised to prevent uncontrolled egf receptor activation.

in addition to the above growth-regulatory genes, prominent upregulation was observed for genes whose products regulate the cytoskeleton, including various actin isoforms, vinculin and integrin alpha-subunits , consistent with lpa's function as a regulator of cell shape and motility .

downregulated genes
strongest downregulation of gene expression was mostly observed at ~4– <dig> hrs after lpa stimulation, i.e. coincident with the mid-g <dig> phase of the cell cycle . the most strongly down-regulated genes are listed in additional file  <dig> ; it comprises the transcription factor sox <dig>  recently identified as a mediator of metastasis  <cit> , the transcriptional repressor slug , an inducer of the mesenchymal phenotype and a marker of malignancy  <cit> , as well as genes that promote growth arrest. the latter set included the cell cycle inhibitors ccng <dig>  and cdkn1b , and the 'growth arrest-specific' genes gas1- <dig> and ccn <dig>  the latter gene encodes a growth inhibitory matrix protein  whose reduced expression promotes mesenchymal cell motility  <cit> . other strongly downregulated genes were nedd9/hef <dig> and cdh <dig>  the nedd <dig> scaffold is a downstream effector of focal adhesion kinase that may transduce integrin "inside-out" signaling to regulate cell-matrix adhesion and invasion  <cit> , while cdh <dig> encodes n-cadherin, a key regulator of intercellular adhesion strength in fibroblasts  <cit> . through the coincident loss of n-cadherin, nedd <dig> and ccn <dig>  together with the upregulation of secreted metalloproteases , lpa-stimulated fibroblasts may reduce their adhesive contacts and acquire a more motile and invasive phenotype.

induction of genes that encode secreted factors
aside from genes associated with cell proliferation and motility, the immediate-early and early clusters contained many genes that encode paracrine factors such as chemokines, cytokines, mitogens and pro-angiogenic factors that are involved in inflammation, tissue remodeling and wound healing. previous studies have shown that lpa induces the expression of the chemokine cxcl1/gro-alpha and the cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig> in ovarian cancer cells  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows a heat map for  <dig> selected genes that encode secreted factors, with the most strongly induced genes at the top of the map. these include genes encoding cxcl1/gro-alpha, il- <dig>  the egf family members hb-egf, epiregulin and amphiregulin, pdgf-a, csf- <dig>  vegf-a and the 'pro-fibrotic' and vasoactive ligand endothelin- <dig> . lpa also triggered robust upregulation of ccn1/cyr <dig>  and ccn2/ctgf . the ccn genes encode matrix proteins that control cell attachment and migration, but also are important players in the pathogenesis of fibrosis  <cit> .

components of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator  system, notably plaur  and the two major inhibitors of this system, plasminogen activator inhibitor- <dig>  and pai- <dig>  were also strongly upregulated by lpa. through its action on extracellular matrix and cell-surface proteins, the upa system modulates cell migration and cell-matrix interactions and thereby plays a key role in wound healing, angiogenesis and tumor progression.

genes encoding additional extracellular mediators and surface-exposed proteins were induced in a second wave of transcription with expression peaking at 4– <dig> hr after lpa stimulation . these included the chemokines ccl- <dig>  ccl- <dig> and cx3cl <dig>  the matrix metalloproteinases adam <dig> and mmp <dig>  and the transmembrane glycoprotein cd <dig>  which plays a key role in cell-cell interactions. a very strongly upregulated gene was ill1rl <dig>  which encodes an il- <dig> receptor family member . the secreted form of st <dig> inhibits the production of cytokines in inflammatory cells  <cit> . thus, st <dig> upregulation in lpa-stimulated fibroblasts may serve to temper inflammatory responses. consistent with our data, st <dig> was recently identified as major lpa target gene in osteoblastic cells, where it is thought to play an anti-inflammatory role during bone healing  <cit> . strong upregulation was also observed for tissue factor , a cell-surface glycoprotein that initiates the clotting cascade and has additional roles in cell migration and angiogenesis  <cit> . late upregulation  was observed for lgals <dig> and timp <dig>  lgals <dig> encodes galactin- <dig>  a mediator of inflammation, while secreted timp- <dig> has a role in wound healing and the creation of a prometastatic niche.

in conclusion, lpa-stimulated fibroblasts are transcriptionally committed to produce numerous factors known to act on nearby epithelial cells, leukocytes and endothelial cells. lpa stimulation thus enables fibroblasts to promote tissue remodeling, inflammation, angiogenesis, wound healing and, in a tumor context, cancer progression. a schematic representation of the lpa-induced gene expression program over time is shown in additional file  <dig> 

lpa dose dependence
the early cellular responses to lpa, such as cytoskeletal reorganization and migration, usually show their maximal induction in the submicromolar concentration range, while cell cycle progression requires 1– <dig> μm doses. we determined the dose-efficacy of lpa on gene transcription using three different concentrations  and analyzed expression profiles over time . the regulation of many lpa target genes was preserved at the lowest lpa dose tested . about 65% of all target genes showed significant regulation by lpa at all three lpa doses . increasing the lpa concentration caused increasingly stronger gene expression, often with more prolonged kinetics, as visualized by heat map  and quantitated for selected genes by qpcr . it is of note that many of the genes encoding secreted factors  reached their maximal expression already at  <dig>  μm lpa. "ingenuity" pathway analysis indicated that the functional categories modulated by lpa were preserved at all three concentrations, with the notable exception that lowering the lpa dose to  <dig>  μm led to a relative enrichment of genes associated with "cell movement" . this result is consistent with lpa's propensity to act as a motility factor and chemo-attractant rather than a growth factor in the lower concentration range.

expression profiles of lpa and egf show broad overlap, but at least  <dig> genes are differentially regulated
fibroblasts have long been used as a model to study peptide growth factor signaling. when stimulated by distinct peptide growth factors , fibroblasts show a strongly conserved gene-expression signature  <cit> . this is not too surprising since the cognate receptor tyrosine kinases  all use the same signaling principle. to our knowledge, however, it is unknown to what extent the transcriptional response to gpcr stimulation bears comparison with that to rtk stimulation in the same cell type. we therefore compared the temporal gene expression programs of lpa and egf in mefs at five different time points . we found that egf  induced many of the same genes as lpa , although lpa stimulation often led to a higher level of induction and/or more prolonged kinetics . for example, lpa caused a much more prolonged upregulation of the immediate early genes fos, dusp <dig> and cxcl <dig> than did egf . lpa was also more efficacious in inducing genes that encode paracrine factors  and components of the plasminogen activator system  . quantitative pcr analysis confirmed the differential regulation of selected genes by lpa and egf . a complete list of the differentially regulated genes is shown in additional file  <dig>  to what extent these quantitative differences reflect different expression levels of the respective receptors is currently unknown.

despite this large overlap of the lpa and egf expression profiles, approx. 7% of the genes  was differentially regulated by lpa . immediate-early genes that were upregulated by lpa, but not egf, include edn <dig> , fgf <dig>  nfkbia  and several protein kinase genes , as shown in additional file  <dig> . interestingly, lpa also induced the expression of a newly identified gpcr for lpa, termed p2y <dig> , which adds an element of feedback to the fibroblast response to lpa . at 2– <dig> hrs, more lpa-specific transcripts could be identified . gene ontology analysis revealed that the lpa-specific gene set was enriched for genes associated with cytoskeletal organization and integrin signaling, notably those encoding various actin isoforms , palladin , vinculin , an arp2/ <dig> subunit , calponins , a rho gtpase , rho-kinase , myosin x  and an integrin subunit  . specific upregulation of cytoskeleton-associated genes is in line with lpa's role as an efficacious regulator of cell shape and motility.

it has long been proposed that gpcr ligands such as lpa signal through 'transactivation' of the egf receptor  <cit> . according to this model, gpcr agonists rapidly activate the egf receptor to exploit the tyrosine-posphorylated receptor as a signaling intermediate. however, blocking egf receptor activity by the selective egf receptor kinase inhibitor ag <dig>  had no effect on lpa-induced map kinase activation, ccl <dig> expression and dna synthesis, while the responses to egf were fully inhibited . this is in agreement with a previous study showing that lpa mitogenic signaling in mefs does not require egf receptor tyrosine phosphorylation  <cit> . figure  <dig> illustrates that the transcriptional response to lpa was only little affected by egf receptor inhibitor treatment . about 15% of the lpa-induced genes  was >70% inhibited after drug treatment. otherwise, egf receptor inhibition did not affect the induction of key immediate-early and early genes by lpa, such as transcription factors and paracrine mediators. while it remains formally possible that basal egf receptor activity has a permissive effect on some lpa-induced signaling events, we conclude that lpa and egf signal independently to regulate broadly overlapping sets of genes in mefs. it thus appears that the transcriptional program induced by either lpa-gpcr or egf-rtk stimulation in fibroblasts is more strongly conserved than previously appreciated.

CONCLUSIONS
dissecting the transcriptional response to growth factors in selected cell systems may help to better understand various aspects of embryonic development, adult tissue homeostasis and cancer. the present study characterizes the global transcriptional program of mefs to lpa and thereby provides new insights into the normal physiological response of quiescent fibroblasts to this multifunctional lipid mediator. in addition to genes associated with cell proliferation, adhesion and migration, lpa induces a host of genes that encode secreted factors known to promote tissue remodeling, wound healing, inflammation, angiogenesis and tumor progression, depending on cellular context. this highlights the importance of lpa signaling in profoundly modifying the fibroblast microenvironment.

previous transcriptional profiling of serum-stimulated human skin fibroblasts has identified a 'core serum response'  that is characterized by cell-cycle-independent genes and reflects various aspects of wound healing, notably the induction of genes involved in matrix remodeling and re-epithelialization  <cit> . this fibroblast csr or "wound-response signature" is recapitulated in human carcinomas and may help predict tumor progression  <cit> . comparative analysis revealed, however, that the expression profile of lpa-stimulated mefs shows only limited overlap with the canonical csr of serum-stimulated human fibroblasts. at first sight, this result is somewhat unexpected since lpa is a major serum constituent  <cit> . on the other hand, serum is an ill-defined mixture of numerous bioactive factors and it is likely that the combined action of many different factors obscures the comparison between serum and lpa. moreover, mefs differ from human skin fibroblasts not only in their biological and anatomic origin, but also in their lpa receptor expression pattern . yet, it should be emphasized that lpa-stimulated mefs and serum-stimulated human skin fibroblasts both show a gene expression profile that is strongly associated with tissue remodeling as well as tumor progression.

of final note is our finding that the transcriptional response of mefs to lpa versus egf shows an overlap of >90%, at least qualitatively, despite the fact that lpa and egf signal via completely different mechanisms. lpa-induced gene expression was largely independent of egf receptor activity, which argues against the notion that lpa exploits the egf receptor as a signaling intermediate. the broad overlap between lpa- and egf-induced gene expression shows that gpcrs and rtks have more in common than previously appreciated. one should not conclude, however, that the transcriptional response to receptor stimulation is less dependent on the nature of the receptor than on the cell type. for example, the common expression pattern of lpa and egf shows hardly any overlap with that induced by wnt signaling in fibroblasts  <cit> . the great diversity of fibroblast responses to lpa as reported here is an important area for further study.
