BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is a versatile gram-negative bacterium, able to metabolise multiple carbon sources and exploit diverse ecological niches, e.g. soil, water, plants and animal hosts  <cit> . this opportunistic pathogen causes a range of human infections, including acute infections of severe wounds  <cit>  and burns  <cit>  and chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis  patients  <cit> . p. aeruginosa forms biofilms in the cf lung that are highly resistant to antibiotics and clearance by the immune system  <cit> . once established, such biofilms cannot be eradicated and are associated with greatly increased morbidity and mortality  <cit> .

several cf-associated transmissible strains of p. aeruginosa, capable of between patient transmission, have been identified in the uk, europe, australia and north america  <cit> . the liverpool epidemic strain , a uk transmissible strain, was first isolated in  <dig> at alder hey children’s hospital , liverpool  <cit> . this strain is capable of super-infection, supplanting pre-existing p. aeruginosa populations in the cf lung  <cit> . chronic infection with les is associated with increased morbidity and mortality compared to other p. aeruginosa strains  <cit> . the les is highly prevalent within individual hospital cf units  <cit>  and is the most abundant p. aeruginosa strain amongst cf patients in the uk  <cit> . it was also recently isolated from the sputa of cf patients in north america  <cit> .

sequencing of the earliest les isolate, lesb <dig>  demonstrated that the genome shares 95% similarity with the lab strain pao <dig>  however, its core genome is punctuated by multiple norfloxacin-inducible prophages  <cit> . specifically, there are five inducible prophage genomes  that are mosaic in nature. the gene organisation of lesφ <dig> and lesφ <dig> resembles that of lambdoid phages. these two phage genomes share  <dig> % identity across a  <dig> -kb region at their 3’ ends that makes up 32% of the phage genomes. the closest known relative to both these phages is the pseudomonas phage f <dig>  <cit> . lesφ <dig> also contains a  <dig>  kb region that shares  <dig> % homology with lesφ <dig>  which exhibits a considerable sequence similarity to the o-antigen converting phage d <dig>  <cit> . lesφ <dig> is a transposable mu-like phage that closely resembles phage d <dig>  <cit> . the lesφ <dig> sequence resembles a pf1-like filamentous phage  <cit> .

temperate phages have been shown to confer selective, beneficial traits to a range of p. aeruginosa hosts  <cit> . for example, phage d <dig> orchestrates o antigen conversion from o <dig> to o <dig> in pao <dig>  which may aid evasion of the immune system and resistance to phage superinfection  <cit> . phage φctx infection of pas <dig> results in conversion to a toxigenic strain  <cit>  and the filamentous phage, pf <dig>  has been associated with biofilm disruption and dispersal  <cit> . les prophages have been suggested to contribute to the competitiveness of their bacterial host in vivo. lesb <dig> mutants, with disrupted prophage genes, exhibited  <dig> to 1000-fold decreased competitiveness in a rat model of chronic lung infection compared to wild type lesb <dig>  <cit> . the les phages are induced by exposure to clinically relevant antibiotics, e.g. ciprofloxacin  <cit> , and free les phages and other tailed-phage virions have been detected in cf patient sputa  <cit> .

temperate phages are key vectors of horizontal gene transfer   <cit> . therefore, it is important to assess the ability of the les phages to infect other bacterial hosts to which they may confer traits beneficial to life in the cf lung environment. here we describe the infection characteristics of three of the five les prophages lesφ <dig>  lesφ <dig> and lesφ <dig>  induced from the sequenced cf lung isolate lesb <dig> 

RESULTS
les phage morphology
three different siphoviridae phages were induced from lesb <dig> cultures and visualised using electron microscopy. the phages possessed icosahedral heads  and long flexible tails . plaque assay of each phage on pao <dig> resulted in the formation of small turbid plaques with different phage-specific morphologies. lesφ <dig> plaques were the largest , with well-defined lysogen islands, whereas lesφ <dig> plaques were considerably smaller . lesφ <dig> produced plaques with small, clear centres surrounded by a turbid halo. the identity of each les phage responsible for the different plaque morphologies was confirmed using a multiplex pcr assay.

differential induction of les phages from lesb58
the sensitivity of the les phages to induction into the lytic cycle was determined and compared. real-time quantitative -pcr was used to measure relative increases in phage dna copy number following induction by exposure of lesb <dig> to norfloxacin. after exposure to norfloxacin for 60 min and recovery for 2 h, lesφ <dig> was the most abundant free phage detected , compared to lesφ <dig>  and lesφ <dig>  . furthermore, the increase in lesφ <dig> production between  <dig> and 60 min exposure times was higher  than that for lesφ <dig>  and lesφ <dig> . thus while norfloxacin induction caused a significant increase in the replication of all three phages , only lesφ <dig> showed significantly greater phage production after 60 min compared to 30 min norfloxacin exposure ; by contrast, the duration of exposure had no effect on phage production in lesφ <dig> and lesφ <dig> . we suggest therefore that lesφ <dig> is either more sensitive to induction by norfloxacin or that it replicates more rapidly once induced.

lysogenic infection of a model pao <dig> host
pao <dig> les phage lysogens  were created by infection of strain pao <dig> with each les phage and isolation of single colonies from turbid areas within plaques . challenge of plpls with different les phages, using plaque assays, revealed varying immunity profiles. table  <dig> lists the efficiency of plating  values of each les phage on each plpl lawn. prophages  <dig> and  <dig> conferred immunity to super-infection by lesφ <dig> and lesφ <dig> respectively . however, a few lesφ <dig> super-infection events were observed by detection of plaques following exposure of lysogens to  <dig> x  <dig> p.f.u ml- <dig> of lesφ <dig> . lesφ <dig> was able to infect plpls harbouring prophages lesφ <dig>  and lesφ <dig>  at the same efficiency as non-lysogenic pao <dig>  however, lysogens harbouring the lesφ <dig> prophage were resistant to infection by lesφ <dig>  and showed considerably reduced susceptibility to lesφ <dig> .

immunity profiles of each les phage were determined by plaque assay. phage dilution series were spotted onto non-lysogenic pao <dig> and plpl lawns. efficiency of plating = the ratio of plaques observed  on the most permissive host /plaques observed on assay host . if no plaques were observed when neat phage suspensions of  <dig> p.f.u ml- <dig> were used, an eop value < 1x10- <dig> was recorded.

spontaneous phage production by all seven plpls was higher than that associated with lesb <dig>  by 5– <dig> orders of magnitude  . these data suggest that les prophages are less stable in pao <dig>  with significantly higher rates of spontaneous lytic phage production than in lesb <dig>  little difference was observed in the levels of spontaneous phage production between single, double and triple pao <dig> lysogens.

les phages integrate at the same sites in different bacterial host strains
southern blot analysis was used to demonstrate that lysogenic instability was not due to integration of the les phages into unstable sites of the naive pao <dig> chromosome, or from multiple integration events of the same phage . lesφ <dig> and lesφ <dig> integrated as single copies at identical locations in lesb <dig> and pao <dig> chromosomes.

the lesφ <dig> int probe hybridised to an additional dna fragment in all lysogens containing lesφ <dig>  including lesb <dig>  the size of the additional hybridised fragment corresponds to one of two possibilities: 1) the integration of a second lesφ <dig> copy in to the chromosome directly downstream of the first; 2) an extra copy of lesφ <dig> in circular form . the published lesb <dig> genome sequence clearly shows a single lesφ <dig> copy in the chromosome. since the hybridisation pattern of the pao <dig> lesφ <dig> lysogen matches that of lesb <dig>  a second chromosomal copy can be ruled out. this suggests that the extra copy is circular, which may represent phage replication resulting from spontaneous activation of the lytic life cycle. alternatively, the extra copy may indicate pseudolysogeny, in which stable circular copies are maintained.

the lesφ <dig> ci probe indicated that lesφ <dig> is able to integrate in several chromosomal locations in pao <dig> 

les phages infect a narrow host range in a type iv pilus-dependant manner
from a well-characterised panel of  <dig> clinical p. aeruginosa isolates,  <dig> were susceptible to les phage infection. of  <dig> environmental isolates, representing  <dig> different pseudomonas species, only the p. aeruginosa strain was susceptible. in addition, pa <dig> was resistant to infection by lesφ <dig> and lesφ <dig>  but susceptible to lesφ <dig>  plaques on pa <dig> appeared less turbid than those on pao <dig> lawns. the host ranges of each les phage were not identical and no correlation was found between bacterial clone-type  <cit>  and susceptibility . in addition, other common gram-negative cf pathogens burkholderia cenocepacia and b. multivorans strains were resistant to infection by all three les phages .

a non-piliated pao <dig> mutant  was resistant to infection by all  <dig> phages, suggesting that lesφ <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> all require type iv pili for infection. the hyper-piliated mutant  was also resistant to the les phages, whilst an alternative hyper-piliated mutant  remained fully susceptible.

discussion
differential induction among co-infecting prophages
induction experiments demonstrated that lesφ <dig> virions were produced from lesb <dig> in greater numbers than the other phages. these data suggest that lesφ <dig> replication is more efficient than the other phages and could out number and therefore out compete the other, co-infecting les phages during the lytic cycle. potentially supporting this hypothesis, we detected an extra copy of this phage in the lesφ <dig> lysogen genome. southern analysis suggests the presence of either a pseudo-lysogenic plasmid form  <cit> , or a highly active replicative form of lesφ <dig> during spontaneous phage production.

the implications of within-host competition between co-infecting prophages has been little studied, however refardt et al. <cit>  observed hierarchical competition between multiple prophages in e. coli, which suggested that the sensitivity of the lytic switch can determine dominance of one prophage over another in a polylysogen. carriage of phages that are very prone to activation of the lytic lifecycle may represent a significant cost to their host cells, and thus could be selected against in natural populations. however, while natural isolates of les sampled from cf patient sputa often lack one or more of the les prophages  <cit> , there is no evidence that lesφ <dig> is more or less stably maintained than lesφ <dig> or lesφ <dig> 

les phages exhibit different immunity profiles
each phage conferred inhibition of superinfection by the same phage, although the mu-like phage, lesφ <dig> was observed to infect lesφ <dig> lysogens at a very low frequency. this may represent the development of rare mutations that affect immunity functions. there are several examples of such mutations in phage mu  <cit> . repressor/operator coevolution has been suggested to be the driving force for the evolution of superinfection immunity groups of lambdoid phages  <cit> . the same may hold true for mu-like phages. for example, mutation of the operator region has been shown to affect binding of the repressor in mu vir mutants  <cit> .

sequential infection of pao <dig> with different les phages revealed an interesting superinfection hierarchy. lesφ <dig> lysogens remained susceptible to lesφ <dig> and lesφ4; and lesφ <dig> lysogens were susceptible to lesφ <dig> and lesφ <dig>  however, lesφ <dig> prevented infection by lesφ <dig> and greatly reduced susceptibility to lesφ <dig>  such uni-directional infection exclusion has been reported between other phages, and is commonly associated with super-infection exclusion genes such as the lambda rex genes  <cit>  and siea, sieb and a <dig> in the salmonella phage, p <dig>  <cit> .

it is likely that lesφ <dig> and lesφ <dig> prophages would have been acquired before lesφ <dig>  because the infection hierarchy suggests that prior acquisition of lesφ <dig> would have prevented subsequent lesφ <dig> and lesφ <dig> infection.

les prophages in pao <dig> undergo spontaneous activation to the lytic cycle at a far higher rate than in lesb58
high levels of spontaneous induction were observed in plpls, suggesting that lysogeny is relatively unstable in the paol genetic background. we show that phage production remained high between plpls containing one, two or three les prophages, suggesting that polylysogens were no more or less stable than any single lysogens. southern analysis confirmed that lesφ <dig> and lesφ <dig> integrated into the same position in plpls as they did in lesb <dig>  therefore, the instability of plpls was not due to prophage integration into unstable sites. lesφ <dig> integrated in several alternative sites in plpls. the sequence of this phage shares a high level of genome synteny and homology with the transposable mu-like phage d <dig>  <cit> , whose random integration has been demonstrated to create mutations within the host chromosome. lesφ <dig> may play a similar role in les genome evolution.

the les phages exhibit a narrow host-range
our investigation of the les phage host range revealed narrow, overlapping host specificity. no association between bacterial clone-type and phage susceptibility was observed, although testing more strains may have identified a pattern. despite the high proportion of resistant clinical isolates, our data show that les phages are capable of infecting some p. aeruginosa strains isolated from keratitis patients and non-les infected cf patients. les phages have been detected in cf patients’ sputa, and may therefore allow mobilisation of genes between p. aeruginosa strains  <cit> . by contrast, les phages may allow les to displace other p. aeruginosa strains during superinfection in the cf lung  <cit>  by lysing susceptible resident strains  <cit> .

les phage infection is type iv pilus-dependent
we demonstrate that les phage infection is dependent on the type iv pilus, which is required by p. aeruginosa for adhesion, biofilm formation and twitching motility  <cit> . this important surface structure is commonly used as a receptor by diverse pseudomonas phages  <cit> . both non-piliated  and hyper-piliated  pao <dig> mutants were resistant to infection by all three les phages. however, a different hyper-piliated mutant  remained susceptible. these findings mirror other pilin-dependent p. aeruginosa phage studies  <cit> . hyper-piliated mutants are incapable of twitching motility due to abrogated pili retraction. these data suggest that retraction is involved in the infection process by lesφ <dig> lesφ <dig> and lesφ <dig> 

despite infecting via an important and common surface structure, all three les phages exhibited narrow host ranges and each showed strain specificities. for example, lesφ <dig> was able to infect pa <dig> and several keratitis isolates that were resistant to infection by the other les phages. it is likely that many clinical strains of p. aeruginosa harbour prophages that may belong to the same immunity group and therefore exclude super-infection by one or more of the les phages  <cit> . alternatively, resistance could be achieved by loss or modification of the type iv pili receptor  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we demonstrate that the les phages exhibit differential sensitivities to induction, narrow host ranges and divergent infection behaviour in the model host pao <dig> compared with the native lesb <dig> host background. extensive genotypic and phenotypic variation has been observed in clinical les populations  <cit> , including changes in the number of resident les prophages  <cit> . these phages may, therefore, be important contributors to diversity of the les populations.
