BACKGROUND
numerous genetic manipulation strategies have been developed to study complex interactions between gene expression and behavior. these strategies are essential to study the role and function of genes in complex systems such as the brain  <cit> . gene manipulation strategies are designed to alter the genetic makeup in certain cells or tissue types either by over- expressing or knocking down specific genes. some of the common methods currently being used for this purpose are traditional transgenic animal technology  <cit>  and the relatively newer method utilizing recombinant viral vectors  <cit> .

within neuroscience, recombinant viral vector technology allows the targeting of localized populations of neurons or other cell types within specific parts of the nervous system. recombinant viruses engineered to harbor transgenes of interest can be infused directly into desired brain regions where the virus can then transduce cells within the region of the infusion to deliver its transgene cargo thereby genetically modifying the targeted cells  <cit> . one of the greatest benefits of this technology is that it allows the genetic manipulation to be introduced at virtually any point in the organism’s life span quickly and easily. this is especially valuable in behavioral neuroscience research since the virus/transgene can be introduced before or after behavior experiments; thereby allowing it to be determined how the precise genetic manipulation specifically modifies specific aspects of the organism’s behavior  <cit> .

the adeno-associated virus  is an ideal virus to use for in vivo purposes since it is well tolerated in vivo and can be easily produced within the laboratory at titers necessary for this use. aav does not cause disease and does not induce a significant inflammatory or immune response in vivo <cit> . this class of viruses also exhibits stable and long lasting transgene expression and a wide range of infectivity  <cit> . numerous aav serotypes have been isolated from adenoviral stocks  <cit> , from humans  <cit>  and from primate tissues  <cit> ; some aav serotypes have also been engineered by directed evolution  <cit> . these aav serotypes possess three different capsid proteins: virion proteins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> . of these, vp <dig> is the largest capsid protein of the three, while vp <dig> and vp <dig> are produced through differences in splicing and translation initiation. variations in the capsid protein amino acid composition among the aav serotypes contribute to each serotype’s ability to transduce particular cell types  <cit> .

among the different aav serotypes, aav <dig> has been the most commonly used in neuroscience research, however; recent studies have determined that the transduction efficiency of this serotype is sub‒optimal for some brain cells and tissues  <cit> . these studies are incredibly important because they underscore that the choice of virus/serotype should be made wisely since all aav serotypes may not necessarily transduce the target cell/tissue intended. unlike traditional transgenic animal technology that typically genetically manipulates every cell or specific cell type within the whole organism, recombinant viral vector technology must be optimized to achieve transduction of as many cells as possible within the desired region. optimal transduction is dependent on the viral titers that can be achieved and the efficiency of a particular virus for transducing a particular cell type.

here we examined the ability of  <dig> different aav serotypes  in their ability to transduce neurons within the basal and lateral amygdala . targeting neurons within the bla is of great interest for many in the neuroscience community due to the role of the bla in emotional learning and memory  <cit> , and psychiatric disorders  <cit> ; importantly there are no previous reports on how effective these serotypes are at transducing neurons within the bla.

RESULTS
pseudotyped viruses are essentially identical, except for their capsid proteins
to examine how aav serotypes may differ in their intrinsic ability to transduce neurons within the basal and lateral amygdala  an aav <dig> genome plasmid harboring a red fluorescent protein gene, under the control of the neuron specific mouse αcamkii promoter   <cit> , was pseudotyped into nine different aav serotypes . these pseudotyped viruses are essentially identical, except for their capsid proteins, vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig>  sequence analysis of the largest capsid protein for each of these serotypes  highlights the degree to which these serotypes differ . notably aav <dig> differs the most relative to the other serotypes, exhibiting ~40% sequence divergence from these serotypes. the genetically engineered serotypes aavdj, and aavdj <dig> are very similar to each other; their closest relative is aav <dig>  most of these serotypes differ by ~10-20%.

serotypes of aav produce differing viral yields
following viral purification, the viruses were titered using a qrt-pcr based method to determine the number of viral genome copies per ml from dnase resistant viral particles. this method of titering provides the most accurate method to quantitatively compare viral yields from differing serotypes because it does not depend on viral transduction efficiency, which may naturally differ among serotypes. following titering of these nine different viruses, it became apparent that there were large differences in the titers achieved for some of these serotypes . aav2/ <dig> produced the lowest titer and aav2/ <dig> produced the highest titer. to ensure that the aav2/ <dig> titers were not due to an anomaly with the aav <dig> serotype plasmid, aav2/ <dig> virus was produced again using a different aav <dig> serotype plasmid obtained from another source  and it is referred to here as aav2*. both aav2/ <dig> and aav2/2* produced lower titers as compared to the other  <dig> serotypes produced. because some variability in viral titer following large scale viral purification is to be expected, we next examined the ability of these serotypes to produce packaged virus using a crude viral lysate from a small scale experiment performed in triplicate . this small scale viral production experiment yielded similar findings to the large scale experiment: aav2/ <dig> produced significantly lower viral yields compared to the other serotypes. aav2/ <dig> is not however the only virus that is prone to producing lower yields upon large scale viral production. for example, when the aav <dig> genome plasmid harboring an rfp gene  was pseudotyped as aav2/ <dig>  it produced titers that were on the lower end of viral yields as compared to the other serotypes that were purified . when another aav <dig> genome plasmid referred to here as aav-misc was used to generate fully purified viruses that were pseudotyped as aav2/ <dig> and aav2/dj <dig>  aav2/dj <dig> consistently produced viral titers in the range of 3e +  <dig> gc/ml, while aav <dig> produced approximately  <dig> fold lower titers .

aav serotypes differentially transduce neurons within the rat bla
we next examined whether these  <dig> aav serotypes differ in their ability to transduce neurons within the bla . because it was unknown what viral titer would prove optimal for infusion into the bla, we first bilaterally infused each serotype at the highest titer achieved for each serotype . twenty one days following viral infusion, the rats were sacrificed, perfused and the amount of viral transduction was examined for each serotype throughout the entire amygdala  . since multiple viral particles are capable of transducing individual cells within the target region, and therefore able to deliver a differential number of copies of the rfp transgene to the target cells, it is necessary to measure the intensity of rfp fluorescence  and the spread of viral transduction  to adequately measure efficiency of viral transduction among differing serotypes. additionally, because targeted viral infusions within the rodent brain, even under the best circumstances will not entirely localize viral transduction to the intended target region, we specifically measured the intensity and spread of rfp fluorescence for the entire transduced region in each examined amygdala-containing coronal slice  and we refer to these measurements as “total”. we also measured the intensity and spread of rfp fluorescence within the bla to determine “bla only” measurements. the total and bla only measurements are graphed side-by-side .

in this experiment it became clear that high viral titers did not guarantee high viral transduction. for example, aav2/ <dig> had the highest titer of any serotype produced, but transduced bla neurons modestly with respect to many of the other serotypes examined. at the titers achieved for aav2/ <dig> and aav2/2*, no viral transduction was observed within the bla. serotypes aav2/dj <dig> and aav2/ <dig> possessed the highest level of transduction of bla neurons in this experiment. notably there was a high level of viral transduction that spanned the entire anterior-posterior axis of the bla , without any noticeable damage to the tissue.

in our first experiment , we infused the viruses at differing titers, however; to examine aav serotype transduction efficiency of bla neurons quantitatively it was necessary to infuse the viruses at the same viral titer. in the next experiment, these serotypes were bilaterally infused into the rat bla at a normalized titer of  <dig> e +  <dig> gc/ml and  <dig> days following viral infusion the rats were sacrificed and the degree of transduction was quantitated throughout the amygdala as described above . in addition the number of transduced cells was determined for the entire viral transduction  and for transduction confined to the bla  . it was necessary to use a longer exposure time to capture the viral transduction images for this experiment since generally fewer viral particles were infused into the bla as compared to the previous experiment. these data depicted in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  therefore, cannot be directly compared to data depicted in figures  <dig> and  <dig> .

these viruses exhibited differential transduction of neurons within the bla. it is of interest that aav2/ <dig>  exhibited the lowest viral transduction efficiency  as compared to the other  <dig> serotypes examined . these findings were unambiguous since aav2/ <dig> consistently did not transduce cells within or around the bla across replicates within this experiment. aav serotypes 2/ <dig>  2/ <dig>  2/ <dig>  2/ <dig>  2/rh <dig>  2/dj, and 2/dj <dig> exhibited relatively comparable levels of transduction efficiency, with aav2/ <dig> exhibiting a trend for the highest level of transduction. tables containing the p-values from statistical comparisons among the serotypes for mean viral transduction , mean viral spread  and mean number of transduced cells  are provided in . aav2/ <dig> and aav2/2* were not included in this experiment because the titers achieved for these viruses did not exhibit transduction of bla neurons and these titers were below  <dig> e +  <dig> gc/ml.

the viruses utilized within this study were designed to express rfp from a neuron specific mouse αcamkii promoter and therefore regardless of the cell type these viruses transduce, only αcamkii positive neurons would likely express the rfp. to examine if this prediction held true, we performed immunohistochemistry on bla containing coronal slices that were transduced with serotypes 2/ <dig>  2/ <dig>  2/ <dig>  2/ <dig>  2/rh <dig>  2/dj, and 2/dj <dig> since these serotypes exhibited bla transduction in the previous experiment. the proportion of rfp expressing cells that were also neun positive was examined and it was determined that ~98% of rfp expressing cells were also neun positive indicating that the rfp signal predominantly came from neurons . these data are consistent with the fact, that for the aav serotypes examined thus far within the rodent central nervous system, all of them predominantly transduce neurons  <cit> . next the proportion of rfp expressing cells that was also immuno positive for αcamkii protein was examined. it was determined that ~85% of rfp expressing cells were also αcamkii positive .

discussion
the impetus for this study was based upon the observation that for aav-mediated gene delivery to the bla to be truly effective, a large number of pertinent cells would need to be transduced and this would require using an aav serotype that efficiently transduces the cell types of interest within this region, at titers that can be realistically obtained. numerous studies have previously reported that the degree of viral spread and transduction within particular brain regions and cells can vary depending on aav serotype  <cit> . for example, one study discovered that aav2/ <dig> displayed greater transduction and spread compared to aav2/ <dig> and aav2/ <dig> in numerous regions within the mouse brain  <cit> . another study found that aav2/ <dig> did not transduce the dentate gyrus or ca <dig> effectively, which was in contrast to aav2/ <dig>  instead, aav2/ <dig> infected the hilar region of the dentate gyrus  <cit> . these studies underscore the importance of determining which aav serotype most effectively transduces the cell population/brain region of interest since some serotypes may not transduce all cell types or brain regions well. however these previous studies only examined a few serotypes and none of these previous studies compared the abilities of differing aav serotypes to transduce bla neurons. because of this it was necessary to screen aav serotypes in their ability to transduce neurons of the bla. we specifically sought to determine which serotypes are optimal for transducing αcamkii positive neurons within the bla since these neurons are critical for synaptic plasticity relevant for amygdala dependent learning and memory  <cit> . to accomplish this, we utilized an aav <dig> genome plasmid that was designed to express rfp under the control of an αcamkii promoter, to direct the expression of rfp predominantly in glutamatergic excitatory neurons  <cit> . our approach was collectively unique among studies comparing differences among aav serotypes in transduction ability of the rodent brain in multiple ways. first, we examined  <dig> different serotypes, the most of any other study. second, we are the first to report transduction efficiency of aav2/dj and aav2/dj <dig> within the rodent brain, and third, we examined neuron transduction utilizing an expression system that was controlled by an αcamkii promoter, whereas all previous studies comparing serotypes within the rodent brain utilized expression systems that were controlled by general promoters  and chicken β-actin ) that drive expression in all cell types or pan-neuronal promoters  that drive expression in all neuronal types.

our study revealed that of the  <dig> serotypes we examined, aav2/ <dig> consistently produced the lowest yield of virus when produced under standard laboratory conditions and it was incapable of transducing neurons within the bla at the titer achieved . in contrast aav2/ <dig> and aav2/dj <dig> produced much higher titers , and possessed the greatest overall transduction of bla neurons at these titers among the serotypes tested. given its cited use, it is of great interest that aav2/ <dig> consistently produced the highest titer of any serotype examined, but it possessed a modest ability to transduce neurons within the bla therefore making it a less favorable choice for targeting neurons within the bla. interestingly aav2/ <dig> exhibited not only the lowest transduction efficiency of bla neurons, but it is also the serotype with the most divergent capsid protein sequences as compared to the other serotypes examined. the aav <dig> vp <dig> capsid sequence is ~40% different as compared to the other  <dig> aav serotypes, suggesting that aav5′s significant vp <dig> sequence divergence is associated with reduced bla neuronal transduction. aav serotypes 2/ <dig>  2/ <dig>  2/ <dig>  2/ <dig>  2/rh <dig>  2/dj, and 2/dj <dig> exhibited comparable levels of transduction efficiency, with aav2/ <dig> exhibiting a trend for the highest level of transduction.

using a small scale crude viral preparation it was revealed that aav serotypes differ in their intrinsic ability to produce packaged virus; specifically that aav2/ <dig> produced significantly less virus as compared to the other serotypes examined. it is important to note that the differences in viral yield among the other serotypes to each other were relatively minor in this experiment. an important advantage of using the small scale crude viral preparation is that the viral yield is not dependent on the purification method  and therefore differences in the viral yield can be attributed to the virus itself. additionally, there were relatively large differences in yields of the fully purified aav-rfp virus among some of the serotypes. moreover, when aav-misc was pseudotyped as aav2/ <dig> and aav2/dj <dig>  the aav2/ <dig> titers obtained were consistently ~10fold lower as compared to aav2/dj <dig>  these differences might not be due to variations in the production of each serotype, but may be due to differences in how efficiently differing serotypes are purified using the iodixonal gradient method.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion this study determined that aav serotypes differ in their ability to produce virus and differ in their ability to transduce neurons within the bla. based on the ability of aav2/dj <dig> to produce high titers and transduce neurons within the bla exceptionally well at these titers, our lab has begun to routinely utilize aav2/dj <dig> in our ongoing experiments designed to target the bla.
