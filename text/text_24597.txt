BACKGROUND
segmental duplications  are among the most rapidly evolving and dynamic loci in the human genome  <cit> . these loci are operationally defined as sequences greater than 1 kb in length with over 90 % sequence similarity to a locus elsewhere in the genome  <cit> . ectopic recombination between homologous sds can give rise to large deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations, including structural mutations associated with human disease  and rearrangements that may have contributed to the evolution of uniquely human traits . one subtle, yet ubiquitous, outcome of non-allelic homologous recombination is interlocus gene conversion , or the unidirectional transfer of sequence from one sd to a paralogous sd . in this manner, igc functions as a “copy-and-paste” mechanism that imparts two characteristic signatures on the evolution of duplicated sequences. first, igc decreases divergence between paralogous sds. the active exchange of variants between duplicates can drive their concerted evolution  and may even permit the retention of functional similarity between ancient sds  <cit> . second, igc increases haplotype diversity within duplicated sequences  <cit> , thereby expediting their adaptive evolution and promoting the maintenance of exceptionally high levels of allelic diversity . on the other hand, igc can also introduce deleterious alleles into functionally important genomic contexts. indeed, igc is a well-established mechanism of human disease  <cit> , accounting for approximately 1 % of de novo disease alleles  <cit> .fig.  <dig> detecting signals of historical interlocus gene conversion in polymorphism data. a an igc event can transfer an allele from one paralog to another, resulting in shared polymorphic sites or “parallelisms”. b to systematically identify such sites, high-quality paralog alignments can be integrated with dense polymorphism data to identify aligned positions that are polymorphic in both paralogs and segregate identical alleles. c such sites may also arise by parallel mutation events that occurred independently during the independent evolution of each paralog. however, parallel mutation should more frequently result in aligned polymorphic positions that segregate alternative alleles 



although a handful of exceptional gene families show signals consistent with frequent igc , overall, igc appears to have had a modest effect on patterns of between paralog divergence in the human genome. benevoy and drouin  identified longer-than-expected stretches of perfect sequence identity in pairwise paralog alignments, a genetic signature indicative of historical igc. the authors concluded that  <dig>  % of duplicated coding positions in the human genome have likely been converted by igc  <cit> . mcgrath et al.  used a gene-tree species-tree reconciliation strategy to estimate that  <dig>  % of duplicated sites in the human genome have been directly converted  <cit> . jackson et al.  and dumont and eichler  used a third approach based on the identification of fine-scale switches in the phylogenetic tree relating paralogs to derive estimated conversion rates of ~4-5 %  <cit> . together, these diverse methods converge on a set of common conclusions: the rate of igc inferred from patterns of paralog divergence is too low to mar the true evolutionary history of most duplicated loci in the human genome, and estimates of divergence times based on sequence comparisons between duplicated loci are usually not deflated by igc-driven sequence homogenization.

naively, the limited footprint of igc on patterns of between paralog divergence in the human genome may also be predicted to extend to its effects on within paralog polymorphism. however, there are at least two reasons to speculate that igc may have left a more pronounced stamp on levels of within paralog diversity in the human genome. first, the human population has experienced rapid, super-exponential population growth over the last ~ <dig> generations  <cit> . as a result, most segregating variants in human populations are young, low frequency alleles that are unlikely to have fixed between paralogs. by definition, these segregating variants cannot be used to characterize the impact of igc on patterns of between paralog divergence, although they may contain information about how this mechanism affects levels of within paralog diversity. second, many igc-derived alleles are potentially deleterious . although low fitness genotypes may contribute to transient polymorphism, negative selection should effectively purge deleterious alleles before they leave a footprint in patterns of sequence divergence.

one powerful approach for identifying igc signals embedded in dna diversity data is to mine population genetic datasets for one-to-one paralogous positions that are polymorphic for identical alleles  . approximately 35 % of segregating sites in the first five exons of the human rhce gene are also polymorphic at corresponding positions in the paralogous rhd locus  <cit> , and over 10 % of variants in both the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein gene cluster  <cit>  and the human luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin β gene cluster  <cit>  are shared among paralogs. these case studies highlight the important contributions of igc to patterns of segregating diversity within single gene families, but it remains unclear how igc’s effect on diversity at these extraordinary loci extrapolates to its role as a general mechanism of dna variation across duplicated regions of the genome. despite the availability of whole-genome sequences from large population samples, the genome-wide mutagenic impact of igc on human polymorphism has never been directly quantified.

toward this aim, i leverage well-annotated segmental duplications in the human genome and snp calls from population genomic sequences generated by the  <dig> genomes consortium to systematically catalog  <dig>  pairs of shared polymorphic positions at one-to-one paralogous sites. i show that these paralogous snp pairs are most parsimoniously interpreted as the outcome of historical igc events, rather than the consequence of parallel mutation events. together, my analyses demonstrate that a small, albeit significant, fraction of variants in duplicated sectors of the human genome have arisen by the recombinogenic process of igc rather than by conventional point mutation.

RESULTS
igc between duplicated loci can introduce shared polymorphisms at one-to-one paralogous positions . using snp calls from  <dig>  low coverage whole genome sequences released by the  <dig> genomes project and  <dig>  global pairwise alignments between well-annotated paralogous sequences in the human reference genome, i identified  <dig>  duplicated single nucleotide positions segregating identical alleles. over  <dig>  of these parallel snp pairs overlap regions where the alignment between paralogs is potentially low quality . excluding these possible alignment artifacts leaves  <dig>  putative parallel polymorphic snp pairs in the human genome , including  <dig>  sets of ≥ <dig> paralogous snps that segregate identical alleles. together, snps at these positions  account for  <dig>  % of all  <dig> genomes snps intersecting regions of high quality alignment between duplicated sequences .table  <dig> number and frequency of parallelisms in human segmental duplications



for ease, i will refer to a pair of parallel polymorphic snps as a parallelism. i use the term “parallel snp” to refer to either of the two constituent snps in a parallelism.

eliminating likely false positive parallelisms due to multiple mappings
short sequence reads derived from duplicated regions may map to multiple loci in the genome and lead to false positive genotype calls. in particular, redundant or incorrect mappings between highly identical duplicates could generate artificial parallelisms and lead to the spurious inference of igc. to mitigate the effects of this important and likely source of error, i eliminated snp calls associated with reads that map to multiple locations in the human reference genome . this filtered call set contains  <dig>  snps in duplicated regions that are uniquely taggable in the context of short-read paired-end mapping. within this set of uniquely mapping snps, there are  <dig>  parallelisms composed of  <dig>  parallel snps that together account for  <dig>  % of all uniquely mapping snps within sds .

not surprisingly, the majority of parallelisms that are eliminated by the unique read mapping filters occur in high-identity duplicated regions that cannot be reliably distinguished by short reads. specifically,  <dig>  % of redundantly mapping parallelisms lie in duplicated regions with >95 % sequence identity, and  <dig>  % fall in regions with >99 % pairwise sequence identity . in contrast, only  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of uniquely mapping parallelisms are located in paralogous sequences with >95 % and >99 % psi, respectively .

to confirm that uniquely mapping short paired-end reads can accurately identify snps in duplicated regions, i validated a subset of parallelisms using 15× whole genome sequence and ~ <dig>  fosmid clone insert sequences from a gujarati indian individual  not included among the  <dig> genomes samples  <cit> . because of their large insert sizes , fosmid clone sequences will map to a single position in the genome with near certain probability, thereby eliminating the multiple placement problem associated with short read shotgun sequencing. a total of  <dig>  parallelisms were identified from snp calls based on the whole genome sequence of gm <dig>  including  <dig> that were also identified in the  <dig> genomes snp data. the majority of parallelisms identified in gm <dig>  contain variants that are not found in the  <dig> genomes dataset. although a subset may involve snps that are specific to the gujarati indian population, many are likely artifacts arising from incorrectly mapped short reads, cryptic structural variation, or genotyping errors introduced by modest sequence coverage.

 of the  <dig> parallelisms shared between the gm <dig> and  <dig> genomes samples, eleven are covered by at least five fosmid clones at both parallel positions . at these loci, the probability that only one allele is represented among the sequenced clones is at most 2 ×  <dig>  =  <dig> , assuming no allele bias. these clone-based sequences validate ten of the eleven shared parallelisms , providing a compelling proof-of-principle demonstration for the power of uniquely mapping short reads to identify snps in a paralog-specific context. the sole exception involves the putative parallelism between snps rs <dig> and rs <dig>  for which only one allele is represented among the five fosmid clones overlapping each snp.

controlling for the effects of parallel mutation
an alternative biological interpretation for shared polymorphisms is independent mutation events to identical nucleotides at paralogous sites . multiple, independently derived estimates of the de novo rate of igc in the human genome converge on a per site, per generation frequency of ~10− <dig> . this rate is approximately 100-fold higher than the de novo point mutation rate , and even exceeds the rate of mutation at hypermutable cpg dinucleotides by an order of magnitude  <cit> . although igc is the most parsimonious interpretation for shared polymorphisms, i conservatively exclude  <dig>  parallelisms containing snps within hypermutable cpg dinucleotides from downstream analyses. the final, filtered dataset includes  <dig>  parallelisms composed of  <dig>  unique polymorphic sites .

to further assess the extent to which mutation may confound the signal of igc, i conducted two additional analyses on this final parallelism dataset. first, assuming that a given nucleotide mutates to any other nucleotide with equal probability, two out of every three parallel mutation events should yield aligned, paralogous snps that segregate alternative alleles . in contrast to this prediction, pairwise sd alignments harbor a clear excess of shared polymorphic sites . over 94 % of paralog alignments contain more parallelisms than expected given the observed number of one-to-one snp pairs with three nucleotides . second, i performed a series of coalescent simulations  <cit>  to determine the expected frequency of parallelisms in a subset of  <dig> randomly selected sd alignments . for  <dig> of the  <dig> sd alignments considered in this simulation study, significantly more parallelisms were observed than expected if mutation were the sole evolutionary force creating them .fig.  <dig> the number of parallelisms exceeds expectations under mutation-only null models. a the observed number of parallelisms in each pairwise paralog alignment is plotted against the number of one-to-one aligned polymorphic sites that segregate alternative alleles. b the observed number of parallelisms in a random set of  <dig> paralog alignments is plotted against the expected number of parallelisms derived from coalescent simulations. in both plots, the dashed red line corresponds to the null expectation assuming equal mutation rates to all nucleotides 



properties of parallelisms are consistent with the mechanism of igc
the distribution of parallelisms in the human genome recapitulates several patterns that are consistent with igc, providing additional evidence for their origin via this mechanism. first, igc is more frequent between intra-chromosomal duplicates than between inter-chromosomal sds  <cit> . whereas  <dig>  % of analyzed sd alignments involve sequences located on the same chromosome, 67 % of parallelisms are between intra-chromosomal snps . this represents a significant excess over the number expected if parallelisms occur randomly within duplicated sequence space . second, many parallelisms concentrate within previously characterized igc hotspots in the human genome, including the rhesus blood group antigens rhd and rhce on 1p <dig>   <cit> , the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein cluster on chromosome 19q <dig>  <cit> , olfactory receptors  <cit> , and the hla locus  <cit>  . third, parallelisms strongly cluster within many paralog alignments , a pattern reflecting the possible co-transmission of multiple linked sites within a single igc track or the cumulative effects of multiple overlapping tracks from independent igc events initiated at a common hotspot locus. finally,  <dig>  % of parallel snp pairs segregate in the same  <dig> genomes population, consistent with the intra-genomic transfer of one allele to a second locus via igc. this percentage exceeds that in  <dig> simulated datasets composed of allele frequency matched snp pairs drawn at random from the full  <dig> genomes snp call set .fig.  <dig> the distribution of parallelisms across four pairwise alignments. aligned sequences are depicted as horizontal black lines. protein coding features are represented by thick red boxes, with untranslated sequences marked by the thinner rectangles. the positions of parallelisms within each alignment are shown by vertical gray lines connecting the two aligned sequences. a alignment between duplicons spanning hla-drb <dig> and hla-drb <dig> on 6p <dig>  b alignment of segmental duplications that include olfactory gene clusters in the subtelomere of the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  several clusters of parallelisms between these duplicons are evident, including six parallelisms between or2t <dig> and or2t <dig> and a group of four in the ~5 kb region downstream of or2t <dig> and or2t <dig>  c alignment between the tandem inverted rche/rhd duplication on 1p <dig>  d alignment involving a duplicon spanning the 3’ end of cyp2f <dig>  a cluster of parallelisms in the middle of this alignment includes sites in the 3’ utr of this gene



hotspots of interlocus gene conversion
i have uncovered evidence for historical igc involving  <dig>  % of uniquely mapping, non-cpg snps in sds. accounting for nested redundancies in the data due to sets of > <dig> paralogous snps , i estimate that  <dig>  % of snps in duplicated regions of the human genome have arisen via the mutagenic action of igc . this overall percentage conceals considerable variation among individual paralog pairs in the human genome . in fact, the majority of paralog alignments harbor no high-confidence parallelisms , whereas igc between other duplicated sequences is rampant, accounting for upward of 10 % of all uniquely mapping variants . for example, there are three high-confidence parallelisms  between the tandem duplications spanning exons 4– <dig> of the duox <dig> and duox <dig> genes on 15q <dig> . over 20 % of all snps observed in regions of high quality alignment between these duplicons are involved in a parallelism, suggesting that ~10 % of variants in these genes have arisen from historical igc events . similarly, of the  <dig> snps observed in high quality aligned regions between ifitm <dig> and ifitm <dig> on 11p <dig> ,  <dig> are implicated in parallelisms . approximately 10 % of snps in these duplicated genes are also likely the direct by-product of igc /87 =  <dig> ).

in addition to these gene-level igc hotspots, there are  <dig> snps  that have potentially seeded new snps at multiple paralogous acceptor loci . many of these higher order parallelisms involve sites in tandem duplicate clusters, a structural confirmation associated with frequent, recurrent non-allelic homologous recombination . in particular,  <dig>  % of higher order parallelisms involve ≥ <dig> snps within 5 mb of each other . the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein  gene cluster on 19q <dig>  provides an especially striking example. psg genes are abundantly expressed in the placenta during pregnancy and are vital for safeguarding the developing fetus from infectious agents in the maternal bloodstream  <cit> . across the  <dig> tandemly duplicated genes in this family, there are  <dig> higher-order parallelisms, including three 4-dimensional parallelisms and one parallelism involving five snps . many of these higher dimensional parallelisms involve coding snps, raising the possibility that igc between psg paralogs has played a role in the adaptive protein evolution of this gene family.

population-specific signals of historical igc
many parallelisms are composed of at least one snp that is private to one of the  <dig> populations represented in the  <dig> genomes snp data . more than half of these “private parallelisms” are specific to one of the three surveyed african populations , an expected consequence of higher dna diversity in these populations. at the extremes, the luhya population of kenya has  <dig> private parallelisms, whereas the iberian population of spain has just  <dig> parallel polymorphic sites that are not observed in any other population. these population-specific parallelisms likely reflect historical igc events that occurred in the population harboring the private allele. private alleles are often evolutionarily young  <cit> , a point that supports the interpretation that most population-specific parallelisms have probably arisen from igc events in recent human history.

several genes harbor multiple population-specific parallelisms . of the  <dig> high confidence parallelisms identified in dpp <dig>  eight are unique to the yoruba, seven to the luhya, and four are exclusive to the british population. this gene shows signals of recent adaptive protein evolution  <cit>  and variants in the regulatory region of dpp <dig> are associated with ventricular fibrillation  <cit> . there are two ceph-private parallelisms in srr, a gene that has been previously implicated in schizophrenia  <cit> . such patterns point to locus and population-specific effects of igc on genetic diversity, and suggest potential differences in susceptibility to igc-mediated disease in individuals with alternative ancestries.

discussion
i have identified a set of snp pairs in the human genome that represent outcomes of historical igc events. although my approach cannot polarize these snps into donor and acceptor sites, i can confidently deduce that one of the two constituent parallel snps arose as a consequence of the mutagenic action of igc, not point mutation. as more high-depth whole genome sequences for diverse unrelated individuals come offline  <cit> , methods based on sequence read depth at uniquely mappable positions in the human genome can be used to systematically distinguish between donor and acceptor alleles .

despite this limitation, the sites i identify collectively comprise a catalog that will empower future investigations on igc. this resource will be especially useful for deriving biologically relevant parameter values and fine-tuning evolutionary models to accurately reflect observed patterns of human polymorphism in duplicated genomic regions . in addition, empirical analyses on the spatial distribution of parallelisms across the genome and their relationship with respect to various sequence properties may provide insights into the molecular mechanism of igc, including whether the process is biased toward transmission of g and c alleles, like allelic gene conversion. although none of the parallel snps in high quality parallelisms are known causal disease variants, newly discovered disease variants in sds can be rapidly crosschecked against this database to deduce the molecular processes responsible for their origin.

this analysis has focused exclusively on snps, but the approach taken here can be readily extended to include other variant types such as indels and multinucleotide variants. moreover, this general method for identifying igc signals can be applied to other species with population genomic data. this straightforward extension will facilitate comparative studies on the evolution of the mechanism of igc, including comparisons of its impact on dna sequence variation in diverse organisms.

although differences in power between divergence-based and polymorphism-based methods for detecting igc signals make it difficult to directly compare estimates  <cit> , results from this analysis suggest that human polymorphism data is not a richer reservoir of historical igc signals. the estimated  <dig>  % of snps in human sds that have arisen from igc is commensurate with estimates derived from fixed differences between paralogs in the human genome  . three considerations, however, suggest that this polymorphism-based figure is an underestimate of the true number of igc-derived sites in sds. first, although some parallelisms may be false positives due to the confounding effects of mutation, my quality control pipeline for filtering snps likely discarded many more false negative signals. in particular, restricting my focus to only non-cpg parallelisms eliminates  <dig>  % of uniquely mapping parallelisms with high quality alignments . snps at cpg dinucleotides account for 44 % of all  <dig> genomes snps in sds, indicating that this class of highly mutable sites is not markedly enriched in the context of parallelisms. second, owing to ambiguities in read placement, highly identical duplicated sequences cannot be queried using short read sequencing data, even though existing evidence points to the possibility that these sequences experience the highest de novo rates of igc  <cit> . as a result, the current analysis has focused disproportionately on the detection of exchange events between more divergent sds that have potentially experienced lower rates of historical igc.

finally, this study has systematically mined the human genome for one specific signature associated with igc: shared, parallel snps. igc events that span fixed differences between paralogs can also lead to de novo snps. if igc occurred recently, the minor snp allele will likely correspond to the fixed base at a paralogous position. across the pairwise alignments analyzed here, there are  <dig>  snps with minor allele frequency ≤ <dig>  at which the minor allele is fixed at a paralogous position. this corresponds to  <dig>  % of all snps in duplicated sequence space and  <dig>  % of all snps in segmental duplications  with minor allele frequency ≤ <dig>  . however, alternative evolutionary scenarios can generate an identical genetic signal, without a requirement for igc. for example, positive directional selection or random drift could lead to the near fixation of a new allele in one duplicate. complex population genetic simulations are needed to determine the relative fraction of these signals that is attributable to igc, an effort that will ultimately yield a more accurate estimate of igc’s impact on diversity in the human genome.

regardless of the precise number of segregating variants due to igc, the finding that a non-negligible fraction of snps within human sds are not due to mutation per se, but rather the mutagenic action of igc bears directly on the continued study of these functionally significant regions of genome. first, as a consequence of variant input via igc, sds may harbor more diversity than expected under neutral evolutionary models. elevated diversity relative to null expectations is commonly a signature of loci evolving under positive darwinian selection  and is also a hallmark of balancing selection  <cit> . thus, it is imperative that efforts to infer selection in duplicated sequences either  explicitly account for the confounding role of igc or  demonstrate a lack of evidence for igc. second, empirical population genetic parameter estimates for these regions, such as the population mutation rate  and the number of segregating sites , will be inflated by mutational input from igc. third, the fate of deleterious and disease-associated alleles in sds may not be appropriately modeled using standard predictive frameworks. a variant that is deleterious in the context of one paralog may persist in populations at igc-selection balance if it is neutral  in the context of a second paralog  <cit> . such a scenario is especially likely to hold for parallelisms that involve one genic variant and one variant in a non-coding pseudogene. additionally, the mechanism of igc may constitute a form of meiotic drive that can override the effects of purifying selection on deleterious alleles, enabling them to persist in populations at higher-than-expected allele frequencies or even fix  <cit> . finally, as a consequence of igc, an allele that physically maps to a genomic locus in one individual’s genome may map to a distinct position in the genome of other individuals. this positional ambiguity poses a major obstacle to de novo assembly and accurate short-read mapping in genomic regions with recurrent igc. the continued development of novel experimental methods with the precision to query variants within high copy genomic sequences will not only meet this challenge  <cit> , but will also foster deeper understanding of the mutational impact of igc in the human genome.

CONCLUSIONS
here, i have used publicly available population genomic data from the  <dig> genomes project in conjunction with well-annotated duplicated sequences to identify  <dig>  shared, polymorphic snps between one-to-one aligned duplicated positions in the human reference genome. i have carefully shown that these parallelisms are not the consequence of redundant read mappings in multi-copy genomic regions and that they cannot be explained by parallel mutation events. i conservatively estimate that at least  <dig>  % of snps in duplicated regions of the human genome have arisen as the consequence of igc, not point mutation. these findings underscore the importance of an often over-looked mechanism of human genomic diversity – including possible disease alleles – and bear on the interpretation of polymorphism patterns across the ~5 % of the human genome that lies in segmental duplications.
