BACKGROUND
bifidobacteria have been isolated from several ecological niches linked to the gastro intestinal tract  of animals, including the human git, where they represent prominent members of the gut microbiota  <cit> . bifidobacteria have attracted significant scientific and commercial interest due to their purported health-promoting or probiotic effects conferred to their  host, such as strengthening/maintenance of the intestinal barrier, modulation of the immune system, and pathogen exclusion  <cit> .

fourty eight different bifidobacterial species are currently recognised, including nine subspecies, and of these only fifteen species are represented by fully assembled genome sequences, of which there are currently fifty four publicly available . multiple genome sequences are available for certain bifidobacteiral species allowing for pan-genome analysis, which is the total number of different genes encoded by a certain species  <cit> . recent studies have deduced the pan-genome for bifidobacterium breve  <cit>  and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis  <cit> , while another focussed on the genomic diversity of bifidobacterium adolescentis  <cit> . in order to map the evolutionary development of the bifidobacterium genus, an extensive comparative study was recently performed on individual representatives of  <dig> bifidobacterial species  <cit> . one of these comparative studies suggests that bifidobacteria and their animal hosts co-evolved, and that this co-evolution was facilitated by both gene loss and acquisition events to allow for species-specific adaptations to a glycan-rich environment  <cit> .

functional genome analysis of bifidobacteria is important in order to understand how this species adapts to a particular niche. for example, more than 8 % of the annotated genes found in the genomes of b. longum and b. breve are predicted to encode proteins involved in the metabolism of complex plant-derived carbohydrates  <cit> . in contrast, the human genome is predicted to encode just seventeen enzymes involved in glycan catabolism  <cit> . it is believed that this paucity is compensated by the metabolic abilities provided by the gut microbiota, including bifidobacteria, thus allowing the  host to  digest complex polysaccharides that would otherwise be deemed non-digestible. it is therefore important to obtain an in depth understanding of carbohydrate utilisation by gut commensals and its impact on their host.

despite the generally held view that bifidobacteria elicit positive health effects on their host, the underlying molecular mechanisms are as yet far from fully understood  <cit> . one of the key reasons for this knowledge gap is the difficulty in genetically modifying bifidobacteria, in part attributed to the presence of restriction-modification  systems  <cit> , which provide a powerful and natural defence for prokaryotic cells against invading foreign dna, in particular bacteriophages  <cit> . r-m systems are currently classified into four well characterised types, i, ii, iii and iv, based on their co-factor requirements, protein composition, and target/cleavage sequence characteristics  <cit> . type i r-m systems consist of three subunits that are responsible for methylation, specificity and restriction, respectively, and recognise asymmetric sequences that comprise of two components that are separated by a non-specific spacer. type i r-m systems require s-adenosylmethionine , atp and mg2+, typically methylate adenine residues and cut unmodified dna at sites distal to the recognition sites  <cit> . classical type ii r-m systems recognise palindromic sequences of 4–8 bp in length and cut dna into discrete fragments within or close to the recognition site  <cit> . the type ii r-m methyltransferase  modifies adenosyl or cytosyl residues of a particular recognition sequence, which, when unmethylated, is recognised and cut by the corresponding restriction endonuclease   <cit> . type iii r-m systems consists of two subunits that are responsible for dna recognition and modification , and dna cleavage . type iii r-m systems recognise inversely orientated asymmetric dna sequences, where the res subunit cuts the dna close to one of these recognition sites  <cit> . finally, type iv restriction enzymes differ from those previously described as they recognise and cleave dna only when the recognition site is methylated  <cit> .

independent studies in bifidobacteria have demonstrated that following modification of plasmid dna, r-m systems can be by-passed, thereby resulting in a substantial increase in transformation efficiency and in some cases the successful generation of mutants  <cit> . in a recent study, data gained from methylome analysis led to a moderate improvement in the transformation efficiency of the strain bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis cncm i- <dig>  <cit> . however, overcoming r-m systems of a given species is but one tool of the expanding bifidobacterial genetic tool box, which now includes conjugation-based methods  <cit> , a temperature-sensitive plasmid  <cit>  and a double-crossover, marker-less gene deletion system  <cit> .

in this study we present the complete genome sequence for b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> and b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig>  and associated methylome and r-m analyses. comparative analysis of the genomes of these two strains with publicly available complete and incomplete b. longum genomes enabled us to explore the genomic diversity among members of the b. longum subspecies longum, infantis and suis. in addition, by exploiting methylome and genomic data analysis, we were able to assess the functionality of the r-m systems native to b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig>  this allowed us to improve the genetic accessibility of b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig>  permitting site-directed mutagenesis of this strain.

RESULTS
general features of b. longum genomes
the complete genome sequence was determined for two b. longum subsp. longum strains that had been isolated from infant faeces  or a human adult intestine . salient details of each of these genomes are presented in table  <dig>  the observed g + c% content of both b. longum genomes  is consistent with that reported for other bifidobacterial genomes  <cit> . the genome of b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> contains a substantially higher number of trnas compared to most other sequenced b. longum strains, although a similarly high number of trna-encoding elements is present in the genome of strain b. longum subsp. infantis atcc  <dig>  <cit> . blastp analyses of deduced proteins of all identified orfs in both b. longum genomes was performed against the cluster of orthologous groups  database and the obtained results show that a high percentage of predicted proteins is dedicated to general cellular housekeeping functions including amino acid transport and metabolism, and carbohydrate transport and metabolism . these percentages are consistent with those previously observed for other bifidobacterial genomes  .table  <dig>

further exploration of the sequence data revealed that both genomes encode a single homologous phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system . this system exhibits 34 % identity across 99 % of the query sequence to a fructose-specific pep-pts system encoded by b. breve ucc <dig>  <cit> . in relation to carbohydrate-active enzymes,  <dig> glycosyl hydrolases  were identified in b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig>  whereas b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> is predicted to encode  <dig> ghs . the b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> genome specifies ghs that belong to thirteen different gh families, while the b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> genome is predicted to specify ghs that are from fifteen different gh families. interestingly, both genomes are predicted to encode a high number of ghs that belong to the gh family  <dig>  b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> is predicted to encode twelve members of gh family  <dig>  seven of which are predicted to be extracellular . b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> on the other hand is predicted to encode fourteen gh <dig> family members of the, of which nine are predicted to be extracellular . many members of the gh <dig> family represent inverting enzymes active against long-chain carbohydrates , which are typically constituents of plant cell walls and represent so-called non-digestible dietary fibers, such as arabinoxylan, arabinan, galactan and xylan  <cit> . such predicted plant polysaccharide-degrading activities had previously been described for the b. longum subsp. longum ncc <dig> genome, when it was reported that, according to cog functional classification, more than  <dig>  % of the predicted proteins encoded by this strain were associated with carbohydrate metabolism and transport.

synteny and variability of b. longum subsp. longum genomes
to investigate the syntenic relationship between the two newly sequenced b. longum genomes, dotplot comparisons were constructed using b. longum subsp. longum ncc <dig> as the reference genome. the resulting dotplots between the genomes of b. longum subsp. longum ncc <dig> and b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> reveal a near continuous straight line indicating a high level of synteny . the comparison between b. longum subsp. longum ncc <dig> and b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> reveals a break in genome synteny due to the presence of an apparent dna inversion. this inversion concerns a  <dig>  bp region on the b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> genome. examination of this ccug  <dig> region by pcr confirmed that this dna inversion is genuine, and apparently stable, thus representing a distinctive feature of this genome .

various extracellular structures encoded by bifidobacteria have been associated with host colonisation and gut persistence, interaction with the host immune system , such as pili or fimbriae and surface-associated eps   <cit> . b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> and b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> also contain genetic information for such extracellular structures . the individual seps clusters identified in b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> and b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> appear to lack one or more critical functions: the seps-specifying cluster in b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> encodes a single glycosyl transferase  , but does not contain a flippase- or other gt-encoding genes, while that of b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> does not appear to encode a priming gt or polymerase . these observations are consistent with the sedimenting phenotype of these two strains during planktonic growth , which was also observed for a b. breve ucc2003-derived mutant carrying a deletion in the gene cluster responsible for seps production  <cit> .table  <dig>

bifidobacteria appear to be subject to regular phage attacks, events that are expected to contribute to variability within bifidobacterial genomes  <cit> . in light of this, searches for prophage-like elements revealed that b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> and b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> harbor prophage-like elements . the prophage-like element identified in b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> appears to be complete, whereas b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> appears to harbor a single, apparently incomplete prophage-like element . comparative analysis reveals that the prophage-like elements identified here differ from each other and that they are integrated at different locations. although integrated at different positions within the genome, both prophage-like elements identified in b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> and b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> are integrated in a trnagly gene. the genome of b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> also harbors a putative 25 kb episome integrated in a trnaasn gene  <cit>  .

pan-genome analysis
in order to evaluate the total gene repertoire of currently sequenced representatives of the b. longum species, we applied a pan-genome analysis pipeline  <cit> . a total of thirty three b. longum genomes  were included in this analysis. where relevant, genome sequences were subject to re-annotation using the same annotation procedure described previously so as to ensure that all annotations and identified orfs were comparable .

the resulting pan-genome curve suggests an almost closed b. longum genome, which grows by an average of  <dig> genes per genome for the first thirty iterations after which the number of new gene families begins to decrease . this means that, after addition of the 30th genome, any further genome additions will result in only minor increases of the pan-genome. analysis of the core-genome, which represents those gene families for which there is a member present in each of the strains analysed, reveals an asymptotic trend, essentially stabilizing after the 30th genome addition at  <dig> genes   <cit> .fig.  <dig> pan-genome and core-genome of b. longum.
a the pan-genome plot is of the accumulated number of new genes against the number of genomes added. b the core-genome plot is represented by the accumulated number of genes attributed to the core-genomes versus the number of added genomes. the resulting functions for both plots are also reported



to identify genes that may confer a species-specific adaption, the core b. longum genome was compared to those of b. breve, b. bifidum, b. animalis and b. adolescentis which have been reported elsewhere  <cit> . such differences may be a reflection of different colonisation strategies employed by the b. longum species. the most striking difference is the presence of b. longum-specific genes involved in the transport and metabolism of certain carbohydrates. more specifically, the b. longum core-genome contains genes that are predicted to encode xylanases, arabinofuranosidases, and associated abc transporters which were found to be absent in the b. breve, b. bifidum, b. animalis and b. adolescentis core genomes. this indicates that the conserved ability to metabolise certain, possibly xylose/arabinose-containing plant-derived carbohydrates confers an adaptive advantage to the b. longum species.

phylogenetic analysis of b. longum indicates a novel subspecies
up until very recently, three b. longum subspecies were recognized, i.e. longum, infantis and suis, although originally classified as three separate species . the most recent classification of the three b. longum subspecies is summarised in additional file 3: table s <dig>  this summary briefly outlines the environments from which each subspecies has been isolated, typical cell morphology of each subspecies and subspecies-specific carbohydrate fermentation patterns. a fourth subspecies, b. longum subsp. sullium, was recently recognized based on multi-locus and amplified–fragment length polymorphism approaches and urease activity, members of which had previously been classified as b. longum subsp. suis  <cit> .

in order to analyse the phylogeny of the thirty three sequenced b. longum strains, which include representatives of three b. longum subspecies, a b. longum phylogenetic supertree was constructed employing the deduced protein sequences of the b. longum core-genome as conserved molecular markers . a sequenced representative of the fourth b. longum subspecies was not available and so could not be included in this study. as illustrated from the resulting consensus tree, two major clades are evident . the first clade consists of a group of twenty five highly related strains, the majority of which are members of the subspecies longum taxonomic group . interestingly, b. longum subsp. infantis 157 f and b. longum subsp. infantis ccug  <dig> are placed within this cluster. it is evident from the resulting consensus tree that both of these strains have been taxonomically miss-assigned and are in fact members of the subspecies longum.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of b. longum. a phylogenetic supertree showing the relationship between thirty three complete and incomplete bifidobacterial strains and l. salivarius ucc <dig> as an outlier



the second clade is split into three distinctive phylogenetic groups . as expected the three  animal isolates, b. longum subsp. suis lmg <dig> , b. longum subsp. suis dsm <dig>  and the non-subspeciated strain b. longum agr <dig>  are clustered together . the phylogenetic analysis performed here did not result in the identification of the subspecies sullium group, which is not surprising as no representative genome of this subspecies was available.

there is no clear separation between b. longum subsp. infantis atcc  <dig> and b. longum subsp. infantis ek <dig>  which form group b, a single subspecies infantis phylogenetic group . interestingly, three strains  form a separate phylogenetic group , indicative of a fourth phylogenetic subgroup. both b. longum subsp. longum jdm <dig> and b. longum bxy <dig> are human isolates, whereas b. longum subsp. longum cmccp <dig> represents a faecal isolate from a healthy infant. it is also worth noting that both b. longum subspecies longum jdm <dig> and b. longum subspecies longum cmccp <dig> are routinely used in commercial probiotic products  <cit> . b. longum subsp. longum jdm <dig> has been routinely grown in a stable and rich nutritional medium for a long period of time, whereas b. longum subsp. longum cmccp <dig> has been used in probiotic compounds for more than twenty years  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that this phylogenetic group has formed from strains that have evolved within industrial settings . however, this cannot be established with certainty as it is unknown whether b. longum bxy <dig> is a commercially used strain.

interestingly however, of all strains considered in this phylogenetic analysis and with the exception of b. longum subsp. longum bbmn <dig>  the strains in group c are the only chinese isolates. therefore, it is also possible that this fourth phylogenetic subgroup may represent a fifth subspecies which may be more prevalent amongst the chinese population. however, validation of such a fifth subspecies and its possible geographical delineation will require further genome sequencing of additional b. longum isolates.

a phylogenetic approach using seven house-keeping genes has previously been used to differentiate between bifidobacterial  species and it was found that this method allowed for a significant increase in the discriminatory power between taxa as compared to more traditional methods, for example 16 s rrna alignments  <cit> . this approach was explored using several housekeeping genes and the resulting phylogenetic tree was the same as that generated from the core b. longum genome .

in silico prediction of b. longum metabolic capabilities
to elucidate possible correlations between the genomic content of the analysed b. longum strains and particular phenotypic abilities, we analysed the predicted metabolic capabilities of each strain . taking into account the current subspecies classification, b. longum subsp. infantis atcc  <dig> and b. longum subsp. infantis ek <dig> are characteristic representatives of the infantis subspecies . the genome sequences of both strains reveal that they are typical human milk oligosaccharide  utilisers and that they encode a considerably lower number of ghs that are associated with the catabolism of plant-derived polysaccharides . this was verified phenotypically for b. longum subsp. infantis atcc  <dig>  which is unable to utilise plant-derived polysaccharides and the pentose sugars arabinose and xylose, which represent the monosaccharides that are found in many plant-derived polysaccharides .table  <dig> presence or absence of lnb/gnb, sialic acid and hmo gene clusters in all b. longum genomes

in silico analysis revealed that group a strains  are characteristic members of the longum subspecies  and are tailored towards the metabolism of plant-derived carbohydrates . a high variability in the number of predicted ghs, specialised in the degradation of plant polysaccharides, was observed across all analysed genomes from these group a subspecies longum representatives . phenotypic analysis demonstrated the ability of b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> and b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> to utilise various plant-derived polysaccharides and plant-associated pentose sugars . as is characteristic for members of this subspecies, the strains located in group a lack the majority of genes that have previously been shown to be required for hmo utilisation .

both b. longum subsp. suis strains analysed adhere to the current classification of the suis subspecies as both strains are isolated from porcine faeces and have a predicted ability to metabolise a range of different carbohydrates including pentoses . in addition, both strains encode a near complete sialic acid metabolism cluster, yet appear to lack the sialidase-encoding nanh, presumed to be responsible for removing terminal sialic acid residues from oligosaccharides found in hmos and/or mucin  <cit> . though nanh is absent in both strains, they may still be capable of growth on sialic acid as each strain is predicted to possess the transport system necessary for the internalisation of sialic acid  <cit> . the third animal isolate, b. longum agr <dig>  is more similar to members of the subspecies longum as this strain only harbours a partial sialic acid metabolism cluster.

genomic data analysis of the strains b. longum subsp. longum bxy <dig>  b. longum subsp. longum jdm <dig> and b. longum subsp. longum cmccp <dig> provides further evidence that these strains may represent a distinct subspecies . these strains do not fit the current classification for the three b. longum subspecies as these strains are predicted to metabolise plant-derived polysaccharides, yet also appear to possess a considerable number of hmo-metabolising capabilities .

assessment of genetic accessibility and methylome analysis
firstly, to investigate how genetically accessible b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> and b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> are, the transformation frequency of two e. coli-bifidobacterial shuttle vectors, ppkcm <dig> and pam <dig> was determined . the approach for this involved introducing plasmid dna that had originated from both b. longum subsp. longum strains  whereas plasmid dna isolated from e. coli ec <dig> was used as a control. it is worth noting that, as the plasmid dna is isolated from two different microorganisms with different isolation protocols, there may be differences in the purity of plasmid dna used for transformation, which could be a confounding factor. a three-log increase in transformation efficiency was observed for pam <dig> and a single-log increase in transformation efficiency was observed for ppkcm <dig> when the respective plasmid dna had been isolated from b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> relative to the situation when dna isolated from e. coli had been used for the transformation . unfortunately, we were unuable to introduce either of the two plasmids in b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> and therefore could not test this strain. these results indicate that b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> encodes functional r-m systems that negatively impact on the transformation efficiency of this strain when unmethylated dna is used. b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> is also likely to encode one or more potent r-m systems given its complete recalcitrance to transformation.table  <dig> bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study

genome analysis of b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> and b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> clearly indicates that each strain specifies one or more complete r-m systems and/or orphan mtases . methylome analysis was also employed  which allowed for the identification of a number of distinct methylation recognition sequences . it should be noted that methylated cytosines are not faithfully detected and require specific detection methods  <cit> .table  <dig> r-m systems of b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> and b. longum subsp. longum ccug 30698

this analysis revealed the recognition motif 5′-g6matnnnnntgcc-3′ in b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig>  and the two recognition motifs 5′-accnnnnnrttg-3′ and 5′-gcannnnnnnntgc-3′ in b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> . these motifs are reminiscent of type i r-m recognition sequences  <cit>  . both strains are indeed predicted to encode a single and apparently complete type i r-m system encompassing a single hsdm subunit, multiple hsds subunits, and a one hsdr subunit, responsible for modification, restriction and sequence recognition specificity . it has been observed that in other organisms possessing multiple hsds subunit-encoding genes, novel specificities can be generated by recombination events among such hsds sequences  <cit> .

b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> is also predicted to encode one complete type ii r-m system and one orphan type ii r-m n- <dig> cytosine mtase . based on rebase interrogation, the rease associated with the complete type ii r-m system is predicted to recognize the dna sequence, 5′-ccwgg-3′ . however, methylome analysis only identified one type ii recognition motif, 5′-tcggm4ccga-3′, which we predict to be associated with the presumed orphan type ii mtase . b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> is also predicted to encode a type ii r-m system that is represented by an rese and n6-adenine mtase. based on comparisons to rebase and methylome analysis, we predict that this type ii r-m system recognises the motif, 5′-ctgcm6ag-3′ . rebase searches also revealed the presence of what appears to be two orphaned type ii mtases and an incomplete type iii r-m system . finally, a potential type iig r-m system was identified; based on the rebase searches and methylome data we predict that this r-m is associated with the recognition motif 5′-cgggm6ag-3′ .

individual effects of b. longum r-m systems on transformation efficiency
based on the methylome data obtained and comparative analysis performed on the identified r-m systems, we wanted to verify that both b. longum strains encode mtases that protect the respective genomic dna. this could only be tested for those r-m systems that are predicted to recognise the motifs 5′-ccwgg-3′ and 5′-ctgcag-3′ as commercial restriction enzymes that recognise these particular motifs are available. as expected the genomic dna from b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> was protected from restriction with ecorii , while it was digested by psti . conversely and as expected, genomic dna from b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> was protected from restriction with psti, while it was cut by ecorii .

the type ii r-m systems of b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> encompass the mtase-encoding genes blmncii and blmnciii, while the type i r-m system encompasses the hsdm-encoding gene m.blmnci, and the  hsds-encoding genes s <dig> blmnci, s <dig> blmnci and s <dig> blmnci. the effect of each individual r-m system on the transformation efficiency of b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> was investigated, whereas we did not pursue this for b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> as this strain was non-transformable . for this purpose, each gene encoding an mtase and specificity subunit  were cloned in e. coli ec <dig> and with the exception of s <dig> blmnci, all genes were cloned together with their presumed native promoter-containing region .

plasmids pam <dig> and ppkcm <dig> were introduced into e. coli ec <dig> derivatives that harboured plasmids pwsk29-mss.blmnci or pnzem-m.blmncii. plasmid preparations of the resulting pam <dig> and ppkcm7-containing e. coli ec101-derivative strains were used for b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> transformation. as positive controls pam <dig> and ppkcm <dig> plasmid dna was isolated from b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> , whereas pam <dig> and ppkcm <dig> plasmid dna isolated from e. coli ec <dig> acted as the negative control .

the highest observed transformation efficiency was achieved when plasmid dna was isolated from the e. coli ec <dig> derivative harbouring plasmid pnzem-m.blmncii . this observation is not surprising as the motif associated with this mtase has the highest number of occurrences on pam <dig> compared to the other recognition motifs identified . our data indicate that the type i r-m system present in b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> does not have a negative effect on transformation efficiency. this result may be due to the low number of recognition motifs present on pam <dig> that are associated with this type i r-m system or to the possibility that this system is inactive . the transformation efficiency for the positive control  is still 10-fold higher than that achieved for plasmid dna isolated from the e. coli ec <dig> derivative harbouring plasmid pnzem-m.blmncii, which suggests that the latter plasmid is not fully protected against the endogenous restriction activity of ncimb  <dig>  furthermore, the second type ii r-m system present in b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> does not negatively impact on the transformation efficiency of this strain and may be due to the fact that this r-m system is non-functional.

disruption of the arfb in b. longum subsp. longum ncimb 8809
the arfb gene was selected as a mutational target in order to determine whether methylation of the non-replicating plasmid by the b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> mtase m.blmncii would increase transformation efficiency to allow for site-specific homologous recombination. the arfb gene encodes a putative α-l-arabinofuranosidase  predicted to be involved in the degradation of the plant-derived carbohydrate arabinoxylan through the hydrolysis of α-l-arabinofuranosyl residues from the xylan backbone of arabinoxylan. the dna fragment of 579 bp, representing an internal fragment of the gene arfb, was cloned in pori <dig> to generate construct pori19-arfb . the pori <dig> derivative, pori19-arfb, was provided with the tetracycline marker, tetwmod, resulting in the plasmid, pori19-tetmod-arfb. we used a synthetic tetwmod gene, which is free of ecorii restriction sites compared to the original tetw sequence which contains a total of seven ecorii sites  restriction ). there are two ecorii sites present in the selected internal arfb fragment, whereas the non-replicative pori <dig> plasmid contains just a single ecorii site . this pori <dig> derivative is unable to replicate in b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> as it lacks a functional replication protein  <cit> . in order to methylate the constructed plasmid pori19-tetmod-arfb, this plasmid was introduced into e. coli pnzem-m.blmncii, expressing the type ii mtase from b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig>  restriction analysis revealed that plasmid pori19-tetmod-arfb  was protected from restriction with ecorii . restriction analysis also revealed that the un-methylated pori19-tetmod-arfb plasmid  was subject to restriction by ecorii .

methylated pori19-tetmod-arfb was then introduced into b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> via electroporation. several tetr transformants were obtained and analysed by colony pcr, which indeed verified that the individual pori19-derivative had integrated at the expected chromosomal location. to assess the phenotypic effect of the gene disruption created in arfb, a selected mutant, designated b. longum subsp. longum ncimb 8809-arfb, was analysed for its ability to grow on mmrs supplemented with arabinoxylan as the sole carbon source. in contrast to  b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig>  the arfb-mutant exhibited a complete inability to grow on both rye and wheat arabinoxylan  .fig.  <dig> phenotypic analysis of the b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> insertion mutant strain. growth profile analysis of b.longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig>  and b.longum subsp. longum ncimb 8809-arfb  in modified rogosa broth supplemented with lactose, rye arabinoxylan or wheat arabinoxylan



this result shows that arfb is required for growth of b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> on arabinoxylan. based on the predicted function of arfb we speculate that this enzyme cleaves the arabinose substitutions from arabinoxylan and that the released arabinose moieties are then internalized and metabolised.

CONCLUSIONS
comparative genomics of bifidobacteria may be very helpful in order to expand our understanding of bacterial-host interactions, whereby they may elicit health benefits, and of the ability for bifidobacteria to adapt and compete in the intestinal environment. the full genome sequencing of two human b. longum isolates and the subsequent analysis of all complete and incomplete b. longum genomes allowed for the description of the pan- and core-genome for the b. longum species. this analysis revealed that the b. longum pan-genome is essentially closed and that the genomes included in this analysis are likely to be sufficient in describing the genetics and derived biology of this bifidobacterial species.

it is evident from the determined genome sequences, which are comparable to other fully sequenced b. longum genomes, that b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig> and b. longum subsp. longum ccug  <dig> possess various genetic adaptations and associated ecological fitness to suit life in the git. in light of the current b. longum subspecies classification, the phenotypic, phylogenetic and in silico analysis presented here has provided evidence for the existence of a novel phylogenetic type, which may represent a fifth subspecies. to determine whether further subclassification is desirable and can be justified, additional sequencing of b. longum isolates genomes is required. we also propose an amendment to the description of the subspecies infantis in that members may have capabilities to utilise carbohydrates other than hmos. we also provide evidence that indicates that b. longum subsp. infantis 157 f and b. longum subsp. infantis ccug  <dig> should be assigned to the longum subspecies  <cit> . finally, comparative analysis of b. longum highlights the versatility of this species and its ability to move with us from infancy to adulthood.

the genetic inaccessibility of bifidobacteria hinders the exploration of the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for its acclaimed probiotic activities. improvement of transformation efficiency has previously been achieved by overcoming r-m systems  <cit> . the negative impact of r-m systems on transformation efficiency of bifidobacteria has been demonstrated in b. breve ucc <dig>  <cit> , b. adolescentis atcc  <dig>  <cit>  and b. bifidum s <dig>  <cit> . however, such an r-m barrier can be overcome by the appropriate pre-methylation of plasmid dna  <cit> .

by exploiting our knowledge of the active r-m systems harboured by b. longum subsp. longum ncimb  <dig>  we successfully generated a mutant of this strain via homologous recombination. the mutant strain b. longum subsp. longum ncimb 8809-arfb revealed that arfb plays a vital role in arabinoxylan degradation.
