BACKGROUND
the host innate immune system recognizes various pathogen-associated molecular patterns  and danger-associated molecular patterns  through pattern-recognition receptors  and triggers the inflammatory response to defense against microorganisms invasion  <cit> . there are three classes of prrs in vertebrates, toll-like receptors , nucleotide-binding oligomerization -like receptors , and the retinoid acid-inducible gene-i -like receptors   <cit> . these molecules showed different subcellular localization, for example, most tlrs identify extracellular pamps, whereas nlrs and rlrs sense intracellular pamps  <cit> . recently, the nlrs have gained attention because of their involvement in mediating innate immune responses to microbial invasion and controlling innate immune pathways. to date, at least  <dig> members of the nlr family have been identified in humans  <cit> , and some of them have been well characterized. for example, two members of the nlrc ) family, nlrc <dig> and nlrc <dig>  recognize bacteria-derived molecules and result in activation of downstream signaling pathways, including nf-kb and mitogen-activated protein kinase s, to induce production of inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . nlrp <dig> and nlrp <dig>  play key roles in activating caspase- <dig> inflammasomes as a response to pamps and damps, leading to maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin -1b and il- <dig>  <cit> . in addition, nlrc <dig>  nlrc <dig>  nlrp <dig>  nlrp <dig>  and mhc class ii transactivator  are all associated with susceptibility to chronic inflammatory diseases  <cit> .

recently, nlrc <dig>  a newly identified member of nlr family, with the most evolutionary relationship to nlrc <dig> and nlrc <dig>  <cit> , has been implicated in regulation of the innate immune response  <cit> . nlrc <dig> is highly expressed in lymphocytic and macrophage/monocytic cell lineages  <cit>  and immune tissues  <cit> . nlrc <dig> can be potently induced by interferon gamma  and modestly induced by the microbial-derived molecules, lipopolysaccharide  and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid )  <cit> . the specific role of nlrc <dig> in acting as a regulator of proinflammatory pathways is controversial  <cit> . nlrc <dig> is suggested to positively regulate the interferon  pathway in human cervical carcinoma helas <dig> cells and human acute monocytic cell line, thp- <dig>  <cit> . overexpression of nlrc <dig> leads to the activation of ifn-specific response elements  in hela cells  <cit> . sirna-mediated knockdown of endogenous nlrc <dig> decreased type i ifn pathway-dependent responses mediated by sendai virus and poly  in thp- <dig> cells  <cit> . in contrast, overexpression of nlrc <dig> was shown to repress the activation of nf-kb-, type i ifn-, and ap-1-dependent signaling pathways in human embryonic kidney cell line hek293t, and the knockdown of nlrc <dig> increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in mouse leukaemic monocyte macrophage cell line, raw <dig>   <cit> . moreover, cui et al. demonstrated that nlrc <dig> negatively modulated nf-kb and type i ifn signaling pathways and its absence resulted in elevated expression levels of tumor necrosis factor  a, il- <dig>  and il-1b  <cit> . in addition, opposite effects have also been described for the role of nlrc <dig> as a transcriptional regulator of mhc class i expression. it binds to the mhc class i promoter and up-regulates mhc class i expression in lymphoid and epithelial cell lines. nlrc <dig> was also proven to be required in the pathway of efficient induction of mhc class i by ifng stimulation  <cit> . in contrast, knockdown of nlrc <dig> was shown to increase cell surface expression of mhc class i in raw  <dig>  cells, which indicated a negative role of nlrc <dig> in regulating mhc class i expression  <cit> . therefore, the effects of nlrc <dig> in regulating immune-related components and inflammatory responsive pathways are very complex, and likely either cell type- or species-specific  <cit> .

to date, no study on the functional role of nlrc <dig> in chickens has been reported. in the current study, we characterized the functions of nlrc <dig> gene in the regulation of ifna, ifnb, il- <dig>  and mhc class i by utilizing rna-interference technology and stimulation with lps from salmonella typhimurium or poly  in the chicken hd <dig> macrophage cell line. these specific ligands were selected to complement and expand upon our previously published studies  <cit> . the expression levels, over time, for five genes were determined by qpcr to elucidate the association of nlrc <dig> with ifna, ifnb, il- <dig>  and mhc class i. the present study reports the initial characterization of chicken nlrc <dig> and its roles in the regulation of innate immune response to bacterial components. our findings are novel and of significant scientific value for a better understanding of host response to infectious diseases in chickens.

RESULTS
expression of nlrc <dig>  ifna, ifnb, and il- <dig> in negative irrelevant sirna transfection controls was up-regulated at  <dig> hours post lps stimulation
the expression of nlrc <dig>  ifna, ifnb, and il- <dig> was significantly up-regulated, and mhc class i showed an increasing trend, in lps-treated hd <dig> cells compared to vehicle controls at  <dig> hours post stimulation  . the expression of nlrc <dig> and ifna after lps treatment at  <dig> hps was higher than  <dig> and  <dig> hps . ifnb and il- <dig> genes expression at  <dig> hours post lps stimulation was higher than  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hps . mhc class i gene expression was also higher at  <dig> hours post lps treatment than these at  <dig> and  <dig> hours . however, poly  had no effect on gene expression, based upon lack of significant difference between the poly  treated group and non-poly -treated controls at any time points in negative sirna transfected cells , which may be because of miscalculation in the dilution of the stock resulting in the low concentration of poly  used.

lps and poly , as agonists of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  respectively, have been extensively used to mimic bacterial and viral infection to induce inflammation in host innate immune response studies. in mammals, lps is recognized by lps-binding protein  <dig> and transferred to another lps binding protein cd <dig>  which delivers the lps to a complex of myeloid differentiation protein- <dig>  and tlr <dig>  <cit> . the tlr4/md-2/cd <dig> complex transduces the lps signal through the recruitment of various adaptor molecules at the toll/il-1r  domain of the tlr <dig> receptor, and triggers downstream signaling events, such as activation of nuclear factors, nf-kb and ap- <dig>  and subsequent production of proinflammatory cytokines and interferons  <cit> . two predominant intracellular pathways, the myd88-dependent and independent pathways are activated by tlr agonists to induce inflammatory responses  <cit> . the myd88-dependent pathway utilizes myd <dig> and tirap and results in activation of nf-kb and production of the responsive immunoregulatory molecules, such as il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnf, and ifng  <cit> . myd88-independent pathway, also called the tram/trif-dependent pathway, induces phosphorylation of ifn regulatory factor  <dig> and the subsequent production of type i ifns as well as a delayed nf-kb response  <cit> . tlr <dig> is an unique member of tlr family, which activates both the myd88-dependent and the independent pathways  <cit> . however, tlr <dig>  the sensor of poly , exclusively triggers the myd88-independent pathway, leading to production of inflammatory cytokines such as tnf, il- <dig>  and ifnb  <cit> .

keestra et al. recently reported that a functional lps-induced myd88-independent pathway is absent in chicken, based upon their observation of no change of ifnb gene expression after lps treatment  or salmonella gallinarum -lps) in chicken cells  <cit> . interestingly, conflicting results were obtained in the current study, as well as in research recently reported by esnault et al.  <cit> . use of different sources and doses of lps may partly explain the conflicting results among the studies. in the current study, gene expression of ifna, ifnb, and il- <dig> was up-regulated after salmonella typhimurium -lps treatment  at  <dig> hps. these results indicate that lps stimulation induced elevated expression of type i ifn genes  and also an nf-kb-reponsive gene . similar results were reported by esnault et al.  <cit> , who found that the expression of ifna, ifnb and il- <dig> was strongly up-regulated in chicken epithelial cell line  after e. coli -lps  stimulation between  <dig> hps and  <dig> hps. collectively, these studies suggest that specific gene expression patterns after lps stimulation are dependent upon the distinct lps sources and dosage.

additionally, in the present study, lps treatment up-regulated the expression of the nlrc <dig> gene in chicken hd <dig> macrophage cells at  <dig> hps. although lps and poly  are considered to be moderate regulators of nlrc <dig>  the reported effects seem to be varied and dependent upon the cell type tested. for example, in mouse splenic b lymphocytes, lps induced a moderate increase in nlrc <dig> expression compared with ifng, which is a strong regulator of nlrc <dig>  <cit> . but in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages , lps simulation did not alter nlrc <dig> mrna expression, whereas, poly  treatment increased its expression  <cit> . in raw  <dig>  cells, lps stimulation up-regulated nlrc <dig> at mrna and protein levels, peaked at  <dig> hours post treatment, while only a weak increase of nlrc <dig> was observed after poly  stimulation  <cit> .

s3-sirna knocked down nlrc <dig> expression, and ifna and ifnb were down-regulated in s3-sirna transfected cells
to further investigate the roles of nlrc <dig> in regulating expression of type i ifns and nf-kb responsive genes in chickens, we utilized rna interference to knock down nlrc <dig> expression, and then treated cells with lps or poly , as well as a vehicle control. the gene expression of type i ifns , an nf-kb responsive gene , and also an antigen presentation molecule  was quantified by qpcr. of three sirnas designed, only s3-sirna down-regulated the expression of nlrc <dig> compared to negative irrelevant sirna. nlrc <dig> expression was reduced by 65% at  <dig> hps  with a transfection efficiency 75%. interestingly, ifna and ifnb exhibited down-regulated expression patterns consistent with that of nlrc <dig> in s3-sirna transfected cells . although gene expression of nlrc <dig>  ifna, and ifnb in the s3-sirna lps treatment group is not significantly higher than that in s3-sirna vehicle control group , their gene expression has numerically higher values in the s3-sirna lps group , and it appeared that the gene expression decrease is relatively alleviated after lps treatment. these results indicated that knockdown of nlrc <dig> negatively modulated gene expression of ifna and ifnb in chicken hd <dig> cells. there was no significant change in il- <dig> and mhc class i gene expression in nlrc <dig> knocked-down cells.

nlrc <dig> is a highly conserved member of the nlr family and has been reported to be involved in type i ifn and nf-kb signaling pathways, as well as regulating mhc class i  <cit> . however, the specific role of nlrc <dig> in regulating inflammatory immune response remains unsolved  <cit> . cui et al. showed that nlrc <dig> is a negative modulator of nf-kb and the type i ifn pathways. nlrc <dig> potently inhibited the nf-kb pathway through blocking phosphorylation of two subunits of ikk complex, ikka and ikkb. it also repressed rlr-mediated type i ifn response by interaction with rig-i and mda <dig>  <cit> . similar results have been reported that nlrc <dig> overexpression resulted in down-regulation of nf-kb and isre in the type i ifn-dependent pathway in hek293t cells  <cit> . nlrc <dig> knockdown in raw <dig>  cells induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tnf, il- <dig>  and il-1b  <cit> . in contrast, kuenzel et al. reported that overexpression of nlrc <dig> in epithelial cells induced greater mrna levels of ifna, prkrir, and oas <dig>  <cit> . sirna-mediated knockdown of nlrc <dig> significantly impaired induction of ifna in human foreskin fibroblasts cells  after cytomegalovirus  infection  <cit> , which indicates nlrc <dig> functions as a positive regulator of type i ifn. the same conclusion was proposed by neerincx et al.  <cit> , who showed that nlrc <dig> knockdown reduced the secretion of ifnb in thp- <dig> cells infected with sendai virus, which predominately induces type i ifns  <cit> . however, in the same study, overexpression of nlrc <dig> failed to induce nf-kb, ifnb, irf <dig>  irf <dig>  and isre in hek293t cells, which revealed that impact of nlrc <dig> on downstream pathways might depend on the specific cell type examined. cell-specificity of response was also supported by kumar et al.  <cit> , who reported that there was no difference in expression of ifnb, il- <dig>  and ifna between wild type  and nlrc5-deficient mice after infection with rna viruses, dna virus, and bacteria in macrophages and dendritic cells. expression levels of tnfa, il- <dig>  and ccl <dig> in gm-csf-induced bone marrow dendritic cells  after lps treatment were not different between nlrc5-deficient and wt mouse. the authors suggested that nlrc <dig> may be not necessary for induction of inflammatory cytokines under physiologic conditions after viral and bacterial infections  <cit> . the roles of nlrc <dig> in inflammatory responsive pathways appear to depend on the cell types or specific species  <cit> . in the present study, expression of ifna and ifnb was down-regulated in nlrc <dig> knocked-down hd <dig> cells. these results suggest that nlrc <dig> positively regulates type i ifns in the chicken hd <dig> macrophage cell line. in addition, nlrc <dig> has been shown to regulate mhc class i gene expression, but reports on the direction of gene regulation are controversial. nlrc <dig> was reported to positively regulate the expression of mhc class i gene through binding to the promoter region of mhc class i in lymphoid and epithelial cell lines  <cit> . however, a conflicting effect was observed in raw  <dig>  cells, where knockdown of nlrc <dig> increased expression of mhc class i on cell surface  <cit> . in the present study, we detected expression of mhc class i, but there was no significant difference between nlrc <dig> knocked-down hd <dig> cells and controls, regardless of lps or poly  treatment. these results indicate that nlrc <dig> is not a major regulator of mhc class i in chicken macrophages.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study reporting the role of nlrc <dig> in regulating type i ifns , an nf-kb responsive gene , and antigen presenting pathway gene  in the chicken. the expression of both ifna and ifnb was down-regulated in nlrc <dig> knocked-down cells, and their expression was relatively restored by lps treatment . the consistent expression patterns between nlrc <dig> and ifna and ifnb indicates that nlrc <dig> is a positive modulator in type i ifn pathway in chicken. in addition, we found that st-lps treatment could induce ifnb expression in the chicken hd <dig> macrophage cell line, although a functional lps-specific myd88-independent pathway is reportedly absent in chickens. stimulation with lps from different sources and doses may be responsible for differing reports on induction of ifnb expression.
