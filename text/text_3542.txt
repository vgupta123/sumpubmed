BACKGROUND
boesenbergia rotunda  mansfield, kulturpflanze is a synonym of gastrochilus panduratum ridley, boesenbergia pandurata , kaempferia pandurata roxb. and gastrochilus panduratus  ridl. and is believed to have originated from the indian, southern china and southeast asia regions . it is a traditional medicinal plant known locally in malaysia and indonesia as temu kunci, merkunci, dekunci or temu kecil  <cit> , in thailand as kra-chai  <cit> , in china as chinese ginger or chinese keys, while its english name is finger root ginger.

boesenbergia rotunda  is a perennial herb belonging to the zingiberaceae family. it is a small herbaceous plant with short, slender rhizomes  <cit> . the rhizomes are widely used in southeast asia as an edible spice or vegetable and in ethnomedicine as an ingredient for the treatment of aphthous ulcers, dry mouth, stomach discomforts, leucorrhoea, dysentery, inflammation, rheumatism and muscular pains  <cit> . traditionally, their rhizomes are eaten raw to treat mouth ulcers  <cit>  or prepared together with other medicinal plant rhizomes as a tonic for post-natal treatment to restore blood circulation and to rejuvenate the body  <cit> . crushed rhizomes are used externally to release stomach gas, improve appetite, improve digestion and treat rheumatism  <cit> .

the major bioactive constituents in boesenbergia rotunda are flavonoids. to date, more than  <dig> flavonoids have been isolated from boesenbergia rotunda and are classified into two main groups, flavanones and chalcones. based on their flavonoid carbon skeleton structure, compounds that can be classified as flavanones include pinocembrin, pinostrobin, alpinetin, rotundaflavone i and rotundaflavone ii, while cardamonin, 4-hydroxypanduratin a, panduratin a, isopanduratin a, boesenbergin a, krachaizin a and krachaizin b are classified as chalcones . among isolated secondary metabolites from boesenbergia rotunda, panduratin a has been shown to possess various medicinal properties which include anti-dengue, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-hiv- <dig> protease, antibacterial, anti-aging, antioxidant and anti-obesity properties .

panduratin a and 4-hydroxypanduratin a were reported to exhibit stronger biological activities compared to other secondary metabolites in boesenbergia rotunda <cit> . in a previous study, panduratin a has been shown to have anti-dengue properties through inhibition of dengue- <dig> virus ns <dig> protease which eventually leads to the termination of viral replication  <cit> . dengue is a fast emerging pandemic viral disease in tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide  <cit> . the world health organization  reported that  <dig>  billion people or about 40% of the world population, are now at risk of dengue with an estimated  <dig> –  <dig> million dengue infections worldwide annually  <cit> . severe dengue or formally known as dengue haemorrhagic fever has become leading cause of hospitalization and death. the who estimates that about  <dig>  <dig> people are infected with severe dengue each year with  <dig> % mortality  <cit> . to date there are no licensed dengue treatments while the frequency of dengue outbreaks are increasing each year  <cit> .

despite the extensive reports on the potential use of panduratin a, the limited amounts of panduratin a that can be extracted from their natural source has resulted in unmet market demands when up-scaled quantities are required. harvesting of mature rhizomes require almost a one year planting cycle for boesenbergia rotunda. in addition, extraction of panduratin a from  <dig> kilograms of dried boesenbergia rotunda rhizome using a solvent extraction method only yields approximately  <dig>  mg of panduratin a  <cit> . although chemically synthesized panduratin a has been reported, the economics of the procedures continues to hinder large-scale production of panduratin a  <cit> . alternatively the enhancement of panduratin a production through genetic manipulation of its secondary metabolic pathways is a potential strategy for panduratin a yield improvement and this would require knowledge of its biosynthetic pathway which at present remains unclear.

panduratin a production has been shown in a published report from this laboratory to be enhanced by the addition of exogenous phenylalanine into boesenbergia rotunda cell suspension cultures  <cit> . phenylalanine is an aromatic amino acid produced from the shikimic acid pathway  <cit> . it provides the essential 6-carbon ring and 3-carbon side chain that is central to all phenylpropanoids. phenylalanine is also the precursor for the production of cinnamic acid, the first phenylpropanoids in the phenylpropanoid pathway, which are eventually channelled into the production of most flavonoids in plants including panduratin a.

for elucidation of the genes that are involved in the panduratin a biosynthetic pathway, we have sequenced, and compared two sets of transcriptome profiles that were derived from phenylalanine treated and untreated  boesenbergia rotunda cell suspension cultures. de novo transcriptome of boesenbergia rotunda was done by combining both transcripts from control and treated samples to generate longer sequences. subsequently, gene regulation patterns between the control and phenylalanine treated cell suspension cultures were analysed using dge analysis by mapping both transcriptome profiles to the de novo transcriptome database. the focus of the research was to resolve the gene regulation patterns in the phenylpropanoid pathway that leads to panduratin a biosynthesis in boesenbergia rotunda cell suspension cultures in response to exogenous phenylalanine. additionally the de novo transcriptome data would also enrich the plant database and eventually serve as reference sequences for other zingiberaceae family plant species.

RESULTS
short –read de novosequencing and assembly
rna samples were extracted from control and phenylalanine treated boesenbergia rotunda callus using a modified ctab method  <cit> . illumina-solexa rna sequencing technology was used to sequence the whole transcriptome of boesenbergia rotunda. after stringent data filtering and quality checks, approximately  <dig> million high-quality clean reads were obtained from both samples with  <dig> % and  <dig> % q <dig> bases  for control and treated sample respectively. in total, there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> clean paired-end reads generated with a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> nucleotides from control boesenbergia rotunda callus and phenylalanine treated callus respectively .table  <dig>

n <dig> size of contigs, scaffolds or unigene was calculated by ordering all sequences then adding the lengths from longest to shortest until the summed length exceeded 50% of the total length of all sequences.



clean reads that were generated from the illumina genome analyzer were assembled into contigs, scaffolds and unigenes using open source soap denovo assembler program  <cit> . a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> contigs with lengths ranging between  <dig> – 5680 bp and  <dig> – 3739 bp with n <dig> lengths of  <dig> and  <dig>  for control and phenylalanine treated samples respectively. contigs were then overlapped using paired-end read information to assemble into scaffolds. there were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> scaffolds assembled from the control and treated samples with average scaffold sizes of  <dig>  and  <dig> . scaffolds from both samples lengths ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  211 bp for the control and from  <dig> to  <dig>  943 bp for the treated sample.

subsequently, scaffolds were overlapped and paired-end reads were used to fill the scaffold gaps to obtain unigenes. for the control sample, there were  <dig>   <dig> unigenes assembled with lengths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  209 bp and a n <dig> length of 703 bp; while for the treated sample, there were  <dig>   <dig> unigenes assembled with lengths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  944 bp with a n <dig> length of 610 bp. finally, longer sequences denoted as all unigenes, were assembled by overlapping both control and phenylalanine treated unigenes followed by removing redundant sequences using tgicl software. there were in total approximately  <dig>   <dig> all unigenes assembled with lengths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  209 bp. the n <dig> lengths of all unigenes were 804 bp. additional file  <dig> shows the length distribution, while additional file  <dig> shows gap distribution of the control unigene, phenylalanine treated unigene and all unigenes respectively.

in order to determine the unigenes’ sequence orientation, all unigenes were aligned using blastx alignment  against four protein databases with the priority order of genbank non-redundant , swiss-prot, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  and clusters of orthologous groups . remaining unaligned unigenes were analyzed using estscan software  <cit>  to predict the coding regions and to decide on sequence direction. the best-aligned results showed that  <dig>   <dig> unigenes are oriented while  <dig>   <dig> are non-oriented unigenes .

the most abundant degs were classified in the metabolism category with  <dig>  unigenes , followed by genetic information processing , organismal systems , cellular processes  and environmental information processing . there were ten sub-categories found under the metabolism category . in the metabolism category, most of the degs were found in the carbohydrate metabolism sub-category , followed by metabolism of terpenoid and polyketides , metabolism of other amino acid , energy metabolism  and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites . unigenes that were annotated in the metabolism category were involved in functions related to catalysis of metabolism processes or generation of energy for primary and secondary metabolite production.

under the carbohydrate metabolism sub-category, there were six pathways that had a calculated q value ≤  <dig>  . the pathway in this sub-category with the smallest q value was the citrate cycle pathway with  <dig> degs, followed by galactose metabolism , glycolysis/gluconeogenesis , amino sugar and nueleotide sugar metabolism , pyruvate metabolism  and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism . subsequently, for the energy metabolism sub-category, there was only one pathway identified which was for nitrogen metabolism with  <dig> degs. there were three pathways with q value lower than  <dig>  in the amino acid metabolism sub-category, which included phenylalanine metabolism , alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism  and valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis . two secondary metabolite pathways with q values lower than  <dig>  were identified as terpenoid backbone biosynthesis  and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis . based on the histogram in figure  <dig>  there were  <dig> unigenes up-regulated and  <dig> unigenes down-regulated. the highest number of up-regulated unigenes was peroxidase with  <dig> unigenes, while the highest down-regulated unigene was beta-glucosidase with  <dig> unigenes.figure  <dig>

panduratin a is a chalcone derivative that is proposed to be derived from the flavonoid pathway . phenylalanine is an aromatic amino acid that is produced in the shikimic acid pathway  <cit>  and enters the phenylpropanoid pathway as an initial substrate to produce all phenylpropanoids including flavonoids . it provides the essential 6-carbon ring and 3-carbon side chain that is central to all phenylpropanoids and subsequently enters the flavonoid pathway to produce major flavonoid groups such as chalcones, flavanones, flavones, flavan-4-ols, flavan-3-ols, flavanols, isoflavones and anthocyanins .

an overview of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway leading to the synthesis of major flavonoid groups and the proposed panduratin a biosynthesis is shown in figure  <dig>  initially, phenylalanine is deaminated by phenylalanine ammonia lyase  to produce first the phenylpropanoid acid, cinnamic acid. then, cinnamic acid was either converted to cinnamoyl-coa by 4-coumaroyl:coenzyme a ligase  or converted to p-coumaric acid by a p <dig> cytochrome monoxygenase enzyme, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase . this was the first branching in the phenylpropanoid pathway. subsequently, p-coumaric acid is also converted to phenolic coa thioesters catalyzed by 4cl through attachment of coa to a phenolic compound, producing p-coumaroyl-coa.figure  <dig>

both phenolic coa thioesters enter the flavonoid pathway and produce chalcones, which is the first flavonoid major group, by condensation of three acetate extender molecules from malonyl-coa. the enzyme that is responsible for this reaction is chalcone synthase , a type iii polyketide synthase  <cit> . once produced, chalcones serve as the precursors for all of the various groups of flavonoids. next, chalcone isomerase  converts chalcone into flavanone by isomerization. flavanones are important intermediates, as they are involved in producing several other major flavonoid groups.

there are four major ways of producing various flavonoid groups by modifications of flavanones. firstly, flavanones may be dehydrated to produce flavones by flavone synthase  <dig>  and  <dig> . secondly, flavanones may also be further isomerized to form isoflavones by isoflavone synthase  in some plants, which are subsequently used to synthesize isoflavonoids. thirdly, reduction reactions catalyzed by dihydroflavonol 4-reductase  converting flavanones to flavan-4-ols, which serves as precursors to produce phlobaphene polymers. lastly, flavanones may form dihydroflavonols by hydroxylation catalyzed by flavanone-3-hydroxylase . dihydroflavonols are further converted to flavanols by a desaturation reaction catalyzed by flavonol synthase .

dihydroflavonols are precursors for anthocyanin pigments synthesis which upon synthesis is reduced to leucoanthocyanidins by dihydroflavonol 4-reductase  and converted to anthocyanidins by anthocyanidin synthase . finally, anthocyanins are synthesized from anthocyanidins through further modifications. leucoanthocyanidins and anthocyanidins are reduced to form flavan-3-ols by leucoanthocyanidin reductase  and anthocyanidin reductase  respectively which then serve as polymers producing proanthocyanidins.

figure  <dig> shows the regulation patterns of unigenes that were mapped to the main enzymes in the flavonoid pathway. only pal, c4h, 4cl, chs, chi, f3h, fls, dfr, ans and lar were mapped to the boesenbergia rotunda transcriptome unigenes. however, no gene regulation was detected for chi . in contrast, no unigene matched for fs1/fs <dig> and anr . additionally, the isoflavone biosynthetic pathway map was not present in the boesenbergia rotunda system. in total, there were  <dig> unigenes mapped to pal but only  <dig> of them showed up-regulation while  <dig> were down-regulated . out of  <dig> unigenes assigned as c4h, only  <dig> unigene was up-regulated and the other  <dig> unigenes were down-regulated. the most abundant unigene was assigned as 4cl with  <dig> unigenes. however, only  <dig> were up-regulated, while  <dig> others were down-regulated. a further  <dig> unigenes were assigned as chs but only one unigene was up-regulated while  <dig> were down-regulated during production of chalcones in the flavonoid pathway. there was no gene regulation pattern observed during flavanone production from chalcones by chi. a non-enzymatic reaction is suggested to be involved in this step. subsequently, only two f3h and five fls unigenes were up-regulated to form flavonols from flavanones. in contrast, there were four down-regulated dfr, three up-regulated ans and one down-regulated lar unigenes involved in anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin production.table  <dig>

discussion
digital gene expression  analysis for elucidating differentially expressed genes  is an approach that can be used to further understand the nature of a plant’s response towards various stimuli or stresses  <cit> . for medicinal plants, rna-seq together with degs data has been used to identify genes that are directly or indirectly involved in the biosynthetic pathways of target bioactive compounds. thus far, cytochrome p <dig>  had been identified in most reported analysis of late terpenoid pathways. the combination of rna-seq technology and methyl jasmonate induction experiments successfully identified one cyp <dig> and four glycosyltransferases as key enzymes in the ginsenoside biosynthesis in panax quinquefolius <cit> . subsequently, by combining rna-seq technology and phylogenetic tree analysis based on the previously identified cyp <dig> and glycosyltransferase in panax quinquefolius, two cyp <dig> and one udp-glycosyltransferase were also elucidated as candidates for ginsenoside biosynthesis in panax notoginseng <cit> . additionally, seven cyp <dig> and five glucosyltransferase were identified in mogrosides biosynthesis in siraitia grosvenorri; and six cyp <dig> and one glucosidase identified in camptothecin biosynthesis in camtotheca acuminate <cit> . additionally, rnaseq analysis from different rhizomes of cultivated curcuma longa cultivars in india described transcripts potentially related to anticancer and antimalarial terpenoids  <cit> .

this strategy was also used to elucidate the candidate genes that might be involved in the panduratin a biosynthesis through sequencing of the whole transcriptome of untreated and phenylalanine treated cell suspension cultures of boesenbergia rotunda and analysis of the gene expression patterns involved in the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathways. in total, there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> reads that were successfully generated from control and phenylalanine treated boesenbergia rotunda respectively using an illumina-solexa sequencer . using soapdenovo software, these unigenes were overlapped and assembled to form longer sequences from short reads to contigs, scaffolds and unigenes, which resulted in  <dig>   <dig> boesenbergia rotunda unigenes successfully assembled. however, only  <dig> % unigenes were successfully annotated in the public protein databases with  <dig> % in nr, followed by  <dig> % in swiss-prot,  <dig> % in kegg and  <dig> % in cog . the limited numbers of identified plant genes and their deposition in the database might be the reason for the unannotated  <dig> % of the transcriptome unigenes. these unannotated unigenes should be further identified to enrich public plant databases.

in future, further study using mutant yeast complementation experiments will be conducted to determine the unigene functions. this complementary experimental approach is based on employing the specific mutant yeast that cannot grow on certain media composition. however, mutant yeast harbouring the gene of interest could grow on the selectable media due to their ability to restore the physical deficiency of the mutated yeast , in which consequently indirectly verify their gene function. the functional complementary approach using mutant yeast has successfully elucidated genes in arabidopsis thaliana such as isopenthyl diphosphate isomerase encoded by the ipp gene, methyltransferase encoded by the coq <dig> gene, phosphor-ethanilamine n-methyltransferase and acetylornithine aminotransferase encoded by the tup <dig> gene . the same approach has also elucidated iron transporter gene function  in malus xiaojinesis <cit> .

phenylalanine was chosen as an exogenous precursor to increase panduratin a production in boesenbergia rotunda cell suspension culture at fourteen-days post treatment with phenylalanine  <cit> . the strategy was based on increasing the key compound within the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway that would induce or increase the yield of the final product. the addition of phenylalanine was also reported to stimulate taxol production in taxus cupidata cell suspension culture  <cit> .

differential expression patterns of transcriptome profile between control and phenylalanine treated boesenbergia rotunda cell suspension culture showed  <dig>   <dig> significantly up-regulated and  <dig>   <dig> significantly down-regulated unigenes with fdr ≤  <dig>  and |log2ratio| ≥ <dig> . the key factor of differential gene expression in boesenbergia rotunda cell suspension culture between control and phenylalanine treated is proposed to be related to the differential expression of transcription factors and transcription regulators. transcription factors are regulatory proteins that control the expression of specific groups of genes through sequence-specific dna binding and protein-protein interactions. they act either as activators or repressors of gene expression, mediating either an increase or decrease in the accumulation of mrna depending on tissue type or in response to internal or external signals  <cit> . both transcription factors and transcription regulators in the phenylalanine treated samples were initially regulated by the addition of phenylalanine and appear to result in regulation of other genes.

there were in total  <dig> transcription factors and  <dig> transcription regulators found in boesenbergia rotunda in this study. the classification of both transcription factors and regulators were carried out by homology blastx search against the rice database using itak software. the most abundant transcription factor found was classified under the c3h family. the second most abundant transcription factor found was myb followed by nac, wrky, bzip and ap2-erebp family . all of these transcription factor families except for ch <dig> showed significant differential expression of their members in the treated sample , suggesting that they played an important role in the induction or repression of the panduratin a biosynthesis pathway.

it was reported that plant r2r <dig> myb transcription factor contain two helix-turn-helix motifs responsible for binding to target genes  <cit> . the r2r <dig> myb family plays a major role in regulating sets of genes that are responsible for secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways in plants especially for synthesizing flavonoids in the phenylpropanoid pathway  <cit> . similarly it was apparent that myb transcription factors were affected in this study. although only one myb gene was up-regulated, the remaining four were down-regulated and were possibly responsible for down regulating or switching off sets of genes that were not related to the panduratin a biosynthetic pathway. other up-regulated transcription factors such as ap2-erebp, wrky, bzip, gras and nac haves been reported to modulate the genes for plant growth and plant response to biotic or abiotic stresses . this information would be useful for future analysis on genes that are regulated by these transcription factors especially in relation to phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathways.

the addition of exogenous phenylalanine in the liquid media of treated cell suspension culture helps to elucidate genes that might be directly or indirectly responsible for panduratin a biosynthesis. the most abundant up-regulated unigenes in the phenylpropanoid pathway were peroxidase, with  <dig> out of  <dig> unigenes . peroxidase is classified as a class iii plant peroxidase that catalyzes plant-specific oxidoreduction between hydrogen peroxide  and various reductants  <cit> . differential expression profile of the peroxidase as isoenzymes in boesenbergia rotunda suggests that they might be involved in catalyzing different substrate and may be involved in different physiological processes. peroxidase class iii is involved in lignification in higher plants by radical coupling of monolignols  <cit> . this oxidoreduction reaction utilizes hydrogen peroxide  for oxidative power to produce monolignol radicals for lignin polymerization  <cit> . different monolignols in this reaction produces different types of lignin and thus provide different resistance barriers for plants. lignin provides mechanical strength and resistance against pathogens in plants. lignification is a normal process for plant growth and development and also occurs in response to environmental stresses  <cit> . additionally, some peroxidase isoenzymes were regulated upon environmental stimuli or prior attack by pathogens, which render the plant with self-defense mechanism against physical, chemical and biological stresses  <cit> .

most primary metabolic processes such as carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism have more down-regulated unigenes compared to up-regulated unigenes in the same pathway  . primary metabolism is essential for plant growth, plant development and plant reproduction. in cell suspension cultures, primary metabolism is essential for plant cells to propagate in liquid media. down-regulation of unigenes in the primary metabolic pathways after 14 days of propagation might be due to depleted nutrients in the liquid media. it can be suggested that by depleting plant nutrients, cell suspension cultures are stressed and eventually induces secondary metabolites. similar observations were reported by lattanzio et. al. who showed that under limited nutrient conditions, increased phenolic compounds was observed with a decrease in biomass production  <cit> .

there are several hypotheses that relates the carbon limiting step in primary metabolism to secondary metabolite production in plants as a trade-off between growth and the production of carbon-based secondary metabolites such as phenolic compounds  <cit> . the carbon-nutrient hypothesis  suggests that plants modify the allocation of carbon skeletons between primary and secondary metabolism, where in a nutrient depletion situation, the plant restricts growth and the carbon skeleton is allocated to produce phenolic secondary metabolite compounds  <cit> . in addition, the protein competition model of phenolic allocation by jones and hartley,  <dig> suggests that protein and phenolic synthesis are competing for the use of phenylalanine as a precursor  <cit> . therefore, the availability of phenylalanine for phenolic compound biosynthesis is affected by any environmental changes that affect plant growth and protein synthesis.

in order to validate the transcriptome data, qpcr validation was done using a random selection of unigenes and included some of the unigenes that were annotated from the flavonoid pathway. this included pal; unigen10327_all, c4h; unigene67845_all, 4cl; unigene41852_all, chs; unigene1735_all and f3h; unigene49558_all .

figure  <dig> shows the proposed panduratin a biosynthetic pathway, which is derived from chalcones in the flavonoid pathway. through rna-seq and differentially expressed genes analysis, genes that are potentially involved in panduratin a synthesis were identified . from the results, it can be inferred that the isoflavanoids biosynthetic pathway may not be present in boesenbergia rotunda as the pathway map was not found in the kegg results. additionally, there was no unigene mapped to flavone synthase , suggesting that flavones were not produced in the boesenbergia rotunda cell suspension culture. however, in contrast , flavones were successfully isolated and identified in black rhizome of boesenbergia pandurata <cit> . tuchinda et. al. , reported that boesenbergia pandurata which is boesenbergia rotunda’s synonym has four rhizome varieties including yellow, black, white and red rhizomes  <cit> . from the transcriptome data, it could be suggested that different rhizomes varieties may have different flavonoid biosynthesis pathways as the source of cell suspension culture in this study originated from yellow rhizomes and this would merit further investigation. the other enzyme that had no unigene mapped to it was anthocyanine reductase , which converts anthocyanidins to flavan-3-ols, which eventually polymerizes to form proanthocyanidins.

the other enzymes in the flavonoid pathway consist of both up- and down-regulated unigenes except for chalcone isomerase , dihydroflavonol-4-reductase  and leucoanthocyanidin reductase  . there were no significant gene regulation patterns in chi, whereas down-regulated unigenes were identified for both dfr and lar . most of unigenes that were mapped to the remaining flavonoid enzymes such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase , cinnamate-4-hydroxylase , 4-coumaroyl:coenzyme a ligase , chalcone synthase , flavanone-3-hydroxylase , flavonol synthase  and anthocyanin synthase  were down-regulated. it is suggested that down-regulation of enzymes isomers in the flavonoid pathway causes switch-off of competitive pathways and eventually divertion of the metabolic flux to the production of the desired secondary metabolites.

there were three enzymes known to be directly involved in panduratin a production, pal, 4cl and chs   <cit> . all of these enzymes are known to be encoded by a multi-gene family. phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  catalyzes the first step in phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway. in many plant species, several copies of the pal gene have been found and characterized. between  <dig> to  <dig> pal genes have been identified in arabidopsis, tobacco, bean and parsley . more than  <dig> pal genes were identified in potato  <cit> . although more than one pal gene is present in each plant species, the regulation of each pal gene depends on different response of stimuli  <cit> . in this study, there were  <dig> unigenes that were mapped as pal. however, only  <dig> unigenes were up-regulated in response to the addition of phenylalanine.

a second enzyme 4cl, showed a gene regulation pattern directly involved in the panduratin a production. there were in total  <dig> unigenes mapped as 4cl in boesenbergia rotunda. however, only  <dig> unigenes were up-regulated and  <dig> unigenes down-regulated after 14 days post treatment with phenylalanine. 4cl can be divided into two types in arabidopsis thaliana; type i is responsible for lignin formation and type ii leads to branching of the flavonoid pathways to produce flower pigments and defence mechanisms  <cit> . however, in rice, other than type i 4cl cluster, none were clustered in type ii, but instead clustered separately in type iii  <cit> . although type i 4cl in dicots and type iii 4cl in monocots are suggested to lead to lignin formation, they differ in sequences and substrate preference  <cit> . similarly for type ii 4cl, which also have differences in substrate preference and eventually causes branching in flavonoid biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . hence it could be suggested that the remaining non-regulated 4cl in boesenbergia rotunda might also be involved in lignin formation or possess different substrates preference.

chalcone synthase  is categorized under the type iii polyketide synthases superfamily  <cit> . it catalyzes the formation of chalcones by condensing one p-coumaroyl-coa and three malonyl-coa  <cit> . different combination of thioesters and three malonyl-coa were catalysed by chs and eventually produce different chalcones for instance, a condensation reaction of p-coumaroyl-coa gives rise to naringenin chalcone while condensation of cinnamoyl-coa gives rise to pinocembrin chalcone  <cit> . it was reported that each chs has a different substrate preference by in vitro determining chs relative activity percentage  <cit> . although more than one chs gene was isolated from one species, some chs isoenzymes were constitutively expressed throughout the plant development with varying expression levels but some were expressed upon induction by environmental stresses including wounding, uv light and pathogen infections  <cit> . in the transcriptome data, it was showed that one out of  <dig> chs mapped in the kegg database, unigene1735_all, was up-regulated and seven other unigenes were down-regulated. thus, it could speculate that unigene1735_all is a key enzyme that directs the production of panduratin a. comparison of unigene1735_all with other chs in the nr database, the homology search results showed that unigene1735_all was highly similar to 3-ketoacyl synthase with 53-57% similarity. functional studies of unigene1735_all could be carried out to determine the substrate specificity and their derivative products.

from the findings, it was showed that some of the unigenes that were mapped to pal, chs, f3h and ans were up-regulated. in maize, the c <dig> myb transcription factor regulates pal, chs, f3h, dfr, ans and udp-glucose-flavonol glucosyltransferase in the flavonoid pathway  <cit> . in the results, one myb transcription factor was up-regulated  and correlated with the results of up-regulated unigenes with the exception of dfr. hence it is possible that the up-regulated myb in the boesembergia rotunda transcriptome data is the key regulator for up-regulating this set of unigenes, with the exception of dfr, in the flavonoid pathway. it is suggested that myb could be a potential target for strategies to overproduce panduratin a in boesenbergia rotunda.

gene regulation patterns in the flavonoid pathway  shows that the expression levels of unigenes for anthocyanin production such as f3h, fls and ans were higher compared to chalcone production at  <dig>  –  <dig>  fold higher in phenylalanine-treated samples than the control. in contrast, higher fold down-regulation was observed for chalcone production which includes pal, 4cl and chs showing a range  <dig>  –  <dig>  fold lower compared to the control. therefore, it could be inferred that exogenous phenylalanine induction causes a metabolic pathway shift towards higher anthocyanin production, and indirectly increases panduratin a production. unigenes that may be indirectly involved in the panduratin a biosynthetic pathway are shown in table  <dig>  genes directly involved remain to be elucidated until a reference pathway is available. nevertheless, the unknown unigenes may be involved and this merits further studies such as complementary experiment approach and gene overexpression studies as strategies to understand the unknown pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of boesenbergia rotunda transcriptome data to elucidate gene regulation pathways in response to exogenous phenylalanine treatment. through rna-seq and differentially expressed genes  analysis, gene regulation patterns in the panduratin a biosynthetic pathway was analysed in particular with respect to the flavonoid pathway. although enzymes that are directly involved in panduratin a production through chalcone remains to be elucidated, other unigenes appear as promising targets for strategies of overproduction of panduratin a in boesenbergia rotunda through a metabolic engineering strategy. the transcriptome data will also enrich the plant database as a reference for other zingiberceae family members.
