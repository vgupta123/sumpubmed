BACKGROUND
in the last years, microarray technology has demonstrated the power of the high-throughput study of gene expression in the unravelling of key processes of plant biology  <cit> . microarrays have become especially relevant for crop species where little genome information is available, and where intensive laboratory work is necessary to get insight into a particular biological process, as well as to identify candidate target genes for future breeding  <cit> .

citrus is the most economically important fruit crop in the world, with a total production of  <dig> million metric tons. there is a plethora of important commercial species and varieties, including sweet oranges, mandarins, lemons and grapefruits. variety improvement efforts have been hampered by general characteristics of citrus biology, such as apomixis, sexual incompatibility or prolonged juvenility, that limit classical molecular biology approaches. functional genomics is then viewed as a relatively easy way to move forward into the identification of candidate genes of agronomical relevance, and to the understanding of biological processes important for citriculture.

two years ago, aiming to develop genomic tools to assist future citrus research, we generated an est collection covering a wide range of tissues and developmental stages, as well as biotic and abiotic stress situations, and constructed a first-generation cdna microarray containing  <dig> putative unigenes to initiate the characterization of citrus transcriptome  <cit> . this first microarray has been used so far to monitor the transcriptional response of citrus in ovaries and young fruit during development and ripening of citrus flesh  <cit> , during ctv virus infection  <cit> , or under water stress conditions  <cit> , as well as to predict citrus varieties using expression profiles  <cit> .

however, to perform expression analysis in citrus at a more global scale, new microarray platforms with increased genome representation are mandatory. cdna microarrays are still a valuable tool for transcriptomic analysis in many species  <cit> . in plants, a cdna array containing more than  <dig>  unigenes has been recently generated for canola  <cit> . although cdna microarrays are being gradually substituted by oligo arrays due to reduction of manipulation steps during fabrication, and to their ability to detect similar members of some gene families, the validity of both platforms to perform reproducible and biologically consistent results has been clearly demonstrated, and the lack of concordance between microarray platforms has proven to be a failure of the metrics used to evaluate such concordance  <cit> . moreover, cdna microarrays seems to be the best option for comparative, evolutionary and ecological studies of closely related species  <cit> , taking profit that cross-hybridization is expected to occur in cdna arrays when sequence homology between targets and probes is higher than 70%  <cit> . this is especially relevant for citrus, a tree grown as a combination of the fruit-producing scion variety bud-grafted onto a rootstock variety adapted to the soil and environment, as many studies combine both parts of the tree. here we describe the design and creation of a publicly available cdna microarray that include  <dig>  putative unigenes of citrus. our microarray complements the recently released citrus affymetrix genechip  <cit>  and provides an alternative tool to perform global transcriptomic assays in these species. although the majority of gene fragments spotted on the array were isolated from citrus clementina, the cdna nature of our microarray extends its use to any citrus species  <cit> , allowing also comparison of scion/rootstock expression  <cit> . to illustrate their utility, we use this microarray to catalogue genes expressed in citrus globular embryos, and show how embryogenesis in citrus proceeds expressing a similar set of genes as it does in arabidopsis.

RESULTS
microarray design
the starting material for the selection of probes to be printed in the microarray were the cdna clone collection generated by the citrus functional genomics project   <cit> , and a number of external clones integrated in this collection  <cit> , as well as the  <dig>  trace files generated from all of them. details about the source cdna libraries can be found at cfgp homepage  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the steps in the selection of citrus unigenes to be represented in the microarray. after vector and low quality sequence trimming of the raw sequences obtained from the  <dig>  chromatograms available,  <dig>  high quality ests were obtained, with an average length of  <dig> bases. following sequence assembly of this est dataset,  <dig>  singletons were identified and the remaining ests clustered into  <dig>  contigs .

to further reduce the sequence redundancy in the  <dig>  citrus unigenes, a number of unigene clusters , grouping different unigenes with extensive sequence overlapping, was obtained . members of a superunigene could represent highly similar family members, alternative splicing or polymorphisms. since their sequence is very similar, they are expected to identify the same mrna species under standard hybridization conditions if used in cdna microarrays  <cit> . in an attempt to reduce such eventual spot cross-hybridizations, only one representative cdna clone per superunigene was selected to be printed in the microarray, and only clones producing a single pcr product were accepted , which produced a total of  <dig>  reasonably specific cdna probes. additional file  <dig> shows functional annotation of the genes represented in the microarray, including the id, description and e value of the first blast hit from the databases used for annotation , as well as their gene ontology classification  <cit>  and pfam domains  <cit> .

microarray representation
in order to estimate the genomic representation of the microarray, arabidopsis sequences similar to the citrus unigenes present in the microarray were identified and used for gene ontology  <cit>  functional classification . arabidopsis similar sequences  were found for  <dig>  citrus unigenes . the remaining 37% did not have any match in the arabidopsis genome with a blastx e value lower than 10- <dig>  as discussed in a former paper  <cit>  a proportion of these could be citrus or tree-specific genes, and demonstrate the importance of molecular studies in crop species, that can reveal interesting proteins and new biosynthetic pathways not yet discovered in other systems.

to demonstrate the potential of our microarray as an alternative to the existing citrus genechip  <cit> , a comparison between unigenes present in both platforms was performed. first, to equally evaluate the number of genes represented in every chip, we assembled the consensus sequences of the unigenes in the affymetrix chip according to our assembly parameters . the  <dig>  transcripts were reduced to  <dig>  unigene clusters , against the  <dig>  present in our cdna array. in addition, we have estimated how many genes are represented in our microarray and not in the affymetrix one. a blast search of the sequences represented in our cdna array against the consensus sequence of those included in the affymetrix chip revealed that  <dig> genes did not found a positive match with e value lower than 10- <dig>  . it implies that they could be analyzed only if using our cdna array. these results demonstrated that the microarray platform presented in this paper constitutes a complementary tool to the affymetrix genechip for genome-wide transcriptomic analysis in citrus plants.

database and website
using the est2uni package  <cit> , a web-browsable database was created  <cit>  and populated with information about the unigenes represented in the microarray, including cdna libraries, isolated clones, raw and processed nucleotide and protein sequences, and results of all the structural and functional annotation of the unigenes, like general description, blast hits, putative arabidopsis ortholog, microsatellites, putative snps, go classification  <cit>  and pfam  <cit>  domains. the web interface to the database is not just a collection of simple tables showing the data, or a simple query to search by using sequence identifiers or keywords. it also allows combination of almost every different functional and structural annotation criteria in the queries . additionally, bulk queries using a file with a list of unigene names or orthologs are implemented. the unigenes obtained as query results can be inspected individually, but also bulk downloads of the sequences, names or orthologs are allowed. the individual unigene web page view shows graphical and textual summaries of the assembly and annotation processes . hyperlinks to the first hits of the external databases searched with blast are provided, as well as their descriptions and e values. the full blast results can also be retrieved. gene ontology annotation results are also shown in a table with links to the go term description pages, using the amigo tool  <cit> .

functional catalogue of citrus genes expressed in the globular embryo
embryogenesis is a critical stage of the plant life cycle. the egg cell develops into a multicellular organism via a precise sequence of events  <cit> . during the first phase of embryogenesis, the body plan is being established, consisting in a shoot meristem, cotyledons, hypocotyl and root meristem along the apical-basal axis, and a concentric arrangement of epidermis, ground tissue and vascular cylinder along the radial axis. understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying embryogenesis can provide insight into developmental and metabolic regulation of this important stage of plant biology, and a big effort has been made in the two last decades in that direction  <cit> . a number of important genes and pathways have been identified, and recently, global analysis in arabidopsis has been performed to identify a set of expressed genes during different stages of early embryogenesis  <cit> .

we have performed a pilot experiment to catalogue the set of expressed genes in the citrus late globular embryo. citrus exhibit polyembrionic seed development  <cit> . in many species, non-zygotic embryos develop from the maternal nucellar tissue of the ovule surrounding the sexual embryo sac and develop together with the zygotic one. we crossed citrus clementina  with fortune   to obtain monoembryonic seeds and assure the analysis of expression only in zygotic embryos.

first, this experiment constitutes a proof of use of our microarray, demonstrating the utility of a multispecies citrus cdna microarray for expression studies. second, arabidopsis orthologs of many genes present in the microarray are already known to be expressed in the embryo, and it would be interesting to confirm whether these genes are also expressed in citrus embryos. moreover, the study could reveal novel interesting genes expressed during embryogenesis that initiate future works aimed to decipher their implication in this process.

five biological replicates were performed. correlation between replicates ranged between 75% and 90%. a total of  <dig>  genes were considered present in the late globular embryo, according to the criteria explained in materials and methods . that constitutes the 63% of the  <dig>  citrus unigenes examined in our microarray. in a recent paper,  <cit>  found 77% of the  <dig>  genes of the ath <dig> arabidopsis genechip to be expressed in the torpedo stage of embryogenesis. although the number of present genes should be taken as an estimation depending of the threshold values applied in each case, it reveals that virtually the whole cellular machinery is activated during embryogenesis, reflecting the high metabolic activity of meristematic and differentiating cells.

although mainly studied in arabidopsis, overall processes during plant embryogenesis are thought to be similar in other species  <cit> . of the  <dig> emb genes from arabidopsis catalogued by the seedgenes project  <cit> , aimed to identify genes that give seed phenotype when disrupted by mutation,  <dig> of them had a citrus ortholog and were present in the microarray, and 71% of these were found expressed in the globular embryo of citrus . the remaining ones could be present in a different embryo stage, or not detected due to their low expression  <cit> , although the possibility of not being expressed in the citrus embryo do not has to be neglected. citrus orthologs of the arabidopsis genes involved in embryo pattern-formation  <cit> , could also be detected by our microarray: orthologs of gnom, a gene involved in the establishment of the apical-basal axis, monopteros, whose mutation alters the normal division of embryonic cells, zwille, involved in establishing the primary shoot meristem in the embryo, or keule, gene responsible for the correct cytokinesis of the cell, were also expressed in the citrus embryo.

other genes or gene families recently known to have a role in plant embryogenesis are also expressed in citrus embryos. involvement of cell wall and remodelling of cell architecture  <cit> , regulation of mrna stability and translation through poly-a binding proteins  <cit> , regulation of development through pentatricopeptide repeat proteins  <cit> , the involvement of vesicle trafficking in organ development  <cit>  or the role of cell cycle genes in early stages of embryogenesis  <cit>  has been confirmed in citrus embryos by expression of sets of genes belonging to these functional categories. similarly, the well described role of auxins in establishment of embryo polarity  <cit>  or the recent implication of brassinosteroids in the acquisition of embryonic competence  <cit>  was confirmed in citrus embryos by expression of citrus orthologs of genes related to signalling and biosynthesis of these hormones .

much less is known about how early embryos prepare themselves for pathogen attack. it has been suggested that developing barley embryos activate a developmental defense activation programme where expression of defence genes is explained to involve control by developmental signals rather than induction by pathogens  <cit> . lipoxygenases  enzymes, that catalyse the first committed step in ja biosynthesis, have been described to be expressed in developing embryos  <cit> . we also found expression in globular citrus embryos of lox <dig> and lox <dig> homologues and of an ortholog to at1g <dig>  a 13-lipoxygenase enzyme considered so far to have minimal activity in embryos. moreover, functional classification of present genes reveals around 9% of genes belonging to the category "response to stress", 8% to the category "response to abiotic stress, 3% to the category "response to abiotic stress", and 3% to the category "defense". these data point towards a deployment of protection mechanisms in the citrus seed, already activated at the globular stage.

CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed a citrus  <dig> k cdna microarray which can be used for gene expression analysis in different species of citrus. we also provide access to a web-browsable database as a companion tool for this microarray. the database contains every structural and functional annotation related to the unigenes represented in the microarray. from a series of experiments on embryos development in citrus, it could be stated that our microarray allows reproducible global expression analysis in citrus, and that citrus embryogenesis share with the model plant arabidopsis thaliana many aspects of the developmental programme aimed to established the basic body plan of the adult plant. we would like to offer this microarray and the companion database to the citrus research community with the hope that future use of these genomic tools will uncover clues of the transcriptional regulation of genes in different citrus species, and during different aspects of productivity, like plant resistance, plant development, or fruit quality.
