BACKGROUND
studies of microbial biogeography and diversity provide a better understanding of the population structure, intraspecific genetic differentiation, and genetic diversity of these ubiquitous organisms  <cit> . unlike plants and animals, free-living microorganisms are predicted to exhibit little population structure because their small size and large numbers make them easily dispersed . if microbes are characterized by high gene flow, then this should decrease microbial diversity across the landscape  <cit> . however, several studies have found that microorganisms can exhibit biogeographical patterns . distinguishing between these two alternative hypotheses is especially important for social microorganisms because population structure affects social interactions  <cit> .

social amoebae live in decaying vegetative matter that forms the top layers of soil worldwide  <cit> . these social microorganisms are in the amoebozoa, the sister group of fungi plus animals  <cit> . most of the time, social amoebae exist as single cells that prey upon bacteria. however, when bacteria become scarce, tens of thousands of cells aggregate to form a multicellular fruiting body in which some amoebae die to form a stalk that supports the remaining cells that then differentiate into living drought-hardy spores  <cit> . the stalk holds aloft the spores from hazards of the soil  <cit>  and facilitates transport, and when conditions are favorable, the spores hatch and separate into individual amoebae.

sexual mating  in dictyostelids can occur if the right environmental conditions are met. this alternative life cycle to asexual fruiting body formation happens under high humidity and darkness  <cit>  . haploid cells of the appropriate mating types  fuse to form a giant cell . this giant cell ingests other amoebae that stream in, responding to the same chemoattractant used in the social stage, and increases in size  <cit> . then, the macrocyst forms a cellulose wall, before meiosis and cleavage occur, and eventually releases hundreds of haploid amoebae. this sexual stage has been reported in several dictyostelid species  <cit> , including some species with strains that are self-compatible  as well as cross-compatible , such as the most well-known and best-studied dictyostelid, d. discoideum. one to six mating types have been reported in different species .

morphological characters associated with both asexual fruiting body formation and sexual macrocyst formation have been traditionally used to classify the dictyostelids  <cit> . however, recent work by schaap et al.  <cit>  reconstructed a phylogeny of the dictyostelia using dna sequence data from multiple loci and found extensive genetic variation among dictyostelid species. mehdiabadi et al.  <cit>  examined within species variation in greater detail for the social amoeba dictyostelium purpureum and showed strong intraspecific genetic differentiation - some haplotypes found within d. purpureum were more divergent than a number of pairs of closely related but distinct species, suggesting the possibility of cryptic species. the objectives of the current study are  to examine the evolutionary history of dictyostelium giganteum by sequencing the same regions of the nuclear ribosomal dna, and using this phylogeny  to compare the level of intraspecific genetic variation between d. giganteum and d. purpureum and  to test predictions on the potential for sexual mating  between clones of d. giganteum with varying genetic and/or geographical distances. this work is fundamental to understanding social behavior among clones of d. giganteum , a dictyostelid with a wide geographic distribution  <cit> , because interactions between species have very different evolutionary trajectories than social interactions within species.

RESULTS
rdna gene tree
we sequenced, on average,  <dig> -bp of the rdna in all  <dig> samples and identified  <dig> unique haplotypes. with the two published d. giganteum species  this makes  <dig> unique haplotypes for use in the analyses. the most common haplotype  was present in four isolates . for all unique ribosomal dna haplotypes , we aligned  <dig>  sites  of which  <dig> were variable and  <dig> were parsimony informative . however, if we restrict our analysis to only d. giganteum haplotypes, we found  <dig> variable sites, , of which  <dig> were parsimony informative.

neighbor-joining, maximum parsimony , maximum likelihood , and bayesian analyses of the unique haplotypes produced similar topologies. figure  <dig> shows the rdna gene tree using only the bayesian approach. all analyses revealed weak evidence of phylogenetic structure despite the massachusetts and wisconsin isolates coming out at the base of the trees and the two mt. lake, va haplotypes being genetically distinct but sister nodes in all trees except for the mp tree. regardless, analyses of sequence data found very little genetic differentiation among isolates, and overall, relationships within d. giganteum were not well resolved in any of the trees.

we found small genetic distances between groups of lineages, substantially smaller than differences between closely related but distinct species. the average genetic distance between d. giganteum and outgroup taxa was  <dig>  , and  <dig>  between outgroups d. discoideum and d. citrinum. within d. giganteum, genetic distances ranged from  <dig> -  <dig>   and  <dig> -  <dig>  . the average pairwise sequence divergence between the basal lineages  and the rest of the d. giganteum clones was  <dig> .

overall, we found pronounced population differentiation for d. giganteum . pairwise population comparisons indicated that this was largely driven by the massachusetts group being different from both texas populations  given that no other pairwise population comparisons were significant . nevertheless, the sample sizes are very small, so power to test further structure is lacking.

mating experiments
the findings of low genetic divergence within d. giganteum, compared to the divergence between species, suggests that d. giganteum is a single species and sexual mating  in d. giganteum is just as likely to occur between pairs of isolates from throughout the tree and/or different geographic locations, assuming isolates are of different mating types. the two groups we focused on were the group consisting of the basal lineages  and the group containing the rest of the d. giganteum isolates given that fst estimates showed significant differentiation between the massachusetts and texas populations.

to test the above hypothesis, we performed three sets of 8-clone pairwise mating experiments with isolates that varied in both geographical and genetic distances. after replicating all of experiment # <dig> and two other pairwise matings from experiment # <dig> , we found our experimental design produced results that were repeatable 95% of the time . however so few of our clones formed macrocysts under any circumstances that it is likely that our conditions were not optimal for macrocyst production.

in all three experiments, we found that no isolates were homothallic , which confirmed previously published results for this species  <cit> . ten of the  <dig> isolates did not form macrocysts in any combination , including all eight isolates in experiment #2: qsgi <dig> , qsgi <dig> , qsgi <dig> , qsgi <dig> , qsgi <dig> , qsgi <dig> , qsgi <dig> , and qsgi <dig> . in addition, one clone, qsgi <dig>  produced only one to a few macrocysts with only two other isolates . in each of the three 8-clone experiments, we had a total of 7/ <dig>  0/ <dig>  and 10/ <dig> macrocysts form, respectively . this resulted in at least  <dig> apparent mating types or sexes . we defined mating types to be exclusive with no overlap.

for example, in experiment # <dig>  qsgi <dig>  qsgi <dig>  and qsgi <dig> were all considered the same mating type because all mated with qsgi <dig> but no other isolates did . overall, the data confirmed our hypothesis: there was no significant difference in the number of successful within and between group matings regardless of the time at which macrocyst formation was scored, neither after one week of scoring , nor after four weeks of scoring .

we also investigated whether the time to macrocyst formation for these pairs correlated with genetic distance between a pair of clones but found no significant relationship . the same was true for geographical distance .

discussion
several phylogeographic inferences can be made about d. giganteum from the phylogenetic analyses of the rdna sequence data. first, and most importantly, there appears to be very little genetic differentiation among isolates of d. giganteum and no clear evidence of phylogenetic structure. isolates from a given geographical location do not cluster together . the wisconsin and massachusetts isolates are basal on the bayesian , ml, mp, and neighbor-joining trees, indicating that isolates sampled from the north tend to be basal to isolates sampled from the south .

our results are very different than those found in a previous study for another dictyostelid species d. purpureum  <cit> . there is considerably more genetic variation and phylogenetic structure in d. purpureum than d. giganteum. mehdiabadi et al.  <cit>  also sequenced the same regions of the nuclear ribosomal dna that we did for d. giganteum, yet found pairwise genetic distances between some d. purpureum haplotpes to be more than twice as divergent than pairwise distances between taxa that are recognized as closely-related but distinct species. similar results were also found for the two d. purpureum clones used in schaap et al.  <cit> . isolates sampled for d. giganteum in the present study were more geographically dispersed throughout the united states but less genetically variable than the isolates sampled for d. purpureum in mehdiabadi et al.  <cit> . what accounts for these differences between the two dictyostelid species remains unknown. however, we also cannot rule out the possibility of a higher level of genetic variation for d. giganteum than observed if we included isolates from a wider geographic distribution.

since there was no clear evidence of phylogenetic structure and there was a low level of genetic differentiation in the rdna across haplotypes for this species, we predicted that sexual mating should occur between a pair of d. giganteum isolates across the species  regardless of geographical location or genetic distance. this is in contrast to d. purpureum - a species with extensive genetic variation and phylogenetic structure. mehdiabadi et al.  <cit>  predicted and found reduced sexual compatibility between d. purpureum isolates from different phylogenetic groups. however for d. giganteum, we found that sexual mating  did not correlate with either genetic or geographical distance . for example, qsgi <dig>  and qsgi <dig>  formed macrocysts despite differences in geography . furthermore, these two isolates were just as likely to mate with isolates separated by relatively large genetic distances as they were with isolates with very small genetic distances . we found for some pairs that if after the first week macrocysts did not form, that over time, they would eventually produce macrocysts .

although our predictions were confirmed that there was no correlation with either genetic or geographical distance and macrocyst formation, we did find a few inconsistent and ambiguous results, as previous work has shown in similar studies of macrocyst formation in dictyostelium. for example, experiments by erdos et al.  <cit>  also found that several strains of d. giganteum did not form macrocysts with any other strain they were paired with, and this happened for ten of our  <dig> isolates. in addition, they also found inconsistent mating patterns between some pairs of strains  <cit> . based on our findings, inconsistent mating reactions could be attributable to the time at which macrocyst formation is scored. that is, matings might be more likely to occur between a pair of clones, the more time the pair is given to mate. scenarios like this are known in other systems. for example, in fiddler crabs, females are less choosy in their male partners as search time for males increases  <cit> , and similar results have been found in bushcrickets  <cit> . in our experiments, a given clone had only one potential partner available for mating. another possible explanation for inconsistent matings between pairs of isolates is that pheromones, which have been found to induce macrocyst formation in d. giganteum strains  <cit> , may not be produced  under certain circumstances. thus, we also cannot rule out the possibility of imperfect environmental conditions for all possible pairwise matings as a reason for inconsistent mating reactions.

CONCLUSIONS
clearly, the north american isolates of d. giganteum comprise a single species, which means that social theory is applicable to interactions among clones. genetic distance between interacting pairs may influence the nature of their interactions. in dictyostelium, both mehdiabadi et al  <cit>  and ostrowski et al.  <cit>  found a positive correlation in the degree of mixing between a pair of isolates and their genetic distance for d. purpureum and d. discoideum, respectively. in a related study, kaushik et al.  <cit>  conducted pairwise mixtures among five isolates of d. giganteum from india and found that when different clones mix, they form predominantly clonal fruiting bodies and only sometimes form chimeric fruiting bodies. these differences in the degree of chimeric fruiting body formation between pairs of clones may be due to their sequence divergence. future work is needed to determine whether the degree of mixing correlates with genetic distance for this species as has been found for other dictyostelid species  <cit>  and to understand what accounts for such different patterns of intraspecific genetic variation of this important group of eukaryotic social microbes.
