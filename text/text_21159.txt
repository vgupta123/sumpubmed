BACKGROUND
penicillium digitatum and p. italicum, the causal agent of green and blue mold decay, respectively, are important postharvest diseases of citrus and cause heavy losses around the world  <cit> . biological control using microbial agents  is considered to be a viable alternative to the use of synthetic fungicides. among microbial agents, yeasts have several good properties that make them ideal antagonists, including the ability to survive in adverse environmental conditions, having few nutritional requirements and being amenable to formulation with a long shelf-life  <cit> . furthermore, yeast strains can degrade mycotoxins, which are well known for being toxic to humans and animals  <cit> . over  <dig> yeasts have been isolated and investigated for their biocontrol efficacy against postharvest fruit diseases. some yeast-based products have been registered as commercially available biocontrol agents such as “aspire”   <cit> . knowledge about the modes of action of biocontrol agents is essential for developing appropriate commercial formulations and application methods to maximize the potential use of biocontrol agents  <cit> .

several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the antifungal activity of biocontrol agents. wound colonization and nutrient competition appear as the primary mechanisms . other attributes of yeast that have been associated with their biocontrol activity include the production of antifungal compounds  . the most thoroughly studied example is farnesol from candida albicans  <cit> , which can inhibit various bacteria and fungus  <cit> . production of antimicrobial compounds is not restricted to candida; they can also be found in other yeast genera: cryptococcus, saccharomyces, hanseniaspora, hansenula, kluyveromyces, pichia, rhodotorula, tilletiopsis and meyerozyma  <cit> .

recently, several studies have focused on antifungal compounds from natural sources as an effective alternative to chemical preservatives, e.g., phenylacetic acid , phenyllactic acid  and phenylethanol . pea, a colorless liquid with a rose-like odour, occurs widely in nature, including in a variety of essential oils extracted from rose, jasmine, carnation and, hyacinths  <cit> . greater attention has been paid to studying the antimicrobial properties of pea , and in addition screening of yeasts for the production of pea for natural products in the cosmetic and food industry  <cit> .

in spite of the information available in literature, few extensive isolation studies of antibiotic antifungal compounds from antagonistic yeast are available. the objective of this study is to identify and characterize of antifungal compounds from the antagonistic yeast strain k. apiculata 34– <dig>  and study their fungistatic activities.

RESULTS
extraction of antifungal substances produced by k. apiculata
in vitro, k. apiculata 34– <dig> showed antagonistic properties against p. digitatum and p. italicum  in pda medium. meanwhile, antifungal substances were efficiently extracted by ether from both the cell-free culture and cells of k. apiculata .figure  <dig>

antifungal activity was not affected by trypase, proteinase k , or high temperature  treatments, but it was sensitive to alkaline ph . the activity was stable at ph values between  <dig>  and  <dig> , but it rapidly decreased between  <dig>  and  <dig> . a peak of inhibition was observed at the end of log phase , which is produced by intracellular extraction, and four hours later  the same peak is produced by extracellular extraction and four hours later  there was another little increase . the result showed four hours delay between antifungal compound biosynthesis and secretion.figure  <dig>

k. apiculata
to intra/extra-cellular antifungal activity. effect of the number of k. apiculata on antifungal compounds secretion was investigated by statistic correlation between the cells number and antifungal activity that was extracted from the cell-free culture  and cells of k. apiculata  respectively. the assays were performed in 50-ml bsm broth at 28°c with  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml of k. apiculata initially. samples were analyzed for the number of k. apiculata, extra- and intracellular activity at intervals of 2 h. antifungal effects were recorded with inhibition diameter  after 48 h culture at 28°c in pda medium .



purification and identification of antifungal substances
the raw extract was first purified by thin-layer chromatography  eluting with ether and benzene . the retention factor  value of active fractions was  <dig> . we collected these active fractions and further separated them by petroleum ether and ethyl acetate . iodine vapor showed that only a white spot  on a light brown background had antifungal activity . the white spot was collected for the further purification. hplc revealed that retention time  of this antifungal compound was  <dig>  min .figure  <dig> 
purification of the antifungal compound. a: silica plate tlc purification. the tlc separation was performed with petroleum ether: ethyl acetate  and visualized using iodine vapor. then compounds in the tlc were directly transferred to pda medium  by blotting. the spot of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were antifungal compound  in tlc , its corresponding antifungal spots in pda. b: semi-preparative hplc purification. the hplc were performed with c <dig> reversed-phase column, 2: <dig> methanol-h2o , and 210 nm detection c: lc-ms analysis. the lc-ms was analyzed with c <dig> reversed-phase column, ion source temperature, gas temperature 200°c, nebulizer 15 psi and hv capillary 3500 v.   <dig>  tandem ms chromatogram,   <dig>  tandem ms chromatogram,  total ion chromatogram  and extracted ion chromatogram  for  <dig> and  <dig> 



the collected sample from semi-preparative hplc was analysed by lc-ms. through the exploration of conditions, the purified sample indicated prominent m/z ions at  <dig> and  <dig>  and their extracted ion chromatogram  were in keeping with the peak of antifungal compound of lc-ms total ion chromatogram  and dad spectrogram. the ms/ms revealed that m/z  <dig> and  <dig> derived from the same compound . the sample was then analyzed by gc-ei-ms. consequently, this antifungal compound was determined to be 2-phenylethanol  . in addition, other compounds, including 2-phenylacetic acid , phenyllactate , and phenylpyruvate , were identified in the raw extract, revealing antifungal substances produced by k. apiculata were closely related to the l-phenylalanine  metabolic pathway.figure  <dig>

l-phe metabolic pathway of k. apiculata was analyzed using  isotope labeling of l-phe. figure  <dig> showed that the largest signal was 13c-labeled pea, followed by 13c-labeled 2-phenylacetaldehyde , paa and phenylpyruvate. the concentration of pea in culture increased with time , whereas 13c-labeled pad decreased with the time . this confirmed that pea was produced via l-phe, and that pad is an intermediate product of pea  <cit> .figure  <dig>

we also analyzed the antifungal activity of the l-phe metabolite, paa, which is known to possess antifungal properties  <cit> . we found that paa inhibited the pathogenic fungus in vitro and in vivo, but it did not effectively control the occurrence of disease in storage . this result further confirmed pea as the main antifungal compound of k. apiculata.

effect of pea on fungal cells
transmission electron microscopy  showed that the action of the raw extract  on ultra-cellular p. italicum was closely associated with mitochondrial abnormalities , including degraded and disorganized cristae, leakage of the outer membrane, and massive mitochondrial vacuolation. meanwhile, pea  induced hyphal cells with abnormal subcellular morphology . the prominent features were massive mitochondrial vacuolation and vacuole mediated organelle degradation.figure  <dig>

to test whether pea’s inhibition of fungal cells was associated with a change in the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  and propidium iodide  staining and membrane electric conductivity were performed . pi is a membrane-impermeable stain in normal healthy cells, but it readily penetrates the membranes of dead cells. as a control, no pi staining in the nucleus was detected in the strain with or without pea treatment , consistent with results on conductivity, suggesting that the hyphae were intact . similar result was found in hyphae of aspergillus flavus in the presence of pea  <cit> .figure  <dig>

rna-seq profiling of the response of p. italicum to pea
regulation of gene expression was investigated using comparative rna-seq profiling analysis. samples of 0 h , 1 h  and 3 h  treatment were used for the construction of rna-seq libraries. after removal of reads with adaptors, unknown bases, low-quality reads , there were total of  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> successful sequences , produced by pea <dig>  pea <dig>  and ck, respectively. the distribution of total clean tags was quite similar at pea <dig>  pea <dig>  and ck .

clean reads were mapped to reference sequences using soapaligner/soap <dig>  <cit> , and mismatches of no more than  <dig> bases were allowed in the alignment. a total of mapped genes in pea <dig>  pea <dig>  and ck were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of the reference genes . analysis of differential expression at pea <dig> and pea <dig> compared to ck revealed  <dig> and  <dig> up-regulated genes,  <dig> and  <dig> down-regulated genes, respectively. of these,  <dig> and  <dig> genes  share the same up- and down-regulation expression pattern in pea <dig> and pea <dig>  gene ontology categories were assigned to the  <dig> genes with significantly differential expression using the blast2go program  to evaluate the potential functions of genes that showed significant transcriptional differences between ck and pea treatment . seventeen gene categories were defined. major categories were metabolism , cellular , localization , and regulation . the significant enrichment categories classified on the basis of molecular function were catalytic activity , binding , structural molecule activity  and transporter activity . the genes were classified on the basis of cellular compound into cell , cell part , organelle , macromolecular complex , organelle part , membrane-enclosed lumen , envelop , virion  and virion part . among them, membrane-enclosed lumen, macromolecular complex and organelle were major subcellular organelles that responded to pea stress.figure  <dig> 
functional categorization of the genes with significant transcriptional changes between the pea treatment and the control type. the total same changed genes  were categorized based on gene ontology  annotation. the proportion of each category is displayed based on: biological process; molecular function; cellular component.



the pea-responsive genes were further assessed using kegg pathway analysis. a total of  <dig> different metabolic pathways were found with more than  <dig> affiliated genes, of which some were consistent with biological processes that were already identified by go analysis. the most represented pathways are listed in table  <dig>  the prominent related pathways were ribosome, amino acids biosynthesis, aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis, cell cycle, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, rna polymerase, and dna replication. data indicated that ribosome, endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus were the major subcellular organelles in response to pea, which is in accord with tem data and the physiological indices.table  <dig>

to confirm that the degs identified by deep sequencing were indeed differentially expressed, a total of  <dig> genes were chosen for confirmation in a biologically independent experiment using qrt-pcr, including ribosome, autophagy, proteasome and fatty acid synthesis-related genes, which were detected in the transcriptome and bioinformatic analyses. the relative transcript abundance patterns for the ck and pea treatment were compared using the transcriptome data. the results of qrt-pcr revealed similar expression patterns as the illumina sequencing despite some quantitative differences in the expression levels .figure  <dig>

discussion
various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the biocontrol of antagonistic yeast to fungal pathogens. prominent among these is the suggestion that yeast competes with pathogens for nutrients and space  <cit> . as the safest microbes, yeasts are common on the surfaces of fruits and vegetables, which have used in food preparation for millennia. previous reports suggest that the antagonistic yeast usually does not depend on the production of antibiotics, but rather on their ability to colonize and grow rapidly in surface wounds  <cit> . here, we identified an antifungal compound pea from k. apiculata 34– <dig> that produced by ehrlich pathway from l-phe, and their potential application in the field of citrus postharvest pathology is unexplored.

as an aromatic alcohol, pea has been approved for use to modify certain flavor compositions of foods in the usa. the acute toxicity ld <dig>  of pea was classified as low toxicity . it inhibits a range of bacteria, such as bacillus subtilis, ralstonia solanacearum and escherichia coli  <cit> . in e. coli, pea appears to inhibit the syntheses of dna  <cit> , and an increase in membrane fluidity caused by pea has been demonstrated in myxococcus xanthus  <cit> . also, pea inhibits synthesis of macromolecules and phospholipids metabolism  <cit> . lester  <cit>  showed that pea exhibited activity in vitro against fungi neurospora crassa, and inhibition of growth and of the syntheses of rna, dna and protein. furthermore, pea inhibits rna, dna, protein and aminoimidazole ribotide syntheses, cytoplasmic respiratory, and glucose uptake and incorporation in yeast  <cit> . zhu et al.  <cit>  inferred that pea competes for attachment on the active site of the enzyme with l- <dig> -dihydroxyphenylalanine due to its –oh group.

although the mode of action of pea on bacteria and fungi has been described, our study represents the first comprehensive transcriptome study of the inhibition process. illumina sequencing was used to monitor the global transcriptional change in the pea treatment compared with the control, and  <dig> differentially expressed genes that were induced or repressed by more than two fold at different treatment times, were identified. rna-seq data showed that the action of pea on p. italicum resembles its effect on n. crassa and yeast; ribosome, mitochondrion, macromolecular complex, endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus were the major subcellular organelles in response to pea.

a number of new genes possibly related with the inhibition process were found in this study. functional category analysis revealed that a number of important pathways may work collaboratively in inhibiting the fungal cell growth. the first noticeable pathway is the amino acid and protein biosynthesis pathways which exist in the plastids.  <dig> out of  <dig> dges of ribosome and aminoacyl-trna synthetases , and  <dig> out of  <dig> dges of amino acid biosynthesis were down-regulated . based on these data, it can be speculated that the inhibition of the amino acids and protein biosynthesis resulted in inhibition. the structure of pea and rna-seq data from pea-inhibited cultures lead us to suppose that the pea might compete for attachment on the active site of fungi phenylalanyl-trna synthetase  by the formation of a stable trnaphe-pea  <cit> , thus inhibiting protein synthesis, rna transcription and energy demanding processes.

the second group of pea-responsive pathways includes dna replication, meiosis and cell cycle pathways. most of these genes also exhibited down-regulation pattern in pea treatment. the induction of genes associated with cell cycle is consistent with the go results that indicate that large numbers of genes are located in nucleus; and is in line with our physiological analysis that the nucleus is one of the major subcellular organelles in response to pea.

the third group of metabolite pathways represents those related with cell death including phagosome, proteasome, peroxisome and regulation of autophagy. most of these genes were up-regulated indicated that pea induced fungal cells autophagy or programmed cell death.

our study also showed that pea and paa were identified in the raw extract, and both of them are known to have antimicrobial properties. both pea and paa inhibited citrus green and blue molds in vitro and in vivo. however, paa was ineffective in fruit storage. fungus pathogens suppress host cell defense responses by acidification of the fruit with organic acids, such as citric and gluconic . maybe, paa causes low ph in fruit tissue.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified an antifungal compound from biocontrol agent k. apiculata 34– <dig> and provided a global picture of the gene expression changes in a pea treatment comparing with control type. the interpretation of the illumina sequencing data uncovered a large number of genes with previously not known to be involved in the inhibition process. functional categorization of the differentially expressed genes showed that a number of important pathways, including amino acids and protein biosynthesis, cell cycle and cell death cross communicated and worked collaboratively in inhibiting phytopathogenic fungi. this study provided new insight into the mode of action of biocontrol yeast agents in controlling postharvest pathogenic fungi.
