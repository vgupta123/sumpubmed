BACKGROUND
the leucine-rich glioma inactivated  protein consists of an n-terminal region which has a putative signal peptide suggesting that the protein is either secreted or membrane bound followed by leucine-rich repeats  which are flanked by cysteine-rich repeats domains  <cit> . the c-terminal region has seven eptp repeats which form a seven bladed beta-propeller structure  <cit> . the eptp repeats were also found in three paralogues of lgi <dig>  as well as in two other genes  which constitute the eptp superfamily  <cit> .

lgi <dig> is the best studied gene of the lgi family and it is responsible for causing autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy  or autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features , one type of familial temporal lobe epilepsy. it was the first human idiopathic epilepsy known to be caused by mutations in a non-ion channel gene  <cit> . epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain sometimes signal abnormally. several studies have been carried out on lgi <dig> and had shown that point mutations on this gene have caused defects in secretion  <cit> . also, clinical studies have shown that up to 50% of patients with adtle have mutations in their lgi <dig> gene  <cit> . using gene-history and expression analyses, lgi2- <dig> have been suggested as candidate genes for human disorders  <cit> .

in our previous work, arguments based on protein sequence analysis and patient-specific chromosomal deletions are provided for lgi <dig> as the prime candidate gene for partial epilepsy with pericentral spikes   <cit> . both peps and adlte are temporal lobe epilepsies and lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> are closely related paralogues that share the same functional domains. the overall aim of the study is to investigate whether snps in lgi <dig> have similar effects as in lgi <dig> by causing secretory defects, the known pathogenic mechanism of several lgi <dig> mutations  <cit> . thus, we experimentally investigated both the reported but yet functionally uncharacterized mutations and snps in lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> genes, as well as a few additional mutations with theoretically derived functional hypothesis. we observed a reproducible phenotype in terms of lack of protein secretion  for both lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> if structurally homologous positions are mutated that are conserved throughout the lgi family and known to cause disease in lgi <dig>  hence, we suggest that there is a similar underlying disease mechanism for lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> and we propose that each of the lgi family members might be responsible for phenotypically similar, mechanistically related but genotypically distinct forms of epilepsy.

RESULTS
mapping of non-synonymous snps and known disease mutations
we searched for non-synonymous snps and known disease mutations of lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> in the literature   <cit>  and dbsnp  <cit>  and mapped them to the domain architectures of lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> . in total, we found data for  <dig> missense mutations for lgi <dig> that cause adlte and  <dig> non-synonymous snps for lgi <dig> . six of the lgi <dig> mutations , as well as  <dig> out of the  <dig> snps in lgi <dig> , were localized in the ear propeller region that presumably interacts with adam metalloproteases  <cit> . moreover, one of the snps in lgi <dig>  is found in the n-terminal region comprising the signal peptide. therefore, we put an artificial mutation lgi <dig> l26r  <cit>  which is located in the signal peptide region for additional study concurrently with lgi <dig> i24t. the remaining mutations in lgi <dig> are spread throughout the n-terminal half that includes the leucine-rich repeats.

analysis of severity of the mutations in the evolutionary context
we investigated all snps and missense mutations of lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> in the evolutionary context of the alignment of lgi family members by using sift  <cit>  and polyphen  <cit> . these programs predict the severity of effects of a mutation depending on the degree of amino acid conservation in the mutated position and how different, in terms of physicochemical properties, a mutated residue is compared to the repertoire of amino acids naturally found in this position.

the summary of results of sift and polyphen are shown in table  <dig>  for sift, all  <dig> missense mutations of lgi <dig> gave a score lower than  <dig> . this implies they are predicted to be deleterious and affect protein functions. polyphen predicts that most of the missense mutations are probably damaging . for the artificial mutation lgi <dig> l26r, sift and polyphen results are predicted to be tolerated and benign, respectively. among the  <dig> non-synonymous snps of lgi <dig>  only k347e is predicted by sift to be deleterious. i24t and r444q have scores close to the classification threshold . similarly, only k347e is predicted by polyphen to be possibly damaging, while the other three are all predicted to be benign.

unfortunately, none of the reported mutations in lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> correspond to one and the same homologous position in the respective sequences. for later experimental study, we include two more control mutations that are structurally homologous in lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> and would map to a reported disease mutation in lgi <dig> or a non-synonymous snp in lgi <dig>  these are lgi <dig> v420e  and lgi <dig> k353e . the sift method predicts for both new mutations to be deleterious and, for polyphen, lgi <dig> v420e is predicted to be probably damaging while lgi <dig> k353e is predicted to have a less severe effect and only be possibly damaging.

effects of the artificial mutation lgi <dig> l26r and lgi <dig> snp i24t on signal peptide and cleavage site prediction
lgi <dig> l26r and lgi <dig> i24t, that are both predicted by sift and polyphen to cause little damage, are actually part of the n-terminal signal peptides that are required to translocate the proteins to the er and out of the cell. therefore, we analyzed if the mutations would possibly alter the localization motif as predicted by signalp  <cit> .

for the wild-type of lgi <dig>  the cleavage site is predicted between positions  <dig> and  <dig>  while the i24t snp appears to still have a valid signal peptide but with a predicted cleavage site shift . for wild-type lgi <dig>  the cleavage site is predicted between positions  <dig> and  <dig> . for the artificial mutation lgi <dig> l26r, signalp does not predict a signal peptide anymore .

as opposed to lgi <dig> i24t that is predicted to only have a minor effect, lgi <dig> l26r is in the hydrophobic helical segment of the signal peptide motif and exchange of a hydrophobic leucine with a positively charged arginine definitely alters the physicochemical properties of the whole region. consequently, the lgi <dig> l26r mutation is hypothesized to alter efficiency of secretion. to clarify these predictions, we measured the effect of these mutations on secretion from mammalian cells .

phylogenetic analysis of ear domain containing protein families
it should be emphasized that lgi proteins have considerable sequence identity and similarity. their alignments as well as the construction of phylogenetic tree are not difficult. in terms of pairwise sequence identity, lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> are most similar to each other , while lgi <dig> would appear most distant to all other lgis .

mutations in lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> propeller domain structure models
since many of the snps and mutations analyzed in this study are located in the ear domains of lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> and this region is presumed to harbor the site for interaction with adam metalloproteases  <cit> , we constructed a  <dig> d structural model of this domain . the evolutionary conserved residues found in the alignment of lgi family members were mapped to the surface of the model. obviously, there is a concentration of these residues at one side of the propeller. indeed, beta-propeller structures often function as protein interaction modules and there are known examples where conserved sites are limited to one "flat" side of the propeller and serve as protein binding interface  <cit> . hence, also the conservation pattern in our lgi <dig> model could be explained by having a conserved protein interaction site at this side of the propeller. this site is shared among the lgi family members  and might be responsible for the interaction with adam metalloproteases or, possibly, other functional critical proteins. in support of this, it was shown recently that at least lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> share the same repertoire of adams as binding partners  <cit> . interestingly, many reported ear domain mutations of both lgi <dig>  and lgi <dig>  are co-localized in the conserved surface patches and, hence, are hypothesized to interfere with protein function by affecting the interaction site. for example, the k to e mutation at the position  <dig> of lgi <dig> alters the electrostatic potential of its environment. two other mutations in the propeller domain of lgi <dig>  are not involved in the putative binding interface and could be less severe since they maintain polar physicochemical properties and they are pointing into the  solvent.

expression patterns of lgi family members
given the shared domain architecture among the lgi family and the conserved set of interaction partners , lgi family members can be assumed to have quite similar molecular functions. however, since disease causing mutations in one lgi cannot be compensated by the remaining unmutated lgis, it has been suggested that each lgi family member might execute its respective function in different expression contexts  <cit> . in table  <dig>  we compile available expression data from multiple sources  <cit> , and confirm that lgi family members have tissue-specific and only weakly overlapping expression patterns in different parts of the brain.

effects of lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> mutations on protein secretion
all snps in lgi <dig> and several not yet experimentally characterized mutations in lgi <dig> including the artificial mutation were tested for their effect on secretion of the protein. hek <dig> cells were transfected with c-terminal gfp tagged expression constructs of wild-type or mutant lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> proteins. hek <dig> cells without any expression construct were used as a control for transfection efficiency. the results are shown in figure  <dig> 

lgi <dig> wt is being secreted strongly into the conditioned medium ; yet, some is being retained in the lysate. only with long exposure time, the artificial l26r mutant can still be detected in the conditioned medium, which means that lgi <dig> l26r is just minimally secreted. the ear domain mutation k353e in lgi <dig>  does not seem to have any effect on the secretion of the protein as compared to the other mutations of lgi <dig>  in all other cases, the lgi <dig> mutation constructs resulted in robust lgi <dig> expression in cell lysates indicating that the mutations in lgi <dig> result in secretory defects. also, the secreted protein of lgi <dig> wt, lgi <dig> l26r and lgi <dig> k353e were observed to be of higher molecular weight as compared to those that are being retained in the lysate suggesting posttranslational modifications of the former along the secretion pathway .

on the other hand, mutations in lgi <dig>  did not show any change in the secretion level when compared to that of the wild-type. the lgi <dig> protein was observed both in the conditioned media and cell lysate indicating that most snps in lgi <dig> do not cause secretory defects. however, lgi <dig> v420e was found to be retained in the lysate similar to lgi <dig> v432e where the mutation is in the homologous sequence position. similarly, secreted proteins of lgi <dig> were observed to be of higher molecular weight as compared to those being retained in the lysate .

glycosylation of lgi proteins
the expected protein band size is about  <dig> kda but the actual band size is almost  <dig> kda. the higher mass observed might also be due to glycosylation or other modifications of the protein  <cit> . to test this, we performed pngase f treatment of lgi <dig> wt and lgi <dig> wt. figure  <dig> shows that both isoforms undergo a substantial molecular weight shift when treated with pngase f, suggesting that both are indeed glycosylated.

subcellular localisation of lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> mutant proteins
with microscopy, the subcellular localization of the non-secreted mutant variants was studied. cos <dig> cells were transfected with expression constructs for each mutation including a c-terminal gfp-tag based on the pegfpn <dig> vector. cos <dig> cells with the empty vector were used as controls. we found that lgi <dig> wt and lgi <dig> k353e are localized predominantly in the golgi and partially in the er. but the other mutants are more predominant in the er .

as for lgi <dig> and its mutants, they show similar localization in both er and golgi with the exception of lgi <dig> v420e which is localized mainly in the er . these observations are consistent with the secretory western blot results as proteins that are secreted most likely are translated and processed in the rough er and transported to the golgi vesicles before they are being secreted. as for proteins that have secretory defects, they are most likely retained in the er because they are misfolded or otherwise not normally processed because of their mutations.

discussion
in this study, we report that lgi disease mutations alter protein secretion and stability showing that the clinical epilepsy phenotype likely arises from loss of protein function. this is in agreement with lgi <dig> knockout mice that showed lethal epileptic seizures  <cit> . while experimental data for lgi <dig> is abundant, lgi <dig> has been mostly neglected so far. this is the first report to show effects of lgi <dig> snps in detail.

previous and this work show that molecular pathogenesis of several lgi <dig> mutations involves alteration of secretion levels of lgi <dig> which causes the protein to be retained in the cells and, thereby, abolishes its potential to function in its normal signaling role in the extracellular space of the synaptic cleft  <cit> . we explored the effect of secretion of several lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> mutations and our data strongly suggest that mutations at sequentially and structurally homologous positions have the same effect on secretion in lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> 

protein secretion via the standard secretion pathway requires a functional signal peptide as targeting motif. we found one signal peptide related snp in lgi <dig> and we studied the artificial mutation lgi <dig> l26r which is also located in the signal peptide region. we demonstrated that lgi <dig> l26r is secreted to a much lesser extent compared to wild-type lgi <dig>  we show by pngase f treatment that, upon secretion, both lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> are glycosylated, which has not been shown previously for lgi <dig> 

our study increases the total number of mutations in lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> that were tested experimentally for effects on secretion from previously  <dig> to  <dig>  interestingly, the computational classification of the mutations by sift  <cit>  and polyphen  <cit>  as tolerated or deleterious coincides with the observation of normal or lack of secretion, respectively, in  <dig> out of  <dig> cases . the only obviously wrong prediction is associated with the artificial l26r mutation in the signal peptide, a non-globular segment. tools like sift and polyphen have been developed for learning set of mutations in globular  <dig> d structures and can provide a reasonably correct estimate regarding disease effects if new mutations in globular regions of lgi family members need to be tested.

however, when all but  <dig> snp are outside of the signal peptide motif, how can they influence secretion? sift and polyphen evaluated the alteration of amino acid properties following the mutation at otherwise evolutionary conserved positions and its role for the intactness of the  <dig> d structure of globular domains. we found a possible answer by experimentally investigating the whereabouts of the non-secreted mutants in the cell using a fluorescent label that allows us to visualize the protein's subcellular localization. we observe that proteins without secretion phenotype, including the wild-type, are predominantly found in the golgi  while the mutants that are known to cause disease  cannot leave the cell and are accumulated in the er. this can be interpreted as classical fate of misfolded proteins that are caught and degraded by quality control mechanisms in the er that ensure that only properly folded proteins are allowed to move further along the secretory pathway  <cit> . our results are in agreement with previous studies for other missense mutations of lgi <dig> that were also found to be defective in secretion and to accumulate in the er  <cit> .

finally, in order to test our hypothesis that lgi <dig> could follow a similar disease mechanism as lgi <dig> we introduced new mutations of selected residues that are  part of the conserved ear propeller because it is presumably functionally important,  structurally homologous in lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> and  tested as mutations in their respective proteins for secretion phenotypes. in particular, we introduced the same mutation that caused secretion deficiency in lgi <dig>  to lgi <dig>  and also observed lack of secretion of the lgi <dig> mutant. inversely, a mutation that did not alter secretion in lgi <dig>  also did not affect lgi <dig> . these results finally corroborated the similarity in mutational effects on secretion between lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> 

on the other hand, lgi <dig> k347e and lgi <dig> k353e are predicted to be deleterious by both sift and polyphen, apparently, because of the charge reversal but they did not show any er retention or secretion deficiency and, thus, appear to fold properly. lgi <dig> k347e and lgi <dig> k353e are structurally homologous and located centrally in an evolutionary conserved region on the surface of the ear propeller structure and it is unlikely that the charge conservation is not important for function. if the conserved surface patch at the one side of the ear propeller is indeed the critical site for interactions , then it is likely that the pathogenetic mechanism is related to an inhibition of physiological interactions.

recently, the pattern of expression of each lgi gene was studied using digoxigenin-based in situ hybridization. lgi family members demonstrated distinct expression in different regions of the brain  <cit> . lgi <dig> is intensely expressed in intrahippocampal circuitry consistent with the clinical temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome associated with mutations of lgi <dig>  <cit> . on the contrary, the distribution of lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> expression is confined to the medial septum and nucleus reticularis thalami. finally, the lgi <dig> gene exhibits a widespread expression in different neuronal types  <cit> . these new results, as well as our collection of previous expression data  suggest that specialization of the individual lgi subfamily members is achieved by expression in different tissues or cell types. this also explains why disease mutations in lgi <dig> are not rescued by the other lgis despite their high sequence similarity.

experimental testing of cellular effects of mutations in both lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> reported in this work results in an effective doubling of experimentally characterized mutations in lgi proteins and, hence, generally advances our understanding of molecular disease mechanisms of lgi-related epilepsies. following the line of evidence presented in this paper and collected from previous reports, we arrive at the conclusion that lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> apparently share the cellular mechanism of causing genotypically distinct but phenotypically related forms of epilepsy. the multiplicity of functionally redundant lgi genes appears necessary due to the hardly overlapping tissue-specific expression patterns.

CONCLUSIONS
we provide substantial arguments for lgi <dig> as candidate for epilepsy phenotypes compatible with peps. furthermore, we find similarity of experimental mislocalization phenotypes for mutations at homologous positions of lgi <dig> and the established epilepsy gene lgi <dig>  suggesting that both genes share a common molecular disease mechanism causing genotypically distinct but phenotypically related forms of epilepsy.
