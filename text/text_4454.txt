BACKGROUND
atp-binding cassette -transporters exist in all three kingdoms of life and transport a large variety of substrates across biological membranes. in addition to their well-documented role in solute transport, a diversity of sensory functions have been assigned that implicate abc-transporters in the maintenance of cell integrity, responses to environmental stresses, cell-to-cell communication and cell differentiation and in pathogenicity. based on the direction of transport, abc transporters can be classified as either exporters or importers. both classes are characterized by the coupling of two nucleotide-binding domains  and two transmembrane domains . in the case of abc importers, which are found exclusively in prokaryotes, a fifth domain, termed the solute binding protein , is part of the functional unit  <cit> . sbps bind their ligands with high affinity and deliver them to the permease unit , where the substrate is released into the translocation pore upon atp binding and hydrolysis in the nbds  <cit> . sbps are located in the periplasm of gram-negative bacteria, or lipid-anchored to the cell wall, or fused to the tmd in the case of gram-positive bacteria and archaea  <cit> . although sbps of gram-negative bacteria exist predominantly as stand-alone periplasmic proteins, they are sometimes connected in a fusion protein with the tmd  <cit>  or observed lipid-anchored to the inner membrane  <cit> . the physiological relevance of the immobilized versions of sbps remains largely unaddressed in the literature.

based on sequence homology analyses, the bacterial sbp superfamily has been classified into  <dig> clusters, with cluster  <dig> comprising dipeptide binders , oligopeptide binders  and nickel specific sbp's   <cit> . continuous family updates by the transporter classification database http://www.tcdb.org has now led to a cluster  <dig> sbps containing up to  <dig> different subfamilies that are associated with translocation cargos as diverse as - in addition to di-and oligo-α-peptides and nickel substrates - antimicrobial peptides, δ-aminolevulinic acid, heme, plant opines, carbohydrates, the osmoprotective proline betaine, and the metal-chelater ethylene diamine tetraacetate. the most recent addition to the sbp family is termed gbpa , a lipoprotein from haemophilus influenzae, which binds reduced  and oxidized  forms of glutathione to prime the dipeptide-dppbcdf abc-transporter for glutathione translocation across the inner membrane  <cit> . structural studies of the highly homologous gbpa from h. parasuis in complex with gssg have revealed structural features that typify cluster  <dig> sbps, namely, a pear-shaped, two-domain α/β-fold that collapses about the hinge region connecting the n-and c-terminal domains to sandwich the molecular cargo, in this case a single gssg molecule  <cit> . in the absence of ligand, sbp's are flexible with the two domains rotating around the hinge and existing largely in the open conformation with both domains separated. substrate binding induces the closed conformation, and the ligand is trapped at the interface between the two domains, according to what has been termed the "venus fly-trap" mechanism  <cit> . the structural analysis of gbpa in complex with gssg has identified many specific interactions between gssg and its cognate sbp that may be helpful in the delineation of the entire gbpa family  <cit> . the discovery that gbpa mediates glutathione transport in h. influenza came as a complete surprise as this protein was previously thought to be a heme-binding protein, accordingly annotated hbpa, and was implicated as a binding-platform for heme  <cit> . nonetheless, gbpa does bind hemin, albeit weakly with an apparent kd of  <dig> μm  <cit> , and a possible role for gbpa and dppbcdf in heme acquisition has been described  <cit> . in this regard, gbpa presents itself as a good example of the high degree of substrate promiscuity especially common among cluster  <dig> sbps  <cit> .

in light of our recent report on the functional reannotation of hbpa to gbpa  <cit> , the present study was designed to elucidate further and refine this emerging sbp subfamily of glutathione-binding proteins and to clarify the roles of such proteins in glutathione and heme acquisition. gbpa homologs were identified employing blast and their clustering in the novel gbpa family was established based on structure-based motif fingerprinting. to ascertain the gbpa family functionally, we subsequently explored the ligand preferences of five representative gbpa homologous proteins. as the gbpa from h. influenzae is lipidated in vivo, we also incorporated in our test protein set gbpa homologous sequences that were not preceded by a peptidase ii modifiable leader peptide, thereby providing the opportunity to uncover lipidation-dependent functional effects. our studies indicate that gbpa family members are exclusively found in the gram-negative pasteurellaceae, where they have evolved by gene duplication from a canonical dppa sequence to prime the transport of physiologically useful forms of glutathione. our data on the other hand do not support a general role for gbpa family proteins in heme acquisition. finally, a phylogentically distinct cluster of gbpa homologues was identified, which appears to lack binding capacity not only for glutathione and other peptide ligands, but heme as well, thus casting a new twist in the possible substrate preferences of gbpa-like proteins.

RESULTS
in order to delineate the gbpa family of sbp proteins and to identify gbpa homologs with signal peptidase ii modifiable leader peptides, we blasted the gbpahi sequence against all available microbial databases in june  <dig> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/genom_table.cgi. we found gbpa homologs in  <dig> different species, all of which belong to the pasteurellaceae, and more than half of these sequences  were predicted lipoproteins by the lipop  <dig>  server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/lipop/. a survey of the top  <dig> homologs furthermore uncovered a number of established and predicted dppa proteins as well as several pasteurellaceae-unique sequences that on first sight neither belong to the dppa-family, nor to the gbpa-family and that are all annotated as heme-binding proteins . we will refer to these proteins with the affiliation hbpa <dig>  these hbpa <dig> sequences were found in  <dig> species, h. parasuis, m. haemolyticus, and a. pleuropneumoniae, all of which also contained a gbpa. the identified gbpa, dppa, and hbpa <dig> proteins share at least 50% sequence identity, with the gbpa/hbpa <dig> couples being the closest relatives  and the dppa/hbpa <dig> couples having the most distant relationship. a phylogentic analysis using the geneious  <dig> . <dig> package http://www.geneious.com led to a striking delineation of these homologs into three clades, as supported by bootstrap resampling . interestingly, most dppa proteins homologous to gbpahi are also found within the pasteurellaceae, strongly suggesting that glutathione-specific gbpa proteins evolved paralogously in the pasteurellaceae lineage from their canonical dppa dipeptide-binder. high-resolution crystal structures of liganded gbpa  and dppa  representatives have uncovered key ligand contact residues that provide family-specific signature sequences  <cit> . we highlighted such sequence fingerprints in a cut-and-spliced version of a hierarchical clustering-based multiple sequence alignment http://multalin.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/ of the gbpas' blast top  <dig> homologs shown in figure  <dig>  this analysis correlates strongly with the three clade separation, and reveals a strict conservation of  <dig> out of  <dig>  and  <dig> out of  <dig> of the active site residues in the demarcated gbpa and dppa clade, respectively. furthermore, figure  <dig> highlights the versatility of the dpp-fold whereby a handful of key mutations on either side of the binding interface has led to a ligand-preference switch from a dipeptide to a disulfide bridge containing hexapeptide. accordingly, the signature sequence for the gbpa family is more extended and comprises more residues than that of the dppa family.

interestingly, the hbpa <dig> clade diverged significantly from both the gbpa and dppa signature sequences. in fact, some of the strictly conserved residues that contact the ligand's charged n- and c-termini in either the gbpa or the dppa family are replaced by physicochemically dissimilar residues in the hbpa <dig> sequences thereby virtually disrupting critical ligand-stabilizing salt bridges . the ligand specificity of the hbpa <dig> clade is therefore difficult to predict, but it is highly unlikely that glutathione or dipeptides are the natural molecular cargos. given the auxotrophic nature of pasteurellaceae for heme and the fact that the dpp-architecture is a proven hemin-binding scaffold  it is tempting to speculate that hbpa <dig> proteins may play a role in heme transport.

to document the heme-binding characteristics of the gbpa family, to verify the role of the posttranslational  <dig> -diacylglycerol-modification of gbpa proteins in terms of glutathione and heme binding, and to establish the ligand-preferences of the hbpa <dig> family, we selected in addition to gbpahi yet another gbpa lipoprotein ,  <dig> non-lipoprotein gbpa's , and  <dig> hbpa <dig> proteins , for further study.

in a previous report, we had employed a hemin-binding assay based on native-page to show that gbpahi has a physiologically irrelevant affinity for hemin  <cit> . to probe heme-binding among our protein test panel, the purified recombinant soluble forms of the test proteins were subjected to our native-page-based assay in the presence and absence of  <dig>  mm hemin . as this hemin concentration approaches its kd-value, the gbpahi band splits up, with about half of it migrating faster because of complexation with hemin  and heme-staining with  <dig> ', <dig> '-tetramethylbenzidine/h2o2). although all tested proteins displayed the split migration pattern, the fraction of the faster running hemin-complexed bands is much lower compared to that of gbpahi and therefore indicative of an extremely low affinity for hemin. these results strongly suggest that heme-binding is not a general feature of the gbpa and hbpa <dig> family. notably, the second best binder of hemin is gbpaap, the other lipoprotein in our test panel.

a fluorescence-based thermal shift assay  was subsequently employed to screen for potential allocrites. the set of putative ligands amounted to  <dig> different ligands comprising of glutathione, some of its derivatives, and already established allocrites of the type  <dig> sbp superfamily such as di- and tripeptides, δ-aminolevulinic acid, nickel, and proline-betaine. the temperature-induced changes in relative fluorescence of  <dig> μg of test protein as a function of candidate ligands at  <dig> mm were recorded and those ligands that significantly affected the transition midpoint temperature  of the apo-form  are shown in table  <dig> as a function of the corresponding Δtm-values . our analysis revealed an affinity of all tested gbpa proteins for : gssg > gsh > s-methylglutathione ≅ glutathione-cysteine disulfide. in addition, gbpahp and gbpapm also showed a minor but significant tm-shift in the presence of the bulky s-alkylated glutathione derivatives, s-hexylglutathione and s-decylglutathione. although certain s-modifications were tolerated, fragments of glutathione such as γ-glutamylcysteine or cysteinylglycine or a slightly elongated form of glutathione  did not influence the melting behavior of any of the tested proteins, showing that the gbpa family carries a specificity for the glutathione backbone. interestingly, in contrast to the notion that increasingly bulkier s-alkylations abrogate binding, the disulfide of glutathione with another glutathione molecule or with cysteine appear to be good allocrites for the entire gbpa family, strongly suggesting that the gbpa-fold evolved to bind these types of glutathione derivatives in vivo. this observation makes sense as many pasteurellaceae are glutathione as well as cysteine auxotrophs and glutathione-cysteine disulfide reaches levels similar to those of glutathione in human plasma .

ainteracting ligands are identified by means of the respective Δtm-values, the apparent tm-differences in °c for the ligand-protein complexes relative to the uncomplexed proteins. a negative sign indicates ligands for which the Δtm is smaller than  <dig> °c.

isothermal titration calorimetry  was subsequently used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constants for the interaction of our gbpa proteins with gssg, gsh, and s-me-gsh. typical itc thermograms, showing the raw and integrated data for the interaction of gbpahp with these allocrites are shown in figure  <dig>  and all respective calculated kd-values are summarized in table  <dig>  except for gbpahp, the ranking of binding strength according to the thermal shift Δtm-values was recapitulated by the itc-derived kd-values. notably, affinities for the natural allocrites, gssg and gsh, varied 200-fold, and for the artificial ligand s-me-gsh ~ 400-fold among the selected gbpa-family members, with gbpahi being the worst binder for all tested putative ligands. interestingly, gbpa from h. influenzae, which naturally exists in a membrane anchored form, takes a unique position within the gbpa-family as the best binder of hemin, and the worst binder of glutathione. on the other hand, the soluble form of the predicted lipoprotein gbpa from a. pleuropneumoniae displays affinities for the tested glutathione derivatives that are similar to the two non-lipoprotein gbpa's . therefore, membrane-anchoring of gbpa proteins appears not to impose any functional implications. interestingly, the best hemin-binders from our test proteins were the lipoprotein gbpas , amongst which the one of h. influenzae was shown to be biologically significant for heme acquisition  <cit> . therefore, membrane-anchoring may influence the role of gbpas in heme acquisition by increasing their intrinsic affinity for hemin. nonetheless, gbpa-mediated heme import appears to be of minor importance under laboratory conditions as yet another family  <dig> sbp, the antimicrobial peptide binder sapa, has recently been shown to be essential for heme utilization by iron-starved nontypeable h. influenzae cells  <cit> .

avalues were taken from ref.  <cit> .

the lack of conservation of consensus sequence fingerprints important for ligand-binding by gbpa- and dppa-family proteins  had already suggested that the hbpa <dig> proteins in our test set would fail to bind the glutathione- and dipeptide-types of ligands. indeed, our thermofluor analyses showed that none of the two hbpa <dig> proteins under study were able to interact with any of the tested type  <dig> sbp superfamily allocrites . because of the possibility that the hbpa <dig> proteins would co-purify with their natural ligands, as observed for some other structurally characterized sbp's, such as e. g. the cysteine-complexed cjaa from campylobacter jejuni  <cit>  or the oligopeptide-binder appa from bacillus subtilis in complex with a nonapeptide  <cit> , we sought to determine the crystal structure of hbpa2hp hoping to elucidate an interaction with a possible ligand. the crystal structure of hbpa2hp was determined to  <dig>  Å resolution by maximum-likelihood molecular replacement . the structure reveals the two-lobe α/β-fold architecture and β-strand topology typical for sbp-like proteins, and is essentially identical to that of the structurally characterized gbpa and dppa proteins. crystallographic refinement and exhaustive examination of residual difference electron density maps failed to provide any evidence for a bound ligand to hbpa <dig>  moreover, the n- and c-terminal domains were opened by about  <dig> degrees with respect to the gssg-bound gbpa and glycylleucine-bound dppa reported previously  <cit>  , again indicating we crystallized apo-hbpa2hp. importantly, the crystal structure of hbpa2hp offers an explanation for its inability to bind peptide-like ligands. figure 5b shows a structural superposition of residues of the gbpa ligand-binding site with only those corresponding residues in hbpa2hp of which the physicochemical properties are significantly different as revealed by our sequence alignments . this analysis focuses on the c-terminal lobe, because it comprised the majority of the ligand-interacting residues as shown by the gbpahp-gssg complex  <cit>  , and due to the fact that it is believed to drive formation of the sbp-ligand-encounter complex  <cit> . out of the  <dig> gssg-contacting residues,  <dig> were not strictly conserved in hbpa2hp, i.e. a380p, s430t, and d432r. all of these residues appear to be critical for gssg-binding by gbpahp: the peptide-nitrogen of a <dig> hydrogen-bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of glyi of one of the glutathione legs ; the d <dig> side chain carboxylate forms a salt bridge with the amino terminus of gs-i as well as h-bonds with the side chain hydroxyl groups of y <dig> and y <dig> thereby positioning these residues for favorable hydrophobic interactions, the side chain of s <dig> is involved in h-bonding with both the carboxylate- and amino-groups of the γ-glutamyl-moiety of gs-i  <cit> . the structural superposition in figure 5b shows that s <dig> and d <dig> in the hbpa2hp structure occupy the exact same position as the corresponding active site residues in gbpahp. at the same time, a <dig> takes a slightly different position which would be expected due to the elimination of the special structural role of a proline residue in maintaining loop structure at this position. our structural analysis offers direct evidence that the a380p, s430t, and d432r substitutions would be grossly incompatible with gsh and gssg binding as they would abolish electrostatic, h-bonding and hydrophobic interactions contributions critical for binding of such ligands. a similar analysis, this time against e. coli dppa, shows that r <dig> in hbpa2hp takes the exact same position as the active site residue d <dig> in e. coli dppa, a residue that makes a salt-bridge with the amino-terminus of the bound dipeptide ligand. thus, r <dig> would prevent dipeptide ligand binding. finally, we note that the inability of the hbpa <dig> proteins to interact with either glutathione or dipeptides is correlated by looking at the interspecies occurrence:  <dig> out of  <dig> species with hbpa <dig> genes also carry genes for both a gbpa and a dppa family member.

CONCLUSIONS
we here have provided a biochemical and phylogenetic delineation of the gbpa-family of glutathione-binding proteins. we showed that the gbpa proteins likely evolved exclusively within the pasteurellaceae lineage by gene duplication from an already present dipeptide-binding protein, dppa, thereby explaining our previously reported functional annotation of gbpa proteins as periplasmic binding proteins that prime glutathione import to the cytoplasm via the cognate dpp-abc transporter  <cit> . gbpa proteins are specific for the glutathione backbone, but can tolerate s-modifications to different extends. this slightly promiscuous behavior probably resulted from the evolutionary tailoring of the gbpa scaffold to also accommodate useful disulfides of glutathione, such as gssg and glutathione cysteine disulfide. although gbpa proteins were formerly known as heme-binding proteins, an important implication of our work concerns the awareness that they clearly do not have a general role in heme acquisition. apart from gbpa and/or dppa representatives, some pasteurellaceae also carry the genetic information for a close, although phylogenetically distinct homolog, which we have termed hbpa <dig> in the present paper. because we were unable to identify a molecular interaction partner for these paralogous hbpa <dig> proteins, their in vivo role will have to await further study. in any case, the current annotation as "heme-binding protein or hbpa" for hbpa2-family members is clearly inaccurate and databases should be rectified accordingly .
