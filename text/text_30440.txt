BACKGROUND
while recent advances in dna sequencing technology have greatly facilitated genomic analysis, quantitative and reproducible analysis of animal behavior is expected to further promote data-driven behavioral genetics . caenorhabditis elegans is a model organism for which various research resources are available, including a high-quality genome sequence, highly curated and integrated databases, and a complete neuronal wiring diagram . several systems that automatically track and video-record individual worms are already available for ethological studies . some of these systems record not only movement trajectories but also time-series postural images of individual worms. although these trajectories and postures are not independent from each other  <cit> , perturbations at the molecular and cellular levels influence the latter more directly than the former.

computational methods for analyzing c. elegans time-series postural data are still under development. a classic approach is to search given datasets for predefined postural patterns or behavioral parameters; however, such an approach suffers from a lack of objectivity or the ability to identify novel characteristics  <cit> . a more systematic approach is to use unsupervised machine learning to find frequently appearing stretches or “behavioral motif” de novo within time-series postures. using this approach, brown et al. analyzed  <dig> movies of  <dig> mutant strains and detected  <dig> c. elegans behavioral motifs  <cit> . a feature vector for each individual worm was then calculated based on the detected behavioral motifs, and clustering of the strains using these feature vectors successfully grouped mutant strains in which the responsible genes have related biological functions  <cit> . szigeti et al. developed another method for finding behavioral motifs based on spline mixture models and identified motifs corresponding to turning or passive behaviors  <cit> .

an alternative systematic approach for analyzing time-series postural data is to quantify transition frequencies between “postural states”. in this approach, worm postures are clustered based on similarities between postures and the obtained clusters are defined as postural states. whereas the behavioral motif approach detects atypical behaviors as continuous stretches, the postural state approach detects those that rather reflect worms’ prompt reaction, which might reflect their decision-making criteria, for instance. as a pioneering work, schwarz et al. used k-means clustering to bin worm postures, and observed condition-specific state transition patterns  <cit> . however, the factors underlying atypical worm postural movement patterns were not sufficiently dissected, particularly because postures and transition patterns between them should not be independent from each other.

here, we applied the gaussian mixture model -based binning method  <cit>  to time-series postural data for  <dig> c. elegans strains to quantify their transition frequencies between postural states, and revealed that the occurrence patterns of the postural states and the transition patterns among these states have a relationship as expected. in addition, we discovered several strains that exhibit atypical transition patterns that cannot be fully explained by their occurrence patterns of postural states. we also propose that elimination of inactivity periods where the postural change speed is nearly equal to zero, and overall acceleration of postural change speed can explain the behavioral phenotypes of strains with very atypical transition patterns.

methods
dataset preparation
the original dataset was obtained from the c. elegans behavioral database  <cit>  and consisted of data from  <dig> hermaphroditic individual worms of  <dig> strains freely crawling on agar plate surfaces with food. the  <dig> strains comprised  <dig> wild-type  and  <dig> n2-derived mutant strains. to concisely represent their postures, we adopted four-dimensional eigenworm vectors  <cit>  that were pre-calculated in the original dataset. in brief, an eigenworm vector was calculated from each image frame of a video-recorded individual worm as follows. first, the midline of the worm body was obtained by image processing, and  <dig> angles were measured at regular intervals along the midline . second, the  <dig> angles were normalized to obtain a mean value of zero to ignore the general orientation of the body. third, the normalized  <dig> values were projected onto four dimensions that were defined by four eigenvectors explaining 92% of the overall variability of worm postures  <cit> . such an eigenvector representation of animal shapes is widely accepted for analyzing animal behavior  <cit> .
fig.  <dig> measurement and eigenworm representation of worm postures. the left panel shows a picture of a wild-type n <dig> worm; its contour and midline are highlighted. this picture was taken from the c. elegans behavioral database  <cit> . in total,  <dig> angles were measured at regular intervals along the midline and projected onto the four-dimensional eigenworm space after normalization




to ensure that the data were consistent, we excluded data from any individual worm whose video length was not between  <dig> and  <dig> seconds or whose eigenworm vectors were missing in more than 40% of the entire frames . missing eigenworm vectors in the remaining dataset were linearly interpolated using values from the two immediately flanking frames . because various frame rates were used in the original dataset , we downsampled all data to five frames per second. finally, by excluding data for any strain for which less than five different individuals were available, we obtained time-series eigenworm vector data for  <dig> individual worms from  <dig> strains .

probabilistic binning of c. elegans postures into postural states
to represent any eigenworm vector by discrete postural states in a probabilistic manner, we used a gmm-based binning method  <cit> . this method represents each four-dimensional eigenworm vector by a probabilistic mixture of multiple gaussian distributions. first, because the total number of image frames in the entire dataset was too large, we randomly sampled 1% of the frames  for parameter estimation. second, we plotted the eigenworm vectors of all frames and fit the four-dimensional gmm to the pooled distribution consisting of  <dig>  data points. the gmm parameters were estimated by the factorized asymptotic bayes  algorithm  <cit> . the fab algorithm is similar to the conventional expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting gmm  <cit>  but allows automatic estimation of the numbers of mixture components based on factorized information criterion   <cit> . unlike conventional information criteria such as akaike information criterion and bayesian information criterion, fic can be applied to the inference of mixture models with theoretical justification. the fab algorithm eliminates components if their mixture ratios are smaller than a given threshold ε after the e-step that is modified from that of the conventional expectation-maximization algorithm. the source codes of fab-gmm algorithm are available at https://github.com/fukunagatsu/fab-gmm. we set ε= <dig> , <dig> , or  <dig>  using initial parameter sets estimated by the k-means++ algorithm  <cit>  with k= <dig> , or  <dig>  respectively . third, after the convergence of the fab algorithm, each gaussian distribution component was regarded as a postural state. we obtained  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> postural states when ε was  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. finally, for each frame , the responsibility of each gaussian distribution component for explaining its eigenworm vector was calculated using the estimated parameters. as a result, a posture of any individual i at any frame f was represented by a k-dimensional nonnegative vector r
i,f=t, where k is the number of postural states, each element represents the responsibility of each state, and ∑k=1kri,f,k= <dig> 

for comparison, we also adopted the k-means clustering, which not probabilistically but deterministically bins any eigenworm vector to a single state. first, the same set of 1% frames were selected and their eigenworm vectors were plotted to the four-dimensional space in the same manner. second, k-means clustering was applied to the pooled distribution. the model parameters were estimated by the lloyd algorithm  <cit>  with initial parameters estimated by k-means++ algorithm  <cit> , where k was set to  <dig>  or  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> . third, after the convergence of the lloyd algorithm, a centroid of each cluster was regarded as a postural state. finally, for each frame , its eigenworm vector was binned to the closest postural state. note that, any worm posture was represented by a vector r
i,f as in the case of the gmm-based method, but it was an integer vector .

evaluation of binning methods
in this work, we assumed that the postures of individual worms belonging to the same strain should be statistically more similar than the postures of worms belonging to different strains. thus, if worm postures are represented more properly by the postural states, the relative state occurrence frequencies of an individual i,ri=1f∑f=1fri,f, where f is the number of frames, are expected to be more similar between individuals of the same strain than those of different strains. the gmm-based method and k-means clustering with three and four different parameters, respectively, were compared based on this rationale.

let s
i be a set of individuals that belong to the same strain as i except i, and s¯i be a set of randomly selected individuals such that si∩s¯i=∅,i∉s¯i, and |si|=|s¯i|, where |s| represents the number of individuals belonging to s. for every individual i, we calculated the mean divergences of the relative state occurrence frequencies against s
i and s¯i as follows: 
 Δintrari=1|si|∑j∈sid 
 Δinterri=1|s¯i|∑j∈s¯id  where d is the jensen-shannon divergence, which is a measure of divergence between two probability distributions  <cit> . note that r
i is a normalized vector and can be regarded as a probability distribution. then, for each strain, we tested the hypothesis that Δ
intra
r
i of all individuals that belong to that strain are statistically smaller than Δ
inter
r
i of them by a one-sided wilcoxon-mann-whitney test. the test was repeated against all strains, and the benjamini-hochberg approach was used to control the false-discovery rates of multiple testing   <cit> .

discovery of strains showing wild-type n2-like postures but atypical transition patterns
for each individual i, the relative transition frequencies between postural states were represented by a k×k matrix t
i whose element representing the transition from a state k to l is 
 ti,k,l=1f−1∑f=1f−1ri,f,kri,f+ <dig> l 


for each strain s, the relative state occurrence frequency r
i and relative state transition frequency t
i were averaged for its individuals to obtain r
s and t
s, respectively. with the exception of the wild-type n <dig> strain, we calculated the divergences of each strain from wild-type n <dig> as follows: 
 Δn2rs=d 
 Δn2ts=d  where d is the jensen-shannon divergence. note that t
i can also be regarded as a probability distribution. for example, a large Δ
n2
t
s indicates that strain s has a state transition pattern that is very different from that of wild-type n <dig> 

next, we conducted linear regression to investigate relationships between a dependent variable Δ
n2
t
s and an explanatory variable Δ
n2
r
s. then, we detected strains showing atypical transition patterns using standardized residuals  from the estimated linear model. to control the false-discovery rates of multiple testing, we used the benjamini-hochberg approach .

analysis of factors underlying atypical state transition patterns
to reveal factors underlying the atypical transition patterns, we created artificial n <dig> strains in silico by modifying the eigenworm data for the wild-type n <dig> strain and determined if these artificial n <dig> strains reproduced the atypical state transition frequencies of strains that showed atypical transition patterns. specifically, we focused on the effects of eliminating inactivity periods and accelerating the average postural change speed. to remove inactivity periods from wild-type n <dig>  we excluded any frame for which the euclidean distance of the eigenworm vectors between that and the previous frame was smaller than a threshold α. to change the postural change speed as a whole, we removed frames at regular intervals to simulate movement of β-times accelerated wild-type n <dig>  when β= <dig> , for every three consecutive frames, the eigenworm vectors of the second and third frames were replaced with the averaged vector. when β= <dig>  every second frame was removed. because all strains that showed atypical transition patterns were faster than wild-type n <dig> on average, only acceleration was considered here . for each strain s, the parameters α and β were selected to minimize 
 deigenworm speed=∫x|fan2−fs|dx  where f
an <dig> and f
s are the cumulative distributions of the instantaneous postural change speed  of the artificial n <dig> strain and s, respectively.

then, we calculated r

RESULTS
evaluation of binning methods and parameters
the postures of each of the  <dig> individual worms belonging to  <dig> strains were represented by time-series four-dimensional eigenworm vectors. every eigenworm vector was binned to postural states by the gmm-based method and k-means clustering with three and four parameters, respectively. then, we determined if the relative state occurrence frequencies were more similar between worms of the same strain than between worms of different strains. the number of strains for which the null hypothesis of no difference with benjamini-hochberg’s q< <dig>  was rejected is shown in table  <dig>  overall, the gmm-based method detected greater numbers of such strains than k-means clustering, indicating that less postural information was lost during binning in the former than in the latter. although the parameter selection did not have a strong impact on the results, k= <dig> and ε= <dig>  were the best parameters for the k-means clustering and gmm-based methods, respectively. among the  <dig> strains that exhibited significance by k-means-clustering with k= <dig>  only ten were missed by the gmm-based method with ε= <dig>  . therefore, the gmm-based method with ε= <dig>  was adopted for postural state binning in the following analyses.

for example, three mutant strains, unc- <dig>  unc- <dig>  and unc- <dig>  exhibited the largest divergences of both values from wild-type n <dig> . the unc- <dig> gene encodes an ether-a-go-go-related k
+ channel homolog, and the strain in which this gene has a gain-of-function mutation has been reported to show extremely lethargic behavior  <cit> . the unc- <dig> strain is a mutant of a stomatin-like-protein gene and has also been reported to show very slow behavior  <cit> . the large deviations of the postural state occurrence and transition frequencies of these two mutant strains likely reflect their exceptionally inactive phenotypes. the unc- <dig> strain features a gain-of-function mutation of a subunit gene of a voltage-insensitive cation leak channel and exhibits coiled postures  <cit> . to reveal what postures are specific in this strain, we calculated the fold change between r
unc− <dig> k and r
n <dig> k for each postural state k and detected over-represented and under-represented postures in unc- <dig> . these results showed that the unc- <dig> strain tends to take more “c-shaped” but less “s-shaped” postures compared to the wild-type n <dig> strain.

identification of strains exhibiting atypical transition patterns
as shown in fig.  <dig>  although most strains strongly followed the positive linear correlation trend, several strains did not. we identified seven strains exhibiting atypical transition patterns that were significantly deviated from expectation . only these seven strains showed z-values larger than  <dig>  .

the two strains with the largest z-values, npr- <dig> and npr- <dig>  are mutants of neuropeptide receptor  genes. as it is known that npr- <dig> is expressed in ventral nerve cord motor neuron, it is reasonable that these neuropeptide receptor genes have roles in controlling postural movement  <cit> . however, notably, other npr mutant strains did not show large z-values, even though npr- <dig> and npr- <dig> are neither the closest paralogs in the npr gene family nor highly identical in sequence  . because r
s and t
s of these two strains were most similar to each other among all strains , the npr- <dig> and npr- <dig> genes were suggested to have closely related functions at the behavioral level regardless of their different evolutionary origins at the sequence level.

the egl- <dig> and eat- <dig> genes encode components of heterotrimeric g-protein signaling pathways. loss of egl- <dig> function depresses the behavioral activity of c. elegans, whereas eat- <dig> negatively regulates egl- <dig>  <cit> . because the egl- <dig> and eat- <dig> mutant strains in this study have gain-  and loss-of-function alleles , respectively  <cit> , their similar, active behavioral phenotypes are consistent with previous reports. indeed, r
s and t
s from the egl- <dig> and eat- <dig> strains were most similar to each other.


lon- <dig> encodes a glypican-family protein of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and its mutant was reported to have a longer body than that of wild-type n <dig>  <cit> . a previous study reported that lon- <dig> was one of the worst-fit mutants in the eigenworm representation  <cit> . although it is not clear why Δ
n2
r
s of lon- <dig> is not very large, the poor fitting of the eigenworm representation may have resulted in atypical transition patterns of this strain.

ed <dig> and ju <dig> are non-n <dig> wild-type strains. c. elegans population genomics studies revealed that n <dig> strains acquired gain-of-function mutations in npr- <dig> during laboratory domestication  <cit> , and ed <dig> and ju <dig> have a lower activity allele in npr- <dig>  the large z-values of these two strains may be caused by this low npr- <dig> activity.

analysis of factors underlying atypical state transition patternsa presents the distributions of the instantaneous postural change speed of wild-type n <dig> and the six strains that exhibited atypical transition patterns. note that lon- <dig> was excluded here because the earlier stage of eigenworm representation could be problematic for this strain. overall, all six strains exhibited faster postural change speeds than those of wild-type n <dig>  only wild-type n <dig> had a mode of the postural change speed at approximately  <dig>  , at which four of the other strains also had small “shoulders” . such a small speed value indicates that the individuals are under inactivity periods, which may correspond to quiescence worm behavior  <cit> . we also observed several strains that retain this mode of postural change speed at approximately  <dig>  but have different distribution shapes from that of wild-type n <dig> .

on the basis of these observations, we investigated whether artificial elimination of the inactivity periods and overall acceleration of postural change speed from wild-type n <dig> could reproduce the state transition patterns of these six strains without significantly altering the state occurrence frequencies. in time-series sequence representations of postural states, inactivity periods are represented by stretches of identical or similar state. because inactivity periods likely do not occur only at specific postural states , the elimination of inactivity periods would change the state transition frequencies while modestly preserving the state occurrence frequencies. for the acceleration of postural change speed, for example, two-fold acceleration of a state sequence aabbccaa... into abca... as a whole will also change the state transition frequencies by preserving the state occurrence frequencies.

artificial n <dig> strain data were created in silico by removing inactivity periods with threshold α and accelerating β-fold as a whole from the time-series eigenworm data for wild-type n <dig>  for each of the six strains, we chose the best parameters from α= <dig> , <dig> ,…, <dig>  and β= <dig> , <dig>  by examining whether the postural change speed distributions of the artificial n <dig> strains fit those of each of the six strains . finally, we investigated whether the artificial n <dig> strains reproduced not only the distributions of the instantaneous postural change speed but also the postural state occurrence and transition frequencies of the six strains. all z
a values became substantially smaller than the original z-values, and these values decreased to the level that was not significantly different from expectation . in other words, the atypical state transition frequencies of these four mutant strains can be explained almost entirely by the lack of inactivity periods and overall acceleration of the postural change speed.

discussion
in this study, we used the gmm-based method for probabilistically binning worm postures into a finite number of postural states and revealed an apparent relationship between the postures and transition patterns of c. elegans strains. the superior binning performance of the gmm-based method reflects the fact that time-series postures of any individual are distributed along a single trajectory in the four-dimensional eigenworm space because the postures of continuous frames should be similar to each other. thus, a worm must adopt intermediate postures while changing its posture from one postural state to another. deterministic binning of such intermediate postures inevitably loses information or introduces noise to the representation of worm behavior. the case of the lon- <dig> strain in this study also indicates the importance of preserving information during the computational analysis of animal behavior, although the difficulty in this case occurred during the eigenworm representation. the strong relationship between the postural state occurrence and transition frequencies offers two important suggestions for worm postural movement analysis: a significant part of postural movement variations can be evaluated solely by examining postures without temporal information, and the effects of using different postures must be taken into account in postural movement analysis.

several strains that exhibited atypical transition patterns among postural states were identified. surprisingly, for the six strains that showed the most atypical postural movement, merely eliminating the inactivity periods and accelerating the postural change speed as a whole nearly reproduced their atypical transition patterns. while quantification of the transition frequencies between postural states is a powerful approach for computationally analyzing animal behavior, our results demonstrate that even very atypical state transition patterns can result from simple factors. analyses of inactivity periods and postural change speeds both require consideration of time duration; the compression of state time duration abolishes their effects in the analysis  <cit> . to effectively detect strains that show truly interesting behavior, e.g., strains whose neural circuits encode special decision-making criteria, computational analyses of animal behavior must be accompanied by evaluation of the effects of more “trivial” factors such as overall change in speed . the c. elegans behavioral database also contains various behavioral data such as dorsal/ventral orientations, velocities, and trajectories during worm movement. using these additional datasets, we may dissect factors that underlie interesting phenotypes more deeply, for example, effects of dorsal/ventral biases in postural change patterns and/or relationships between postural change patterns and movement trajectories.

our analysis also revealed that the npr- <dig> and npr- <dig> genes have closely related functions that were unpredictable by sequence homology, the most basic principle in this genomic era. many studies have conducted functional analyses of npr- <dig> , but few studies have focused on npr- <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we envision that existing knowledge about npr- <dig> will substantially accelerate future functional analyses of npr- <dig> based on the present result.

in this study, divergence of the state occurrence and transition frequencies from the wild-type n <dig> strain was examined. although this would make sense for the analysis of n2-derived mutant strains, comparison among different wild-type strains can also be done by selecting another strain as a reference. we expect that the linear correlation trend between the state occurrence and transition frequencies will be recovered regardless of the reference strain choice; however, for example, it would also be of interest to select strains that have specific evolutionary context or strains that show characteristic behavior .

CONCLUSIONS
although more than a decade has passed since the genomes of many model organisms were sequenced, significant numbers of genes remain functionally uncharacterized. systematically deciphering their functions beyond straightforward sequence homology analysis is one of the most important goals in computational biology today, where an advantage of bioimage informatics for functional analysis is the ability of this method to directly evaluate phenotypes . finally, it should be noted that genome-editing technologies are enabling rapid construction of genetically engineered animal strains  <cit> . bioimage-informatic analysis of their behaviors will, for example, contribute to the identification of novel genes responsible for neurological disease. we emphasize that further development of computational methods and accumulation of technical knowledge will be critical to promote this emerging field.
