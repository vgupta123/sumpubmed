BACKGROUND
reliable annotation of cdna sequences is of great concern to research groups working with non-model organisms, in particular in the emerging field of ecological genomics  <cit> . thus, many groups still make use of sanger sequencing technologies in order to obtain long reads which can be reliably annotated  <cit> . however, recently next generation sequencing  techniques have become a valuable tool for transcriptome analysis. nearly all de novo transcriptome sequencing projects to date using ngs have employed the 454/roche system which provides considerably longer read lengths compared to other ngs methods at the time  <cit> . solexa/illumina transcriptome studies on the other hand have been limited to species with an available genome to use as a reference sequence for read assembly  <cit> . recently gibbons et al.  <cit>  created non-normalized aedes aegypti and a. gambiae est-libraries by solexa/illumina sequencing. although their estimated coverage of the transcriptome was low , their assembled contigs were very accurate and informative  <cit> . they concluded that their obtained sequence length , together with the vast amount of reads, made this method suitable for contig assembly from transcriptome data in non-model organisms. similarly, the first de novo transcriptome assembly paper based on the first generation of  <dig> sequencing technology achieved relatively good assembly performance, with a large number of positively identified contigs in blast comparisons versus several insect databases, and reads that were on average only 110bp long  <cit> . together these two studies suggest that as the solexa/illumina technology gets closer to 100bp in length, this technology could generate suitable data for a high quality transcriptome assembly with nearly  <dig> times the coverage for roughly 1/ <dig> the current cost of a given 454/roche run. here we demonstrate for the first time the use of solexa/illumina data for de novo assembly on a non-model species, but also that short read assembly algorithms first need to improve to make this the platform of choice.

ngs platforms present an important tradeoff between the number of fragments sequenced per run and the read length per fragment. a full 454/roche-system run produces around one million reads that have an average read length of about 400bp. systems like solexa/illumina and solid/abi on the other hand produce close to  <dig> million reads per lane, with sequences about 50-100bp long. importantly, a single lane of solexa/illumina sequencing is substantially cheaper than a full  <dig> run. while sequence reads are a valuable resource by itself, short reads are most useful for downstream applications  if they are assembled accurately and efficiently  <cit> . assembly by itself is a commonly overlooked yet critical step, especially when working with ngs data in species without a reference genome  <cit> . while much of the ecological genetics research community is focused upon read lengths, assembly annotation, and snp identification, optimization of data assembly needs more attention. here we address these needs by evaluating the performance of short read assemblers in de novo transcriptome assembly of illumina sequence data without a reference genome.

genomic tools are needed in order to study local adaptation and the adaptive potential of the common pond snail radix balthica. r. balthica is distributed across northern europe and is primarily found in slow flowing water bodies and lakes  <cit> . based on its mixed mating system r. balthica is an interesting study organism to investigate sex allocation, mating strategies, sperm allocation and sexual conflict. recently it has been shown that the distribution of r. balthica is shifting northwards, following temperature shifts caused by global warming  <cit> . while the natural history and distribution of this species render it a good study species, it currently lacks sufficient genomic tools to thoroughly investigate these issues.

here we use the illumina/solexa sequencing platform to sequence a normalized cdna pool from the common pond snail r. balthica. since this platform has not previously been used for de novo transcriptome assembly on a normalized cdna pool, we compare and evaluate the usefulness of three different assemblers. our findings indicate significant differences among assemblers and highlight the potential of using illumina sequencing for non-model species.

RESULTS
illumina sequencing
the normalized rna pool yielded  <dig> , <dig> reads with a median of  <dig> nucleotides in length and a maximum read length of 101bp. the raw sequence data are available at ncbi short read archive . the  <dig> mtdna genome gene sequences of r. balthica were used as reference to calculate transcript coverage, which was found to range between 5x for the nd4l gene up to 989x for coiii, with a mean coverage of 137x. one means to asses normalization success, is to determine whether the average number of ests per ribosomal gene contigs does not exceed 5x the average number of ests for all other contigs  <cit> . using the ngen assembly, there was an average of  <dig> ests per ribosomal gene contig vs.  <dig> for the non-ribosomal genes, indicating that normalization was successful.

indirect contig quality assessment
velvet
the velvet assembly resulted in a total of  <dig>  contigs ranging in size between 61bp to 2257bp, with a mean of 120bp in length . only 9% of these contigs were longer than 200bp. a blastx against the uniprot database with a cutoff value of <e- <dig> yielded  <dig>  putative gene homologies, which resulted in  <dig> unique gene hits  after removing redundant hits . a cutoff value of <e- <dig> decreased the number of hits by over one third to  <dig>  leading to  <dig> unigens, of which  <dig> are above 200bp. a blastn against the refseq invertebrate database with a cutoff value <e- <dig> yielded  <dig> putative gene similarities, which after removing redundant hits resulted in  <dig> unigens . most of these hits matched to the sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus , followed by the sea anemone nematostella vectensis  and hydra magnipapillata . in total, gene homologies were identified across  <dig> different species, of which  <dig> were insect species. applying a cutoff value of <e- <dig> the blastn against the refseq invertebrates database resulted in  <dig> hits of which  <dig> are unigen hits and  <dig> are larger than 200bp. a blastx against biomphalaria glabrata ests yielded  <dig>  hits with <e- <dig> and  <dig> unigens . decreasing the cutoff value to <e- <dig> rendered  <dig> hits with  <dig> unigens and  <dig> longer than 200bp.



oases
the oases assembly with k-mer =  <dig> resulted in a total of  <dig>  contigs with mean length 267bp; k-mer =  <dig> yielded  <dig>  contigs with mean length 309bp . both k-mer lengths resulted in more than  <dig>  contigs larger than 200bp which corresponded to 45% and 53% of the total number of contigs produced. as the blast results of the oases assemblies with different k-mer sizes lead to comparable results, we only discuss the outcome of k-mer size  <dig> in detail . subjecting the contigs to a blastx against the uniprot database with a cutoff value of <e- <dig> yielded  <dig> putative gene homologies, which resulted in  <dig> unigens after removing redundant hits . a blastn against the refseq invertebrate database with a cutoff value <e- <dig> yielded  <dig>  putative gene similarities, which after removing redundant hits resulted in  <dig> unigens . overall homologies to  <dig> different species were detected, of which  <dig> belonged to insect species. in contrast to the velvet results, three mitochondrial homologies belonging to snail species were detected. most of the hits matched to the sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus , followed by hydra magnipapillata , and the sea anemone nematostella vectensis . using a cutoff value of <e- <dig> decreased the number of refseq hits to  <dig> leading to  <dig> unigens, of which  <dig> are above 200bp. applying a cutoff value of <e- <dig> resulted in  <dig> hits of which  <dig> are unigen hits and  <dig> are larger than 200bp. a blastx against biomphalaria glabrata ests yielded  <dig> hits with <e- <dig> and  <dig> unigens . decreasing the cutoff value to <e- <dig> rendered  <dig> hits with  <dig> unigens and  <dig> lager than 200bp.

ngen
the ngen assembly resulted in a total of  <dig>  contigs with mean length 303bp . fifty-five percent of the total contigs were found to be larger than 200bp. figure  <dig> depicts the relationship of average coverage versus contig size. contig length increased with coverage depth and reached an asymptote approximately at an average coverage of about  <dig>  a blastx against the uniprot database with a cutoff value of <e- <dig> yielded  <dig>  putative gene homologies, which resulted in  <dig> unigens after removing redundant hits . using a cutoff value of <e- <dig> resulted in  <dig> hits and  <dig> unigens, of which  <dig> were larger than 200bp. a blastn against the refseq invertebrate database with a cutoff value <e- <dig> yielded  <dig> putative gene similarities, which after removing redundant hits resulted in  <dig> unigens . most of the hits matched to hydra magnipapillata , followed by the sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus , and the tick ixodes scapularis . overall homologies to  <dig> different species were detected, of which  <dig> belonged to insect species, but also  <dig> mitochondrial homologies were found belonging to  <dig> snail species. applying a cutoff value of <e- <dig> decreased the number of refseq hits to  <dig> of which  <dig> are unigen hits and  <dig> were larger than 200bp. a blastx against biomphalaria glabrata ests yielded  <dig>  hits with <e- <dig> and  <dig> unigens . decreasing the cutoff value to <e- <dig> rendered  <dig> hits with  <dig> unigens and  <dig> lager than 200bp.

meta-assembly
the ngen meta-assembly resulted in a total of  <dig>  contigs with mean length  <dig> bp . seventy-three percent of the total contigs were found to be larger than 200bp. a blastx against the uniprot database with a cutoff value of <e- <dig> yielded  <dig>  putative gene homologies, which resulted in  <dig> unigens after removing redundant hits . using a cutoff value of <e- <dig> resulted in  <dig>  hits and  <dig>  unigens, of which  <dig> were larger than 200bp. a blastn against the refseq invertebrate database with a cutoff value <e- <dig> yielded  <dig> putative gene similarities, which after removing redundant hits resulted in  <dig> unigens . most hits were to the sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus , followed by the honey bee apis mellifera , and the jewel wasp nasonia vitripennis . applying a cutoff value of <e- <dig> decreased the number of refseq hits to  <dig> of which  <dig> were unigen hits and  <dig> larger than 200bp. a blastx against biomphalaria glabrata ests yielded  <dig>  hits with <e- <dig> and  <dig> unigens . decreasing the cutoff value to <e- <dig> rendered  <dig>  hits with  <dig> unigens and  <dig> lager than 200bp.

assessing uniprot hits
in the absence of genomic sequence for r. balthica, contigs from the different assemblies were compared among each other. only contigs having uniprot blastx gene hits were used. pairwise comparisons of single gene hits  revealed higher a similarity between the ngen and oases contig sets , than between velvet and any of the latter . this was true for both cutoff values. for example, ngen shared  <dig> hits with oasesk-mer =  <dig> with a cutoff value of <e- <dig>  but only  <dig> with velvet. with a cutoff value of <e- <dig> ngen shared  <dig> hits with oasesk-mer =  <dig>  and  <dig> with velvet.

direct contig quality assessment via mitochondrial genes
assemblies with shorter contigs had more hits against the mtdna genes, with velvet resulting in the highest number of hits , but the shortest total and aligned contig lengths . the meta-assembly had the fewest number of hits and the longest contigs. this relationship is also reflected in the number of contigs with a > 80% identity in their alignment against the mtdna genes, as shorter contigs gave more hits. yet, on the average, the amount each contig assembly covered these mtdna genes was rather similar at around  <dig> to 55% coverage .

summed aligned coverage indicates the sum of the aligned region of contigs across the  <dig> mitochondrial genes. .

contig assembly was also assessed by looking at the average aligned contig length vs. the total contig length . velvet contigs are all very short and show little relationship between increasing contig length and increased alignment length, while this relationship is very clear for the other assemblies. directly related to this is the ratio of the aligned region to the full length of a given contig, plotted against decreasing cutoff value alignment score . all but the meta-assembly show an increase in this ratio as alignment score increases , with the meta-assembly having several outlier contigs with good alignment scores but low ratio. these outliers appear to be chimeric contigs, consisting of two previous contigs incorrectly joined together.

functional annotation of ests
using blast2go , we were able to assign gene ontology classes to  <dig> of the  <dig> blastx hits identical between the ngen and oasesk-mer =  <dig> assemblies. there were a total of  <dig>  gene ontology  terms on all go-levels associated with the  <dig> identified genes. of these, assignments to level two go-terms of the highest order category biological processes made up the majority  followed by cellular components  and molecular function  .

repeat motifs
as shown previously, transcriptome sequences are useful to identify repeat motifs , which due to their high levels of variation are widely used for studies such as genome mapping, parentage analysis, analysis of gene flow and genetic structure . using the program sputnik  <cit> , we identified  <dig> di-, tri-, tetra-, and penta-nucleotide repeats with a minimum repeat length of six, respectively .

discussion
accurate sequence reads and their reliable assembly is crucial for all downstream applications of ngs projects  <cit> . without a reference genome, estimating the number of genes sequenced, their % coverage, and whether they have been assembled correctly is challenging  <cit> . as of the use of ngs continues to increase for non-model organisms, the need for assembly algorithms that perform well in de novo assembly concomitantly increases, especially for the assembly of the short read sequence data for the solexa/illumina platform  <cit> .

the performance of the three short read assemblers  investigated differed greatly. while velvet resulted in the highest number of total contigs, only nine percent of these were larger than 200bp. in contrast, over 50% of the ngen and oases assembled contigs were larger than 200bp. as mapping accuracy increases with increasing contig size  <cit> , we reason that the latter contig sets should resemble higher overall quality. this assumption was strengthened by the results of the blast searches. meta-assembly of the four contig sets resulted in longer contigs, which also result in a higher number of blast hits in most searches.

indirect contig quality assessment
although the velvet assembly had the largest number of contigs and the greatest number of hits against various databases, these are due to the poor assembly of contigs. importantly, our ability to gain this insight is dependent upon the reference database used for blast searches and thus requires careful attention. in the blast comparisons against the uniprot database, the number of unigen hits for the velvet contigs is substantially smaller compared to the other assemblies with a cutoff value of <e- <dig> and also contigs > 200bp . the discrepancy between total and unigen hits derives most probably from the incomplete assembly of contigs by the velvet assembler, resulting in many independent contigs each hitting similar genes, while these are joined together by the other programs and thus constitute single hits to given genes for the ngen and oases assemblies. additionally, the long contig assemblies by the other programs generate more high quality blast hits than those found for velvet . however, blast results against refseq indicate a much greater number of unigen hits by the velvet assembly than the other two methods . this result arises due to the highly redundant nature of the refseq database, as it contains unique sets of genes for numerous species. the refseq database should therefore be used with caution since the number of unique types of genes should not differ significantly from those identified using the uniprot database.

in the blast comparison against a database consisting of a single closely related species, b. glabrata, the ngen assembly resulted in the highest number of unigens, and velvet showing especially poor performance when considering assembled contigs > 200bp in length.

combining all of these assemblies into the meta-assembly resulted in contigs that outperformed the other assemblies in the blastx searches against the uniprot and b. glabrata databases in all but one category.

an additional means of assessing contig assembly performance is to compare the actual hits identified by the different assemblies. similar hits indicate similar contig sequence and accuracy. comparisons were made between assemblies for the blastx search versus the uniprot database , which showed that the proportion of contigs leading to identical gene hits was highest between the ngen and oases contig sets. this again strengthened our interpretation that the quality of the ngen and oases contigs exceeded those of velvet.

direct contig quality assessment
the different contig assemblies were directly assessed by comparing their performance among the  <dig> mitochondrial genes of r. balthica  <cit> . in general, velvet contigs had the highest number of hits against these genes due to these contigs being much shorter. the other assemblies had longer and fewer contigs, which had higher average alignment length, with the meta-assembly showing the best performance . longer contigs had a lower identity match to the mtdna genes, which likely arises due to genetic differences in the samples used for this and the published mtdna genome for r. balthica and potentially sequencing errors . we identified some contigs whose middle region did not resemble the reference sequence and we identified these as assembly errors. in addition, most contigs of the ngen and oases assembly had a 20-30bp extension attached at the beginning of the contig that does not match the mtdna genome. for the ngen assembly, this extension was identified as the illumina sequencing adaptor not removed during filtering due to low identity matching. for the oases contigs we currently lack an explanation for the attachment origin. as the extensions seem to be an almost systematic error, cutting the first 30bp of each contig sequence is one means to solve this problem .

despite these differences, coverage of the mtdna genes was quite similar among the contig assemblies, averaging around  <dig> - 55% . pooling all the contigs from the assemblies covered 79% of the mt genes. thus, even though contigs of the three assemblers overlap to a large extent, each contig set covers some parts which are missed by the others, with at least 24% of the available bp information is not used by any of the three assemblers. we identified  <dig> clusters with  <dig> to  <dig> overlapping, and to a large extent identical velvet contigs. in contrast, among the ngen contigs not more than two contigs with more than 30bp overlap were found. as the two main reasons for insufficient assembly visual inspection of the mt genome alignments revealed insufficient read overlap and missed assemblies, even though identical and sufficient overlap was present. this might be traced back to the use of rna from several pooled individuals, which leads to a larger number of snp variants, and thus might hamper assembly  <cit> . in our study we identified  <dig>  snps per thousand base pairs , similar to the  <dig>  identified snps in the vera et al.  <cit>  study. the estimated number of sequencing errors is almost identical , and results in a sequencing error rate of  <dig> %. obviously snp variation and sequencing errors affect the velvet assembly, but do not appear to influence the other two assemblers. the meta-assembly combined the short velvet snp containing contigs into one, thus largely eliminating redundancy . however, although the meta-assembly decreased the number of contigs from  <dig> to  <dig>  this only resulted in a modest improvement in net coverage compared to velvet .

two other important observations merit discussion. first, contigs giving a hit against the mt genes can be split in two groups. one group of the contigs shows a clear relation between alignment length of the contig to total contig length. the other group consists of contigs that passed the cutoff value <e- <dig>  but only have a very short alignment length to the reference sequence and are therefore due effectively due to random, non-homologous matches . second, while a clear relationship between cutoff value and alignment length is visible for the ngen and oases contigs, both the velvet and meta-assembly contigs have clear outliers that may be assembly errors. these are contigs near the cutoff value with low alignment length, and with very high stringency cutoff values .

comparison to other studies
the number of unigen matches against the unipprot database found in other transcriptome studies of non-model organisms based on the 454/roche platform is roughly similar to the  <dig> meta-assembly matches detected in this study, at a cutoff value of <e- <dig> . however, given our increased sequencing effort compared to previous studies , we expected to identify more genes. previous observations of low blast results in mollusk species can be traced back to three main factors  <cit> . first, the low amount of hits can be explained by the lack of est datasets from mollusk species in genbank  <cit> , and the general paucity of mollusk genetic data compared to insects and fish. second, a large proportion of genes in mollusk species do not share orthologous relationships, but rather represent novel gene families  <cit> . third, the high level of amino acid divergence to other, better studied invertebrate lineages and evolutionary distance to other organisms reduces the probability and quality of blast hits  <cit> . these points highlight the need for more genomic data from molluscs to increase our knowledge and facilitate genomic studies in this phylum.

CONCLUSIONS
here we have demonstrated the first transcriptome assembly of a non-model organism using de novo assembly of solexa/illumina data. however, results strongly depend upon assembly method and the number of high quality contigs is low. as assembly quality increases, including solexa/illumina on the list of sequencing platforms suitable for non-model species will greatly increase the possibilities for future evolutionary studies by decreasing costs and increasing transcriptome coverage. the widely distributed assembler velvet produced by far the highest overall number of contigs. investigating them more closely, however, revealed a large fraction of short contigs, redundant contigs, and a lower number of high quality blast hits in comparison to the other two assemblers. even though contig sequence quality itself revealed to be good, as shown by the direct comparison to r. balthica mt genes, short contigs lead to fragmented coverage. oases contigs closely match the blast results of ngen. thus it appears to be an almost equal alternative, and importantly, freely available. according to our findings the seqman ngen software package performs best for short read assembly. for a cutoff value of <e- <dig> and/or contig length > 200bp the long contigs resulted in an overall highest number of gene hits in different blast searches. the direct comparison to the mt genes showed that ngen contigs almost covered the same amount of bp as velvet, but due to long reads resulted in continuous coverage. however, long contigs also mean the loss of several short informative sequences  and contigs should be screened for unspecific sequence extensions. these drawbacks can be overcome by a meta-assembly of the first-order contigs sets. according to our results meta-assembly leads to longer contigs, higher number of hits in blast searches and should be considered as an additional step in contig assembly.
