BACKGROUND
tuberculosis is an airborne infection caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis. it is estimated that one-third of the world's population is latently infected with m. tuberculosis, and that each year about three million people die of this disease. the emergence of drug-resistant stains is further escalating the threat to public health . in spite of global research efforts, mechanisms underlying pathogenesis, virulence and persistence of m. tuberculosis infection remain poorly understood  <cit> .

m. tuberculosis is a facultative intracellular pathogen that resides within the host macrophages  <cit> . when m. tuberculosis invades host cells, the interface between the host and the pathogen includes membrane- and surface proteins likely to be involved in intracellular multiplication and the bacterial response to host microbicidal processes  <cit> . recently, the cell wall of m. tuberculosis was reported to posses a true outer membrane adding more complexity with regard to bacterial-host interactions and also important information relevant for susceptibility to anti-mycobacterial therapies  <cit> . revealing the composition of the membrane proteome will have an impact on the design and interpretation of experiments aimed at elucidating the translocation pathways for nutrients, lipids, proteins, and anti-mycobacterial drugs across the cell envelope. according to bioinformatic predictions,  <dig> genes  of the m. tuberculosis h37rv genome  <cit> , could encode proteins having between  <dig> and  <dig> transmembrane α-helical domains , which interact with the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. the confirmation of the expression of these genes at the protein level may lead to new therapeutic targets, new vaccine candidates and better serodiagnostic methods.

membrane proteins resolve poorly in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and proteomic profiling of mycobacterial membrane proteins remains a major challenge. their limited solubility in aqueous buffer systems and their relatively low abundance in a background of highly abundant cytoplasmic proteins have yet to be overcome. several studies have reported extraction of membrane- and membrane-associated proteins using centrifugation to obtain purified cell wall and cell membrane fractions for analysis by sodium-dodecyl-sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  in combination with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry   <cit> . common for these studies is pre-isolation of the membrane and cell wall of the bacteria, and application of different washing techniques prior to protein extraction by detergents. in this study, we separated hydrophobic membrane- and membrane-associated proteins directly from sonicated m. tuberculosis h37rv using phase separation with triton x- <dig>  the efficacy of this method was shown with mycobacterium bovis bcg in a previous work  <cit> .

comparison of expressed levels of the identified proteins was performed using the empai  <cit>  this approach relates the number of experimentally observed peptide ions in a given protein to the number of theoretically observable peptides. our results show that among the membrane-and membrane-associated proteins several proteins are present in high relative abundance. using bioinformatic analysis, we also found that the gene sequence encoding rv <dig> which is annotated as a potential lipoprotein in both m. tuberculosis and m. bovis, is shorter in m. bovis and have lost the n-terminal signal peptide and lipobox that mediate the prelipoprotein translocation and its subsequent lipidation that retains it to the membrane.

RESULTS
identification of triton x- <dig> extracted proteins
the aim of this study was to enrich and perform a comprehensive proteomic analysis of membrane- and membrane-associated proteins of the virulent reference strain m. tuberculosis h37rv. for this purpose, the hydrophobic proteins were enriched by lysing whole bacilli followed by phase separation with the triton x- <dig> detergent. after phase separation, the proteins in the lipid phase were precipitated by acetone and separated by sds-page. as shown in figure  <dig> panel a, the lipid phase was quite complex, but appeared to be enriched for certain proteins as compared to the unfractionated crude lysate. in a parallel experiment, and to validate that the protein content in the lipid and aqueous phases were different, proteins from both phases were separated and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes which were developed with polyclonal antibodies against a cell wall fraction of m. bovis bcg . notably, figure  <dig> not only demonstrates that the protein content of the aqueous phase and the lipid phase was different, but also clearly shows that the lipid phase was indeed enriched for cell wall proteins. in order to identify the proteins of the triton x- <dig> detergent fraction, the protein mixture was separated with sds-page , run in duplicate and cut into ten pieces each  and subjected to in-gel digestion by trypsin. the resulting peptides were eluted and analysed by high accuracy mass spectrometry. additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig> illustrates the sequence obtained for ion m/z  <dig>  which was identified by mascot as peptide cgspawdlptvfgpiaitynik from protein rv0932c with a mascot score of  <dig>  such fragmentation data contain a very good coverage of the expected y- and b-series daughter ions plus the presence of other ions which indicates the correct ms/ms assignment such as two highly abundant y-ions of proline . this is very typical for peptides containing proline.

in total,  <dig> proteins extracted with triton x- <dig> were identified from the m. tuberculosis h37rv strain out of which  <dig> are described for the first time. the complete lists of proteins with identified peptides are provided as additional data files . information about the criteria for protein identifications, such as number of peptides matching each protein, scores, identification threshold and peak lists are given in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  identified proteins were categorized according to functional classification . an overview of the number of observed proteins belonging to major groups based on physicochemical properties is shown in figure  <dig>  these groups are described below:

b total number of proteins in each group predicted in the genome.

c number of proteins identified and the ratio compared to the total number of proteins assigned to each functional group.

membrane proteins
according to tmhmm version  <dig> , a bioinformatic algorithm that predict transmembrane regions in the primary amino acid sequences,  <dig> genes  of the m. tuberculosis h37rv genome were found to possess between  <dig> and  <dig> tmhs. each α-helix consists of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid residues which interact with the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. the proteins identified in this study were analysed by the tmhmm algorithm and  <dig> were predicted to have  <dig> or more tmh regions , among those,  <dig> represented novel identifications . proteins with one tmh were only considered as possible membrane proteins if the tmh region was positioned beyond the first  <dig> n-terminal amino acids. this was done to avoid confusion with potential secreted proteins.

lipoproteins
lipoproteins represent a subgroup of exported proteins characterized by the presence of a lipobox. the lipobox motif is located in the distal c-terminal part of the n-terminal signal peptide  <cit> . this motif is a recognition signal for lipid modification on the conserved and essential cysteine residue. precursor lipoproteins are mainly translocated in a sec-dependent manner across the plasma membrane and are subsequently modified  <cit> . the proteins identified in this study were analysed by the lipop algorithm http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/lipop/, and  <dig> were predicted as potential lipoproteins  based on the presence of a cleavable signal peptide and a lipobox motif. eight lipoproteins are described for the first time. in sum the findings comprises over 56% of all predicted lipoproteins in the genome.

outer membrane proteins
outer membrane proteins  are a class of proteins residing in the outer membrane of bacterial cells. identification of omps is important as they are exposed on the bacterial surface and so are accessible drug targets. recently, song and colleagues analysed the genome of m. tuberculosis and predicted  <dig> proteins as potential omps based on the amphilicity of the β-strand regions, absence of hydrophobic α-helices and the presence of a signal peptide  <cit> . in our study, we observed  <dig>  of these proteins, and  <dig> of them have not been described in previous proteomic works .

gravy
the 'grand mean of hydropathicity'  score is the average hydropathy score for a protein. according to kyte and doolittle, integral membrane proteins have a higher gravy score than soluble proteins. a positive score >- <dig>  suggests increased probability for membrane association; the higher the score, the greater the probability  <cit> . gravy scores were calculated for all the identified proteins using the protparam tool http://us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html. three-hundred and sixty nine proteins without a tmh region had positive gravy scores . a substantial proportion of the detected proteins lacked a predicted retention region and had a negative gravy score, suggesting that they were soluble proteins. however, it is possible that at least some of them might be functionally membrane-associated through formation of protein complexes with membrane-anchored proteins. in a previous study we showed that several hydrophilic proteins are retained in the lipophilic membrane fraction due to interaction with hydrophobic proteins  <cit> .

relative abundance index
to estimate the relative abundance of the observed proteins, we used the empai algorithm, which is based on the calculation of identified peptides per protein and normalized by the theoretical number of peptides for the same protein . the outcome of the empai analysis is given for a selection of membrane proteins and lipoproteins with the highest values in table  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. at the top of the membrane protein list is the possible proline rich antigen pra , with  <dig>  mol %. this is a small protein with  <dig> kda, and has  <dig> tmhs. when digested with trypsin, it constitutes  <dig> observable tryptic peptides, where  <dig> of them were identified. this protein has also been observed in m. bovis  <cit> . the membrane proteins rv <dig> and rv <dig> are the most abundant ones, but with no annotated biological functions. in the lipoprotein list only the first three proteins are assigned functions, while the  <dig> others have unknown biological functions.

gene sequence analysis
an in-depth analysis of our data indicated that  <dig> proteins were consistently identified in m. tuberculosis and not in m. bovis and these were: possible glutamine-transport transmembrane protein atp binding cassette  transporter  and possible conserved lipoprotein lpqg . the dna sequences encoding the two proteins including  <dig> base pairs  up-stream were obtained from tuberculist for m. tuberculosis and bovilist for m. bovis and the sequences were aligned using the blast  <dig> algorithm. no differences were found for rv <dig> which had 100% similarity between m. bovis and m. tuberculosis. however, the conserved lipoprotein lpqg  appeared to be  <dig> bp shorter in m. bovis compared to m. tuberculosis with a difference in the n-terminal end of the gene. consequently, the protein product was  <dig> amino acids shorter. when the primary sequence of the protein product was analysed by the lipop algorithm, it appeared that the lipobox was missing in m. bovis and the protein cannot be considered as a lipoprotein .

discussion
due to the anticipated role of membrane- and membrane-associated proteins of m. tuberculosis in virulence, it is important to characterize these proteins. therefore, the aim of the present study was to perform a proteomic analysis of these proteins from the virulent reference strain m. tuberculosis h37rv in extracts obtained with the non-ionic detergent triton x- <dig>  the proteins from the lipid phase of the detergent, which was enriched for membrane proteins as validated by immuno-blotting , were precipitated, separated, and identified by high accuracy mass spectrometry. in total,  <dig> proteins were identified and analysis of the primary amino acid sequences by bioinformatic tools revealed that 31% of the proteins were membrane- or membrane-associated. the list included more than 50% of all predicted integral membrane proteins in the genome.

these results show a significant improvement compared to the two studies of mycobacterial plasma membrane proteins by gu et. al.  <cit>  and xiong et al.,  <cit> . in these studies, membrane proteins were enriched by differential centrifugation and alkaline treatment of crude membranes with sodium carbonate and urea and separated by sds-page followed by protein identification with lc-ms/ms. the study by gu et al. revealed  <dig> m. tuberculosis h37rv proteins including  <dig> membrane proteins , while xiong et al. identified  <dig> proteins, of which  <dig> were predicted membrane proteins . the low percentage of integral plasma membrane proteins among the proteins identified in these studies was probably based in the membrane enrichment methods. we reduced the soluble protein contamination by phase separation of whole bacterial sonicates, and also applied state-of-the-art mass spectrometry analysis for identification of peptides.

more than 50% of all predicted lipoproteins in the genome were found. these are proteins translocated across the cell membrane and retained in the cell envelope by post-translational lipid modification. they are functionally diverse, and are suggested to be involved in host-pathogen interactions  <cit> . they are also of interest with respect to development of serodiagnostic tests for tuberculosis due to their strong immunogenicity  <cit> .

we also found 37% of all predicted omps  <cit> , which is an essential group of proteins involved in import of nutrients, secretion processes and host-pathogen interactions in gram-negative bacteria  <cit> , and this is also likely to be of great importance in mycobacteria because it is now firmly established that they have a true outer membrane  <cit> .

even though a considerable number of observed proteins were predicted as integral membrane- or membrane-associated proteins, a substantial proportion of the detected proteins lacked a predicted retention region. for those proteins we measured the gravy score which express the total hydrophobicity of a protein as an indicator for membrane association. however, this is just a measure of increased probability for membrane association based on the fact that most integral membrane proteins have a positive gravy value. if a protein has a positive value, even though it lacks a retention signal, it is probably associated with the membrane. on the other hand, some of the hydrophilic proteins with a negative gravy value might still be retained in the membrane through formation of protein complexes with membrane-anchored proteins  <cit> . several proteins in this group are encoded in operons of well known integral enzyme complexes  <cit> .

using state-of-the-art proteomic instrumentation and techniques, subtle details could be revealed at the individual protein level, such as experimental identification of signal peptide cleavage sites of predicted secreted proteins  <cit> , or confirmation of the start codon, or identification of peptides from regions predicted to be non-coding thus indicating a more up-stream start codon  <cit> , or even detection of novel genes  <cit> . therefore, the data obtained in this study was examined both in detail and in the context of what have been reported in the literature. to examine the amounts of individual proteins in the membrane fraction we applied the empai algorithm. the empai calculation gives an approximate estimate of the abundance of a certain protein, and it calculates the protein concentration   <cit> . an advantage of this method is that it gives a more realistic picture of the protein profile compared to the mrna levels, which could be difficult to relate to the actual protein amount. the membrane proteins  and the lipoproteins , with the highest relative abundance values are listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

interestingly, two of the proteins  among those with the highest relative abundance values were "possible glutamine-transport transmembrane abc transporter protein", with sequence motifs that belong to the abc transport system. glutamine is a major cell wall component of pathogenic mycobacteria only  <cit> . its production is mainly catalyzed extracellulary by glutamine synthetase glna <dig>   <cit> . tullius et. al.,  <dig> showed that a m. tuberculosis glna <dig> mutant requires a relatively high level of exogenous l-glutamine for growth in vitro, and the mutant was attenuated for intracellular growth in differentiated thp- <dig> cells, and it was also avirulent in infected guinea pigs  <cit> . identification of two related proteins among the most abundant membrane proteins in m. tuberculosis, underlines the importance of production and transport of glutamine for the pathogen and its virulence.

the rv <dig> protein is only reported in studies conducted on m. tuberculosis  <cit>  and not on m. bovis bcg . it was identified by  <dig> different peptides giving sequence coverage of 44%, and the high empai value observed for this membrane protein suggests that it is abundantly present in the membrane of the virulent m. tuberculosis h37rv strain. the open reading frames and sequences  <dig> bp up-stream to the start codon from m. tuberculosis h37rv and m. bovis bcg 1173p <dig> and af2122/ <dig> were aligned, but the dna sequences were identical and could not explain why rv <dig> has not been observed in m. bovis .

among the  <dig> most abundant lipoproteins  <dig> were not assigned any biological function, reflecting a fundamental lack of knowledge about these proteins. a careful examination revealed that the possible conserved lipoprotein lpqg  lies on the border of region of difference  <dig>   <cit> . rd <dig> is deleted from all m. bovis lineages and consequently this protein has only been identified in proteomic studies performed on m. tuberculosis h37rv  <cit> , but not been reported in previous proteomic works on m. bovis bcg  <cit> . this rd region is also missing in other mycobacterial strains such as mycobacterium microti or mycobacterium pinnipedii. this region was first described by gordon et. al.,  <dig>  <cit>  as rd <dig> and later put in an evolutionary context by brosch et. al.,  <dig>  <cit> , which now corresponds to the region rd <dig> described by behr et. al.,  <cit> . a close examination of the gene encoding rv <dig> revealed that it is  <dig> bp shorter with a deletion in the n-terminal region that includes the signal peptide and the predicted lipo-box in the genomic sequences of m. bovis af2122/ <dig> and m. bovis bcg pasteur 1173p <dig>  the gene is annotated to encode a lipoprotein in the m. bovis strains even though the lipo-box is missing and it is therefore questionable whether it should be considered as a lipoprotein in m. bovis. the identification of this protein with  <dig> peptides covering 34% of its sequence in m. tuberculosis h37rv suggests that it is a major lipoprotein.

the two lipoproteins listed in table  <dig>  annotated as "periplasmic phosphate-binding lipoprotein"  is a known antigen  <cit>  that also induces antibody responses in tuberculosis patients  <cit> . the  <dig> kda lipoprotein antigen precursor  have been extensively studied due to its immunogenic properties  <cit> . enrichment and analysis of lipoproteins with respect to humoral and cell-mediated immunity in infected individuals might ultimately lead to the identification of additional antigens that can serve as biomarkers for m. tuberculosis infection.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have enriched and extracted membrane- and membrane-associated proteins from m. tuberculosis h37rv using triton x- <dig>  and identified the largest number of this subset of proteins reported so far. further analysis of the data obtained in this study with bioinformatic tools suggests that several of these proteins are major membrane proteins. we have described one major lipoprotein of m. tuberculosis which has become a pseudogene by the rd <dig> deletion in m. bovis.
