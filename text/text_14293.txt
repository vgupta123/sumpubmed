BACKGROUND
the extraordinary virtuosity of streptomycetes as producers of secondary metabolites, including most of the antibiotics and anti-cancer agents in wide use, is associated with the developmental complexity of streptomyces colonies, which have a vegetative substrate mycelium and a spore-bearing aerial mycelium. among many mutants of the model species streptomyces coelicolor with pleiotropic defects in both aspects, this paper focuses on a mutant deleted for the blda locus, which specifies the only trna in the genome able to efficiently translate the rare leucine codon uua  <cit> . since the complex blda phenotype is likely to involve elements of both transcriptional and translational control, it is particularly suitable for an integrated functional genomics approach. with the aim of discovering consequences of blda mutation that are not obvious to the naked eye, we set out to analyse the rna and protein extracted from a series of liquid cultures of isogenic blda+ and blda deleted strains. this allowed us to focus on the effects of blda deletion on metabolism and overall cell physiology without the complication of the unsynchronised morphological differentiation observed with surface-grown s. coelicolor cultures. our results revealed unexpected effects of blda mutation on gene expression during growth and the transition phase that precedes entry into stationary phase, as well as more wide-ranging effects on secondary metabolism than previously suspected, and led to further exploration of some of the underpinning mechanisms. different, but complementary, results were obtained with the two "omic"approaches, and we conclude that there are significant benefits from their combined application.

RESULTS
general characterisation of changes in the transcriptome and proteome during liquid culture of strain m <dig>  and its blda deletion derivative
overall strategy
the genome sequence of s. coelicolor  <cit>  had been determined with dna from a widely-used plasmid-free derivative  of the wild-type strain a <dig>  we could not use m <dig> for the work described here, because of the unexpected finding that blda mutants cannot readily be constructed in m <dig> . instead, we used m <dig>  a plasmid-free prototrophic strain that was derived from the original wild-type strain a <dig> by a minimally mutated route, and has been used for physiological studies  <cit> . it proved straightforward to construct a blda deletion in m <dig> 

proteomic and transcriptomic analyses were done with cultures grown in casaminoacid-supplemented liquid minimal medium  to different stages . material from each culture was divided into two parts, which were processed separately for the extraction and characterisation of protein and rna. all transcriptome experiments were done using three independent time series for each strain , and two of these replicate sets of samples were used for the proteomic analysis. for transcriptome analysis, genomic dna labelled with cy- <dig> dctp was used as a common reference. this strategy allows the magnitude of expression to be estimated, rather than the relative expression level that is obtained from 'direct comparison' cdna vs cdna hybridisations. this enabled us to compare the level of transcript for each gene with the abundance of its corresponding protein product. the approach also allows transcriptome data to be compared directly with other microarray datasets that use genomic dna as the common reference. however, two important caveats emerged in the course of the work: first, for several technical reasons the microarray data can be relatively compressed compared with results from more gene-specific analytical procedures such as quantitative rt-pcr or s <dig> nuclease protection; and second, m <dig>  used as the "wild-type" strain here, turned out to have a duplication of the genes sco0021- <dig> compared with the m <dig> dna used as the microarray reference dna  <cit> . this duplication may have had some direct effects on levels of mrna and proteins corresponding to the duplicated genes, or indirect effects on genes elsewhere in the genome, but it did not affect the validity of the analysis of the effects of blda deletion described in this paper.

although protein samples were taken at all the time-points shown in fig  <dig>  the labour-intensiveness of 2-d gel analysis led us to confine the proteomic experiments to duplicate samples for each of five time-points , and to use high resolution 2-d gel separation only in the two pi ranges into which most proteins fall . among the proteins excluded by this approach were integral membrane proteins and extracellular proteins , proteins of less than ca. <dig> kda or more than ca. <dig> kda, and those with a basic pi .

detection of  <dig> differentially transcribed genes
for the transcriptome analysis,  <dig>  genes remained for comparison between the strains after filtering out genes deemed to be 'non-changing' because they had log <dig> expression levels between - <dig>  and  <dig>  in all  <dig> time points . applying different statistical approaches ,  <dig> genes – ~1% of all genes – were differentially transcribed between the wild-type and Δblda mutant at the specific thresholds applied . since previous work has focussed on genes whose expression is reduced in blda mutants, an interesting finding was that the expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> genes was significantly increased in the mutant strain  <  <dig>  for welch t-test and/or rank product analysis  respectively).

in order to validate the differentially expressed gene list independently,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes were also analysed by quantitative real time pcr , including sco <dig>  one of two tta-containing genes in the list of  <dig> genes . the expression profiles generated by the two techniques were broadly in agreement with each other, exhibiting spearman correlation coefficients ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .

unexpected effects of blda deletion at growth stages preceding stationary phase, leading to the discovery of abnormal ppgpp levels in the blda mutant
since blda mutants grow well, but differ from the wild-type most obviously in attributes expressed after the main growth period , we expected to find effects of blda deletion mainly on stationary phase gene expression. while one-third of the  <dig> differentially transcribed genes conformed to this expectation, the rest did not : two genes were most highly expressed during exponential growth in the mutant strain ,  <dig> were consistently more highly expressed during all phases of growth and a further  <dig>  encoding elements of the translational apparatus, showed a transient upshift at transition phase in the wild-type but not in the mutant . the tight transition phase-dependent expression change of the latter genes has also been seen in other wild-type strains . these observations suggest that, in addition to its important role in stationary phase biology, blda may also influence transcription of certain genes at earlier stages, either due to an involvement of blda in at least some exponential and transition phase processes, or because of some indirect effect of the loss of blda on cellular physiology. such indirect effects could include a 'shadow' cast by effects of blda on the formation of the spores used to inoculate the cultures , or some kind of stress response caused by the occupation of a proportion of ribosomes by untranslatable uua codon-containing rna . for example, two of these genes  contain tta codons, and translation of the transcripts detected is therefore dependent on blda. the identification of these genes as being significantly differently expressed suggests that their transcript abundance, in addition to their translation, is in some way blda-dependent. the  <dig> differentially expressed ribosomal protein genes listed in table  <dig> mostly fall within one cluster . further members of this and other ribosomal protein gene clusters appeared in the top rankings of genes down-regulated in blda compared to m <dig> but did not meet the statistical threshold criteria applied here. similar extensive alterations in patterns of protein abundance were not observed in the proteome study, primarily because most of the ribosomal proteins have isoelectric points that lie outside those used in the analysis ; but in any event the observed modulations in transcription may not have resulted in detectable changes in abundance of stable proteins such as those making up ribosomes. however, comparable changes have been documented at the proteome level in pulse-chase experiments, using a different medium, by vohradsky and thompson  <cit> .

the effects on transition-phase expression of ribosomal protein-encoding genes raised the possibility that the changes might be mediated via ppgpp, the stringent factor that controls transcription of rrna and certain ribosomal protein operons in e. coli and many other bacteria, including streptomycetes  <cit> . previous studies had shown that ppgpp concentrations increase transiently during transition phase growth of s. coelicolor in smm medium  <cit> . since ppgpp is synthesised when an insufficient supply of aminoacyl-charged trnas causes translation to stall, it was possible that stalling of ribosomes encountering a uua codon during translation in a blda mutant could similarly stimulate ppgpp synthesis. intracellular ppgpp concentrations were therefore analysed by hplc at four comparable timepoints leading up to transition phase in cultures of m <dig> and m <dig> Δblda similar to those used for the rna and protein analysis. the levels in the blda mutant were consistently two- to six-fold higher at each timepoint in the mutant than in the parent strain , supporting the idea that the observed large-scale changes in transition-phase transcription patterns are related to altered patterns of ppgpp synthesis. gtp levels were comparable between the two strains.

these results raise the strong possibility that some of the changes in the mrna and protein profiles resulting from the deletion of blda may be indirect effects of changes in the level of ppgpp. however, such effects are unlikely to be the principal reason for the most obvious features of the mutant phenotype, since the deficiencies in morphological development and actinorhodin synthesis can be suppressed by specifically replacing tta codons in appropriate regulatory genes by alternative leucine codons  <cit> .

among  <dig> differentially represented protein spots , the majority are maximally abundant in stationary phase in the wild-type
in the global proteomic analysis, about  <dig> spots were subjected to fluorescence quantification in each pi range, i.e. about  <dig>  in all. of these,  <dig> were identified by mass spectrometry of tryptic digests . the selection of spots for characterisation was to some extent guided by obvious temporal regulation, or changes in abundance between the two strains.  <dig> of the  <dig> spots were differentially represented between the two strains according to the mann-whitney u-test, and  <dig> of these were also among the  <dig> found to be differentially represented by a different procedure, employed to compensate for a limitation of the statistical approach . this second procedure searched for spots whose normalized volumes were changed two-fold or more between strains in both biological duplicate growth curves and in at least two  corresponding timepoints . the two groups of proteins gave a combined total of  <dig> differentially represented spots . as in the transcriptome analysis, some blda-influenced protein spots  were more abundant in Δblda than the parent strain, one of these  being detected in both analyses.

to assess the impact of blda mutation on proteins expressed at different growth phases in the parent strain, the  <dig> proteins were grouped into one of six temporal expression pattern classes by applying a set of simple mathematical rules . a summary is shown in fig. 3a . we emphasise that the bias in spot selection means that some of these classes are over-represented  or under-represented . as indicated in fig.  <dig>  the great majority of the spots influenced by blda showed strong up-regulation in stationary phase in the wild-type , though four examples were found of a blda-influenced spot that was more or less constitutive, echoing the evidence from microarray analysis that blda has some effects during exponential phase . the strong growth-stage-specificity of most proteins influenced by blda was consistent with the observation that the blda-specified trna is unusual in being most abundant in stationary phase, in contrast to most trnas, which are most abundant at high growth rates  <cit> . most of the differences between protein spot lists from the two mathematical approaches can be accounted for by the blindness of the mann-whitney u-test to the expression pattern most common among blda-influenced spots. figure 3c shows that when a protein spot is completely absent at all timepoints in both growth curves of one strain, it needs to be present in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> timepoints in both curves of the second strain in order to be called significantly different by that procedure. thus, the largest discrepancies between the two procedures are in expression group b, where protein spots may be detected only in the last two timepoints, and in the group of  <dig> proteins not detected at all in m <dig> . in total these groups account for  <dig> of the  <dig> differences between the two protein lists, and indicate why it was important to use both differential representation assessment procedures. the reasons for the unexpectedly small overlap between the differential expression lists obtained by proteome and transcriptome analyses are discussed below.

blda mutation affects some proteins post-translationally
an unexpected new aspect of the blda phenotype was the changes observed in post-translational modification/processing of  <dig> proteins . nine of these were detected as pairs of spots with similar apparent molecular weights but differing isoelectric points, and in three of the nine cases one of the two forms of the protein was completely absent in the blda mutant . the other two of the  <dig> proteins were detected as pairs of spots differing in both molecular weight and isoelectric point . one of the sco <dig> spots in m <dig>  with an apparent molecular weight of about  <dig> kda, was absent from the blda mutant, while the other, corresponding to the  <dig> kda predicted from its amino acid sequence, and presumably unmodified, was more abundant in the mutant. neither of the two sco <dig> spots coincided with the 2d gel location predicted for a  <dig> kda protein of pk  <dig> . however, sco <dig> is expected to be processed and exported from the cell, and the observed position of the higher molecular weight spot coincides with that predicted for the secreted protein . this form of the protein, possibly anchored in the cell membrane by a predicted transmembrane helix at its c-terminus, was more abundant in the parent strain in the stationary phase samples while the smaller of the two protein spots was approximately equally abundant in both strains.

summary of global effects of blda mutation
in summary,  <dig> genes were identified as being affected by blda deletion,  <dig> and  <dig> uniquely from transcriptomics or proteomics respectively . eleven genes were found in both analyses . all  <dig> genes are considered together in subsequent sections dealing with the effects of blda deletion on secondary metabolism and with the genetic routes by which some genes are affected by the deletion. we also consider some evidently meaningful effects of the blda deletion that were not found by the statistical analysis.

mutation of blda has little effect on primary metabolic genes associated with growth, but does affect some genes associated with nutritional stress, as well as more secondary metabolic genes than previously recognised.
primary metabolism
the growth rate of the blda mutant in minimal media is as rapid as that of the wild-type . the mutant was therefore not expected to show significant changes in the abundance of mrnas or proteins involved in primary metabolism. in general confirmation of this, the major biosynthetic pathways for amino acids, nucleotides and vitamins were apparently unaffected, with the exceptions of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis  and biotin biosynthesis ; and among the central pathways of primary carbon metabolism , the only major changes seen involved increased abundance in the blda mutant of protein and mrna from one of three genes annotated as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  . sco <dig> is orthologous with a gap gene of streptomyces aureofaciens that was reported to be induced at the time of aerial growth on glucose-free medium  <cit> . in addition, a spot comprising a fragment of citrate synthase  was enhanced in the proteome of the mutant, though the major citrate synthase spot was unaffected.

however, some effects were seen on more peripheral aspects of primary and salvage metabolism, such as might be expected to be active after the main growth phase. the more basic of two sco <dig>  spots was absent from the mutant; the product of a conserved hypothetical gene apparently translationally coupled to the downstream rocd -like gene was less abundant in the mutant; and a putative uracil phosphoribosyltransferase  was likewise less abundant in the mutant. changes in the abundance of both a basic and an acidic form of sco <dig>  a homologue of thiosulphate sulphurtransferase , were seen in the mutant.

interestingly, multiple protein forms were associated with ten of the  <dig> blda-influenced protein spots potentially associated with primary/intermediary metabolic processes , suggesting that the majority of these effects may be indirect subtle changes in post-translational modifications .

secondary metabolism
streptomycetes are very important producers of antibiotics and other valuable secondary metabolites. bentley et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> genes or gene clusters in the genome sequence of s. coelicolor that are likely to determine secondary metabolite production. in our proteomic analysis, the abundance of gene products from seven of these was found to be affected by blda, one of them, a type iii polyketide synthase , being more abundant in the mutant . previously, only two of these gene sets  had been found to be influenced by blda. in general, proteomic analysis here and in previous work  <cit>  failed to detect some of the proteins specified by each cluster. in most cases this reflected the properties of the proteins themselves . for reasons discussed below, only two of the secondary metabolism gene sets  were among those identified as being affected by blda in the transcriptome analysis .

act gene cluster 
the acetate-derived blue aromatic polyketide, actinorhodin, whose production is encoded by the extensively studied act genes, is absent from blda mutants. each of the  <dig> act biosynthetic transcription units was represented by at least one spot in the proteomic analysis, and each showed strong dependence on growth phase and on blda . three act genes, sco <dig>  sco <dig> and sco <dig>  were also identified from the transcriptome analysis. putting these data together with previous less extensive results, it appears that every act biosynthetic operon is likely to be regulated by actii-orf <dig>  the pathway-specific regulatory gene containing the tta codon previously shown to mediate blda-dependence of actinorhodin production  <cit> . most act genes were not identified as significantly differentially expressed by transcriptome analysis, although there is compelling evidence from previous studies that they are very markedly blda-dependent  <cit> . examination of the microarray data revealed excessive variance within the data for these genes . this may be why they failed to meet the stringent statistical criteria employed: relaxing the criteria yielded more act genes .

red gene cluster 
the red prodiginine pigments determined by the red gene cluster are absent from blda mutants except under certain conditions . only one red biosynthetic protein, the methyl transferase redi, was detected in this study. it appeared in the later time points, when redi transcripts also became more abundant. redi abundance was strongly dependent on blda, probably because of a tta codon in redz  <cit> , which encodes an atypical response regulator believed to activate a second regulatory gene, redd, that in turn activates at least some of the red biosynthetic genes  <cit> . thus, the blda-dependence of redi may reflect either a direct dependence of redi on redz, or an indirect effect via redd. as with the act genes , further red genes were detected as differentially transcribed only when the statistical criteria were relaxed.

cda gene cluster 
s. coelicolor produces a lipopeptide antibiotic cda which is chemically similar to daptomycin, a drug recently approved for the treatment of certain mrsa infections  <cit> . the oxygenase encoded by sco <dig>  the only protein detected from the cda cluster, dramatically increased in abundance in the parental strain during transition phase before falling back during late stationary phase. levels of this protein were reduced in the blda mutant.

deoxysugar/glycosyltransferase cluster 
these  <dig> genes are arranged in what could be a single operon, with the largest intergenic region being  <dig> bp between sco0386- <dig>  they include two tta-containing genes , neither of regulatory character, and neither being represented in the proteome. proteomics data were collected for five proteins from this cluster, and four were found to be reduced in abundance by two-fold or more in the blda mutant. the complete absence from the blda mutant of gene products from the last two genes in the cluster, sco <dig> and  <dig>  suggests that the tta codons in upstream genes could exert polarity effects. the reduced abundance of mrna for the first two genes in the cluster, which are upstream of the tta codons, although not statistically significant, perhaps suggests that polarity effects on protein synthesis may result in destabilisation of the whole message .

type iii pks 
the type iii polyketide synthase specified by sco <dig>  which has very recently been shown to be responsible for the production of a germination inhibitor, germicidin  <cit> , increased slightly in abundance during growth of the parent strain m <dig>  peaking in the last stationary phase sample, but was 5- to 10-fold overproduced in the blda mutant at all time-points . qrt-pcr confirmed that the transcript was also more abundant in the mutant strain, especially in the later timepoints .

coelichelin biosynthetic cluster 
the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase encoded by this cluster produces an iron-chelating metabolite, coelichelin  <cit> . although there are no tta-containing genes in or near the cluster, the products of sco <dig> and  <dig> were less abundant in the blda mutant, while the products of sco <dig> and  <dig> were unaffected. the sco <dig> gene was also identified as being significantly differentially expressed from the transcriptome data. unusually among the secondary metabolism-related proteins detected in this work, these gene products were readily detected before the onset of stationary phase . the presence of regulatory dna sequence motifs similar to iron-dependent repressor binding sites upstream of several genes in this cluster suggests responsiveness to the intracellular iron concentration  <cit> . it is not known whether the effects of blda are independent of iron-responsiveness.

desferrioxamines biosynthetic cluster 
like the coelichelin biosynthetic cluster above, the desferrioxamines cluster encodes production of an iron siderophore  <cit> , and possesses an iron-dependent repressor motif upstream of the first gene in the cluster . two proteins from this cluster were detected in the proteomics data from this experiment: sco <dig> protein was more abundant in the blda mutant during some of the early timepoints when compared to the parental strain, and sco <dig> shows a slightly altered pattern of expression in the mutant strain.

roles of regulatory and tta-containing genes in the changed patterns of gene expression in the blda mutant.
of the  <dig> tta-containing genes in the annotated genome of s. coelicolor,  <dig> are predicted to encode regulatory proteins  <cit> . none of these  <dig> proteins was detected by proteomics, presumably because of low abundance in the growth conditions studied. however, reduced expression of genes known to be activated by tta-containing regulatory genes provided indirect evidence for the absence from the blda mutant of the regulatory proteins encoded by adpa , actii-orf <dig> , redz  and sco <dig> . in addition, regulatory proteins encoded by three tta-free genes were reduced in abundance in the blda mutant, perhaps accounting for at least some of the changes in gene expression in the mutant. one of the three is an arsr-family transcriptional regulator , so it was interesting that a motif reminiscent of the arsr-binding site determined in e. coli  <cit>   precedes a group of six differentially expressed genes. another of the three is a nickel-responsive fur-like repressor of a putative nickel transport operon . a sco <dig> deletion mutant exhibited a higher intracellular nickel concentration than the parent  <cit> , so blda may be similarly affected. the third  showed homology to sensory histidine protein kinases. sco <dig>  encoding another such kinase, was also significantly altered in its pattern of transcription.

one of many likely operons affected by blda is the target of a regulator encoded by a nearby tta-containing gene
of the  <dig> genes identified as being blda-influenced in table  <dig> or additional file  <dig>   <dig> are probably co-transcribed with other genes  <cit>  in a total of  <dig> putative operons. sixteen of these operons have more than one member listed in table  <dig> or additional file  <dig> , reinforcing their classification as blda-dependent. apart from those involved in secondary metabolism , the others include a cluster of function-unknown genes whose expression was particularly strongly dependent on blda at the mrna  and protein levels   <cit> . a search of the genome revealed a nearby tta-containing gene, sco <dig>  encoding a luxr-family regulator. the effect of deleting sco <dig> on expression of the sco4251- <dig> operon was therefore analysed. s <dig> nuclease protection experiments indicated that transcription of sco <dig>  the first gene in the putative sco4251- <dig> operon , starts  <dig> bp upstream of the translational start site, and is completely dependent on sco <dig> . as a control, transcription of another strongly blda-dependent gene, sco <dig>  <cit> , was unaffected in the sco <dig> mutant. proteomic analysis also demonstrated that the sco4251- <dig> proteins, readily detected in the parent strain, were absent from the sco <dig> mutant , confirming the blda-dependence of these three genes via the tta-containing regulator. there was no obvious phenotypic change associated with the deletion of sco <dig> 

apparent destabilisation of uua-containing polycistronic mrna by blda deletion
the transcript of sco <dig>  a tta-containing gene of unknown function, was less abundant, and its gene product – the only one from a tta-containing gene to be detected in the proteome analysis – completely absent, in the blda mutant. the stop codon of sco <dig> overlaps the start site for the downstream sco <dig> gene, whose rna and protein products were also less abundant in the blda mutant, indicating that the two genes are cotranscribed and possibly translationally coupled. possibly, a polarity effect on protein synthesis resulting from stalling of translation at the sco <dig> uua codon upstream accounts for reduced sco <dig> expression, and the consequent uncoupling of transcription and translation may further result in exposure of the mrna to rnase action, in turn reducing the half-life and overall abundance of mrna corresponding to both genes. such an explanation may also account for the similar situation described above for the deoxysugar cluster .

another group of linked genes, sco0991- <dig>  most of which encode integral membrane proteins, was preferentially transcribed late in the wild-type, and transcription of sco <dig> , sco <dig>  and sco <dig>  was reduced in the blda mutant. sco <dig>  the tta-containing gene encoding a putative cysteine synthase, and sco <dig> were not identified as being significantly affected by blda mutation, presumably failing to meet the statistical criteria . the half-life of the uua-containing putative polycistronic sco0991- <dig> mrna may therefore also be affected by blda-dependent uncoupling of transcription and translation. we note that the gene next to, and diverging from, the sco0991- <dig> cluster, sco <dig>  and also encoding a membrane protein, was also blda-dependent.

discussion
few of the genes found to be affected by blda contain tta codons
some  <dig> genes were found by rna and/or proteome analysis to be affected by blda. further differences are likely to be found when the strains are growing on the surface of agar, conditions in which the mutant forms no obvious aerial mycelium or spores. some genes  showed increased expression in the blda mutant. of the  <dig> whose protein products were found to be less abundant in the mutant, only one  has a tta codon.  the gels examined contained about  <dig> different protein spots. based on a reported average of  <dig>  spots per gene  <cit> , these correspond to about  <dig> genes, i.e. about 16% of the genome. the products of the tta-containing genes in the s. coelicolor genome  are therefore strikingly under-represented in our analysis. thus, the growth conditions used here  did not favour the expression of most of these genes. this would be consistent with the idea that many tta-containing genes are adapted for expression either during surface growth and differentiation, or in specialised ecological niches or physiological responses. a similar conclusion was reached by li et al.  <cit> , in a study in which mutations in  <dig> tta-containing genes of s. coelicolor were found to cause no obvious phenotypic changes. since nearly all of the genes that seemed to be influenced by blda in our analysis lack a tta, these effects must have been indirect. three indirect routes probably account for most of the effects . first, some of the blda-influenced genes are regulated by tta-containing genes, most of which are expressed at levels too low to make them amenable to the analytical procedures employed. we estimate that dependence on such weakly-expressed tta-containing genes accounts for the blda-dependence of at least  <dig> genes found in the transcriptome and proteome analyses. the upstream sequences of the genes with differentially expressed transcripts were analysed to identify over-represented dna motifs that may be indicative of co-regulation of genes by the same regulatory protein, and the ten statistically most significant motifs are shown in additional file  <dig>  none resemble binding motifs reported or proposed for the s. coelicolor regulators encoded by tta-containing genes i.e. adpa  <cit> , actii-orf <dig>  <cit> , redz , or previously reported consensus promoter sequences in s. coelicolor. secondly, eight of the genes affected are probably co-transcribed with tta-containing genes, and the resulting uua-containing mrnas may have a reduced half-life under conditions in which the uua codon is not readily translated. thirdly, blda deletion changes the profile of ppgpp abundance and eliminates a transient upshift in transcription of ribosomal protein genes at the transition phase that precedes entry into stationary phase . this extraordinary effect may arise through a triggering of the stringent response, because of ribosomes encountering untranslatable uua codons in a small proportion of mrnas. it is likely that the changed ppgpp levels will affect the expression of some genes even before transition phase, and that the disturbance of transition phase gene expression will have knock-on effects on gene expression during stationary phase, the stage at which most of the known phenotypic consequences of blda mutation are manifested.

comparison of the results from proteomic and transcriptomic analysis 
for a number of reasons, discussed at various points in the preceding text, we did not expect to find simple global correlations between transcript and protein levels, particularly in view of the fact that no system of statistical analysis is well-suited to integration of the kinds of data given here. nevertheless, using the spearman rank correlation as detailed in the methods, there was a weak but significant global correlation at the 5% level between the proteome and transcriptome values at each time-point, with correlation coefficients ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for wild-type timepoints  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the corresponding times in Δblda . only  <dig> genes were positively correlated across both strains at the  <dig>  probability level, while five genes notably even showed significant negative correlations between transcript and protein abundance . three of the latter genes encode highly important enzymes of primary metabolism , and in each case the anomaly could be ascribed to changes in the modification/processing state of the protein. a similar explanation has not been eliminated for the remaining two cases .

congruence across time was calculated by spearman rank correlation given different data sets where set a represents  <dig> time points in m <dig>  b represents  <dig> time points in Δblda and c represents  <dig> time points spanning both m <dig> and Δblda .

comparing table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  only eleven blda-influenced genes were found by both approaches . however, at least  <dig> of the  <dig> significantly differentially transcribed genes encode proteins that are predicted to be undetected in the 2d gel proteomics approach employed, because of their physical properties , multiple transmembrane domains or putative secretion: ). indeed, four of the genes in table  <dig> that encode putatively secreted protein products  and are down-regulated in blda, were reported to be less abundant in the mutant extracellular proteome  <cit> . taking this into account, there were ten discrepancies involving failure of the proteome analysis to find genes picked out in the transcriptome study, and this may be associated with limitations of the proteomics approach for detecting proteins of low abundance. in addition, the higher number of replicates and sampling points in the transcriptomics study will have increased the power of this analysis for determining statistically significant changes. some changes in the proteome were not picked up by transcriptome analysis. many of these may reflect either post-translational processes of potential physiological significance , or differing stabilities of the mrna and corresponding protein products of gene expression. thus, there are real benefits in using a combination of proteome and transcriptome analyses to assess global gene expression, where limitations in one technique tend to be compensated by strengths of the other. because of its sensitivity and genuinely global nature, the transcriptome approach captures data on lowly expressed genes, and on secreted, membrane or high molecular weight gene products, which are all poorly represented in whole-cell proteomics data. proteomics on the other hand informs on the abundance of the end-product of gene expression, encompassing the effects of both post-transcriptional and post-translational regulatory mechanisms that cannot be glimpsed through transcriptomics.

CONCLUSIONS
the role and evolution of a blda-based checkpoint for streptomyces differentiation
taking into account the sum total of information now available about the effects of blda mutations, and the occurrence and nature of tta-containing genes in streptomycetes, we suggest the following blda-centred model of streptomyces physiology.

nutrient-limited conditions in most bacteria, including streptomycetes, are signalled through a mechanism involving ppgpp that generally results in decreased production of the machinery for macromolecular synthesis, including trnas. in the case of streptomycetes, such conditions may apply either when the environment changes, or in centrally located parts of the colony in which nutrient demands have come to outstrip the rate at which external supplies can diffuse in. it is in the latter parts of the colony that morphological and physiological differentiation take place. the transcription of the blda-specified pro-trna and its processing to a mature form are increased in these conditions, as if blda responds to nutrient limitation in the opposite way from other translational components. indeed, nutritional shiftdown-induced increases in ppgpp concentration that strongly inhibited transcription of the rrnd geneset for 16s rrna did not inhibit blda transcription and processing  <cit> .

a relative increase in the level of blda trna provides an intracellular environment suitable for the translation of uua-containing mrna. in view of our evidence suggesting that such mrnas have reduced abundance when the translation of their uua codons is restricted, their free translation would increase the abundance of the messages, potentially further increasing the levels of the protein products. this enhancement may apply to individual structural genes or whole operons , causing rapid changes in the activity of the corresponding biochemical activities and pathways. such pathways nearly all show some degree of species-specificity, and many of them probably confer adaptive benefits in very particular environmental circumstances  <cit> . the enhancement should also apply to the expression of tta-containing regulatory genes. some of these activate pathway gene sets for antibiotic biosynthesis, and one, adpa, activates some critical aspects of morphological differentiation, at least partially by influencing an extracellular protease cascade  <cit> . others activate other, often still uncharacterised, gene sets . we presume that many of the processes showing some dependence on blda are also subject to other regulatory influences, and that the role of blda is to provide one of possibly several checkpoints that must be achieved before commitment to particular physiological activities, such as the onset of secondary metabolism or the activation of substrate mycelium autolysis that is associated with reproductive aerial growth.

if exposure of uua-containing mrna to ribosomes limited for blda trna elicits ppgpp synthesis as our results suggest, this could reduce the efficiency of transcription of any genes adapted for expression in conditions favouring very rapid growth. many bacteriophage genes have such adaptations. it could be imagined that the presence of uua codons in highly expressed genes of streptomyces phages would reduce the effective expression levels of such genes, providing a possible selective route for the evolution of the blda checkpoint.
