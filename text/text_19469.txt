BACKGROUND
oomycetes are a group of eukaryotic micro-organisms of the kingdom stramenopila that exhibit a wide breadth of life styles from free-living saprophytes in aquatic and soil environments, to above ground endophytes and obligately biotrophic parasites of plants and animals  <cit> . despite having filamentous, fungal-like morphology during most of their life cycle, oomycetes are most closely related to brown algae and unicellular diatoms  <cit> .

terrestrial oomycetes cause some of the most economically destructive plant diseases worldwide such as late blight of potato , downy mildews and root rots in a wide range of seed and forage crops, fruits, vegetables and ornamentals. albugo candida  roussel is a key species for comparative genomics in the oomycetes as the archetypal crop pathogen in the albuginales, which is an order that consists exclusively of obligate biotrophs. the albuginales diverged early from the peronosporales, which includes a wider spectrum of necrotrophs , hemibiotrophs  and obligate biotrophic downy mildews   <cit> .

disease resistance to oomycete pathogens has been a major target of plant breeding programs, and also a focus of genetics research to reveal the molecular basis of major resistance genes for use in crops  <cit> . parallel progress in oomycete genetics has been much slower. however, recent advances from map-based strategies have identified several avirulence  proteins in downy mildew and phytophthora pathogens which match major disease resistance genes in their natural hosts  <cit> . advances have also been made in comparative oomycete genomics with public release of reference genomes for three phytophthora species , pythium ultimum and h. arabidopsidis from large sequencing consortia  <cit> , and production of expressed sequence tags  for these species  <cit> .

most oomycete avr proteins share a conserved amino-terminal signal peptide and a specific 'rxlr' motif, which is generally thought to be required for delivery of proteins with inherent virulence functions into the host cell  <cit> . the rxlr motif and flanking amino acids were used to develop algorithms that have enabled identification of more than  <dig> candidate effector proteins encoded by the genomes of different phytophthora species  <cit>  and  <dig> in h. arabidopsidis, the downy mildew pathogen of arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . mutational and transient expression analyses have confirmed that several phytophthora proteins have a virulence effector function in plants  <cit> .

albugo species cause a destructive disease called white blister rust  <cit> . the disease derives its name from the appearance of white pustules, due to enzymatic digestion of epidermal cell wall, on the surface of leaves and other aerial parts of the host  <cit> . the pustules contain masses of dehydrated sporangiospores that upon re-hydration in water droplets release 4- <dig> zoospores that can swim to stomatal openings, encyst and produce a germ tube which will extend into the sub-stomatal chamber and penetrate the host cell. a primary vesicle forms in the host cell, which enables further development of intercellular hyphae in a susceptible interaction  <cit> . stomatal infection and spore dispersal via epidermal emergence indicate convergence in life cycle adaptation to unrelated basidiomycete rust fungi.

white blister rust has been an important experimental model for investigating the molecular basis of disease resistance, pathogen virulence, host-parasite speciation, and the phenomenon of sustained defence suppression that is typically associated with 'green islands' of compatible host tissue  <cit> . for instance, the type species, albugo candida  roussel was originally collected from a wild species capsella bursa-pastoris  <cit>  but represents a highly variable complex of physiological races, each of which are pathogens in different oilseed, vegetable brassicas or other wild crop relatives  <cit> . more narrowly specialized species occur on other wild members of the brassicaceae such as a common pathogen of a. thaliana that was recently named as albugo laibachii  <cit> . rare accessions of a. thaliana are susceptible under laboratory conditions to a. candida races  <dig> and  <dig>  derived from brassica juncea and brassica rapa, respectively, and have thus enabled genetic characterisation of white rust resistance  genes in a non-host crop relative  <cit> . the first example, wrr <dig>  encodes a tir-nbs-lrr protein which confers broad spectrum resistance to at least four a. candida races in a. thaliana  <cit> , and also confers resistance in transgenic oilseed crops of b. juncea and b. napus  <cit> . the broad spectrum  nature of wrr <dig> suggests that the multiple physiological races of a. candida from domestic and wild host species express a highly conserved avirulence protein.

to support efforts for the genetic improvement of white rust control in brassica crops, we have developed genomic resources for a. candida to enable identification of candidate effector proteins expressed by the pathogen, including the predicted avirulence protein recognised by wrr <dig> in a. thaliana. here we report analyses of ests from two cdna libraries and a draft genome sequence generated from the a. candida race  <dig> isolate  <cit>  re-designated ac2vrr . the first cdna library was constructed from susceptible b. juncea tissue infected with ac2vrr, and a second library was made from ac2vrr sporangiospores collected from susceptible seedlings.

RESULTS
est production and assembly
a cdna library was constructed from the susceptible b. juncea cultivar 'cutlass' infected with the a. candida race  <dig> isolate ac2vrr. approximately  <dig>  cdna clones  were sequenced from both directions and after sequence quality assessment a total of  <dig>  ests were collected. a computational pipeline was developed to distinguish plant-derived versus pathogen-derived ests. ests with significant sequence similarity to any plant gene were predicted as being transcripts derived from b. juncea during infection, whereas the remaining ests were putatively ascribed as originating from the pathogen. this in silico separation was intentionally designed to be conservative in assigning a "plant" designation to ests, as we sought to be highly confident about identifying sequences that were expressed by the pathogen. as a result, 28% of the assembled cdnas  were predicted as being derived from ac2vrr.

to provide a companion dataset of ac2vrr transcripts, we also sequenced a full length normalized cdna library generated from ac2vrr sporangiospores. these ests provide a rich sample of transcripts expressed in the pathogen inoculum, and include genes encoding proteins important for initiating the infection process. a total of  <dig>  high quality ests were obtained. we compared ests from the two complementary libraries to derive a combined data set of  <dig>  pathogen transcripts from ac2vrr, consisting of  <dig>  that were present in both libraries,  <dig>  that were only found in the library from infected host tissue, and  <dig>  from the second 'pre-infection' library generated from sporangiospores .

genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation
to validate the predicted a. candida cdnas and to map the physical arrangement of genes within the genome, we generated a draft reference genome by sequencing genomic dna from sporangiospores of ac2vrr. using pyrosequencing we completed a  <dig> × shotgun coverage of the ac2vrr genome which included a  <dig> kb paired-end library . assembly of the shotgun data yielded  <dig>  mbps in  <dig>  contigs of at least  <dig> bps with an n <dig> of  <dig> kb. after scaffolding the assembly was resolved to  <dig> scaffolds covering  <dig>  mbps with an n <dig> of  <dig> kb. average coverage of the assembled data was identified by performing a reference assembly of the sequencing data against the assembled sequence using newbler . an average coverage depth of  <dig> × was observed in the reference assembly and the estimated genome size was calculated by taking the total number of base pairs input to the assembly  and dividing that by the average coverage  to yield an estimated genome size of  <dig>  mb which is very close to the previously published estimate of  <dig>  mb  <cit> . therefore the scaffolded  <dig>  mb assembly represents 76% of the estimated genome size which compares favourably to the 82-84% of the h. arabidopsidis genome recently reported  <cit> . this disparity between the assembled and estimated genome size could be due to un-resolved repetitive elements or arise from telomeric, centromeric and peri-centromeric regions of the genome which would be inaccessible to these sequencing methods.

additional validation of the assembly was carried out by alignment of  <dig> bacs from ac2vrr which were sequenced as a  <dig> kb paired-end library using titanium chemistry. each of the  <dig> bacs was individually assembled using newbler and in all  <dig> cases the data assembled into a single scaffold . the assembled bac sequences were then aligned to the genomic scaffolds using mummer  <cit>  and visually inspected . the regions of the shotgun genome assembly which correspond to these bacs show a very high level of sequence similarity with the genomic assembly.

the assembled genome had a gc content of approximately 43% with a very minor increase in the coding regions of 1-2%. repeat structure analysis using repeatmodeler  <cit>  and repeatmasker  <cit>  revealed that 17% of the assembled genome was repetitive . analysis of the single copy core eukaryotic genes  via cegma  <cit>  revealed that the a. candida genome assembly harbours  cegs as complete  or partial models . by contrast to the cegma analysis, mapping assembled cdnas using blat  <cit>  onto the assembled genome revealed that 98% of the expressed genes were identified within the assembled genome. therefore while the cegma results might imply less than complete genome our assessment of the assembly using the cdna data demonstrate that this assembly is a high-quality draft assembly of the a. candida gene-space as defined by chain et al  <cit> . de novo gene prediction was accomplished using software, glimmerhmm  <cit>  and geneid  <cit> , trained specifically for a. candida using our cdna data. combining multiple types of evidence through the use of evidence modeler  <cit>  we identified a total of  <dig>  gene models, implying an average inter-genic distance of  <dig>  bp. from the alignments of our assembled cdnas to the genome sequence, it was apparent that the majority  of predicted genes in ac2vrr do not contain an intron. validation of the predicted genes in the ac2vrr genome was achieved using rna-seq data from sporangiospores. rna-seq data was aligned to the genome using bowtie  <cit> , tophat  <cit> , and cufflinks  <cit> . the results of the cufflinks report on the specificity and sensitivity of the gene predictions  indicate a very high accuracy in the prediction of genes within the albugo candida genome with minor discrepancies at intron/exon junctions.

using the ac2vrr draft genome, we screened ests from the pathogen infected plant material and calculated the number of false positives, true positives, false negatives and true negatives for our in silico separation of host and pathogen ests . as expected, this method provided a very high specificity  with low sensitivity . the low sensitivity arises from the fact that many housekeeping genes from ac2vrr share some level of sequence similarity with orthologous genes in the host plant. further validation of a. candida transcripts was achieved by pcr amplification from genomic dna  of a set of  <dig> cdnas assigned computationally as being derived from ac2vrr . the high specificity indicates that ests being predicted as originating from the pathogen were confirmed within the genome sequence for ac2vrr. taken together, these measures of specificity and sensitivity indicate that this computational approach is useful for identifying expressed genes that are highly specific to the pathogen in the absence of a genome sequence for the pathogen.

these genomic data provide an initial opportunity to assess the genome organisation of a. candida and the degree to which orthologous genes appear to have been retained relative to other oomycetes. using blast we identified  <dig>  putative orthologs in p. ultimum,  <dig>  to p. infestans,  <dig>  to p. sojae,  <dig>  to p. ramorum, and  <dig>  to h. arabidopsidis. we investigated whether a. candida was deficient in the same metabolic pathways as those reported for h. arabidopsidis  <cit> . albugo candida is deficient in the same nitrate, nitrite, and sulphite reductases as h. arabidopsidis .

the albugo candida secretome
we identified a secretome comprised of  <dig> proteins from the annotated set of albugo candida proteins, using previously established criteria  <cit>  such as the presence of amino-terminal signal peptide, a motif indicating that the encoded protein is likely to be secreted by the pathogen, and lack of additional trans-membrane domains. the ac2vrr secretome appears to be of about 2/ <dig> the size of the p. infestans secretome  <cit> . in contrast to the extensive family expansions observed in phytophthora genomes, the gene families of the a. candida secretome have relatively few members . for example, the largest a. candida secreted protein family consists of  <dig> members, whereas the largest family in phytophthora has hundreds of members. even in the pathogen h. arabidopsidis with a reduced genome, the largest effector family is more than a hundred members  <cit> . interestingly the largest secreted gene family in a. candida is comprised of six crinkler-like  proteins. many of the gene families within a. candida encoded proteins with unknown functions, however as described below, some families resembled proteins with functions previously associated with the elicitation of innate defence in plants and/or compatibility in plant-microbe interactions.

in order to identify the complement of pathogen associated molecular patterns  and effectors present in a. candida relative to other oomycetes we screened the predicted proteins in a manner similar to baxter et al.  <cit> . in general, the a. candida genome harbours fewer genes in each of the major classes of pamp or effector-like proteins .

cellulose binding elicitor lectin  is a cell wall glycoprotein from p. parasitica var nicotianae which can elicit host defences in nicotiana benthamiana  <cit> , and includes a family of  <dig> and  <dig> genes in p. sojae and p. ramorum, respectively  <cit> . only two genes in the h. arabidopsidis genome have been identified as encoding cbels  <cit> . the genome of a. candida also contains two putative cbel genes  which were identified based on sequence similarity to cbel from p. parasitica . ac2vrr-cbel <dig> has a signal peptide which may result in its secretion and its expression was detected to be higher during infection than in sporangiospores . by contrast ac2vrr-cbel <dig> does not contain a signal peptide indicating that it would be unlikely to be secreted and its expression was only detected in sporangiospores. alignment of ac2vrr-cbel <dig>  ac2vrr-cbel <dig> with cbel proteins from other oomycetes indicates that the canonical structure of cbels from phytophthora species is a sec-dependent secretion signal followed by interleaved cellulose binding  and apple domains which can mediate protein-protein or protein-carbohydrate interactions . examining the multiple sequence alignment and the molecular phylogeny of the oomycete cbels , variation is observed amongst cbel orthologs which appears to be conserved within oomycete genera. of note is that the cbel from the fish pathogen saprolengia parasitica has apple domains in locations which correspond to the location of the cbds in the plant pathogens. in tests performed using a transient assay in n. benthamiana with ac2vrr-cbel <dig>  we did not observe necrotic lesions . as can be seen from figure  <dig>  ac2vrr-cbel <dig> is missing the corresponding cbd <dig> domain relative to cbel from p. parasitica. gaulin and co-workers  <cit>  reported that mutations in any of the aromatic amino acids of either cbd <dig> or cbd <dig> disrupted the elicitor activity of pp-cbel. both cbel genes from h. arabidopsidis, another biotrophic oomycete, appear to lack regions corresponding to the second cbd domain and apple domains of cbel from p. parasitica.

elicitins belong to pamps from plant pathogenic oomycetes. elicitins are a highly conserved group of secreted proteins and includes members such as inf <dig>  a  <dig> kda protein from p. infestans that elicits host cell death in nicotiana benthamiana  <cit> . the presence of six cysteine residues is a common feature of elicitins and has been used to mine databases revealing  <dig> elicitins  or elicitin-like  genes from several phytophthora species  <cit> . following this precedent, we identified nine genes which were either annotated as elicitins via interproscan or had similarity to an ell . elicitin and elicitin-like genes were identified as being expressed in both cdna libraries and were similar to soj <dig>  soj <dig> and an elk gene ps-7-10d-zo, from p. sojae. additional sequence similarity for the a. candida elicitin-like genes was observed to p. citrophthora and inf <dig> from p. infestans.

necrosis and ethylene inducing peptides  are common among diverse groups of plant pathogens and are capable of triggering plant cell death  <cit> . except a. candida, all oomycetes with sequenced genomes have genes encoding neps. we performed sequence similarity searches with known nep proteins and searched the a. candida proteome using a hmm which has been used to recover nep proteins from phythophthora spp. and h. arabidopsidis. none of the methods, used to search for neps in a. candida, yielded any candidate genes.

rxlrs are a group of cytoplasmic effectors that are abundant in phytophthora species  <cit> . a. candida contains a small group of genes that encode secreted proteins with a variant rxlr motif . the number of ac-rxl effectors was estimated by string searches within the predicted proteins with amino-terminal signal peptides. the numbers of true positives were derived from subtraction of hmm searches of the permutated protein sequences  <cit> . we identified a total of  <dig> predicted gene models which contained a putative sec-dependent signal peptide, lacked homology to known proteins, and had an ac-rxl motif . the consensus ac-rxl domain in ac2vrr appears to be lsslrlsl, based on an analysis of the amino acid conservation in the subset of candidate proteins. ac2vrr-rxl- <dig> has an orf of  <dig> bps encoding a secreted protein of  <dig>  kda, with low-level expression detected by  <dig> clone in infected seedling library, and  <dig> clones in the sporangiospore library. the predicted signal peptide was located at the 18th amino acid . when the candidate ac2vrr-rxl- <dig> was transiently expressed in n. benthamiana leaves necrosis was visible at the site of infiltration. a series of eight additional candidate ac-rxls were tested for their ability to transiently induce necrosis when infiltrated into n. benthamiana. of these additional candidate ac-rxls, five were able to induce necrosis in n. benthamiana and three were not . further investigation is needed to determine the nature of necrosis induced in tobacco and to confirm each effector's function. conserved sequence modules termed in w-, y-, l- domains from the c-termini of rxlr proteins in phytophthora and hyaloperonospora have been described  <cit> . these domains have been shown to be involved in suppression host program cell death  <cit> . we searched the ac2vrr proteome with a set of hmm based on w-, y-, l- domains in the c-termini of rxlr proteins. none of these domains were detected in albugo, which supports the independent origin of albugo effectors in the evolution of biotrophy.

crns were first identified in phytophthora species as secreted proteins that have a conserved lflak motif downstream of the signal peptide  <cit> . homologues have been reported from h. arabidopsidis  <cit> , p. ultimum  <cit>  and aphanomyces euteiches  <cit> . crns have been proposed to be an ancient group of host-targeting proteins that evolved in the oomycete lineage. using a modified pattern based on the work of schornack and co-worker  <cit>  and custom hmms based on the conserved n-terminal domain containing the host-targeting motif flak, we identified six gene models as putative crns . the host targeting motif lylak in a. candida is slightly different than canonical crns. the a. candida crns form the largest secreted gene family in a. candida. by contrast to p. sojae, crn type effectors are not highly abundant in a. candida but are similar in number to p. ramorum. additionally the highest expression level we could detect was a single est clone for  <dig> of the  <dig> a. candida crns in either of our cdna libraries. we cloned five of the albugo predicted crns and transiently expressed them in n. benthamiana leaves. none of the crn induced any visible response in tobacco.

we systematically searched for novel host-targeting motifs amongst the proteins containing a sec-dependent secretion signal with the program meme  <cit> , allowing up to  <dig> motifs to be discovered simultaneously in the n-terminal 30- <dig> amino acids. one motif, chxc occurring in several proteins was recovered. the motif showed strong conservation with two cys residues . the meme output for the chxc motif was subsequently used for a hmm search in a. candida. in total,  <dig> chxc proteins were found; all of them had no detectable homolog in phytophthora or hyaloperonospora species. the high level of sequence divergence from other species is indicative of their specific adaptation in albugo species.

putative twin arginine translocase  secreted proteins
while the sec-dependent secretion system is capable of protein secretion, it is not able to maintain complex protein conformations during secretion  <cit> . the twin arginine translocation  system, which was first described in plants, appears to be competent for secreting folded proteins and protein complexes  <cit> . recent work has indicated that tat-secreted proteins can contribute to virulence in plant pathogens  <cit> . to date the description of functional tat secretion systems has been limited to bacterial plant pathogens, but there is evidence for the conservation of a component gene of the tat secretion system being present in p. infestans   <cit> . we identified a series of additional tat-c orthologs in the genomes of other oomycetes  by sequence similarity to the published p. infestans tat-c. these searches identified putative tat-c orthologs in four oomycete genera . tat-c genes are typically encoded within the mitochondrial genome and the sequence of the tat-c gene itself is highly homopolymeric. we could identify a fragment of a tat-c gene within the a. candida assembly but full resolution of the gene was not possible given that pyrosequencing data is poorly suited to the resolution of homo-polymeric regions. the tat secretion system recognizes a conserved signal peptide  and thus we used an in silico analysis of the proteomes of oomycetes to investigate whether tat-p signals were a common feature of the proteins within these organisms . the number of putative tat-p containing proteins in the ac2vrr genome was much reduced relative to the proteomes of other oomycetes  and the level of conservation of the tat-p motif was low across the sequenced oomycetes . there were  <dig> a. candida predicted genes that bore similarity to other oomycetes and the fact that there is a level of conservation amongst the oomycetes would suggest there may be a shared evolutionary lineage to some of these genes amongst oomycetes .

CONCLUSIONS
here we present a summary of the predicted repertoire of genes from albugo candida using transcript sequences and de novo sequence assembly of the pathogen genome. the historical reference isolate of a. candida  used for this investigation represents a major destructive pathogen in oilseed and vegetable production of brassica crops worldwide. previous pathology and molecular genetic studies using a. candida have been important for advancing our understanding of broad spectrum disease resistance and defence suppression in a. thaliana and the genetics of avirulence in a. candida  <cit> .

albugo candida is a member of the albuginales, which is comprised exclusively of obligate biotrophs that have adapted to a wide diversity of hosts  <cit> . this order is thought to have diverged early in oomycete evolution from other major plant pathogens including necrotrophic pythium species which are the basal lineage in the peronosporales, with respect to other hemi-biotrophic phytophthora species and obligate biotrophic downy mildews  <cit> . thus biotrophy has apparently evolved independently, in two major lineages of the oomycetes. oomycete genomes range in size from the smallest  <dig> mb genome of a necrotrophic pythium  <cit>  to the largest >  <dig> mb genome of potato late blight pathogen p. infestans  <cit> . the a. candida genome size  is significantly smaller than a comparable biotroph from the peronosporales such as h. arabidopsidis, a common parasite of a. thaliana in europe. similar to h. arabidopsidis  <cit>  and the obligate fungi  <cit> , a. candida is deficient for enzymes required for nitrate and sulphate assimilation and has a reduced number of cell wall degrading enzymes.

the most intriguing contrast found in the comparison of a. candida genome with other oomycetes is the low number of rxlr effector-like genes   <cit> . this relatively small gene family in a. candida may be due to weak selection pressure from the slow evolution of white rust resistance genes in the host, and/or an apparently minimal repertoire of effectors in a. candida that have been more effective in suppressing and avoiding host defences than in members of the peronosporales. the lack of rxlr genes in the genome of p. ultimum  <cit>  and their discovery in a variant  form in the a. candida genome suggest that this class of effectors may have evolved independently along with biotrophy in the two major lineages of plant pathogenic oomycetes. the potential function of candidate chxc proteins in a. candida also warrants further investigation as a potential novel class of effectors.

a similar conclusion can be drawn from other proteins that have previously been associated with pathogencity in plants. for example, neps found in many plant pathogens are capable of inducing cell death in plants  <cit> . the p. infestans and p. sojae genomes contain genes that encode  <dig> and  <dig> neps, respectively. nep expression levels in p. sojae correlates with a transition in disease development from biotrophy to necrotrophy  <cit> . we were unable to identify any nep orthologs in a. candida from the transcriptome or in the assembled genome sequence. the absence of nep genes in a. candida supports the suggestion of qutob and co-workers  <cit>  that neps are associated with necrotrophy. by contrast to the lack of neps in the a. candida genome the h. arabidopsidis genome contains  <dig> nep-like genes. however nep proteins in h. arabidopsidis show high sequence divergence, probably to avoid triggering necrosis response in host  <cit> .

albugo candida and p. infestans are also notably different in the respective number of elicitins and crinkler-like proteins encoded in each genome. we identified nine elicitin and elicitin-like genes in ac2vrr, far fewer than the  <dig> genes detected in phytophthora species  <cit> . crinklers are also highly abundant in phytophthora species with close to  <dig> genes reported for p. infestans  <cit> . phythophthora infestans crinkler proteins are typified by an amino-terminal lflak domain and are capable of inducing necrosis in planta  <cit> . while we were able to identify six crns in the a. candida genome none were detected as being highly expressed during infection or in sporangiospores and they did not induce necrosis in planta.

presence of tat-c orthologs and the conservation of tat-p containing proteins within the genomes of oomycetes are intriguing. in the case of albugo candida the tat-p containing complement of genes is reduced relative to other oomycetes and the genome appears to harbour a tat-c ortholog. while these observations of a putative tat secretion system within oomycetes are preliminary it forms an intriguing question for further investigation.

the differences in the repertoire of genes involved in pathogencity, between a. candida and other oomycetes indicate that a. candida is highly adapted to life as an obligate biotroph. amongst the canonical classes of pathogen effector molecules, many appear to be non-existent in the a. candida genome or represent significantly smaller classes of genes. our analysis of the a. candida genome provides a basis for investigating the relationship between an obligate biotroph and its host. in general, these results portray a remarkably small eukaryotic genome for an organism that has evolved intimate biotrophic relationships independently from other oomycete lineages and has adapted to diverse host species.
