BACKGROUND
adult cattle are the main reservoir for o <dig> and non-o <dig> stecs, bacteria that cause serious human disease outbreaks resulting in symptoms that include hemorrhagic colitis or hemolytic uremic syndrome. until recently, there have been no reports of o <dig> stec disease in mature cattle  <cit> , but stecs do affect calf health from birth to weaning  <cit> . stec infections cause high mortality in neonatal calves resulting from acute enteritis  <cit> . older calves have transient watery diarrhea but are not seriously affected by o <dig> stec infections, while this age class is susceptible to non-o <dig> stec infections  <cit> . the characteristic patchy attachment/effacement  lesions are always present in hemorrhaged tissues of humans  <cit> . these lesions are similarly found in the jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, and rectum in neonatal calves, but not in older calves  <cit> . the o <dig> stec can adhere to and form a/e lesions in intestinal tissue from mature cattle in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . if stecs do cause disease in mature cattle, the most likely candidates are diseases with unclear etiologies such as jhs  <cit> . current treatments for jhs include an aggressive medical and surgical therapy that can be effective, but the prognosis for long term survival relies upon early detection  <cit> . an alternative therapy for on-farm treatment is required for animals that are not detected or for rapidly developing cases. in monogastric livestock, prebiotic feed additives favor the growth of beneficial bacteria in the intestinal tract, remove pathogenic bacteria from the intestinal tract, increase cytokine levels and increase percentages of lymphocyte subpopulations suggestive of an overall health benefit  <cit> . very little information is available concerning the benefits of prebiotics for managing pathogens in beef cattle. the first objective of the current study was to characterize pathogen colonization in hemorrhaged jejunum of beef cattle during natural jhs outbreaks. the second objective was to confirm the association of mycotoxigenic fungi in feeds with the development of jhs and also to identify the presence of mycotoxins. the third objective was to determine the impact of a prebiotic, celmanax™, on the feed-associated mycotoxin cytotoxicity in vitro. the final objective was to determine if a prebiotic could modify the progression of disease in beef cattle.

RESULTS
pathology and impact of a prebiotic on animal health
the six samples of jejunum obtained from angus-cross beef cattle at a local abattoir had no pathology and no stec detected in the tissue. the single application of celmanax™ was associated with a rapid recovery in  <dig> hr for  <dig> of the  <dig> symptomatic beef feeder calves on bf <dig>  the recovered calves had no further health issues. five calves succumbed to the disease, but these calves had hindlimb paralysis within  <dig> hr of consuming the mouldy feed and did not regain their mobility. necropsy of the calves from bf <dig> revealed the presence of hemorrhaged tissue about  <dig> meter long in the jejunum for all five calves. there were also raised peyer's patches, severe focal hemorrhages, bloody digesta, mucosal erosions, dark-red erythema, large blood clots and edema. the hemorrhages and blood-filled distended loops were visible through the serosa. in contrast, necropsy of finishing beef cattle from bf <dig> revealed the same pathology but with smaller blood clots than observed in bf <dig> samples. the severe hemorrhaging and distended loops of blood were not visible through the serosa, perhaps because of the severity of edema. the pathology identified in the jejunal samples from bf <dig> and bf <dig> confirm the jhs diagnosis.

stec isolation from the jejunum of jhs cases
adherent non-sorbitol fermenting colonies were identified at significant levels colonizing the hemorrhaged regions of the jejunum from bf <dig> relative to the control animals . there was about a  <dig> fold higher stec colonization of the mucosal tissue in the finishing cattle  compared with the beef feeder calves . similarly, there was  <dig> fold higher stec in the bloody digesta for the finishing cattle  compared with the beef feeder calves . there were also sorbitol-fermenting colonies that represented about 50% of the cfu/sample/site but we did not initially suspect them as non-o <dig> stecs. the non-sorbitol fermenting bacterial isolates were confirmed as o <dig> and h <dig> using the rim™ e. coli o157:h <dig> latex test. the sorbitol fermenting colonies weakly agglutinated using the rim™ e. coli o157:h <dig> latex test. the stec isolates were examined for the expression of stx, as this is a key virulence trait associated with more severe forms of animal disease. the isolates produced stx <dig> and stx <dig>  the consistent presence of significant numbers of stec in the hemorrhaged regions for cattle with jhs regardless of the feedlot, suggests that the stecs warrant further investigation as causative agents.

isolation of bacterial pathogens from the jejunum of jhs cases
chromagar™ is a selective media used for presumptive identification of specific pathogens including salmonella, e. coli, e. coli o <dig> and listeria  <cit> . presumptive e. coli o <dig> were identified and appeared as regular mauve colonies  or navy blue colonies with a mauve halo  on chromagar™ o <dig> plates. presumptive e. coli o <dig> were confirmed as pathogenic e. coli in the gn-id a + b test. other presumptive pathogenic e. coli appeared as blue colonies on chromagar™ e. coli plates. all e. coli were confirmed as non-pathogenic e. coli in the gn-id a + b test. white colonies were also found on this plate that were mauve on chromagar™ o <dig> plates and were identified as pathogenic e. coli in the gn-id a + b test. this provided a crosscheck for the results from the chromagar™ o <dig> plates and for the non-sorbitol or sorbitol-fermenting colonies. presumptive salmonella were identified and appeared as mauve colonies on chromagar™ salmonella plus plates, but were subsequently determined as false positives . no listeria species were identified. no clostridium perfringens was detected. thus, the only bacterial pathogen identified in the hemorrhaged tissues or bloody digesta for beef cattle with jhs regardless of the feedlot, were stecs.

dna microarray assay targeting e. coli genes
the results from the bacterial isolations from the smac, ct-smac and chromagar™ o <dig> plates suggested that the tissues had at least two types of stec present, o <dig> and non-o <dig>  there were two distinct morphologies on the chromagar™ o <dig> plates: mauve colonies with a circular form, raised elevation and entire margin; blue colonies with a mauve halo that had a circular form, raised elevation and an entire margin. these colonies were non-sorbitol and sorbitol fermenting with both types of stecs tellurite-resistant. the dna microarray assay confirmed the presence of the non-o <dig> stec in the hemorrhaged tissues and these isolates have the locus of enterocyte effacement  pathogenicity island, stx1a, stx1b and hlya. finally, in addition to the genes mentioned above, variability in the presence of other virulence genes also supports the notion of a mixed stec population.

interestingly, the absence of the stx <dig> gene in the characterized isolates suggests that the detected stx <dig> from the isolate and blood samples may represent a strain that was not ultimately isolated or the loss of genes from sub-culturing procedures  <cit> .

mycotoxigenic fungi in silages and tissues
there were no visible hyphae  or fungal growth from tissues of the beef calves or finishing beef cattle. fusarium species were present in the digesta of the hemorrhaged regions from the cattle with jhs. there was no aspergillus fumigatus present in the feed samples from bf <dig>  but it was present in the barley silage from bf <dig>  there were several other types of mycotoxigenic fungi present in the barley silage from bf <dig> including f. verticillioides, f. sporotrichioides and p. roqueforti . the hay from bf <dig> also had mycotoxigenic fungi present, f. poae and p. roqueforti. no mycotoxigenic fungi were detected in other feed components from bf <dig>  the barley silage from bf <dig> had two mycotoxigenic fungi present, f. verticillioides and p. roqueforti .

lawn assay for cytotoxicity associated with feed extracts
for bf <dig>  the extracts from the  <dig> barley silage had a higher cytotoxicity score  compared with the  <dig> barley silage that had no activity. interestingly, the hay extracts from bf <dig> had a high cytotoxicity score  equivalent to those reported with similar jhs outbreaks in  <dig> dairy production sites in southern alberta  <cit> . all other feed components from bf <dig> had no detectable cytotoxicity. the barley silage from bf <dig> had a lower cytotoxicity score  compared with the hay in bf <dig>  the cytotoxicity scores were pooled for all feed samples having activity and are presented in figure  <dig>  the inclusion of  <dig> % concentration of celmanax™ removed the cytotoxicity associated with all extracts regardless of the production site .

discussion
jhs is a hemorrhagic disease in dairy and beef cattle with the main pathology presenting as hemorrhaging, severe inflammation, mucosal erosion and large blood clots in the jejunum  <cit> . initially, two factors, mouldy feed containing a. fumigatus and a pathogen, c. perfringens type a, were being investigated as causative agents  <cit> . we recently expanded the disease complex to include mycotoxins and stecs based on a study of jhs cases from five dairy production sites  <cit> . the current study confirmed earlier reports suggesting that c. perfringens type a was not involved  <cit> . the pathologies observed in the beef cattle in this study are the same as those reported in other jhs cases  <cit>  and as described for o <dig> stec infections in experimental challenged beef cattle that were persistent shedders  <cit> . similarly, the amount of stec colonization detected in this study and a previous study with dairy cattle are equivalent to that described for o <dig> stec infections in experimental challenged beef cattle that were persistent shedders  <cit> . together these studies support further investigation of stecs as part of the disease complex for jhs. aspergillus fumigatus was reported to infect tissues in dairy cattle with jhs and it was suggested that the a. fumigatus infection deposited mycotoxins in the blood that then contributes to the development of jhs  <cit> . we did find low levels of a. fumigatus in the feed from bf <dig>  but not for bf <dig> or other production sites where natural jhs outbreaks occurred  <cit> . in support of a lesser role for the fungi in the disease complex, we also did not confirm tissue infections. future studies should examine the type and concentration of mycotoxins in feed components together with stec colonization of hemorrhaged tissues in cattle to confirm their role in jhs.

the dominant fungi found in the hay or silages in this study were f. poae which produce t- <dig> toxins and f. sporotrichioides which produce fumonisins  <cit> . both mycotoxins were identified at significant levels in feed components consumed by dairy cattle that developed jhs and this corresponded to a high cytotoxicity score   <cit> . the co-occurrence of hemorrhaging in the intestinal tract of cattle with the consumption of t- <dig> or fumonisin contaminated feeds suggests that the mycotoxins could be a factor in the development of jhs. however, experimental challenge studies with t- <dig> in cattle determined that this material caused severe congestion of the mucosa, congestion of the villar tips and severe congestion of the vasculature in the lamina propria of the jejunum, but no hemorrhaging  <cit> . similarly, fumonisin b <dig> is cytotoxic to epithelial cells, inhibits immune function, promotes a loss in mucosal barrier function, causes diarrhea and abdominal pain, but does not cause hemorrhaging  <cit> . this suggests that the mycotoxins could have a role in promoting pathogen colonization in cattle by providing colonization niches, toxin entry into the submucosa or blood stream and preventing early recognition of an infection. in human infections, early non-intimate stec colonization is important and clinically is characterized by non-bloody diarrhea. an odd diarrhea was a common symptom reported by the producers at the beef production sites in this study and in earlier dairy cattle studies  <cit> . in both studies, the consistent co-occurrence of high cytotoxicity scores or "mycotoxin content" in one or more feed components supports a role for mycotoxins in the disease complex for jhs. as stec colonization progresses in human infections, intimate-attachment and stx production contribute to the development of severe hemorrhaging. cattle do not have the appropriate receptors to facilitate stx entry, but it is possible that the types of damage reported for the mucosal exposure to mycotoxins such as t- <dig> or fumonisin could provide the mechanism for toxin activities  <cit> . future studies should examine the interaction of specific mycotoxins and stec in cattle to determine if these factors elicit disease.

antibiotic treatment for stec infections in humans does not change stec colonization or development of more serious forms of disease. more importantly, the administration of some types of antibiotics such as trimethoprim, increases the expression of stxs resulting in faster development of disease  <cit> . a common comment from producers that have experienced jhs outbreaks is that antibiotics were ineffective and if anything the clinical symptoms worsened after treatment  <cit> . in southern alberta, trivetrin that contains trimethoprim is commonly used to treat cattle ailments such as diarrhea suggesting that the administration of this antibiotic early in the infection process may have contributed to the development of jhs, but also to stec carriage. the novel prebiotic treatment used in this study resulted in 69% recovery of the symptomatic beef calves. since the prebiotic acts as an anti-adhesive for stec colonization and a mycotoxin binder in vitro, the results suggest that the benefit to the calves could have been derived from preventing mycotoxin:stec interactions  <cit> . future studies should determine whether prebiotic treatments could be used to manage jhs cases.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study confirmed that mycotoxins and stec are part of the disease complex for jhs in beef cattle. we did not confirm a role for c. perfringens type a or mycotoxigenic fungi in jhs. a prebiotic treatment alleviated the development of disease in symptomatic beef calves. future studies should examine the role of stecs and mycotoxins in the infection process that leads to jhs and the mode of action of prebiotics.
