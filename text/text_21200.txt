BACKGROUND
culturable haemophilus influenzae are acquired in the nasopharynx shortly after birth, and are thought to persist throughout life. h. influenzae adheres to and penetrates into and between cultured human respiratory epithelial cells, a mechanism that may contribute to its persistence in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and cystic fibrosis  patients  <cit> . h. influenzae can be found in the respiratory tracts of these patients even after they have undergone antibiotic treatment  <cit> . as well, copd sputum cultures can be sterile, while h. influenzae can still be isolated from the subepithelial matrix  <cit> . finally, we have found in a recent in vivo study that h. influenzae can persist in a human bronchiolar xenograft for at least three weeks  <cit> . this suggests that the organism can survive and persist in protected biological compartment.

the ability of h. influenzae to survive antibiotic treatment and reappear when growth is favorable may be responsible for the reseeding of the middle ear observed in chronic otitis media. often, middle ear fluid from children presenting with otitis media with effusion are sterile when cultured, but pcr analysis of the fluid has determined the presence of h. influenzae  <cit> . further, rt-pcr studies of this sterile fluid have shown the presence of bacterial mrna, confirming that the bacteria are alive and persisting in a viable but nonreplicative state  <cit> .

persistence was investigated in vitro using a nthi strain that was susceptible to β-lactam antibiotics. this strain was allowed to invade a human respiratory epithelial cell monolayer for  <dig> hours, which was subsequently treated with a  <dig> hour incubation in  <dig> × mic concentrations of the β-lactam antibiotics ampicillin, imipenem, cefuroxim, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, or cephalothin. the antibiotics killed all the extracellular bacteria, but none of the intra- or paracellular bacteria, suggesting that the organism was not replicating inside or between the epithelial cells  <cit> . non-replicating bacteria are not susceptible to the cidal action of β-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics.

during a study aimed at identifying genes associated with virulence in pathogenic strains of the gram-negative, strict anaerobe dichelobacter nodosus, the causative agent of ovine footrot, katz et al.  <cit>  reported the discovery of a novel area of the chromosome that hybridized to all virulent strains tested, but to only 23% of the avirulent strains studied. they designated the four genes found on this fragment as vapa-d, for virulence-associated proteins. homologues of these genes appear on the chromosomes and plasmids of a number of pathogenic microorganisms, including neisseria gonorrhoeae, helicobacter pylori, reimerella anatipestifer and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the chromosome of h. influenzae strain rd kw <dig>  contains vapa, vapbc, and vapd homologues, with one pair, vapbc, in duplicate. the genome organization of the vap genes in h. influenzae differs from that of d. nodosus, in that vapahi  is preceded by a conserved hypothetical protein, hi <dig>  and both genes are likely transcribed as an operon. as well, vapdhi is flanked by a gene encoding another conserved hypothetical protein, hi <dig> , again in an apparent operon configuration . to determine if the vap homologues played a role in the persistence of nthi, we chose vapdhi  for further study, since this protein was found in a proteomic survey to be expressed in the soluble fraction of strain rd  <cit> . vapdhi is 40% identical and 67% similar to the dichelobacter vapd and belongs to the cluster of orthologous groups   <dig> and pfam  <dig>  termed the "n-terminal conserved domain of vapd".

RESULTS
mutation of vapdhi results in attenuated survival in human endothelial cells
when the rd vapdhi mutant strain was used to invade the in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier, human brain microvascular endothelial cells  in 12-well plates, the amount of gentamicin-resistant bacteria recovered from the monolayer after three hours declined to approximately 60% of wild type levels, an average of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml for the wild-type strain rd versus  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml for the rd vapdhi mutant ; p <  <dig> , student's t test). no significant difference was observed between the wild type and vapdhi mutant in adherence to the human cell monolayers: the average number of cell-associated bacteria  recovered for strain rd was  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml for the rd vapdhi mutant .

to determine if the phenotype of attenuated survival observed in the rd vapdhi mutant was a general phenomenon and not restricted to strain rd, another isogenic pair was constructed and analyzed using a different strain, r <dig>  r <dig> is a bronchoalveolar lavage isolate from a pediatric cystic fibrosis patient, and is considered invasive since it came from a normally sterile site  <cit> . the average number of gentamicin-resistant bacteria recovered from hbmec monolayers was  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml for the parent strain r <dig> versus  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml for the r <dig> vapdhi mutant . although the absolute numbers of bacteria recovered were higher with strain r <dig> than with rd , the attenuation of survival inside the hbmec monolayer of ≤ 60% observed in the strain with a vapdhi mutation was maintained. there was no significant difference between the wild-type r <dig> and the r <dig> vapdhi mutant in adherence to the monolayer: the average numbers of cell-associated bacteria recovered for strain r <dig> were  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml versus  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml for r <dig> vapdhi . unlike rd, strain r <dig> carries the high molecular weight  adhesins, which may account for its more efficient adherence to the hbmec monolayer  <cit> . no significant difference in the growth rates of either of the vapdhi mutants versus their cognate parent strains were observed, whether grown in bacteriological media  or on hbmec or nci-h <dig> monolayers .

mutation of vapdhi results in diminished long-term survival inside human respiratory epithelial cells
to determine if the vapdhi mutation would affect the ability of h. influenzae to survive inside human respiratory epithelial cells over a longer period of time, 18-hour invasion assays were performed using nci-h <dig> cells. the number of gentamicin-resistant bacteria recovered from the nci-h <dig> monolayer after  <dig> hours for the parent strain rd was an average of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml versus  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml for the rd vapdhi mutant . this represents a 50% reduction in survival of the vapdhi mutant within epithelial cells as compared to the parent strain, more attenuation than was seen for the three hour assays.

transcomplementation of rd vapdhi
the vapdhi locus from strain r <dig> was cloned into the mobilizable broad host range plasmid pdd <dig>  creating pdd <dig>  and conjugally transferred into the rd vapdhi mutant . the plasmid pdd <dig> is a derivative of the incq plasmid rsf <dig> and has an approximate copy number of  <dig> per chromosome in h. influenzae  <cit> . the survival inside hbmec of strain rd  was within 5% of strain rd without the vector in identical assays . carrying a vapdhi locus in trans restored wild-type survival of rd vapdhi  within hbmec monolayers. the amount of gentamicin-resistant bacteria recovered from the endothelial cell monolayer after a three hour invasion assay was an average of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml for rd , the vector control, and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml for the mutant strain that carried the wild-type vapdhi allele in trans, rd vapdhi  , indicating that there was no significant difference in the survival inside hbmec monolayers of the wild type strain versus the transcomplemented strain. these data confirm that the phenotype of attenuated survival was due to the interruption in vapdhi and not to polar effects.

the r <dig> vapdhi mutant mirrored the survival defect seen with the rd vapdhi mutant, at approximately 60% of wild-type r <dig> levels. however, attempts to conjugate the mobilizable broad host range plasmid carrying the vapdhi locus, pdd <dig>  into strain r <dig> for transcomplementation studies failed repeatedly. this clinical isolate likely has a plasmid or an origin of replication of the same incompatibility group incorporated into its chromosome and therefore will not maintain the broad host range plasmid for transcomplementation  <cit> .

reverse-transcriptase pcr of bacteria from human cell monolayers
to determine if the vapdhi locus was transcribed during contact with a human cell monolayer, total rna was isolated from the wild-type strain rd recovered after  <dig> hours on hbmec or nci-h <dig> monolayers and was used as the template for rt-pcr. figure  <dig> shows the  <dig> bp band amplified with the vapdhi-specific primers, with a molecular weight marker in lane a. the template for lane b is rd rna from hbmec endothelial cell monolayers, lane c is its cognate negative control, with no reverse transcriptase added to the rna prior to pcr amplification. lane d shows the results using rd rna from nci-h <dig> epithelial cell monolayers; lane e is its cognate negative control. the vapdhilocus is transcribed when strain rd is in contact with either human epithelial or endothelial cell monolayers.

pcr survey of vapdhi
in order to estimate the carriage rate of vapdhi among the highly heterologous nthi strains, a pcr survey of  <dig> commensal and disease-associated strains was undertaken . the vaphi primer set was used. in rd, these primers amplify a  <dig> bp pcr product that includes the full-length vapdhi gene.

purified chromosomal dna preparations from  <dig> randomly-chosen nthi strains and one each of the six capsular serotypes of h. influenzae  from the american type culture collection  reference strains described in table  <dig> were subjected to pcr with the vaphi forward and reverse primers. the nthi strains included nasopharyngeal, blood, csf, middle ear, tracheal aspirate, and sputum isolates. a pcr product was amplified in 100% of the strains. all of the atcc encapsulated reference strains and rd displayed a full-length vapdhiallele. ninety-three percent of the nasopharyngeal strains carried a full-length allele, as did 71% of the blood and csf isolates, and 50% of the middle ear, tracheal aspirate, and sputum isolates. overall, only ten strains of the  <dig> included in the study displayed a truncated gene.

sequencing of the truncated vapdhi allele
to study the truncated vapdhi in more detail, five out of the ten alleles that represented the smaller isoform of vapdhi from the pcr survey were sequenced on both strands. it was found that, in all cases, the gene had undergone a deletion event that had left the protein in frame, but missing  <dig> amino acids from the interior of the protein, resulting in a  <dig> amino acid protein rather than the full-length  <dig> amino acid protein . this corresponds to the loss of rd genome coordinates  <dig> to  <dig>  in addition, all of the smaller alleles had an aspartate residue inserted at position # <dig> as compared to rd, which has a leucine at that position. the significance of this is unclear, as the full-length r <dig> vapdhi allele, which did transcomplement the rd vapdhi mutant, also has an aspartic acid inserted at the same position, resulting in a  <dig> amino acid protein. interestingly, the vapd homologues from n. gonorrhoeae, h. pylori and a. actinomycetemcomitans, as well as vapd in d. nodosus, all have an aspartate at that position. rd appears to be the only h. influenzae strain studied which lacks that particular residue.

full-length vapdhi homodimerizes
using an e. coli-based protein-protein interaction system that is dependent upon the dna-binding domain  of lexa, homodimerization of identical protein subunits can be quantitated  <cit> . in this system, protein-protein interactions result in a lexa dimer that is active as a repressor, and consequently, the beta-galactosidase activity of the reporter strain  diminishes. full-length vapdhi from strain r <dig> was ligated to the dbd of lexa in plasmid pdd <dig> and the clones were analyzed on macconkey agar with lactose. if there was no homodimerization of the lexa::vapdhi fusion protein, the colonies appeared red on macconkey agar, as the native level of beta-galactosidase expression in the reporter strain was not inhibited. if the subunits interacted, the colonies appeared pale on macconkey, as the engineered lexa operator controlling the lacz reporter gene had been repressed by a homodimer of the lexa fusion protein. this repression was quantitated by beta-galactosidase activity assays. each measurement is the mean of at least three experiments performed in triplicate.

it was found that vapdhi interacted strongly with itself. the beta-galactosidase activity of the reporter strain su <dig> carrying the vector control  was an average of  <dig>  miller units, and the activity of su <dig> with the lexa::vapdhi fusion  was an average of  <dig>  miller units, indicating strong interaction. full-length vapdhi forms homodimers in vivo. this protein may also form higher-order multimers, since this would result in a number of dimeric forms being available to act as a repressor of lacz transcription in the reporter strain.

truncated vapdhi does not homodimerize, but interacts with full-length vapdhi
homodimerization assays with the small allele revealed that the subunits of the truncated vapdhi did not interact efficiently. the vector control for the homodimerization assays su <dig>  yielded  <dig>  miller units, and su <dig> carrying the lexa fusion to the truncated vapdhi protein from strain r <dig>  displayed  <dig>  miller units of beta-galactosidase activity, showing little repression in this system.

since the wild-type vapdhi subunits homodimerized strongly but the truncated subunits did not, the truncated subunit and the full-length subunit were examined for interaction in heterodimerization assays. in the reporter strain su <dig>  a lexa operator with a mutated half-site was engineered upstream of the lacz gene. this strain was then transformed with two compatible plasmids, one that carried a fusion of the truncated vapdhi with a wild-type lexa dbd, and one that carried the full-length vapdhi fusion to a mutated lexa dbd that only recognized the mutated lexa operator half-site in su <dig>  <cit> . if a heterodimer of a truncated subunit and a full-length subunit was formed, a functional lexa repressor could recognize the hybrid operator and repress transcription of lacz. it was determined that the truncated and full-length subunits could interact with each other. the vector control for the heterodimerization assays  yielded  <dig> ±  <dig> miller units, and su <dig> carrying the lexa fusion to the truncated vapdhi protein from strain r <dig>  pdd <dig>  coupled with the mutated lexa dbd fusion to the full-length vapdhi protein from strain r <dig>  pdd <dig>  resulted in  <dig> ±  <dig> miller units of beta-galactosidase activity, showing that the truncated subunit did heterodimerize with the full-length vapdhi subunit.

truncated vapdhi does not transcomplement the mutant and has a dominant-negative effect in the wild-type strain
to investigate whether the truncated vapdhi protein could transcomplement a mutation in the full-length gene, the truncated locus from strain r <dig> was cloned into the mobilizable broad host range vector pdd <dig>  creating pdd <dig>  and conjugally transferred into the rd vapdhi mutant strain. three-hour survival assays using hbmec monolayers were performed, and the number of gentamicin-resistant bacteria recovered from the monolayer was an average of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml for rd , the vector control, versus  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml for rd vapdhi . survival in hbmec by the mutant strain did not increase to wild-type levels, as was the case with the rd vapdhi mutant transcomplemented with a full-length vapdhi allele on pdd <dig> 

since subunits of the full-length vapdhi and the truncated protein interacted, the plasmid pdd <dig> carrying the truncated allele was conjugally transferred into wild-type strain rd to determine whether expression of the small protein would interfere with the function of the wild-type vapdhi protein. the strain was used in three-hour assays of hbmec monolayers, and it was found that rd  was attenuated in human cell survival as compared to rd , the wild-type strain carrying the vector without an insert. the average number of gentamicin-resistant bacteria recovered from the monolayer for rd , the vector control, was  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml versus  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml for rd  . the in trans expression of a truncated vapdhi allele in the wild-type strain rd resulted in a dominant-negative effect on survival within hbmec monolayers.

expression of vapdhi in escherichia coli dh5α results in cell growth arrest
to test the hypothesis that vapdhi constituted the toxin, and that vapxhi encoded the antitoxin portion of a ta locus, both proteins were expressed in an e. coli background. e. coli does not contain a homologue of either protein. initially, the vapdhi gene, hi <dig>  was cloned into the ptrchisa vector . this resulted in vapdhi being under the control of the strong ptrc promoter, which is repressed for the most part until induced by iptg. this plasmid was designated pdd <dig>  both the vector control, dh5α , and dh5α  were grown to mid-log phase in lb broth with  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin and aliquots were spread on lb agar plates with  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin and  <dig>  mm iptg. strain dh5α  grew on the plates, but dh5α  did not, indicating that induction and overexpression of vapdhi was toxic to e. coli. the putative antitoxin vapxhi, was then cloned into the ptrchisa vector. no growth disruption occurred in dh5α with the overexpression of vapxhi alone. the vapxhi gene plus the laciq gene were then subcloned into the broad host range mobilizable plasmid, pdd <dig>  resulting in pdd <dig>  this strategy allowed the dh5α test strain to carry two compatible plasmids, one which encoded the vapdhi gene  and the other expressing the vapxhi antitoxin gene . both genes were under the control of a ptrc promoter and were therefore both repressed until induced by iptg. when both genes were induced with  <dig>  mm iptg on lb agar plates that contained  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin and  <dig> μg/ml chloramphenicol in strain dh5α , growth was restored. this indicated that the concurrent expression of the vapxhi antitoxin with the vapdhi toxin ameliorated the cell growth arrest observed with expression of vapdhi alone, and that vapxhi was necessary for this rescue.

discussion
mutation of the vapdhi allele in strains rd and r <dig> resulted in attenuation of survival within both hbmec and nci-h <dig> monolayers, suggesting that in h. influenzae, the presence of a functional vapdhi facilitates persistence within epithelial and endothelial cells. mutants invaded and survived in human cells at ≤ 60% of wild-type levels. although relatively modest, this level of attenuation has been observed during the mutational analysis of other haemophilus virulence factors, such as opacity-associated protein a as well as the high molecular weight  proteins  <cit> . h. influenzae survival within human cells is multifactorial, and our data indicate that vapdhi contributes to this process. however, strain rd contains three other vap genes , and it is possible that these haemophilus vap genes act synergistically, such that multiple mutations may result in a more attenuated survival phenotype. indeed, a recent study has determined that a chromosomally-located homologue of the vapbc locus acts as a toxin-antitoxin module in the spirochete leptospira interrogans  <cit> . it would be interesting to characterize a haemophilus strain with mutations in all the vap genes.

neither of the vapdhi mutants displayed differences in adherence to the monolayers compared to the parent strain, so the defect occurred after binding and affected the organism's ability to persist inside or between cells. interestingly, the vapdhi mutants were not attenuated in growth rate when compared to the parent strains, either in bacteriological media or on the surface of human cell monolayers. the observed survival attenuation of the mutants could be transcomplemented with a full-length allele from a clinical isolate, r <dig>  demonstrating that the phenotype was due to the mutation in vapdhi and not polar effects. a truncated allele from another clinical isolate, r <dig>  did not transcomplement the rd vapdhi strain, indicating that the truncated protein was not functional in vivo. rt-pcr analysis confirmed that the full-length vapdhi locus in rd was transcribed during contact with both epithelial and endothelial cells. vapdhi has also been identified in the soluble fraction of strain rd grown in bacteriological media  <cit> . it remains to be seen if the transcription of this locus increases upon contact with human cells.

results of a pcr survey on  <dig> randomly-chosen strains showed that nearly all of the genetically highly heterologous nthi commensal isolates surveyed  carried a full-length vapdhi allele on their chromosomes, suggesting that maintenance of a functional vapdhi gene was beneficial to survival in this niche . of the invasive strains isolated from the blood or cerebrospinal fluid, 71% retained a full-length allele. fifty percent of the isolates from sputum, tracheal aspirates, and the middle ear carried the full-length allele. finally, all the encapsulated strains tested contained a full-length allele. it must be noted, however, that this analysis was not an exhaustive study, since a limited number of strains were included. many clinical nthi strains have previously been shown to express various virulence factors that enhance adherence and invasion into human cells which are not found in the sequenced rd strain  <cit> . the strains identified in this pcr study that lack a functional vapdhi allele probably compensate for its loss with genes that are not found in rd, and these "extra genes" may well include other ta loci.

the calculated molecular mass of the vapdhi protein in rd is approximately  <dig> kilodaltons, and small bacterial proteins often form multimers. full-length vapdhi subunits exhibited strong homodimerization in a lexa-based protein-protein interaction system, and this may indicate that the subunits form higher-order multimers such as homotrimers or homotetramers in vivo. however, the protein encoded by the truncated allele did not homodimerize in the same system, further evidence of its loss of function. interestingly, the truncated subunit did interact with full-length subunits in heterodimerization assays. further evidence of this heterodimerization in vivo was that the expression of the truncated subunit in the wild-type strain resulted in a dominant-negative effect on survival within hbmec monolayers, the levels of which mimicked the attenuation observed with the vapdhi mutation. this was likely due to truncated subunits forming hybrid complexes with full-length subunits and interfering with their structure and/or function, resulting in the observed dominant-negative phenotype.

the activities of only a few toxins encoded by ta loci have been elucidated thus far. two specific targets of plasmid-encoded toxins have been identified: ccdb of the f plasmid and pare of plasmid rk <dig> inhibit dna gyrase, and kid of plasmid r <dig> was previously thought to interact with dnab helicase, but has recently been shown to cleave cellular mrna  <cit> . the target and function of a toxin from a chromosomally-encoded ta locus  was determined to be cleavage of mrna in the ribosomal a site  <cit> . strain rd contains relbe homologues  as well as a homologue of higa  from plasmid rts <dig>  the higba ta locus is unusual in that the toxin gene  exists upstream of the antidote protein . interestingly, vapahi of strain rd is 29% identical and 53% similar to higa.

while the data acquired in this study suggests that vapdhi and vapxhi form a toxin-antitoxin pair, it is unusual to find homologues of vapxhi only in h. influenzae and the gonococcal plasmid. h. influenzae strains r <dig> and r <dig> both have a truncated vapdhi toxin gene, and possess a vapxhi which is 100% identical to that gene in strain rd. their respective genomes can be searched at . interestingly, there are complete genome sequences available for two isolates of h. pylori, n. meningitidis and haemophilus somnus, but only one strain of each has a homologue of vapdhi. thus, several features of the vapdhi/vapxhi gene pair are unusual for a toxin-antitoxin locus.

CONCLUSIONS
persistence of nthi is important in the progression of disease caused by this organism. many investigators have previously reported the discovery of a number of virulence factors associated with adherence, invasion and survival of nthi inside human cells  <cit> . here we report a locus that is also involved in the pathogenesis of nontypeable h. influenzae. further studies are required to fully characterize the mechanism of vapdhi function and to define its role in the modulation of nthi persistence in human cells.
