BACKGROUND
domoic acid  is an excitatory amino acid analogue of kainic acid  that acts through glutamate receptors to elicit a rapid and potent excitotoxic response, resulting in prolonged receptor activation, tonic depolarization and neuronal hyperexcitability, excessive ca2+ influx, and ultimately widespread neuronal loss  <cit> . several studies have reported that the toxicity of da is mainly mediated by the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid /ka receptor in immature and mature neurons and glia from rat cerebellum  <cit> . furthermore, giordano et al.  <cit>  reported that an ampa/ka receptor antagonist, but not an n-methyl-d-aspartate  receptor antagonist, prevents da-induced apoptosis in primary cultures of granule cells from mouse cerebellum.

the induction of neuronal cell death by da in vitro is mediated by an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species   <cit> . ros are known to stimulate a number of events and pathways that lead to apoptosis, including mitogen-activated protein kinase  signal transduction pathways  <cit> . in neuronal cells, p <dig> mapk is preferentially activated by environmental stress and inflammatory cytokines, and it has been shown to promote neuronal cell death in vitro <cit> . a recent study demonstrated that da-induced cell death in primary neuronal cultures involves activation of p <dig> mapk, and antioxidants prevented p <dig> mapk phosphorylation  <cit> . collectively, these lines of evidence suggest that da induces ros generation followed by p <dig> mapk phosphorylation in vitro. in some studies, the hippocampus has been identified as a target site with high sensitivity to da-induced toxicity  <cit> . a recent study demonstrated that abnormal ros levels in the hippocampus of da-treated mice activate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-jun amino-terminal kinase  pathway in vivo <cit> , but no studies have investigated ros-mediated p <dig> mapk signal transduction pathways in the hippocampus after administration of da.

the wd <dig> repeat present in some proteins is a small structural motif of approximately  <dig> amino acids, typically bracketed by glycine-histidine and tryptophan-aspartate   <cit> . repeated wd <dig> motifs form a domain called the wd domain that is involved in protein-protein interactions. proteins with wd <dig> repeats have important roles in a variety of cellular functions such as cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis, and intracellular signal transduction  <cit> . wd repeat-containing protein  <dig>  is a novel member of this protein family  <cit> . in a mouse mutation screen for developmental phenotypes, mill et al.  <cit>  identified a mutation in the wdr <dig> gene as a cause of midgestation lethality associated with abnormalities characteristic of defects in the hedgehog signaling pathway. recently, we cloned rat wdr <dig>  also referred to as naofen  <cit> . very recently, we have found that bupivacaine, a local anesthetic, increases intracellular ros levels and activates p <dig> mapk in mouse neuroblastoma neuro2a cells, resulting in apoptosis via an increase in the expression of wdr <dig> .

in the present study, we identified and quantified da in the brains of rats after intraperitoneal da administration by using liquid chromatography/ion trap tandem mass spectrometry  analysis. we also performed histological examinations of the hippocampus after intraperitoneal da administration in rats and investigated the potential involvement of glutamate receptors, ros, p <dig> mapk, and wdr <dig> in da-induced toxicity.

RESULTS
identification and quantification of da in the rat brain by lc-ms/ms analysis
lc-ms/ms analysis was performed to confirm that intraperitoneally administered da reached the brain. the peak of the da standard was detected at a retention time of  <dig>  min under the lc conditions used in this experiment, and the full-scan mass spectrum showed the exclusive presence of the + ion at m/z  <dig> . the ms/ms product ion spectra of da, obtained using the + ion at m/z  <dig> as precursor, showed three fragment ions at m/z  <dig>  m/z  <dig>  and m/z  <dig>  as an example, an accumulated reconstructed ion chromatogram  of the three product ions  and the ms/ms spectrum  for a  <dig> ng/ml standard da solution are shown. representative lc-ms/ms analysis of a brain sample from a rat obtained at  <dig> min after intraperitoneal injection of  <dig> mg/kg da shows the same retention time  as that of the standard da  and the presence of three diagnostic fragment ions  with the ion abundance ratios fully consistent with those of the standard da, thus confirming the presence of da in this brain sample.


recovery tests were performed for quantification of the concentrations of da in brain samples. the recovery of da from brain samples spiked with  <dig> ng/g of da was examined by calculating the ratio of the amount of analyte recovered after purification with the c <dig> cartridge column to the amount originally added. overall recoveries and coefficients of variation were found to be satisfactory; these values were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . the mean concentration of da in rat brain samples obtained at  <dig> min after intraperitoneal administration of  <dig> mg/kg da was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/g .

histological examination of the ca <dig> region of rat hippocampus following da administration
since lc-ms/ms analysis confirmed the distribution of intraperitoneally administered da  to the brain, we carried out histological examinations of the ca <dig> region of the rat hippocampus at  <dig> hours after da administration. hematoxylin-eosin staining showed no neurodegenerative changes such as neuronal shrinkage and cell dropout in the ca <dig> region after vehicle  administration . in contrast, neuronal shrinkage  and cell dropout  were observed after da administration . as giordano et al.  <cit>  reported that da induces apoptosis in primary cultures of mouse neurons, we used tunel staining to examine whether intraperitoneal da at  <dig> mg/kg induces apoptosis in the ca <dig> region of the rat hippocampus. tunel-positive neurons were not observed after vehicle administration . in contrast, at  <dig> hours after da administration, a few tunel-positive neurons were observed . furthermore, at  <dig> days after da administration, many tunel-positive neurons were observed . administration of  <dig> mg/kg da significantly increased the percentage of tunel positive cells at  <dig> hours  and  <dig> days  compared with that of vehicle . expression of wdr <dig> mrna in the ca <dig> region was not detected by in situ hybridization after administration of vehicle , whereas it was observed in the soma of neurons after administration of da . furthermore, immunohistochemical staining for wdr <dig> showed weak expression of wdr <dig> in the soma and axons of neurons  after administration of vehicle  and strong expression of wdr <dig> in the soma and axons of neurons  after administration of da . these results indicated that da induces the expression of wdr <dig> mrna and protein in neurons in the ca <dig> region of the hippocampus.


quantitative examination of wdr <dig> expression in rat hippocampus following da administration
subsequently, real-time rt-pcr and western blotting analyses were performed to quantitatively examine the increase in wdr <dig> expression in the hippocampus following intraperitoneal da administration. as shown in figure 3a, administration of  <dig> mg/kg da significantly increased wdr <dig> mrna expression to a level  <dig> -fold higher than the level observed after administration of vehicle. furthermore, as shown in figure 3b, administration of da at  <dig>  and  <dig> mg/kg significantly increased the expression of wdr <dig> protein compared with administration of vehicle. as the maximal effect was reached at  <dig> mg/kg da, a dose of  <dig> mg/kg of da was used for the following experiments.


as shown in figure 3c, da administration significantly increased the expression of wdr <dig> mrna at  <dig> hours, when the level was  <dig> -fold increased above the level at hour  <dig>  furthermore, as shown in figure 3d, da administration significantly increased the expression of wdr <dig> protein from  <dig> to  <dig> hours, with the maximal effect compared with hour  <dig> reached at  <dig> hours. these results showed that da dose-dependently and time-dependently increases wdr <dig> expression in the rat hippocampus.

examination of the relationships between ampa/ka receptors, ros and wdr35
intraperitoneal injections of the selective glutamate receptor antagonists nbqx  and mk- <dig>  were used to determine the types of glutamate receptors involved in the upregulation of wdr <dig> expression in the rat hippocampus at  <dig> hours after intraperitoneal da administration . analysis of immunoblots showed that nbqx significantly attenuated the da-induced increase in wdr <dig> protein expression . in contrast, mk- <dig> did not alter the da-induced increase in wdr <dig> protein expression . the antagonists alone had no effect on wdr <dig> protein expression.


several reports have shown that da induces ros generation in vitro via activation of the ampa/ka receptor  <cit> . therefore, we examined whether ros might play a role in the da-induced increase in wdr <dig> protein expression in the rat hippocampus by using the radical scavenger edaravone  that has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in animal models of several brain disorders  <cit> . analysis of immunoblots showed that pretreatment with edaravone significantly attenuated the da-induced upregulation of wdr <dig> .

examination of the relationships between ampa/ka receptors, ros and p <dig> mapk
as harper et al.  <cit>  reported that ros activates the p <dig> mapk pathway, we then investigated whether intraperitoneal da administration increases p <dig> mapk phosphorylation in the rat hippocampus. treatment with da significantly increased p <dig> mapk phosphorylation in immunoblots of hippocampal tissue samples . we also examined the effect of nbqx and edaravone on the da-induced increase in p <dig> mapk phosphorylation in the rat hippocampus. nbqx and edaravone significantly attenuated da-induced p <dig> mapk phosphorylation in immunoblots of hippocampal tissue samples . no significant change in the expression of p <dig> mapk protein was observed. these results suggested that activation of the ampa/ka receptor resulting in ros generation followed by p <dig> mapk phosphorylation might be involved in the da-induced upregulation of wdr <dig> 


discussion
lc-ms/ms has emerged as a powerful technique for the identification and quantification of natural products, such as toxins, in complicated matrices. in the present study, we applied this technique to the analysis of da in the rat brain following an intraperitoneal dose of  <dig> mg/kg da and confirmed the presence of da  at a mean concentration of  <dig>  ng/g tissue. a recent study using lc-ms/ms reported that the concentration of da in fetal rat brains following an intravenous dose of  <dig> mg/kg da in pregnant rats was stable at a mean of  <dig>  ng/g tissue  <cit> . although the experimental conditions differed greatly between this study and ours, the concentration of da achieved in the brains of rats appeared to be comparable.

in the present study, neuronal shrinkage and cell dropout were observed in the ca <dig> region of the rat hippocampus at  <dig> hours after da administration . similar neurodegenerative changes were also observed in rat brain in previous reports, although the doses of da, route of administration of da, and time course of measured effects were different in these studies:  <dig> mg/kg i.p. at 6– <dig> hours  <cit> ,  <dig>  mg/kg i.p. at  <dig> days  <cit> , and  <dig>  mg/kg i.v. at 5– <dig> days  <cit> . as reported previously  <cit> , tunel-positive cells were observed following da administration . these observations suggest that in the present study, intraperitoneally administered da induced neurodegenerative changes including apoptosis in the hippocampus.

previously, we reported that enhanced wdr <dig> expression may mediate apoptosis in several animal models  <cit> . as expected, expression of wdr <dig> was observed in neurons in the ca <dig> region of the rat hippocampus following da administration . quantitative examination of wdr <dig> expression showed that wdr <dig> is upregulated in the rat hippocampus following da administration. the increases in wdr <dig> mrna and protein expression in the hippocampus were both dose-dependent  and time-dependent , suggesting that the increased expression of wdr <dig> may participate in the da-induced neurodegenerative changes that were observed.

in studies in vitro, the toxicity of da is mediated mainly via activation of the ampa/ka receptor  <cit> , whereas neurotoxicity is mediated secondarily via da activation of the nmda receptor/ca2+ pathway  <cit> . we examined the role of glutamate receptors in the da-induced increase in wdr <dig> expression by using pharmacological blocking agents. we demonstrated that an ampa/ka receptor antagonist  significantly attenuated the da-induced increase in wdr <dig> protein expression in vivo , but an nmda receptor antagonist  did not . these results suggest that the ampa/ka receptor could play a role in da-induced increases in wdr <dig> expression in vivo.

the induction of neuronal cell death by da is mediated by increased ros production  <cit> . in addition, kainic acid has been reported to stimulate ros generation  <cit> . these observations led us to investigate the relationship between ros and wdr <dig> expression by using a radical scavenger, edaravone. we demonstrated that edaravone significantly attenuated da-induced wdr <dig> expression , suggesting that da-induced ros production may increase the expression of wdr <dig> in vivo. in some studies, ros have been shown to activate p <dig> mapk, eventually causing apoptosis  <cit> . in the present study, we demonstrated that da significantly increased p <dig> mapk phosphorylation in vivo, and this effect was significantly attenuated by nbqx and edaravone . very recently, we found that the local anesthetic bupivacaine increases intracellular ros levels and activates p <dig> mapk, resulting in apoptosis via an increase in wdr <dig> expression in mouse neuroblastoma neuro2a cells . taking these observations into account, we speculate that in the present study, the increase in ros production and activation of p <dig> mapk by da resulted in increased expression of wdr <dig> in the rat hippocampus.

although several studies demonstrated that da induces excitotoxic neuronal damage via activation of glutamate receptors  <cit> , the mechanistic cascades have not been investigated in vivo. in the present study, we provided the first evidence of the sequence of mechanisms for da-induced toxicity by histological and biochemical examinations in vivo, in which da activated the ampa/ka receptor, and induced ros production and p <dig> mapk phosphorylation, resulting in an increase in the expression of wdr <dig>  our findings will be useful for future studies such as possible involvement of transcription factors of activating protein- <dig>  and nuclear factor-kappa b  families in da-induced toxicity, and detailed sequence of events including the role of wdr <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results indicated that da activated the ampa/ka receptor, and induced ros production and p <dig> mapk phosphorylation, resulting in an increase in the expression of wdr <dig>
