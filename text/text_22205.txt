BACKGROUND
cpg islands  are unmethylated segments of a genome that have an increased level of cpg dinucleotides and a high gc content  <cit> . in the human genome, most cgis are either inside or close to the promoter regions of genes <cit> . typically these cgis occur at or close to transcription start sites 
 <cit> . it is well established that cpg sites in promoter cgis are undermethylated in expressed genes, while hypermethylation of promoter cpg sites is associated with gene silencing
 <cit> . others cgis that are distant from known tsss have been found in intergenic, 3’ and intragenic regions
 <cit> .

there is an extensive literature demonstrating that structural modifications to chromatin, along with cgi methylation, contribute to the functional output of related genes
 <cit> . the n-terminal tails of histone proteins can be modified covalently by small molecules  and by macromolecules . the precise environment of the cgi chromatin that controls gene regulation is not definitively established. the general understanding is that by altering the state of the cgi chromatin, histone modification can regulate access of the transcription machinery to particular dna sequences
 <cit> . of all the possible histone modifications, methylation of the lysine or arginine residues has received the main attention. these modifications can activate or repress the associated genes depending on which lysine or arginine residues are methylated
 <cit> . methylation of histone h <dig> at lysine  <dig>  or lysine  <dig>  is considered to be a repressive mark
 <cit> . in contrast, h3k4me <dig>  perhaps the best established epigenetic marker, is robustly associated with activation of transcription
 <cit> . in mammals, the trimethylation of h3k <dig> can be catalyzed by different histone methyltransferases, such as mll <dig> or ash1l
 <cit> . the majority of h3k4me <dig> sites overlap with the 5’ ends of annotated human genes
 <cit>  and several studies have reported the inverse correlation between two epigenetic marks, dna methylation and h3k4me3
 <cit> . the h3k4me <dig> mark also plays a crucial role in mammalian development
 <cit> , and its alteration has been found to be associated with cancer and other diseases
 <cit> . in addition, both h3k27ac and h3k36me <dig>  which are known as a promoter mark
 <cit>  and a gene body mark
 <cit> , respectively, are associated with transcriptional activation
 <cit> .

alterations in gene regulation are thought to play an important role both in adaptation and evolution
 <cit> . a recent report proposed that differences in gene expression levels among primates are associated with the changes in h3k4me3
 <cit> . moreover, another recent study identified human-specific changes in h3k4me <dig> levels at tsss and related regulatory sequences in comparison with chimpanzees and macaques
 <cit> . besides, the encyclopedia of dna elements  project is studying different functional elements of human genome including regions of histone modifications. in particular they assayed chromosomal locations for  <dig> histone modification in  <dig> different cell types
 <cit> . in a previous study
 <cit> , we demonstrated that cgis under selective pressure are hypomethylated compared to the cgis in other regions of the genome. in this study, we explored the relationship between selective pressure signatures of and histone modification  enrichment in cgis. we used the genome-wide histone modification data of thirteen human cell lines produced by the encode consortium
 <cit> . to define regions under selective pressure we used three distinct methods
 <cit>  that are able to detect both recent and ancient selective pressure events
 <cit> .

RESULTS
we analyzed thirteen cell lines from the encode/broad institute, derived from nine normal and four cancer tissues, respectively. a list of features for each considered cell line is presented in additional file
1: table s <dig>  for each cell line, we downloaded histone modification data for h3k4me <dig>  h3k27ac and h3k36me <dig> marks.

we used the “peaks signal” , representing regions of statically significant enrichment of a specific histone modification . we downloaded genomic coordinates of  <dig> unique cgis defined according to criteria described in the university of california santa cruz genome browser   . for each cell line, we estimated the number of cgis containing at least one ps of histone modification and found, on average,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cgis containing pss of h3k4me <dig>  h3k27ac and h3k36me <dig>  respectively.

to identify genomic regions that may have undergone selective pressure we used three different approaches that are sensitive to selective pressure events that occurred in distinct evolutionary epochs.

the first method uses the per-continent “integrated haplotype score” 
 <cit>  and marks recent positive selection . using the ihs we identified  <dig> genomic regions that have putatively undergone recent selective pressure. we denoted these regions as “high ihs regions” . within the hirs regions we found  <dig> cgis.

the second approach is based on a comparison between homo sapiens and neanderthal genomes . the selective sweep scan score  was used to identify regions of the human genome with a strong signal for depletion of neanderthal-derived alleles. this score, when negative, may indicate an episode of positive selection in early humans
 <cit> . we found  <dig> genomic regions with a significant negative score  containing  <dig> cgis.

in the third approach, we looked for sequences that were conserved across ten primate genomes. these sequences are the so-called “conserved elements”   and they mark ancient selective pressure events. we downloaded  <dig> ces and used them to search for cgis that contain ces
 <cit> . we identified  <dig> unique cgis that contained at least one ce.

we, then, computed the fraction of cgis containing histone modification marks that show signatures of natural selection , and compared it with an analogous quantity computed for cgis shown to have no signals of selective pressure. the presence of a possible enrichment/diminishment, defined as the ratio of the percentages of the above two groups, was assessed by means of a hypergeometric test .

overall analysis
we found a significant enrichment of h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac markers for all three signatures of selection in almost all cell lines  while for h3k36me <dig> the enrichment reached significance only for the ce signature .
 <dig> 
 <dig> 

in order to understand if the results are due to the same cgis identified by the three different methods, we estimated the overlaps among the corresponding cgis lists . as shown in the figure, the different sets of cgis identified are not essentially included one in the other.

position analysis
we investigated whether or not these differences were dependent on the position of the cgis in various genomic regions. to do this we followed the same approach described by medvedeva et al.
 <cit>  dividing the cgis into four groups according to their positions with respect to genes: at the 5’ end of a gene, in the intragenic region, at the 3’ end of a gene, and in the intergenic region. results of this analysis are presented as additional information  and summarized below.

analysis of 5’ cgis demonstrated the same significant enrichment pattern as seen in the overall analysis with significant enrichment of h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac , in almost all cell lines for all signatures of selection, and significant enrichment of h3k36me <dig> in all cell lines for the ce signature only .

both intragenic and 3’ cgis were significantly enriched for h3k36me <dig> in the majority of cells lines  for the ce signature , while analysis of the other markers did not reach significance in almost all other cases .

finally, regarding intergenic cgis we found a significant enrichment in all cell lines for all considered markers for the ce signature and in twelve out of thirteen cell lines for h3k4me <dig> in the hir signature .

evolutionary forces analysis
two major evolutionary forces result in enriched cpg content: one is based on low levels of dna methylation and, consequentially, deamination; and the other is biased gene conversion , which acts to repair tg mismatches caused by the deamination of methyl-cytosine
 <cit> . according to the role that these two forces play in cgi maintenance, cgis can be classified as hypo-deaminated cgis or bgc cgis. we examined whether or not the relationship that we found between selective pressure and histone mark enrichment was present in both classes.

we found that both hypo-deaminated and bcg cgis showed an enrichment of all markers in the ce signature in all cell lines, while only bgg cgis showed significant enrichment of h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac in the hir signature in all cell lines .

expression divergence between humans and chimps and histone modifications
cain et al.
 <cit>  have identified genes whose expression levels differ between species. in particular, by using their approach we have classified  <dig> genes as differentially expressed  between humans and chimpanzees, at a fdr of  <dig>   among the whole set of  <dig> genes considered in their study
 <cit> . inside this class, and by applying a great analysis
 <cit>  we associated corresponding sets of genes to ce cgis , hir cgis  and 5slr cgis  . as shown in additional file
24: table s <dig>  the ce cgi genes are significantly enriched for de, while hir cgi genes, even if they do not match our conservative threshold for statistical significance of  <dig> , show a p-value =  <dig> . no significant signal is present in 5slr cgi genes. in the additional file
25: table s <dig> we presented the histone modification enrichments referred to the different classes of genes labeled by their selective signal , and by their possible membership to the class of de. as clear from the table, we found a significant enrichment of histone modifications in de + ce genes, with respect to de – ce class , and this is independent of the histone modification chosen. the same is not true when we compare the enrichment in de + ce genes, with respect to ce – de. this suggests that ce plays the central role for the enrichment. the same is true for hir if we only consider h3k4me <dig>  whereas we get at most a marginal statistical significance if we take h3k27ac and h3k36me <dig>  no significance at all is found for 5slr.

as discussed in materials and methods, we assumed the conservative approach to define as ps genes the ones associated to the list of ps cgis that were simultaneously present in all cell lines. in order to understand if our results depend on such choice we have also considered the other extreme case, namely labeling as ps genes the ones associated to a ps cgis in at least one cell line. this approach confirms the previous finding .

discussion
in this study, we investigated the hypothesis that cgis under selective pressure are enriched with histone modifications that are associated with gene activation. to do this, we analyzed data from thirteen human cell lines for three well-known histone modifications  to explore their relationship with both recent and ancient events of selective pressure.

h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac are epigenetic marks that are generally associated with gene activation
 <cit>  while h3k36me <dig> is associated with transcriptional elongation
 <cit> . moreover, h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac are evolutionarily conserved among species
 <cit>  and negatively correlated with dna methylation
 <cit> . also h3k36me <dig> in exons is found to be conserved between human and mouse
 <cit> .

using the entire set of human cgis we found that the cgis associated with signatures of selective pressure were significantly enriched with h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac in almost all considered cell lines. h3k36me <dig>  on the other hand, showed a significant enrichment in global cgis only in ce regions: this could be due to a small sample size effect . these findings support a previous study in which we found that cgis located in regions under selective pressure are more protected from dna methylation compared the cgis in other genomic regions
 <cit> . in the same study, we found that cgis under selective pressure show a lower snp content as well. here we checked two parameters more: c+g content and cgis’ length, and we found that ce cgis have a slight but statistically higher g+c content compared with the remaining cgis , and  an enrichment of long  cgis . we did not find significant differences in length and g+c content for hir and 5lsr cgis.

when we divided cgis according to their positions with respect to the genes, we found that the statistical differences between cgis with and without signatures of selective pressure were clearest for cgis located in the 5’ regions for both h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac. this result is intriguing in the light of the well established evidence that cgis at the 5’ ends of genes are involved mainly in the control of gene expression
 <cit> . it is also possible that the small sample size led to a lack of statistical confidence in the results for cgis in other positions. we noticed a different behavior for h3k36me <dig>  h3k36me <dig> was the only mark to be enriched in 3’ and intragenic cgis in ce regions for majority of cell lines; this finding is again intriguing considering that h3k36me <dig> is reported to be a gene body mark
 <cit> . in a recent study, h3k36me <dig> mark was found to be significantly associated with alternative splicing
 <cit> . it is well known that, alternative splicing is a key reason for protein diversity in higher eukaryotes
 <cit> . it has been a fundamental question in evolutionary study, how species having the similar repertoires of protein-coding genes differ strikingly at the phenotypic level. a very recent study proposed a link between alternative splicing and species-specific phenotypic differences among vertebrate species
 <cit> .

two different evolutionary processes, namely hypo-deamination and bcg, are involved in the generation and maintenance of cgis
 <cit> . the majority of hypo-deaminated cgis are usually unmethylated while most bgc cgis are constitutively methylated and clustered in subtelomeric regions. we found h3k4me <dig>  h3k27ac and h3k36me <dig> enrichment in cgis in ce regions, independently of the evolutionary process involved in their generation. since cgis belonging to these two groups differ in their dna methylation levels, our finding seems to suggest that the difference we found was quite independent of the dna methylation status.

the impact of natural selection on functional elements in human genome is also addressed in the last report from encode project
 <cit> . in that case the authors focused their attention mainly on the relationship between negative selection and a subset of functional elements but they did not specifically address histone modifications. positive selection, on the other hand, was addressed in a recent work by vernot et al.
 <cit>  who studied the impact of this kind of selective pressure on dnase i peaks.

cain et al
 <cit>  identified a list of genes that were differentially expressed between humans and other primates. they proposed that epigenetic changes could be, at least in part, involved in these differences. when we compared this list with the list of genes associated to the cgis, we found a significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes in the ce cgi genes list, while the hir cgi genes showed a p-value  near our conservative threshold for statistical significance . this seems to suggest that genes transcriptionally different between species are more likely located near cgis with signature of selective pressure. in literature it is growing the evidence that epigenetic mechanisms provide a significant source of phenotypic variation that, in turn, can cause evolutionary novelty and potentially influence adaptation and evolution. although the exact evolutionary significance of our results need further experiments to be completely defined, our data seem to support the idea of a close connection between adaptation, evolution and epigenetic mechanisms.

it has been hypothesized that cgis are fundamental regulatory structures that have evolved under selection in genomes where dna methylation plays a regulatory role
 <cit> . in particular, cgis act as a platform where chromatin modifications and additional signaling help to define the functional output of the respective genes.

the present analysis concerning h3k4me <dig>  h3k27ac and h3k36me <dig> enrichment in cgis under selective pressure, supplements the findings of a previous paper by cocozza et al.
 <cit> . in that study, we demonstrated a dna undermethylation of cgis under selective pressure. it is well established that a complex, perhaps bidirectional, crosstalk exists between dna methylation and histone modification
 <cit>  suggesting that these two epigenetic mechanisms are, at some extent, dependent one each other. the overall picture emerging from the two studies is that cgis under selective pressure seem to share definite epigenetic features.

to our knowledge, the present study is the first report addressing the relationship between histone modifications and natural selection and the overall framework emerging from our analyses support the hypothesis that cgis that have experienced selection could be characterized by distinct epigenetic signatures.

CONCLUSIONS
analyzing thirteen human cell lines, we found h3k4me <dig>  h3k27ac and h3k36me <dig> enrichment in the cgis that experienced selective events. further studies using other epigenetic marks could help to clarify the relation between epigenetic modification and selective pressure in human genome.
