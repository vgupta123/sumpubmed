BACKGROUND
endosymbiosis has been a driving force in the evolution of eukaryotic cells. all known eukaryotes possess mitochondria , which evolved from an ancestor of modern-day alpha-proteobacteria 
 <cit> . plastids, the light-gathering organelles of plants and algae, have evolved in several different ways 
 <cit> . the plastids of green, red and glaucophyte algae are believed to have evolved from a single “primary” endosymbiotic event that occurred between a eukaryotic host and a cyanobacterial endosymbiont. subsequently, the primary plastids of red and green algae spread to other eukaryotic lineages by “secondary” endosymbiosis, e.g., in the haptophytes, stramenopiles and euglenophytes. genome size reduction is a commonly seen phenomenon in endosymbiosis. plastid and mitochondrial genomes are typically <5% of the size of the bacterial genomes from which they are believed to have evolved 
 <cit>  and in the case of secondary endosymbiosis the nucleus of the eukaryotic endosymbiont is usually lost entirely 
 <cit> . this massive genome reduction is due to the combined effects of endosymbiotic gene transfer  and the outright loss of genes presumed to be unnecessary for an endosymbiotic lifestyle 
. more than  <dig>  organelle-targeted proteins, encoded by the host nucleus, are necessary for the proper functioning of modern-day plastids and mitochondria 
 <cit> .

nucleomorphs are residual secondary endosymbiont nuclei found in two different eukaryotic algal lineages, the chlorarachniophytes and cryptophytes 
 <cit> . these unusual organelles exist between the second and third envelope membranes of their plastids. this space is known as the periplastidial compartment , which corresponds to the cytosol of the engulfed eukaryotic endosymbiont. molecular phylogenetic analyses have shown that the nucleomorph and plastid of chlorarachniophytes are derived from endosymbiotic green algae, whereas red algae gave rise to the nucleomorph and plastid in cryptophytes 
. nucleomorph genomes are highly reduced: at present the observed size range is between  <dig>  and  <dig> megabase pairs  
. despite their independent origins, the nucleomorph genomes of both cryptophytes and chlorarachniophytes exhibit common structural features such as the presence of three linear chromosomes and sub-telomeric ribosomal rna  operons 
 <cit> . these similarities suggest that both endosymbiont genomes have been subjected to similar reductive pressures during the process of secondary endosymbiosis.

nucleomorph genomes have been completely sequenced in one chlorarachniophyte, bigellowiela natans <cit> , and four cryptophytes, guillardia theta <cit> , hemiselmis andersenii <cit> , cryptomonas paramecium <cit>  and chroomonas mesostigmatica <cit> . the number of protein genes encoded by the nucleomorph genomes examined thus far is between  <dig> and  <dig> and gene density is high, in some cases approximately one gene per kbp. protein sequence lengths and intergenic spacer regions are also reduced compared to those of free-living algae 
. as in mitochondria, plastids, and some endosymbionts and parasites, nucleomorph genomes exhibit a highly biased a + t content  
. most of the proteins encoded by nucleomorph genomes are predicted to be involved in housekeeping functions such as translation and transcription 
. only a small number of genes for plastid-associated proteins are present . tanifuji et al. <cit>  found that the sequenced nucleomorph genomes of cryptophytes and chlorarachniophytes share a similar set of core proteins, suggesting convergent patterns of gene retention in these independently reduced genomes. overall, chlorarachniophyte and cryptophyte nucleomorph genomes are similar in terms of size, structure and gene content, despite having evolved from different algal endosymbionts.

perhaps the most striking difference between chlorarachniophyte and cryptophyte nucleomorph genomes is the number of spliceosomal introns. while chlorarachniophyte nucleomorph genomes are intron-rich , few or no introns are found in cryptophyte nucleomorph genomes 
. nucleomorph introns in the chlorarachniophytes b. natans and gymnochlora stellata are tiny  compared to those in green algae 
 <cit> . in the green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii and ostreococcus tauri, for example, mean intron lengths are  <dig> and 103 bp, respectively 
 <cit> . comparison of intron positions in the b. natans nucleomorph genome to green algae  and plants suggest that the nucleomorph introns were acquired from the green algal nucleus that gave rise to the nucleomorph 
 <cit> . the radical intron size reduction in chlorarachniophyte nucleomorph genomes appears to have taken place prior to the divergence of the modern-day species that have been examined 
 <cit> .

although knowledge of nucleomorph genome evolution is accumulating, progress is hampered by the existence of only a single chlorarachniophyte nucleomorph genome sequence. the true diversity of nucleomorph genome structure and coding capacity in chlorarachniophytes is at present unclear. in order to gain insight into the patterns and processes of reduction within and between chlorarachniophyte and cryptophyte nucleomorph genomes, additional sequences from chlorarachniophytes are necessary. plastid genome sequences are also important pieces of the puzzle. complete plastid genomes have been sequenced for three cryptophytes, g. theta <cit> , rhodomonas salina <cit>  and c. paramecium <cit> , but only a single chlorarachniophyte plastid genome sequence is presently available, that of b. natans <cit> .

here we present complete nucleomorph and plastid genome sequences for the chlorarachniophyte lotharella oceanica and compare them to their counterparts in the model chlorarachniophyte b. natans. the results suggest that recombination is an important factor driving the shrinkage and occasional expansion of nucleomorph genomes in chlorarachniophytes and perhaps cryptophytes. we have also carried out a phylogenetic analysis of nucleomorph and plastid proteins in order to gain insight into the origin of the chlorarachniophyte secondary endosymbiont.

RESULTS
lotharella oceanica nucleomorph and plastid genome sequences
the l. oceanica nucleomorph genome consists of three linear chromosomes totaling ~610 kbp, which is 240 kbp larger than b. natans, the first complete nucleomorph genome sequenced for a chlorarachniophyte . the l. oceanica chromosomes are ~ <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp in size. on chromosome i, an internally repeated region consisting of at least five tandem repeats containing clpc and tfiia-gamma genes and three additional orfs was identified  . because of this repeat, the exact size of chromosome i is unclear. however, our assembly-based chromosome size predictions are consistent with previous estimates of ~ <dig>  ~ <dig>  and ~195 kbp obtained by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis

the g + c content of the three l. oceanica nucleomorph chromosomes is  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % for i, ii, and iii, respectively. however, ~35 kbp sub-telomeric regions repeated on each of the six chromosome ends were found to be of much higher g + c content,  <dig> % . excluding the sub-telomeric regions, the g + c content is  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % for chromosomes i, ii, and iii, similar to that in the b. natans nucleomorph genome  as well as the four cryptophyte nucleomorph genomes sequenced to date  
.

the plastid genome of l. oceanica was found to be circular and  <dig>  bp in size, encoding  <dig> proteins  and  <dig> trnas, plus  <dig> rrnas in inverted repeats . the g + c content is  <dig> %. the genome is highly similar to the b. natans plastid genome in size, gene order, g + c content and structure, albeit with a few exceptions: 1) a psaa gene is missing from one of the two ends of the inverted repeats, and a petd gene is missing from the other end; 2) the position of petd and petb are switched; 3) a gene encoding a putative reverse transcriptase was found in l. oceanica between the chli and peta genes, implying the existence of a group ii intron in l. oceanica. however, an orf was not detectable in the vicinity of the reverse transcriptase-encoding region . the l. oceanica plastid genome contains three small inverted repeats. one consists of a 28 bp sequence located between the psbj and trna-phe genes, and two inverted repeat pairs consisting of 76 bp and 93 bp are located side by side between atpi and psbe. the region between the atpi and psbe genes could not be sequenced in b. natans, presumably due to extensive secondary structure. we were successful in determining the dna sequence of the corresponding region in the l. oceanica plastid genome. however, its sequence characteristics do not provide further insight into the possibility that it is an origin of replication site, as was suggested for b. natans <cit> . the unusual rrna operon inversion seen in b. natans, in which the small and large subunit rrna genes are on the opposite strand, is also present in the l. oceanica plastid genome.figure  <dig>

synteny, gene content and intron evolution in chlorarachniophyte nucleomorph genomes
the structure and coding capacity of the nucleomorph genomes in l. oceanica and b. natans are summarized in table 
 <dig> and additional file 
 <dig>   <dig> protein genes were predicted in the l. oceanica nucleomorph genome; this number is almost twice as many as in b. natans. however, this is mainly due to a total of  <dig> predicted orfs with no introns in the ~35 kbp sub-telomeric regions. in fact, the number of non-redundant protein genes  is  <dig>   <dig> more than in b. natans  . since the sub-telomeric region of each chromosome end shows extremely low levels of gene expression compared with internally located genes, it is unclear if the sub-telomeric orfs are real protein-coding genes . in addition, the total number of introns in both genomes is similar, with  <dig>  in l. oceanica and  <dig> in b. natans . there are  <dig> trna genes in both genomes, but with a few differences in their content compared to each other. bona fide snrnas were not found in the l. oceanica nucleomorph genome.

the average intergenic spacer size in the l. oceanica genome is  <dig>  bp, which is significantly higher than in b. natans   ). the average length of all predicted proteins in the l. oceanica genome  was found to be smaller than that in b. natans  . however, no significant difference  was seen in the average length of  <dig> shared proteins , with an average of  <dig>  amino acids in l. oceanica and  <dig>  in b. natans.

the l. oceanica nucleomorph chromosomes were found to contain a repetitive sequence consisting of a 36 nt repeat located between all of the ~ <dig> kbp sub-telomeric regions and the internal single-copy regions . repetitive sequences were found in the nucleomorph genome of the cryptophyte c. mesostigmatica <cit> , but in that case they consisted of a-t-rich simple repeats such as n located in the its between the 5s and 28s rdna, and  <dig> and 4– <dig> in intergenic spacers of the sub-telomeric repeats. a long homopolymer of 24– <dig> was also found in several sites within 28s rdna in c. mesostigmatica. in contrast, the repetitive sequences in l. oceanica were less a-t rich and less variable in sequence. intriguingly, each 36 nt repeat in l. oceanica has a potential initiation codon in the same reading frame as the gene for the molecular chaperone dnak, which is of cyanobacterial origin and presumed to be targeted to the plastid. however, the transit peptide prediction for the repetitive sequence, as well as the region immediately upstream of the predicted dnak start codon, did not identify a stretch of amino acids predicted to target the protein to the plastid. on the other hand, an additional dnak gene located internally on chromosome i, was predicted to encode a transit peptide using the chlorop 
 <cit>  and targetp 
 <cit>  programs.

genome synteny has been investigated previously in four completely sequenced cryptophyte nucleomorph genomes 
. in l. oceanica and b. natans we identified  <dig> short blocks of synteny  . in contrast, the plastid genomes in the two chlorarachniophytes showed almost the same gene order. a similar pattern is seen in cryptophytes. the plastid genomes of the photosynthetic species g. theta and r. salina are completely syntenic, and while the non-photosynthetic species c. paramecium contains one rearranged region around the ribosomal operon in its plastid genome, the overall level of synteny is still high 
. this suggests that recombination is much more frequent in the nucleomorph genomes of both cryptophytes and chlorarachniophytes than in the plastid genomes . in sum, the nucleomorph genomes of b. natans and l. oceanica differ remarkably in terms of the number of predicted proteins, structure and synteny, while their plastid genomes have changed little since the two organisms diverged from a common ancestor.

sub-telomeric repeats and secondary expansion of the l. oceanica nucleomorph genome
the most unexpected finding in the l. oceanica nucleomorph genome was the presence of large, nearly identical  ~35 kbp sub-telomeric repeats on each of the six chromosome ends . as mentioned above, these repeats have a g + c content  that is much higher than the internal regions of the chromosomes, which are ~25% g + c . lane et al. <cit>  reported a ‘high’ g + c content in the short sub-telomeric region  between the rdna operon and the nearby ubc <dig> gene in the cryptophyte nucleomorph genomes of g. theta, hanusia phi and proteomonas sulcata. regions of ~50% g + c, including the rdna operons themselves, also exist on at least four of the six chromosome ends in completely sequenced cryptophyte nucleomorph genomes 
 <cit> . however, in these species the repeats are relatively short with lengths ranging from 7–12 kbp .figure  <dig>

nucleomorph genome. gray boxes indicate gene expression levels corresponding to rna-seq coverage depth of each gene. red lines show the g + c levels on the chromosomes, which were captured from artemis genome annotation software with the default setting. the black boxes under the graph indicate multicopy regions.



also remarkable are the protein genes located within the nucleomorph sub-telomeric repeats of l. oceanica. of the  <dig> protein genes predicted in this region, only two show obvious sequence similarity to known proteins  . interestingly, transcriptome analyses of l. oceanica showed that the level of transcription of these  <dig> unknown genes in sub-telomeric repeats was extremely low , almost  <dig>  times lower than the average expression level for the protein genes in single-copy regions of the chromosomes . it is therefore possible that the  <dig> orfs lacking obvious functions in the l. oceanica sub-telomeric regions are in fact not real protein genes. a recent comprehensive analysis of nucleomorph gene expression in g. theta, c. mesostigmatica, c. paramecium and b. natans showed that as a whole, nucleomorphs exhibit high transcription levels, with >97% of these four nucleomorph genomes being transcribed into mrna, including non-coding regions 
 <cit> . therefore, the extremely low transcription levels of the orfs residing within the ~35 kb sub-telomeric regions of the l. oceanica genome is unusual, and consistent with them being spurious orfs. the completely sequenced nucleomorph genomes of g. theta, c. mesostigmatica, c. paramecium and b. natans also contain sub-telomeric repeats, but they are much shorter than those in l. oceanica, and we were unable to obtain a clear picture of the extent to which they are expressed.

what is the biological significance of the long sub-telomeric repeat regions in l. oceanica? gene conversion via genetic recombination is the most likely explanation for the maintenance of the near-identical rdna sequences at the nucleomorph chromosome ends and such a process presumably acts to homogenize the adjacent sub-telomeric region as well. it seems significant that there are short repetitive sequences located next to the ~35 kbp sub-telomeric regions in l. oceanica, which show variable numbers of sequence units  . these heterogeneous repetitive sequences might be mediators of genetic recombination within and between nucleomorph chromosomes. also, the elevated g + c content of the sub-telomeric regions in the l. oceanica nucleomorph genome is consistent with the phenomenon of gc-biased gene conversion, which has been demonstrated in other genomes such as those of mammals 
 <cit> .

investigation of the hsp <dig> gene in l. oceanica provided insight into nucleomorph genome dynamics. no fewer than  <dig> copies of hsp <dig> were found in the genome: an ‘internal’ gene on chromosome i, another on chromosome ii, six copies within the sub-telomeric repeats and two pseudogenes on chromosomes i and iii . the sub-telomeric hsp <dig> genes have a g + c content of  <dig> %, higher than the other isoforms . homologous recombination events have presumably occurred at the nucleomorph chromosome ends, resulting in hsp <dig> genes whose sequences are homogenized by gene conversion. the g + c content of the hsp <dig> genes located internally on chromosomes i and ii are still higher than the average g + c content . this is the case for other internally located multicopy regions as well . these observations suggest that gene conversion may be homogenizing multicopy genes throughout the l. oceanica nucleomorph genome, not just those residing in sub-telomeric regions. such a process could result in the loss of some or all of the sub-telomeric repeat regions; homologous regions could disappear by unequal crossing over between sister chromatids. in cryptophytes, evidence for active recombination in nucleomorph genomes has come from investigations of c. paramecium and h. anderseniii, where complete rdna operons have been lost from two and three of the six chromosome ends, respectively  
 <cit> .

in order to gain further insight into the dynamic nature of nucleomorph chromosomes in l. oceanica, we examined the evolution of hsp <dig>  a multi-copy gene present at least once on all three chromosomes and whose protein product is amenable to phylogenetic analysis. the three main types of hsp <dig> genes/proteins in l. oceanica were found to be monophyletic in phylogenetic trees and to branch sister to the b. natans nucleomorph hsp <dig>  which is not sub-telomeric in its location . this result is consistent with the idea that gene duplication occurred sometime after l. oceanica and b. natans diverged from one another. alternatively, b. natans may have possessed multiple hsp <dig> genes in its nucleomorph genome in the past, as does l. oceanica today, but lost them, perhaps due to recombination. on balance, however, it seems likely that while nucleomorph genomes are highly reduced, active recombination at the sub-telomeric repeats can serve to expand the genome over evolutionary time.

previous nucleomorph comparative genomic investigations revealed the existence of numerous blocks of synteny  among the cryptophyte genomes of g. theta, h. andersenii and c. paramecium, some of which are in the range of ~25-45 kbp. however, the genome of the cryptophyte c. mesostigmatica was found to be much more fragmented compared to the other three, despite the fact that c. mesostigmatica and h. andersenii are specifically related to one another 
 <cit> . moore et al. 
 <cit>  showed that in c. mesostigmatica, the average number of genes in each syntenic block compared to g. theta, h. andersenii and c. paramecium is  <dig> - <dig> , whereas it is  <dig> - <dig>  when these three cryptophyte species are compared to one another. compared to their plastid genomes, which show an extremely high level of gene synteny, the nucleomorph genomes of l. oceanica and b. natans are highly scrambled. we identified  <dig> nucleomorph syntenic blocks  and the average number of genes in these regions was found to be  <dig> , even smaller than the level of synteny seen between c. mesostigmatica and the other three cryptophytes nucleomorph genomes. lane et al. 
 <cit>  suggested that the high level of synteny in cryptophyte nucleomorph genomes is due to relatively low rates of recombination in internal regions. why might the nucleomorph genomes of l. oceanica and c. mesostigmatica possess somewhat smaller blocks of synteny compared to the other nucleomorph genomes? although unrelated to one another, these two nucleomorph genomes are similar in their possession of multicopy regions, repetitive sequence elements and somewhat larger genome sizes. therefore, it is possible that in addition to homologous recombination at the sub-telomeric regions, homologous and non-homologous recombination in internal portions of the chromosomes have occurred along the entire lengths of the chromosomes in l. oceanica and c. mesostigmatica. the significantly larger mean intergenic spacer size in l. oceanica  compared to b. natans  also supports the idea of more frequent internal recombination; in regions where gene density is lower, recombination events would be less likely to disrupt essential genes. compared to other cryptophytes, the c. mesostigmatica nucleomorph genome shows a somewhat larger average intergenic spacer size as well 
 <cit> . a more detailed picture of the impact of recombination on genome structure in chlorarachniophyte nucleomorphs will require genomic data from additional strains and species; with only two sequences in hand, it is unclear which of the two genomes—that of l. oceanica or b. natans—is more recombinagenic.

convergent nucleomorph genome evolution in cryptophytes and chlorarachniophytes
the l. oceanica nucleomorph genome contains  <dig> predicted protein genes. of the  <dig> non-redundant protein genes,  <dig> were categorized as proteins with predicted functions shared with other eukaryotes under previously proposed criteria 
 <cit> .  <dig> of  <dig> non-redundant protein genes had homologs in cyanobacteria and were designated ‘plastid-associated’.  <dig> protein genes were considered to be ‘nucleomorph orfans’ , that is, nucleomorph proteins with unknown functions . however,  <dig> of these norfans reside within the sub-telomeric repeats , and thus account for 25% of the non-redundant norfan genes. these genes were removed from our comparative genomic investigations.

compared to the non-redundant gene set in the b. natans nucleomorph genome, l. oceanica retains similar sets of eukaryotic conserved genes  .  <dig> of these genes  are missing in l. oceanica but are present in the b. natans nucleomorph genome, and vice versa for nine l. oceanica genes  . despite missing several protein genes, the absence of whole suites of proteins predicted to function together in complexes was not observed in l. oceanica.figure  <dig> 
comparison of nucleomorph gene content within and between chlorarachniophyte and cryptophyte algae. the venn diagrams show the number of shared and / or unique genes in three categories: eukaryotic conserved , nucleomorph orfans , and plastid-associated genes in the two chlorarachniophyte nucleomorph genomes , and core nucleomorph genes  in chlorarachniophytes and cryptophytes .



in stark contrast to the eukaryotic conserved genes with predicted functions, only  <dig> - <dig> % of norfans were obviously shared between l. oceanica  and b. natans  . interestingly, a similar tendency was observed when considering nucleomorph gene sets among three cryptophytes 
 <cit> . in this case,  <dig> - <dig> % of eukaryotic conserved orfs  were shared with one another in g. theta, h. andersenii and c. paramecium, and only  <dig> - <dig> % for norfans . the norfans of chlorarachniophytes and cryptophytes have been proposed to represent particularly fast-evolving genes whose sequences have diverged to the point where their homologs in related nucleomorph genomes  can no longer be detected 
. additionally, the l. oceanica and b. natans genomes encode the exact same set of  <dig> plastid-associated proteins. this parallels the cryptophyte genomes sequenced thus far , which share a set of  <dig> plastid-associated protein genes 
.

the convergent evolution of nucleomorph genomes in cryptophytes and chlorarachniophytes is apparent from the perspective of g + c content, chromosome structure , and the presence of three linear chromosomes. tanifuji et al. <cit>  extended this to the level of gene content, demonstrating that the majority of conserved eukaryotic genes  in the b. natans nucleomorph genome were contained in the core set of cryptophyte nucleomorph genes, i.e., genes shared by all three photosynthetic cryptophytes . this observation is bolstered by the present study. a ‘core’ set of  <dig> chlorarachniophyte nucleomorph genes was identified by comparison of the l. oceanica and b. natans gene sets .  <dig> of these  <dig> genes  were shared with at least one of the cryptophytes  . there is now strong support for the idea that these two independently evolved nucleomorph genomes have undergone similar reductive pressures and converged upon similar gene sets.

the availability of a complete nuclear genome sequence for b. natans has allowed us to explore the fate of the nine ‘missing’ conserved eukaryotic genes in this organism . curtis et al. <cit>  predicted  <dig>  and  <dig>  nucleus-encoded, periplastidal compartment -targeted proteins in b. natans and the cryptophyte g. theta, respectively. interestingly, in g. theta  <dig> of  <dig> genes missing from the nucleomorph genome but present in other cryptophyte nucleomorphs appear to have been lost without being replaced by a nucleus-encoded, ppc-targeted homolog  was potentially replaced by a host derived, ppc-targeted protein). as in cryptophytes, we were unable to identify obvious orthologs of the  <dig> genes missing from the b. natans nucleomorph genome that are present in the l. oceanica nucleomorph genome by searching the b. natans nuclear genome. obvious replacements for the  <dig> protein genes missing from the l. oceanica nucleomorph genome were also not found in transcriptome data from this organism . that is, the genes do not appear to have undergone nucleomorph-to-host-nucleus gene transfer. one explanation is that the functions of these missing proteins have been taken over by functionally ambiguous norfan proteins and/or nucleus-encoded, ppc-targeted hypothetical proteins. determining whether this is the case will require much more comparative sequence data and a better understanding of the biochemical processes taking place in the ppc.

several other factors also contribute to the larger nucleomorph genome size in l. oceanica. unlike the b. natans genome where only an rps <dig> gene and sub-telomeric regions are multicopy, there are many multicopy regions in the l. oceanica nucleomorph genome. in addition to the sub-telomeric regions and tandem repeats containing the clpc and tfiia-gamma genes on chromosome i, this includes  <dig> internally duplicated regions  that result in numerous multicopy genes  and gsp <dig> ). these genes contribute to the increase in the number of total protein genes in the l. oceanica genome , resulting in  <dig> more genes than in b. natans . another contributing factor is a slightly larger average intergenic spacer size in l. oceanica relative to b. natans . this mirrors the situation seen in the ‘large’ nucleomorph genome of the cryptophyte c. mesostigmatica. all things considered, a similar set of structural differences can explain the observed variation in nucleomorph genome size from species to species in both chlorarachniophytes and cryptophytes, despite their independent origins.

origins and evolution of chlorarachniophyte nucleomorph introns
a striking difference between chlorarachniophyte and cryptophyte nucleomorph genomes is the number of spliceosomal introns. gilson et al. <cit>  found  <dig> pigmy introns from the b. natans nucleomorph genome, whereas cryptophyte nucleomorph genomes contain only 0– <dig> spliceosomal introns 
. in this study we identified  <dig>  l. oceanica nucleomorph introns using illumina transcriptome data . for the b. natans nucleomorph,  <dig> new splice sites were also identified and corrected using illumina rna-seq data. with these adjustments, the total number of spliceosomal introns in the b. natans nucleomorph genome has increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  as in b. natans, the l. oceanica introns have canonical gt-ag intron boundaries, with the exception of three introns . most of these introns are 18–23 bp in size. one intron, within an rna helicase gene , was found to be 32 nt, which is the largest nucleomorph intron known .

the size distribution of introns in the l. oceanica and b. natans genomes is shown in figure 
 <dig>  the pattern of intron abundance versus size in l. oceanica is similar to that in b. natans in that 19 nt-long introns are most abundant , although the proportion of 19 nt introns in l. oceanica  is smaller than in b. natans . in l. oceanica, the size distribution is shifted towards longer introns  are  <dig> % and  <dig> %, whereas the proportion of >20 nt introns are  <dig> % and  <dig> % in l. oceanica and b. natans, respectively) . a previous comparison of introns in  <dig> homologous genes in the b. natans and g. stellata nucleomorph genomes 
 <cit>  showed that the g. stellata genome also possesses a higher proportion of 19 nt-introns  than b. natans . the distribution pattern of intron size was somewhat shifted to longer intron size in g. stellata . the fact that the ~ <dig> kbp g. stellata nucleomorph genome is estimated to be ~ <dig> kbp larger than b. natans and tends to have longer introns than b. natans is consistent with our l. oceanica data in showing a positive correlation between nucleomorph genome size and intron length.figure  <dig>

 <cit> .



in terms of phase and base composition, the l. oceanica and b. natans nucleomorph introns are similar. specifically, there is an abundance of phase  <dig> introns at similar proportions , a bias towards a residues at position - <dig>  and high a + t content in the intron sequences themselves . the latter two features are also seen in g. stellata nucleomorph introns 
 <cit> .

 <dig> and  <dig> introns were found in  <dig> homologous nucleomorph genes shared between l. oceanica and b. natans. of these introns, 151 l. oceanica and  <dig> b. natans introns were comparable under the criteria used by roy and penny 
 <cit>  . in terms of intron position,  <dig> introns were shared between these two species . in order to gain insight into patterns of intron gain and loss during reductive evolution,  <dig> introns not shared between l. oceanica and b. natans were compared with those of two well-studied species, the plant arabidopsis thaliana and the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii. as shown in additional file 
 <dig>  one intron in rpc <dig> was absent only in l. oceanica and two introns  were absent only in b. natans. in these cases we can safely infer intron loss in l. oceanica and b. natans. based on the fact that the intron density in the b. natans nucleomorph genome is similar to that of c. reinhardtii and a. thaliana, slamovits and keeling 
 <cit>  suggested that nucleomorph intron loss is rare. our comparison of b. natans and l. oceanica shows a high similarity in the number of introns in homologous genes, and is consistent with this notion.

phylogenetic analyses
a fundamental question in the evolution of chlorarachniophyte algae is the nature of the green algal endosymbiont that gave rise to the plastid and nucleomorph. previous phylogenetic trees inferred from concatenated plastid-encoded proteins suggested that the chlorarachniophyte endosymbiont was related to the so-called tuc group of green algae, consisting of trebouxiophytes, ulvophytes, and chlorophytes, within the core chlorophytes 
. however, the precise position of the chlorarachniophyte plastid and nucleomorph within the tuc group was unclear. we attempted to address this issue by assembling and analyzing a large data set including both nucleomorph and plastid proteins.

the taxon and data resources used in these analyses are shown in additional file 
 <dig>  three separate supermatrices were constructed:  a 52-protein dataset containing nucleomorph and nuclear proteins  sites),  a  <dig> plastid protein set  and  a 99-protein combined set  . maximum likelihood trees inferred using the raxml method

 <cit> , l. oceanica and b. natans grouped with the tuc group and the mamiellophyceae with maximum support . together, these analyses are consistent with the hypothesis that the endosymbiont that gave rise to the chlorarachniophyte nucleomorph and plastid was more closely related to members of the tuc group than the other green algal members. however, the branching pattern within the tuc clade, including the chlorarachniophytes, was not resolved by ml analysis . therefore, although the analyses presented herein use the most gene-rich datasets thus far assembled to address the question of the origin of the chlorarachniophyte endosymbiont, they still lack sufficient taxon sampling and the resolution needed to elucidate the relationship between chlorarachniophytes and the members of the tuc clade. l. oceanica and b. natans are clearly the longest branches in our trees, with the exception of the non-photosynthetic euglenoid, euglena longa, in the plastid tree. these long branch lengths suggest that substitution rates in the nucleomorph and plastid genomes have accelerated after secondary endosymbiosis. such long branches are well known as the cause of phylogenetic artifacts.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
we have sequenced the nucleomorph and plastid genomes of the chlorarachniophyte l. oceanica. the l. oceanica nucleomorph genome is the largest sequenced so far within the chlorarachniophytes, ~ <dig> kbp larger than that of b. natans. large, nearly identical sub-telomeric repeats on each of the six chromosome ends are the main contributors to its increased size, an apparent consequence of frequent homologous recombination at the chromosome ends that serve to expand and contract these regions in different species. internally duplicated regions have also contributed to the secondary expansion of the l. oceanica nucleomorph genome. the l. oceanica nucleomorph genome contains  <dig> protein genes .  <dig> %  of the eukaryotic conserved genes  and all the plastid-associated genes were shared between l. oceanica and b. natans. intron sizes and positions were also conserved. the presence of an overlap between the core gene sets in chlorarachniophyte and cryptophyte nucleomorph genomes speaks to convergent patterns of gene retention in these independently evolved nucleomorphs. in contrast to its dynamically evolving nucleomorph genome, the l. oceanica plastid genome is highly similar to the b. natans plastid genome in terms of genome size, gene content and gene synteny. phylogenetic trees inferred from large datasets consisting of nucleomorph-/nucleus- and plastid-encoded proteins support the idea that the endosymbiont that gave rise to the chlorarachniophyte plastid and nucleomorph was a relative of the tuc group of green algae. further phylogenetic resolution will require sequence data from more diverse members of the chlorarachniophytes, which will also improve our understanding of the tempo and mode of nucleomorph and plastid genome evolution in these enigmatic unicellular algae.
