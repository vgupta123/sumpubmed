BACKGROUND
small rnas  are a key component of rna-based regulatory system with basic regulatory mechanisms being conserved in eukaryotes. plant tissues contain significant quantities of srnas  <cit> , which are usually processed from long double-stranded rna  precursors by rnase iii enzymes. these srnas can be divided into two major categories: small interfering rnas  and micrornas . although a smaller proportion of the total srna population, mirnas are less diverse and particular mirnas can dominate the stoichiometry amongst individual srna species  <cit> .

by ingesting plant material, animals are exposed to considerable amount of rna including srnas. given the diverse number of sequences present in srna populations, complementary matches to transcripts in animal consumers are readily identifiable  <cit> . such complementary srnas are unlikely to be involved in heterologous regulation of gene expression in animals. in order to achieve any impact on gene expression in a consuming organism, srnas would need to be absorbed and distributed in biologically relevant quantities within the cells of animal tissues and organs. there are a number of key biological barriers to oral activity of ingested nucleic acids, including the harsh ph environment of the stomach and rna-destructive condition of the gastrointestinal  tract where nucleases and associated microbiota are present  <cit> . any nucleic acids that are absorbed must also escape nucleases in cellular compartments and in the bloodstream thus limiting any potential activity of exogenous rna molecules  <cit> . furthermore, nucleic acid therapeutics usually lack systemic activity following intravenous injection due to their rapid filtration by the kidney and renal elimination  <cit> . for these reasons, delivery of oligonucleotide therapeutics does not occur orally but is administered locally or systemically with the use of specialized lipophilic delivery vehicles and synthetic modifications to native rna structure.

a recent publication  <cit>  suggests that some plant mirnas can pass through the animal gi track and enter the circulatory system and various organs presumably protected by association with microvesicles. interestingly, mature mir <dig> was one of the plant mirnas detected at the highest level in mice fed with raw rice. to address the question how widespread this phenomenon is in the animal kingdom, we conducted an analysis of public srna datasets from various vertebrate and invertebrate animals for presence of plant mirna sequences. surprisingly, the mir <dig> sequence was detected as the predominant or sole plant mirna in animal datasets, including insect examples from different phylogenetic lineages, representing diverse digestive anatomy and physiology. publically available insect srna datasets were limited, however, so we initiated controlled feeding experiments in readily accessible, lab-reared lepidopteran and coleopteran insect representatives to examine if mirna uptake is a general faculty of insects. diabrotica virgifera vergifera leconte  was included in the analysis since its responsiveness to ingested plant-produced dsrna was previously established  <cit> . in addition to the public data analysis results, here we also describe the observations of mirna uptake as a result of plant feeding in selected insects.

RESULTS
computational analysis of animal public srna datasets identified plant derived mirnas
we examined the prevalence of identifiable plant mirnas in srna datasets derived from various animal sources with different sampling techniques and experimental and analytical methodologies. of  <dig> animal srna public datasets used for analysis,  <dig>  had at least one sequence that had perfect identity to a known plant mirna . in  <dig> datasets, plant mirna reads were at least  <dig> % of the total animal mirna reads  for samples from human , mouse , pig , pea aphid , and silkworm  . the most abundant plant mirna sequence observed in any instance is numerically not within the top  <dig> most abundant endogenous animal mirna. significant variation exists in the number of observed plant mirnas even in datasets from the same tissue or experimental repetition. for example,  <dig> out of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads from srr <dig>  match to plant mirnas, while none were observed in  <dig> , <dig> reads from srr <dig> . the highest observed ratio of plant mirnas/animal mirnas is  <dig> %, which is  <dig> times lower than a figure of ~5% reported by zhang et al.  <cit> .

for all the datasets analyzed, reads mapping to plant mirnas were mostly or exclusively mir <dig>  except for the pig abdominal fat dataset  where the most abundant plant mirna family is mir <dig>  which accounts for  <dig> % of total plant mirnas within the plant-specific mirnas observed in that sample . the second and third most abundant mirnas in the pig abdominal fat dataset are mir <dig> and mir <dig>  with  <dig> and  <dig> reads, respectively . interestingly, the mir <dig> sequence in pig is predominately ucgcuuggugcaggucgggaa, which is found in dicots such as arabidopsis , soybean , and brassica napus . in contrast, predominate mir <dig> sequence in other datasets is ucgcuuggugcagaucgggac, which is only found in monocots such as rice , corn , and sorghum bicolor  .

grain is likely the route of exposure to plant mirnas for many domesticated animals, so we evaluated the mirna abundance from the seed of rice, corn and soybean, using our srna sequence data. mir <dig> is highly expressed in corn kernel and rice grain, but is not the most abundant mirna in these plants. in soybean seed, mir <dig> ranks below 20th within the steady-state abundance of mirnas . this observation suggests that the presence of mir <dig> as a dominant plant mirna in animal srna datasets from animal tissues cannot be explained simply as a reflection of its relative mirna abundance in plants. srna northern blot analysis of select mirnas from different plant sources that are variously parts of animal diets corroborates our sequencing result that mir <dig> is equal to or less abundant than other plant mirnas in soybean, rice and corn seed .

to investigate whether the observed plant mirnas are potentially encoded by animal genomes, we compared some of the most abundant plant mirnas in public animal srna datasets against the national center for biotechnology information  nucleotide sequence database , but excluded plant sequences. the plant mirnas used in the search include mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  we did not observe any perfect matches between plant mirnas and non-plant sequences from nt dataset, which includes sequences from animals, fungi, bacteria, and viruses. thus, any plant mirnas detected in animal datasets are likely not to be derived from genomes of the host, pathogens, or microbiota associated with the animals.

analysis of plant mirna in insects
in order to validate the direct impact of a food source upon the selective accumulation of mir <dig> in insects, we conducted controlled feeding experiments and srna northern blot analysis to detect mir <dig> and other srnas in helicoverpa zea boddie , spodoptera frugiperda j.e.smith  and wcr feeding on natural plant tissues. for the lepidopteran larvae, cew and faw neonates were each split into two groups and fed on one of two plant food sources that have known mir <dig> nucleotide sequences that are distinguished by two nucleotide differences . larvae were grown to the third or fifth instar on the selected food source before sampling for analysis. although mir <dig> was easily observed in the plant samples used for feeding , northern blot analysis did not reveal detectable mir <dig> signal in tested insects . blots were stripped and re-probed with insect-specific mirnas , indicating the consistent quality of srna prepared from insects. to eliminate the possibility of non-detection due to sensitivity limits of northern blot analysis, we performed deep sequencing on the samples to evaluate the possibility of low level presence of plant-derived mirnas. three non-feeding neonate plus  <dig> corn- or soybean-fed instar insect libraries were sequenced in one multiplexed run  with  <dig> plant libraries. plant mirnas were detected in all insect libraries including neonate libraries . unlike publically available datasets, the predominant detected plant mirna for most insect libraries sequenced, including corn-fed insect libraries, is mir <dig>  which is not found in monocots such as corn. mir <dig> is the dominant mirna in only one insect library . even in this instance, the number of reads mapped to mir <dig> is moderate. for all other insect libraries, mir <dig> represents no more than the seventh most abundant number of reads that map to plant mirnas . presence of mir <dig> comparable to that observed in pea aphid and silkworm from ncbi was not observed in cew, faw, and wcr.

discussion
monocot mir <dig> observed is disproportionately abundant in the public animal datasets and may be adventitious in some circumstances
monocot mir <dig> is the dominant or singular plant mirna observed in most analyzed public srna animal datasets. this result is unlikely due to trivial contamination of animal srna libraries with plant material, because in any plant tissue, multiple plant mirnas are expressed and mir <dig> in many cases is not the most abundant plant mirna . we hypothesize that the plant mirna abundance detected in animal tissue datasets should reflect the distribution of mirnas in plant tissues unless mir <dig> undergoes preferential uptake or stabilization in animals, or that alternatively there is active discrimination against more abundant plant mirnas. the public datasets where mir <dig> sequence is over-represented in detected plant mirnas are from insects, chicken and mammals. these animals belong to distinct lineages with diverse digestive anatomy and physiology. this could implicate a special property of mir <dig> and select additional mirnas to be preferentially stable and/or have particular associations with other factors that protect and shepherd them through the gi tract and into distal organs. however, the appearance of mir <dig> does not align with the experimental setup in all cases. for instance, over 99% of mir <dig> from pea aphid and 100% of mir <dig> from silkworm datasets are of monocot origin . these two insects populations were, however, reared on the dicot plants broad bean  and mulberry , respectively  <cit> . while neither of these dicot food sources have publically accessible srna datasets to confirm fortuitous identity to the monocot version of mir <dig>  datasets are available for soybean and medicago truncatula  support the likely conservation of dicot mir <dig> sequence in broad bean. furthermore, our insect feeding experiments did not reveal any specific/preferential accumulation of mir <dig> in insects fed on a plant diet containing mir <dig>  combined, our observations suggest that the observed predominant monocot mir <dig> sequence is present as a result of contamination from a non-plant source.

possibilities of contamination from biological sources
for the  <dig> public animal srna datasets with numerous sequence reads that matched to plant mirnas , if we exclude the datasets where plant mirnas are overwhelmingly monocot mir <dig>  then only two  have significant levels of plant mirnas other than mir <dig>  there are two possibilities for the presence of plant mirnas in these two datasets: diet and from plant material contamination. if the former is true, then it is hard to explain why plant mirnas are not detected at significant levels in most other datasets where animals are feeding on plant materials. in this manuscript we have analyzed six pig srna datasets . datasets srr <dig>  and srr <dig>  are from the same pig individual as the plant mirna-rich dataset srr <dig>  <cit> , but have much fewer reads matched to plant mirnas . the datasets srr <dig> and srr <dig> are from the same pig tissue, but from two individuals who form the full-sib f <dig> female pair in the experiment  <cit> . the ratio for srr <dig> is nearly  <dig> times lower  than that for srr <dig> .

in next-generation high-throughput sequencing technologies, multiplexing is used such that a number of libraries are sequenced together in one run. these libraries can be from different samples, experiments and/or organisms, and cross-contamination could arise in sequencing in such studies. contamination may also occur in earlier steps before sequencing, such as library preparation. next-generation high-throughput sequencing has been much more widely used in animal studies than in plant studies. according to the ncbi sequence read archive  database, there are  <dig>  archived metazoa experiments versus  <dig>  for viridiplantae. as such, public animal srna datasets analyzed in this manuscript are more likely to be contaminated by other animal samples than by plant samples. to test this hypothesis, we searched public human srna datasets for non-human animal mirnas to look for further evidence of adventitious sequences. a significant number of reads mapping to non-human animal mirnas but not to known human mirna or the human reference genome were detected in all human datasets, including datasets for cultured cell lines . the most abundant non-human/mammalian animal-derived mirnas detected in the human datasets were from fish, insects, chicken and frogs. since by-products from these non-mammalian sources are typically not utilized in human cell culture media, the presence of mirnas from these species in human cultured cell datasets is very likely from contamination versus dietary contribution. this result indicates that contamination should be considered during data interpretation when analyzing srna dataset from different sources.

we noted the occurrence of sequencing-derived presence of plant srnas within our own sequencing run  <dig>  where insect and lettuce libraries were multiplexed. one lettuce-specific sequence that produced numerous srnas in lettuce libraries also appeared in the insect data. a low number of raw reads from all insect libraries map to the lettuce specific sequence . for the failed insect library which was successfully re-sequenced in run  <dig>  where no lettuce libraries were sequenced, none of its raw reads map to the lettuce-specific sequence. this indicates that cross contamination of the multiplexed libraries has occurred.

in addition, mir <dig> detected from corn and soybean-fed insect libraries in run  <dig> has a mixture of dicot and monocot mirna sequences, i.e., both dicot and monocot mir <dig> sequences are detected in corn-fed insects and in soybean-fed insects . since in the same run there are  <dig> lettuce leaf libraries, one soybean leaf library and two corn libraries, it is very likely that monocot mir <dig> in soybean-fed insects results from contamination from the corn library and the dicot mir <dig> in corn-fed insects is from soybean/lettuce libraries.

if contamination contributes to the observation of mir <dig> in our wcr, cew, and faw datasets, then other plant mirnas should be similarly affected. therefore, we also compared plant mirna expression patterns between insect and source plant libraries, and between all insect and all plant libraries in run  <dig>  as shown in additional file  <dig>  plant mirna abundance distribution for insects fed on corn is different from that of the source corn tissues, because there are several relatively highly abundant plant mirnas in insect datasets but are very low or absent in the corn datasets. in contrast, plant mirna expression patterns are similar between the group including plant mirnas from all plant library reads and the group including plant mirnas from all insect library reads in the run, strongly suggesting that all plant libraries within the multiplexed run contribute to the observed plant mirnas in insect datasets. since in the run most plant libraries are from dicot leaves  and they share similar mirna expressions, it is not surprising that the insects fed on soybean leaf has a similar plant mirna expression pattern to that of its source tissue, i.e., soybean leaf .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our analysis suggests that plant mirnas observed in some public animal srna datasets and our own insect feeding experiment sequence data may be artifactual due to sequencing methodology, and that accumulation of plant mirnas via diet is not a common faculty among animals. additional investigation is needed to address discrepancies observed in different studies, determine if adventitious presence accounts for all observations, ascertain the nature of enrichment where it appears to have occurred, and verify whether or not plant srna accumulation and circulation occurs at functional levels in some animal species.
