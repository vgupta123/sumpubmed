BACKGROUND
many genes containing tandem exon arrays undergo mutually exclusive alternative splicing, in which only one exon variant within a tandem array of related variants is incorporated into the mature transcript  <cit> . in the fruit fly, drosophila melanogaster, this form of alternative splicing can potentially produce  <dig>  distinct, mature rnas from a single gene, down syndrome cell adhesion molecule   <cit> . similar arrays of exon variants have been reported in homologs of dscam from other diptera , the honeybee apis mellifera   <cit> , and most recently the flour beetle tribolium castaneum  and the silk moth bombyx mori   <cit> .

the fly dscam gene encodes proteins that are members of the immunoglobulin  superfamily of cell adhesion molecules, and appears to be involved in neuronal axon guidance and bifurcation  <cit> . it may also be involved in adaptive immunity in insects  <cit> . the protein is comprised of both an extracellular domain that is highly conserved between insect and vertebrate species, and an intracellular domain for which there is little sequence similarity between the insects and vertebrates. nonetheless, it has been shown in both groups that the intracellular domain activates pak <dig>  <cit> , though in the insects this is an indirect interaction through the adaptor protein dock.

the name of the gene derives from the fact that one of the designated human dscam homologs maps to a down syndrome-associated region on chromosome 21; down syndrome is the most common inherited form of mental retardation  <cit> . another homolog, dscam-like, maps to a locus on chromosome  <dig> that is associated with the neurological disorders giles de la tourette syndrome and jacobsen syndrome  <cit> . though evidence indicates that human dscam may perform similar functions as its fly homolog, the specific functional role of the human dscam protein are still under investigation  <cit> . to date, the human dscam gene has been reported to produce only three alternative transcripts  <cit> , raising a question about the extent to which transcriptional diversity is found among members of the gene family as a whole.

to address this question, we first located then analyzed the evolution of exons homologous to those within fly dscam that contain tandem arrays of alternative splice variants: exons  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>   <cit> . these exons code for extracellular and transmembrane domains of the protein. a tandem exon array consists of multiple variants, each of which contains a unique alternative 5'  and 3'  splice site. only one variant from an array is incorporated into each mature transcript, and different transcripts may incorporate different variants. the variants in dscam presumably arose through tandem exon duplication, since they share similar sequences. exon arrays containing three or fewer variants have been observed in humans  <cit> , and few cases of large tandem arrays are known, such as pcdh genes, some of which have up to  <dig> variable exons in a tandem array  <cit> . several other genes in vertebrates have also been found to have variable first exons in tandem arrays which undergo alternative splicing  <cit> . notably, however, such exon arrays appear to be absent from human dscam and dscam-like genes  <cit> .

because there is a striking difference in the levels of transcript diversity that can be generated among the homologs of this gene  <cit> , it is an intriguing system for studying the evolution of mutually exclusive splicing. here we address a number of outstanding questions about this gene family. do tandem arrays of exons homologous to those in fly dscam exist elsewhere in non-insect genomes? if not, were tandem arrays lost along the lineage leading to mammals or gained along the lineage leading to insects? do the exon variants undergo turnover within the array and, if so, how rapidly? are the rate and mode of evolution similar among the different exon arrays?

to answer these questions, we began with the dscam exon variants from each of the fly exon arrays  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  performing searches for homologous exons amongst sixteen genomes  and filtering those matches by criteria described in the methods. once the sets of homologous exons were identified, we used bayesian methods to infer the phylogeny of each one.

RESULTS
homologous sequences are present only within the arthropoda, nematoda, and vertebrata
the phylogenetic relationships among the sixteen taxa included in this study are shown in figure  <dig>  collectively, we identified a total of  <dig>  exon sequences homologous to the fly exon arrays in the vertebrate, nematode and insect genomes. homologous sequences were not found in the yeast, sea urchin, tunicate, or plant genomes. assuming that homologous sequences were most likely present in the most recent common ancestor of vertebrates, nematodes, and insects rather than acquired via horizontal transfer, the absence of homologous sequences from sea urchins and tunicates suggests that they have been lost from these genomes or have diverged beyond recognition. we also searched for sequences homologous to the constitutive exons that flank the tandem arrays  within the fly dscam gene. homologs were not found in the yeast or plant genomes but were found in the tunicate, sea urchin, nematode, vertebrate, and insect genomes. the fact that regions similar to constitutive exons of dscam were found within tunicate and sea urchin but that the alternatively spliced exons were not suggests unique selective pressures between the two classes of exon.

the number and taxonomic distribution of homologs varies among the exons. sets seeded with exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of d. melanogaster contained  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> members, respectively. each set contained all of the exons in the corresponding d. melanogaster exon array. for exon arrays  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  each mammalian species possessed only one homolog within an annotated dscam gene . each also possesses a single homolog to the dscam-like gene . variants of the fly exon  <dig> array are also homologous to over  <dig> sequences within the titin gene on human chromosome  <dig>  we have also found homologous sequences to exon arrays  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in zebrafish, tetraodon, fugu, frog, and dog genomes where neither dscam nor dscam-like had been annotated at the time of this study.

each of the  <dig> sequences homologous to the exon  <dig> array were from the insect genomes studied . there do not appear to be any sequences homologous to the exon  <dig> array within either of the mammalian paralogs, dscam or dscam-like, nor anywhere else within a non-insect genome.

within the insect genomes we found the reported number of annotated splice variants for each exon array  <cit> . in fly we identified twelve exon  <dig> variants, forty-eight exon  <dig> variants, thirty-three exon  <dig> variants and two exon  <dig> variants. we also found the expected mosquito and honeybee exon  <dig> variants  and the exon  <dig> variants . fly exon  <dig> variants are homologous to exon  <dig> variants in both mosquito and honeybee, where we found the reported thirty-eight exon  <dig> splice variants in mosquito and seventeen in honeybee. fly exon  <dig> is homologous to mosquito exon  <dig> and honeybee exon  <dig>  we found the two variants for each of these exons. interestingly, we identified new homologs to fly exons  <dig> and  <dig> that were dispersed throughout the fly, mosquito and honeybee genomes. these are shown as "homolog_ " in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  and their chromosomal locations are listed in additional file  <dig> 

tandem arrays are only present in the insect dscam genes
none of the vertebrate exon homologs we found, including those in genomes where dscam was unannotated, were contained within tandem arrays, with the exception of matches in the human titin gene. the new vertebrate homologs appear to correspond to multiple genes in each vertebrate genome examined, as evidenced by their physical locations . furthermore, the newly identified homologs within fly, mosquito and honeybee were all found at unique positions, indicating that none of these are situated in tandem arrays. we examined the  <dig> homologs of fly exon  <dig> found within the human titin gene, by searching these sequences against titin transcripts. the transcript cad <dig>  had matches for  <dig> of the fly homologs with 100% identity, and np_ <dig>   had  <dig> perfect matches. the simultaneous matching of a majority of exons within individual transcripts strongly suggests that these homologs do not undergo mutually exclusive splicing. our result does not rule out other forms of splicing, and in fact titin is known to undergo extensive splicing that results in variable length transcripts due to exon-skipping .

taken in sum, these results indicate that none of these dscam exon homologs undergo mutually exclusive splicing outside of the arthropods.

vertebrate dscam homologs can be distinguished by core residues
we generated protein multiple sequence alignments  for the four sets of homologous sequences. there are  <dig> residues in the edited alignment for exon  <dig>   <dig> for exon  <dig>   <dig> for exon  <dig>  and  <dig> for exon  <dig>  the alignments consist of homologs from the annotated dscam genes and the new homologs we found.

analysis of the msas revealed that the sequences corresponding to the mammalian dscam and dscam-like genes  could be distinguished using 5â€“ <dig> specific residues from each exon. panels a, b and c within figure  <dig> show a portion of the msa for fly exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the figure shows all of the vertebrate dscam homologs and a single homolog from each of the three insects. the exon  <dig> msa contains diagnostic residues at five positions:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> : the dscam motif for these six residues is lietl while the dscam-like motif is flqsi. within the exon  <dig> msa the sequences corresponding to the mammalian dscam and dscam-like genes can be distinguished by residues at nine positions:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> : qdtrlraeq in dscam and remqvstse in dscam-like. the exon  <dig> msa contains diagnostic residues at nine different positions:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> : lkgvlfrrr and isdfvvkkk in dscam and dscam-like, respectively. these diagnostic residues can be used to infer whether unannotated sequences belong to the mammalian dscam or dscam-like lineages.

phylogenetic relationships
we obtained unrooted phylogenetic trees by bayesian analysis of the nucleotide sequence alignments for each of the four exons. in each case, the position of the root is uncertain since there is no clear outgroup sequence. these trees are shown in figs.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and discussed below.

tandem arrays for exons  <dig> and  <dig> are highly conserved among insects
exons  <dig> and  <dig> share similar features, as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in both trees, there is a well-supported high-level clade  that includes the annotated dscam exon variants from fly, mosquito and honeybee. the clade i sequences in the exon  <dig> tree also include a single unannotated sequence from fly and mosquito.

in both trees, clade i can be subdivided into well-supported subclades, two in exon  <dig>  and at least five subclades in exon  <dig>  as shown in figure 5a. though the definition of the subclades is somewhat arbitrary, most of the subclades are represented by at least one variant in fly, mosquito and honeybee. the substantial depth of each subclade relative to the shallow divergence among sequences from fly, mosquito and honeybee suggests that the diversification of the variant lineages within the tandem array  long predates the divergence of these three species.

for exon  <dig>  the position of variants from each subclade within the array is strikingly similar in the three species, as shown in figure 5b. this indicates that there has been very little turnover of exon variants for at least 243â€“ <dig> million years since these three species separated  <cit> , and judging by the branch lengths, probably considerably longer. this conservation in the structure of the array strongly suggests that the subclades of alternatively spliced variants evolved specialized functions long prior to divergence of the insect taxa under study.

the trees for exons  <dig> and  <dig> also contain a well supported clade  that contains only vertebrate sequences. in both cases, clade ii can be subdivided into two subclades. subclade a is comprised of sequences from the dscam lineage  and subclade b is comprised of sequences from the dscam-like lineage . the vertebrate dscam and dscam-like sequences are more closely related to each other than either is to the insect dscam genes.

only the exon  <dig> tree contains clade iii  and there is strong support  for the monophyly of this small clade of unannotated insect sequences. these three sequences lie outside the annotated dscam exons in fly , mosquito  and honeybee . the branch lengths separating the annotated insect dscam sequences  from clades ii  and clade iii  are roughly comparable.

only insects contain homologs to exon 6
exon  <dig> presents a strong contrast to exon  <dig> and  <dig>  the phylogenetic tree for exon  <dig> is comprised of the annotated dscam exon variants from fly, mosquito and honeybee, together with unannotated sequences from these same genomes . no homologous sequences were found within the vertebrates or other non-insect genomes. many of the variant lineages radiate from near the midpoint of the tree and have relatively weak support. the clustering of variants from individual species suggests that many of the present-day variants proliferated after divergence of the insect species, or that the variants have undergone recombination.

exon  <dig> has experienced high turnover since divergence of the insects
exon  <dig> is similar to exons  <dig> and  <dig> in that there is relatively good resolution of the phylogeny , and sequences from vertebrates are present. however, the turnover within the insects is, at least superficially, more similar to the pattern seen in exon  <dig>  there are two well-supported high-level clades. clade i  contains the annotated insect dscam exon variants and also an unannotated sequence from the nematode, while clade ii  contains the vertebrate sequences.

the monophyly of clade i is supported by a branch with a posterior probability of  <dig> , assuming that the root is outside the group. the species-specific clusters of exon variants in clade i indicate that, like exon  <dig>  exon  <dig> has undergone substantial radiation after divergence of the insect species or that there has been recombination among the variants. the single nematode homolog  is nested among insect sequences within clade i. the position of the sequence within the clade suggests that it diverged from its closest insect homologs after the establishment of the tandem array. this would imply that the array was present but lost in the nematoda . however, the two branches supporting this derived position have relatively low support , and so the nematode sequence could plausibly branch from a node at the base of this clade. this latter placement would be consistent with the origin of the array after the divergence of the arthropoda from the nematoda .

clade ii of exon  <dig>  containing the vertebrate sequences, is supported by a posterior probability of  <dig> . as in exon  <dig>  the vertebrate dscam and dscam-like sequences are much more closely related to each other than either is to fly dscam. the annotated mammalian dscam sequences and dscam-like sequences can also be divided into two well-supported subclades a and b  with the exception of the two rodent dscam sequences. subclade a  contains the annotated human dscam sequence and single sequences from dog, fugu and zebrafish. subclade b  contains the annotated human and rodent dscam-like sequences, a second sequence from both frog and dog, and the sole sequence from tetraodon. there is strong support for the divergence of the single fugu sequence  prior to the split between subclades a and b. curiously, the well-supported relationships within clade ii are not entirely consistent with the phylogeny of the vertebrates. for example, clades containing dog and fish sequences are sister to the other mammalian sequences in both subclades a and b. this suggests that either the phylogenetic topology is incorrect or that there has been a complex history of unobserved duplications and losses.

conservation of exon-to-protein domain correspondence between fly and human
we identified the exons and corresponding putative protein domains for fly dscam, human dscam, and human dscam-l, to examine the correspondence between the variable exons and domains. these results are shown in figure  <dig>  for the fly dscam protein, interproscan produced a structure very similar to that shown by schmucker et al.  <cit> , with nine consecutive ig domains  followed by six fibronectin domains  with another ig between the fourth and fifth fibronectin. exons  <dig> and  <dig> correspond to the first part of ig domains  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and exon  <dig> covers all of ig domain  <dig>  this is followed by the transmembrane domain, corresponding to exon  <dig>  uniprot annotations for human dscam and dscam-l showed a highly similar domain structure to that obtained for fly. interestingly, for each of the fly exons and their human homologs in both genes, the locations are nearly identical with respect to the protein domain structure.

discussion
the extraordinary difference between the fly and human dscam homologs in the extent of potential transcript diversity motivated us to investigate the phylogenetic origin of mutually exclusive alternative splicing in the four exon arrays of the dscam gene.

the origins of mutually exclusive splicing in dscam
homologs to all four exons were present in tandem arrays in the insect genomes, as previously reported  <cit> . three of the four exons  also had homologs in vertebrates, and one  had a homolog in nematode. however, outside of the three insects that we examined, no homologs were arranged in tandem arrays. this includes the nematode homolog to exon  <dig> and all the newly identified vertebrate sequences  from exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  thus, the absence of mutually exclusive alternative splicing in the human dscam and dscam-like genes  <cit>  represents either an innovation in the lineage leading to insects, or one or more ancient losses from the common ancestor of insects, nematodes and vertebrates, approximately a billion years ago  <cit> . the one exon for which there is any evidence of loss in the lineage leading to vertebrates is exon  <dig>  and this is due to a single worm sequence nested with low confidence within the clade of insect variants .

we found no homologs to the alternatively spliced fly dscam exons within the yeast, tunicate, sea urchin and plant genomes. for the constitutive exons that we examined, no homologs were not found in yeast or plant genomes. however, potential homologs to several of the constitutive exons  were found within the tunicate and sea urchin genomes. since the phylogeny indicates that homologs to the fly exon  <dig> group must have existed in the common ancestor of nematodes, deuterostomes and arthropods, any exon  <dig> homologs must have either been lost from the sea urchin and tunicate genomes or have diverged beyond recognition.

differential conservation of variants within tandem arrays in the insects
the sequences and numbers of exon variants among the insect dscam tandem exon arrays are all surprisingly well conserved  <cit> , though we found that the arrays have experienced very different patterns of proliferation and turnover. in exons  <dig> and  <dig>  the variants were apparently established in an ancient burst of invention and have undergone relatively little turnover since divergence of the diptera  and the hymenoptera . by contrast, exons  <dig> and  <dig> appear to have undergone substantial radiation even since the more recent divergence of fly and mosquito. many nodes in the phylogenies of exons  <dig> and  <dig> have weak support, particularly for the basal branches. this suggests an early period of rapid radiation in these arrays. alternatively, there may have been recombination among the variants early in the history of these two arrays. the contrast among the four different exons suggests that, as functional units within the dscam gene, they are evolving largely independently of one another.

implications for the functional divergence of vertebrate and insect dscam genes
the absence of tandem arrays in any of the vertebrate dscam homologs indicates that they do not participate in mutually exclusive alternative splicing and therefore lack the diversity of protein isoforms generated through this form of splicing. we know that the intracellular domains of the insect and vertebrate proteins both participate in the same signaling pathway , but by different means  <cit> . as well, our results indicate strong conservation of the exon to protein domain correspondence between fly and the human dscam homologs. the similarity in protein sequence of the insect and vertebrate extracellular ig domains , combined with recent experimental evidence for specific homophilic interactions  <cit>  suggests that the encoded protein domains are functionally homologous. furthermore, an ig domain  is absent from the human dscam protein. these points raise the following question: is the functionality of the diverse dscam protein isoforms in insects not necessary in the vertebrate homologs, or is it achieved through other means, possibly including other forms of post-transcriptional or post-translational processing?

the recent paper by watson et. al, demonstrates that in the fruit fly and other insects, mutually exclusive alternative splicing in dscam appears to play a role in adaptive immunity  <cit> . while this finding has led to the suggestion that mutually exclusive alternative splicing in the insect dscam gene is solely related to its role in immunity, and not in axon guidance  <cit> , there is a growing body of evidence that the alternative isoforms do in fact play a role in axon guidance  <cit> . members of the immunoglobulin family in vertebrates are also involved in adaptive immunity, but generate protein isoform diversity through somatic gene rearrangements rather than alternative splicing at the rna level. since dscam contains immunoglobulin domains, and is now shown to be involved in adaptive immunity in insects, there is an intriguing possibility that, in vertebrates, a diversity of protein isoforms is achieved through somatic rearrangement of the dscam and dscam-like genes.

other cases of mutually exclusive alternative splicing
though tandem arrays of dscam homologs are absent outside the insects, many other genes exhibiting alternative splicing have been found  <cit> . for example, in humans the neurexin and titin genes have been shown to participate in mutually exclusive splicing,  <cit>  and the three neurexin genes can potentially generate more than one thousand isoforms through this process  <cit> . this indicates that mutually exclusive alternative splicing can generate diverse protein isoforms in humans as it does within insects. however, the mutually exclusive splicing in these genes involves tandem arrays of three or fewer variants. where larger arrays of exons undergoing this type of splicing have been found in vertebrates, they appear to be confined to the first exons of the gene  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our findings illustrate a striking contrast between the conservation of several large exon arrays in insect dscam and the lack of any such arrays among vertebrates. contrary to previous reports of high turnover  <cit> , we found evidence for the maintenance of ancient structural patterns within the arrays, especially within exon  <dig>  the four tandem arrays show different patterns of proliferation and conservation but the weight of evidence points to all four arrays having evolved after the divergence of arthropods from deuterostomes and nematodes. it remains to be determined whether the contrast between insect and vertebrate dscam reflects functional divergence between the genes, or whether a distinct mechanism is acting to produce a similar diversity of transcripts in vertebrates.
