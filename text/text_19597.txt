BACKGROUND
ventral root avulsion is not similar to distal axotomy, which does not cause mn death in adult animals  <cit> . in contrast, avulsion of the spinal roots isolates the mns from peripheral nerves and glial cells, causing several interrelated damage processes in mns, including morphological alterations, biochemical disturbances, gene expression dysregulation, metabolic changes and cell deathin the affected spinal cordsegments  <cit> . the vast majority of the corresponding spinal mns die within 2– <dig> weeks of injury in adult rats  <cit> , resulting in paralysis of the corresponding muscle groups because the brachial plexus is the only nerve supply to the upper limb. surgical reimplantation of avulsed ventral roots can rescue the mns in this model. however, the implantation, which inserts the avulsed ventral rootlets into the parenchyma of the spinal cord, may cause additional damage to the spinal cord and requires more challenging surgical skills. in this study, we employed a new microsurgical technique to restore the connection by positioning the avulsed ventral root on the ventrolateral pial surface of the spinal cord instead of inserting the ventral rootlets into the parenchyma of the spinal cord  <cit> . however, the growth velocity of the regenerative mn axons is too slow to re-innervate the intrinsic forepaw muscles before the denervated muscle atrophies  <cit> . we also estimated the effect of drugs on the enhancement of the growth velocity of the regenerative mn axons. lithium, which is extensively used in the treatment of bipolar mood disorder in clinical settings, has been demonstrated to be neuroprotective against a variety of neuronal insults, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  <cit> . moreover, lithium has been demonstrated to promote axon regeneration  <cit> . our previous study also found that lithium can reinforce the axonal regeneration of rubrospinal tract neurons in chondroitinase abc treated rats after spinal cord hemisection  <cit> . however, whether lithium can promote the regeneration of the spinal mns after ventral root avulsion is still unknown. here, we tested the effects of therapeutic lithium on the regeneration of spinal mns of bpra-injured and reimplantation-treated adult rats.

RESULTS
lithium and reimplantation effects on the motor functional recovery of the injured forepaw
the grasping test was applied to the ipsilateral  forepaws of all of the experimental rats at three days pre-lesion and from  <dig> to 20 weeks post-lesion. at 3 days pre-lesion, there was no significant difference in the grasping strength among all of the  <dig> subgroups . at the first week post-lesion, avulsion of the c <dig> and c <dig> ventral roots resulted in almost a total loss of the grasping strength in both the re and av subgroups when compared to the normal control subgroup , moreover, an equal loss of function occurred in all of the avulsion-injured subgroups . one month later, a significant increase of the grasping strength occurred accompanied by an increase in body weight in each subgroup . among the different subgroups of the rats at 4 weeks post-lesion, significant improvements in grasp strength were shown in both re subgroups when compared to those of both av subgroups . however, the average grasping strengths were still far weaker in both re subgroups compared to that of the normal subgroup . an obvious recovery of the grasping strength was demonstrated on evaluation from 10 weeks post-lesion in the av + li, re + pbs, and re + li subgroups, and the levels of the grasping strength in these  <dig> subgroups were similar to and not significantly different from that of the normal subgroup . at 10 weeks post-lesion, the grasping strength in the av + pbs subgroup was significantly lower than those of the re + li and normal subgroups . from  <dig> to 20 weeks post-lesion, the grasping strength levels of the re + li, re + pbs, and av + li subgroups were all significantly lower than that of the normal subgroup , but significantly higher than that of the av + pbs subgroup . at the end of the study, an obvious enhancement of the grasping strength appeared in the re + li subgroup, which was significantly higher than those of both the re + pbs and av + li subgroups . the most interesting result was that the grasping strength was not significantly different between the re + pbs and av + li subgroups from 10– <dig> weeks post-lesion .

gross anatomical observation
after the behavioral test, rats were euthanized, and then the spinal cord was carefully dissected to ensure that the c <dig> and c <dig> ventral roots had been completely avulsed or successfully re-implanted into the spinal cord. under a surgical microscope, we found 2– <dig> intact ventral rootlets of spinal nerves attached to the spinal cord at the anterolateral sulcus in the contralateral c <dig> or c <dig> spinal segments . for ventral root reimplantation treated rats, a nerve root was found that was closely attached to the ventrolateral surface of the ipsilateral c <dig> spinal segment and regrew into the middle trunk of the ipsilateral brachial plexus. additionally, the other reimplanted ventral root was identified as a nerve that originated from the ventral surface of the ipsilateral c <dig> spinal segment, and regenerated into the lower trunk of the ipsilateral brachial plexus . conversely, for the rats without ventral root reimplantation treatments, there was an obvious gap between the c <dig> and c <dig> spinal segments and the trunks of the brachial plexus in avulsion rats . in all animals of the present study, the c <dig> and c <dig> dorsal roots were well connected to the dorsal aspect of the c <dig> and c <dig> spinal segments, respectively.

lithium and reimplantation enhanced the survival of injured motoneurons
the survival of the injured mns was assessed by quantifying the number of chat-positive mns at 20 weeks post-lesion . in the ipsilateral ventral horns of the c <dig> spinal segments , the number of chat-positive mns  was only  <dig> % ±  <dig> % in the av + pbs subgroup , while the value increased to  <dig> % ±  <dig> % in the av + li subgroup , to  <dig> % ±  <dig> % in the re + pbs subgroup  and to  <dig> % ±  <dig> % in the re + li  subgroup. the effects of lithium and reimplantation on the survival of c <dig> mns were similar to those of the c <dig> spinal segment . the number of chat-positive mns was lowest in the av + pbs subgroup , higher in the av + li  and re + pbs subgroups , and highest in the re + li  subgroup. statistical analysis showed that the number of chat-positive mns was higher in the re + li subgroupand, in contrast, lower in the av + pbs subgroup when compared to any of the other treated subgroups . the number of chat-positive mns in both the c <dig> and c <dig> ipsilateral ventral horns was not significantly different between the av + li and re + pbs subgroups .

lithium and reimplantation promoted axon regeneration of injured motoneurons
at the end of the 20 weeks, both the dorsal and ventral roots of ipsilateral c <dig> and c <dig> spinal cord segments were removed and studied by he staining . in normal control rats, the ventral and dorsal roots of the c <dig> or c <dig> spinal cord segments were enveloped by thin root sheaths and completely separated . there were 2– <dig> rootlets in the normal c <dig> or c <dig> ventral root with well-organized axons within each rootlet . in the rats in the av + pbs  and av + li  subgroups, all of the ventral rootlets had disappeared, but the dorsal roots were unaffected. after reimplantation surgery, the ventral roots regenerated and were also completely separated from the dorsal root by the enveloping thin root sheath . in the re + pbs subgroup, approximately  <dig> ventral rootlets with regenerating axons were localized within the regenerating c <dig> or c <dig> ventral root . in the re + li subgroup , the two regenerative ventral rootlets were filled with well-organized axons, and the diameters of these axons were much larger, although the number of ventral rootlets was lower than that of the normal control.to further assess the effects of reimplantation surgery and lithium on the regrowth of regenerating axons in median nerves, toluidine blue staining was applied to semithin sections from the ipsilateral median nerve in the forepaw 40 mm distal to the reimplantation site. the result showed a large number of the myelinated axons in the normal control subgroup , but a severe loss of myelinated axons in both the av + pbs  and av + li subgroups . the high magnification of the median nerve in the avulsion series showed few myelinated fibers, with an abundance of cell debris and schwann cells . however, we found many small myelinated axons in the median nerve in the re + pbs  and re + li  subgroups. furthermore, we examined the frequency distribution of the diameter of the myelinated axons in the median nerve. in the normal controlgroup, the axon diameter distribution demonstrated a bell shape form with a left dissymmetric distribution indicating a predominance of nerve fibers with small diameters at the median nerve . in the av + pbs  and av + li  subgroups, the curves showed a more skewed distribution shape, suggesting a severe loss of nerve fibers with larger diameter, however, the axon diameter distribution showed a slight increase in the number of nerve fibers with larger diameters in the av + li subgroup . conversely in the re + pbs  and re + li  subgroups, the curves of the diameter size distribution showed higher peaks, indicating a large number of nerve fibers that covered a wider range of the larger diameters.there were 3994 ±  <dig> myelinated axons in the normal control group, but only 303 ±  <dig> in the av + pbsand 693 ±  <dig> in the av + li subgroups. the ventral root reimplantation induced substantial myelination of axons in the median nerve. the number of myelinated fibers was increased to 1225 ±  <dig> in the re + pbs and 1885 ±  <dig> in the re + li subgroups. the statistical analysis showed that the difference either between the av + pbs and the av + li or between the av + li and the re + pbs subgroups, was not significant . a higher number of myelinated fibers was found in the re + li subgroup, which was significantly higher than that of the av + pbs, av + li or re + pbs subgroups but still lower than that of the normal control group . the mean diameter of the myelinated axons measured  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm in the normal control group,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm in the re + li subgroup,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm in the re + pbs subgroup,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm in the av + li subgroup, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm in the av + pbs subgroup. differences between all subgroups were significant .

reimplantation, but not lithium, promoted motoneuron regeneration
at the end of 20 weeks, the fluoro-gold  labeled mns in the ipsilateral c <dig>  and c <dig>  ventral horns were counted and compared among different subgroups under a microscope. because the fg was injected to the median and ulnar nerves at a site approximately 20 mm ± 5 mm distal to the site where the spinal cord was cut, fg-labeled mns indicate that the retrograde tracer was taken up by the regenerating axons and transported back to the mn cytoplasm in the ipsilateral ventral horns. the quantification results showed that the number of fg-labeled mns consisted of 329 ±  <dig>  in the c <dig>  and 545 ±  <dig>  in the c <dig>  ventral horns in the normal control subgroup. avulsion resulted in a remarkable decrease in the number of fg-labeled mns and consisted of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the c <dig>  and 28 ±  <dig>  in the c <dig>  ventral horns in the av + pbs subgroup and 29 ±  <dig> in the c <dig>  and 37 ±  <dig>  in the c <dig>  ventral horns in the av + li subgroup. lithium alonedid not increase the number of fg-labeled mns because all the differences in the number of fg-labeled mns both in the c <dig> and c <dig> ipsilateral ventral horns were not significant between the av + li and av + pbs subgroups. the reimplantation surgery showed an obvious effect on the axonal regeneration of the injured mns. the number of fg-labeled mns was increased to 90 ±  <dig>  in the c <dig>  and 186 ±  <dig>  in the c <dig>  ventral horns in the re + pbs subgroup, and 111 ±  <dig>  in the c <dig>  and 180 ±  <dig>  in the c <dig>  ventral horns in the re + li subgroup. statistical analysis showed that the number of fg-labeled mns was significantly higher in the re subgroups when compared to those of the av subgroups  in eitherthe c <dig> or c <dig> spinal segments. however, no significant difference was found either between the av + li and av + pbs subgroups, or between the re + li and re + pbs subgroups , which indicated that lithium did not influence the number of fg-labeled mns at 20 weeks post-lesion.

discussion
we show here that ventral root reimplantation can protect spinal mns from death induced by avulsion injury and also elevate the number of regenerated mns, as well as facilitate growth of the regenerated axon into the median nerve and promote recovery of the grasping function. in addition, systematic administration of lithium reinforces the pro-survival effect of reimplantation surgery and induces a robust increase in the number and diameter of myelinated axons in the median nerve. moreover, we provided evidence that lithium itself can enhance the survival of injured mns and regenerate axon regrowth in the median nerve. here, we used the mn marker chat to assess the survival of the affected motor neurons. previous studies, including ours, have reported that avulsion results in a transient absence of chat protein expression inside affected mns at early post-lesion time points  <cit> . however, chat immunoreactivity was easily distinguished, although reduced, in the affected ipsilateral mns in the present study. we attribute this difference to different time points in the investigation between the previous and the present studies. previous results emphasized the early post-lesion time period , but we counted the chat-positive mns at the end of 20 weeks  post-lesion. our result was supported by the previous study which proved that the chat immunoreactive intensity inside the affected lumbar mns recovers to the normal level at 4 weeks after axonal injury  <cit> . additionally, a number of previous studies, which show no significant difference in mn counts between chat and nissl staining  <cit>  or between chat and cresyl violet staining  <cit> , support our results. therefore, the number of chat-positive mns can be used as a helpful marker for the survival of affected mnsatlate post-lesion times in axonal injuries of the peripheral nerves.

when repairing root-avulsion injuries, the survival of affected mns has been confirmed to be of ultimate importance for axonal regeneration  <cit> . our present data showed 33% to 40% of cervical mns survived up to 5 months after reimplantation, which supports the previous studies that showed ventral root reimplantation is beneficial for the survival of the affected mns  <cit> . the present data also support the idea that the surgically re-attached nerve acts as a conduit to induce the regenerative axons to regrow towards the peripheral target  <cit> . we observed a reimplanted ventral root firmly attached to the ventrolateral side of the c <dig> or c <dig> spinal cord at the proximal end connected with the ipsilateral middle or lower trunk of the brachial plexus at the distal end. in the present study, the intact c <dig> and c <dig> dorsal roots may also contribute to the repositioning of the regenerative ventral roots to the ventral root outlet area of the spinal cord and to the precise reconstruction of the ventral roots within the middle and lower trunks of the brachial plexus. according to previous studies, ventral root combined with dorsal root avulsion induces enhanced glial activation, which may occur in response to the central sensitization of nociceptive neurons at the early stage of the injury  <cit> , and enhances glial scar formation  <cit>  at the peripheral–central nervous system  transition zone at the late stage of the injury. previously, we have also shown the avulsion induced activation of astrocytes and microglia in both white and gray matter of the injured spinal cord  <cit> . therefore, we think that intact dorsal roots, compared to injured dorsal roots, may reduce unfavorable glial activation environments and facilitate the survival of the spinal mns in the present study.

in addition to reimplantation itself, lithium treatment seems to positively influence the survival of affected mns. our data showed that the number of chat-positive mns was higher in the lithium therapy group compared to the animals that only received avulsion or reimplantation. moreover, there was no significant difference between the av + li subgroup and the re + pbs subgroup in both c <dig> and c <dig> ipsilateral ventral horns. this result may imply that lithium has a neuroprotective effect by preventing neuronal death. this is in line with previous studies, for example, in primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule cells and cortical neurons, lithium robustly and potently protect against glutamate-induced, n-methyl-d-aspartate  receptor-mediated excitotoxicity  <cit> .

given that the nerve fiber diameter distribution is an important method that can contribute to insights into the processes that play a role in nerve regeneration  <cit> , the current findings suggest that reimplantation increases the number of myelinated axons and greatly ameliorates the phenotype of the lesioned nerve compared the avulsed animals. furthermore, systemic administration of lithium may reinforce the regrowth-promoting effect of reimplantation surgery on the regenerated myelinated fibers in the median nerve. we also noted that no significant difference was found when comparing the number of myelinated axons in the av + li and re + pbs subgroups, indicating that even lithium alone could protect the lesioned axon from wallerian degeneration. this result is consistent with previous reports indicating that lithium supports regeneration in the cns, including rgc axons  <cit>  and rubrospinal neurons in spinal cord  <cit> . more importantly, a recent study reported that lithium enhances remyelination of the facial and sciatic nerves  <cit> .

equally interesting is our finding that a significant return of the motor function, in the form of digit flexions, in the reimplantation animals began at 4 weeks post-lesion, compared to the avulsion series. additionally, the reimplantation plus lithium treatment group showed the highest grasp strength among all of the treated animals. this result coincided with the investigation on the spinal cord and median nerve, as well as the previous studies  <cit> . in addition, the behavioral test demonstrated that the grasping strength in avulsion injured animals treated with lithium was significantly greater than the vehicle group, and this upward trend was even maintained for 20 weeks after treatment. the rats in the two avulsion subgroups without repair surgery should not differ because there was no reimplantation to facilitate regenerating axons to grow towards the target muscle. one possible explanation for the significant effects found here could be that they result from a gradual loss of function in the av + pbs group due to gradual muscle atrophy, which is prevented in the av + li group by the li treatment. these data are consistent with a previous report that lithium induced an increase in skeletal myotube size by inhibiting gsk3β  <cit> . second, anatomical dissection of the rats confirmed that the c <dig>  c <dig> and t <dig> ventral roots make up the components of the median and ulnar nerves  <cit> , and stimulation of the median nerve produces digit flexion in the rats  <cit> . in the present study, only the c <dig> and c <dig> ventral roots were avulsed. the ventral root of t <dig> was intact, which might contribute to the grasping strength that remained in the avulsed animals. the spinal mn efferent and also the somatosensory afferent from the skin and muscles of the forepaw were proven to be very important during the grasping motor tasks  <cit> . our data showed that the ventral root avulsion did not affect the morphology of the corresponding dorsal roots, which indicates the intact c <dig> and c <dig> dorsal roots contributed to the somatosensory input of the forepaw and assisted in the functional recovery of digit grasping strength of the avulsed animals.

the combined therapeutic strategy of reimplantation and lithium in the present study resulted in an increase in the survival of the affected cervical mns, an increase in the number and diameter of median nerve fibers, and finally a better recovery of motor function in the injured forepaw when compared to the single reimplantation surgery. these findingswere supported by a number of recent studies  <cit> , which have shown the neuroprotective effect of lithium on neuronal trauma and degeneration  <cit> . although some of the clinical trials show conflicting effects of the lithium ion regarding altering the progression of cognitive and functional deficits, the results share a consensus on the view that lithium may exert long-term neuroprotective effects  <cit> . the mechanism by which lithium confers neuroprotection has been widely studied previously. lithium, as an inhibitor of gsk-3β, can reduce gsk- <dig> activity during neuronal apoptosis  <cit> . therefore, lithium might act to reduce the oxidative stress in avulsion injured mns in the present study because avulsion-induced oxidative stress has been demonstrated to be fatal to the affected mns  <cit> , and gsk <dig> has been recognized as an intermediate in oxidative stress-induced apoptotic signaling  <cit> . another important mechanism that may contribute to lithium’s effects on the affected mns in the present study might be attributed to lithium-induced bdnf activity in the central nervous system  <cit>  because many neurotrophic factors, including bdnf, have been shown to promote survival and enhance regeneration in root-avulsion injuries  <cit> . recently, we also found that lithium can enhance the expression of bdnf in npcs and increases the neuronal differentiation of npcs in the ipsilateral c <dig> ventral horns of the avulsion injured rats  <cit> . during reimplantation-induced regeneration of the mns, production of bdnf in the distal segment of the spinal nerves and the target are also thought to account for neuronal survival and regeneration  <cit> . therefore, lithium-induced bdnf production might also contribute to its effects onthe promotion of survival and enhancement of axonal regeneration in affected mns in the present study. lithium-induced activation of bcl- <dig> has also been shown to suppress glial scarring and support axon regeneration in retinal ganglion cells  <cit> . as an inhibitor of gsk <dig>  lithium induced inactivation of gsk <dig> was shown to promote axon regeneration and facilitate functional recovery after spinal cord transection injury  <cit> . our previous study also proved that lithium can facilitate chondroitinase abc  to promote the axonal regeneration of rubrospinal tract neurons in spinal cord hemisection injury  <cit> .

however, our data also showed that the number of fg-labeled mns was not significantly different between the reimplantation and reimplantation plus lithium treated animals. moreover, at a location on the median nerve 40 mm distal to the reimplantation site, the number and diameter of myelinated axons was significantly increased in the re + li group compared to the re + pbs group. one possible explanation was that the good morphological structure of regenerating myelinated axons did not guarantee a 100% functional recovery. as for the goal of fully recovering paw grasping function, although we observed regenerated axons in the median nerve in the morphological study, we believe that there is a long way to go, and much more research will be required.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, systematic administration of lithium at a therapeutic dose for 20 weeks reinforcesthe pro-survival effect of reimplantation surgery on injured mns induced by ventral root avulsion. in addition, the combined administration of lithium and reimplantation surgery promotes increases in the number and diameter of median nerve axons, as well as improves the motor functional recovery of digit flexion. the results indicate that lithium has a high potential value in surgeries that repair root-avulsion injuries in clinical settings.
