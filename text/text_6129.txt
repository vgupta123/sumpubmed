BACKGROUND
the carboxypeptidase m  is a cell membrane metalloprotease from the cpn/e regulatory family that is expressed in varying levels in most cell types  <cit> . it is believed that this enzyme plays important roles in the processing of many peptide hormones, especially during inflammation and macrophage activation  <cit> . both cpm activity and protein levels greatly increase in response to inflammatory stimuli  <cit> . additionally, cpm mediated cleavage of the c-terminal arginine from kinins change their affinity to the kinin b <dig> and b <dig> receptors, and this arginine may also be important to no production, especially in the lungs .

our group, together with others, have defined experimentally the human cpm gene organization and characterized that its promoter harbours many cis-regulatory elements responsive to inflammatory stimulus  <cit> . although the same experimental strategy has not been implemented to resolve the mouse cpm gene , it has been defined and annotated on the mouse chromosome  <dig> mainly on basis of an in silico analysis of the mouse transcriptome and genome using the nucleotide sequence data on the public databases as well as in comparison with the human cpm gene sequence.

this new approach to gene definition and genomic annotation is now feasible due to the explosion of nucleotide sequence data generated by many groups, including genome and transcriptome projects. however, most of these genome annotations and transcriptome analysis have focused on protein coding sequences and have, until recently, greatly disregarded the amount of non-protein-coding nucleotide sequences transcribed by the genomes of eukaryotes  <cit> . non-protein-coding rnas seem to account for a great portion of the transcriptome, for example:  <dig>  of the  <dig>  mouse cdnas generated by the fantom <dig> project lack any protein-coding sequence  and are annotated as non-protein coding rna   <cit> ; and more than half of the detected transcribed sequences from the human genome regions analyzed by the encode project are not observed to align with their annotated protein coding genes  <cit> . taking into consideration this new genome scenario, and in order to validate the mouse genome annotation for the cpm gene, we analysed here a number of nucleotide sequences from various public data banks that map to the mouse cpm genomic region. these sequences, which include ests and mrnas of mouse cpm genbank-unigene entry mm. <dig> and cap analysis of gene expression-tags   <cit>  are presented as supporting evidence for this gene annotation and definition, although not all of these cdnas and cage-tags have exactly the same nucleotide sequence as the proposed cpm gene. in fact, some of these mouse cpm supporting sequences in the databases have completely different nucleotide sequences. therefore, we focused in defining all possible extra transcripts of the mouse cpm locus on the basis of these cdnas and cage-tags and their annotation to the mouse cpm genomic locus. we also evaluated experimentally the mouse cpm gene structure and the expression of some of these proposed extra transcripts from mouse cpm locus, in addition to the cpm gene in selected mouse tissues.

RESULTS
bioinformatic analysis of the mouse cpm locus and its transcripts
the mouse cpm locus is located in the 10d <dig> region of the mouse chromosome  <dig>  between the mdm <dig> gene   and the annotated mrna for kinesin-related protein kifc5c , which is a possible pseudogene of the kinesin family member c <dig>  that maps to the intergenic region between the cpsf <dig>   and cpm gene at about  <dig> kb upstream from the 5'end of the cpm gene . we first designated the mouse cpm gene refseq sequence  as the mouse cpm locus transcript  <dig> . this  <dig> nucleotides long sequence is distributed in  <dig> exons in a genomic region of about  <dig> kilobases  <cit> .

in addition to the cpm gene , we defined at least  <dig> other possible mouse cpm locus transcripts  after analysing a total of  <dig> sequences that maps to this locus :  <dig> cage-tags  and  <dig> cdna sequences between mrnas and ests from the mouse cpm genbank – unigene  <cit>  entry mm. <dig> and other cdna sequences deposited in the genbank . sixteen of these  <dig> possible mcpm-ts were defined based only on cage-tag sequences , and all the information we have about them is the  <dig> to  <dig> initial nucleotides, the direction of their transcription and the source samples  <cit> . the other  <dig> mcpm-ts were defined based on at least one cdna sequence, and seven of them are based on cdnas of spliced rnas . except for the mcpm t <dig> and mcpm-t <dig>  all the other five spliced mcpm-ts are totally contained in the mcpm-t <dig> sequence , and may be incomplete cdnas from the mcpm-t <dig>  however, three of these five mcpm-ts  have cage-tags that map at their beginnings, supporting their definition as independent transcripts . the mouse cpm-t <dig> shares with mcpm-t <dig> its two initial exons but ends on a completely different third exon located on the second intron of the cpm gene. thus it is very likely that its transcription is under control of the mouse cpm gene promoter. the mcpm-t <dig> transcript, on the other hand, shares the last  <dig> exons of mcpm-t <dig>  but it begins at  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the mouse cpm gene exon  <dig> . furthermore, we have evidence that its expression is controlled by a promoter region different from that of the mouse cpm gene, as discussed later.

? = not enough information to conclude. n/a = not applicable.

the other  <dig> mcpm-ts defined here on cdna basis were all defined from the sequence of non-spliced cdnas that map to the mouse cpm locus, and half of them have only one cdna sequence that supports their definition . these non-spliced singleton sequences are very abundant in many cdna databanks and have a high chance of being artefacts such as dna contamination, unprocessed pre-mrna, cloned spliced-out intronic sequences or simply mistakes of the transcription machinery   <cit> . four of these five transcripts defined on the basis of only a singleton non-spliced cdna mapped to the anti-sense dna strand of the cpm gene .

most of these  <dig> mouse cpm locus transcripts defined here seem to be non-coding rnas. except for mcpm-t <dig>  that received a weak coding potential score, all of the spliced mcpm locus transcripts scored high on the protein coding analysis using the cpc program   <cit> . however, the high score for the majority of these transcripts may actually reflect the fact that most of their sequence is contained in the mouse cpm gene. in fact, the cpc program takes into account in the calculation of the coding potential the similarity with known protein sequences deposited in the uniref <dig> databank  <cit> , which includes the mouse cpm sequence. on the other hand, all the non-spliced mouse cpm locus transcripts scored very low in the cpc program which classified them as with no coding potential, except for mcpm-t <dig> and mcpm-t <dig>  which received a weak protein coding potential . in the case of mcpm-t <dig> this weak coding potential may also be reasoned because it contains part of the coding sequence of the cpm gene. as expected, the highest coding potential score was that of the mcpm-t <dig>  the mouse cpm gene .

finally, there are  <dig> cdnas of non-spliced rnas that map exclusively to the exon  <dig> of the cpm gene, supporting the existence of other mouse cpm locus transcripts besides the  <dig> defined above. however, because we cannot rule out that they are incomplete cdnas from some of the already defined mcpm-ts, we defined only  <dig> transcripts there based on  <dig> cage-tags that map to this genomic region . furthermore, it is still very intriguing that several independent, mainly non-coding, rna transcripts come from the sequences of the last exon of the genes  <cit> . this seems to be very frequent in genes in the so called genomic head to tail orientation, where a gene is in close proximity to opposite dna strand neighbours, and these last exons transcripts are suggested to play regulatory roles  <cit> .

experimental analysis of the mouse cpm locus transcript  <dig>  the mouse cpm gene
from the  <dig> sequences analysed, there are  <dig> cdnas whose sequences are totally included in the mouse cpm refseq nucleotides and therefore cannot be attributed to any other transcript in the locus besides the mcpm-t <dig> . the mcpm-t <dig> sequence coding for mouse cpm protein, a  <dig> amino acids polypeptide that shares about 84% similarity with the human cpm protein, begins in the second exon and extends to the beginning of the last exon – the exon  <dig> . this mcpm-t <dig> coding region was confirmed by rt-pcr, cloning and sequencing .

we also obtained for the start of transcription of mcpm-t <dig> the same initial nucleotides of the mouse cpm gene refseq sequence in race 5'experiments using an anti-sense primer directed to the beginning of the mouse cpm exon  <dig> , besides confirming the splicing junctions of exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  these 5' race experiments did not confirm a possible start of transcription  <dig> nucleotides upstream of this point, supported by  <dig> cage-tags in the sense orientation  . furthermore, none of the  <dig> cdnas analysed here were found to begin upstream of the 5'race confirmed start site. out of the  <dig> cdnas that map their beginning to the initial region of the cpm gene,  <dig> share the same start as the mouse cpm refseq sequence and the other  <dig> begin  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides downstream of this start site . however, we cannot rule out the possibility that these  <dig> cage-tags that map upstream of the mcpm-t <dig> start may actually be the beginning of the mcpm-t <dig> transcript, or that they are tissue specific, since we did not test the same tissues that originated these cage-tags nor performed 5'race experiments with mcpm-t <dig> specific primer.

there are eight classical poly-a signals located at the 3'end of the mouse cpm locus that could be used to process the 3'end of the mcpm-t <dig> mrna , which we designated poly-a signal  <dig> to  <dig>  . this genomic region extends from the mouse cpm refseq last exon into the intergenic region between the end of this exon and the end of the mdm <dig> gene last exon. we could not find any individual cdna on the genbank  <cit>  that extended through the entire sequence of the mouse cpm refseq or that extended further than the third poly-a signal cleavage site when having all the exons. this can be easily explained by the existence of adenosine rich stretches in the last exon of the mouse cpm refseq that could function as an internal annealing site to the oligo dts used in the construction of the cdna libraries  <cit> .

analysis by 3'race experiments confirmed the use of the third classical poly-a signal in this region , located at nucleotide  <dig> of the mouse cpm refseq sequence  . we also obtained in the 3'race experiments one clone of the 3'end of the possible cpm mrna that ended exactly after the fourth poly-adenosine signal  in a stretch of poly-adenosines also present in the corresponding genomic sequence beginning at nucleotide  <dig> of the cpm refseq sequence. therefore, we cannot exclude that this clone was the result of internal annealing of the oligo dt 3'race adapter to longer mrnas . in addition, we obtained by long-range rt-pcr cdna fragments that supported the use of poly-a signals  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  but we were unable to obtain fragments that evidenced the use of the two most downstream poly-a signals in the 3'end of the mouse cpm locus, pa <dig> and  <dig> .

northern blot analysis of total rna from  <dig> different mouse samples and a probe that anneals to the exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the mouse cpm mrna detected three major rnas that appear to be  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb long , which are in accordance with the use of poly-a signals  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> with the addition of a  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotide long mature poly-a tail  <cit> .

together, these results confirm the refseq sequence of the mouse cpm as the longest possible mouse cpm locus transcript, the mcpm-t <dig>  but also indicate that at least two smaller mrnas for the mouse cpm protein are transcribed from the mouse cpm gene varying mainly in the size of their 3'untranslated end.

detecting other mouse cpm locus transcripts in mouse tissues
we randomly chose to check by rt-pcr the existence of rnas from four of the possible mouse cpm locus transcripts. we defined these locus transcripts by bioinformatics analysis based on more than one cdna sequence, and they are: mcpm-t <dig>  mcpm-t <dig>  mcpm-t <dig> and mcpm-t <dig>  we were able to amplify by rt-pcrs the expected cdna fragments from all these four possible mouse cpm locus transcripts in almost all tested mouse samples, confirming their existence . we also confirmed the sequence of the rt-pcr amplicons by cloning and sequencing the dna fragments of the expected sizes obtained in previously performed experiments .

quantitative rt-pcr analysis in mouse tissues of five cpm locus transcripts
to validate the expression of mouse cpm locus transcripts  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and rule out that they were the result of transcription noise we analysed the level of expression by quantitative rt-pcr of each of these mcpm-ts and the mouse cpm gene  relative to the expression of the housekeeping gene tbp in three independent samples of  <dig> mouse adult organs, in  <dig> day embryos and placentas .

the mean relative expression evaluated by qrt-pcr of the indicated mouse cpm locus transcripts in different mouse organs and  <dig> day gestation embryo, expressed as percentage of the respective mean tbp gene expression. all values are calculated from individual values of relative expression of three animals for each sample and their coefficient of variation  is presented as percentage of the mean value.

as expected, the highest expression detected was that of the mouse cpm gene  in lungs, where it was almost three times the tbp expression .

the mcpm-t <dig> relative expression in any particular tissue or in the embryos or placentas did not differ in each of the three independent samples of the same kind, as shown by the low coefficient of variation  of the mean relative expression calculated from the results of three independent samples . this was also the case for the other four mouse cpm locus transcripts quantified, demonstrating that they possess a tissue specific level of expression that does not vary between similar individuals . these results indicate that these extra four cpm locus transcripts are not the result of transcriptional noise, since one would expect values of expression with greater variability even between the same types of samples of different animals because of the random nature of such phenomenon.

the mcpm-t <dig>  mcpm-t <dig> and mcpm-t <dig> patterns of expression in the various tissues were very similar to that of the cpm gene , which suggests that they may be part of the same transcriptional unit, and therefore be under the same transcriptional regulatory control. the only small divergence from the mouse cpm gene expression was that the expression of these mcpm-ts in spleen was comparable to their expression in kidney .

the mcpm-t <dig> and  <dig> map to intronic regions of the mouse cpm gene, and may well be processed spliced-out intronic rnas from the mouse cpm pre-mrna, which could explain the same expression pattern. these transcripts may still be functional non-coding rnas under the same transcriptional control as the cpm gene and part of the regulatory rna network  <cit> .

on the other hand, the similarity of the expression patterns of mcpm-t <dig> and the mouse cpm gene cannot be explained in the same way as the patterns of mcpm-t <dig> and mcpm-t <dig> expressions, since this non-spliced transcript includes in its sequence the entire mouse cpm gene exon  <dig> and extends at least for other  <dig> nucleotides in both introns  <dig> and  <dig> . however, we cannot rule out the possibility that the mcpm-t <dig> measured expression is in reality detection of the mouse cpm pre-mrna. further investigation is needed to exclude this possibility and validate mcpm-t <dig> as a real transcript.

the mcpm-t <dig> is the only of the four extra mouse cpm locus transcripts evaluated that is processed into a spliced rna. it is expressed in all samples tested in a much lower level than the mouse cpm gene  or the other three extra transcripts evaluated . additionally, the mcpm-t <dig> presented an expression pattern that differed considerably from the other mcpm-ts evaluated and from the mouse cpm gene , with no significant correlation . this indicates an independent control of transcription from the mouse cpm gene for this transcript, and suggests the existence of other transcriptional units in the locus.

it is also very interesting that the bioinformatic defined sequence of the mcpm-t <dig> transcript carries a coding region for a protein with  <dig> amino acids that differs only in its seven initial n-terminal amino acids from the c terminal sequence of the mouse cpm protein. this hypothetical protein, if translated from the mcpm-t <dig> rna, would include the c terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor  site and part of the catalytic domain, which would very unlikely fold in a similar way as in the full length mouse cpm protein. whether mcpm-t <dig> is an authentic coding or non-coding transcript still awaits further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
these results support the recent view that the majority of the genome sequence is transcribed, and that many of the resulting transcripts seem to be non-coding rnas exerting many different cellular functions. the existence of these extra transcripts can be deduced from the information on the transcriptomes deposited in the various public data banks, even though part of this information may actually be artefacts or transcriptional noise. however, we argue that we can still reliably use this information to find and define biological functional elements on the genome in addition to protein coding genes, but they have to be carefully experimentally validated.

the existence of multiple transcripts from the same transcriptional unit greatly enhances the possibility of genetic interactions between different genomic loci and gives support to the notion of a regulatory network based on rnas  <cit> . furthermore, our results also support the view that a specific genomic region may harbour independent transcriptional units.

the existence of both, unknown transcripts being made from a transcriptional unit of a locus or unknown independent transcriptional units in the same locus, is especially important in interpreting the results of genetic manipulations such as transgenic and knockout models as well as genetic screening studies, since the observed phenotype variation may actually be resulting from unpredicted disturbances on them. and finally, expression detection and quantification studies have to take into account the existence of extra transcripts in the same target region when designing the experiments, at the risk of obtaining misleading measurements.
