BACKGROUND
until recently, the identification of synthetic lethal interactions in human cells was based on screens using chemical libraries or on inferred synthetic lethality in model organisms such as s. cerevisiae <cit> . recent advances in rnai technology have enabled systematic screening for synthetic lethal interactions in human cells. this was done either by a traditional forward or backward genetics approach  <cit> . in forward genetics, gene knockdown effects are measured in multiple, genetically varied cancer cell lines, with synthetic lethality identified based on correlation between a specific genetic change and sensitivity to specific gene knockdown. the backward genetics approach involves the generation of a pair of isogenic cell lines with a specific genetic change and the consequent screening of both cell lines for their response to gene knockdowns. the actual screen for gene knockdown effects is performed either individually for each short hairpin rna vectors , or by pooling them together using molecular barcode techniques  <cit> . such approaches have recently been applied to identify synthetic lethal partners with central oncogenes and tumor suppressors, such as p <dig>  ras, brca, and vhl, all major regulators of cancer signaling pathways  <cit> .

the recent identification of somatic mutations in cancer that affect metabolic enzymes suggests that the concept of synthetic lethality may be successfully applied to target cancer metabolism  <cit> . such genetic mutations include the identification of two metabolic tumor suppressors in tca cycle, fumarate hydratase  and succinate dehydrogenase , and oncogene, isocitrate dehydrogenase , as well as other passenger loss-of-function mutations  <cit> . loss-of-function mutations in fh have been associated with a number of diseases including hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma , a cancer syndrome characterized by a malignant form of renal cancer  <cit> . a recent study by frezza et al. combined experimental metabolomics and computational modeling to identify a metabolic shift that occurs in fh deficient cells, characterized by a truncated tca cycle and diversion of glutamine-derived carbons into the heme biosynthesis and degradation pathway  <cit> . of note, the inhibition of this pathway selectively affected the viability of fh-deficient cells, while sparing the fh-proficient counterpart. while this represents a promising application of metabolic synthetic lethality, no high-throughput screening for synthetic lethality has been performed so far.

here, we perform a high-throughput screen for genes that are synthetic lethal with fh in a human fh-silenced embryonic kidney cell line , utilizing an rnai library targeting over  <dig>  candidate genes. our unbiased screen revealed that several genes in the heme metabolism are synthetic lethal with fh, in accordance with previous findings  <cit> . furthermore, we identified an enrichment of synthetic lethal interactions with adenylate cyclases. we validated these findings in hek293t and in fh-deficient hlrcc-patient derived cells  via both genetic and pharmacological inhibition and demonstrated that that the fh-deficient cells are characterized by an increased turnover of camp.

RESULTS
utilizing pooled rnai screen to identify synthetic lethality with fh
to identify genes that are synthetic lethal with fh, we applied an approach that combines the pooled shrna silencing of  <dig>  different genes with sirna silencing of fh in a fh-proficient embryonic kidney cell-line hek293t . hek293t cells were transduced with a library of shrna agents with an average of  <dig> agents per gene . the complete set of genes targeted by the decipher library is shown in additional file  <dig>  transduction with low viral titer  ensured a maximum of one viral integration event, and hence one gene knockdown per target cell. seven days post-transduction, cells were sub-cultured under two different conditions: one fraction of cells was transfected with sirna targeting the expression of fh and another fraction was transfected with a non-targeting control sirna. the mrna levels of fh were initially reduced to below  <dig> percent and recovered almost completely at 120 h post transfection . on the other hand, levels of fumarase, the protein encoded by fh, were found to be reduced for up to 120 h post transfection . the reduction of fumarase to levels even lower than the ones shown in figure 1c lead to cell death , since fumarase is essential for the survival of hek293t cells. consequently, we tried to avoid such low fumarase levels during the screen. finally, cells were harvested and each of the 55 k expression constructs was quantified via next-generation sequencing of associated molecular barcode tags. cells that expressed a synthetic lethal shrna with fh would consequently be depleted in the sifh pool compared to sictrl pool . we then computed the ratio of abundances of each shrna between the sifh the sictrl and pools. a complete list of shrna expression constructs together with the corresponding abundance ratios is shown in additional file  <dig>  we consider a gene as a candidate to be synthetic lethal with fh if the ratio of abundances for at least half of the shrna agents targeting the gene is lower than a threshold. in order to account for screen specific ‘noise’ levels, this threshold was computed from the standard deviation of abundance ratios obtained from twenty-one shrna agents targeting a negative control . out of the total  <dig>  genes analyzed,  <dig> candidate synthetic lethal genes were found .

next, we searched for pathways that are significantly enriched with candidate fh-synthetic lethal genes. interestingly, we found  <dig> kegg and reactome enriched pathways . among these pathways, heme metabolism and in particular hmox <dig>  fech, ugt1a <dig>  ugt2a <dig> were found to be synthetic lethal with fh, in striking accordance with previous observations by frezza et al.  <cit> . another pathway enriched with candidate synthetic lethal genes with fh is the ‘metabolism of carbohydrates’ pathway, consisting of glucose transporter slc2a <dig> and three glycolytic enzyme coding genes, taldo <dig>  eno <dig>  pklr. this pathway enrichment is consistent with an increase in glucose uptake and glycolytic flux due to fh deletion, as has previously been demonstrated  <cit> . the pathway showing the highest enrichment of synthetic lethal genes is ‘gaba b receptor activation’, consisting of four adenylate cyclase genes adcy <dig>  adcy <dig>  adcy <dig> and adcy <dig> . given these surprising findings, we decided to focus on validating the synthetic lethality with adenylate cyclase and explore the effect of fh deletion on cyclic-amp level.

genetic validation of synthetic lethality between adenylate cyclase and fh in the embryonic kidney cell line, hek293t
to gain insight into why fh-synthetic lethality was found specifically with adcy <dig>  adcy <dig>  adcy <dig> and adcy <dig> among the  <dig> known adenylate cyclase genes, we examined adenylate cyclase expression in hek293t. interestingly, we found that these four genes have the highest expression level among all adenylate cyclases, with the exception of adcy <dig> . of note, we observed that  <dig> out of  <dig> shrna constructs targeting adcy <dig> actually do show a synthetic lethal effect with fh, while the abundance of a third shrna agent is borderline significant . overall, these results suggest that the silencing of the most expressed adenylate cyclase, irrespective of their specific isoform, strongly affects the survival of fh-deficient cells.

to confirm the synthetic lethality between adenylate cyclases and fh, the two highest ranking shrnas identified by the primary screen, targeting the expression of adcy <dig>  adcy <dig>  adcy <dig> or adcy <dig>  were individually sub-cloned into the library expression vector prsi <dig> . cells were co-transduced with lentiviruses containing shadcy expression constructs as well as a shrna expression construct targeting fh. at 6 days post transduction, expression levels of fh as well as of adenylate cyclases, and cell viability of the cells were determined relative to control cells. two shrnas targeting the expression of adcy <dig> as well as one shrna targeting each adcy <dig> and adcy <dig> were confirmed to be synthetic lethal with fh in hek293t cells . in all cases, the shrna targeting led to approximately  <dig> percent reduction in gene expression levels .

genetic and pharmacological validation of synthetic lethality between adenylate cyclases and fh in the hlrcc-patient derived cell line uok262
to further validate synthetic lethality between adenylate cyclase and fh, we used tumor cells harboring a germline mutation in fh, the uok <dig> renal tumor cells, a metastatic cell line derived from an hlrcc patient  <cit> . of note, these cells are devoid of any fh activity and show similar metabolic features to fh1-deficient mouse cells  <cit> . specifically, we silenced adcy <dig>  adcy <dig>  adcy <dig> and adcy <dig> expression and measured colony formation both in uok <dig> and in an isogenic cell line in which fh was reintroduced   <cit> . of note, we found that adcy <dig>  adcy <dig> and adcy <dig>  but not adcy <dig> were synthetic lethal with fh . since these results are in partial agreement with our findings in fh-deficient hek293t cells, we analyzed adenylate cyclase expression data measured by qpcr in uok cells. interestingly, we found that adcy <dig>  adcy <dig>  and adcy <dig> are the most abundant adenylate cyclase in uok <dig> cells, while adcy <dig> is very poorly expressed in these cells. these results strongly suggest that targeting the most abundant adenylate cyclases is again sufficient to affect cell viability of fh-deficient cells .

next, we wanted to confirm synthetic lethality between adenylate cyclases and fh using a pharmacological approach. to this end, we tested the effects of the adenylate cyclase inhibitor mdl- <dig> a on the uok <dig> cell lines. both cell lines were treated with increasing concentrations of  <dig> ,  <dig> and 5 μm mdl- <dig> a for 7 days, after which colonies were counted . it was found that uok <dig> cells were more sensitive to this adenylate cyclase inhibitor than their fh reconstituted uok262pfh counterparts. particularly, at a concentration of 1 μm mdl- <dig> a we found that uok <dig> cells formed less than half as many colonies as uok262pfh cells .

cyclic-amp production is increased following fh deletion and supported by a drop in nucleotide phosphodiester expression
the synthetic lethality between adenylate cyclase and fh suggests that cyclic-amp  mediated signaling pathways may play an important role in the survival of fh-deficient cells. therefore, we investigated the possibility that camp homeostasis is deregulated in these cells by measuring camp levels in uok <dig>  our analysis revealed that steady-state levels of camp are maintained very low in both fh-deficient and proficient cell lines . nevertheless, when cells were stimulated with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin alone or in combination with the pan-inhibitor of phosphodiesterases  ibmx, the capacity for cyclic-amp production of uok <dig> cells was higher than that of uok262pfh, suggesting a higher camp turnover in fh-deficient cells. notably though, these results may be biased due to the existence of distinct camp pools of mitochondria and cytoplasm  <cit> .

to examine the mechanism that leads to an increased camp turnover in the fh deficient cells, we analyzed the expression of adenylate cyclase and camp phosphodiesterase  genes in uok <dig> and uok262pfh cells using gene set enrichment analysis   <cit> . we found that while there is no significant change in adenylate cyclase gene expression following fh deletion, the expression of camp phosphodiesterase genes significantly drops following fh deletion . to further evaluate the potential importance of camp phosphodiesterase for increasing camp production, we reexamined the effect of pdes knockdowns in the synthetic lethality screen. importantly, we found that the knockdown of  <dig> out of  <dig> camp phosphodiesterase  showed a synthetic rescue effect, representing a significant enrichment of pdes as fh-synthetic rescue genes . hence, the knockdown of either pde1b or pde7a leads to a higher growth rate when fh is silenced. synthetic rescue is defined analogously to synthetic lethality, requiring that the ratio of abundances in the sifh versus the sictrl pools of at least half of the shrna agents targeting the gene are significantly high .

discussion
in this study we performed a high-throughput screen for identifying synthetic lethal genes with the tumor suppressor fh, whose loss of function is associated with the development of renal cancer, with the aim of finding novel therapeutic targets for this deadly disease. the method was applied on the fh-proficient embryonic kidney cell line, hek293t, and involved the double knockdown of genes via a library of shrna constructs and by means of the direct silencing of fh via sirna. identified synthetic lethality in hek293t between fh and adenylate cyclases was shown to be transferable to fh-deficient hlrcc-patient derived cells . notably, the screen was not carried out in uok <dig> cells, which represent a more direct model of hlrcc, because uok <dig> and uok262pfh substantially differ in terms of proliferation speed, transducibility, knockdown efficiency, and knockdown kinetics, which would have influenced the interpretation of the screen results. instead, hek293t is a more appropriate cell line for such screens since it can be easily and effectively transfected and transduced and shows negligible proliferation defects upon acute, partial silencing of fh. inducing a stronger and more permanent knockdown or even knockout of fh might have yielded different screening results. however, this approach would have required the identification of a fh-proficient cell line that tolerates such strong reduction of fh levels for the duration of the screen . moreover, the partial reduction of fh levels used for this screen, which resulted in only mild proliferation defects in hek293t cells, allowed us to analyze synthetic lethal interactions over a large dynamic range. in other words, if strong inhibition of fh by itself would result in severely reduced viability, it would be hard to identify genes whose inhibition in combination with fh reduces viability even further, as required for the identification of synthetic lethal interactions.

besides confirming the crucial role of the heme biosynthesis pathway in fh-deficient cells, this screen revealed an unexpected result, i.e. synthetic lethality with camp signaling pathway. these findings prompted us to further investigate the link between fh and camp biosynthesis. although this link has never been established before in eukaryotes, fh expression is closely associated with camp signaling in e. coli, indicating an interesting crosstalk between these two pathways  <cit> . our results suggest that fh-deficient cells have a higher turnover of camp, which might underline the addiction to camp-activated protein kinases -associated oncogenic pathways. indeed, pkas are known to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and have previously been shown to participate in the onset and progression of various cancers  <cit> . furthermore, camp has previously been shown to induce ho- <dig>  the limiting step of the heme biosynthesis and degradation pathway  <cit> . therefore, it can be speculated that increased camp could also serve to support the expression of ho- <dig>  <cit> , which is essential for the survival of fh deficient cells  <cit> , as also found in our synthetic lethality screen. another hypothesis is that fh deficiency lowers oxidative tca cycle activity and hence co <dig> and bicarbonate levels, while bicarbonate is known to activate specific adenylate cyclases  <cit> . the down-regulation of bicarbonate-activated adenylate cycles may potentially render the activity of other adenylate cyclases essential for survival. this hypothesis regarding lower bicarbonate levels in fh deficient cells is supported by a recent study showing increased dependence of fh deficient cells on reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived alpha-ketoglutarate via isocitrate dehydrogenase  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest adenylate cyclase as a new potential target for treating hlrcc patients, while the specific mechanism which renders it essential for the survival of fh-deficient cells remains an open question.
