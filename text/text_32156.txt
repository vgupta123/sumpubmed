BACKGROUND
neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes in human blood. they are essential for innate immunity and are the first cells to be recruited for defence against invading microorganisms at sites of infection  <cit> . neutrophils are continuously produced in the bone marrow through a tightly regulated process termed granulopoiesis. different types of granules loaded with microbicidal proteins appear at different stages of neutrophil differentiation, which is defined by six morphologically distinguishable cellular stages of maturation. the first morphologically identified precursor committed to the neutrophil lineage is the myeloblast. myeloblasts mature into promyelocytes, in which formation of primary granules containing myeloperoxidase  takes place, and further to myelocytes where secondary granules are formed. proliferation ceases as differentiation proceeds via the metamyelocyte, the band cell, and ultimately the mature segmented neutrophil, which is the cell released to blood. granulopoiesis is strictly regulated by transcription factors including runx <dig>  c/ebpα, and c/ebpε .

micrornas  are small, non-coding rnas that negatively regulate gene expression on a post-transcriptional level by binding to target mrnas, thereby altering translation of the transcripts or their stability. target recognition is mediated through base-pairing of the mirna with its target mrna, usually between a 6– <dig> nucleotide seed sequence situated within residues 2– <dig> of the mirna and a mirna recognition element  in the 3′ untranslated region  of the mrna  <cit> . the resulting changes in protein expression affect widespread cellular processes including development, differentiation, proliferation, survival, and immune responses  <cit> . alterations in mirna levels have been associated with numerous diseases and are implicated in the initiation and progression of human cancers including leukemias  <cit> .

we recently demonstrated that mirnas are regulators of proteins essential for granulopoiesis . we showed that mir-130a suppresses expression of smad <dig> and thereby reduces sensitivity to tgf-β1-induced growth inhibition  <cit> . mir-130a also represses appropriate cell cycle exit and secondary granule protein expression by targeting c/ebpε in neutrophil precursors  <cit> . these two targets for mir-130a were suggested by in silico prediction algorithms based on conservation across species, sequence complementarity, and other mirna–mrna binding properties  <cit> . this is an often-used approach to identify putative targets of mirnas. however, many predicted targets are false positives, and several factors that may influence the effect of the mirna on the mrna are not taken into consideration  <cit> . these include tissue specificity, expression levels of both rna molecules, and the surrounding regulatory mechanisms particular to the cell of interest  <cit> . more direct methods used for finding mirna targets include identification of changes in mrna transcript levels induced by altered mirna expression and immunoprecipitation of mirna–mrna complexes . however, these methods do not account for the actual reduction in protein levels seen in a particular cell type in response to changes in expression of an endogenous mirna. protein turnover times vary, and repression of gene expression by mirnas can occur solely through translational inhibition, altering only the amount of protein being produced and not the amount of mrna  <cit> . immunoblotting is frequently used to determine the effect of mirna-mediated reduction on synthesis of selected proteins. as an alternative for a more extensive, global characterization of the effects of mirna modulations on protein expression, stable isotope labelling of amino acids in cell culture  and mass spectrometry  may be used as originally shown  <cit>  and applied to the neutrophil proteome in a murine model  <cit> . further developments of the approach include pulsed silac , in which only newly synthesized proteins are labelled as shown in the analysis of around  <dig> proteins in hela cells  <cit> .

here, we used psilac-based ms to investigate the effects of mir-130a on the neutrophil proteome using two myeloblast-derived cell lines: murine 32dcl <dig> cells and human kasumi- <dig> cells. mir-130a is highly expressed in early neutrophil precursors  compared to more mature precursors  <cit> . we demonstrate that inhibition of mir-130a with an anti-mir-130a oligonucleotide in a mir-130a-overexpressing 32dcl <dig> clone and in kasumi- <dig> cells results in significant changes in the levels of  <dig> out of  <dig> proteins and  <dig> out of  <dig> proteins, respectively. we found that putative mir-130a target proteins are more induced than the remaining proteins quantified in the 32dcl <dig> mir-130a clone following mir-130a inhibition. three significantly induced proteins, nuclear transcription factor y, gamma , isochorismatase domain containing  <dig> , and catalase , are putative mir-130a targets with good scores in rain  . finally, we constructed mir-130a target protein networks including the proteins identified in this study in order to find pathways affected by mir-130a in the context of neutrophil development. we identified important myeloid regulatory proteins, such as myb and core-binding factor beta , as putative direct mir-130a targets.

methods
cell culture, transfection, and psilac labelling
the sequences of murine and human mir-130a-3p  are identical. the murine myeloblast-derived cell line 32dcl <dig>  was stably transfected with the expression plasmid pegp-mir-130a  as described previously  <cit> . this 32dcl <dig> mir-130a clone was cultured in silac medium consisting of rpmi medium without arginine, lysine, and glutamine , 10 % dialysed fbs ,  <dig> u/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin , 1 ng/ml murine il- <dig> , 1 % glutamax™- <dig> , and  <dig>  mg/ml proline  to avoid arginine-to-proline conversion  <cit> . either naturally occurring isotopes of lysine and arginine ),  <dig> , <dig> -d4-lysine and 13c6-arginine ), or 13c <dig> n2-lysine and 13c <dig> n4-arginine ) were added to the medium at a concentration of  <dig>  mg/l for lysine and 28 mg/l for arginine.

for psilac, the 32dcl <dig> mir-130a clone was grown in silac l medium for six days and subsequently washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline  to eliminate traces of l amino acids. cells  were then transfected with anti–mir-130a-lna or scrambled-lna  through electroporation using the amaxa nucleofection system  according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and transferred to m  or h  medium for approximately 48 h. similarly, kasumi- <dig> cells  were grown in normal medium , 20 % fbs ,  <dig> u/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin ), washed twice with pbs before transfection  with anti–mir-130a-lna or scrambled-lna  and switched to m or h silac medium, respectively, for approximately 72 h. the silac medium used for kasumi- <dig> cells was identical to the 32dcl <dig> silac medium except 20 % dialysed fbs was used and no il- <dig> was added.

rna and protein extraction and quantification
kasumi- <dig> cells were centrifuged on a histopaque  <dig>  gradient  to remove dead cells. both cell lines were washed twice in pbs and counted with an automatic cell counter . viability was evaluated using trypan blue  exclusion. total rna was extracted from cells from each condition with the purelink rna mini kit  according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. m and h conditions were combined 1: <dig> based on cell counts. for protein extraction, cell combinations were lysed in preheated, non-reducing 2x laemmli sample buffer  supplemented with complete mini protease inhibitor cocktail  and boiled for 10 min. protein concentration was measured using the pierce bca protein assay kit .

cdna synthesis and mirna detection
reverse transcription of mirna to first-strand cdna was performed using the primers mir-130a  with sno <dig>  and rnu6b  as internal normalizers in 32dcl <dig> and kasumi- <dig> cells, respectively. real-time pcr was performed in triplicate using taqman microrna assays   for mir-130a  with sno <dig>  and rnu6b  as controls on a 3000-p real-time pcr machine .

in-solution digestion
from the cell lysate, 50 μg of protein were precipitated using trichloroacetic acid/acetone followed by protein re-solubilization in 10 μl 8 m urea, 50 mm nh4hco <dig>  the re-solubilized protein was subsequently reduced by incubation with dithiothreitol  followed by alkylation with iodoacetamide . the alkylated proteins were next pre-digested for three hours using endo-lys c  before dilution to a final concentration of 2 m urea and continued digestion overnight at room temperature using trypsin . peptides were then depleted for sds using pierce detergent removal spin columns  before offgel peptide fractionation.

offgel peptide fractionation
tryptic peptides were fractionated according to their isoelectric points into  <dig> fractions by offgel fractionation on a 13 cm immobilized ph gradient strip  using a  <dig> offgel separator . fractions were collected into eppendorf tubes and dried down to a final volume of 20 μl using a vacuum concentrator  before freezing or further processing.

peptide desalting using stagetips
concentrated offgel fractions were diluted with 5 % formic acid and desalted on a pre-equilibrated homemade stagetip essentially as described previously  <cit> . the desalted peptides were then incubated in a vacuum concentrator  to almost complete dryness for methanol removal and then re-dissolved into 20 μl 5 % formic acid and transferred to a glass vial for further analysis by ms.

peptide analysis by lc-ms/ms
five microliters of the desalted offgel peptide fractions were loaded on an acclaim pepmap <dig> c <dig> precolumn . proteins were separated using an easy-spray pepmap <dig> c <dig> analytical column with integrated emitter  on a 90-min gradient controlled by an easy-nlc ii . the column was connected to an ltq orbitrap xl mass spectrometer  equipped with an easy-spray nano-electrospray source . the flow rate was 200 nl/minute; the mobile phases consisted of solvent a  and solvent b . the gradient went from 0 % to 45 % solvent b in 80 min, followed by 10 min with 100 % solvent b; then data acquisition was stopped and the column was re-equilibrated with solvent a. ms data were acquired recording full scan spectra  in the orbitrap with  <dig>  resolution at 400 m/z. ms/ms data were recorded in parallel in a data-dependent mode, fragmenting the  <dig> most abundant ions  by collision-induced dissociation in the ltq ion trap at 35 % collision energy. ms/ms spectra were recorded using dynamic exclusion  to minimize repeated fragmentation of the same peptides.

data analysis using maxquant
recorded raw files were analysed using maxquant version  <dig> . <dig>   <cit>  for peptide quantitation by ms1-intensity and for protein identification using the andromeda search engine  <cit>  with the following settings: fasta-files: homo_sapiens.grch <dig> .pep.all.fasta  or mus_musculus.grcm <dig> .pep.all.fasta . variable modifications: oxidation , acetyl , fixed modifications: carbamidomethyl . labels: arg <dig> & lys <dig> as medium-labelled and arg <dig> & lys <dig> as heavy-labelled amino acids. peptide false discovery rate : 1 %. protein fdr: 1 %. match between runs: 2 min. keep low-scoring version of identified peptides: on. all other settings were left at their defaults.

data analysis of proteins identified by lc-ms/ms
significantly regulated proteins were determined by performing a significance b test  <cit>  with a window size of  <dig> and step size of  <dig> proteins . assigned p-values were corrected for multiple testing using the benjamini–hochberg procedure  <cit> . proteins with a resulting corrected p-value  < <dig>  were deemed significantly regulated. each protein was assigned a human readable hgnc  or mgi  symbol via ensembl biomart version  <dig>   <cit> .

each protein was assigned a mir-130a association probability by mapping to rain  via the string  <dig> alias file. for mirna target identification, rain incorporates experimentally supported interactions , mirna and mrna co-occurrence-based text mining of medline abstracts  <cit> , as well as processed mirna target predictions from the prediction algorithms targetscan  <cit> , pictar  <cit> , miranda  <cit> , and starmirdb  <cit> . based on these inputs, the program assigns association probabilities to potential targets of a given mirna according to the combined level of confidence of the mirna–mrna interaction. rain obtains all protein–protein interactions from string  <cit> .

the proteins identified in ms were compared with the top 20 % best scoring rain association probabilities for mir-130a to a) find potential mir-130a targets among the quantified proteins for the two cell lines, and to b) identify potential mir-130a target proteins for the mir-130a association network that might associate with proteins within the regulated protein subset found for the 32dcl <dig> mir-130a clone. cytoscape  <cit>  was used to visualize this network. the david tool  <cit>  was used to identify enriched gene ontology terms for cellular components, and the ingenuity pathway analysis software  was used to identify enriched ‘molecular and cellular functions’ among regulated proteins compared to the remaining quantified proteins within the same experiment.

RESULTS
mir-130a expression in the 32dcl <dig> and kasumi- <dig> cell lines
our aim was to evaluate the effect of mir-130a on the proteome at the time of neutrophil maturation when mir-130a expression is at its peak   <cit> . we therefore chose a murine and a human cell line both representing immature neutrophil precursors. the murine myeloblast-derived cell line 32dcl <dig> was stably transfected with a mir-130a-expressing plasmid, resulting in a clone over-expressing mir-130a. this has previously been shown to be a good model for investigating the effect of mir-130a on specific target proteins  <cit> . the kasumi- <dig> cell line is derived from an acute myeloid leukemia patient with t chromosomal translocation and has a  <dig> -fold higher endogenous expression of mir-130a than the level found in primary myeloblasts and promyelocytes isolated from normal human bone marrow  <cit> .

psilac approach for identification of myeloid mir-130a target proteins
we transiently transfected the 32dcl <dig> mir-130a clone and kasumi- <dig> cells with an inhibitory lna probe against mir-130a  or a scrambled-lna . the cells were then transferred to medium-heavy  and heavy  medium, respectively, and pulsed for approximately 48 h  or 72 h . at this point, the effect of mir-130a is reflected by differences between m and h proteins while light  proteins have all been synthesized prior to interference with the free mir-130a pool. subsequently, cells from each condition were combined in equal amounts, lysed, and prepared for analysis on the ltq orbitrap xl mass spectrometer after extensive fractionation as described in methods. the experimental setup is outlined in fig.  <dig>  the free pool of mir-130a at the time of harvest was measured using real-time pcr and indicates the different levels in the anti-mir-130a-lna and scrambled-lna conditions .fig.  <dig> experimental setup of the psilac method. a cells grown in l medium were transfected with anti-mir-130a-lna or scrambled-lna  and transferred to m or h silac-medium, respectively. after 48 h  or 72 h  of pulse labelling, cells were washed, combined 1: <dig>  and lysed. samples were prepared for and analysed by lc-ms/ms, producing peptide peaks as shown . the light peptides were disregarded while the m and h peptides were compared, generating m/h ratios for further analysis



impact of mir-130a on protein output
for the 32dcl <dig> mir-130a clone, we identified a total of  <dig> proteins present both in the m and h condition and their ratios could be quantified. for the kasumi- <dig> cells, this number was  <dig> proteins, possibly reflecting the slower growth and incorporation of new amino acids in these cells. additional file  <dig> lists the complete sets of quantified proteins and related parameters, and fig.  <dig> shows the intensities in ms as a function of log <dig> fold changes in protein expression. proteins differentially regulated by mir-130a were determined based on statistical significance rather than a fold change cut-off. in this manner, differences in noise at different levels of intensities within the ms analysis were taken into consideration. moreover, the effect of mirnas can be rather subtle  <cit>  and might not amount to e.g. a two-fold change in target protein levels. after correction for multiple testing, we identified  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated proteins in the 32dcl <dig> mir-130a clone, and  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated proteins in kasumi- <dig> cells, following mir-130a inhibition .fig.  <dig> the intensities in ms as a function of log <dig> fold changes in protein expression between the anti–mir-130a-lna and scrambled-lna conditions for the 32dcl <dig> mir-130a clone  and the kasumi- <dig> cells . proteins are represented by crosses  or dots . colours represent significance according to the significance b test . significantly regulated proteins with q <  <dig>  and top 20 % mir-130a association probabilities are given by name



biological characteristics of neutrophil mir-130a-regulated proteins
we investigated the biological characteristics of the regulated protein subset in the 32dcl <dig> mir-130a clone. lysosomes and peroxisomes were found by david to be enriched cellular components in the regulated subset compared to all quantified proteins. using the ingenuity pathway analysis software, we also found that ‘cellular development’ and ‘cellular growth and proliferation’ were the two most enriched ‘molecular and cellular functions’ in the regulated subset compared to the remaining quantified proteins. this corresponds well with observed effects of mir-130a on proliferation and cell cycle in immature neutrophil cells  <cit> .

identification of mir-130a targets in the neutrophil proteome
the standard way to validate the impact of a mirna in a proteomics study is to search for an enrichment of matches to the mirna seed sequence within the 3′ utrs of the mrnas encoding proteins found to be regulated within the experiment  <cit> . however, several other aspects of the mirnas and of their target mrnas are involved in their interaction, including mrna accessibility and complementarity between the remaining mirna sequence and the mrna target  <cit> . different in silico mirna target prediction algorithms take these and other aspects into consideration to various extents, resulting in algorithms with distinct specificity and sensitivity and, consequently, varying reliability in their identification of potential mirna targets  <cit> . while the seed sequence is commonly accepted as being an indispensable part of the interaction mechanism  <cit> , its presence alone grossly overestimates the number of targets for a given mirna  <cit> . we therefore used a novel tool, rain , to identify potential direct mir-130a targets among the proteins found within our two studies . as most of the associations come from prediction algorithms, we chose the top 20 % highest scoring associations, which consist of  <dig> predictions,  <dig> experiments, and  <dig> text-mining interactions for mir-130a in mice.

first, we used rain to determine whether changes in protein levels could be directly attributed to the inhibition of mir-130a. we compared the fold changes of potential mir-130a target proteins with a good rain score  to those of proteins without scores . we found potential targets to be more up-regulated after mir-130a inhibition for the 32dcl <dig> mir-130a clone  as demonstrated by the right shift of the curve showing higher m/h ratios. the effect was not present for the kasumi- <dig> cells . this confirms that there is an overall greater effect of inhibiting mir-130a in cells from the 32dcl <dig> mir-130a clone where the free mir-130a pool is much more reduced  than in the kasumi- <dig> cell line  upon lna-mediated inhibition .fig.  <dig> the cumulative distributions of m/h ratios of proteins with good rain scores , all remaining proteins , and proteins without rain scores  as a function of log <dig> m/h fold changes in protein expression between the anti-mir-130a-lna  and scrambled-lna  conditions for the 32dcl <dig> mir-130a clone. a kolmogorov-smirnov test of equality between distributions results in the following: p-value =  <dig>  for the comparison between m/h ratios of proteins with good rain scores and the m/h ratios of proteins without scores; p-value =  <dig>  for the m/h ratios of proteins with good rain scores and the m/h ratios of all remaining proteins



secondly, we used rain to determine potential mir-130a targets within the subsets of significantly regulated proteins. three derepressed proteins  with mir-130a association probabilities within the top 20 % were found in the 32dcl <dig> mir-130a clone and one  in kasumi- <dig> cells , indicating that most of the de-regulated proteins are either indirectly regulated by mir-130a or bona fide mir-130a targets not found by rain.

in ms experiments, such as the one described here, typically only a minor fraction of the proteins present in the cell is detected  <cit> . the number is further limited by the requirement for detection of both m and h proteins to identify ratios between conditions. this may also explain the fact that the subsets of significantly regulated proteins did not overlap between the two cell lines. proteins in the regulated subset in one cell line identified for both the h and m condition among non-significantly regulated proteins in the other cell line are listed in additional file 5: table s <dig> 

in ms the capacity to detect proteins of low abundance, such as transcription factors and other regulatory proteins, is limited in samples with a high dynamic range . in contrast, mirnas favour transcription factors, which are generally expressed at relatively low levels in the cell  <cit> , as targets  <cit> . c/ebpε is not expressed in 32dcl <dig> or kasumi- <dig> cells , and smad <dig> was not identified in either cell line. consequently, a small change in the protein level of, for example, a transcription factor may have a greater and thus detectable downstream effect. together runx <dig> and cbf-β constitute an important heterodimeric, myeloid transcription factor. cbf-β is a highly predicted mir-130a target . cbf-β is up-regulated  <dig> -fold  in the 32dcl <dig> mir-130a clone following mir-130a inhibition and a candidate upstream regulator of three proteins within the regulated subset: mpo, il-2ra  and proteinase  <dig> . of these three only mpo and prtn <dig> were identified in the kasumi- <dig> experiment, and only prtn <dig> was borderline significantly up-regulated , probably reflecting the greater degree of mir-130a inhibition by anti-mir-130a-lna observed in the 32dcl <dig> mir-130a clone .

to identify additional potential regulatory networks involving mir-130a, we constructed association networks for the subset of  <dig> regulated proteins found for the 32dcl <dig> mir-130a clone. other proteins that interact with this protein subset with protein-protein association probabilities above  <dig>  and which have mir-130a association probabilities within the top 20 % were also included. this resulted in a major mir-130a network as well as several minor, disconnected networks . the major mir-130a network includes the transcriptional activator myb, which is more highly expressed in early neutrophil precursors compared to more mature cells  <cit> . myb is a predicted mir-130a target but was not identified in either cell line. if myb is up-regulated following inhibition of mir-130a, this could lead to the observed increases of its targets, the primary granule proteins mpo  <cit>  and prtn <dig>  <cit>  . therefore, both cbf-β and myb are potential direct mir-130a targets worth investigating further. cbf-β, myb, and mir-130a are co-expressed in early myeloid precursors, suggesting that mir-130a may have a buffer effect on their protein levels .fig.  <dig> rain networks of potential mir-130a targets  and differentially regulated proteins identified for the 32dcl <dig> mir-130a clone following mir-130a inhibition. only proteins with string association probabilities above  <dig>  and interactions with significantly regulated proteins are included. square: predicted target . oval: not predicted. bold outline: in dataset and significant. thin outline: in dataset but not significant. no outline and blue: not in dataset. red: up-regulated > <dig>   upon mir-130a inhibition. green: down-regulated < − <dig>   upon mir-130a inhibition. grey: regulated less than  <dig>  . these fold changes are included in the network to also indicate the observed direction of strongly predicted targets quantified but not significantly regulated within the data set



in murine cells, rain does not identify smad <dig> as a mir-130a target. targetscan identifies smad <dig> as a human mir-130a target with two seed matches  in the smad <dig> 3′ utr. the same mres are also found in the murine smad <dig> 3′ utr, but presumably other factors of the targetscan algorithm prevent its prediction of murine smad <dig> as a mir-130a target since murine and human mir-130a are identical. we have previously experimentally identified smad <dig> as a direct mir-130a target in murine cells  <cit> . however, medline abstracts and experimental databases in rain only include murine targets if it is explicitly stated that they are derived from experiments with murine cells. therefore, it cannot be excluded that certain interesting mir-130a targets will be missed using rain due to this restriction in the underlying databases. rain does identify a weak interaction, although below the network cut-off, between smad <dig> and nfyc, which is significantly up-regulated upon mir-130a inhibition. nfyc is a predicted mir-130a target, but the effect of mir-130a might also be mediated by smad <dig> or one of its other associated network proteins such as its heterotrimeric transcription factor complex partner nfya. this complex plays an important role in cell cycle progression  <cit>  and may thus be regulated in neutrophil precursors by mir-130a targeting two of its subunits.

not much is known about isoc <dig>  also significantly derepressed by mir-130a inhibition and a highly predicted mir-130a target, other than that it associates with peroxisomes, has enzymatic activity, and may promote cell growth  <cit> . the last mir-130a target with a good rain score and significantly derepressed protein in the 32dcl <dig> mir-130a clone is cat. cat is also usually located within peroxisomes and catalyses hydrogen peroxide degradation  <cit> . the significantly down-regulated smarcb <dig> associates with smarcd <dig>  which is a predicted mir-130a target and down-regulated, although not significantly, in this study. these proteins form parts of swi/snf complexes, which regulate gene expression through chromatin remodelling  <cit> . this indicates that, in addition to transcription factors, mir-130a may target other types of transcriptional regulators as well as metabolic processes in neutrophil precursors. in summary, these and other interactions identified here can form the basis for further experimental identification of mir-130a regulation in neutrophil development extending further than just single mir-130a–mrna interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified subsets of the murine and human neutrophil proteomes significantly regulated by mir-130a, which likely represent a mixture of direct targets, including nfyc, isoc <dig>  and cat, and mainly indirect mir-130a targets. we demonstrated that substantial inhibition of mir-130a affects the overall expression of predicted target proteins in the murine neutrophil model system. we identified common biological features of the significantly regulated murine protein subset. combining the significantly regulated murine protein subset with high-scoring putative mir-130a targets from the rain database in an interaction network, we identified subsets of proteins with potential roles in downstream mir-130a regulation relevant for further experimental investigation. based on these analyses, we identified myb and cbf-β as putative direct mir-130a targets and potential regulators of the primary granule proteins mpo and prtn <dig> following mir-130a inhibition in the 32dcl <dig> mir-130a clone. together, these results provide significant insight into multiple mir-130a-regulated proteins and emphasize its important regulatory role in neutrophil development.
