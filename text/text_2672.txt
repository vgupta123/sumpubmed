BACKGROUND
amphetamines are central nervous system stimulants. they are among the most commonly abused illicit drugs after cannabis  <cit> . mounting evidence shows that illicit users expose themselves to substantial risk of brain injury in frontal and subcortical regions. blood perfusion abnormalities are well established  <cit> . metabolic abnormalities are widely reported, including reduction in dopamine transporters in the striatum  <cit>  and prefrontal cortex  <cit> ; reduced levels of neuronal markers  in frontal white matter and increased myo-inositol and choline-containing compounds in frontal grey matter  <cit> ; and altered cerebral glucose metabolism  <cit> . a recent review of evidence for structural brain abnormalities in illicit amphetamine users reported white matter abnormalities including volume reductions, disturbed fractional anisotropy measures, and increased deep and periventricular white matter hyperintensities   <cit> . these findings were echoed in a later publication which again found lower fractional anisotropy in right frontal white matter and other white matter disturbances in the basal ganglia of methamphetamine using patients using diffusion tensor imaging  <cit> .

the combination of perfusion, metabolic, and white matter abnormalities provide biological mechanisms which could potentially result in primary and/or secondary detrimental effects on cortical grey matter. metabolic abnormalities may lead to apoptosis, or loss of glial cell volume with concurrent reduction in cortical thickness. infarcts arising from blood perfusion defects could result in cortical tissue loss through wallerian degeneration. the lower fractional anisotropy noted by  <cit>  was interpreted as evidence for axonal injury. it has been observed in alzheimers patients that blood perfusion abnormalities are evident before cortical loss  <cit> . the hawaii aging with hiv cohort study has provided evidence linking wmhs with cortical atrophy  <cit> .

behavioral evidence also suggests that amphetamine usage is associated with abnormalities in frontal regions. one characteristic of addictive behavior is preference for small immediate rewards over larger but delayed rewards. a comparison of  <dig> recently abstinent methamphetamine using subjects with  <dig> healthy controls found that the patients showed less activation than controls in the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and subcortical regions in a choice of reward task  <cit> . addiction can also be characterized by deficit in behavior control and/or modification. a study comparing  <dig> methamphetamine dependent patients with  <dig> healthy controls found that the patients exhibited reduced activation in the right prefrontal cortex during a behavior control task  <cit> . neither study, however, was able to elucidate if the observed cognitive and neural activation differences were a predisposing factor or a consequence of the addictive behavior.

yet evidence of amphetamine related cortical grey matter damage in the substance dependant population remains equivocal. berman et al.'s  review  <cit>  listed cortical grey matter results from four studies: two compared methamphetamine using and control subjects, two were polydrug studies which included methamphetamine users. the first methamphetamine study used cortical surface maps to compare localized grey matter density estimates in  <dig> methamphetamine using subjects compared to  <dig> healthy controls. it found reductions in the cingulate, limbic, and paralimbic cortices, but not in the lateral cortical surfaces  <cit> . the second employed voxel-based morphometry to compare grey matter density in  <dig> methamphetamine using subjects compared to  <dig> healthy controls. it reported reduced grey matter density in the right middle frontal gyrus  <cit> . one polydrug study compared manually traced regions of interest in  <dig> methamphetamine using,  <dig> cocaine using, and  <dig> control subjects. it reported smaller temporal grey matter volumes in both amphetamine and cocaine using compared to control men, with no overall difference between the stimulant using groups in the estimated grey matter volumes  <cit> . the other investigated  <dig> intravenous drug users, nine of whom abused methamphetamine along with other drugs, and found no reductions in either whole brain or frontal lobe grey matter volumes compared to  <dig> matched controls, though white matter reductions were noticed in both patient groups  <cit> .

none of the studies in the review investigated grey matter changes in unmethylated amphetamines . in northern europe, however, the vast majority of amphetamine abused is unmethylated  <cit> . members of our group has also observed this trend in a clinical study based on bi-weekly urine toxicology tests of eighty patients at the addiction centre, stockholm  <cit> .

separating amphetamine effects from other drug related effects on brain cortical thickness is made difficult as a diagnosis of amphetamine abuse is frequently concurrent with abuse of other drugs such as alcohol or nicotine, with one study showing co-morbidity levels in excess of 90% for both substances  <cit> . alcohol abuse can lead to measurable cortical grey matter reductions  <cit> , which may be exacerbated by chronic smoking  <cit> .

the objective of the present study was to ascertain if amphetamine related brain cortical thickness deficits would be observed in a comparatively large real-world patient sample. much of the evidence for amphetamine-related brain injury, including the above-cited work on blood perfusion  <cit> , metabolism  <cit> , and white matter morphology  <cit> , suggests cortical injury would occur in frontal regions. as this suggestion is further supported by behavioral evidence  <cit> , we suspected that that amphetamine use might also associate with reduced grey matter thickness in frontal and prefrontal regions. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of cortical thickness alterations in amphetamine using, as opposed to methamphetamine using, subjects.

RESULTS
cortical regions showing amphetamine related thickness differences were identified by repeatedly testing for significant group differences at numerous finely spaced cortical locations. the test was a contrast analysis of a general linear model, a generalization of an anova test. the patients had been recruited for not having a diagnosis of alcohol dependence and none met dsm diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence. nonetheless, structured interviews found that  <dig> of the  <dig> patients had a history of heavy alcohol consumption . in order to identify effects attributable to the confounding effect of alcohol usage, the patients were subdivided into those with 0- <dig> years of heavy alcohol use , and those with more than  <dig> year of heavy alcohol use . the following four contrasts were tested:

a) all patients   vs controls ;

b) a0- <dig> patients  vs controls;

c) a> <dig> patients  vs controls;

d) a0- <dig> vs a> <dig> patients.

contrast c was then repeated with patients restricted to those with  <dig> or more years of heavy alcohol use . at a reviewer's suggestion, contrast c was also run with the original subject group  but with years of heavy alcohol use added to the model as a covariate. this is analogous to a one-way anova containing years of heavy alcohol use.

the results of each of the contrast analyses were as follows:

a) all amphetamine users compared to healthy control subjects  showed no significant differences for any cortical region.

b) patients with limited heavy alcohol use compared to healthy controls  showed no significant differences for any cortical region.

c) patients with more than  <dig> year of heavy alcohol use compared to healthy controls  showed thinner cortex in right hemisphere superior-frontal regions and left hemisphere pre-central regions in comparison to healthy controls. significantly thinner cortex was signaled by p-values less than  <dig> , a threshold with an expected false discovery rate under 5%. when the analysis was restricted to patients with  <dig> or more years of heavy alcohol use , the findings were similar but not strong enough to survive fdr correction at the 5% level. this could be due to a loss of power in the restricted subject sample. results from these two contrasts are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  when the model included years of heavy alcohol use, no results remained significant after fdr correction.

d) patients with limited heavy alcohol use compared with patients with more than  <dig> year of heavy alcohol use  showed no significant differences for any cortical region.

a final set of analyses were conducted to further help distinguish between amphetamine-related and alcohol-related differences. this set restricted itself to patients with less than  <dig> years of heavy alcohol use , who were divided into those with long-term amphetamine use  and those with short-term amphetamine use . two contrasts were tested:

e) long-term users vs short-term users, and

f) long-term users vs healthy controls .

in these final analyses, age was controlled for but not years of amphetamine use. no significant differences were observed in either of these two analyses.

discussion
this swedish sample of amphetamine dependent patients showed no convincing evidence of reduced cortical thickness except in conjunction with heavy alcohol consumption. significant findings were limited to thinner cortex in right superior-frontal regions and the left pre-central gyrus when heavy alcohol-using amphetamine subjects were compared to controls. these disappeared when the model controlled for years of heavy alcohol usage. no significant difference was found between the full patient group and controls. this suggests that the findings reflect the effects of alcohol. alcohol has been shown to negatively affect frontal brain regions in a number of studies. alcohol-related brain volume shrinkage was exaggerated in the prefrontal cortex  <cit> . another research lab observed that alcohol-related reductions in brain tissue were seen primarily in prefrontal and parietal regions  <cit> . selective neuronal loss in superior frontal association cortex in chronic alcoholics was reported by  <cit> .

the lack of difference between patients with limited and long-term heavy alcohol use , suggests the possibility of an interaction effect. keeping in mind, however, that 90% of the current patients reported use of nicotine at the time of scan, and that gazdzinski et al.   <cit>  found that chronic cigarette smoking may exacerbate regional chronic alcohol-induced brain injury, it is not possible to say if any speculated interaction was with amphetamine or nicotine.

the findings in the right hemisphere, here only found in conjunction with heavy alcohol use, correspond to the results reported in kim et al.'s  study of methamphetamine users  <cit> . this suggests a possibility of increased neurotoxicity in methamphetamine compared to amphetamine. thompson et al.'s  <dig> investigation of methamphetamine users, however, did not find evidence of grey matter loss in the frontal lobe  <cit> , but did find grey matter deficit in cingulate, limbic, and paralimbic regions.

screening for hcv was not present at the beginning of this study as awareness that hcv may cause brain dysfunction has arisen only in the last few years  <cit> . hcv prevalence was high in this subject population, as is typical for illicit intravenous drug users. mounting evidence suggests that hcv plays a role in many of the neurological alterations observed in amphetamine dependent subjects, such as the reduced dopamine transporters and n-acetylaspartate levels, along with increases in choline-containing compounds and alterations in cerebral glucose mechanisms  <cit> . conventional mr imaging, however, as used in the current study, was found to be normal in hcv positive subjects compared to controls  <cit> . thus while it is likely that hcv infections have negative neurological effects on our patients, little evidence suggests that hcv has directly influenced the negative findings in this study of cortical thickness.

the methamphetamine using patient was not excluded as the clinical interviews and urine toxology tests showed that patient also was using a racemic mixture. methamphetamine usage is a recent phenomenon in the nordic region  <cit> . it thus appeared that the patient was beginning to switch to methamphetamine, but that his  <dig> year career had included significant amounts of racemic amphetamine usage.

the present study's exclusion criteria were designed to eliminate cortical thinning due to use of illicit substances other than amphetamine or infection with hiv. structured clinical interviews confirmed that polydrug use in the current subjects was limited. infection with hiv was assessed only by an interview question. we did not exclude for the presence of symptoms fulfilling a dsm-iv diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder . the analysis did not control for years of education, though this variable was lower in the patients compared to the controls. since, however, all of these factors are typically associated with thinner cortex, and no difference was seen in our patents, it seems unlikely that any of these potential confounds explain the lack of non-alcohol associated differences.

the main analysis divided patients into those with one or less year of heavy alcohol use and those with more than one year of heavy alcohol use. this was necessitated by the low subject numbers reporting no history of heavy alcohol use. as alcohol-related brain tissue loss depends on length of use  <cit> , a one year cutoff was chosen. follow-up analysis divided subjects using  <dig> or more years of heavy alcohol use as a cutoff. this level, while supported by a correlation analysis, remains arbitrary. it is likely that the correlation analysis would have produced similar results had the threshold been  <dig>  or  <dig> years, nor should any correlation reported here be considered representative of the general population.

strengths of the present study were the comparatively large well-characterized subject material and the method to examine cerebral cortex thickness throughout the entire cortical mantle with submillimeter precision.

CONCLUSIONS
no evidence was found for a relationship between amphetamine usage and cortical grey matter thickness reductions, except in the presence of co-morbid heavy alcohol usage. we note that cortical thickness is only one measure of brain anatomy. amphetamine and methamphetamine neurotoxicity has been demonstrated using numerous other measures of brain anatomy and function. it cannot be excluded that the effects were modulated by amphetamine toxicity but effects of amphetamine use alone were not confirmed.
