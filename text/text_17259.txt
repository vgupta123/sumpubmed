BACKGROUND
the embryonic gonad has the potential to develop into a fully functional organ able to produce the gametes necessary for sexual reproduction. sex differentiation is a crucial step in this developmental process and is considered as the differentiation from a bipotential gonadal primordium towards a testis or an ovary. in teleostean fish, sex differentiation can be controlled by in vivo treatments with sex steroids  as in reptiles and amphibians and to some extent in birds . in fish, these steroid treatments are often able to induce fully functional sex-inversed phenotypes and these treatments have been widely used to produce all-male or all-female populations of fish for aquaculture purposes  <cit> . many studies have been focused on the role of these hormones during gonadal sex differentiation highlighting for instance the crucial role of estrogens in ovarian differentiation  <cit> . however, most of the studies performed thus far were focused on a very small number of well characterized genes, proteins or hormones and mostly on natural gonadal differentiation.

rainbow trout, oncorhynchus mykiss, has a male heterogametic xy genetic system and we experimentally produced xx and yy males allowing the production of genetically all-male and all-female populations  <cit> . these all-male or all-female populations provide a unique opportunity to work on numerous animals for which the normal gonadal development as testis or ovary is known a priori. using the extensive collection of expressed sequenced tags  obtained through sequencing projects in trout as a resource  <cit> , we designed and built a dna microarray in order to characterize, on a genome-wide scale, the mechanisms by which 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione , a natural androgen in fish  <cit>  is able to masculinize the embryonic ovary.

using this genome-wide approach we characterized  <dig>  genes  with a clear differential temporal expression profile in females masculinized by androgen. we classified these genes in  <dig> different clusters of correlated temporal expression profiles, and searched within these clusters for significant enrichment in gene ontology  terms. this strategy allowed us to define a few very clear biological trends potentially explaining how androgen induces masculinization of female fish. our results clearly demonstrate that masculinization with androgen proceeds through a marked dysregulation of gene expression profiles, including a quick down-regulation of the ovarian pathway. surprisingly, most of the genes over-expressed during natural testicular differentiation were not restored by the androgen-induced masculinization suggesting that the inhibition of female gonadal development is the main required step sufficient for building a testis.

RESULTS
the complete dataset is available through the national center for biotechnology information , in the gene expression omnibus database  <cit>  under the gse <dig> accession number. after statistical filtering,  <dig>  expression profiles  were identified as being characteristic for either natural differentiation  or androgen-induced masculinization . among these  <dig>  expression profiles, 73%  were associated with genes with significant homologies with well characterized proteins in swissprot or prodom databases .

biological sample clustering and histology
this analysis was carried out on fish sampled at several stages of development from the onset of the free swimming period , when fish first started to be fed with the androgen treatment until  <dig> days after the beginning of the treatment . unsupervised hierarchical clustering of samples  reveals  <dig> main groups of correlated samples according to their global gene expression profiles i.e., late ovarian samples , middle and late gonad samples of androgen-treated fish gonads  and middle and late testicular samples . all early samples  cluster together with a weak correlation , indicating that differences in the expression profiles of these early samples are rather large. histological analysis of gonads at d <dig>  reveals characteristic features of differentiating gonads in control fish with the first appearance of ovarian meiosis and lamellar structures in females, or spermatogonia cysts in males. at this time-point , gonads of androgen-treated females appear as a thin structure characterized by scattered germ cells in a predominant stroma of conjunctive tissue with fibroblast like cells. after  <dig> days of treatment  the gonads of androgen-treated females display a classical testicular organization with cysts of germ cells engaged at various stages of meioses whereas the control male gonads show the same organization but with only gonial mitosis. at d <dig>  the control female gonads contain previtellogenic oocytes surrounded by flattened granulosa cells and oogonia within clearly organized ovarian lamellae.

global analysis of gene expression profiles
the  <dig>  expression profiles were analyzed using a k-means clustering  in order to individualize clusters of genes with similar expression profiles . these expression profiles and the  <dig> k-means clusters are available online as a browseable file  <cit> . among these clusters, clusters  <dig> to  <dig> are characterized by a specific high expression levels of a very large number of genes  specific to the late ovarian samples . these clusters could have been merged as their expression profiles seem very similar. in cluster  <dig>  these high expression levels in the female group after d <dig> are also present in the androgen-treated group after d <dig>  cluster  <dig>  contains genes with increasing expression profiles starting from d <dig> in androgen-treated females and from d <dig> in control males. clusters  <dig>  and  <dig>  are characterized by an early  or late  increase in gene expression specific to the androgen-treated females. genes in cluster  <dig>  display a late down-regulation starting from d <dig> in control female gonads. cluster  <dig>  is the only cluster that does not show any difference between males, females and androgen-treated females and contains genes with continuously decreasing expression levels from d <dig> to d <dig>  cluster  <dig>  contains genes down-regulated both in females  and androgen-treated females . cluster  <dig>  is characterized by gene expression levels specifically down-regulated  in androgen-treated females. however, this down-regulation is not maintained after the end of the treatment . cluster  <dig> is the smallest cluster in terms of the number of genes  and it displays high expression levels specifically in males throughout all the sampling times . expression levels in androgen-treated females slightly increase after completion of the treatment .

annotation of gene clusters using gene ontology 
we then searched for gene ontology  terms significantly enriched in these groups of correlated expression profiles compared to the overall go terms found. among the  <dig>  genes with an annotation we selected  <dig>  unique genes annotated with an official name, and  <dig>  were found to be associated with at least one go category. the top  <dig> significantly enriched go terms for each of the clusters are described in table  <dig> and  <dig> and the complete analysis is available online .

these go terms were selected as the  <dig> most significant go terms enriched in each k-means cluster   <dig> to  <dig> with a p-value <  <dig>  and a relative enrichment re >  <dig> . n/n: number of genes assigned with a specific go term in the cluster  with regards to the number of all genes assigned with the same go term in the  <dig>  analyzed genes . interesting go terms in regard to gonad differentiation and development are underlined. genes with go terms in bold type are detailed in figures  <dig> to  <dig>  go categories containing fewer than  <dig> genes were excluded.

these go terms were selected as the  <dig> most significant go terms enriched in each k-means cluster   <dig> to  <dig> with a p-value <  <dig>  and a relative enrichment re >  <dig>  n/n: number of genes assigned with a specific go term in the cluster  with regards to the number of all genes assigned with the same go term in the  <dig>  analyzed genes . interesting go terms in regard to gonad differentiation and development are underlined. genes with go terms in bold type are detailed in figure  <dig>  go categories containing fewer than  <dig> genes were excluded.

as gene expression in clusters  <dig> to  <dig> displayed similar expression profiles in the control female group, these clusters have been analysed both all together and separately . if considered as a homogenous cluster it displays considerable enrichments in go terms likely to be important characteristics of these late ovarian stages. among these go terms the most representatives  are the 'regulation of progression through cell cycle'  , the 'macromolecule biosynthesis'   and the cellular component ontology 'nucleolus' . go term 'mitosis'  is highly over-represented in cluster  <dig>  with a  <dig>  fold relative enrichment . among clusters  <dig> to  <dig>  only genes from cluster  <dig> are also highly expressed in the androgen-treated group. the main go theme of cluster  <dig> is related to translation, with over-representation of go 'ribosome' , 'ribonucleoprotein complex' , and 'ribosome biogenesis and assembly' . within the go term 'ribosome', a large proportion of genes  up-regulated in cluster  <dig> are also annotated as 'cytosolic large ribosomal subunit' . cluster  <dig> contains genes that are up-regulated both in control males and androgen-treated females. it contains genes  involved in 'cell surface' , 't cell activation'  and the 'immune response' . clusters  <dig> and  <dig> are of particular interest as they display an up-regulation only in androgen-treated females. cluster  <dig> is characterized by the go terms 'extracellular matrix' , 'actin binding' and 'muscle contraction'  including genes like myosins , tropomyosins  and some muscle markers . the go term 'extracellular matrix'  contains  <dig> different genes, and  <dig> are specifically up-regulated in cluster  <dig> following androgen treatment in females . many of these genes , are 'structural constituents of the extracellular matrix' , or are involved in 'cell adhesion'  . the expression profiles of some of these genes related to the extracellular matrix are shown in figure  <dig> along with the tgfb <dig> expression profile that also shows a slight up-regulation from d <dig> to d <dig> following androgen treatment in females. cluster  <dig> contains genes related to 'chromosome' , 'condensed chromosome'  but also, albeit only a few , to the 'progression through the first phase of meiosis' . cluster  <dig> is characterized by enrichment in the go terms 'organ morphogenesis' , 'development'  and 'structural constituent of cytoskeleton' . cluster  <dig> contains genes involved in 'urogenital system development'  and 'lipid binding' . clusters  <dig> and  <dig> contain genes that are also assigned with the go term 'extracellular matrix' but more specifically in relation with degradation of this extracellular matrix i.e., go term 'metallopeptidase'  with at least  <dig> matrix metallopeptidases  that are directly involved in 'collagen catabolism' . cluster  <dig> contains genes related to 'sex differentiation'  , and 'steroid biosynthesis'  . according to these annotations this cluster is likely to contain other important genes also involved in testicular differentiation or in steroidogenesis regulation. several expression profiles for such potential genes are shown in figure  <dig> 

validation and enrichment of dna microarray data by real-time rt-pcr
expression profiles of  <dig> genes, involved in early gonad development, were measured by real-time rt-pcr. these genes all belonged to the  <dig> distinct k-means clusters . among these  <dig> genes,  <dig> were only measured by real-time rt-pcr and these gene expression profiles were thus added to the microarray dataset. the remaining  <dig> genes were common between the real-time rt-pcr dataset and the microarray dataset  and were used to validate our microarray dataset. among the  <dig> common genes belonging to  <dig> out of the  <dig> distinct k-means clusters ,  <dig> expression profiles were found to have a significant correlation between the two techniques . only tfa , timp <dig>  and bzrp  expression profiles did not significantly correlate. as a result, among the  <dig> k-means groups, at least  <dig> groups  contained genes with significant correlation between real-time rt-pcr and dna microarray measurements.

each gene is depicted by its gene symbol and gene name . symbols for mouse and human homolog genes are also given with their corresponding genbank accession number. k-means cluster number  is given for each gene with the correlation coefficient r to compare correlation between expression profiles measured by real-time rt-pcr  and microarrays . significant correlations were determined using the pearson's correlation coefficient test .

discussion
our global approach based on gene expression profiling clearly reveals that, in our experimental conditions , the androgen masculinization does not induce a natural physiological response since the transcriptome of testicular trans-differentiating gonads is quite different from the one observed during natural testicular differentiation. these differences might be due to the non physiological dosage of androgen used in our experiment. a similar study using a lower dosage may help to clarify this issue, but this study was first designed with an androgen dosage that is commonly used in rainbow trout aquaculture conditions. whether the observed gene expression dysregulations are the reflection of a direct action of the androgens on the gonad, an indirect retro-control on the hypothalamus-pituitary axis, or a conjunction of both, remains to be elucidated. however, the synthesis of gonadotropin releasing hormone  and of pituitary hormones is established very early during rainbow trout ontogenesis  <cit>  with at least the synthesis of follicle stimulating hormone fsh  <cit> . thus indirect feedback effects cannot be totally excluded.

due to the lack of specific gene ontology  annotation for rainbow trout we linked the best blast hits of each clone sequence with a cross-species go annotation. this strategy relies on the accuracy of the blast homology search and also on the resulting accuracy of the go annotations with regards to their use in a fish species. however, even if this could lead to potential errors on a gene per gene scale, the global analysis and stringent statistical screen that we carried out enabled us to unambiguously assign most clusters with a clear biological theme. among these go categories, some were considered as biologically informative – i.e., not too general like for instance go "physiological process" – and robust as they contain a sufficient number of different genes to support a potential biological meaning. we focused our analysis on these biologically informative go categories.

with regards to the effects on the gonad, our analysis first reveals that female development is highly affected by the androgen treatment, with a down-regulation of most of the genes involved in early oogenesis stages. however within this analysis we did not characterize any cluster of early female-specific up-regulated genes potentially involved in ovarian differentiation. expression profiles of some female-specific candidate genes  <cit>   were introduced in our analysis and all these genes were strongly and quickly inhibited by the masculinizing androgen treatment. but when pooled with our dna microarrays dataset they did not form a tight cluster. this is probably because no additional similar expression profile was found within the dna microarray dataset. this very small number of early female-specific genes is in agreement with the small number of candidate genes known to be involved in the ovarian differentiation pathway  <cit>  in comparison with the relatively high number of genes that are known to characterize testicular differentiation  <cit> . in agreement with this view, our analysis clearly characterizes a cluster displaying testicular-specific gene expression profiles, containing both genes known to be involved in testicular differentiation   <cit>  and some potential new players revealed by our analysis. interestingly the expression levels of all these genes are not restored by the androgen masculinizing treatment, and this could indicate that they are probably not necessary for early testicular differentiation in rainbow trout.

among the gene clusters specifically up-regulated in females following masculinization with androgens, extracellular matrix, muscle markers/cytoskeleton and meiosis were characterized as the  <dig> main gene annotations. simultaneous up-regulation of extracellular matrix protein genes expression and down-regulation of matrix proteinase genes was detected in gonads of androgen-treated females. at the same time the histological analysis of these gonads showed that they contain a predominant stroma of conjunctive tissue with fibroblast like cells. matrix protein synthesis and the concomitant decrease in matrix proteinase activity have been well described as a characteristic fibrotic response of an excessive transforming growth factor-beta  production  <cit> . of special interest in that context is the up-regulation of transforming growth factor-β <dig>  in gonads of androgen-treated animals. in rat, tgfβ induced morphological changes in leydig cells, accompanied by an increased secretion of fibronectin, laminin and collagen iv  <cit> . in fibroblasts treated with tgfβ <dig> a similar over-expression of genes associated with matrix formation has been detected including many different matrix protein genes, like sparc , mgp , and tgfβ <dig> itself  <cit> , that we also detected as up-regulated in gonads following androgen treatment. it could then be hypothesized that this late androgen up-regulation of tgfb <dig> in trout gonads triggers a fibrotic response. surprisingly, these effects are detected transiently and rather late after the application of the androgen treatment . whether this reflects a total dysregulation or an exacerbation of a testicular-specific event remains to be analyzed. however, extracellular matrix deposition is known as a major event for the testicular organization. for instance, lama <dig>  has been characterized as a structural protein involved in the formation of the basement membrane of the testicular cords  <cit>  and this protein was found to be anti-correlated with anti-müllerian hormone   <cit> . in trout gonads, amh expression is not restored to male levels in androgen-treated females. this may produce a disrupted expression of some structural proteins, like lama <dig>  in the same manner, sparc is highly up-regulated in androgen-treated females. in mouse sparc gene expression has been identified in pre-sertoli cells at the time of sex differentiation  <cit>  and this protein has also been postulated to play a crucial role in both leydig and sertoli cells differentiation by affecting their morphology  <cit> . structural proteins including matrix proteins are then of major importance for a complete and functional testicular differentiation and their up-regulation in trout following an androgen treatment inducing testicular transdifferentiation may be the consequence of a dysregulation of some major regulators of their synthesis like amh or tgfb <dig> 

we also detected a high number of genes associated with cytoskeletal reorganization and muscle development that were up-regulated by the treatment. some of them  are even considered as characteristic smooth muscle markers. this expression of muscle markers in the testis is likely in relation with the peritubular myoid cells that surround the seminiferous tubules  <cit> . these myoid cells are known to express muscle markers like for instance, tpm <dig>   <cit> , smooth muscle alpha-actin  <cit> , and smooth muscle myosin  <cit> . differentiation of these cells is androgen dependent  <cit>  and they contribute to the testicular secretion of extracellular matrix components  <cit>  along with the sertoli cells  <cit> . it is therefore suggested that the masculinizing androgen treatment may induce the differentiation and subsequently a disturbed androgen-dependent proliferation of these peritubular myoid cells. these cells are also probably involved in the important extracellular matrix synthesis that occurs concomitantly with this differentiation.

in our experiment, the androgen treatment also induced a precocious spermatogenesis as revealed both by the histological analysis and by the increased expression levels of some genes involved in testicular meiosis. in fish, androgens and particularly, 11-oxygenated androgens, are strongly involved in spermatogenesis regulation  <cit>  and they have been shown to directly induce spermatogenesis in vitro in some species  <cit> . similarly, in mammals, three independent studies using sertoli cell-specific ar-knockout mice  demonstrated that the action of androgen is an absolute requirement for the completion of spermatogenesis, particularly in the process of meiosis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study gives a first comprehensive survey of gene expression during androgen-induced masculinization in female rainbow trout. our data provide supportive evidences that this treatment results in a marked dysregulation of gene expression levels when compared to natural testicular or ovarian differentiation. in our experimental condition the androgen treatment induces the complete down-regulation of female specific genes, but not the complete restoration of the male-specific gene expression patterns. instead, some disturbed responses were characterized by an exacerbation of extracellular matrix synthesis and muscle type cell differentiation and proliferation  followed by a precocious meiosis of germ cells. all together, we suggest that androgen masculinization acts mainly through an early inhibition of female development rather than through a direct induction of testicular differentiation.
