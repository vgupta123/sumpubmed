BACKGROUND
there is a great interest in using genetic association studies to identify the disease-susceptibility variants related to the common complex diseases. to design these studies appropriately, it is important to understand the feature of linkage disequilibrium  in candidate genes or genomic regions of interest  <cit> . several studies have shown that the human genome contains regions of high ld value with low haplotype diversity by a small number of snps  <cit> . these regions are called haplotype block, each of which reflects the descent from a single ancient ancestral chromosome. the construction of a haplotype block is one way to reduce the complexity of the problem of association mapping of the common complex diseases.

haplotype blocks are defined computationally by various algorithms. in general, they are classified into the following categories: recombination-based, ld-based, and diversity-based methods. these block definitions are consistent with a block-covered sequence, which is considered a block as a part of the genomic sequence. however, the haplotype block border is not usually stable, and blocks can fall into sub-blocks within the border  <cit> .

the general properties of haplotype block construction in the human genome are not well understood. thus, the international haplotype map  project has genotyped a huge number of snps in samples from subjects of caucasian, african, and asian descent to better understand the human haplotype structure  <cit> . several studies  have shown differences in ld and haplotype block patterns in populations and chromosomes. in addition, it was revealed that snps ascertainment, selection and spacing could explain the observed block length  <cit> , and that snps density has a crucial influence on the length of method-defined blocks  <cit> . despite the extensive empirical studies on haplotype blocks, there is no definitive answer as to how sample size impacts the assessment of block structure. for example, a study on chromosome  <dig> examined  <dig> independent subjects from diverse populations  <cit> . even for a relatively large data set, it contained only  <dig> individual samples, leading to  <dig> independent chromosomes  <cit> . thus, it was possible that the detected block structure was dependent on the small number of samples, and this seemed a preliminary finding. it remains unclear how many individuals are needed to acquire reliable features of haplotype block  <cit> .

in this study, we developed a simulation with random re-sampling from real genotyping data in  <dig> japanese and introduced an original measurement of θ value for the identification of haplotype block defined by three algorithms. with the original measurement, we focused on haplotype block structure, especially within a high ld region. we further assessed the robustness of haplotype blocks estimated under the different sample size conditions.

RESULTS
selection of the analyzed region
one region was selected on chromosome 20q <dig> , in which a single strong |d'| block was observed without substantial recombination in the current population . however, the region was broken into small blocks by r <dig>  the average values of |d'| and r <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. based on ncbi human build  <dig>  the total length was about  <dig> kb from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> bp. this region was composed of  <dig> snps, and the average distance between snps was  <dig>  kb. snps with maf greater than  <dig>   were used for subsequent study. detailed information on selected snps is shown in table  <dig> 

genome position is based on the ncbi build  <dig>  the number of called sample is the number after excluding the undetermined sample with taqman assay. hwe denotes hardy-weinberg equilibrium. 95% ci denotes 95% confidence interval. the crude odds ratio was calculated for the allele model.

use of a novel measurement: θ value
an original measurement  was used for block identification. the θ value represents the probability of whether a snps interval resides within or outside a haplotype block. the word "interval" as used here refers to the region between two adjacent snps . using the θ value with more than two block definitions allows an estimation of the suitable structure of the haplotype block in the region of interest.

in the analyzed region, different reference haplotype blocks were identified with three separate algorithms, despite a single strong |d'| value . to evaluate the discrepancy in block identification, θ profiles were calculated for all pairwise snps with a flow chart in fig.  <dig> 

the influence of the mixture of cases with control samples was examined first. θ profiles calculated with only controls  were compared to the mixed data of controls and cases . the mean square errors  between the two data sets was calculated, where mse was the sum of the variance and squared bias of the estimates  <cit> . the observed mse values were under  <dig>   ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . similarly, when θ profiles were compared with mixed data from  <dig> samples , the mse values were under  <dig> , leading to a reasonable accuracy for the combination of the two groups . this calculation suggested that the profound bias of the mixture of cases was rather low. in addition, there were no significant differences  in allele frequencies with all  <dig> snps in a case-control association study and all snps satisfied with hwe test . as a result, the genotyping data from  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls were merged for a total of  <dig> samples of japanese genotyping data.

with the maximum sample size of  <dig> subjects and  <dig>  repeat times, θ profiles were plotted against the physical position of the snps . the complete concordance of haplotype blocks was observed in some intervals  and ), but not in others , , , and ). it may be difficult to clearly identify the haplotype block even for the θ value. for subsequent analyses, two intervals,  and , were selected as the complete concordance regions of the block, and four intervals from  to  were defined as incomplete concordance regions.

reference haplotype blocks and θ value
although there was a difference among reference haplotype blocks across the analyzed region , θ profiles generated by the three algorithms were comparatively similar . we compared θ profiles with reference haplotype blocks defined by  <dig> samples.

in the interval , a reference haplotype block was disrupted by the four-gamete test, but it was continuous with the other two methods . this finding, supported by the intermediate r <dig> value, identified interval  as the fragile region of haplotype block. in contrast, θ profiles showed low values  with all three algorithms in the corresponding interval  in fig. 1c). namely, interval  was identified as the transition zone in 20% of  <dig>  simulations of the θ values. interpretation of the θ profiles reveals that interval  might be included in the transition zone of the block, and that ld might be disrupted against the estimation of gabriel's and kamatani's methods.

all reference haplotype blocks were continuous in the interval  . however, four-gamete test showed a θ value of  <dig>  after  <dig>  simulations and a divided interval . in addition, the θ value was not zero with the other two algorithms. similar discrepancies were observed between the θ value and reference blocks defined by a single algorithm with two other intervals  and . it was quite difficult to clearly identify the block structure in these snps intervals. these results suggest that haplotype blocks might be fragile with one block algorithm, even if the region showed a single strong ld value defined by |d'|.

data simulation by θ value
to evaluate the effect of sample size on the identification of haplotype blocks, θ profiles were calculated with a variable number of sample sizes . fig.  <dig> left side panels show the results obtained with intervals  and . within these two intervals, complete concordance was observed between the θ value and reference block definitions. the θ value could increase or decrease to the maximum or minimum value  dependent on the sample size, and it converged when using more than  <dig> samples. this result suggests that sample size could have an effect on the identification of haplotype block, and it was not possible to obtain a reliable block identification for data with less than  <dig> samples.

there was also a difficulty with haplotype block definitions within the other four intervals , , , and ) in spite of the estimation by the θ value. the θ values in these intervals were more strongly influenced by sample size than those in intervals  and . in particular, the θ value did not converge even for calculations with more than  <dig> samples. this might imply that the precise identification of haplotype block was difficult for data with  <dig> samples. however, the exact number of samples required to reach the plateau value for precise evaluation of haplotype block remains unclear.

θ profiles were also generated after changing the number of simulation times  up to the maximum repeat times of  <dig>  . the θ value converged and reached the plateau value in all algorithms when simulations were repeated  <dig>  times. thus, the θ value with  <dig>  repeat times was reliable for block identification with the plateau value in the simulation. in the simulation of  <dig> samples , the θ value was not equal to the result in  <dig> samples , even if the repeat times increased to the maximum . as a whole, these observations indicate that a sample size greater than  <dig> with a computational simulation of  <dig>  times is required to obtain a converged θ value.

discussion
given the importance of haplotype block for genome-wide association mapping, there is tremendous interest in constructing a haplotype block of the human genome. as a consequence, several questions have been raised about the nature of these blocks  <cit> . first, there are a number of variations in haplotype blocks based on the different block algorithms. in addition, several genetic factors, such as population, genetic marker density, and marker allele frequency, have contributed to the characteristics of haplotype blocks. however, it is not well known how many samples are sufficient to obtain reliable block characteristics  <cit> . to address this question, we genotyped  <dig> japanese subjects with > <dig>  snps on chromosome 20q. additionally, we exploited a simple but refined simulation, which provided an original measurement  generated by random re-sampling from the real genotyping data.

the simulated data were derived from a single population, hence our study does not address all ethnic groups. however, we found that the number of samples had an effect on the characteristics of haplotype block, even in a limited region of the human chromosome in a single population. indeed, the θ value could not reach plateau with less than  <dig> samples in some parts of the analyzed region. recent works also indicated that sample size has a marked effect on the detection of observed haplotype blocks  <cit> . that study showed that a large sample size was required to minimize the bias in means based on |d'|, while trying to reduce the bias by bootstrapping  <cit> . to identify more general properties of haplotype block, a relatively larger number of samples would be required than those in this study. however, it is not feasible to increase the number of samples. information on the variation of haplotype blocks is based on a trade-off between the accuracy of description, i.e., how much loss of information is acceptable, and the genotyping efforts needed to achieve this accuracy  <cit> .

another important and unsolved issue is the extent of block boundary conservation; namely, how fragile is the haplotype structure? to address this question, three different definitions of haplotype blocks were employed  <cit> . however, the primary concept of three algorithms was based on |d'| and focused on historical recombination, not allelic association. we could not avoid any bias resulting from a particular method. although concordance of haplotype blocks exists in some regions, they are not common and might break up even if the region shows a single strong |d'| value  <cit> . as described above, the block did not have absolute boundaries and might be defined in different ways. in addition, our simulation provides only one of many possible approaches. it is difficult to compare the advantage of these algorithms because block identification was influenced by thresholds in the algorithms. it remains unclear how best to merge or integrate block definitions from different algorithms. we will not discuss the advantage of a particular algorithm as we view this as a separate problem.

one potential weakness is a possible ascertainment bias against snps allele frequency, which could influence haplotype block characteristics. snps with minor allele frequency greater than 10% were selected in this analysis, underscoring the variety of haplotype blocks. therefore, our results cannot be used to infer the complete nature of haplotype blocks, because we referred to limited haplotype diversity from a bias in common snps.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a computational simulation that provides a realistic estimation of the observed genotyping data and attempted to unravel the underlying complexity of haplotype block. based on this simulation, the sample size had an effect on the inferred haplotype block structure. for a valid description of haplotype blocks, further study will be required with a larger number of samples than presented here.
