BACKGROUND
there is a large number of pharmacological strategies for treating serotonin-related disorders like depression and anxiety. well-known antidepressant drug effects are blockade of the serotonin  and/or norepinephrine  reuptake pumps, direct effects on the 5-ht- and/or ne receptors and inhibition of the monoamine oxidase a  enzyme. irrespective of which drug or combination of drugs that is used, there is a delay of a few weeks before any therapeutic effect is noticed. this initial lag-period usually is associated with several side-effects, many of which fade away with the appearance of the therapeutic effect. considering the lag-period needed for the antidepressant effect to emerge, it has been suggested that the antidepressant mechanisms involve secondary molecular neuronal adaptations, rather than being a result of the primary actions of the drugs  <cit> . some attempts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in such lag-period have been reported, for example both ssris and mao-is cause desensitization of somatodendritic 5-ht1a autoreceptors  <cit> . furthermore, ssris have also, during the initial lag period, been shown to cause desensitization of terminal 5-ht1b/1d autoreceptors  <cit> . gaining more knowledge about molecular mechanisms involved in the initial lag-period may prove important for the discovery of new antidepressant drug targets and also for the knowledge of the mechanisms of action of antidepressants. transcription factors, with their specific ability to regulate gene expression, have been suggested as prominent novel drug targets  <cit> . transcription factor ap- <dig> is a critical regulatory factor for neuronal gene expression and neuronal development, e.g., in the brainstem  <cit> . five different ap- <dig> genes have been identified, i.e., ap-2α, ap-2β, ap-2γ, ap-2δ and ap-2ε  <cit> . the isoforms are expressed from different genes and have a molecular weight of around  <dig> kd. the cis-acting dna sequences 5'-ccca-3' and the palindromic sequence 5'-gccnnnggc-3' are considered as consensus ap- <dig> binding sites for all ap- <dig> proteins  <cit> . several genes encoding proteins involved in the brainstem monoaminergic systems have multiple ap- <dig> binding sites in their regulatory regions  <cit>  indicating an involvement of ap- <dig> in the expression of these genes. we have recently reported positive correlations between brainstem ap-2α and ap-2β levels and monoaminergic activity in rat frontal cortex  <cit> , indicating a regulatory function of ap-2α and ap-2β not only for neuronal development, but also for neuronal adaptive mechanisms in the adult brain. in two independent studies it was shown that the ap-2β genotype is associated with anxiety-related personality traits  <cit> . the ap-2β genotype has also been linked to binge-eating disorder  <cit>  and to platelet mao activity  <cit> , which the latter is associated with personality traits. furthermore, the ap-2β genotype has been associated to csf-levels of homovanillic acid  in women  <cit> .

in a previous study, we reported that the levels of ap-2α and ap-2β were decreased in rat whole brain after treatment for  <dig> days with citalopram, imipramine and lithium, respectively  <cit> . we have also reported that citalopram changes the levels of ap-2α and ap-2β in rat whole brain in a time-dependent manner, i.e., ap- <dig> levels were decreased after  <dig> days of treatment but returned to control levels after  <dig> days of treatment  <cit> . furthermore, ap-2α and ap-2β levels were shown to be increased in rat whole brain after  <dig> days of treatment with phenelzine  <cit> . in the present study, we report that neither treatment with citalopram for  <dig>   <dig> nor  <dig> days affect the ap-2α and ap-2β levels in the rat brainstem. treatment with phenelzine, however, increased the levels of both ap-2α and ap-2β in the rat brainstem after  <dig> days of treatment, but after  <dig> days of treatment the levels had returned to control levels.

RESULTS
the mean relative amounts of ap-2α and ap-2β protein ± standard deviation  for each of the citalopram-, phenelzine- and saline treated animal groups are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. no significant differences in the amounts of ap-2α and ap-2β were found between any of the citalopram and saline treated groups. with regard to phenelzine treatment, there was a significant increase in ap-2α levels after  <dig> days of treatment , which returned to control levels after  <dig> days. a similar result was obtained with regard to ap-2β levels with a significant increase only after  <dig> days of treatment .

values are means ± sd, for each group of animals, n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig>  as compared to animals treated with saline for the same time-period.

when comparing the untreated naive animals with the treated animal groups no differences with regard to the levels of ap-2α  or ap-2β  were found. moreover, no differences in the levels of ap-2α and ap-2β were observed between the groups of animals treated with saline for the different time periods.

discussion
in two independent studies, we have shown that the levels of ap-2α and ap-2β in rat whole brain were decreased after subchronic  treatment with citalopram  <cit> . we have also shown that the ap-2α and ap-2β levels in rat whole brain were increased after treatment with phenelzine for  <dig> days  <cit> . for several reasons, we hypothesized that the brainstem should be of particular importance in this regard. thus, many genes encoding proteins involved in the brainstem monoaminergic systems have binding sites for ap- <dig> in their regulatory regions. furthermore, we have previously observed correlations between brainstem ap- <dig> levels and cortical monoamine activity  <cit> . the lag-period initially seen before the antidepressant therapeutic effect is obtained also made it interesting to study possible changes in ap- <dig> levels over time. in the present study, we found that treatment with citalopram for  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> days did not have any effect on the brainstem levels of ap-2α and ap-2β. treatment with phenelzine for  <dig> days, on the other hand, increased the brainstem levels of ap-2α and ap-2β, but after  <dig> days of treatment the levels had returned to control levels. the phenelzine data presented here, are in line with our previous study showing an increase in ap-2α and ap-2β levels in rat whole brain after  <dig> days of treatment with phenelzine  <cit> .

the different responses on ap- <dig> of citalopram and phenelzine are likely to be explained by the different molecular mechanisms of the two drugs. considerering the specific drug targets for citalopram and phenelzine, respectively, the target for citalopram, 5-htt, is specific for membranes of the serotonergic system, while the target for phenelzine, mao-a, is not located in the serononergic neurons  <cit> . it has been shown that some ssris, to some extent, are also able to inhibit mao-activity  <cit> . however, all ssris, including citalopram, tested had a much higher selectivity for mao-b than mao-a and mao-a, and not mao-b, is the enzyme considered to be involved in the antidepressant effect  <cit> . thus, a mao-inhibiting effect of citalopram should not be a confounding factor with regard to interpretation of the present results. the fact that citalopram treatment did not affect ap- <dig> levels in rat brainstem indicates that the decrease in ap- <dig> levels previously seen in rat whole brain after citalopram treatment, takes place in some other brain region. it has been shown that postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors in hippocampus get an enhanced response to 5-ht after treatment with tca  for a time-period that corresponds to the time required for initiation of the antidepressant therapeutic effect  <cit> . an increased 5-ht responsiveness has also been demonstrated for other serotonin receptors than 5-ht1a and in other projection areas than hippocampus  <cit> . thus, there are reasons to presume that the effect we have seen on ap- <dig> levels after subchronic citalopram treatment occurs in the 5-ht projection areas rather than in the 5-ht cell bodies in the brainstem. with regard to the increase in brainstem levels of ap- <dig> after  <dig> days of phenelzine treatment, it is in line with previous reports that mao-is partially enhance the 5-ht transmission by increasing the amount of 5-ht released per action potential  <cit> , an effect which is likely to be regulated by presynaptic mechanisms located in the brainstem. the temporary changes in ap- <dig> levels after administration of antidepressants , coinciding in time with the appearance of side-effects, makes it tempting to speculate that those two phenomena are somehow interrelated.

in a previous study, we reported higher levels of ap-2α and ap-2β in rat whole brain in untreated naive animals compared to animals treated with citalopram or saline for different time periods  <cit> . in the present study, however, we did not see any differences in the brainstem levels of ap-2α and ap-2β between naive untreated animals and treated animal groups. this indicates that the changes in ap-2α and ap-2β levels in rat whole brain previously seen in animals treated with citalopram or saline compared to naive untreated animals are located in some other ap- <dig> containing brain region than the brainstem.

as mentioned earlier, we have previously shown that the ap-2β genotype is associated with platelet mao activity  <cit> . thus, it is seems likely that ap- <dig> is involved in the regulation of the expression of the mao enzyme. a possible explanation for the elevated ap-2α and ap-2β levels during subchronic phenelzine treatment could be that they are part of a feedback mechanism to counteract the reduction in mao activity.

CONCLUSIONS
unraveling of the molecular mechanisms involved in the initial phase of antidepressant treatment is essential for the development of new efficient antidepressant drugs with less side-effects. we find transcription factors, such as ap- <dig>  with ability to regulate expression of specific genes involved in the monoaminergic mechanisms, to be interesting candidates as novel antidepressant drug targets.
