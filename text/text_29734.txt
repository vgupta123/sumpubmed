BACKGROUND
genetic variability in a given gene is the result of a complex interplay of evolutionary forces such as selection, mutation rate and recombination, and demographic history of the populations including changes in population size, migration and divergence
 <cit> . the evolution of insecticide resistance in invasive pest species offers an opportunity to study these forces where the form, target and history of selection, as well as invasion routes are often well known
 <cit> . evolution due to a strong directional selection by insecticides can be a rapid process [
 <cit>  and references therein], usually involving only a few genes with pronounced phenotypic influences
 <cit> . typically, mutations that confer resistance are considered to occur at very low frequency in the population due to fitness costs in non-insecticide environments
 <cit> . strong insecticide selection subsequently leads to an increase in the resistance allele frequency and a general change in the allele composition of populations . furthermore, a strong reduction in genetic variation is often observed as the originally rare mutation increases in frequency
 <cit> . this reduction may occur not only in the locus targeted by selection but also in the surrounding areas through linkage and genetic hitchhiking
 <cit> . alternatively, selection can act on standing genetic variation  leading to soft sweeps or even maintain variability
 <cit> .

in addition to selection by insecticides, populations of invasive pest species are often affected by demographic events. for instance, genetic variation is often reduced by population bottlenecks and allele frequencies can be drastically changed by founder events
 <cit> . subsequent range expansions, typically observed in species invasions
 <cit> , can contribute to the spread of an insecticide resistance allele across large regions without local insecticide selection
 <cit> . however, demographic events can be difficult to disentangle from selection as the former can lead to patterns of genetic variation similar to those caused by selection
 <cit> . these confounding effects can, in principle, be separated by examining multiple loci since demographic history modifies the genetic pattern of the whole genome whereas only certain loci are affected by selection
 <cit> .

studies of resistance genes have focused on revealing the nucleotide substitutions that are associated with resistance , while less attention has been paid to genetic variation in the resistance genes themselves. yet the level and pattern of genetic variation at the gene and population level may give a more comprehensive picture of the evolutionary forces affecting populations
 <cit> . comparing populations before and after selection  can provide important insights on the origins of resistance and how selection modifies patterns of genetic variability
 <cit> . for instance, the colorado potato beetle , an invasive insect pest of potato, is well known for its ability to evolve resistance to insecticides
 <cit>  and specific mutations at the target site of resistance to organophosphate and pyrethroids have been extensively investigated
 <cit> . however, few studies have examined the population genetic history of agricultural insect pest populations . by examining the population genetic history of agricultural insect pests, it will provide insight as to whether insect pests appear to be preadapted to insecticide resistance, or whether resistance arises from de novo mutations under intense selection.

organophosphates are one of the most common classes of insecticides used worldwide. they were introduced as insecticides in the 1930s after which their use increased rapidly and peaked in the 1970s and 1980s
 <cit> . due to intense use of op insecticides, resistance to ops subsequently appeared in various insect pest species, including the colorado potato beetle as early as  <dig> in us
 <cit> . op resistance in insects can be based on several mechanisms; the major ones are target-site insensitivity and enhanced detoxification of the toxicant. also lowered availability of the toxicant may play a role in resistance . target-site insensitivity is caused by point mutations in two ache genes 
 <cit>  that encode for acetylcholinesterase enzymes that function in the synapses of the nervous system. these point mutations cause insensitivity at the target site of insecticides action . there are at least two point mutations in the ache <dig> gene that have been associated with op resistance in the colorado potato beetle
 <cit> . the major resistance-conferring mutation, an amino acid substitution from serine to glycine , seems to be unique to this species
 <cit> . the second mutation , may enhance the resistance conferred by the s291g
 <cit> .

in addition for being famous for its ability to evolve insecticide resistance, the invasion history of the colorado potato beetle is relatively well known. the beetle is native to mexico where it uses wild relatives of potato  as host plants, and is not a pest of potato. it is thought that spanish settlers that migrated northwards with cattle inadvertently carried s. rostratum, northwards. the beetle was first described feeding on s. rostratum in  <dig> in nebraska. the beetle became a serious pest after adapting to potato  in the american mid-west in the 1850s
 <cit> . the first described outbreaks of the beetle occurred in  <dig> in the midwestern us
 <cit> . since, it has spread across the us and almost throughout europe
 <cit> . although its establishment in europe involved a founder event
 <cit>  which reduced neutral genetic variability, the beetle has retained a substantial amount of genetic variability in life history traits
 <cit> . currently, the colorado potato beetle is considered to be the major threat to potato crops worldwide. if left uncontrolled, it can cause serious damage to potato crops
 <cit> . the beetle’s complicated and versatile life history has contributed to its success. for instance, the beetle has a very high reproductive potential, both larvae and adults feed on potato, and adults can survive harsh winter conditions by overwintering in diapause burrowed into the soil
 <cit> .

we took advantage of the knowledge on one of the main mechanisms of op resistance and combined it with the invasion history of the colorado potato beetle to examine the origins of op resistance-associated mutations, and the selective and demographic forces on the genetic variation in the ache <dig> gene using a population genetic approach. in order to disentangle the confounding effects of demography from selection, we examined genetic variation at two other nuclear genes, the diapause protein  <dig> 
 <cit>  and putative juvenile hormone esterase 
 <cit> . if there was a clear sign of intense directional selection, we would expect lower genetic variability both at the ache <dig> locus than at the other two loci and in the invasive agricultural  than in native mexican beetle populations. we would also expect a higher frequency of the op resistance-associated s291g mutation in the invasive than in the native populations. finally, we searched for evidence of population genetic structure at the loci among geographic regions and investigated if nucleotide variability at the ache <dig>  dp <dig> and jhe genes are compatible with neutral expectations.

RESULTS
haplotypes and the frequency of resistance-associated mutations at the ache gene
the ache <dig> sequences from the  <dig> colorado potato beetles  yielded a total of  <dig> haplotypes containing  <dig> polymorphic sites . no indels were observed. of the  <dig> non-synonymous mutations two  are known to be associated with op resistance
 <cit>  of which the major resistance-associated mutation, s291g, was encountered in all populations examined. a third non-synonymous mutation  was present in europe and in the colorado population. five non-synonymous mutations  were specific to the colorado population, one  to the native kansas population whereas the remaining four  were specific to the native mexican populations . in general, the number of haplotypes as well as polymorphic sites was lower in europe than in the us or mexico . notably, the puebla population yielded most of the polymorphism in mexico  and had many  private substitutions. although the mexican morelos and oaxaca populations each had only  <dig> polymorphic sites  they possessed  <dig> private and fixed substitutions. there was only one polymorphic synonymous site present in europe that was not found in the north american populations. in general, haplotypes were not shared among populations. only three haplotypes  were common to both europe and the us. three haplotypes  were shared between colorado and kansas and five  between morelos and oaxaca. the dp <dig> and jhe-b sequences  yielded  <dig> haplotypes with  <dig> polymorphic sites, and  <dig> haplotypes with  <dig> polymorphic sites, respectively . similar to ache <dig>  the number of haplotypes and polymorphic sites was, in general, lower in europe than in north america .

the frequency of the op resistance-associated mutation s291g was very high in the us  and in mexican  whereas it was only 71% in the european beetles. at the genotypic level, 100% of genotypes carried the op resistance-associated mutation s291g in the north america populations and  <dig> %  and 100%  were homozygotes for this mutation . the frequency of genotypes carrying the s291g mutation was 89% in the european populations, and approximately half  of the beetles were homozygous. there were significant differences in the frequencies of genotypes among european populations . notably, all individuals in the finnish population carried s291g whereas the percentage was only 20% in the italian population . the second resistance associated mutation r30k was found in only two haplotypes   in the colorado population.

recombination might have played a role in shaping the genetic variation of the ache <dig> locus and may explain the high differentiation among the ache <dig> haplotypes. indeed, gard identified a breakpoint  in the alignment between nucleotides  <dig> and  <dig> with significant topological incongruence at the p-value =  <dig>  while no recombination breakpoints were identified in dp <dig> or jhe-b. separate haplotype genealogies for the two portions of the ache <dig> gene were constructed with hapview
 <cit>  that uses the topology of most parsimonious trees 
 <cit>  with branch lengths representing haplotype genealogies, i.e. discrete mutational steps. the portion of the gene before the recombination breakpoint contained  <dig> haplotypes connected by relatively long branches in the haplotype genealogy . the most common haplotypes in the populations were quite different, separated by  <dig> mutations. the us and european haplotypes did not form separate clusters but intermingled in the genealogy . the mexican morelos and oaxaca populations were highly differentiated from other haplotypes, forming a cluster of closely-related haplotypes. the haplotypes that lacked the op resistance-associated mutation s291g  were very different from each other . the portion after the recombination breakpoint showed only  <dig> haplotypes with the most common haplotypes in the populations being very closely related, differing by only  <dig> or  <dig> mutations .

the ld analysis for ache <dig> indicated that the degree of linkage between sites was considerably lower for the north american populations than in europe, irrespective of whether sites with minor haplotype frequency  were excluded or not  . in general, the estimated minimum number of recombination events was higher for the north american populations  than in europe  with the exceptions of the two mexican populations, morelos and oaxaca, where estimated rm was  <dig>  the degree of linkage between sites was, in general lower in north america than in europe for the dp <dig> also . the estimated minimum number of recombination events was higher for the north american populations  than in europe . finally, the degree of linkage between sites of jhe-b was low in both north american and european populations and there were no large differences in rm either .

the haplotype genealogy for dp <dig> sequences showed quite differentiated haplotypes with long branches connecting them . the most common haplotypes were separated by 3– <dig> mutation steps. the us and european haplotypes did not form separate clusters but intermingled in the haplotype genealogy while the mexican morelos and oaxaca haplotypes formed a separate group as in the haplotype genealogy for the portion of the ache <dig> gene before the recombination breakpoint. although we did not have an extensive sampling for jhe-b, the haplotype genealogy was similar in structure to the dp <dig> haplotype genealogy .

nucleotide diversity and population genetic structure
there was genetic variation in the ache <dig> gene among the invasive colorado potato beetle populations  . genetic diversity tended to be higher in north america than in europe for both ache <dig> and dp <dig>  but this was statistically significant only for haplotype diversity . in general, genetic diversity was highest in the us and in the mexican puebla populations, and lowest, especially for the ache <dig>  in the other two mexican populations . diversity did not differ among european populations . as for jhe-b, there were no significant differences in genetic diversity between north american and european populations . there were no significant differences in diversity indices among genes . for mexican morelos and oaxaca populations, diversity tended to be lowest in the ache <dig> gene and highest in the jhe-b gene .

the amova analysis on ache <dig>  pd <dig> and jhe-b sequences showed significant population genetic structure among regions   as well as among populations within regions  . among-region variation accounted for most of the genetic variation for ache <dig>  and jhe-b  genes while within-population variation accounted for most of the genetic variation for dp <dig> . although, the number of us populations analysed is lower than that of europe, these differences are large enough that additional sampling would be unlikely to influence our results. no isolation by distance was detected among european populations. pairwise Φst values for the three loci showed that, in general, the mexican and the us populations were genetically distinct from european populations, and mexican populations were genetically distinct from the us populations . there were few exceptions. there was no significant genetic differentiation between the colorado and the estonian populations for ache <dig> . and the kansas and colorado populations were not genetically different from the estonian and italian populations for dp <dig> . in mexico, the puebla population was genetically different from the morelos and oaxaca populations while the latter two populations showed no significant genetic differentiation . in the us, the colorado population was genetically different from the native kansas population  only for ache <dig>  in contrast to north america, the pairwise Φst values showed only a few significant differences among european populations, with the finnish population being genetically differentiated most often. there was a high correlation between Φststatistics among populations with the three genes .

significant Φst values are indicated in bold.

neutrality tests
in general, european and the north american populations were in hardy-weinberg equilibrium , except for the mexican morelos and oaxaca populations for ache <dig>  oaxaca and estonian population for dp <dig>  and oaxaca and russian populations for jhe-b . in general, the mexican populations showed no strong deviations from neutrality expectations for all genes . tajima’s d and fu and li’s d* were mostly close to zero or slightly positive. neither us population showed strong deviations from neutrality expectations, colorado had consistently negative and kansas positive d and d* values. european populations showed some deviation from neutrality expectations, especially for the ache <dig> gene: all neutrality tests were significant for the finnish and italian populations while one of the tests was significant for russia and estonia . all neutrality tests for the dp <dig> gene were significant for the polish population while only one was significant for finland and italy. there were no strong deviations from neutrality expectations for the jhe-b gene. in contrast to north american populations, most european populations had strong positive neutrality  values, indicating an excess of intermediate-frequency variants. an exception was the dp <dig> gene for which the russian population had slightly negative  values . when european populations were pooled, both tajima’s d  and kelly’s zns  were significant when recombination was included in the coalescence simulations.

discussion
contrary to the expectation that the pattern of genetic variability at the ache <dig> gene would have been shaped by intense insecticide selection, we found that all genetic variability was associated with the insecticide resistance-associated s291g mutation and that the frequency of this mutation was very high both in the native mexican and kansas populations and in the agricultural population in us, though lower in europe . this lower frequency of s291g among european populations is most likely explained by founder effects associated with the species invasion of europe  rather than fitness costs of op resistance in the absence of selection
 <cit> . all three loci showed comparable level of genetic variability with reduced levels of variability in europe compared to us. there results suggest that pre-invasion history and demographic forces have strongly influenced the evolution of the ache <dig> locus in the invasive colorado potato beetles.

the high frequency of the insecticide resistance-associated s291g mutation in the native beetle populations together with a high number of substantially differentiated haplotypes  suggest that the glycine form of ache <dig> is the ancestral state. this high frequency of s291g could be related to the native beetles’ adaptation to wild solanaceous plants which, in general, have higher concentrations of steroidal alkaloids than commercial potato plants
 <cit> . steroidal alkaloids inhibit ache enzyme and beetle ache has been shown to be less sensitive to these alkaloids than that of other insects
 <cit> . thus, most of the observed genetic variation  could be related to the beetle’s historical association with alkaloids which caused a pre-adaptation to withstand op insecticides. support for this possibility comes from a study on museum samples of blowflies, lucilia cuprina, in which hartley et al. <cit>  suggested that rapid evolution of op resistance  was possible due to a high frequency of resistance alleles before the onset of op selection.

the unexpected high allelic variation in the ache <dig> gene in addition to the ancestral origin could be due to recombination or to multiple origins of resistance-associated mutations as suggested in the case of tribolium castaneum resistance to cyclodiene insecticide
 <cit> . the recombination analysis indicated several recombination events in both the north american and european samples  and gard indicated the presence of a recombination breakpoint in the middle of the ache <dig> fragment. the portion of the ache <dig> gene after the recombination breakpoint, which is linked to the resistance-associated mutation s291g, showed less allelic variability than the portion before the recombination breakpoint . this either indicates that selection by ops could have reduced genetic variability but the variability was subsequentially enhanced by recombination creating the high variability among haplotypes or the portion of the gene linked to the s291g mutation is most constrained. the possibility of multiple origins is difficult to determine since only two susceptible haplotypes have been retained by european and north american populations.

it should be noted that under a scenario in which a beneficial mutation is already relatively common at the onset of positive selection , the pattern of genetic variation may differ markedly from the classical signature of positive selection
 <cit> , not for example, leading to substantial reduction in genetic diversity . this may partly explain why no clear signs of insecticide selection at the ache <dig> locus were observed and most allelic variation at the ache <dig> gene in the invasive beetle populations was associated with the resistance-associated mutation. in contrast, for example, in invasive olive fly, bactrocera oleae, the amount of genetic variation of the mediterranean populations was reduced in areas of high op usage with two resistant haplotypes reaching proportions above 60%
 <cit> .

although the s291g mutation in the ache <dig> gene has been associated with op resistance in the colorado potato beetle
 <cit> , the intensity of op selection targeting the s291g mutation may have not been as strong as expected. one reason could be that ache <dig> may not be the major gene conferring op insecticide resistance. in a recent paper revuelta et al. <cit>  found that the colorado potato beetle has a second ache gene that is homologous to the ache <dig> of other insects which in some instance has been found to be the main target of op selection
 <cit> . moreover, associations between the resistance s291g mutation and the resistant level of beetle populations have not been very strong
 <cit> . nevertheless, the site-directed mutagenesis has confirmed that the s291g mutation affects the sensitivity of the enzyme to op insecticides
 <cit>  and thus the ache <dig> gene cannot be totally neutral.

additionally, negative cross-sensitivity and the fact that the sensitivity of insect ache to various inhibitors depends on different combinations of several other point mutations at the locus
 <cit>  means that selection pressures by op insecticides and other inhibitors that target ache may select for different point mutations or combinations of mutations at the ache locus, adding further complexity to the evolutionary history of the locus. for instance, kinetic analyses have indicated that the r30k mutation, in combination with the s291g, enhances ache <dig> insensitivity in the beetle
 <cit> , whereas a second  mutation modifies the ache <dig> to be susceptible to organophosphates . the exact mechanisms responsible for the mutations’ resistance enhancement/reduction are still unknown. the r30k resistance-associated mutation was very rare in our sample  and found only in colorado  indicating either that the mutation is relatively new or is counter-selected due to the fitness costs
 <cit> . unfortunately, the ache <dig> sequence we amplified did not include the whole gene, including the i392t mutation, and thus we could not examine the presence of this mutation and other possible mutations elsewhere at the locus. we found another relatively common non-synonymous mutation  previously not-described which was fixed in mexican morelos and oaxaca populations. it is unlikely that this mutation affects the function of ache <dig> as both tyrosine and phenylalanine have closely similar chemical properties. it is also noted that selection by ops may have also targeted other resistance mechanisms e.g. enhanced detoxification , which may complicate the situation even further.

the higher frequency of susceptible haplotypes  among the invasive agricultural populations in colorado and europe is intriguing. it could be explained by a relaxation of selection by the original host plant  when the beetle expanded its host range onto cultivated potatoes. in other words, serine form of ache <dig> would be the derived form. an interesting scenario, albeit still hypothetical in the light of this data, is that the switch to commercial potato could have counter-selected the glycine form of ache <dig>  whereas the later usage of op insecticides could have selected for the s291g mutation restoring the frequency of the ancestral genotype. a historical survey of the frequency of the s291g mutation could reveal whether this hypothesis is true.

the level of genetic variation in the ache <dig> gene  was about three times higher than the mtdna variability in the same populations
 <cit> , but similar to that found in the other two nuclear genes, dp <dig> and jhe-b. there was a high correlation between Φst statistics among populations with the three genes indicating that all three have been affected by similar evolutionary forces. the north american populations were highly genetically differentiated from each other for all three loci examined. the agricultural population in colorado showed high diversity, similar to the population in kansas collected on s. rostratum. the two populations also shared several haplotypes for all genes analysed suggesting that the switch to potatoes resulted in a large founder population and/or multiple host expansions occurred. the european populations instead showed a strong founder event with a considerable reduction in the genetic variability at all loci . compared to the north american population, european beetles have lost rare variants and rare mutations , which is typical for populations that have experienced a founder event
 <cit> . the bottleneck experienced during the invasion of europe may also explain the lack of structure among the european populations. in addition to the founder event, the surfing of a few variants on the wave front of the expanding invasive population, reaching relatively high frequencies, could explain the lower genetic variability in europe
 <cit> . these general conclusions are unlikely to be changed by additional sampling. sampling additional populations in europe would unlikely lead to an accumulation of additional haplotypes. although we had only one agricultural population analysed from us, this was the most variable population according to an aflp and mtdna survey
 <cit> . furthermore, our results are also in agreement with those obtained with aflps and mtdna
 <cit>  where more populations in us were sampled. finally, the differences in the distribution of genetic variation among and within regions are large enough that additional sampling would be unlikely to influence our results.

CONCLUSIONS
examining both native and invasive pest populations can provide important insights on the origins of insecticide resistance mutations and how selection and demographic events modify patterns of genetic variability
 <cit> . here, we have shown that despite the long history of organophosphate  use in the invasive colorado potato beetle populations, the genetic variability in the ache <dig> gene associated with resistance to op insecticides has been strongly influenced by the pre-invasion history of the species and demographic events. the high frequency of the s291g mutation in the ache <dig> gene among native populations suggests this mutation is the ancestral state and thus, either a pre-adaptation of the beetle for op resistance or alternatively ache <dig> is not the main gene conferring op resistance. the present high genetic variability at the ache <dig> gene could be due to the enduring relationship with host plant alkaloids before the onset of insecticide use and possibly due to recombination events. the genetic diversity in the ache <dig> locus of european beetles strongly reflects founder effects followed by rapid invasion. our study is a snapshot of the genetic variation as it involves only three genes. it is therefore possible that selection by op insecticides could show signature elsewhere in the genome. the new omics techniques will allow to test variation as well function of genes and genes network, and thus reveal the effects of insecticide selection at the whole genome level.
