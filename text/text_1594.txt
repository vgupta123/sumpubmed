BACKGROUND
the transport of retinoids and fatty acids between the retinal pigment epithelium  and retina is critical to photoreceptor development, structure and function. the exchange of visual cycle retinoids and possibly fatty acids between these two cell layers is mediated by interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein  . irbp is the most abundant protein component of the interphotoreceptor matrix, the extracellular material separating the rpe and retina. in contrast to most retinoid-binding proteins, which are present in a wide variety of tissues, irbp is expressed uniquely by cells of photoreceptor origin  <cit> .

within the matrix irbp may have several roles in mediating the transport of retinoids in the visual cycle. by binding retinoids, irbp solubilizes all-trans retinol and 11-cis retinal while protecting these retinoids from isomeric and oxidative degradation  <cit> . irbp also appears to support the removal of all-trans retinol from bleached outer segments  <cit> , delivery of all-trans retinol from rods to the rpe  <cit> , and the transfer of 11-cis retinal from the rpe to the rods  <cit> . finally, irbp may have an important although little-understood role in retinal development  <cit> , and fatty acid trafficking  <cit> .

irbp is large  compared to other retinoid-binding proteins  <cit> . for example, serum retinol-binding protein is  <dig> kda . irbp's size is partly due to the fact that its gene is composed of multiple homologous repeats. each repeat codes for a module of ~ <dig> amino acid residues. mammalian and avian irbps are composed of  <dig> modules. in contrast, teleost irbps contain only two modules  <cit> . in all vertebrate classes examined to date, irbp's three introns are located in the repeat coding for the c-terminal module. this suggests that irbp arose through the quadruplication of an ancestral gene composed of  <dig> exons  <cit> .

the african clawed frog, xenopus laevis, offers unique advantages to studies of irbp structure and function. the large size of its photoreceptors facilitates morphological analysis, and its eyecups are metabolically active for extended periods  <cit> . unlike other amphibians, the xenopus retina can be detached in both light- and dark-adapted animals. remarkably, the detached retina may be re-constituted allowing the introduction of molecules into the adult subretinal space  <cit> . molecules may also be introduced into the embryonic subretinal space through optic vesicle injections  <cit> . one of the most exciting advances is that the xenopus retina is particularly amenable to transgenic manipulation  <cit> . finally, x-ray crystallographic studies have recently determined the structure of the second module of xenopus irbp  <cit> . this advance taken together with the genetic and cellular advantages of xenopus as an experimental system promise to uncover the mechanism of irbps function in the retina.

here, we isolated and sequenced a full-length cdna for xenopus irbp, and used this gene to express the individual modules, double modules, and the full-length xenopus irbp in e. coli. we generated atomic models of modules  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> by homology modeling and docked all-trans retinol molecules in all four modules to examine the location and properties of possible ligand-binding sites. our main finding is that although in terms of function and evolution the modules appear to represent fundamental units of irbp, each module contains two qualitatively different ligand-binding domains. furthermore, the corresponding domains between modules have different biochemical properties and non-identical local structures. finally, interactions between the modules will likely provide important information toward understanding the structure of irbp and its role in the visual cycle.

RESULTS
molecular cloning and sequence analysis
using a human irbp cdna as a probe, we previously isolated by low stringency hybridization screening a xenopus irbp cdna  corresponding to the fourth  module of the protein  <cit> . here, xenb <dig> was used to screen under high stringency conditions a stage  <dig> xenopus cdna library enriched for full-length transcripts. the longest irbp cdna isolated  was  <dig>  base pairs in length. this is consistent with northern blot studies showing that the mrna for xenopus irbpis approximately  <dig>  kb in size  <cit> . the partial length xenb <dig>  and full-length xen10a cdnas are shown diagrammatically in figure  <dig> together with their sequencing strategies.

xen10a codes for a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acid residues . the entire protein without its signal peptide has a calculated molecular mass of  <dig> da. the sequence begins with a stretch of  <dig> n-terminal residues  with features characteristics of signal recognition peptides  <cit> . the initiating methionine is followed by two amino acid residues, which have a net positive charge, and a hydrophobic domain ending in several polar residues.

following the signal peptide, the cdna sequence consists of four homologous consecutive "repeats". each repeat codes for a "module" of ~ <dig> amino acid residues . all of the amino acid residues of xenopus irbp, excluding the signal peptide and the c-terminal four residues, can be assigned to one of the four homologous regions. this is illustrated in the dot-plot diagram of xenopus irbp compared to itself . the overall structure of xenopus irbp is therefore similar to that of mammalian irbps which are also composed of four modules, and different from that of teleosts which contain only two modules. the relationship between the primary structure of human, bovine, xenopus, goldfish and zebrafish irbps is shown by the distance tree in figure 3b. the distance segment separating teleost and xenopus irbps is considerably longer than that between xenopus and mammalian irbps. the longer distance is due in part to the fact that teleost irbp consists of only two modules. xenopus irbp is placed with a high level of confidence between that of mammals and teleosts in accordance with known phylogenetic relationships.

the phylogenetic relationship between each of the irbp modules is shown in figure  <dig>  panela of this figure shows the phylogenetic distances between the various modules of xenopus irbp. the tree was rooted with module  <dig>  the ancestral module  <cit> . the tree demonstrates that modules  <dig> and  <dig> are more closely related to each other than either is to modules  <dig> or  <dig>  irbp modules from different animals are compared by the unrooted distance tree in figure 4b. the central branch point had a boot-strap value less than  <dig> and was collapsed into polytomy. a distance tree constructed with the neighbor method gave the same general topography, except at the central branch point. a parsimony analysis also produced a tree with the same topography. each of the xenopus irbp modules was most similar to the correspondingly numbered module of bovine and human irbps. in contrast, when compared to goldfish and zebrafish irbps, the fourth module of xenopus and mammalian irbps were most similar to the second module of irbp in teleosts . the n-terminal modules always showed the highest similarity between themselves in all of the species examined . these observations are consistent with the suggestion that the middle two modules of teleost irbp were lost during the evolution of the ray-finned fish   <cit> .

searches of the genpept database with consecutive residue fragments of the xenopus irbp sequence showed a high level of similarity with other irbps in the database. in addition, each of the modules showed similarity with c-terminal processing proteases   <cit> , and enoyl-coa hydratases   <cit>  . these observations taken together with x-ray crystallographic data from the second module of xenopus irbp suggest that irbp belongs to the cpta/crotonase superfamily, and shares with other members of the family a common ligand-binding domain to stabilize unique hydrophobic molecules  <cit> .

a glycosylation consensus site is present in modules  <dig> and  <dig> . this observation is consistent with the fact that bovine irbp contains asparagine-linked sialoligosaccharides  <cit> . glycosylation differences between species could explain why xenopus irbp   <cit>  has a faster electrophoretic mobility on sds-page compared to that of bovine irbp   <cit> . the role of irbp's sugar moieties, which appear unnecessary for its elongated shape, secretion, or ability to bind retinoids, is presently unknown  <cit> .

the 3'-untranslated region of xenopus irbp, which is considerably shorter than that of mammalian irbps, contains two typical polyadenylation signal sequences . the use of alternative signal sequences for in irbp has been shown in the rat retina where two irbp mrnas of different lengths are expressed  <cit> . the significance of these observations to regulating irbp mrna stability is largely unknown.

full-length xenopus irbp: expression, retinol protection and binding parameters for all-trans retinol and 11-cis retinaldehyde
a remarkable characteristic of the irbp-thioredoxin fusion proteins generated in this study was that they could be expressed to a significant extent in a soluble and biochemically active form in e. coli. the use of thioredoxin as a fusion partner was previously found to significantly enhance the soluble expression of x4irbp  <cit>  compared to x4irbp without thioredoxin  <cit> . here, we found that this effect could be extended to the other modules, and to the full-length xenopus irbp as well. a variety of proteins ranging from receptors to enzymes have been expressed in a soluble and active form as thioredoxin fusion proteins  <cit> . we found that optimizing the induction temperature can further enhance the expression of irbp in the cytosol over that in the insoluble fraction. this effect, which is related to the reduced aggregation of recombinant proteins at lower expression temperatures, has been used to improve the solubility of a variety proteins in e. coli . although the lower temperatures required extended incubation times, the final quantity of recombinant protein produced remained approximately the same as that generated at 37°c. the optimum incubation times and temperatures are given in table  <dig>  the recombinant proteins were purified by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, and arsenical and ni2+-affinity chromatography.

the xenopus-irbp fusion protein, which is to our knowledge represents the first full-length irbp generated in a prokaryotic system, binds and stabilizes visual-cycle retinoids. in figure  <dig> the absorbance of the protein with bound all-trans retinol is monitored at  <dig> nm  as a function of time. over  <dig> min., only a small drop in absorbance was appreciated. this ability to maintain the absorbance at  <dig> nm is characteristic of bovine irbp, and may be related to an activity in maintaining the oxidation state of retinol  <cit> .

the binding parameters of retinoid-binding proteins including irbp may be determined by fluorescence spectroscopy. the method utilizes changes in quantum yield occurring during ligand binding  <cit> . such changes are represented by enhancement of ligand fluorescence, quenching of intrinsic protein fluorescence, and transfer of energy from protein to bound ligand. fluorescence enhancement occurs if the quantum yield of the ligand's fluorescence is higher in the hydrophobic environment of the ligand-binding domain compared to that outside of the domain.

we were interested in asking whether xenopus irbp or its individual modules  can discriminate between all-trans retinol and 11-cis retinaldehyde. compared to studies using retinol, monitoring 11-cis retinaldehyde binding is more challenging as it is not significantly fluorescent precluding measurements of fluorescence enhancement. however, its binding can be measured by following protein quenching, and its ability to displace all-trans retinol. figure 8a shows a titration of 11-cis retinaldehyde to the full-length xenopus irbp monitoring protein quenching. the number of binding sties were calculated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  with a kd 11-cis =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm .

in figure 8b, full-length xenopus irbp was titrated with all-trans retinol in the presence of different fixed concentrations of 11-cis retinaldehyde. binding of all-trans retinol to xenopus irbp was followed by monitoring the enhancement of its fluorescence. note that increasing the concentration 11-cis retinaldehyde resulted in a reduction in the level of all-trans retinol fluorescence enhancement . equation  <dig>  was used to analyze the data generating the 3-dimensional representation of the fit shown graphically in figure 8b. the number of binding sites was calculated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  with kd all-trans =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and kd 11-cis =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm .

expression and ligand-binding properties of the individual xenopus-irbp modules
saturable binding for one to two all-trans retinol equivalents could be detected for each module. often fewer sites were detected by titrations following ligand quenching of protein fluorescence compared to that monitoring retinol-fluorescence enhancement. this is because quenching requires the presence of a tryptophan in the ligand-binding domain. in contrast, this residue is not required to support ligand-fluorescence enhancement. the binding parameters for all-trans retinol derived from enhancement and quenching titrations are shown in table  <dig> for each module, and the full-length xenopus irbp. the equilibrium dissociation constants ranged from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  . monitoring fluorescence enhancement, two sites could be detected in modules  <dig> and  <dig> .  <dig>  ±  <dig>  were detected in module  <dig>  in contrast, only one site  could be detected in module  <dig>  fewer sites were detected in titrations monitoring quenching. for modules  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  less than one site was detected. only for module ii was a full site detected by quenching . thus, as with the full-length xenopus irbp, fewer of the ligand-binding domains could be detected by fluorescence quenching compared to assays monitoring retinol fluorescence enhancement.

the binding of 11-cis retinaldehyde was characterized by competition with all-trans retinol . the binding parameters for all-trans retinol were similar with those in table  <dig> except for module  <dig> where the kd was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm in the absence of 11-cis retinaldehyde. the reason for this difference is not clear, but may represent an allosteric interaction in this module.

for the individual modules and full-length xenopus irbp, the equilibrium dissociation constants for all-trans retinol, and 11-cis retinaldehyde were similar except for module  <dig>  here, the kd for all-trans retinol and 11-cis retinaldehyde were significantly different . this suggests that module  <dig> has selectivity for all-trans retinol over 11-cis retinaldehyde. molecular modeling studies described below, indicate that the putative sites may provide highly ordered environments perhaps discriminating between the isomeric configuration, oxidative state, or both of the ligand. ongoing studies will address these possibilities by preparing crystals of x2irbp with bound ligand.

why do the number of sites from individual modules add up to more than that detected in the full-length irbp? here we asked whether the number of sites within individual modules could at least predict the number in recombinant proteins consisting of two modules. we had originally anticipated that the sum of sites from individual modules would give the number in such "module pairs". however, this turned out to be not always true. we expressed and purified module combinations 1& <dig> and 3& <dig>  termed xirbp and xirbp respectively. binding of all-trans retinol to these module pairs was characterized by fluorometric titrations monitoring retinol-fluorescence enhancement . for xirbp, n =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . in contrast, n for xirbp was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sites . these results are consistent with the notion that some of the sites within individual modules are cryptic in the intact full-length irbp. that is, some sites may not be solvent exposed in the intact irbp as they are within individual modules. interestingly, the affinity for retinol was greater in the module pair compared to that in the individual module. the kd's for modules  <dig> and  <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. in contrast, the kd for xirbp was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm. similarly, the kd 's for modules  <dig> and  <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm respectively. in contrast, the kd for xirbp was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm. these observations suggest that the presence of more than one module may be required for the specificity of individual ligand-binding domains. since the existing x-ray crystal structure of irbp is limited to only a single module , we do not know the quaternary structure, or how the modules fit together to form the intact full-length irbp. therefore it is plausible that some binding sites that are solvent exposed in the individual module are buried in the intact module. to address this question, ongoing studies in our laboratories are aimed at determining the x-ray crystal structure of irbps composed of multiple modules.

to further characterize the recombinant xenopus irbp and it modules, the fluorescent stearic acid analog, 9- stearic acid  was used as a probe . 9-as has been previously used to study the fatty-acid binding properties of native bovine irbp  <cit> . monitoring the enhancement of 9-as fluorescence upon binding to the full-length xenopus irbp showed  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sites with kd =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm. although similar to the affinity for all-trans retinol , the number of sites detected with retinol was somewhat greater  . interestingly, the number of sites detected by monitoring protein quenching with all-trans retinol  was also greater than that detected by quenching with 9-as . surprisingly, most of the individual modules had a similar binding capacity for 9-as compared to that of the full-length protein . this suggests the possibility that the fewer sites detected with 9-as compared to that with all-trans retinol in the full-length xenopus irbp is due to the loss of a site typically supporting both fluorescence enhancement and quenching in the individual module. such a site appears to be present in the individual modules, but can no longer be probed with 9-as in the full-length xenopus irbp. ongoing structural studies of the full-length irbp should help to define the relationship of these ligand-binding sites in the full-length irbp.

ligand docking and homology modeling
as structural data are not available for any of the modules besides that of x2irbp, we used homology modeling to compare the structures of the individual modules. first, molecular docking was used to predict the location of the all-trans retinol binding sties in the known x2irbp structure. the site finder routine identified the largest two cavities to have sizes  <dig> and  <dig> . automated docking procedure and conformational analysis yielded two best scoring poses for all-trans retinol, one at each site. these poses are shown in figure  <dig>  in this figure, a docked molecule of all-trans retinol is colored grey in site i, and blue in site ii. site i, which is described by residues ile <dig>  val <dig>  phe <dig>  phe <dig>  gln <dig>  phe <dig>  ala <dig>  ile <dig>  leu <dig>  ala <dig>  ile <dig>  val <dig>  trp <dig>  ala <dig>  leu <dig>  leu <dig>  tyr <dig> and leu <dig>  is highly hydrophobic and consists of residues residing almost entirely within the n-terminal a domain  <cit> . however, site ii, delineated by residues pro <dig>  arg <dig>  val <dig>  lys <dig>  asp <dig>  thr <dig>  leu <dig>  ser <dig>  gly <dig>  met <dig>  his <dig>  ser <dig>  val <dig>  thr <dig>  leu <dig>  gly <dig> and gly <dig>  has a number of polar side chains and is situated at the interface between the a and the c-terminal b domains  <cit> . site ii, the hydrophobic region between the two domains was previously thought to represent the putative ligand-binding site within x2irbp  <cit> . both sites i and ii have a nearby trp residue, conserved among the functional units. it is therefore possible that both sites could support protein quenching.

for modeling structures of x1-, x3- and x4irbp modules by homology, the x2irbp crystal structure was selected by moe as the best candidate through its automated pdb database search and sequence alignment routines. figure 11a shows the overall superimposed modeled structures of modules x1-, x3-, and x4irbp with the experimental x2irbp structure. overall, the superposition demonstrates high homology among three-dimensional structures of all four modules, particularly among the α helices and β sheets. furthermore, from the superimposed structures it is clear that each module retains the locations of both of the two cavities described above as the putative ligand-binding sites predicted from the ligand-docking analysis .

the amino acid residues that line each of these cavities are summarized in table  <dig>  this table lists the residues that are conserved in the putative ligand-binding pockets between each module, and those that are chemically different and/or would be predicted to sterically hinder retinol entry compared to the corresponding amino acid residue in x2irbp. upon comparing the domains, it is apparent that not only are sites i and ii distinct, but the corresponding sites in four modules also appear to display some differences. first, site i has a significantly more hydrophobic character compared to site ii. secondly, site ii, which has a higher percentage of polar residues, shows a more open binding pocket with less conservation of the residues contributing to the ligand-binding domain compared to site i.

structural differences between the sites in different modules are apparent upon comparing the amino acid residues contributing to these two putative ligand-binding sites. in particular, at several positions, residues within site i of x2irbp have been replaced by bulkier residues. leu <dig> has been replaced by phenylalanines in modules  <dig> and  <dig> , which cause steric clash with the modeled retinol molecules. it is, thus, likely that in modules x3irbp and x4irbp, site i for retinol binding does not exist. a difference at this position is also noted for module  <dig> where the corresponding leu <dig> has been replaced by val <dig> 

site ii, which is formed as a cleft between domains a and b on antiparallel β-sheets between residues  <dig> and  <dig>  and the loop between residues and  <dig> and  <dig>  also shows differences among modules. residues of other modules that may interfere with the entry of retinol into site ii are x1irbp, leu65; x3irbp, glu <dig>  leu77; x4irbp, phe <dig>  arg <dig>  another notable difference is that the loop in module  <dig> between pro <dig> and pro <dig> has a conformation different from those in modules x <dig>  x <dig> and x <dig>  in x1irbp the loop has moved into the site ii ligand-binding pocket. finally, the loop between amino acid residues  <dig> to  <dig> in x3irbp is dissimilar compared to the corresponding loops in the other three modules.

discussion
irbp's structure consisting of internal homologous modules is unprecedented for a hydrophobic ligand-binding protein  <cit> . extra- and intracellular retinoid-binding proteins typically do not have significant internal homology with duplication of ligand-binding domains, and bind only one ligand equivalent per polypeptide  <cit> . this is also generally true of the fatty acid-binding proteins, and other members of the calycin superfamily  <cit> . it is possible that irbp's interesting module structure is related to the profound complexity of vitamin a trafficking in vision compared to other biological systems requiring extracellular retinoid transport. for example, serum retinol-binding protein transports only one chemical type of retinoid, all-trans retinol, in a unidirectional manner from the liver to the rpe. in contrast, irbp is thought to mediate the bidirectional transport of several retinoid types  between four cell types . it is therefore plausible that irbp's module structure may have a role in targeting the correct retinoid to the intended cell type while protecting it from isomeric and oxidative degradation. our long-term goal is to uncover the relationship between the structure and function of irbp in the visual cycle. here, we focused on the xenopus irbp homolog because an x-ray crystal structure is available for the second module in this species  <cit> . furthermore, we anticipate that xenopus will provide a valuable system to study the function and trafficking of irbp in the retina using transgenic approaches.

the translated amino acid sequence of xenopus irbp begins with a signal peptide suggesting that the synthesis of the nascent irbp begins with its insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum. furthermore, n-terminal sequencing of irbp from several species indicates that the signal peptide is cleaved at a limited number of sites. although n-terminal sequence data of native xenopus irbp is not available, frog irbp is known to have a  <dig> amino acid residue extension  <cit> . the same cleavage position would be predicted for the xenopus irbp signal peptide  <cit> . the above observations are consistent with immunohistochemical and biochemical studies showing that xenopus irbp accumulates in the ipm following its synthesis by the rods and cones  <cit> .

western blot studies have shown that native xenopus irbp   <cit>  is closer in size to irbps in mammals   <cit>  than to that in teleost fish   <cit> . these observations are explained by the present finding that xenopus irbp is composed of  <dig> homologous segments each consisting of ~ <dig> amino acid residues.

the xenopus irbp modules are related in specific ways to each other and to known irbps. comparing the xenopus modules to themselves,  <dig> &  <dig>  and  <dig> &  <dig> are more similar to each other. a model to explain this relationship begins with the proposal that the irbp gene arose through the insertion of a reverse transcribed processed mrna 5' to the original gene  <cit> . after this first duplication event, the amino acid sequences of the two resulting modules diverged. a second duplication event occurring in the same way as the first could explain why similar and dissimilar modules alternate with one another  <cit> . that is, a reverse transcribed processed mrna was inserted 5' to the two repeat irbp. this second duplication probably occurred before, or early during the emergence of vertebrates since the size of skate and ray irbps suggests that irbp in elasmobranchs is composed of  <dig> modules  <cit> . the quadruplication therefore occurred before the emergence of bony fish  since cartilaginous fish , which include elasmobranchs, diverged before the emergence of the bony fish  <cit> . the dimodular teleost irbp would then represent the loss of two repeats during the emergence of the ray finned fish . the similarity of the n- and c-terminal modules of teleost irbp with that of xenopus and mammals suggests that it was the middle two repeats that were lost. the deletion probably occurred by homologous recombination, a common mechanism for the elimination of dna segments during the evolution of complex proteins  <cit> . this model could be tested by examining irbps of extant early actinopterygii, the sarcopterygii fish , and the jawless fish .

the above model suggests that the irbp modules contain an important function that was copied during the evolution of its gene. similar yet non-identical repeats, suggests that the duplication events allowed for functional divergence. we therefore anticipated that each module should have functional activity, yet this activity would not be identical between modules. to study the modules independently, we expressed them separately, as pairs, and as the full-length protein.

full-length recombinant xenopus irbp had the expected biochemical properties although the number of binding sites was somewhat higher than that of native bovine irbp. previous studies of bovine irbp have reported values for n ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  sites per polypeptide. a more recent study found evidence for  <dig> ligand-binding sites in bovine irbp  <cit> . this is consistent with the present study where we detected  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sites in xenopus irbp.

surface hydrophobicity representations of x2irbp call attention to two hydrophobic regions representing candidate ligand-binding domains  <cit> . evidence that at least one of these domains  may have biological significance comes from its structural homology with the active site of crotonases  <cit> . superimposition of the structure of x2irbp with that of 2-enoyl-coa hydratase complexed with octanoyl-coa suggests that site ii in irbp corresponds to the crotonase ligand-binding domain  <cit> . although the precise biological function of site ii in irbp is not established, molecular docking analysis placed a molecule of all-trans retinol into its large shallow cleft. interestingly, the docking analysis also positioned an all-trans retinol molecule within the more deeply buried n-terminal hydrophobic domain of site i. these observations are consistent with studies showing that in bovine irbp, retinol is stabilized mainly by hydrophobic interactions  <cit> . nevertheless, there is evidence from the structure of site i that retinol's oh group could form a hydrogen bond to lys <dig> located nearby on the surface of x2irbp. finally, our data are consistent with studies of human irbp showing that each module has one to two ligand-binding sites  <cit> .

our homology modeling studies suggest that the two putative ligand-binding sites identified by x-ray crystallography of x2irbp are conserved in each of the other three modules of irbp. although the significance of the specific details awaits further experimental data, we can say that the two sites based on their overall morphology and local environment are structurally distinct and may therefore have significantly different functions. it is highly likely that not all four modules are involved in the same functional role of ligand-binding and/or transportation with similar efficiency. the amount of fluorescence enhancement is different for the various modules. the modules are also not equivalent in terms of their dissociation constants. the range of kd all-trans s could reflect unique demands of the visual cycle for supporting different levels of extracellular all-trans retinol flux occurring during scotopic and photopic conditions. of particular interest is the apparent specificity of module  <dig> for all-trans retinol over 11-cis retinaldehyde. taken together, our results suggest that the entire polypeptide chain possibly functions as a single protein with multiple modules performing various tasks of binding, protection and transportation of ligands, or yet another unknown role. finally, one or both binding-sites may border other modules in the full-length irbp. thus, physiologically triggered changes in the quaternary structure of irbp may allow significant changes in the availability of specific ligand-binding domains.

CONCLUSIONS
irbp has a remarkable structure consisting of repeats or modules of which there are four in xenopus. this structure is probably critical to understanding the role of irbp in the complicated physiology of retinoid trafficking between rods, cones, rpe, and müller cells in the visual cycle. our studies suggest that the module structure not only provides for increased ligand carrying capacity, but also allows for qualitative differences in the affinity, and specificity of the binding domains within the individual modules. finally, although the modules may represent functional units of the protein, our studies suggest that important interactions between the modules may be critical to understanding the structure and function of the ligand-binding domains.
