BACKGROUND
wnts are secreted cysteine rich glycoprotein ligands that transduce their signal through at least three distinct pathways  <cit> . the wnt/β-catenin pathway  is the best studied and arises from an increase in non-phosphorylated intracellular β-catenin content, transport to the cell nucleus and association with members of the tcf/lef transcription factor family to drive target gene expression  <cit> . wnts are involved in a number of developmental processes including the establishment of cell fate, proliferation, and differentiation  <cit> . in mice, wnt <dig> is associated with female sexual differentiation  <cit>  and is required during emergence of the female gonad to prevent formation of the male-specific coelomic blood vessel and steroidogenic cell migration  <cit> . in addition to wnt <dig>  sex-specific expression has been found for wnt5awnt <dig> and wnt9a within the gonad  <cit> . recent findings also implicate a family of secreted ligands  in female sex-determination  <cit> . the r-spondins  play an essential role in ovarian development through stabilization of cytoplasmic β-catenin. mutation of rspo <dig> is associated with human sex reversal  <cit> . expression of rspo proteins overlaps with expression of wnts during development indicating a link between rspo and the wnt signaling pathway  <cit> .

while wnts play a key role in embryonic development of the ovary  <cit> , several studies describe the expression of wnts and wnt signaling components in adult rodent ovaries  <cit> . some of these, including wnt <dig> <cit>  and wnt2b <cit> , are associated with activation of canonical wnt signaling. interestingly, wnt2b is expressed in the ovarian surface epithelium   <cit> . ose is a simple epithelium of squamous or cuboidal cells and it, as well as mullerian duct derivatives , are derived from the peritoneal mesothelium  <cit> . functionally, ose is implicated in the ovulatory process and is responsible for repair of the ovulatory wound  <cit> . deregulation of wnt-signaling in ose has been implicated in ovarian tumorigenesis  <cit> .

the spatio-temporal pattern of β-catenin/tcf-signaling activity within murine ose  was investigated using a specific transgenic reporter mice  strain  <cit> . we show that β-catenin/tcf activation identifies a cell population in the mesothelium that overlies the indifferent gonad. by embryonic day   <dig> , the majority of cells in the overlying epithelium of the ovary retain β-catenin/tcf-signaling cells while they disappear in cells covering the testis. at parturition the proportion of signaling to non-signaling mose cells decrease and fall to a small but sustained proportion in adult females. the β-catenin/tcf-signaling population in adult females is enriched for a side population which is believed to be a characteristic of stem cells  <cit> . these observations might explain why ovarian cancers show oviduct/uterine histopathology as ose share an origin with mullerian duct derived reproductive tissues  <cit> .

RESULTS
β-catenin/tcf-activated lacz expression is seen on cells covering the indifferent mouse gonad
prominent lacz+ stained cells overlie the entire medio-lateral surface of the indifferent gonad on embryonic day  <dig>  . coelomic epithelial cells extending beyond the genital ridge towards either the rostral or caudal end of the mesonephros , did not stain indicating that only the mesothelium directly covering the gonad has β-catenin/tcf-mediated signaling. to identify the cell types in which β-catenin/tcf-signaling was activated, paraffin-embedded sections of e <dig>  gonads were examined. somatic  as well as mullerian duct cells of e <dig>  gonads showed lacz expression ; germ cells, distinguished by their large round nuclei, were not stained .

β-catenin/tcf-mediated lacz expression shows sexual dimorphism in the cells covering the developing gonad
gonadal β-catenin/tcf-mediated lacz-expression was examined at later stages of embryonic development. sexual dimorphic patterns of lacz staining were observed at e <dig>  . in e <dig>  females, pronounced staining was observed over the entire gonadal surface while e <dig>  males displayed less extensive staining compared to either the e <dig>  indifferent gonad  or the e <dig>  ovary .

the ovarian surface at e <dig>  maintained extensive lacz expression with a bias towards the cranial pole . in contrast, staining in the e <dig>  testis had almost disappeared with some staining retention at the caudal pole . staining in e <dig>  ovaries was similar to that at e <dig>  with an anterior bias towards the cranial suspensory ligament. e <dig>  testes were devoid of lacz+ cells except for the region near the mesonephric tubules and faint staining at the caudal pole. in e <dig>  ovaries, lacz staining remained prominent while testes were devoid of lacz+ cells with the exception of the mesonephric tubule attachment . in both sexes, lacz staining was present in wolffian  and mullerian  ducts as well as mesonephric tubules . the sex-specific degeneration of the md in the male by e <dig>   is apparent with retention of wd. the female  loses her wd at a later age, generally at e16- <dig> – e <dig>  .

the disappearance of β-catenin/tcf-mediated lacz expression on the surface of developing testes raised the possibility of cell loss and coverage with a tough capsule i.e. establishment of the testicular tunica albuginea. in order to assess this possibility, basement membranes were highlighted by periodic acid-schiff  staining of lacz-stained e <dig>  gonad sections. a thin basement membrane  was observed below ose and the lacz+ and lacz- epithelial cells . germ and pregranulosa cells, organized into structures termed ovigerous cords in developing ovaries  <cit> , were delimited by a thin basement membrane. gonadal surface cells of e <dig>  testis did not stain for lacz expression and appeared more elongated than e <dig>  ose cells . a basement membrane was observed underneath and between the epithelial cells of e <dig>  testis and appeared to thicken at this stage . testis cords consisting of germ and sertoli cells  <cit>  were surrounded by a basement membrane. these observations indicate that the testicular loss of β-catenin/tcf-mediated lacz expression is not due to surface cell elimination.

β-catenin/tcf-mediated lacz expression in mose is heterogeneous during postnatal development
whole-mount lacz staining of ovaries derived from postnatal mice  revealed staining and demonstrated an age-dependent decrease in the relative proportion of stained cells . histological examination of sections derived from p <dig> to p <dig> mice showed staining in the ose  and an age-dependent decrease in lacz+ ose cells. no distribution pattern for lacz+ cells within the ose was detected at these ages.

in order to quantify changes in the proportion of lacz+ to total ose with animal age, cells were isolated from the ovarian surface using an enzymatic procedure and analyzed by flow cytometry. this approach was tested to ensure that ose cells only were released. ovary-encompassing ose was selectively labeled using the water-soluble reagent nhs-biotin. exposure of an intact ovary to the reagent for a brief time interval followed by quenching with excess glycine provides specific ose labeling. tight junctions between ose cells and the presence of a basement membrane prevent the reagent from entering into the ovarian parenchyma  <cit> . indeed, ose cells are labeled specifically with nhs-biotin with minimal penetration into the parenchyma as visualized by the binding of fitc-conjugated avidin to nhs-biotin stained p <dig> ovary .

the efficiency of ose isolation was assessed after subjecting nhs-biotin labeled ovaries to enzymatic treatment. the majority  of the labeled cells were removed and the residual ovary remained relatively intact . facs analysis of the isolated cells showed that approximately 86 ±  <dig> %  of the cells were labeled with avidin-fitc  after enzyme treatment. the proportion of viable cells, assessed by concurrent analysis of cell viability , corresponded with those of unlabeled ose from control ovaries.

after sorting nhs-biotin-labeled cells through facs, cytokeratin  <dig>  detection with cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody was conducted . ovarian section from p <dig> mice was used as a control for the specificity of ck <dig> antibody to ose cells .

since the proportion of ose cells expressing lacz decreased with age, it is possible that β-catenin/tcf expression drives cellular apoptosis. accumulating evidence suggests that β-catenin is involved in cell cycle arrest  <cit>  and apoptosis  <cit> . to investigate this possibility, the occurrence of apoptosis in p <dig> and p <dig> ovaries was analyzed by tunel. the positive control  displayed staining in all cells . there was no evidence of dna fragmentation in p <dig> and p <dig> ovaries , suggesting absence of apoptosis even though significant changes in the proportion of lacz+ cells were seen at these ages .

it was possible that the age-dependent decrease in the proportion of lacz+ cells arose because they were non-replicating. cell proliferation was assessed immunohistochemically after incorporation of the thymidine analog, bromodeoxyuridine , into cellular dna. to enumerate proliferating lacz+ cells, ovaries were collected 48 hr post brdu injection and stained for lacz and brdu . at p <dig>  approximately 25% of lacz+ cells are brdu-labeled but by p <dig> this falls to 8% . this indicates lacz+ cell replication decreases with age. the observation that there is an age-dependent decrease in the number and rate of replication of lacz+ cells raises the possibility that proliferating lacz+ cells give rise to non-signaling cells. to assess this possibility, ose cells from p5-p <dig> were harvested and cultured. in four days, a 2-fold increase in lacz+ cells and a three-fold increase in the number of lacz- cells were obtained . there was, however, no significant difference in proliferation rate between lacz+ and lacz- cells. prolonged culture for 8 days led to a significant decrease in lacz+ cells whereas the number of lacz- cells increased. the latter observation suggests non-signaling cells arose from the previously signaling ones. to further confirm that lacz- arose from their positive counterparts, lacz+ cells were sorted from lacz- cells and cultured separately. after 8-days of culture, the majority of lacz+ cells did not stain for lacz . lacz- cells, however, did not stain for lacz following prolonged culture.

wnt and fzd expression in ose were unchanged with age

lacz+ ose cells are enriched with a potential stem cell population
the observation that there is an age-dependent decrease to relative constancy of β-catenin/tcf-signaling ose cells prompted an examination of whether these cells exhibit a stem cell characteristic termed side population . sp is detected by dual wavelength flow cytometry of the cellular efflux of the dna-binding dyes hoechst  <dig> or dyecycle violet . sp cells appeared as a characteristic tail in the flow cytometry of isolated ose . the sp cells were small round cells of approximately six μm in diameter . the dependence of the sp phenotype on expression of abcg <dig> transporter pump was demonstrated by pre-incubation with the abcg <dig> inhibitor verapamil. the results indicate that while ~  <dig> % ose of prepubertal mice is sp , ~  <dig>  ± 2%  of lacz-positive cells are sp positive. this also indicates that the lacz+ cell population is heterogeneous with potential stem and non-stem cell components.

discussion
transgenic reporter  mice indicate activation of β-catenin/tcf signaling within ose. this dominates the epithelium covering the indifferent gonad and is followed by its maintenance in a sex-specific manner. the majority, most likely all of the cells overlying the differentiating ovary, retain β-catenin/tcf activity, which begins to disappear with testis formation. further ovarian development shows an age-dependent decrease in the proportion of β-catenin/tcf-responsive cells to relative constancy in the mature ovary. rt-pcr analysis detected the expression of multiple wnts and fzds within the ose. side population analysis indicates enrichment in β-catenin/tcf-signaling cells. these findings suggest that β-catenin/tcf signaling cells form the definitive ose and raise the possibility that these signaling cells constitute a putative stem cell population.

β-catenin/tcf-signaling plays critical role in embryonic patterning and cell fate determination in a variety of tissues  <cit> . wilms’ tumor suppressor  <dig>  <cit>  and empty-spiracles homeobox gene  <dig>  <cit>  expressed within the thickening coelomic epithelium of the developing gonad are required for genital ridge development. the presence of a lacz+ cell population overlying the e <dig>  gonad suggests that the mouse gonad may be formed from a β-catenin/tcf-signaling cell population. coelomic epithelial cells migrate into xx and xy gonad and contribute to supporting cell lineage of the gonad  <cit> . the localization of lacz+ cells within e <dig>  gonads raises the possibility that β-catenin/tcf-mediated expression may be involved in differentiation of somatic cells of the developing gonad.

β-catenin is dispensable for testis formation and maintenance whereas it is required for maintenance of ovarian characteristics  <cit> . several genes known to play a role in sexual development are transcribed in a sexually dimorphic fashion  <cit> . we observed sexual dimorphic β-catenin/tcf-mediated expression that is distinct by e <dig> . it is established that the presence of germ cells in female gonads is required for proper development of the ovary  <cit>  and that sexual differentiation and meiotic entry of germ cells in embryonic xx gonads progress in an anterior-to-posterior pattern  <cit> . our analysis demonstrated that lacz expression in ovaries show the opposite wave pattern: an anterior bias observed by e <dig>  and extends to the early postnatal period. this staining pattern wave is similar in its spatial distribution to that of adamts <dig> a marker of ovarian somatic differentiation  <cit>  and raises the possibility that ose differentiation begins posteriorly and moves anteriorly. this pattern of β-catenin/tcf-mediated expression in the xx gonad may be due to a gradient of meiosis promoting substances produced by a fixed source in or near the anterior portion of the ovary. there is some evidence that the ovary in germ cell deficient mice is covered by ose cells  <cit> . thus, the observed ovarian lacz expression pattern is unlikely due to a substance produced by germ cells but could be reflective of local environmental cues that are present in the embryonic female gonad.

sry expression blocks β-catenin-mediated transcription  <cit> . the observation that loss of lacz expression begins at the anterior portion of the developing testis mimicking sry expression suggests that the anterior-posterior loss of lacz on the surface of embryonic testis may be due to sry expression. because sry is not expressed in the coelomic epithelium of a differentiating testis  <cit> , it is unlikely that the loss of lacz is due to sry expression. alternatively, non-cell autonomous paracrine signals such as sox9mis, and dhh emanating from sertoli cells  <cit>  may be responsible for blocking β-catenin/tcf expression. it is possible that active steroidogenesis present in embryonic testis but absent in fetal ovary  <cit>  may be preventing the β-catenin/tcf-pathway from being efficiently expressed in the developing testis.

several methods have been described for isolating ose cells  <cit> . we have established a simple procedure for isolating a relatively pure population of ose cells. this procedure owes its success to the fact that the nhs-biotin label is retained following enzymatic digestion. additionally, biotinylation did not affect ose cell viability. sorted nhs-labeled cells stained for ck <dig> indicating that they were derived from the ose.

some studies support a positive role of β-catenin in cell mitosis  <cit> , whereas others suggest a potential involvement in cell cycle arrest  <cit>  or a direct involvement in apoptosis  <cit> . β-catenin accumulation within the cell nucleus is however involved in cell fate decision  <cit> . we have shown that age-dependent decrease in β-catenin/tcf-signaling cells is not due to the absence of cell proliferation or the result of selective apoptosis. similar studies in day- <dig> and day- <dig> neonatal mouse ovaries reported the absence of apoptosis in all ovarian cell types  <cit> . we suspect that lacz+ cells were quiescent with continued aging and prepared for differentiation. it is likely that upon mitosis, a lacz+ cell looses its ability to signal through the β-catenin/tcf pathway and becomes non-signaling. this was reflected by the loss in proliferative capacity of lacz+ cells from p <dig> to p <dig>  in vitro, lacz+ cells showed a transient increase in cell number followed by appearance of lacz- cells suggesting that loss of lacz expression is due to cellular differentiation. the transient increase in lacz+ cells may originate from symmetric division of lacz+ cells or insufficient downregulation of β-catenin/tcf-lacz expression in vitro following mitosis. the observation that sorted lacz+ cells cultured separately from their non-signaling counterparts gave rise to lacz- cells provides the supporting evidence that loss of lacz expression is due to ose differentiation.

knockout studies of various wnt molecules led to the discovery that wnts perform critical functions during early development of reproductive tissues  <cit> . our studies show expression of various wnt ligands and fzd receptors transcripts within ose. these are similar to previous studies assessing wnt/fzd expression within the ovary  <cit> . among the wnts found to be expressed in the ose are wnt- <dig> and wnt- <dig>  which have been shown to impact ovary development  <cit> . the overlapping expression of multiple wnts within the ose is suggestive of functional redundancy.

gene expression analysis supports the hypothesis that human ose cells are multipotent  <cit> . this hypothesis has recently been validated by a study that described putative stem cells within the ose as cells expressing markers of pluripotency  <cit> . a side population-enriched and label-retaining cell population in the coelomic epithelium of adult mouse ovary has been identified as possible stem/progenitor cells  <cit> . we obtained a distinguishable sp within mouse ose. the observation that the sp is enriched for β-catenin/tcf-signaling cells raises the possibility that lacz-positive cells constitute ose progenitors. the fact that cancer stem cells are a subset defined by increased wnt/β-catenin activity  <cit>  and that wnt/β-catenin is essential for maintenance of intestinal stem cells  <cit>  supports our hypothesis. there is accumulating evidence suggesting that somatic stem cells may undergo mutagenic transformation into cancer stem cells  <cit> . because many of the properties that define somatic stem cells also define cancer stem cells, our identification of a β-catenin/tcf-signaling cell population in ose raises the possibility that endometrioid adenocarcinomas may arise as a result of transformation of the lacz+ cells. the common origin of the β-catenin/tcf-signaling cells with oviduct/uterus may explain the suggestion that ose cancers show uterine/oviductal characteristics  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate that β-catenin/tcf-signaling cells are present early in ose development. the maintenance of a constant number of β-catenin/tcf-signaling cells accompanied by the increase in appearance of non-signaling cells raises the possibility that the original β-catenin/tcf-signaling cells give rise to a replacement as well as an expanding population of non-signaling progeny. taken together, our results indicate that the mouse ose is heterogeneous and may contain a population of progenitor cells. the physiological necessity for restoring ose after ovulations may reflect the need for establishing and maintaining the progenitor cells. it also raises the possibility, specifically in primates, that transformation of ose progenitor cells can generate the varied histopathology observed in ovarian cancer.
