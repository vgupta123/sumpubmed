BACKGROUND
cotton is one of the world’s most important cash crops, and cotton fiber provides an important raw material for the textile industry. there are four cultivated cotton species, including diploids of gossypium herbaceum and g. arboreum and tetraploids of g. hirsutum and g. barbadense. g. hirsutum cottons  are planted widely due to their wide adaptability and high yield. these cottons account for more than 95 % of the world’s cotton production  <cit> .

china is one of the largest cotton producing countries in the world but is not the country of origin for cotton. cotton production and breeding were developed on the basis of introduced varieties in china  <cit> . upland cotton is native to central america. trice, lone star, stoneville 2b, dpl <dig>  uganda, kk <dig> and 611bo have been introduced into china from the united states and the former soviet union since  <dig>  <cit> . cotton breeding in china experienced seven breeding generations, new varieties updates , and expanded planting area. recently, thousands of upland cotton varieties and lines have been domesticated, bred and derived, in which more than  <dig> good varieties are widely employed in production. thus, the five main cotton regions, including the yellow river region , the yangtze river region , the northwestern inland region , the northern specific early maturation region  and the southern china region  formed gradually  <cit> . due to the narrow genetic basis and long-term directional selection in breeding, the genetic diversity in these upland varieties is low . therefore, the study on genetic diversity of basic upland germplasms and derived varieties can reveal the cotton genetic basis in china, provide understanding of the genetic background and genetic diversity of existing germplasms, lay the foundation for effectively exploring and using genes of important traits for breeders, and ascertain the direction of germplasm innovation.

the majority of traits in crops, such as agronomy, yield, quality and resistance, belong to quantitative traits controlled by multiple genes and present continuous phenotypic variation in segregation populations. the quantitative trait loci  with minor contributions to trait phenotype and sensitivity to environments lead to difficulties of identifying them  <cit> . recently, the development of molecular markers and the rapid development of statistical analysis methods for quantitative traits have provided a platform for the genetics of crop quantitative traits. with the increase of molecular marker and the release of cotton genome sequences, cotton genetic maps have become increasingly saturated  <cit> , and qtl have been identified for agronomic traits  <cit> , fiber quality  <cit> , growth stages  <cit>  and resistant traits  by linkage mapping. however, linkage mapping has its own limitations: the segregation populations are from two specific parents, and linkage mapping only refers to two alleles at the same loci; the limited number of reorganization events occurring in gene loci leads to qtl with low resolution, the precision of the linkage analysis is commonly up to 10–30 cm; the qtl detected in specific genetic backgrounds and environments cannot be extensively applied in other hybrid combinations and the environment, which should be further verified.

in recent years, exploring quantitative trait genes by association analysis has been one of the most active research topics in plant quantitative genetics. association analysis, also known as linkage disequilibrium mapping or association mapping, is based on linkage disequilibrium and combines analyzing the diversity of target traits and gene  polymorphism to identify marker loci with the functions of specific genes closely related to phenotypic variation. association analysis offers the following advantages compared with traditional linkage analysis: taking the natural population as the experimental materials, detecting multiple alleles on the same locus and targeting single genes. however, obvious complements exist between linkage and association analysis with respect to the accuracy and breadth of qtl mapping, the amount of information and statistical analysis methods. linkage analysis preliminarily locates the allele controlling a target trait; association analysis performs fast fine-mapping of the target gene  <cit> . thus, it is necessary to combine these advantages to confirm the qtl by linkage analysis.

in cotton, researchers has been conducted on traits related to agronomy, fiber quality, yield, growing stage and resistance using association analysis, and multiple marker loci associated with the above traits, elite alleles and carriers for breeding materials  have been identified. however, the materials were limited in these studies, which originated from limited cotton regions whose representations were not sufficient. the markers used in association analysis did not uniformly distribute on each chromosome, so they could not cover the whole cotton genome.

in this study,  <dig> upland cotton inbred cultivars, including those that have been grown in china since  <dig> and inbred cultivars developed between  <dig> and  <dig>  were used as the population panel;  <dig> genome-wide ssr markers from our high-density interspecific genetic map with  <dig> markers  <cit>  were selected at an average 10 cm to genotype the population. the objectives of our study were:  to analyze the population structure of upland cotton inbred cultivars developed in china;  to detect the marker loci associated with fiber quality traits;  to explore the elite alleles and the typical carried materials for future molecular design breeding in cotton; and  to provide multiple candidate genes and lay a foundation for further fine-mapping and gene cloning.

population structure
three methods were used to determine the population structure. first, the genetic structure based on ssr markers was constructed by separating pca plots, which revealed that the population was divided into  <dig> groups . the results revealed that each group was relatively independent, but there was mutual fusion. the special characteristics in each cotton region were formed due to the unique climate and geographical ecological environment. for example, the early-medium maturity cotton varieties cultivated in dense planting were more suitable for the nir and the nsemr. additionally, varieties in each cotton region, which were exchanged with each other, formed the same pedigree source. for example, as summarized in additional file 3: table s <dig>  zy <dig> served as a parent for zy <dig> , zy <dig> and zy <dig> , zy <dig> . thus, the cultivars in different cotton regions exchanged and maintained a relatively open system.fig.  <dig> pca plots of  <dig> upland cotton cultivars based on ssrs. blue triangles, green squares, brown triangles, purple diamonds, light blue square, red diamonds and yellow circles represent cultivars from different regions



secondly, based on nei’s genetic distance, the population formed  <dig> distinct groups in the unrooted tree , including  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> cultivars in groups i to vii, respectively. combining the genealogical, geographical and ecological distribution, each group was composed of cultivars from different sources but was dominated by cultivars from the same cotton area .

thirdly, the population structure was analyzed using structure software. the k value increased continuously with the increase of the lnp value, and no such plateau or obvious upward inflexion point was reached in this panel . as shown in fig. 2b, although the Δk value decreased rapidly from k =  <dig> to k =  <dig>  k =  <dig> represented the first peak , indicating that the population structure could be divided into  <dig> subgroups. the  <dig> subgroups included  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cultivars . thus, based on the three clustering methods, this population should be classified into  <dig> subpopulations.fig.  <dig> population structure analysis and lines chart of the k value with lnp value and Δk value based on structure analysis. line chart of the lnp value with the change of k ; line chart of the Δk value with the change of k ; population structure of  <dig> cultivar-based ssr markers . q-plot showing the clustering of  <dig> upland cotton cultivars based on the analysis of genotypic data using structure. each cultivar is represented by a vertical bar. the colored subsections within each vertical bar indicate the membership coefficient  of the cultivar to different clusters



linkage disequilibrium
the linkage disequilibrium  of this population was analyzed using  <dig> ssr markers. in a total of  <dig> pairwise comparisons of  <dig> polymorphic ssr marker loci,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of ssr marker loci demonstrated significant ld at p <  <dig> , p <  <dig>  and p <  <dig> , respectively. based on r <dig> estimates, only  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  of the marker pairs showed significant ld. in addition, the ld distribution was unevenly distributed on each chromosome, where the loci of higher ld level dramatically concentrated on chromosome <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .fig.  <dig> the distribution of ld among  <dig> ssr loci on  <dig> chromosomes in  <dig> upland cotton cultivars . ssr markers were along the x-axis. each pixel above the diagonal represents the r <dig> size of the corresponding pairs of markers, as shown in the color code at the upper right, and each pixel below the diagonal represents the p-value size of testing the ld at the lower right



to identify the genome-wide ld decay, r <dig> and d’ values of ld were plotted as a function of genetic distance in cm. the significant pairwise ld  was observed between some ssrs loci pairs within 50 cm distance. the genetic distance within 0–25 cm rapidly reduced when genome-wide ld was r2  ≥ <dig>  . thus, genome-wide ld at r2 <  <dig>   and d’ =  <dig>   was reduced to 0–5 cm, revealing potential for association mapping.

phenotypic variation of fiber quality traits
the phenotypic data  of fiber quality in eight environments were determined by best linear unbiased prediction , and then the breeding value of each cultivar for six fiber quality traits was obtained for association analysis. the cotton cultivars from seven cotton ecological regions in this study represented a broad variation in each experiment site. the highest coefficient of variation in fuhml  and fu  was discovered in cultivars from the soviet union; fs  and mv  from the nir; sf  and fe  from the nsemr and the united states, respectively. the highest coefficient of variation was observed in fe , the lowest in fu . the heritability was higher in fuhml and fe , ranging  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the other five traits .

the correlations of six fiber quality traits using the results of blup processing were listed in additional file  <dig>  and highly significant correlations were observed among the six fiber quality traits. there were positive correlations between fuhml and fs and fu and between mv and fe. there were negative correlations between fuhml and mv, fe, and sf; fs and fe and sf; and fu and sf and fe.

the phenotype trends of fiber quality are shown in fig.  <dig>  fuhml , fs , mv  and fe  had relatively stable changing trends in eight environments. the trait changing trends of fu  and sf  were less stable in the eight environments. for instance, in  <dig> and  <dig>  the means of fu in kuerle were  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively, with increasing trends, whereas they were  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, in huanggang, with decreasing trends .fig.  <dig> the boxplots of the changing trends of six fiber quality traits in eight environments



the correlations between two environments were obtained among eight environments for the six fiber quality traits . among the six fiber quality traits, the correlation means were ordered as fuhml  > fe  > fs  > mv  > fu  > sf . it was more important to further analyze one trait between two environments; taking fuhml as example , the correlations ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and the correlation was  <dig>  for fuhml_12kel and fuhml_ <dig> kel. the red line that was near the 45° as the line of greatest slope indicated a correlation between fuhml_12kel and fuhml_13kel.fig.  <dig> the correlations of six fiber quality traits in eight environments



association mapping of fiber quality-related traits
based on the genotype data, the pca matrix, the kinship matrix, and the fiber quality traits data of the blup results in  <dig> environments, a mixed linear model was used to analyze the marker-trait associations. during association mapping, three models, glm  + q, glm  + pcs, and mlm , were compared with each other in the association analysis . the control effect of the population structure for fuhml, fs, sf, and fe in the three models was similar. however, the mv analysis using the mlm-q-k model was superior to the other two models, and the fu analysis using the glm-q and mlm-q-k models was better than the of glm-pca model. according to the above comparison results, the mlm-q-k model had better performance.

a total of  <dig> ssr markers were used for marker-trait association after filtering for 5 % minimum alleles, among which  <dig>  markers were associated with fiber quality traits at the p <  <dig>  level. fifteen markers were significantly associated at the p <  <dig>  level . an average of  <dig>  markers was detected on each chromosome , with the maximum of  <dig> markers on chr <dig> and chr <dig>  one marker was generally associated with several traits. for example, mon_dc <dig> on chr <dig> was related to fuhml, sf, fu and fs, and nau <dig> on chr <dig> was related to fuhml, sf and fs.fig.  <dig> the distribution of the located markers associated with the fiber quality-related traits on  <dig> chromosomes



there were  <dig> loci associated with fiber quality components at the p <  <dig>  significance level, among which  <dig> were significant at the p <  <dig>  level. the range of phenotypic variation explanation  observed was from  <dig>  %  to  <dig>  , with an average of  <dig>  % .

among the  <dig> traits, fs was associated with the most loci, up to a maximum of  <dig>  and  <dig> ; pve ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  % , with a mean of  <dig>  %. the remarkable contribution loci were nau2858a , bnl3089a  and moncgr5399c , especially at the p <  <dig>  level.

fuhml was associated with the second number of loci, up to a maximum of  <dig>  and  <dig> ; pve ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  % , with a mean of  <dig>  %, in which nau5480a  had a significant contribution at p <  <dig> .

there were up to  <dig>  and  <dig>  loci associated with sf, and pves ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  % , with a mean of  <dig>  %. nau3084b , mon-dpl0893a , and mon-dc40013b  contributed prominently to sf at p <  <dig> .

there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  loci associated with fe, with pve ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>  % . bnl846b and mon_cgr5113b contributed to fe at p <  <dig> .

there were  <dig>  loci associated with mv, with pve ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>  % ; nbri-hq524733b contributing to mv was detected at p <  <dig> .

there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  loci associated with fu, and the pves ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  % , with a mean of  <dig>  %. the contribution loci were observed in mon-cgr5602a , mon-dpl 0893a , mon-dc40013b , nau3084c , hau1166b  and nau3084b  at p <  <dig> .

exploring elite allele-related genes in the cotton genome
the reference sequences of  <dig> elite allele loci associated with fiber quality traits were explored based on related genes in g. arboreum, g. raimondii and g. hirsutum,.

three allelic variation loci were related to gene functional annotation of fiber quality traits in g. arboreum . hau <dig> was associated with fu and sf on chr12; its homologous genes in g. arboreum and arabidopsis thaliana were cotton_a_ <dig> and at5g <dig> , respectively, which were annotated as home-domain-like hd-zip family with the function of promoting cotton fiber elongation and initiation. hau <dig> was associated with fuhml, fs and sf on chr18; its homologous genes in g. arboreum and arabidopsis thaliana were cotton_a_ <dig> and at4g <dig> , respectively, which were annotated as wd <dig> repeat-like-containing domain family with the function of promoting fiber epidermal cell initiation. mon-cgr <dig> was associated with fuhml and fs on chr11; its homologous genes in g. arboreum and arabidopsis thaliana were cotton_a_ <dig> and at4g <dig> , respectively, which were annotated as basic helix-loop-helix  dna-binding superfamily protein family to promote fiber epidermal cell initiation.

five allelic variation loci were related to the gene functional annotation of fiber quality traits in g. raimondii . the homologous genes of bnl <dig>  associated with fs on ch <dig> in g. raimondii and arabidopsis thaliana, were cotton_a_ <dig> and at4g <dig> , respectively, with the gene annotation of udp-glycosy-transferase 73b <dig>  which is involved in cell wall synthesis and fiber development. hau <dig> and hau <dig> were discovered with the same gene functional annotation as in g. arboreum. nau <dig> was associated with fuhml, sf and fs on chr <dig> with the same gene as mon_cgr <dig> in g. arboreum. the homologous genes of nau <dig>  associated with fs on chr <dig>  in g. raimondii and arabidopsis thaliana were gorai.007g <dig> and at5g <dig> , respectively, which have gene function related to myosin  <dig> and may be connected with the cell skeleton.

four allelic variation loci were related to the gene functional annotation of fiber quality traits in g. hirsutum . hau <dig>  mon_cgr <dig> and hau <dig> had the same gene annotation, as described above. stv <dig>  with the homologous genes gh_a06g <dig> and at1g <dig>  in g. hirsutum and arabidopsis thaliana, respectively, was a newly discovered allelic variation loci associated with fuhml, mv, fu, sf and fe on chr <dig>  whose gene annotation was an nac domain containing protein  <dig>  which thickens the secondary wall in arabidopsis thaliana and the xylem and cell wall in cotton.

discovery of superior alleles and typical materials
according to the genotype data of the loci associated with fiber quality-related traits identified at p <  <dig>  and the phenotype data of the blup results of  <dig> fiber quality-related traits in  <dig> environments,  <dig> materials with superior alleles were discovered . taking fuhml as an example,  <dig> marker loci of positive phenotypic effects and  <dig> marker loci of negative phenotypic effects were found, with blup values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm, respectively. nau1982a was the allelic variation locus with the maximum positive phenotypic effect  in zy495; meanwhile, mon-cgr6378c was the allelic variation locus with the maximum negative phenotypic effect  in zy <dig> 

discussion
population construction
the population panel consisted of  <dig> cultivars including some basic germplasms introduced from abroad and evolved through three variety replacement stages   <cit> , and breeding varieties from  <dig> to  <dig> in china. compared with the sample size of the population in previous researches  <cit> , our population was more comprehensive than others and was larger than  <dig>  which was sufficient for statistical power  <cit> . the population panel included cultivars from five main representative cultivated cotton regions and was thus enriched with abundant variations in yield, fiber quality and disease resistance. in this study, the evaluation of six fiber quality-related traits in eight environments showed wide variations , stable heritability  , and stable changing trends of each trait in different environments . phenotypic traits analysis based on the blup results ruled out environmental effects and improved the accuracy of the complex quantitative traits. both the composition of the population and the trait evaluation indicated that this population panel could be considered as an ideal resource for association mapping of quantitative traits in g. hirsutum.

molecular genetic diversity
in this study, a total of  <dig> ssr markers produced  <dig> allele loci after polymorphism detection from  <dig> genome-wide ssrs in the population. the average genetic diversity and pic were  <dig>   and  <dig>   respectively, which were higher than that of qin et al.  <cit> . our research results indicated that the selected markers had sufficient polymorphic information to reveal the genetic relationship between these upland cotton inbred cultivars.

the results also indicated that the average genetic similarity coefficient variation was  <dig>  , which could benefit cotton breeders in selecting parents in hybridization breeding to create novel variations and to develop new cultivars. comparison with previously published studies  showed that the molecular diversity in our population was higher. in fact, the previous researchers emphasized the narrow genetic basis of upland cotton and selected only upland cotton germplasms representing part of the cotton planted areas or breeding periods. for example, the studies on upland cotton germplasms by ai et al.  <cit>  and nie et al.  <cit>  only studied the northwest inland cotton varieties , which were mainly derived from the former soviet union.

population structure
the evaluation of the population genetic structure is a prerequisite of genome-wide association studies  <cit> , because false associations usually caused by population structure  <cit> . a reasonably accurate population structure can lead to more genetic similarity within each group and higher genetic differences among groups and largely reduce the defectives in association analysis  <cit> . thus, the accuracy of the association analysis depended on whether the population structure was appropriate  <cit> . previously, abdurakhmonov et al. used q-matrix to estimate accession clusters  <cit> . qin et al.  <cit>  and cai et al.  <cit>  determined the population structure using structure software to show k values. wang et al.  <cit>  determined the genetic structure of  <dig> accessions of g. barbadense by separating pca plots based on ssr and srap markers. in this study, the three methods of pca, unrooted and rounded tree, with k =  <dig> corresponding to the uppermost structural level in the contact zone model, were combined to predict the population structure based on  <dig> allele loci generated by  <dig> ssr markers distributing on the  <dig> chromosomes. the population was classified into  <dig> subpopulations, which was reasonable to eliminate the spurious association effects in the association analysis.

linkage disequilibrium
ld, defined as nonrandom combinational alleles at different gene loci  <cit> , is the genetic underpinnings of association analysis. in our study, it was shown that different numbers of linear arrays of linkage disequilibrium loci distributed on each chromosome, especially the pair-loci number of ld on chr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> , on which there were more polymorphic loci associated with fiber quality traits. for example, among the  <dig> polymorphic loci on chr <dig>   <dig> marker loci were related to fiber quality traits. therefore, linkage disequilibrium was the basis of the association analysis, in which each pair-loci of ld represented a group allelic variation. the stronger ld degree between the loci in the different allelic variations with functional differences, the more qtl associated with their phenotype were detected.

recombination was the greatest factor influencing ld. generally, ld level is high in self-pollinated crops, and low in cross-pollination crops because it will have a higher recombination rate and break the linkage disequilibrium between gene loci  <cit> . cotton is a cross-pollination crop with a higher recombination rate; moreover, a significant amount of human behavior, including cross, backcross, open pollination, germplasm introduction and exchange during breeding in different cotton planting regions greatly increase the recombination rate, which leads to the low ld level in the cotton genome. abdurakhmonov et al.  <cit>  found that the attenuation distance of ld was 25 cm, 10 cm and 30 cm at r2 ≥  <dig> , and the distance reached 5–6 cm, 1–2 cm and 6–8 cm at r2 ≥  <dig> ; zhang et al.  <cit>  reported that the attenuation distance of ld was  <dig>  cm and less than 1 cm at r2 ≥  <dig>  and r2 ≥  <dig>  respectively. fang et al.  <cit>  observed that the attenuation distance of ld of the average chromosome was approximately  <dig>  cm. qin et al.  <cit>  discovered that the attenuation distance of linkage disequilibrium decreased dramatically to 0–10 cm. in this study, the attenuation distance of ld decreased dramatically to 0–5 cm, as seen from the ld attenuation figure , which would be useful to fine mapping candidate qtl.

association mapping qtl for fiber quality traits
the  <dig> marker loci  associated with six fiber traits in this study were compared to other reported qtl in cotton. thirteen marker loci identified in our study coincided with previous research, of which  <dig> marker loci were detected with the same traits . nau <dig>  <cit>  on chr <dig> and related to fs was located at different positions. nau <dig>  <cit> , dramatically significant for fuhml and with much higher explanation of variation, was detected on chr <dig>  bnl <dig>  <cit>  on chr <dig>  significant for fs, was detected by two previous researchers. the common qtl detected by different researchers indicated that the marker loci associated with fiber quality traits in our study were reliable.table  <dig> comparison of qtl associated with fiber quality traits to the reported studies



comparing our qtl reference sequences to g. arboreum  <cit> , g. raimondii  <cit>  and g. hirsutum  <cit>  showed that  <dig> qtl were related to the gene function of fiber development . recently, shan et al. verified that a homeodomain-like superfamily protein, ghhox <dig>  could control cotton fiber elongation  <cit> , and was associated with the marker locus for fiber length and uniformity  <cit> . coincidentally, some genes annotated as the homeodomain-like superfamily in the marker locus hau <dig> were found for fiber uniformity in our study. a gene annotated as udp-glycosyltranserase was found to be related to bnl <dig>  udp-glycosyltransferase was reported to be involved in the regulation of cell wall pectin biosynthesis  <cit> . these candidate genes within the qtl could affect mature fiber quality traits by regulating fiber cell development and cell wall biogenesis. nau <dig>  and mon-cgr <dig> , which were  <dig>  cm in genetic distance, were significantly associated with fs on chr <dig>  nau <dig>  related to a gene annotated as myosin <dig>  a cytoskeleton related gene, was within the marker locus bnl <dig> for fiber strength. there was a report that another cell skeleton interaction protein, ghwlim1a, could promoter fiber cell elongation and regulates fiber secondary cell wall biogenesis  <cit> . overexpression of the ghwim1a gene also could increase mature fiber strength, which indicated that myosin <dig> was an important candidate gene identified from qtl associated with fiber strength. stv <dig> was related to an nac domain containing protein  <cit> , which could regulate secondary wall biogenesis and may partially explain why stv <dig> was associated with five main fiber quality traits. cotton fiber cell initiation was similar to trichome in arabidopsis, which is regulated by wd <dig>  bhlh and myb transcript factors  <cit> . we found that some genes that were annotated as wd <dig> or bhlh in hau <dig>  moncgr <dig> and nav <dig>  the relationships between fiber development-related genes and mature fiber quality traits require further research.table  <dig> allelic variation loci associated with fiber quality and annotated genes



applications in breeding
the information of this study provided the characteristics of phenotypic variation of fiber quality traits, the genetic diversity, population structure and elite alleles and encouraged us to take a further study to propose a detailed scheme for applying the above results in cotton breeding.

firstly, specific and elite alleles considered as selection tags of genetic fragments of introgression lines were used to characterize different foreground selection parents and were then crossed within infiltration lines to assemble elite alleles from different marker loci into one recipient parent and breed excellent hybrid progeny by allelic bands assisted selection. for example, in our study, nau <dig> , mon_dpl0544b  and hau <dig>  associated with fuhml,nau <dig>  and nau <dig>  associated with fs, and dpl <dig>  and nau <dig>  associated with mv. these elite alleles could be combined by marker-assisted selection to develop accessions with super fiber quality.

secondly, elite germplasms could be selected as parents in the breeding program based on the association results; the typical carrier materials aggregated the allelic variation with the most positive efficiency, more distant genetic relationship and complementary elite and stable genetic traits. for example, according to the phenotypic effects of each germplasm based on the blup of six fiber quality traits in eight environments , zy <dig>  zy <dig> and zy <dig> had higher phenotypic effects for fuhml, fs and mv, respectively; meanwhile, zy <dig> had higher phenotypic effects for fuhml and relatively lower phenotypic effects for fs. comparing the genetic similarity coefficients of zy <dig>  zy <dig> and zy <dig> to zy <dig>  the lowest genetic similarity coefficient between zy <dig> and zy <dig> indicated that they could be selected to improve fiber quality.

CONCLUSIONS
an association mapping population of  <dig> nation-wide upland cottons in china was genotyped by  <dig> genome-wide ssrs and phenotyped in eight environments, which revealed abundant molecular diversity and phenotypic variations. the population was divided into seven subpopulations by comprehensive analysis; and the attenuation distance of ld in this population was 0–5 cm. mlm based association mapping for fiber quality detected known and novel elite alleles, and typical materials were identified. the results in this study will provide a platform for future genetics and breeding in cotton.
