BACKGROUND
multicopper oxidases  are a group of enzymes that are able to couple the oxidation of a variety of different substrates concomitantly with dioxygen reduction to water  <cit> . this protein family comprises laccases, , metalloxidases, ascorbate oxidase and ceruloplasmin  <cit> . they are found in prokaryotes, eukaryotes as well as in archea. in plants, they have been associated with lignin formation; in fungi, with pigment formation, lignin degradation and detoxification processes; in yeast and mammals with iron metabolism; in bacteria with copper homeostasis and manganese oxidation . overall, they are capable of oxidise substrates that vary from organic compounds, such as ascorbic acid, phenolate siderophores and organic amines, to inorganic ones, such as metal ions like fe, cu and mn . in addition, they are able to transfer their electrons to molecular oxygen with the concomitant production of water, a mechanism that can also constitute a key factor in the management of oxygen in aerobic organisms  <cit> . these characteristics made them important targets for structure-function studies. furthermore, laccases have been show to have diverse biotechnological applications constituting a model for this type of studies  <cit> .

laccases, which are the simplest members of the mcos family, show a characteristic fold that comprises three cupredoxin domains, with a mononuclear copper centre localised in the third domain, and a trinuclear copper centre located in between the first and the third domains . the four copper atoms can be classified in three different classes, based on their spectroscopic features  <cit> . the type  <dig>  mononuclear copper centre  shows an intense absorption band at ca.  <dig> nm, which is responsible for the blue colour of the protein, and is due to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer between the cysteine sulphur and the copper atom. this site also shows a characteristic epr signal that is due to the high covalency at the copper site. the type  <dig>  copper site, located in the trinuclear centre , also exhibits a characteristic epr signal, but no observable bands in the absorption spectra. the pair of type  <dig>  copper ions are also localised in the trinuclear centre and are epr silent, a fact attributed to their antiferromagnetic coupling in the presence of a bridging ligand, normally assumed to be hydroxyl. the t <dig> site also shows an absorption band at ca.  <dig> nm that has been attributed to the charge transfer between an hydroxyl bridging group and the copper atoms   <cit> .

mcos catalyze one-electron oxidation processes, and four molecules of substrate are oxidised in order to reduce a dioxygen molecule to two waters molecules. substrate oxidation occurs at the mononuclear t <dig> centre and then the electrons are shuttled, along a t <dig> coordinating cisteine, to the two histidines that are coordinating the t <dig> coppers of the trinuclear centre , where reduction of dioxygen occurs  <cit> . this constitutes a hch conserved motif characteristically found in mcos. four electrons, as well as four protons, are used to reduce a molecule of dioxygen with the concomitant formation of two water molecules  <cit> . electrons needed for this process are obtained through the oxidation of a variety of substrates, but not much is known about the mechanism of proton transfer during this process. recently, site directed mutagenesis studies suggest that asp <dig> of cueo   <cit> , a conserved residue that is located in the exit channel in close proximity to the t <dig> copper ion, plays an important role in the protonation process. a similar role has been suggested for asp <dig> in fet3p  <cit> , which is also the equivalent residue of cota asp <dig>  this internalised acidic group participates in a network of hydrogen bonds involving ligands of the trinuclear centre , being connected with cu <dig> through a chain of water molecules. site directed mutagenesis studies, on the prokaryotic multicopper oxidase cueo  <cit>  and on the eukaryotic multicopper oxidase fet3p  <cit> , provided evidence for the importance of acidic residues located in the entrance channel in the reduction of dioxygen by these enzymes. these are glu <dig> in cueo  <cit>  ), and glu <dig> in fet3p  <cit>  . despite the fact that these two residues are not conserved in sequence in all mcos, the authors provide evidence for their participation in proton transfer to the reduction of dioxygen. in many structures, this acidic group can form a hydrogen bond with a water molecule that interacts with the oxygen species between the t <dig> coppers .

in order to study the mechanism of dioxygen reduction to water by mcos, cota, a thermostable and thermoactive laccase, from bacillus subtilis, was used as a model system  <cit> . the x-ray structure determination of cota-laccase, in different redox states and in complex with hydrogen peroxide and azide, together with the crystals structures from other mcos already deposited in the pdb http://www.pdb.org <cit> , allowed the proposal of a mechanism for such an enzymatic process  <cit> . however, many questions remain to be addressed, including the mechanism of protonation, the nature of the resting state of these enzymes and the identification of key residues that are involved in the reduction of dioxygen. the first mco x-ray crystal structure to be reported was that of ascorbate oxidase  <cit> , in which a hydroxyl moiety bridged the two t <dig> copper ions; this structure has frequently been taken as the template for the native state. most spectroscopic measurements have also indicated that mcos, in their resting state, have a hydroxyl group as a bridging ligand. however, nearly all crystal structures of cota that have been determined  <cit> , and in particular the one where full copper content was achieved by soaking the crystals with cucl <dig>   <cit> , pdb code: 1w6l), indicate that the structure of the oxidised state of this enzyme has a dioxygen moiety bridging the two t <dig> copper ions  <cit>  . it is therefore pertinent to ask whether the cota-laccase has the same resting state as others mcos. in order to try to answer this question the x-ray structures of two new preparations of cota laccase  <cit>  were determined. the first one corresponds to an in vivo fully copper loaded cota protein , isolated from cells grown in copper supplemented media under microaerobic conditions. the second one corresponds to an in vitro reconstituted ) fully copper loaded protein ) <cit> . this apo protein was obtained from cells grown aerobically in unsupplemented copper media, and despite having been soaked with cu, its spectra shows that it contains cu  <cit> , meaning that the protein became oxidised when exposed to the oxygen. the structural comparison between these structures and the previous determined holocu  <cit>  will be performed in order to study the conformational effects of the different ways for incorporating copper in cota. moreover, the new structures determined here, together with the structures of other states, obtained for the same protein, were used in equilibrium protonation simulations in order to locate the groups likely to be involved in proton transfer. this combined structural biology approach, where x-ray structures of a system are obtained in controlled conditions by the same team , and their conformational differences clearly identified in the electron density maps, is fundamental for the success of this type of calculations and mechanistic analysis, which are sensitive to small details. the application of careful procedures  was tested before with success in the analysis of multihaem cytochromes  <cit>  as well as in cota mutants  <cit> . this type of proton transfer studies on laccases may also be helpful for understanding other dioxygen processing enzymes, where proton transfer plays a key role. the best known examples are the haem-copper oxidases  <cit> , where electron transfer and dioxygen reduction, at the core of the protein, are associated with proton transfer of "chemical" protons, necessary for the reaction, as well as with vectorial proton pumping across the membrane. similar types of approaches as the ones applied here for cota laccase, based on continuum electrostatics/monte carlo calculations  done on structural data, were used in haem-copper oxidases in order to understand their proton transfer determinants  <cit> . despite different molecular architectures, the physical principles behind proton transfer mechanisms in multicopper oxidases should be similar, at least in part, with the ones present in haem-copper, especially with what concerns "chemical" protons.

RESULTS
structural characterization of holocota and of apocu
the overall comparison with holocu  <cit>  of the three-dimensional structures obtained for both holocota and apocu, showed no significant differences. the proteins comprise three cupredoxin domains with a mononuclear copper centre localized in domain  <dig> and a trinuclear centre in between domains  <dig> and  <dig>  the rms deviation of the cα trace of the holocota and apocu structures from the structure of holocu is about  <dig>  Å. the most significant differences found between the structures were localized at the trinuclear centre and in the copper content. the holocota structure, in a similar manner as holocu, shows full occupancy for all copper atoms in both copper centres and has a dioxygen moiety modelled almost symmetrically between the two t <dig> coppers . however, in the holocota structure, a fifth copper atom was modelled with half occupancy at the surface of the molecule, located ca.  <dig> Å away from the other two copper centres . this copper atom, coordinated by two histidine residues and by two water molecules, is localised close to a disordered coil region that has been poorly defined in the calculated electron density maps for all other cota structures determined until now. as the crystallisation conditions are different from the ones used previously, we cannot rule out the possibility that this may be an artefact of the crystallization procedure. however, we did not add any extra copper to the crystallization solutions. therefore, this extra copper may be a consequence of the new protocol used to produce the protein. the overall structure of holocota determined here, with the exception of this extra copper, which was never been observed before, is basically the same as holocu determined previously  <cit> , and should correspond to the same chemical species.

the apocu structure shows full occupancy for the t <dig> copper centre but depletion for all copper atoms in the trinuclear centre . as previously observed, the most depleted copper atom is the t <dig> copper . interestingly, in the trinuclear centre a hydroxyl group was modelled in between the t <dig> coppers, with the same occupancy as the copper atoms . in this case, the distance between the two t <dig> coppers is slightly shorter  than the observed for the structures where a dioxygen moiety was modelled at this position . in addition, the water molecule that is localized at h-bond distance of the oxygen moiety in holocota was not observed in the electron density maps . in the apocu structure an oxy-cysteine residue was modelled at position  <dig>  according to the electron density maps.

‡based on maximum likelihood. † rms deviations from standard values

the ramachandran analysis  <cit>  was determined by rampage  <cit> 

uv/visible absorption spectra of holocota and apocu crystals  were acquired as described above. both spectra show the characteristics observed for the holocota solution  <cit> , namely an intense peak at  <dig> nm, which is due to the charge transfer between the copper atom  and the cysteine residue at the mononuclear t <dig> copper centre, and a shoulder at around  <dig> nm. this shoulder is usually attributed to coupling of the t <dig> copper ions through a hydroxyl moiety in between them. the biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of holocota and apocu showed that they have different catalytic and biophysical properties  <cit> . indeed, the reconstituted apocu is less efficient towards the oxidation of non-phenolic substrates, shows a lower redox potential and is less thermostable than the holocota enzyme  <cit> . since there are no significant changes in their overall three dimensional structures, such differences can be attributed to changes at the copper centres, namely the copper content and the nature of the bridging ligand in between the two t <dig> coppers. an enzyme that does not contain its full copper content, such as observed in the crystal structure of apocu, will behave differently. the question as to why the enzyme was able to incorporate all the copper content in vivo and did not succeed in doing the same when incorporation was done in vitro, remains to be solved. one hypothesis is that, in vivo, the incorporation of copper occurs during the folding process, in a transition state that facilitates the incorporation of four positive charges  state), whereas in vitro, when the final fold is already acquired, this incorporation process becomes less favourable and, therefore, less efficient. work in our laboratories is currently being pursuit to address this question.

mechanism of dioxygen reduction to water: insights into the characterization of the resting state of mcos
the mechanism of dioxygen reduction to water includes a state where a dioxygen moiety is located between the two t <dig> coppers and another state where a hydroxyl group is at this position . the latter is formed after the oxidation of four substrate molecules and the transfer of four electrons to the trinuclear centre  <cit> . for the majority of studies on the multi-copper oxidases, this state has been assumed to be the resting state. however, in cota this state has only been observed in the structure of a semi-reduced crystal   <cit>  and, in the present study, in the structure of the reconstituted apocu. the apo protein was incubated with cu in anaerobic conditions  <cit> , implying that when oxygen became available the enzyme was ready to reduce it to water . indeed, in many studies where such a moiety is observed, the experimental starting point is the reduced state of the enzyme. moreover, studies on the effect of the x-ray radiation on laccase crystals reported by hakulinen et al.  <cit>  showed that crystals exposed to high radiation doses present a hydroxyl moiety in the trinuclear site. this shows that reduction of the copper centres may occur during data collection, leading to an end-product that can be different from the starting state. altogether, these data highlight that the observable state of the enzyme depends critically on the experimental conditions. indeed, this has been clearly shown for bilirubin oxidase by sakurai et. al.  <cit> . on the other hand, laccases usually show a characteristic absorption spectrum with a shoulder around  <dig> nm that has been attributed to the presence of the bridging hydroxyl in between the t <dig> coppers. the spectrum obtained for the holocota  also shows this shoulder, but the crystal structure has a dioxygen moiety at the trinuclear cluster. moreover, the same shoulder was observed in the spectrum acquired from crystals of the laccase from m. albomyces, before being exposed to the x-ray radiation  <cit> , and this laccase has also a dioxygen moiety in the trinuclear centre. it could be argued that the dioxygen moiety was the well characterised peroxide intermediate   <cit> . however, in both cases, the enzymes were in the oxidised state and no electrons were available to reduce the dioxygen molecule. it is therefore clear that a shoulder around  <dig> nm in the absorption spectrum can also be attributed to a dioxygen moiety. what is the resting state of multi-copper oxidases is a question that still remains to be answered. it is possible that mcos have more than one resting state depending on the residues that surround the trinuclear centre. in fact, the current work clearly shows that the final results are dependent on the process of obtaining the protein; therefore, it is still not possible to give a clear unbiased answer.

mechanism of dioxygen reduction to water: groups involved in the proton transfer mechanism
the availability of three-dimensional structures for several states of the trinuclear centre, with different oxygen species bound, allows the investigation of the protonation of ionisable groups involved in the enzymatic mechanism. a working hypothesis for the mechanism in this type of enzymes is presented on figure  <dig>  only considering the water molecules that are consistently observed in all deposited three-dimensional structures . ce/mc calculations were done on these structures, not taking into account any other water molecules in an explicit way. however, mobile water molecules that should exist inside protein structures are modelled implicitly by this procedure, since it considers empty cavities inside the protein as high dielectric zones containing solvent. despite the fact that several studies  document the existence of hydrophobic cavities inside proteins, which are devoid of water and are, therefore, not correctly treated by this procedure, no such cavities exist inside cota near the two active sites. the closest cavity in cota, which can potentially display such characteristics, is almost  <dig> Å away from the dioxygen binding site and more than  <dig> Å from the t <dig> copper. not considering water molecules here, and in other proton transfer processes, is a simplification, and clearly we cannot describe the whole proton transfer process. however, this is a necessary limitation of the present methodology, given the high energetic cost of deprotonating water molecules. for this reason, their deprotonation is transient in nature, and they may act through a grotthuss like mechanism  for a review), being present in "proton wires". nevertheless, in long distance proton transfer, one usually finds protonatable groups that can form protonation intermediates in the "proton wire", allowing protons to be transferred in smaller steps. the aim here is to identify these protonatable groups that were likely to be involved in the process of proton transfer, necessary for the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. these groups are probably located close to the trinuclear centre in order to transfer protons to the intermediate oxygen species formed along the mechanism . analysis of the protonation equilibrium simulations evidenced that the only group actively titrating around ph  <dig>  near the zone of interest, is glu  <dig>  an acidic group present in the dioxygen entrance channel in cota laccase. the ph titration of glu  <dig> obtained for all the available structurally characterised states of the trinuclear centre of cota is presented in figure  <dig> and will be discussed in the following paragraph. in view of the limitations of this type of simulations , the rationalisation of the results should consider ph ranges, rather than exact values of ph. additionally, what we aim at analysing is the difference between the different redox and ligand binding states of the protein, which should be less prone to the errors described above; therefore we will concentrate on analysing differential behaviour mostly.

starting from the fully functional enzyme with dioxygen between the t <dig> copper ions ; holocota), the simulations show that the protonation of glu <dig> is negligible around ph  <dig>  this situation changes dramatically for the peroxide adduct, which corresponds to a  <dig> electron reduced species of the previous state : glu  <dig> increases its protonation by a large degree, showing a considerable protonated fraction around ph  <dig>  the next two states in the mechanism in figure  <dig>  have not been structurally characterised in cota, and therefore we could not perform calculations on them. the state in figure 4c is observed if more electrons and protons  are delivered to the trinuclear centre, resulting in the native intermediate that contains two hydroxyl groups; this is observed in the laccase structure from t. hirsuta   <cit> . upon further structural rearrangements another configuration for these two hydroxyl groups is reached; this is the state observed in the ascorbate oxidase structure   <cit> . the next state in the mechanism could be structurally characterised in cota and it is a state that results from a release, upon protonation, of one of the hydroxyl groups as water; this is the structure of apocu  determined in this work. calculations using this structure show that the ph titration curve of glu  <dig> does not evidence a very marked protonation around ph  <dig>  but a higher affinity for protons is observed instead, when compared with the dioxygen bound structure. upon further protonation of this hydroxyl moiety , its release as a water molecule, and the entrance of another dioxygen molecule, the holocota structure is restored, closing the cycle. the fully reduced structure ; cota-red)  <cit> , has glu  <dig> predominantly protonated.

the simulation results reported above, and shown in figure  <dig>  clearly suggest that, irrespectively of details, the protonation of glu  <dig> is sensitive to the redox and liganted state of the trinuclear centre. thus, being the only group in the vicinity of this centre to exhibit these characteristics, it is likely to play a proton transfer role for the reduction of oxygen to water. additionally, its long redox titration curves, spanning almost  <dig> ph units in the cases of cota-h2o <dig> and cota-red , clearly show that its binding fluctuations  can be used for the deliverance of protons to the reaction, in a rather flexible way. several reports describing mutants of other negatively charged residues in the oxygen access channel, namely in fet3p   <cit>  and cueo   <cit> , point to a role of these residues in the catalysis of oxygen reduction, a fact interpreted by the authors as their involvement in proton donation. dft calculations  <cit>  have also been used in trinuclear centre models to highlight the potential effect of this residue in proton transfer along the mechanism. therefore, the data that is presented here further corroborates these findings.

in laccases, the exit channel for water molecules also contains, at least, one acidic residue, asp <dig> in cota , in close proximity to the t <dig> copper centre. the equivalent residue in fet3p   <cit>  and in cueo   <cit>  has undergone mutation studies and been subject to dft calculations  <cit> . these studies have demonstrated the importance of such a residue for the mechanism of oxygen reduction in multi-copper oxidases. in some of these reports  <cit> , it is suggested that this residue is involved in proton transfer. however, the present calculations on cota shows that this group is not proton active around ph  <dig> in any of the states analysed; in fact, it is mostly charged in all the ph range considered . given its proximity, this residue could become protonated when a hydroxyl group is bound to the t <dig> copper ion . we have not yet characterised this state in cota, but we did perform test calculations on the apocu conformation by decreasing the overall charge of the t <dig> cu bound water molecule by one charge unit . these calculations , despite showing an increased protonation pattern of this acid, did not show an increase in the protonation of asp <dig> to values that would make it proton-active around ph  <dig>  further suggesting that this group is unlikely to be involved in proton transfer mechanisms. a possible explanation for its reported relevance in the activity of laccases, may be related with the role of this aspartate in maintaining a proper structural arrangement of the trinuclear centre, by being hydrogen bonded to his  <dig> and his  <dig>  which coordinate one of the t <dig> and the t <dig> coppers, respectively . the requirement for a charged residue at this position is suggested by the mutants made on fet3p  <cit>  and cueo  <cit> , which show that its mutation to glutamate results in the smaller perturbation in activity, whereas its mutation to alanine or to asparagine results in a drastic decrease of the enzyme activity.

one could argue that the results presented here, by having been done with one particular enzyme of the bacterial multicopper oxidase family - cota laccase - may be specific for this particular enzyme. namely, one could raise the possibility that the residues equivalent to glu  <dig> and asp  <dig> in other multicopper oxidases, which have been subjected to site-directly mutagenesis, may behave differently. in order to investigate this, we set up test calculations using the structure of the multicopper oxidase cueo from e. coli  <cit> . given that the only structurally characterised state in this multicopper oxidase is the oxidised, hydroxyl bridged t <dig> state  state of cota), we had to setup mimics for the two hydroxyl state  and for the fully reduced state. these studies evidence  that glu  <dig>  similar to its equivalent glu  <dig> in cota, is very sensitive to the redox and liganted states of the trinuclear centre, being mostly deprotonated in the oxidised, hydroxyl bridged t <dig> state , but becoming mostly protonated in the fully reduced state . on the other hand, the behaviour of asp  <dig> is also similar to its equivalent asp  <dig> in cota, being mostly deprotonated in the whole of the ph range investigated, in all three states studied . therefore, these studies strongly suggest that the reported behaviour that we found in cota laccase is probably general for other bacterial multicopper oxidases.

electron-proton coupling is at the core of many redox enzyme mechanisms, and it is possible that multicopper oxidases are no exception. the methodology applied here was early developed to consider these effects in a complete way  <cit> . despite the fact that the complete interplay between the two redox centres and protonatable groups cannot be studied, at this time, in an exact way, the coupling between the redox state of t <dig> and the protonation of any protonatable group is amenable to be analysed by our simulations. these clearly show that the titration of glu  <dig> depends on the redox state of t <dig>  as an example, figure  <dig> shows the effect of the reduction of this centre alone on the titration of glu  <dig> in the peroxide adduct structure . the pka of this group increases by  <dig>  ph units, from  <dig>  to  <dig> , evidencing the influence of the redox state of t <dig> on its protonation. on the other hand, the different redox and bridging moieties of the trinuclear centre  also show an influence on the redox affinity of the t <dig> centre, as shown in the redox titrations  of the t <dig> centre performed in the different structurally characterised states of the trinuclear centre . although the simulated situations correspond to "pure" states, that may not have direct experimental counterparts , these results are illustrative of the interplay between the redox states of the two centres. the redox potential of t <dig> has a span of  <dig> mv in the situations analysed, and it decreases with higher reduction of the trinuclear centre and bound entities. this data can be compared to experimental data obtained previously for cota ). experimentally it was found  <cit>  that the redox potential of apocu  was  <dig> mv versus  <dig> mv for the holocota . the present simulations also show a decrease, from  <dig> mv for holocota  to  <dig> mv for apocu, even if this decrease is larger than that experimentally observed. however, it must be stressed again that the experimental and simulated situations may not correspond to the same exact process. nevertheless, and irrespectively of the actual value of the calculated redox potential, which is prone to considerable error in the present simulations , the present simulations show the same trend, and this is the important conclusion to be retained here. these observations show how the coupling between the t <dig> and trinuclear centres is important in the mechanism of laccases.

the present work suggests the importance of glu  <dig> in the proton transfer mechanisms operating at the trinuclear centre and its vicinity. however, it should be remembered that this acidic group is not conserved in all laccases, although it is found, to our knowledge, in the same position in all the prokaryotic laccases that have been structurally characterised. in structurally characterised eukaryotic laccases, no acidic residue is found in this exact position, but an acid is always observed in the oxygen access channel , suggesting a similar role for this group. as stated before, mutations were made  <cit>  on one of these acidic groups on the eukaryotic multicopper oxidase fet3p ), showing its importance in the mechanism; additionally, the authors suggested its role in proton transfer. it is foreseeable that equivalent acidic groups, or other acidic groups in the oxygen access channel of other multicopper oxidases, play a similar role. nevertheless, the available structural characterisation of multicopper oxidases evidences  that the distance between these acidic groups and the trinuclear centre is larger in eukaryotic than in prokaryotic enzymes. this difference may have some consequences in the details of the proton transfer mechanism, but the overall reported importance of these acid groups corroborates the hypothesis that they are responsible for the proton transfer mechanisms in multicopper oxidases.

the identification of glu  <dig> as involved in proton transfer, should not rule out other residues in the vicinity of the trinuclear centre that may be important. one should not forget that our calculations address the thermodynamics of proton transfer, and their redox coupling, not considering the other component of this process, which is proton transfer kinetics that is much more complex to model . therefore, there may be other important groups in this kinetic process that have not been identified yet, despite the fact that no clear-cut experimental evidence has been provided so far. nevertheless, the influence on the mechanism evidenced by mutational and other studies of asp  <dig>  in fet3p  <cit>  and in cueo  <cit>  may suggest such a role.

the differences in structurally characterised resting states observed for different laccases may result from the molecular details in the vicinity of trinuclear site. in addition to being observed in the cota laccase  <cit> , the dioxygen entity is only observed in the eukaryotic laccase from melanocarpus albomices  <cit> . however, in this latter case, the structure has a cl- anion bound to the t <dig> copper ion, instead of a water or hydroxyl group, as observed in other laccases. it is tempting to speculate that the proximity of glu  <dig>  or equivalent groups, to the trinuclear centre in prokaryotic laccases  can be a factor for the stability of the dioxygen state, but other factors may exist. one example of the sensitivity of the trinuclear centre to the effects of its surroundings is the influence of the acidic group equivalent to asp  <dig> in cota  on the calculated differential stability of different conformations of the peroxyl intermediate  <cit> . in fact, the trinuclear centre in multicopper oxidases seems to be fine tuned to achieve proper catalysis, as evidenced by a recent study focused on t <dig> copper sites  <cit> . further studies are clearly needed to further characterise this phenomenon.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, these studies clearly indicate that in the cota laccase, glu <dig> in the entrance channel for the dioxygen moiety plays a role in channelling protons during the reduction process. they also show that the observation of a shoulder at  <dig> nm in the absorption spectrum, due to the antiferromagnetic coupling of the t <dig> copper ions, is present when the bridging species is either a hydroxyl or a dioxygen moiety. the results also strongly support the mechanism of dioxygen reduction as indicated in figure  <dig>  however, one key stage that requires further study is the mechanism by which the hydroxyl or water molecules produced by the reaction migrate past the t <dig> copper ion, before leaving the enzyme through the exit channel.

recently, after the submission of this work, we made mutants of glu <dig> in cota, which show severe catalytic impairment when this group is substituted by threonine or leucine  <cit>  substitution by an aspartate renders an enzyme with 10% catalytic activity. these results are totally consistent with the results presented here, evidencing the need for an acid residue at this structural position.
