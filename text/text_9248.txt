BACKGROUND
aging results in alterations in multiple physiologic processes  <cit> . the identification and measurement of markers of aging to predict lifespan is a major element of aging research  <cit> . because the nematode caenorhabditis elegans is genetically tractable, it has become a major model organism for studies of aging  <cit> , neurobiology  <cit> , cell cycle  <cit> , chemosensation  <cit> , microbial pathogenesis, and host defenses  <cit> . c. elegans is particularly suited to studies of aging, since numerous single-gene mutations have been identified that affect c. elegans lifespan   <cit> .

c. elegans are free-living nematodes residing in the soil, where they feed on bacteria. in the laboratory, c. elegans are normally cultured on a lawn of escherichia coli , on which they feed ad libitum. although e. coli op <dig> is considered non-pathogenic for the worms, as c. elegans age, the pharynx and the intestine are frequently distended and packed with bacterial cells  <cit> . this striking phenotype of bacterial proliferation exhibited by old animals, has been hypothesized to contribute to worm aging and demise  <cit> . c. elegans grown on bacteria that were unable to proliferate, including those killed by uv treatment or by antibiotics, had much lower rates of intestinal packing and longer lifespan  <cit> , suggesting that bacterial proliferation within the gastrointestinal tract may contribute to the death of the animals. one implication of these findings is that as the worms age, they lose the capacity to control intestinal bacterial proliferation. however, perhaps paradoxically, c. elegans has a nutritional requirement for live, metabolically active bacteria, since worms fed on non-viable bacteria appear ill and have diminished fecundity  <cit> .

c. elegans possesses an innate immune system with evolutionarily conserved signaling; anti-microbial innate immunity is modulated by pathways involving the daf- <dig>  receptor, p <dig> map kinase, and transforming growth factor β  . aging also substantially diminishes the efficiency of innate immunity  <cit> . we hypothesized that gut immunity is less efficient in older animals, leading to enhanced bacterial accumulation, reducing longevity. to address this question, we evaluated the ability of worms to control bacterial accumulation as a functional marker of intestinal immunity. we considered the effect on longevity of the bacterial species used as nutrient source, as well as host age and host genotype. we studied genes directly related to intestinal immunity and those that are not known to be related. we found a strong inverse relationship between intestinal bacterial accumulation and c. elegans longevity, operating across a range of host genotypes. these results suggest that intestinal  bacterial load is an age and host genotype-related phenotype that can be used to predict c. elegans lifespan. by analysis of mutants, we begin to establish a hierarchy of the host immune genes that have greatest effect on the intestinal milieu, and thus on longevity.

RESULTS
role of daf- <dig> insulin-signaling pathway on c. elegans lifespan
under typical laboratory conditions at 25°c on ngm agar plates with a lawn of e. coli strain op <dig>  a culture of wild type  c. elegans has a lifespan of ~  <dig> weeks  <cit> . lifespans are shorter when lawns are composed of bacteria that are more pathogenic for humans  <cit> ; conversely, host mutations that increase resistance to bacterial infection prolong c. elegans lifespan  <cit> . first, we confirmed  <cit>  and extended these observations by analyzing the effect on lifespan of the daf- <dig> signaling pathway in c. elegans exposed to e. coli op <dig> or the more pathogenic s. typhimurium strain sl <dig>  we sought to confirm whether under the experimental conditions we used, there is a survival difference for worms grown on lawns of e. coli op <dig> or s. typhimurium sl <dig>  as expected, the average survival in days  for n <dig> worms exposed to s. typhimurium sl <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days, significantly  shorter than when exposed to e. coli op <dig>   <cit>  . next, we examined whether we also could find the expected differences in lifespan according to worm genotype. as expected, for both the e. coli and s. typhimurium strains, lifespan was significantly reduced for the daf- <dig> mutants, but significantly increased for the daf- <dig> and age- <dig> mutants, compared to wild type . these findings, confirming prior observations  <cit> , indicate the importance to lifespan of both bacterial strain and worm genotype related to intestinal immunity.

a worms were age-synchronized by a bleaching procedure. embryos were placed on mngm agar plates containing e. coli op <dig> or s. typhimurium sl <dig> and incubated at 25°c. the l <dig> stage was designated as day  <dig>  a total of  <dig> worms were used per lifespan assay. bacterial colonization of the intestinal tract was determined at day  <dig> by washing and grinding  <dig> worms, and plating worm lysates on macconkey agar. all assays were performed at least three times

bacteria accumulate in the c. elegans intestine with aging
as worms age, bacteria accumulate in the intestinal tract  <cit> . however, quantitative relationships between worm genotype, lifespan, and intestinal lumen bacterial proliferation have not been examined. we hypothesized that intestinal environments that are less favorable for bacterial colonization and accumulation predict longer worm lifespan.

to investigate the relationship of bacterial load to c. elegans mortality, we measured the numbers of viable bacteria  recovered across the lifespan from the c. elegans intestine. as n <dig> worms grown on an e. coli op <dig> lawn age, the intestinal load increases from <  <dig> e. coli cfu/worm on day  <dig>  to  <dig> cfu/worm by day  <dig> and remains at that level through day  <dig> , and at least as far as day  <dig> when > 50% of worms have died . similar trends were observed when n <dig> worms were grown on salmonella sl <dig> lawns, but colonization reached higher  bacterial densities . thus, as worms age, bacterial loads rise but reach bacterial strain-specific plateaus, extending until their demise.

we next asked whether bacterial loads are affected by the daf- <dig> pathway. the daf- <dig> pathway mutants had colonization kinetics paralleling those for n <dig>  but the bacterial loads were often significantly different . the long-lived daf- <dig> mutants had about 10-fold lower colonization by both e. coli op <dig> and s. typhimurium sl <dig> than did n <dig> worms . in contrast, the daf- <dig> mutants had significantly higher densities, consistent with their decreased lifespans. these results suggest a relationship between day  <dig> colonization levels and ultimate mortality 6- <dig> days later. since lifespan extension of daf- <dig> mutants requires the daf- <dig> gene product  <cit> , using the daf-16;daf- <dig> double mutant, we asked whether daf- <dig> mutations also would affect the low bacterial loads of daf- <dig> mutants. we confirmed that the daf- <dig> mutation suppresses the lifespan extension of daf- <dig> mutant , and we now show that it suppresses the low daf- <dig> levels of bacterial colonization as well .

effects of host immunocompromise on bacterial proliferation and lifespan
next, we asked whether the role of the daf- <dig> pathway is unique, or whether other effectors of gut immunity also might play a role in bacterial accumulation. to approach this question, we examined worms with mutations in each of several important pathways in presumed c. elegans defenses against intestinal bacteria . we first studied the p <dig> map kinase pathway by analyzing pmk- <dig> mutants. pmk- <dig> is the c. elegans p <dig> homologue  <cit> , and the p <dig> map kinase cascade is involved in immune defenses to gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, as well as pathogenic fungi  <cit> . similarly, we studied the dbl- <dig> pathway using the dbl- <dig> mutant, whose product is homologous to mammalian transforming growth factor-β , and is implicated in pathogen resistance  <cit> . all receptors and smads from the dbl- <dig> pathway are strongly expressed in the intestine and/or pharynx of c. elegans  <cit> . we also examined mutants in tol- <dig>  the only toll-like receptor  in c. elegans, which is required for the full innate immune phenotype to certain gram-negative bacteria, for the full expression of abf- <dig>  a defensin-like molecule expressed in the pharynx  <cit> , and for avoiding pathogenic bacteria  <cit> .

the dbl- <dig> mutants showed both markedly reduced lifespan and elevated intestinal bacterial loads . in contrast, the pmk- <dig> and tol- <dig> mutants had significantly reduced lifespans, correlating with significantly elevated concentrations of s. typhimurium sl <dig>  although not with intestinal e. coli concentrations. these results indicate that across c. elegans genotypes, immunocompromise enhances bacterial loads, but is not sufficient to explain lifespan.

therefore, to examine the interactions between the dbl- <dig>  and the daf- <dig> insulin-signaling pathways, we constructed double mutant worms and analyzed both their longevity and bacterial load. compared with wild-type n <dig> strain, daf- <dig> mutants have increased lifespan and lower bacterial load, whereas the opposite was observed for the dbl- <dig> mutants . in the daf-2;dbl- <dig> double mutants, there is prolongation of longevity compared with dbl- <dig>  with reduction in bacterial load. the phenotypic interaction between the daf- <dig> and dbl- <dig> pathways indicates both playing roles in controlling bacterial load, with consequent effects on longevity.

role of downstream immune effector molecules on c. elegans longevity and intestinal bacterial load
since daf- <dig> is involved in regulating several antimicrobial proteins and antioxidant enzymes expressed in the intestinal tract  <cit> , we next addressed the role of the downstream effector molecules. c. elegans has  <dig> genes that encode lysozymes and  <dig> genes encoding saposin-like domains, of which lys- <dig>  lys- <dig> and spp- <dig> are regulated by the daf- <dig> pathway  <cit> . intestinal bacterial loads in lys- <dig> and spp- <dig> mutants were not significantly different from those in n <dig>  but both mutants had significantly decreased lifespan when grown on both the e. coli and salmonella lawns . for lys- <dig>  regulated by both the p <dig> map kinase and tgf-β pathways, mutants have significantly shortened lifespans . these results  indicate the importance of the encoded antimicrobial proteins in regulating lifespan, however, reduction in numbers of colonizing bacteria does not appear to be the sole mechanism for lifespan variation.

when ingesting bacterial cells, c. elegans also produce reactive oxygen species   <cit> . the extreme resistance of daf- <dig> mutants to bacterial accumulation may depend on oxidative stress response proteins  <cit> . to explore this relationship, we studied worms with mutations of sod- <dig>  encoding the anti-oxidant superoxide dismutase  <cit> , or of ctl- <dig>  a peroxisomal catalase  <cit> . the ctl- <dig> mutants had significantly decreased lifespan after exposure to either e. coli or salmonella, and had significantly higher salmonella density. in contrast, mutations in sod- <dig> had no effect on either lifespan or bacterial load .

thioredoxin is involved in maintaining reduced states inside cells  <cit> , and is involved in immune response regulation as well, by controlling nfκb and ap- <dig> binding  <cit> . the c. elegans thioredoxin  is expressed in neurons and in the intestine  <cit> ; recent studies suggest that trx- <dig> acts as a fluctuating neuronal signaling modulator within asj neurons to monitor the adjustment of neuropeptide expression, including insulin-like proteins, during dauer formation in response to adverse environmental conditions  <cit> . we found that worms with trx- <dig> mutations have significantly decreased lifespan when grown on e. coli or salmonella lawns , and significantly higher bacterial load in late adulthood . these studies indicate that control of intestinal bacterial load provides a mechanism to help understand how host tissue oxidative stress responses affect longevity and supports previous observations that neuronal communication mediates longevity control and innate immunity  <cit> .

distinct colonization patterns according to worm and bacterial genotype are observed in young c. elegans
we also considered whether the spatial pattern of intestinal colonization also might affect genotype-specific survival. to address this question, the profile of bacterial accumulation in the gut was examined by considering progressively distal regions of the nematode digestive tract . we found distinct patterns of colonization according to worm and bacterial genotype; for example, colonization of the posterior segments by the daf- <dig> and ctl- <dig> mutant worms was reduced compared with the more anterior segments. however, with worm aging, colonization levels generally equalized and became more homogeneous . the fluorescence and cfu determinations for day  <dig> intestinal e. coli op <dig> and s. typhimurium sl <dig> concentrations were strongly correlated . these results indicate that the localization of the large concentrations of cells observed in the intestines may correspond to the large numbers of viable bacteria.

relationship between c. elegans genotype, colonizing strain, and lifespan
to assess the biological significance of our observations, we sought to measure how consistent is the pathogenicity of bacterial strains in the lifespan and colonization relationships. the differences in virulence of salmonella and e. coli op <dig> for c. elegans, as reflected in lifespan measurements , permitted addressing these questions. across  <dig> genotypes related to worm intestinal immunity, lifespan was strongly correlated for the two bacterial strains  . the consistency of these results indicates the importance of host intestinal immunity genotypes in the consequences of the interactions with colonizing bacteria. to address whether intestinal bacterial load was a consistent predictor of lifespan, we assessed survival across worm genotypes, for the two bacterial species examined. first, we found that e. coli and salmonella densities were strongly correlated with one another across the studied genotypes related to intestinal immunity . for both organisms, there was an inverse correlation between day  <dig> bacterial density and survival . these strong relationships suggest that immune handling of bacterial load in the intestine of early adults is an important causative factor in determining lifespan. we chose day  <dig> to study, because colonization levels were significantly differed amongst the c. elegans mutants at that time point . however we also performed correlations between longevity and bacterial counts for other time points , as well as calculations based on a cox model, which takes into account bacterial accumulation over time . both results suggest that there exists a significant relationship between longevity and bacterial load throughout early adulthood.

relationships between introduced and surviving bacteria in worms with enhanced intestinal immunity
the c. elegans pharynx contains a grinder that breaks up bacterial cells to provide nutrients for the worm  <cit> . grinder-defective worms  have shortened lifespan  <cit> . we hypothesized that the reduced lifespan was related to increased accumulation of viable bacteria in the worm intestine. when grown on an e. coli op <dig> lawn, the number of viable bacterial cells recovered from the intestine of phm- <dig> mutants was about  <dig> e. coli cfu/worm at l <dig> stage , and increased to  <dig> cfu/worm by day  <dig> , ~10-fold higher than levels observed in n <dig> worms . a similar trend was observed when phm- <dig> mutants were grown on s. typhimurium sl <dig> lawns, but colonization reached higher bacterial densities, a difference paralleling the other worm genotypes . after day  <dig>  bacterial concentrations remain on a plateau , similar to the observations for the other genotypes.

in lifespan analysis, the td <dig> for phm- <dig> worms exposed to e. coli op <dig>  , was significantly  shorter than for n <dig> worms , and findings were parallel for salmonella , consistent with prior studies  <cit> . thus, the grinder-deficient worms delivered more viable bacteria to the c. elegans intestine, and lifespan was reduced compared to n <dig> for worms grown on either e. coli or salmonella lawns.

the long-lived c. elegans daf- <dig> mutants are resistant to bacterial pathogens  <cit>  and as shown above, have significantly lower levels of bacterial colonization ; these worms have a significantly delayed decline in pharyngeal pumping  <cit> . thus, daf- <dig> mutants could be more resistant to bacterial colonization simply because their pharynx remains functional for an extended period of time, or alternatively, because their intestinal milieu is more antimicrobial. to address this question, we constructed daf-2;phm- <dig> double mutants. we found that young daf-2;phm- <dig> double mutants have significantly higher bacterial loads than the wild type and daf- <dig> single mutants, resembling the phm- <dig> single mutants ; thus, early on, the phm- <dig> phenotype dominates. however, as the daf-2;phm- <dig> mutants age, they become increasingly capable of controlling bacterial colonization, with accumulation levels diminishing to the daf- <dig> level. furthermore, their overall lifespan is very similar to the lifespan of daf- <dig> single mutants when exposed to e. coli . similar trends, although with a more intermediate phenotype, were observed when the worms were exposed to salmonella lawns , indicating that the daf- <dig> phenotypes ultimately become dominant. thus, in the presence of enhanced intestinal immunity, the number of delivered bacterial cells has no long-term effect on bacterial load or on longevity.

to extend these observations, the profile of bacterial accumulation in the intestinal lumen after feeding e. coli op <dig> expressing gfp was studied. as before, e. coli accumulated in the intestine of n <dig> worms as they aged, leading to a marked distension of the intestinal lumen by day  <dig> . the daf- <dig> and phm- <dig> single mutants showed contrasting phenotypes, with no bacterial accumulation detected by day  <dig> and noticeable bacterial packing from day  <dig>  respectively. the kinetics of bacterial accumulation observed in the daf-2;phm- <dig> double mutants correlated with the cfu quantitation , indicating increasing control of bacterial load over time.

relationships between introduced and surviving bacteria in worms with decreased intestinal immunity
to examine the effect of both increased bacterial delivery to the intestine and decreased immunity, we created a pharynx defective  and immunocompromised  double mutant  <cit> . as before, the dbl- <dig> single mutant showed a difference in bacterial load compared with n <dig> , as well as a decreased lifespan reflecting their diminished immunity . bacterial load on day  <dig>  were markedly  higher in the dbl-1;phm- <dig> double mutants than in the dbl- <dig> single mutant and n <dig> wild type worms, and  <dig> times higher than in the phm- <dig> single mutant . as worms grew older, they were ill-appearing; by day  <dig>  they had decreased body movement and coordination, decreased pharyngeal pumping, and showed a dramatic reduction in survival . the bacterial concentrations did not increase as much as the phm- <dig> single mutants, most likely because they were feeding poorly. the early life results indicate that the dbl- <dig> pathway and the pharynx have additive effects in control of bacterial load, with drastic effects on survival when both are interrupted.

effect of mitochondrial function on bacterial proliferation and lifespan
finally, we asked whether intestinal bacterial load is affected by genes known to have effects on lifespan that are independent of gut immunity. ubiquinone  biosynthesis, essential in mitochondrial respiration, requires demethoxyubiquinone hydroxylase, encoded by clk- <dig>  <cit> . c. elegans clk- <dig> mutants that generate diminished amounts of reactive oxygen species  and subsequent reduced levels of oxidative damage  <cit> , have prolonged lifespans and resistance to stress induced by uv irradiation, heat, or reactive oxygen  <cit> . inactivation of clk- <dig> results in an average slowing of a number of developmental and physiological processes, including cell cycle, embryogenesis, post-embryonic growth, rhythmic behaviors, and aging  <cit> . no role in innate immunity has been described so far.

as predicted, the clk- <dig> mutants had a prolonged lifespan compared to n <dig>  when grown on lawns of e. coli op <dig> .we then assessed whether clk- <dig> affects intestinal bacterial accumulation. we found that the clk- <dig> mutants had intestinal e. coli concentrations that were not significantly different from wild type worms , consistent with the independence of its longevity phenotype on intestinal bacterial accumulation.

genetic analyses have provided evidence that lifespan extension by clk- <dig> is distinct from the daf- <dig> signaling pathway, since daf-2;clk- <dig> double mutants live much longer than either single mutant, and mutations in clk- <dig> cannot be suppressed by daf- <dig> loss-of-function mutations  <cit> . first, we confirmed that the daf-2;clk- <dig> double mutant has prolonged survival compared to either single mutant . we next considered the interplay of the clk- <dig> and the daf- <dig> pathways in relation to intestinal bacterial density. we found that the daf-2;clk- <dig> double mutant had intestinal bacterial concentrations that mirror daf- <dig> single mutants , suggesting clk- <dig> plays no role on intestinal bacterial accumulation. that the double mutant has longer survival than either single mutant  indicates independence of their longevity mechanisms.

discussion
to better understand aging, we studied intestinal bacterial accumulation in c. elegans differing in the bacterial species that they ingest, as well as their genotype and maturation. here, we provide evidence that the extent of intestinal bacterial accumulation early in adulthood, which is controlled by gut immunity that decreases with age, is strongly and inversely correlated with longevity.

bacteria are the source of nutrition for c. elegans, but ultimately as the worms age, viable bacteria accumulate in the intestine  <cit> . worms grown on the soil bacterium bacillus subtilis have a longer lifespan compared to those grown on e. coli op <dig> or many other tested bacterial species  <cit> . however, worms that are grown on b. subtilis spores produce fewer eggs and are smaller and thinner than those fed on vegetative cells of b. subtilis or e. coli op <dig>  <cit> . this observation indicates that growth on spores compared to vegetative  bacterial cells limits nutrient availability. thus, vegetative bacteria represent two competing elements to c. elegans: a nutrient that fosters development and fecundity, and a toxic component that may reduce lifespan  <cit> . worm defenses, including the pharyngeal grinder and intestinal immunity, act to mitigate the latter phenomenon.

the nematode responds to bacteria with conserved innate immune responses, however, aging is accompanied by a decline of immune functions  <cit> . this may represent a general evolutionary process, since after reproductive age individuals compete with their own progeny for available nutrients. although the functionality of the c. elegans immune system during aging has been extensively examined  <cit> , we now have simultaneously examined longevity and control of bacterial proliferation across worm genotype, age, and bacterial strain differences. we confirm that viable bacteria accumulate in the c. elegans intestine as they age  <cit> , and now show that both bacterial strain type and worm genotype related to gut immunity affect intestinal bacterial accumulation, which might play a significant role in lifespan determination, since we found that lifespan and bacterial load are inversely correlated. previous studies had quantified bacterial proliferation by cfu enumeration only in n <dig> worms  <cit> . more recent studies showed substantially fewer bacteria in the gut of certain long-lived c. elegans mutants; however, these observations were by semi-quantitative microscopy only  <cit> . by quantitatively characterizing the kinetics of bacterial proliferation in the c. elegans intestine, in wild type and mutant worms, we establish a basis to better dissect the interplay of bacteria, host genotypes, and age.

one of the aims in this study was to characterize the kinetics of intestinal bacterial colonization. salmonella is a pathogen of c. elegans that permits examining this question since it kills worms relatively slowly, rather than in a rapid manner. however, other than consistently higher numbers, there were few cases in which salmonella and e. coli results differed greatly. these differ from previous data that reported significant differences in the lifespan of c. elegans when grown on salmonella compared to e. coli  <cit> . the discrepancy might be explained in part by differences in methodology, since in this work we grew the worms on lawns of salmonella rather than exposing them as l4's. however, e.coli also is pathogenic to c. elegans  <cit> , and many c. elegans antimicrobial genes are induced, some even more strongly  than in the presence of other pathogens  <cit> . as such, e. coli is just one other bacterial species to which c. elegans can sense and respond.

in our experimental system, we found significant differences in bacterial accumulation at day  <dig> of adult life, and that variation in the intestinal bacterial loads among the immunodeficient mutants correlated with lifespan differences. why were differences in bacterial proliferation significant at day 2? one explanation is that since c. elegans produces nearly all of its progeny within the first  <dig> days of its adult life  <cit> , immunity is tightly regulated during development and early adult life, but not post-reproductively. consistent with this, a striking decrease in expression of pmk- <dig> regulated genes and a decline in pmk- <dig> levels in aging animals was recently described  <cit> , suggesting a diminished role for pmk- <dig> pathway in host defense towards the end of life. therefore, a decline in immune function in late adult life may either be non-selected, or may be selected at a population level, since as discussed above, non-reproducing worms limit population numbers and stability, since they compete with their progeny for resources  <cit> . the longevity of c. elegans in the wild is substantially  shorter than under laboratory conditions  <cit> ; it is probable that most worms die just after laying eggs, since nutrient availability usually is limiting in natural settings.

if the immune system of c. elegans experiences an age-related decline  <cit> , which is accompanied by other age-related changes such as pharyngeal deterioration and reduced defecation  <cit> , why does the bacterial load reach a strain-specific  plateau that extends until their demise? one possibility is that a cohort effect exists, in which the fraction of worms examined in late worm adulthood constitutes a subpopulation that survived because they maintain the ability to control bacterial proliferation. alternatively, late in life the bacterial populations develop specific syntrophic equilibria  <cit>  that are resilient to changes in host milieu.

that the long-lived daf- <dig> mutants resist intestinal bacterial accumulation may be due to enhanced expression of luminal antimicrobial proteins and antioxidant enzymes as evidenced using dna microarray analysis  <cit> . consistent with this hypothesis, we found that mutants lacking expression of the antimicrobial proteins lys- <dig> and spp- <dig>  and the oxidative stress response enzyme ctl- <dig> had diminished lifespan. since c. elegans immune responses generate ros when bacterial pathogens are ingested  <cit> , oxidative stress responses may aid in resistance by protecting against ros-induced tissue damage. thus, antioxidants in the gut protect from oxidative stress, preserving adequate intestinal cell function. the ctl- <dig> mutants also had significantly higher s. typhimurium density, consistent with an ros resistance model. however, the intestinal bacterial densities of lys- <dig>  lys- <dig>  and spp- <dig> worms were not significantly different from n <dig>  one explanation might be redundancy of the antimicrobial protein genes  in c. elegans. if the numerous genes act in concert, the increased longevity of the daf- <dig> mutants might reflect synergies of individual genes that exert relatively small effects on lifespan and on bacterial colonization. although the daf- <dig> effect also could reflect reduced senescence of the pharyngeal apparatus or defective pumping, the mixed phenotype of the daf-2;phm- <dig> mutant provides evidence against that hypothesis, and supports the role of enhanced expression of luminal antimicrobial proteins and antioxidant enzymes in controlling bacterial accumulation and ultimately longevity. that the colonization phenotypes of the daf-2;phm- <dig> double mutants is virtually identical to phm- <dig> early in adult life, but with aging, the daf- <dig> effects dominate, indicate the importance of pharyngeal function early in adult life, but that intestinal immune responses dominate as worms become senescent.

thioredoxin expression may enhance longevity, since transgenic mice expressing human trx- <dig> live longer  <cit> . we confirm that trx- <dig> mutants have significantly decreased lifespan  <cit> , and found that intestinal bacterial density was greater in late adulthood  when compared to n <dig>  trx- <dig> may affect c. elegans longevity and bacterial load due to its antioxidant properties  <cit> , or alternately by modulation of redox-sensitive transcription factors, such as ap- <dig>  that are activated during aging. the fact that bacterial load was greater in late adulthood is consistent with significantly enhanced expression of intestinal trx- <dig> expression as worms age  <cit> .

for other effectors of gut immunity, such as those encoded by dbl- <dig> and pmk- <dig>  the effects on bacterial load and longevity were strongly inverse. we found that pmk- <dig> mutants have a shorter lifespan than previously reported  <cit> . differences in lifespan may be due to different experimental conditions. troemel et al. added 5-fluorodeoxyuridine  to ngm plates seeded with op <dig>  to prevent c. elegans progeny. however, fudr acts to inhibit dna synthesis, and also inhibits bacterial proliferation  <cit> . that abrogating two host anti-bacterial mechanisms  produces very short survival indicates synergism between anatomical and immune defenses.

we found a strong correlation between bacterial counts and lifespan. however to better understand the biology of this host-microbial relationship, it would be critical to distinguish between continuing accumulation vs. bacterial proliferation. we address this point in a second manuscript, where we created model systems to evaluate between the possibility of bacterial persistence and proliferation or new bacterial entry  <cit> . we found that host age as well as bacterial strain determine the nature of bacterial persistence in the c. elegans intestine. we also provide evidence for active competition in vivo for colonization sites as well as evidence for in vivo bacterial adaptation. we propose two mechanisms to explain the strong inverse correlation between bacterial load and lifespan. first, the intestinal milieu of older worms is more permissive for bacterial cells in general. second, over time there is selection for bacteria that are better adapted to the intestinal niche. our two studies provide support for both mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
we performed quantitative studies to determine intestinal bacterial load in c. elegans and found a strong correlation between bacterial counts and lifespan. we showed that as adult worms age, they lose their capacity to control bacterial accumulation, and provide evidence that intestinal bacterial load, regulated by gut immunity may play a role in lifespan determination. in total, these studies focus attention on the worm intestine as a locus that influences longevity in the presence of an accumulating bacterial population. further studies defining the interplay between bacterial species and host immunity in c. elegans may provide insights into the general mechanisms of aging and age-related diseases.
