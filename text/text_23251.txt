BACKGROUND
lactic acid bacteria  are a heterogeneous group of bacteria extensively used as starter cultures for the fermented foods development. because of their metabolism, this group of bacteria can improve the safety, shelf life, nutritional value, flavour and overall quality of fermented products. some strains have shown to exert a large range of beneficial properties in humans, and they are frequently used as probiotic microorganisms. in addition, certain lab strains are able to produce and release compounds with biological activity in foods, sometimes referred as nutraceuticals  <cit> . these micronutrients are used as a cofactor in numerous enzymatic reactions, as it is the case of vitamin b <dig> 

conceptually, the definition of vitamin b <dig> generally describes a type of cobalt corrinoid, belonging to the cobalamin  group. on the other hand, vitamin b <dig> is the form of the vitamin obtained during process of industrial production but this form not exists in the nature  <cit> . naturally, this compound is found as desoxyadenosilcobalamin , methylcobalamin or pseudocobalamin, among other forms. concerning the structure, the cobalamin molecule present  <dig> parts main:  the central corrinic ring with the four ligands of a cobalt ion,  a superior  ligand that is attached to adenosyl o methyl group, and  the lower ligand , usually dimethylbenzimidazole . it has been described that in some anaerobic bacteria, the adenine and other ligands can replace dmb giving as a result pseudocobalamin  and other active cofactors  <cit> . this soluble compound is one of the most complex non-polymeric macromolecules produced in the cell and only a reduced group of bacteria and archaea are able to synthesize it. the bacteria present in the rumen of cattle, sheep and other ruminants are the responsible of its synthesis. humans do not have such microbiota in their large intestine and must absorb the coenzyme from natural sources such as meat, fish, eggs, and pharmaceutical products  <cit> . a diet sufficient in vitamin b <dig> is essential to prevent severe pathologies  some of which are irreversible . thus, the use of vitamin-producer bacteria appears as an appropriate alternative to produce innovative foods with added nutritional value  <cit> . however, the production of vitamin b <dig> is strain specific and an unusual trait present in certain strains of the lactobacillus genus. the production of this metabolite by lactobacillus reuteri strains has been described for the first time by us and confirmed later by others authors . moreover, we validated that the corrinoid  produced by l. reuteri crl  <dig> is effective in preventing the hematological and neurological pathologies  caused by a diet deficiency in vitamin b <dig> in a combined animal model   <cit> . more recently, de angelis et al.  <cit>  described the production and the genetic organization of the complete de novo biosynthetic pathway of vitamin b <dig> in lactobacillus rossiae dsm  <dig>  among other lactobacilli, previous evidence suggested that two strains of l. coryniformis  are capable of producing the antimicrobial compound reuterin  <cit> , an enzymatic pathway that involves a cobalamin-dependent enzyme, the glycerol dehydratase  <cit> . no further analysis related to vitamin b <dig> production was carried out in those studies. based on this previous evidence, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the vitamin b <dig> production in l. coryniformis crl  <dig>  a heterofermentative strain isolated from silage. firstly, the compound with cobalamin activity was isolated and biochemically characterized. next, the genome of the crl  <dig> strain was sequenced by whole genome shotgun  sequencing strategy and the identification of putative biosynthetic operon involved in the synthesis of the corrinoid was performed by in silico analysis. finally, a detailed comparative study of the cobalamin gene cluster of l. coryniformis crl  <dig> with those of previously known vitamin-producer strains was performed. the results of this research provide the first evidence of vitamin b <dig> synthesis by a l. coryniformis strain.

RESULTS
cobalamin production by l. coryniformis crl 1001
in order to evidence the production of cobalamin by l. coryniformis crl  <dig>  we use s. typhimurium ar  <dig>   <cit>  as indicator strain, grown in minimal medium without vitamin b <dig> according the methodology described by taranto et al.  <cit> . the results of the bioassay showed that the cobalamin requirements of the indicator strain were corrected when cell extracts  of l. coryniformis crl  <dig> were added; the halo diameter obtained was similar to that obtained with a solution of standard cyanocobalamin . on the other hand, no growth was detected when the ce from lactobacillus plantarum atcc  <dig>  was used. these results would indicate that l. coryniformis crl  <dig> is able to produce compounds with cobalamin activity.

to identify the compound with cobalamin activity produced by l. coryniformis crl  <dig>  the ce was analysed by rp-hplc. the uv-dad spectra data revealed the presence of two main peaks that showed similar characteristics with the spectrum obtained for the peak belonging to the cn-cbl standard. the retention times  of these peaks were slightly lower  to the rt of standard solution of cn-cbl  . however, when these peaks were collected and analysed using the bioassay, they showed the same ability of vitamin b <dig> complementation than the cn-cbl standard. for this reason, we continued with the identification of both peaks.fig.  <dig> rp-hplc chromatogram of the cell extract  from l. coryniformis crl  <dig> ; cn-cbl standard . uv-dad spectrum and bioassay images  of cn-cbl standard and each corrinoid produced by crl  <dig> strain




characterization of the corrinoid produced by l. coryniformis crl 1001
corrinoid compounds separated by hplc were analysed by liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry . the mass module parameters were fine-tuned and optimized with commercial standard of cn-cbl. the transition  <dig>   ++ to  <dig>   corresponds to the lower ligand, whose dmb is the aglycon attached to ribofuranose 3-phosphate whereas the transition  <dig>   ++ to  <dig>   corresponds to the base dmb. data transition for pseudo-b <dig> were estimated and calculated according the bibliography as follows:  <dig>   ++ to  <dig>  ; this transition corresponds to the lower ligand where adenine is the aglycon attached to ribofuranose 3-phosphate, and the transition  <dig>   ++ to  <dig>   corresponds to the base adenine  <cit> . both transitions were sought in the ms and ms/ms spectra of the peaks with cobalamin activity.

the ms spectra of the active peaks obtained by hplc indicated that a double charged ion with an approximately m/z of  <dig> ++ was prominent in the two spectra . the ms/ms spectrum indicated that the dominant ions with a value approximate m/z  <dig>  were attributable to the substitution in the lower ligand where the adenine is the aglycon attached to ribofuranose 3-phosphate.fig.  <dig> liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry  chromatograms of peaks with cobalamin activity from l. coryniformis crl  <dig>  the transitions are shown together . total ion chromatogram  of the two active peaks, rt  <dig>  min  and rt  <dig>  min  and ms/ms spectrum from m/z  <dig> to  <dig> of the peak with rt  <dig>  min with ms/ms spectrum showing the transitions




the ms showed that the molecular species  synthesized by l. coryniformis crl  <dig> corresponds mainly to coα--coβ-cyanocobamide, commonly known as pseudo-b <dig>  an analogue with a structure very similar to vitamin b <dig>  in this corrinoid, the dmb moiety is substituted by adenine as lower ligand. this compound is a physiologically important form of the vitamin b <dig> in various microorganisms  <cit> .

the concentration of pseudo-b <dig> produced by l. coryniformis crl  <dig> was calculated indirectly using a standard curve made with different concentrations of a commercial cn-cbl. the area of the peaks obtained in the chromatograms corresponds to approximately  <dig>  μg ml− <dig> of pseudo-b <dig> produced.

genome identification of vitamin b <dig> cluster in l. coryniformis crl 1001
the genome sequence of l. coryniformis crl  <dig> consisted on  <dig> contigs with a total size of  <dig> , <dig> base pairs and an average gc content of 42 %. the structural and functional annotation performed with the rapid annotations using subsystems technology  server  <cit>  allowed us to identify  <dig> coding sequences  and  <dig> structural rnas   <cit> . additionally, it was observed that  <dig> subsystems that include the 44 % of the identified cds are represented in the chromosome.


in silico genomic analyses revealed the presence of  <dig> open reading frames  related to the coenzyme b <dig> production  located immediately adjacent to the pdu operon  which encodes the enzymes necessary for the use of glycerol or propanediol as carbon source . as described in other species, the close association of these two gene clusters is probably a reflection of the requirements of cobalamin or its corrinoid derivatives for the use of propanodiol  <cit> . almost all predicted genes  are in the same orientation, except for pocr, which encodes for a transcriptional regulator with 45 % identity and 69 % positive matches at the amino acid level, with its homolog in l. reuteri jcm  <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the two clusters  have a few intergenic regions and their average g + c content  differ from that of the draft genome sequence of l. coryniformis crl  <dig> . as described by morita et al.  <cit>  for l. reuteri jcm  <dig>  this data could explain the existence of a genomic island acquired through horizontal gene transfer.fig.  <dig> schematic representation of the pdu and cbi-cob-hem clusters of l. coryniformis crl  <dig>  the arrows represent genes involved in: synthesis of uroporphyrinogen iii , synthesis of cobinamide, lower ligand and cobalt transport , propanediol degradation  and pocr, a transcriptional regulator . on the simplified b <dig> synthesis pathway scheme, genes encoding proteins involved in synthesis of coenzyme  and synthesis and transport of intermediaries  are highlighted




among pdu genes, pduc, pdud and pdue were found. these genes encode for the three subunits of the glycerol dehydratase, an enzyme that requires cobalamin as a cofactor for performing it catalytic activity  <cit> . additionally, a gene coding for the l-threonine kinase pdux, was localized. this protein, described in salmonella enterica, transfers a phosphoryl group to a free l-threonine and it is involved in de novo synthesis of adenosyl cobalamin and the assimilation of cobyric acid   <cit> .

downstream of the pdu operon, seventeen cbi genes  and cysg gene were in silico identified. the proteins encoded by these genes are required in most of the reactions that take place in the cell during the corrinoid ring synthesis of the cobalamin molecule  <cit> .

regarding cob genes coba, d, u, s and c were found. coba encodes an adenosyltransferase, a binding protein of adenosyl group as β-ligand  <cit> . the gene cobd encodes an l-threonine-o-3-phosphate descarboxylase that is involved in the amino-propanol arm synthesis  <cit>  while cob u, s and c encode the proteins that participate in the attachment of the amino-propanol arm and in the assembly of the nucleotide loop that connects the lower cobalt ligand to the corrinoid ring  <cit> .

finally, downstream of the cbi and cob genes, five hem genes  were detected in a similar way as observed for other microorganisms that produce cobalamin anaerobically  <cit> . the proteins encoded by these genes are involved in the first steps of the cobalamin biosynthesis, the synthesis of uroporphyrinogen iii from l-glutamyl-trna. at the same time, the hemd/coba gene, encoding a single polypeptide with both uroporphyrinogen iii synthase and methyltransferase activity was detected  <cit> .

interestingly, the genome of l. coryniformis crl  <dig> lacks cobt gene, contrary to that observed in the cobalamin biosynthetic cluster of l. reuteri crl  <dig>  <cit> . instead, two cbl genes were detected, cbls and cblt, encoding for a α-ribazole phosphoribosyl kinase and a α-ribazole transporter, respectively. these results might suggest an alternative pathway for α-ribazole salvaging and the α-ribazole-p synthesis in l. coryniformis crl  <dig>  as it is described in listeria  <cit> .

in silico comparative analysis of the biosynthetic cluster of vitamin b12
the cobalamin biosynthetic gene cluster has been identified in a few lactobacillus species, including l. reuteri  <cit>  and more recently in l. rossiae  <cit> . both strains are obligate hetero-fermentative lab  <cit> . l. coryniformis crl  <dig> is the first facultative heterofermentative strain described as cobalamin producer.

comparative genomic studies among l. coryniformis crl  <dig>  l. reuteri dsm  <dig> and l. rossiae dsm  <dig> strains evidenced a conserved genetic organization of the coenzyme b <dig> biosynthetic genes. in these three strains, the cbi-cob-hem cluster is adjacent to the pdu cluster . however, contrasting other cobalamin producer strains, this two gene sets  have an opposite orientation in the l. rossiae genome. morita et al.  <cit>  suggested that both gene cluster might have been acquired by horizontal transfer and inserted independently in these genomes.fig.  <dig> linear comparison of the pdu cluster and the cbi-cob-hem cluster between l. coryniformis crl  <dig>  l. reuteri dsm  <dig>  and l. rossie dsm  <dig> . genes in the gene clusters are depicted by arrows indicating the transcription direction. genes conserved between the three genomes are colored in grey and black bars indicating orthologous regions




as previously described for cobalamin producer anaerobic strains, the hem genes were located among the cbi-cob genes in all the organisms under comparison.

the cbls and cblt genes identified in the genome of l. coryniformis were also detected in the genome of l. rossiae where they have an identical localization in the cbi-cob-hem cluster. however, these genes are absent in the genome of l. reuteri. the cobt gene, encoding a nicotinate mononucleotide : base phosphoribosyltransferase, has only been described in this latter specie for the strains l. reuteri crl  <dig> , l. reuteri jcm  <dig>  and l. reuteri dsm  <dig> .

until now, among the lactobacillus strains described as cobalamin producers, l. coryniformis crl  <dig> is the only strain harbouring the gene encoding for pdux on its genome .

a comparative analysis between the deduced amino acid sequences of each orf included in the vitamin b <dig> biosynthetic cluster of l. coryniformis crl  <dig> and those from l. rossiae, l. reuteri, listeria sp. and salmonella sp. using the blastp algorithm, was performed. we found that most of l. coryniformis crl  <dig> proteins have the highest percentage of identity with those identified in l. rossiae strain , with the exception of cobd and pdux, which were more similar to listeria proteins. this result indicates that the amino-propanol phosphate synthesis from l-threonine in l. coryniformis crl  <dig> is similar to that performed by listeria strains, previously described by fan et al.  <cit> . these results suggest an alternative vitamin b <dig> biosynthetic pathway in this genus.table  <dig> comparative analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of each orf involved in vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis cluster of lactobacillus coryniformis crl  <dig> with those present in other cobalamin producer strains

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we demonstrated for the first time that l. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis crl  <dig> is able to produce corrinoids with cobalamin activity. the chemical characterization of the molecule isolated from crl  <dig> ce using hplc and mass spectrometry show that the majority of corrinoid produced is pseudocobalamin that has adenine like coα-ligand instead  <dig> -dimethylbenzimidazole. this molecule is one of the forms of coenzyme b <dig> occurring in nature. genomic studies revealed the presence of the complete anaerobic biosynthetic pathway of coenzyme b <dig>  the comparative analysis of the cobalamin gene cluster of l. coryniformis crl  <dig> with those present in strains previously described as vitamin producers, revealed that this strain bears the genes cbls-cblt only present in the genome of l. rossiae dsm  <dig>  moreover, pdux gene has not been detected in another strain of the lactobacillus genus. the results of this work provide the first evidence of vitamin b <dig> synthesis by a l. coryniformis strain.
