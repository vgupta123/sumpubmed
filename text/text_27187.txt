BACKGROUND
recent discussions on the value of in vivo rodent bioassays for risk assessment and risk extrapolation to humans demonstrate the growing uneasiness of using rodents as surrogates for humans. indeed humans are not 70 kg rodents and thus it does not come as a surprise that rodents differ physiologically and anatomically dramatically from humans  <cit> . the ever growing number of well characterized species-and sex-specific mechanisms of toxicity and carcinogenicity in rodents that have no comparison to and thus no relevance for humans, e.g. the α2u-globulin nephropathy/carcinogenesis  <cit> , sodium-glucose linked transporter  inhibitor mediated renal carcinogenesis in mice or rats  <cit> , d-amino acid oxidase  droplet nephropathy in male and female rats  <cit>  etc. are testimony of the problems associated with using in vivo rodent bioassays to understand mechanisms of toxicity and the extrapolation of potential risk to humans. similarly, the use of rodent primary cells in vitro, albeit providing for a more defined and controlled testing system, is subject to the same restrictions with regard to the extrapolation of findings to the human situation. consequently, there has been a recent emphasis on employing human primary cells as well as cell lines to allow delineation of the underlying mechanisms of toxicity. while human cell lines are derived from either cancer cells or have been transformed using viral genes or dna alkylating or oxidizing reactions and thus bear little resemblance to ‘normal’ human cells, employing human primary cells would be the most optimal solution. however, human primary cells are difficult to obtain in sufficient amounts for obvious reasons and thus demand thinking of potential alternatives.

indeed, the porcine kidney is anatomically and physiologically comparable with the human  <cit>  and can be obtained without real restrictions and at relatively low costs. more importantly one of the real caveats in using cells in vitro is the variable expression of transporters, the type of transporters expressed, the level of expression, the homology/amino acid identity and tertiary and quaternary structures of the transporters as well as the transporter type distribution within a given anatomical subunit e.g. the proximal tubule epithelial cells at the basal membrane of the luminal surface. indeed, of the many human transporters known, at least the fully sequenced porcine transporters have a higher structural/amino acid identity to the human homologues than those of either mice or rats . the latter is also critical when kinetics as well as dynamics of given compounds that need active or passive transport across membranes are considered, as the higher the homology to the human transporter the higher the likelihood that transport affinity and capacity are similar in the human and porcine homologues for the compound. this assumption is supported by data available for oat <dig> and to some extent also for oat <dig>  whereas for other transporters insufficient data is available for comparison . however, in order to employ primary porcine kidney cells  and their subsequent cell strain for compound assessment it is crucial to demonstrate the types and levels of transporters expressed, their functionality  as well as their consistent expression over several cell culture passages. in order to address the latter points of characterization, primary pkc were generated from kidneys obtained from german hybrid pigs and cultured over several days and passages. the latter resulted in a pkc cell strain with a finite lifespan according to the traditional definition  <cit> . moreover, as transporters are expressed at the basolateral or luminal side of renal epithelial cells only, compounds for testing transport functionality were chosen that need two differently localized transporters for cellular uptake and excretion, respectively. finally in order to determine whether the expression of given transporters are hormone or substrate dependent, specific treatments were employed to detect differences in expression transporter levels.

in addition, two continuous cell lines of rat  and porcine  origin that are often used in in vitro renal toxicology were run alongside for comparison.

animal tissue and cell cultures
whole kidneys from fresh-killed male improved german hybrid pigs were obtained from a local slaughter-house. primary porcine kidney cells  were prepared by collagenase digestion from renal cortices and cultured as previously described in detail  <cit>  with the difference that the percoll step employed in the original method was omitted. briefly, a piece of renal cortex was minced in ice-cold modified hank’s buffered salt solution  containing  <dig>  mm egta and  <dig>  u l- <dig> penicillin and 200 mg l- <dig> streptomycin sulfate . after washing in hbss-egta, the tissue was digested with collagenase  in hbss  containing 4 mm cacl <dig> and 1 mm mgcl <dig> at 37°c with gentle agitation for 20-30 minutes. thereafter, the cell suspension was filtered through 200 μm and 40 μm gauze and washed twice with hbss. the final cell pellet was resuspended in dmem-d-val , to suppress fibroblast growth, supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fbs  and antibiotics  and seeded into primaria™ plasticware. cultures were maintained in a standard humidified atmosphere . medium was exchanged every second day and after one week, medium was replaced by dmem/f <dig> medium  supplemented with 10% fbs and antibiotics. cells were passaged using trypsin-edta and cells were then seeded onto standard cell culture plastics.

cell viability was estimated using the trypan blue exclusion assay. only preparations of ≥90% viability were used for culturing. cell origin was determined by enzyme distribution, as described earlier in detail  <cit> , using γ-glutamyl-transferase and hexokinase activity as markers for proximal and distal tubular origin, respectively. only cell preparations of predominantly proximal tubular origin  were used for culture.

llc-pk <dig> and nrk-52e cells were obtained from the european collection of cell cultures, salisbury, uk  and from the dsmz, braunschweig, germany , respectively. cell lines were cultured in standard plastic ware with dmem  containing 10% fbs and antibiotics  under standard humidified conditions .

cell culture samples for rna and protein extraction were prepared by standard trypsin-edta treatment followed by washing with pbs. resulting cell pellets were snap-frozen and stored at -80°c until use. renal tissue samples were obtained from a male wistar rat  and from a male german hybrid pig , snap-frozen and stored at -80°c until use.

growth curves
cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 5 ×  <dig> cells cm- <dig> and medium was replaced every 48 hours. three wells were counted  daily from day 1- <dig>  using a z <dig> particle counter  after trypsin-edta treatment.

cytotoxicity experiments
cytotoxicity experiments using the mtt reduction assay as previously described  <cit> , were conducted to estimate non-toxic concentrations for subsequent analyses. all chemicals and stock solutions  were sterilized by filtration  prior to testing. briefly, after incubating the cells in the presence of mtt  at 37°c for  <dig>  hours, the supernatant was discarded and the intracellular formazan was solubilized with 95%  isopropanol/ 5%  formic acid. absorbance was read at 550 nm using a microplate reader .

data represent n = 3- <dig> independent experiments, conducted in duplicate. one-way anova with dunnett’s multiple comparison test .

cytotoxicity was determined in the kinetic experiments  after 24 hr substrate exposure, thereby ensuring that a substrate exposure of up to 30 min will not encompass substrate cytotoxicity. conversely, in the transport induction experiments  cytotoxicity was determined after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 96 hours of exposure. all assays were performed with the respective vehicle controls  and cadmium chloride as positive control.

transporter induction experiments
for transporter induction experiments, freshly isolated pkc cells were seeded  on 6-well thincert pet tissue culture inserts in standard culture medium and medium was changed every 48 hours. cell cultures formed a tight monolayer on day  <dig> of culture, which was confirmed microscopically before use. at this time point medium was changed again and incubations with potential transporter inducers were started by adding  <dig> nm or 1 μm of bromosulphophthalein , p-aminohippuric acid , taurocholic acid , triiodothyronine , dehydroepiandrosteron sulfate , testosterone  and dexamethasone  to the basolateral compartment. after 48 hours of exposure, samples for rna extraction were prepared by standard trypsin-edta treatment followed by washing with pbs. resulting cell pellets were snap-frozen and stored at -80°c until use.

rna extraction and rt-pcr analysis
total rna was prepared from cell pellets and minced pieces of tissue  via the phenol-chloroform method using trizol . concentration and quality was estimated via 260/280 nm values. representative samples were tested for rna integrity via denaturing electrophoresis. cdna was prepared using 1 μg total rna, oligo  <dig> and m-mulv reverse transcriptase according to manufacturer’s instructions. pcr was performed using 2 μl cdna sample, 2 × pcr master mix, specific primers . amplification was performed with an initial denaturation step at 92°c for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 94°c for 60 sec, 58°c for 60 sec and 72°c for 60 sec and a final extension step at 72°c for 7 min.

primer design was performed on the basis of sequence data available at ncbi  using primer <dig> v <dig>  software  <cit> , which is online available  with default settings.

pcr products were separated on  <dig> % agarose gels with 1 × tae buffer and stained with ethidium bromide. a multidoc-it digital imaging system  was used for photographic documentation.

all nucleic acid analyses were performed with appropriate control samples in parallel .

pcr products were sent to mwg, mwg-biotech ag, ebersberg, germany) for automated sequence analysis.

protein preparation and analysis
enriched membrane protein fractions were prepared according to scalera et al. with modifications  <cit> . briefly, cell pellets or minced tissue pieces were resuspended in sucrose buffer , 1 mm edta, 1 mm pmsf) using a ratio of approximately 1: <dig> . crude homogenates were prepared using a motor-driven teflon potter followed by an ultrasound step at 4°c. cellular debris was removed by centrifugation  and the supernatants were centrifuged again . the pale fractions of the pellets were combined with the supernatants and centrifuged . the resulting pellets  were resuspended in a minimal volume of sucrose buffer and total protein contents were determined using the bradford assay according to manufacturer’s instructions . samples were diluted to a final concentration of 3 mg/ml in laemmli sample buffer and incubated for 30 min at 37°c. proteins were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel  and electro-blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. after blocking , immune-detection was performed using rabbit anti-rat oat <dig> and oat <dig>  and rabbit anti-human mrp <dig> and mrp <dig>  in a dilution of 1: <dig>  and 1: <dig> , respectively, in blocking buffer overnight, washing with ttbs , followed by incubation with the secondary antibody  for 1 hr at room temperature. after additional washing, chemiluminescent detection was performed using ecl plus and hyperfilm ecl . the detection of poat <dig> and poat <dig> by specific antibodies was confirmed using the respective control blocking peptides  according to manufacturer’s instructions .

transport assays 
for transport studies, pkc were seeded  on 6-well pet filter inserts with  <dig>  μm pore size. the use of filter inserts allows measurement of transport across the blm  and the bbm  by addition of substrates to media in the lower and upper compartment, respectively. after seven days of standard culture conditions a tight cell monolayer was present and culture medium was replaced with assay medium , containing the appropriate concentration of substrate and 925 bq  of radiolabelled substrate. the cells were incubated at 37°c for the indicated times. after incubation, the media from the upper and lower chamber were saved and the filter inserts were washed carefully three times with ice-cold pbs  and cells were solubilized with  <dig>  m naoh for at least one hour at rt. thereafter, cells were acidified with 1 m hcl and an aliquot was used for protein determination using the bradford assay. 1 ml of medium from each compartment and of solubilized cells was placed into 10 ml scintillation cocktail and radioactivity was measured in a beckman ls  <dig> scintillation counter. in addition, several controls were employed  and total radioactivity  in the medium) to determine blanks, color quenching and handling variability.

transport time courses were determined using a mixture of 50 μm substrate and 925 bq radiolabelled substrate and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 30 min time points. as preliminary experiments demonstrated that no further increase of uptake could be obtained after  <dig> and 120 min incubation, these longer substrate exposure time points were omitted from further experimentation.

transport concentration dependency was determined using nominally  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 100 μm substrate, supplemented with radiolabelled substrate  and 30 min of incubation. the solutions used were measured in parallel to the experiment in order to determine the real concentrations applied resulting in  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm. inhibition studies were performed using a mixture of 50 μm substrate, 925 bq radiolabelled substrate and inhibitors  and 10 min incubation time.

for transport studies, tightness of the cellular monolayers was inspected microscopically before use. additionally, radiolabelled substrates were measured in the both chambers  to determine cell layer leakiness. in case of lacking or reduced tightness of the monolayer, very high counts  were measured in the respective opposite compartment. these resulting counts  were several-magnitudes greater than those that could have been expected from potential transepithelial transport. data from cell preparations with such apparent cell layer leakiness were omitted from calculation.

data analysis
all numerical calculations and graphical representations were performed using ms excel  <dig> and graphpad prism  <dig> . data from growth curves were calculated as means ± sd from three technical replicates. cell number doubling times were estimated from the logarithmic phase of the growth curve.

cytotoxicity data were calculated as means ± sem from at least three independent replicate experiments conducted in technical duplicates, followed by a one-way anova with a subsequent dunnett’s multiple comparison test . for the positive control , a non-linear regression  analysis was performed and effective concentrations  determined.

for kinetic data, raw transport data  were submitted to intra-assay normalization using the blanks described above and calculated using the following equation:

 meandpm×totalvolumecountedvolume×60sec×specificactivity×proteincontent×assaytime=substratepmol/mg×min 

non-linear regression  analysis was performed on data of 3- <dig> independent replicate experiments conducted in technical duplicates providing for a km and r <dig> 

densitometry was performed on agarose gels using biorad quantityone v <dig> . <dig>  each value was normalized with the respective gapdh value. to reduce residual background noise from differing absolute values of independent replicate experiments, all experiments were run with the same positive control , which were also used for intra-experimental normalization. data were presented as mean transporter expression/ housekeeping gene expression vs. positive control/ housekeeping gene expression ± sem from at least three independent replicate experiments.

RESULTS
basic characterization of pkc
pkc cultures formed monolayers with the typical epithelial appearance and domes . additionally, a basolateral-apical polarity can be assumed at confluence on the basis of the transport experiments, as described below . pkc growth patterns were investigated several times in freshly isolated cell cultures as well as for subsequent cell passages. pkc showed a typical growth curve with a lag-phase of up to 50 hours, a maximum final cell density of almost 1 ×  <dig> cells cm- <dig> at confluence and a cellular doubling time of approximately 29 hours. no differences in cell number and cellular doubling time were usually observed between cell passage zero and three , however signs of degeneration or, more likely, senescence in individual cells ) were apparent especially within cell layers of the otherwise normally looking passage three cell layer .

expression of selected transporters at mrna and protein level
gene expression analysis of transporter mrna in pkc included pmdr <dig>  pmrp <dig>  pmrp <dig>  poatp1a <dig>  poat <dig> and poat <dig>  porcine gapdh  was used as housekeeping gene and total rna from porcine renal tissue  and deionized water  served as positive and negative controls, respectively. no signal could be obtained for pmdr <dig> and poatp1a <dig> neither in the cells nor in the organ tissue preparations . all other transporter mrna was detectable in the tissue and cell samples  and the results were confirmed via sequencing of the respective rt-pcr products with 100% identity in each case. llc-pk <dig> and nrk-52e cell lines were negative for all transporters tested .

protein analyses using sds-page followed by western blotting and immunodetection with specific antibodies were performed only for transporters that were positively detected on mrna level. for this purpose, enriched membrane fractions isolated from confluent pkc, nrk-52e and llc-pk <dig> cultures and from porcine and rat renal cortex tissue were used. these experiments confirmed the mrna expression data for poat <dig> and poat <dig> in pkc, although the protein bands were different from those obtained with the renal tissue samples from rat and porcine origin . the blots show immunoreactive proteins at approximately  <dig>   <dig> and 40 kda and the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction was demonstrated by preliminary experiments using the respective control peptides  according to manufacturer’s instructions. similar but less pronounced results were obtained for poat <dig>  whereas no signals were detected for mrps in porcine tissue and cells .

expression of selected transporter mrnas with respect to time and cell density
cells from the same batch of freshly isolated cells  were seeded at different cell densities resulting in two different experimental designs. at first, poat <dig> and poat <dig> expression was tested at various levels of confluence after 7 days in culture. expression levels decreased for both transporters with decreasing cell density . then, transporter expression was investigated at the same level of confluence  in pkc after different times in culture. expression levels for both transporters decreased with culturing time .

expression of selected transporter on mrna and protein level in pkc cultures
porcine oat1/ <dig> expression was examined over several passages of pkc in culture. at the transcription level, the expression of both transporters decreased in freshly isolated cells  during culturing and was absent after passaging and re-culturing of the cells . in enriched fractions isolated from confluent pkc cultures  and from porcine renal cortex tissue poat <dig> protein was detectable via western blotting analysis  and no change in expression was observed . compared to poat <dig>  a lower protein signal was observed for poat <dig> in freshly isolated cells and in cultures of passage  <dig> and  <dig>  thereafter, poat <dig> protein was no longer detectable . no specific mrna or protein was detectable in llc-pk <dig> and nrk-52e cells.

transporter induction
to ensure that no cytotoxic side effects could influence the transporter induction experiments, basic cytotoxicity was tested using the mtt reduction assay, which is for many substances one of the most sensitive endpoints for porcine renal cells  <cit> . the sensitivity of the cells was tested using cadmium chloride as a positive control in a final concentration range of 1-500 μm resulting in a typical sigmoid concentration-response curve . moreover a time-dependent effect was observed with an ec <dig> of  <dig>  μm  and  <dig>  μm  for  <dig> and 48 hours of exposure, respectively. exposure >48 hours did not result in further increased cytotoxicity . the potential transporter inducers  did not show any cytotoxic effect after exposure of up to 96 hours, therefore it is very unlikely that they would cause cytotoxicity within the time frame of the induction experiments.

preliminary experimentation included a comparison of the standard medium  and a serum-free dmem/f <dig>  supplemented with transferrin, insulin, hydrocortisone, egf, triiodothyronine, epinephrine  and 50 μg/l pge <dig> , 5 μg/l selenious acid and antibiotics. no differences in transporter expression were observed .

no expression of either oat <dig> or oat <dig> could be induced at all conditions applied and tested via rt-pcr.

kinetics and function of organic anion transport in pkc
preliminary cytotoxicity testing using the mtt reduction assay as described above confirmed that the chosen substances  and respective concentrations are non-toxic within 24 hours of exposure . therefore it can be assumed that these substances are unlikely to cause cytotoxicity in the time frame of up to two hours within the transport experiments.

pah and mtx were chosen as model transport substrates for experimentation. whereas mtx uptake was negligible, pah uptake occurred across the basolateral  and across the brushborder membrane . kinetics of blm uptake of pah in confluent pkc was measured as a model substrate for poat <dig> and poat <dig>  uptake showed saturation kinetics  and non-linear regression analysis yielded a reasonably good fit . similarly, pah uptake across the bbm, for which the carrier has  not been identified, was also characterized by saturable uptake with good fit  .

bbm and blm uptake was found to be different in capacity and affinity, with bbm uptake being about  <dig> times higher compared to blm uptake . this is also reflected by the km values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  for uptake across bbm and blm, respectively. pah uptake was time-dependent with saturation reached within approximately 5-10 minutes .

to provide additional validation of the transporter function in pkc, inhibition of pah and uptake was assessed . mtx, ota and bsp reduced the pah bbm uptake by up to 30% , whereas cim, fa and otb showed similar inhibitory effects on the pah blm uptake . all other substances tested  were not able to inhibit pah uptake from either direction.

discussion
a good in vitro model should approximate an in vivo-like behavior as closely as possible in order to reflect most likely the in vivo situation  <cit> . regarding renal physiology of different species, humans are more closely related to pigs than to rodents  <cit> . therefore porcine renal cells could prove to be a valuable tool for renal in vitro toxicology. such a renal in vitro model should display specific characteristics  and functions  of the respective part of the kidney. this study thus aimed to provide data in order to enable an informed assessment of the suitability of primary porcine renal cells as a model for in vitro toxicological testing.

the kidney plays an important role in the elimination of harmful compounds from the body and the reabsorption of vital substances from the glomerular filtrate back into the body. both types of compounds need to be transported across the membranes of the tubular cells which is realized by specifically localized transporters especially those of the abc and slc families  <cit> . a good in vitro kidney model must therefore functionally express these transporters in the correct location. in the present study, pkcs were characterized with respect to morphological features . a basolateral-apical polarity can be assumed due to the transporting capabilities observed . this is in accordance with the data from other researchers who additionally tested similarly prepared and cultured pkcs for membrane-specific localization of pmdr <dig>  and pnbc <dig>  using confocal microscopy  <cit> . these data corroborate earlier findings in pkc, including stable cytokeratin expression patterns up to passage  <dig> and correspondingly very low but stable vimentin expression as markers of epithelial and mesenchymal cell types, respectively  <cit> . growth patterns  of pkc were found to be similar over three passages although signs of senescence  were increasing with time in culture and were apparent especially for cells of passage three. enlarged cell bodies and cytoskeletal changes are typical phenomena known for senescent cells. cellular degeneration, especially with respect to change of phenotype to a more fibroblastoid type would possibly be reversible and would include for example a change in marker protein expression. the latter was not observed with cytokeratin and vimentin in earlier studies  <cit> .

the data presented here demonstrate that pkc express various transporters at the mrna level including pmrp <dig> , pmrp <dig> , poat <dig>  and poat <dig> , whereas pmdr <dig>  and poatp1a <dig>  mrna could not be detected in either the pkcs or in the porcine cortical tissue. the latter might suggest the absence or very low abundance of these transporters in porcine kidney and pkc, a result of the detection technique employed, or a combination of both, i.e. low abundance and limited detection. results published by schlatter et al. confirm the latter interpretation as they demonstrated poatp1a <dig> mrna in their pkc, but only in freshly isolated cells and with a very faint band after a very high number of pcr cycles  <cit> . moreover, they were able to detect pmdr <dig> mrna in cultures from different cell preparations using quantitative pcr  <cit> .

to confirm the presence of various transporters in pkc detected at the mrna level oat protein expression was assessed also via western blotting analysis. due to the fact that transporters are low abundant proteins relative to total cellular protein  <cit> , it was necessary to use higher film exposure times, thereby resulting in relatively high backgrounds. these experiments however confirmed the mrna expression data for poat <dig> and poat <dig> in pkc, although the protein bands were different from those obtained with the renal tissue samples from rat and porcine origin. specific immunoreactive proteins at approximately  <dig>   <dig> and 40 kda were detected. it is suggested, that the large protein  represents the mature, fully glycosylated form. the smaller proteins, which predominate in vitro, may be deglycosylated forms of splice variants  <cit>  and/or forms that are more affected by the experimental procedure, as previously been reported for human oat <dig>  <cit> . however despite that schlatter et al. <cit>  demonstrated the expression of pmdr <dig> , pmrp <dig>  and pmrp <dig>  in pkc by immunocytochemistry using human protein derived antibodies, mrp proteins were not detectable in porcine cortical tissue and cells in the experimental set-up reported here. the latter lack of detection, which stands in contrast to the mrna data, most likely is due to the use of the mrp antibodies employed. here, polyclonal anti-human mrp1/ <dig> antibodies were used, that had been predicted to cross-react with the porcine homologues. obviously this was not the case as these transporters were not detectable in pkc as well as in porcine cortical tissue, although the general function of the antibodies was confirmed by earlier experiments using human tissue . these negative results stand also in contrast to data from other investigators showing that mrps are highly expressed in the kidney of several other species, as reviewed by klaassen and aleksunes  <cit> .

in contrast to pkc, the continuous cell lines llc-pk <dig> and nrk-52e were negative for all transporters tested at mrna and protein level. whereas other investigators described low but detectable functional expression of these transporters in nrk-52e cells  <cit> , llc-pk <dig> cells were extensively used as models for transporter over-expression by transfection due to their lack of endogenous transporter expression  <cit> . the negative results for nrk-52e cells here are most likely a result of using different strains of nrk-52e cells , but different cell culture or detection conditions might be causative as well.

transporter functionality was assessed using radiolabelled pah and mtx as model transport substrates. pah uptake occurred across the blm and bbm, but was found to be different in capacity and affinity, with bbm uptake being about  <dig> times higher compared to blm uptake. pah uptake was time-dependent with saturation reached within approximately 5-10 minutes. mtx, ota and bsp reduced the pah bbm uptake by up to 30%, whereas cim, fa and otb showed similar inhibitory effects on the basolateral pah uptake. all other substances tested did not inhibit pah uptake from either the basolateral or luminal direction.

the observed pah transport kinetics in pkcs as determined appeared typical for the expected specific transport and thus was considered, at least in part, as attributable to specific expression of poat <dig> and poat <dig>  however, due to the lack of corresponding published data for porcine cells the latter findings could not be corroborated. indeed, schlatter and co-workers who also investigated transport in pkc did not report km values or other parameters that might be suitable for comparison  <cit> . on the one hand, the calculated km values for pah uptake across bbm and blm were comparable to those observed in primary human proximal tubular cells   <cit> . the reported km values refer to single transporter proteins overexpressed in oocytes, whereas the presented km values in our study cannot be assigned to a single transporter but rather to mixed action of at least two different poats. nevertheless, based on expression data the observed uptake of pah is most likely related to poat <dig> and to a lesser extent to poat <dig>  es, a model substrate for poat <dig>  was not able to inhibit pah uptake in our study, which further suggests a predominantly poat1-mediated uptake. functional investigations of poat <dig> expressed in x. laevis oocytes resulted in a high affinity es transport with an apparent km of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm with an inhibitory effect of glutarate, dheas and probenecid  <cit> , which is similar to hoat <dig>   <cit> . in our study, probenecid did not show any inhibitory effect on pah uptake from either the basolateral or the luminal side suggesting that either an additional transporter may be involved in pah uptake which is not sensitive to probenecid or that the detected transporters poat <dig> and poat <dig> are indeed slightly different  variants when compared to their in vivo counterparts.

mtx has been shown to interact with several human transporters including hoat <dig> , hoat <dig> , hoat <dig> , hmrp <dig>  and hmrp <dig>   <cit> . cellular mtx uptake was shown to be mediated by hoat1/ <dig>  whereas hoat <dig> and hmrps seem to be involved in mtx efflux  <cit> . in human kidney cells , comparable to the pkc cells employed here, hoat1-associated mtx transport was reported across the blm with km =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and across the bbm with km =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  <cit> . based on human data, it can be assumed that mtx uptake is of high affinity/ low capacity, whereas the opposite seems to be true for mtx efflux. if the same holds true for the renal porcine transporters tested here, the results obtained with pkc could be explained by a highly efficient mtx excretion surmounting the concurrent uptake and thus resulting in the low intracellular concentrations determined. indeed, mtx has been used by others in pkc as a model substrate for mrp1- <dig> , and hypothesized to pump mtx out of the cells  <cit> . beyond the latter, mtx may also not be a substrate or a low affinity/low capacity substrate for the transporter variants expressed in pkc. due to the low intracellular concentrations determined, the question may also be raised whether the transporter variants expressed are truly functional.

mrna expression levels of poat  <dig> and poat <dig> in pkcs of passage  <dig> at different states  was examined and showed that the expression levels for both transporters decreased over time. pkcs of passage  <dig> did not show any mrna expression of poat <dig> and poat <dig> at all. this confirms earlier results from schlatter and co-workers who observed a down-regulation of poat <dig> in culture and detected poat <dig> in freshly isolated cells only  <cit> . the latter observations were also true for other transporters such as poct <dig> , which was detectable in freshly isolated cells only, pmrp <dig>  was up-regulated and pmrp <dig>  mrna expression was down-regulated in culture  <cit> . to provide a more comprehensive picture of the situation, poat1/ <dig> expression in pkc was also investigated at the protein level. in contrast to the mrna data, poat <dig> was detectable in pkc up to passage three, whereas poat <dig> was present only up to passage one and then at a much lower amount than poat <dig>  the latter observations suggest that in pkc protein stabilization and/or degradation mechanisms could be altered. this effect and the observed alterations in mrna expression further confirm the assumption of increasing senescence in the pkc cell strain.

differences in transporter function amongst individuals may be the result of an up-or down-regulation of oat expression subsequent to prior exposure to drugs and xenobiotics, or to differences in hormonal status  <cit> . in addition to the initial expression, post-translational mechanisms including glycosylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation seem to be involved in regulating the level and functionality of the expressed transporters  <cit> . while glycosylation appears to be critical in membrane targeting/ trafficking, protein folding and possibly regulation of oat function, data suggest that phosphorylation and interactions of the oats with protein partners may change oat function  <cit> . indeed t <dig>  dheas, test and dex were proposed by several authors  <cit>  as potential inducers of transporter expression. accordingly pkc were treated with t <dig>  dheas, test, bsp, pah, tca and dex and tested whether this would result in a more stable expression of transporters. however, none of the tested substances showed any stimulatory effect on transporter mrna expression in the tested concentration and time frame. whether this is due to species differences or to the lacking tissue structure compared to renal slices or tubules used in other studies  <cit>  remains to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
a porcine renal in vitro model would be cheap, easy to establish, to handle and readily available. the pkc tested here were characterized comprehensively with respect to general features and transport functions. on the basis of the results obtained and the comparison of parts of the data with previously published information, it can be concluded that primary pkc, but not necessarily the resulting pkc cell strain, could represent a valuable model for in vitro toxicology that possibly could be used as an alternative to human primary cells, provided a more in-depth characterization of transport and xenobiotic metabolism and toxicity is carried out. furthermore and pending more in-depth understanding of the expression and functionality of transporters, primary pkc can be used to study toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of substances as well as tubular toxicity requiring specific transport mechanisms.
