BACKGROUND
improving grain quality and grain yield are among the most important objectives in rice breeding programs. apparent amylose content  is known to affect the eating and cooking quality  of rice  <cit> . however, the rapid viscosity analyser  profile can distinguish eating quality rice varieties with similar aacs by evaluating the breakdown , setback , and consistency  viscosities  <cit> . in general, rice varieties with good eating quality have a bd of more than  <dig> rapid visco units  and an sb of less than  <dig> rvu  <cit> . therefore, starch paste viscosities play an essential role in estimating the eating, cooking, and processing qualities of rice, and have received more and more attention in rice breeding programs  <cit> .

the wx gene encodes granule bound starch synthase i , which is responsible for amylose synthesis. starch paste viscosity properties are predominantly controlled by the wx gene, as well as minor-effect genes with various additive effects . the starch paste viscosity of glutinous rice differs from that of non-glutinous rice due to its lack of amylose  <cit> . since gbssi is inactive in glutinous varieties, the starch paste properties are thought to be controlled by other genes. the pullulanase  gene plays an important role in the control of peak viscosity , hot paste viscosity , cold paste viscosity , bd, peak time , and pasting temperature  in glutinous rice  <cit> . soluble starch synthase iia  is responsible for hpv, cpv, bd, sb, pet, and ptemp, as well as the thermal properties of glutinous rice  <cit> . polymorphisms in both sbe <dig> and sbe <dig> loci account for 70 % of the observed variations in hpv and cpv, and account for 40 % in both pv and cs in waxy rice  <cit> . many populations derived from bi-parental crosses with similar aacs were developed to identify qtls for starch paste viscosities and eliminate the wx effects in non-glutinous accessions  <cit> . a qtl cluster close to ssiia that had major effects on the alkali spreading value , pasting time, and minor effects on gel consistency, aac, pv, cpv, bd, and sb was identified  <cit> . the branching enzyme iib  gene cluster is responsible for pv, hpv, cpv, bd, cs, and gel consistency  <cit>  . another method to avoid the effects of the wx gene on starch paste viscosity was performed to detect more qtls within sub-populations of the same wx background  <cit> .

association mapping is a powerful method to connect structural genomics and phenomics in plants, provided that information on population structure and linkage disequilibrium  are available  <cit> . association mapping, especially candidate-gene association mapping, is commonly used to detect qtls for starch qualities  <cit> . tian et al.  <cit>  found that the starch synthesis-related genes  cooperated with each other to form a regulatory network that controls the ecqs and defines correlations among aac, asv, and gel consistency. yan et al.  <cit>  genotyped waxy rice with  <dig> ssrgs using  <dig> gene-tagged molecular markers, and found that  <dig> ssrgs are involved in controlling the rva profile parameters. however, candidate-gene association mapping will miss other unknown loci, and genome-wide association studies  are comprehensive approaches to systemically search the genome for causal genetic variations  <cit> . the distribution of functional alleles is strongly correlated with population structure since ld can be caused by an admixture of subpopulations, which leads to false-positive results, particularly in populations with a small number of samples  <cit> . an ideal sample with a subtle population structure and familial relatedness is the best panel to control for false-negatives  <cit> . moreover, subdividing the diversity panel to analyze subpopulations independently using the mixed model provides a reasonable solution to lower false-positive or -negative rates  <cit> . for example, huang et al.  <cit>  chose only the indica landrace population to conduct gwas for  <dig> agronomic traits. huang et al.  <cit>  collected phenotypic data of flowering time and grain-related traits for a gwas on the indica or japonica subpopulations and the whole population, respectively.

two subspecies of rice , indica and japonica, differ in several morphological and physiological characteristics including grain shape, shattering, apiculus hair length, leaf color, seed dormancy, cold tolerance, phenol, and sensitivity to potassium chlorate . moreover, japonica and indica rice varieties vary in starch physicochemical properties, which strongly influences rice cooking and processing methods for food and industrial applications  <cit> . the wxa allele is predominant in non-waxy indica cultivars with high aacs , whereas the wxb allele, with low aacs , is common to the non-waxy japonica variety . the splice donor mutation is prevalent in temperate japonica rice but rare or absent in indica and tropical japonica rice  <cit> . the indica type ssiia can convert s-type amylopectin to l-type amylopectin by elongating short chains of dp  ≤ <dig> to form chains of dp 13– <dig>  <cit> . the japonica s-type amylopectin has enriched short branch chains of dp ≤ <dig> and depleted intermediate chains of 12 ≤dp ≤ <dig> compared with the indica l-type amylopectin, whereas the proportion of cluster interconnecting long chains of dp ≥ <dig> are comparable in the two varieties  <cit> . bao et al.  <cit>  classified  <dig> glutinous rice varieties into two groups according to the gelatinization temperature , corresponding to high gt and low gt, and found that all  <dig> high gt accessions belonged to indica rice. despite the two genes  being well-studied, the exact genetic effects of other ssrgs in shaping grain quality and starch paste viscosities in different rice subpopulations remain unclear  <cit> .

in the present study, we divided the  <dig> non-glutinous rice accessions into two panels and two ecotype based panels, and explored the genetics of  <dig> ecq parameters in different panels and ecotypes based on genome-wide association mapping with high-quality re-sequencing data. these results will increase our understanding of the mechanism of ecq properties in different ecotypes and how minor-effect qtls function on ecqs.

RESULTS
phenotypic variation and contribution of population structure to phenotypic variation
population structure was evaluated using the admixture program, which estimates individual ancestry and admixture proportions assuming that k populations exist based on a maximum-likelihood method  <cit> . because rice  has two subspecies, it was not surprising that indica and japonica subpopulations could be identified. however, the indica subpopulation could be further divided into indica, aus, as well as some admixtures , while the japonica subpopulation could be divided into temperate japonica, tropical japonica, and some admixtures . principal component analysis  plots of the first two components  clearly differentiated rice accessions into different subpopulations, which corresponded with the population structure results . all  <dig> phenotypic variations in the admixture group showed moderate levels. the aus group had the highest aac, pet, sb, and cs, but the lowest pv, hpv, cpv, bd, and ptemp. the indica group had a wide phenotypic variation range with regards to aac, pv, hpv, cpv, bd, sb, and cs compared to the other groups, and its aac, pv, cpv, sb, and cs mid-values were higher than those of the japonica group. temperate japonica had the lowest aac, sb, cs, and pet, and the highest ptemp. the phenotypic variation of tropical japonica was between that of indica and temperate japonica. however, there was no significant difference in protein content  among groups .fig.  <dig> principal component analysis  in  <dig> panels

with respect to the whole panel, a wide range in all traits was observed for aac , pro , pv , hpv , cpv , bd , sb , cs , pet , and ptemp  . when comparing the indica panel with the japonica panel, the aac, cpv, sb, cs, and ptemp of the indica panel were significantly higher than those of the japonica panel. the pro, hpv, and pet of the indica panel were significantly lower than those of the japonica panel, whereas pv and bd were similar between the two panels . furthermore, the aac, pro, sb, cs, and ptemp of panel  <dig> were significantly higher than those of panel  <dig>  panel  <dig> had lower pv, hpv, bd, and pet than panel  <dig> .table  <dig> phenotypic variation in different panels and ecotype  contribution to phenotypic variation

in the whole panel, population structure explained  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>  %  of phenotypic variation  . however, population structure affected only two traits in the indica panel  and two traits in the japonica panel  at the significance level of p < <dig> , and affected  <dig> traits  in indica panel and  <dig> traits  in japonica panel at significance level of p < <dig>  . in panel  <dig>  except for bd, population structure accounted for large phenotypic variation explanation , ranging from  <dig>  %  to  <dig>  %  at a significance level of p < <dig> . in panel  <dig>  population structure explained  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>  %  phenotypic variation  .

discussion
effect of population structure on gwas
given that linkage disequilibrium can be caused by the admixture of subpopulations and may result in false-positives if not correctly controlled in the statistical analysis, estimation of population structure must be included in the association analysis  <cit> . in this study, to determine whether different networks of alleles were associated with ecq trait variation in the different panels, we performed gwas on each of the four panels independently and in the panel as a whole. the present study allowed us to compare gwas results derived from different panels.

the effect of population structure on phenotypic variation was estimated based on analysis of variance  . for the whole panel, eight of  <dig> traits were strongly affected by population structure. for panel  <dig> and  <dig>  nine and five traits were strongly affected by population structure , respectively, indicating that panel  <dig>  experienced artificial selection, which was less structured than panel  <dig>  however, only two traits were significantly affected by population structure in the indica and japonica panels at significance level of p < <dig> , suggesting that association mapping in the subpopulations, e.g. indica or japonica subpopulations, with simple population structures can lower false-positives. indica and japonica varietal groups should be properly treated for association analysis, which may explain why transgressive offspring occur in divergent subpopulation crosses  <cit>  .

qtl comparison among different panels
for convenience, we regarded those snps that were detected in different panels with the physical distance less than  <dig>  mb as the same qtl, and these snps were regarded as alleles.

similar to previous studies, the wx gene is responsible for aac in these five panels. the single nucleotide polymorphism   for aac is the wxa/wxb allele , which was present in the whole panel, panel  <dig>  and japonica panel. the wx gene was also the major qtl for aac in the other two panels, but the wxa/wxb allele was not the most significant association site, suggested that different traits maybe preferred linked with different snps. besides the wx gene, one minor effect locus  for aac was detected in panel  <dig> ; this locus was close to the qtl flanked by bph and rm <dig>  <cit>  .

one qtl  for pro detected in the whole panel and panel  <dig> was close to the protein content qtl qpro <dig>  which was detected by xu et al.  <cit>  in the m201-wx subpopulation. the other qtl  for pro detected in the whole, panel  <dig>  indica, and japonica panels was close to pro <dig>  which is flanked by rm <dig> and rm <dig>  <cit> .

for starch paste viscosity parameters, a specific snp , recognized as the wxa/wxb allele, was responsible for  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  in the whole panel, panel  <dig>  and japonica panel, respectively. there were also some snps close to wx gene that significantly associated with rva parameters. however, only one wx gene linked snp was detected for bd in panel  <dig>  that may due to the reason that most korean breeding lines were low-aac varieties with less diversity. the gwas results in our study may increase our understanding of the genetic control of starch properties in south korea japonica rice varieties with low aacs and the same wx allele. besides the wx gene,  <dig> qtls were identified in two panels,  <dig> qtls were detected in  <dig> panels, and  <dig> qtls were detected in  <dig> panels . the qtl  was detected for pv in the whole panel and panel  <dig>  for hpv in the whole panel, panel  <dig> and japonica panel, and for pet in the whole panel and japonica panel. this locus has not been detected in previous studies, and is a potentially novel locus specifically present in japonica rice varieties. the qtl  for hpv in the whole panel, indica, and japonica panels, and for cpv in the whole panel and japonica panel, was close to qpv <dig> for pv, hpv, and cpv  <cit> , which is close to the isoamylase  <dig> gene . the qtl  for bd in the whole panel and japonica panel and sb in the whole panel, was close to qsb <dig>  <cit> . the qtl  for bd and sb in the whole panel and indica panel was close to the qtl  for pv, hpv, cpv, and sb  <cit> , and close to the qtl for sb and cs  <cit> . the qtl  for sb, detected in the whole panel and panel  <dig>  was close to the qtl for fv , pkt, sbv, and tv , and is linked with rm <dig>  <cit> . the qtl  for cs in the whole panel, panel  <dig>  and japonica panel, and three loci for sb , pet , and cpv  was  <dig>  mb from the ssiv- <dig> gene , indicating that ssiv- <dig> may influence starch qualities through affecting cpv, sb, cs, and pet. the qtl  for cs in the whole panel and panel  <dig>  and for cpv in panel  <dig>  was close to qcs <dig> described by yan et al.  <cit> . the qtl  for pet was detected in panel  <dig> and the japonica panel, and was close to btemp  flanked by rm <dig> and rm <dig>  <cit> . the qtl  for ptemp, detected in the whole panel, panel  <dig>  indica, and japonica panels, was close to the alk gene   <cit> , which encodes starch synthase iia .

qtls detected in specific panels
panel 1
the locus  for hpv, detected only in the panel  <dig>  was about  <dig>  mb away from the adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase large subunit  <dig>  gene . the locus  for pv and cpv was about  <dig>  mb from the starch synthase ii- <dig>  gene . the locus  for cs was close to qsb11b . the locus  for cpv was close to the qtl for pv and fv, which is linked with rm <dig>  <cit> .

panel 2
the qtl  for pv, hpv, and cpv was close to qhpv <dig> and qcpv <dig>  which are linked with rm <dig>  <cit> . the locus  for hpv and cpv, and locus  for pv were close to the qtl for fa  and hpv, which are linked with rm <dig>  <cit> . the locus  for bd was close to qbd <dig>  <cit> . the locus  for pet was close to the qbtemp <dig> for peak temperature  <cit> .

indica panel
the locus  for hpv was close to the qhpv <dig>   <cit> .

japonica panel
the locus  for pro was close to the qpc- <dig>  <cit> . the locus  for pv was close to the qpv <dig>  <cit>  and qpkv <dig>  <cit> . the qtl  for pet was close to the qpet <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
overall, we investigated the genetics of  <dig> rice ecq parameters by gwas mapping in the whole panel and four derived panels. gwas within subspecies panels  cannot only lower false-positives influenced by population structure, but can also increase our understanding of ecq differences between indica and japonica subspecies. comparison of gwas results indicated that some loci were common in different panels, while some were in specific panels. loci detected in more than one panel were potentially reliable qtls for ecqs, and these qtls should be properly used in molecular breeding to improve rice ecqs, particularly in the korean japonica rice with similar aacs and the same wx allele.
