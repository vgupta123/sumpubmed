BACKGROUND
a hallmark of spermiogenesis is the transformation of the chromatin of the germ cell. in elongating spermatids nucleosomes are replaced by transition proteins, which are subsequently replaced by protamines. the protamine-based chromatin allows a dense packing of the dna, which facilitates its protection and transportation to the oocyte . the replacement of nucleosomes by protamines is frequently observed throughout the animal kingdom  <cit> , though the degree of this chromatin substitution varies among species. protamination in mouse and boar is almost complete and only an estimated 1% of the total dna in mouse sperm cells remains nucleosome bound, whereas in human sperm this is estimated to be about 15%  <cit> . characterisation of the histones in human sperm identified h2a, h2ax, h2az, h2b, h <dig> , h <dig> , cenh <dig> and h <dig>  <cit> .

analysis of the preferential chromatin conformation  of several genes and structural elements in human sperm showed limited differences between sperm of one individual, but also between sperm of different individuals  <cit> . this sequence-specific chromatin conformation has been suggested to facilitate transcriptional activation of paternal genes in early embryogenesis and enable the three-dimensional organization of the sperm nucleus  <cit> . however, whether sperm- derived nucleosomes contribute to zygotic chromatin, a necessity to enable such epigenetic programs, or are removed during the extensive chromatin remodelling occurring after gamete fusion  <cit>  has hitherto not been established. roles for the maintenance of imprinting, as speculated by  <cit>  has recently been illustrated in arabidopsis, where, contrary to the zygote proper, a specific paternal h <dig>  isoform was maintained in the endosperm, the plant tissue where imprinting pays a role  <cit> 

therefore, we set out to detect histones of sperm origin in paternal zygotic chromatin. since deposition of maternally derived histones takes place immediately after gamete fusion  <cit> , sperm-derived histones, if retained, become indistinguishable from maternal ones. to circumvent this problem we used the difference in deposition characteristics of the histone h <dig> variants. the histones h <dig> /h <dig>   are assembled into nucleosomes when dna replication occurs, in contrast to histone h <dig> , which is only incorporated outside the context of dna replication  <cit> . hence, shedding of protamines after sperm entry is followed by deposition of the h <dig>  – h <dig> dimer chaperoned by hira  <cit> . deposition of maternal h <dig> /h <dig>  starts at the onset of zygotic s-phase, which commences approximately  <dig> hours after insemination in human zygotes  <cit> . therefore, all h <dig> /h <dig>  present in the paternal chromatin prior to s-phase must originate from the male germ line.

methods
sperm decondensation in vitro
sperm head decondensation was achieved by incubation of sperm samples in pbs containing  <dig> % triton x- <dig>   <dig> iu heparin  and  <dig>  mm dtt at room temperature  <cit> . in order to obtain more than 80% decondensed heads per sample, incubation time varied between  <dig> to  <dig> minutes. the decondensation process was stopped by immersing the glass slides in 4% paraformaldehyde  for  <dig> minutes. slides were then washed twice in pbs and allowed to dry.

preparation of cryo-preserved human sperm for heterologous icsi
cryo-straws containing  <dig> μl sperm suspension were thawed at room temperature and  <dig> μl htf-hepes was added and gently mixed. the content was transferred to an eppendorf vial and centrifuged for  <dig> minutes at  <dig> xg. subsequently the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was gently dissolved in htf-hepes and kept at room temperature.

preparation of mouse oocytes for heterologous icsi
b6d <dig> f <dig> females  were used as oocyte donors and were kept in an adjusted light schedule, set at  <dig>  am –  <dig>  pm. superovulation was induced by i.p. injection of  <dig>  iu pregnant mare's serum gonadotrophin  around  <dig> pm, followed by  <dig>  iu hcg  after  <dig> h. oocytes were harvested from the oviducts  <dig> h after administration of hcg and stored without cumulus cells at 37°c for up to  <dig> h in complemented mem-α  <cit> .

heterologous intra cytoplasmic sperm injection
microinjection was performed as described in  <cit>  and  <cit>  with some adaptations. the temperature in the injection droplet was kept at 24°c. for each icsi experiment cryo-preserved sperm samples were freshly prepared . each injection round a sperm aliquot was transferred to medium containing 12% polyvinyl pyrrolidone. sperm were selected for normal morphology and motility. after injection, oocytes were kept on the injection platform for  <dig> minutes, then gradually warmed to 37°c and placed in culture medium at 37°c, 5% co <dig> in air  <cit> .

immobilization, fixation and immunofluorescence staining of mouse zygotes
prior to fixation of the zygotes the zona pellucida was removed with acidic tyrode  containing 1% bsa. thereafter, cells were immobilised in a fibrin clot  <cit> . fibrinogen was obtained from calbiochem, cat. nr. 341573; thrombin was obtained from sigma, cat. nr. t- <dig>  cells were fixed in 2% pfa,  <dig> % triton x- <dig> for  <dig> minutes, followed by incubation in ice-cold methanol for  <dig> minutes. immunofluorescence was performed as described previously  <cit> .

antibodies
the monoclonal antibody # <dig> was used at a dilution of 1: <dig> to detect h <dig> /h <dig>  . additional proof of antibody specificity was obtained by probing nuclear extracts of tagged h <dig> isoform transgenic mice on western blots with ab # <dig>  <cit> . polyclonal rabbit pan-h <dig>  was used at a dilution of 1: <dig>  to unmask the epitope for the pan-h <dig> antibody slides were first incubated in  <dig> m hcl for  <dig> minutes prior to blocking, after which slides were extensively washed in pbs. primary antibodies were detected by molecular probes a <dig> fluor  <dig> goat anti-mouse igg  and a <dig> fluor  <dig> goat anti-rabbit igg . both were used in a 1: <dig> dilution.

collection and fixation of human polypronuclear zygotes
polypronuclear zygotes, i.e. zygotes that show three or more pronuclei after insemination instead of the expected two, are considered to be non-diploid and are therefore never transferred to the uterus in a human ivf setting. polypronuclear zygotes used in this study were obtained from couples undergoing routine ivf procedures at the erasmus mc in the period between june and september  <dig>  this study was approved by the dutch central committee on research involving human subjects  and the local ethics review committee of the erasmus university medical center. human zygotes were produced by conventional in vitro fertilization  or after intracytoplasmic sperm injection   <cit> . after ivf, remaining cumulus cells and sperm cells were removed from the oocytes by gentle aspiration ~ <dig> hrs after insemination and oocytes were moved to fresh drops of culture medium. all oocytes after both ivf and icsi were checked hourly until  <dig> hrs past insemination for the appearance of pronuclei. to ensure that zygotes were fixed before the onset of s-phase, they were collected as soon as more then two clearly discernible pronuclei were observed. before fixation, zona pellucida were removed from zygotes by pronase treatment . immobilization and fixation occurred as described above. after washing in pbs, fixed zygotes were either stored at 4°c in pbs containing 10% normal goat serum and  <dig> % nan <dig> or frozen in culture medium containing  <dig>  m dmso.

RESULTS
presence of histone h <dig> in human sperm
both the replacement and replication variants are detected in sperm by hplc analysis  <cit> . to visualize histone h <dig> in sperm by immunofluorescence, we decondensed the cells by incubation in a mixture containing heparin and dtt. the dense structure of sperm chromatin does not allow antibody penetration without this treatment. staining of decondensed sperm with the pan-h <dig> and h <dig> /h <dig>  antibodies showed a relatively homogeneous structure revealing signal for both .

localisation of replication h <dig> variants in human paternal chromatin after heterologous icsi
to find out whether human sperm derived histones are retained in paternal chromatin after decondensation, we determined the presence of h <dig> replication variants in paternal chromatin in zygotic g <dig>  this signal will not be obscured by de novo nucleosome assembly from the oocyte. sperm from three fertile donors was used for injection in mouse oocytes. after injection, zygotes were incubated for different periods of time  prior to fixation to allow detection of h <dig> /h <dig>  at various stages of g <dig>  <cit> . at all stages we observed a prominent h <dig> /h <dig>  staining of maternal chromatin and a minor but clear staining of the paternal chromatin . localisation of h <dig> /h <dig>  was found throughout the male chromatin, not concentrated in specific regions, again revealing a certain structure. due to the increase of paternal pronuclear size at g <dig> in time, signals became diluted later on. the visualized h <dig> /h <dig>  fraction in paternal chromatin  is an underrepresentation of the total amount of h <dig> transmitted by the male gamete since the h <dig> replacement variant  is also present in sperm  <cit>  .

localisation of replication h <dig> variants in paternal chromatin in human polypronuclear zygotes
to determine whether the h <dig> replication variants are also present in zygotic paternal human chromatin in a homologous setting, we localised h <dig> /h <dig>  in abnormally fertilized human oocytes, produced by ivf. from seven hours after insemination, appearance of the pronuclei was visually assessed every hour. zygotes in which  <dig> or more pronuclei were observed were collected and fixed. histone h <dig> /h <dig>  staining revealed a localisation reminiscent to that of the heterologous zygotes. maternal chromatin clearly contained histone h <dig> /h <dig> , whereas the sperm-derived chromatin according to expectation exhibited a less intense staining . zygotes after s-phase had a clear increase in pronuclear histone h <dig> /h <dig>  levels, confirming the replication kinetics of these h <dig> species .

discussion
the relative abundance of nucleosomal chromatin and the presence of modified histones in human sperm  <cit>  potentially allows a protein-based epigenetic program  <cit> . it has been suggested that genes that are contained in nucleosomal chromatin undergo earlier transcriptional activation as opposed to genes in protamine-based chromatin  <cit> . this implies a function for the dual nucleosome/protamine chromatin structure in regulation of gene expression in the early embryo  <cit> . furthermore, it has also been hypothesized that the cue which triggers inactivation of the paternally derived x chromosome  after gamete fusion is contained in the transmitted nucleosomal chromatin of the xp  <cit> . a requirement for such paternal-derived epigenetic program to operate in the zygote is that sperm derived nucleosomes must be retained in paternal chromatin. after gamete fusion, sperm chromatin is subjected to intense remodelling and the protamines but possibly also the nucleosomes are removed from the dna. previously, we have shown that in mouse, modified nucleosomes present in sperm are transmitted to the zygote  <cit> . here, we demonstrate that in human sperm, the h <dig> replication variants contribute to paternal chromatin in the zygote . since histone h <dig> forms the nucleosome complex with the other histone proteins, it is conceivable that also these other histones are retained in the paternal chromatin in the zygote. recent work showed that under in vitro conditions h <dig> / <dig>  containing nucleosomes are much more stable than h <dig>  containing nucleosomes  <cit> . this difference might explain in part the association of h <dig>  with actively transcribed genes and h <dig> /h <dig>  with silent regions  <cit> . paternal sequences wrapped around h <dig> /h <dig>  containing nucleosomes could be poised to transcriptional inactivity and initiate self-propagation of this state at the service of structural chromosomal elements like centric heterochromatin ; arabidopsis zygote and endosperm nuclei  <cit> ). however, also sperm derived h <dig> -containing nucleosomes are likely to contribute to the paternal chromatin. a recent study with transplantation experiments in xenopus embryos suggested that histone h <dig>  has a role in the memory of transcription states, also in the absence of actual gene transcription  <cit> .

an estimated 15% of the genome in human sperm remains in a nucleosomal context  <cit> . the epigenetic potential by incorporation of these sperm derived nucleosomes into the paternal zygotic chromatin is obvious  <cit> . future research, however, is needed to establish whether such programs exist.

the treatment of infertility via artificial reproduction enables men with hampered spermatogenesis to sire offspring. recent studies have indicated a decrease in the protamine/nucleosome ratio when comparing sperm from infertile men to fertile men  <cit> . also the kinetics of paternal cpg demethylation could be affected by the presence of nucleosomes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the use of a h <dig> /h <dig>  specific antibody enabled demonstration of paternal histones in pre-s-phase pronuclear human zygotes and zygotes produced by human sperm and mouse oocytes. this could have consequences for early developmental processes via enabling downstream effects of sperm derived nucleosomal chromatin that contains variants and/or carries histone modifications. a higher nucleosomal content in sperm as is now found in human oligospermia would then lead to expanded epigenetic transmission.
