BACKGROUND
the gram-negative bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae uses a type iii secretion system  to translocate type iii effector  proteins into the cytoplasm of plant cells. the primary function of these t3ses is believed to be the suppression of plant immunity  <cit> . some plant hosts are able to respond to this challenge via effector-triggered immunity , a defense response that is elicited when a plant resistance  protein recognizes a specific effector protein either through direct interaction, or indirectly via the action of the t3se on its host targets  <cit> . the pathogen may respond by acquiring a new effector protein to suppress this recognition or by diversifying away from recognition  <cit> . thus, the pathogen and host each endeavor to gain the upper hand, resulting in a co-evolutionary arms race.

there are ~ <dig> t3se families identified in p. syringae, yet a majority of these remain functionally uncharacterized. a key to ascribing functions to these virulence proteins will be the identification of their host target proteins. in addition, since many t3ses have evolved to suppress plant immunity, they can be used as probes to identify important components of resistance signaling pathways.

the hopz family of t3se proteins is an evolutionary diverse family that is part of the yopj t3se superfamily found in animal and plant pathogens  <cit> . the hopz family of p. syringae is composed of three distinct allele families , while hopz <dig> also has three closely-related allele sub-families . hopz1a is most similar to the ancestral hopz allele and is recognized by the zar <dig> resistance protein in arabidopsis  <cit> . although closely related to hopz1a, hopz1b is only weakly recognized, and hopz1c is not recognized in arabidopsis  <cit> . hopz <dig> and hopz <dig> are more similar to yopj superfamily members found in other phytopathogens and were likely acquired by p. syringae via horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . both hopz <dig> and hopz <dig> have been demonstrated to enhance p. syringae growth on arabidopsis  <cit> . overall, the hopz family displays remarkable functional diversification in arabidopsis with members able to enhance bacterial virulence while others trigger eti. therefore, the targets of this t3se family will likely include critical components of host immunity.

the yeast two-hybrid  system is a powerful tool to query protein-protein interactions  <cit> . although several modifications of this method have been developed, they all involve using a bait protein of interest to identify interacting prey proteins. in general, this can be done by using a bait to systematically test specific prey clones, or alternatively using a bait to identify interacting proteins from a pooled library of prey clones. the former method has been applied extensively in high-throughput fashion to generate high quality protein-protein interactome maps  <cit> ; nevertheless, the coverage of these interactome maps is relatively low and is typically limited to model organisms, which have high quality libraries of cloned open reading frames . if an orf library is not available, a widely used alternative is to screen a cdna library; however, this approach carries the ascertainment and representation biases associated with all cdna library methods. additionally, screening of these biased libraries is typically limited by the throughput that candidate interactors can be sequenced.

recently, vidal and colleagues have established a framework to generate and assess high-throughput y2h screens and established the first protocol for next-generation sequencing of protein-protein interactomes  <cit> . their stitch-seq method employs pcr to concatenate the sequences of putatively interacting bait and prey proteins so that they comprise a single amplicon for downstream next-generation sequencing  <cit> . pcr stitching is done via common priming sites located downstream of both the bait and prey sequences. their protocol was specifically designed for y2h assays using gateway sequences and clones, but can be generalized to other vectors and a wide variety of interaction assays. while unquestionably promising, there are some potential limitations to this approach. the first relates to the size of the stitch-seq concatenated amplicon, which is substantially larger than read lengths produced by current next-generation genome sequencers. as the authors note, in principle this obstacle can be overcome as read lengths improve or through paired-end sequencing, but the short reads generated by many next-gen sequencers may prove difficult to associate with a specific gene when working with random cdna libraries generated from organisms with limited genomic resources. another potential limitation arises from the long lengths of the stitched pcr products, which encompass the bait orf, a linker, and the prey orf, and the need for two rounds of pcr, which may result in pcr biases that influence the recovery of candidate interactors.

here we describe quantitative interaction screen sequencing , which couples split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid screening with illumina next-generation sequencing to rapidly identify interacting partners of a bait of interest. we employed this high-throughput and quantitative interactor screen to identify host targets of the hopz family of t3se proteins, and then demonstrate that these targets include components of plant innate immunity in plants. all members of the hopz t3se family  are membrane-associated  <cit> , and as such, we used the split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid screen that utilizes a membrane-associated bait protein  <cit>  in order to enrich for physiologically relevant interactors. we used this approach to identify mlo <dig> as an interactor of hopz <dig>  and confirmed this interaction in vivo by bimolecular fluorescence microscopy . mlo <dig> has a characterized role in powdery mildew resistance, but had not previously been shown to contribute to p. syringae growth. we demonstrate that mlo <dig> contributes to resistance against p. syringae in arabidopsis and is required for hopz <dig> virulence function.

RESULTS
evaluation of the cdna prey library
our cdna prey library was commercially made  from rna extracted from uninfected 4- <dig> week old arabidopsis rosettes, as well as plants infiltrated with a virulent pathogen , a non-virulent strain lacking the t3ss apparatus , and an avirulent strain translocating a t3se recognized by an arabidopsis r protein . although it is common to amplify primary cdna libraries after their initial construction, this step can potentially introduce representation biases that may influence the interactor screen. we amplified the primary library by semi-solid amplification as this method is believed to reduce overall amplification bias  <cit> . we first sequenced the primary and secondary cdna prey libraries to assess representation and bias arising from the initial library construction and subsequent amplification. amplified dna was sequenced on an illumina ga-iix using standard protocols at the university of toronto centre for the analysis of genome evolution and function . sequencing of the primary- and amplified libraries yielded  <dig>  m and  <dig>  m reads respectively, which read-mapped to ~ <dig> k arabidopsis genes . the cdnas ranged from ~ <dig> nt up to ~ <dig>  nt, with most not being full length since they were generated by random hexamer priming . a scatterplot of the hits/locus for the two libraries revealed very high congruence , indicating that very little bias was introduced during the amplification process.

to further evaluate the range of genes represented in the library, we analyzed the gene ontology  annotations of the cdnas recovered . many biological processes were represented including metabolism, response to stress or stimulus, development, transport and signal transduction, although unknown was the most common . the subcellular localization of many of the cdnas was also unknown; however, loci were identified in virtually every cellular compartment including 13% associated with membranes. genes with known molecular functions included those involved in protein binding, hydrolase activity, nucleic acid metabolism, transcription factors, transporters, and kinases. we further examined publicly available microarray data available through the cagef bio-array resource  to determine whether loci represented in our library were differentially regulated in responses to biotic stress from bacteria , oomycetes , or elicitors of innate immunity . 38% of genes were upregulated more than 2-fold in response to biotic stress while 46% did not respond to biotic stress . a further 16% did not have probe sets to detect transcriptional changes arising from biotic stress. none of our library loci were downregulated in response to biotic stress.

quantitative interaction screen sequencing 
since most members of the hopz family of t3se proteins are membrane-associated by myristoylation  <cit> , we adapted the split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system that was developed for transmembrane bait proteins   <cit> . based on membrane-association studies of k-ras, we constructed a bait vector with a c-terminal prenylation signal and polybasic sequence in order to stably associate the protein with membranes   <cit> .

we screened the arabidopsis prey library by cloning catalytic mutants of all five of the hopz alleles, as well as the arabidopsis r protein zar <dig> that recognizes hopz1a into our membrane-tethered bait vector . we used the catalytic mutants of the hopz t3ses in order to prevent processing of putative substrates and potentially stabilize transient interactions that would occur with the active enzyme. this method has been termed inactive catalytic domain capture  and has proven successful for stabilizing enzyme-substrate interactions  <cit> . we also screened the prey library with hopf2pto, which is a p. syringae t3se that is unrelated, both with respect to function and sequence, to the hopz family, as well as luciferase as a non-specific protein control since it should not specifically interact with any arabidopsis proteins. we transformed our baits of interest by lithium acetate/peg transformation and screened them on plates with dropout media lacking histidine, one of the interaction reporter genes. approximately  <dig> colonies of each bait were collected and then restreaked twice on dropout media lacking tryptophan in order to preferentially retain the prey plasmid and lose the bait plasmid thereby reducing the complexity of the plasmid pool for next-generation sequencing  <cit> . the colonies were harvested en masse, digested with lyticase, and then plasmids were purified using alkaline lysis. finally, the prey-plasmid inserts were amplified with vector-specific primers using low-cycle pcr to reduce amplification bias and the pcr product was illumina sequenced. each bait provided  <dig>  m to  <dig>  m quality reads  which were read-mapped to the arabidopsis reference using novoalign , which performs base-quality aware, global alignments with affine gap penalties using full implementation of the needleman-wunsch algorithm. the number of reads per arabidopsis coding sequence were converted to reads per million in order to normalize across samples.

we then assessed for overall enrichment of each candidate interactor by scaling the number of hits observed between our bait of interest and each candidate interactor relative to the frequency of those candidates in the primary library. the candidates' general 'stickiness' was also assessed by the number of times it was recovered using luciferase, our non-specific bait protein. specifically, enrichment was calculated as / * <dig>  where each term is scaled as the number of mapped-reads per million . this enrichment measure scales from  <dig> to  <dig> with higher values corresponding to those candidate interactors that do not bind luciferase  and are rare in the library .

functional analysis of hopz2-interactors
we elected to focus our initial functional study on hopz <dig> because it can promote p. syringae growth in arabidopsis and also since a preliminary analysis of the data provided the most interesting candidate interactors. our enrichment analysis of hopz2c229a  interactors identified several highly overrepresented and specific candidate interactors . hopz2c/a interactors were enriched for membrane-associated proteins  as well as proteins associated with responses to stress relative to the prey library . based on our sequencing of the cdna prey library, we could also assess the percent cdna coverage of each hopz2c/a interactor in the prey library. for functional analyses we focused on the hopz2c/a interactors that had:  an enrichment value > 90% ,  were represented by clones >  <dig> amino acids in the cdna prey library   and  were specific to hopz2c/a  . we hypothesized that these genes would include hopz <dig> virulence targets and that their disruption would alter p. syringae growth.

*tested for increased or decreased bacterial growth

we measured p. syringae growth in arabidopsis lines carrying t-dna insertions for each hopz2c/a specific interactor to determine if the candidate hopz <dig> interacting proteins played any role in p. syringae disease or resistance. we focused on interactors for which there were confirmed homozygous t-dna insertion lines available and that were predicted to have the t-dna insertion in an exon of the gene, and thus be more likely to interrupt the protein . we assayed for changes in immunity by infiltrating the t-dna insertion lines with the virulent pathogen ptodc <dig> and evaluating bacterial growth after three days. insertions in genes at4g <dig>  at5g <dig>  at4g <dig> and at1g <dig>  showed no difference in ptodc <dig> growth compared to the wild-type col-0; however, an interruption in gene at1g <dig> , encoding mlo <dig> showed a ten-fold decrease in ptodc <dig> growth . to further assess if this locus plays a role in resistance of arabidopsis to ptodc <dig> we tested an additional t-dna insertion line in at1g <dig> . bacterial growth was reduced by approximately 10-fold in mlo2- <dig> compared to col- <dig> wildtype  indicating that the mlo <dig> mutation increases resistance to ptodc <dig> 

the mlo2- <dig>  mutant of arabidopsis, which is a point mutant  in mlo <dig> figure 3b), was previously identified in a genetic screen for mutants showing enhanced resistance to powdery mildew  <cit> . however, unlike mlo2- <dig> and mlo2- <dig>  but consistent with the previous report  <cit> , mlo2- <dig>  does not exhibit any significant change in p. syringae growth compared to col- <dig> .

hopz <dig> targets arabidopsis mlo2
we further examined whether knocking out mlo <dig> would affect the virulence advantage normally conferred by hopz <dig> when carried by the weak arabidopsis pathogen p. syringae pv. cilantro 0788- <dig> . we infiltrated arabidopsis col- <dig> and mlo2- <dig> leaves with pci0788- <dig> carrying either an empty vector  or hopz <dig>  as previously observed  <cit> , hopz <dig> conferred a virulence advantage to pci0788- <dig> in col- <dig>  but the hopz2-associated virulence advantage was compromised in the mlo2- <dig> line , indicating mlo <dig> is required for hopz2-associated virulence.

to determine whether hopz <dig> and mlo <dig> interact in planta, we created fusions between both hopz2c/a and mlo <dig> to the n- or c-terminus of yfp  in a glucocorticoid-inducible conditional expression vector. we used a partial clone of mlo <dig> beginning at amino acid residue  <dig> of the full-length protein and containing the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th transmembrane domains as well as the c-terminal cytosolic tail of the protein , corresponding to the fragment of the clone in our cdna prey library .

we infiltrated equivalent optical densities of agrobacterium carrying hopz2::nyfp, hopz2c/a::nyfp or hopz1c::nyfp with mlo2Δ1-280::cyfp, as well as the reciprocal combination. we used hopz1c as a negative control because it did not interact with mlo <dig> in our yeast two-hybrid screening . protein expression was induced by spraying the plants with dexamethasone post-infiltration.  <dig> and  <dig> hours after dexamethasone application we observed bright fluorescence in leaf sections co-infiltrated with hopz2::nyfp or hopz2c/a::nyfp and mlo2Δ1-280::cyfp, as well as the reciprocal combination . no fluorescence was observed with hopz1c::nyfp and mlo2Δ1-280::cyfp  at these time points. the interaction between mlo2Δ1- <dig> and hopz <dig> localized to the periphery of the cell suggestive of the plasma membrane as well as reticulate network reminiscent of the endoplasmic reticulum . this localization pattern was also observed when an mlo2Δ1-280::yfp fusion was transiently expressed in n. benthamiana .

discussion
we developed qis-seq, a quantitative, high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screening protocol combined with illumina next-generation sequencing, to identify putative interacting proteins with the hopz family of type iii effector proteins. qis-seq provides many significant advances over traditional interactor screens:  it eliminates the need to individually sequence each interacting colony while at the same time vastly increasing the number of candidates interrogated;  the results are quantitative and therefore amenable to statistical analysis;  the method explicitly evaluates the enrichment of each interactor relative to both its presence in the prey library as well as its general  stickiness;  sequencing of the prey library provides a hereto unprecedented ability to evaluate the cdna library for complexity and completeness;  it is amenable to any type of yeast two-hybrid screen;  it is amenable to any type of next-generation sequencing;  it is completely scalable and therefore applicable to experiments run in a very small, multiplex format, to very large automated, high-throughput screens; and  the quantitative nature of the data also enhances the method's 'portability' among laboratories.

a number of these points are worth elaborating. the ability to interrogate putative interactors relative to their presences in the prey library  is particularly critical when not working with well-established model systems. one of the great benefits of next-generation sequencing is the ability to more easily study non-model systems. by definition, these systems have few established genomic resources, such as normalized cdna libraries. the in silico normalization provided by qis-seq facilitates the use of any prey library, regardless of its means of preparation. for example, tissue, cell, age or stage-specific libraries could be rapidly constructed and tested without the need for tedious and sample consuming normalization steps.

portability in the context mentioned in point  <dig>  means that standards can be established for experimental design, data collection, and data analysis, which will allow experimental results to be comparable among laboratories. examples of such portability standards included the miame   <cit>  and migs  specifications  <cit> . another benefit of these standards is that it encourages the development of data repositories and meta-analysis tools such as the bio-array resource  <cit>  for microarray data.

a potential criticism of qis-seq is its cost-effectiveness, since the cost of next-generation sequencing is not trivial. currently, it cost between us$1000-us$ <dig> for a single channel of illumina next-generation data . while we sequenced to quite high coverage in this proof-of-principle study, this depth is not generally required, and we found that  <dig> million reads were more than adequate. since the current illumina hiseq <dig> platform currently produces over  <dig> million reads per lane, it should be possible to multiplex as many as  <dig> samples per channel. importantly, bar-codes can be directly incorporated onto the primers used to amplify the prey-plasmid inserts, thereby permitting the pooling of independent samples prior to illumina sample prep. early pooling of bar-coded samples means that only one sample prep is required for all pooled samples, and consequently, while the cost for a single channel of illumina data may be us$ <dig>  the cost per sample  would only be us$ <dig>  this price is substantially less than the cost for sanger sequencing  <dig> clones, and the cost will only continue to drop as the next-generation sequencing technology improves.

since we had previously shown that hopz <dig> confers a virulence advantage to p. syringae in arabidopsis, we therefore rationalized that we could use hopz <dig> as a probe for the identification of innate immunity components. by conducting qis-seq screens on all members of the hopz family, we were able to identify proteins that interact specifically with hopz <dig>  these hopz <dig> interactors were enriched for membrane-associated proteins as well as proteins from genes induced during stress responses, including arabidopsis mlo <dig>  the lack of interaction between mlo <dig> and the other hopz family members suggests that the hopz family has diversified to target different host proteins.

mlo <dig> has seven transmembrane domains with an extracellular n-terminus and an intracellular c-terminus and is localized to the plasma membrane  <cit> . hopz <dig> is normally present at the plasma membrane and would be ideally localized to interact with mlo <dig>  <cit> . our analysis identified a partial clone of mlo <dig> starting just prior to the fourth transmembrane domain and including the entire intracellular c-terminus . using mlo2Δ1- <dig> in bifc analyses, we demonstrated that hopz <dig> and mlo <dig> interact directly in planta. however, the observed fluorescence complementation localized to a reticulate structure reminiscent of the er as well as the plasma membrane. this localization was also observed with mlo2Δ1-280::yfp , suggesting that mlo2Δ1- <dig> may be partially mislocalized.

the mlo gene was first identified by map-based cloning in barley from mutants that were resistant to the powdery mildew fungal pathogen blumeria  graminis f. sp. hordei   <cit> . however, mlo-based resistance in crop species has been employed by plant breeders for decades  <cit> . as in barley, arabidopsis mlo <dig> confers increased resistance to a powdery mildew fungal pathogen, golonivomyces  orontii  <cit> . however, it has been reported  that p. syringae growth did not significantly differ in mlo <dig> compared to col- <dig>  <cit> . vogel and colleagues  <cit>  evaluated symptom production in mlo <dig>  point mutants when infiltrated or sprayed with ptodc <dig>  while consonni and colleagues  <cit>  tested bacterial growth and symptom production from ptodc <dig> in a t-dna insertion line  that is inserted towards the end of the 6th exon . our growth assays with ptodc <dig> in the mlo2- <dig>  point mutant confirmed that it did not exhibit increased resistance to p. syringae . while mlo2- <dig> , which has a d287n point mutation, in the intracellular loop between the third and fourth transmembrane domains  <cit> , confers increased resistance to powdery mildew, it does not appear to be sufficient to confer increased resistance to p. syringae, suggesting that mlo <dig> differentially contributes to immunity against these distinct pathogens. in contrast, unlike consonni and colleagues we did observe a significant decrease in ptodc <dig> bacterial growth in two independent salk t-dna lines in the mlo <dig> gene , although we did not test their t-dna insertion line . our results suggest that mlo <dig> negatively contributes to resistance against p. syringae in arabidopsis, and are consistent with the proposed role of mlo <dig> as a negative regulator of defenses against oomycete pathogens.

previous work has shown that mlo is relocalized to a lipid raft-like domain in the plasma membrane upon pathogen attack  <cit> . mlo <dig> has also been shown to negatively regulate pen1-dependent vesicular trafficking to regions of the plasma membrane associated with pathogen entry  <cit> . pen <dig> is a syntaxin that has been associated with aberrant non-host resistance to the fungal barley pathogen bgh, and is likely part of a snare complex involved in vesicular trafficking of defense components  <cit> . when pen <dig> is recruited to sites of pathogen attack, it contributes to the rapid formation of papillae, an important component of the innate immunity  <cit> . our data in conjunction with the prior studies suggest that pathogens may stabilize mlo <dig> or cause its accumulation at the plasma membrane in order to suppress pen1-dependent secretion of defense components.

there is precedence in the literature for p. syringae t3ses to target negative regulators of plant immunity. the absence of rin <dig> in rin <dig> rps <dig> plants compromises plant immunity whereas rin <dig> overexpression enhances immunity  <cit> . interestingly, at least four unrelated t3ses have been demonstrated to target rin <dig>  potentially to enhance its role as a negative regulator of plant immunity  <cit> . plant vesicular trafficking pathways are also targeted by p. syringae t3ses. the t3se hopm <dig> induces the degradation of atmin <dig>  an arf guanine exchange factor  that is involved in vesicular trafficking  <cit> . similarly, hopz <dig> may stabilize mlo <dig> in order to prevent the secretion of defense components to the regions of pathogen attack.

CONCLUSIONS
overall we have demonstrated that qis-seq provides a powerful new approach to identify protein interactions using next-generation sequencing. we used this approach to identify arabidopsis mlo <dig> as a virulence target of the p. syringae t3se hopz <dig>  since hopz <dig>  is membrane localized we used the split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system for interaction screening  <cit> . however, qis-seq is applicable to any sequencing-based yeast two-hybrid screening method. furthermore, this approach can be applied to both orf as well as cdna libraries. although we sequenced the interactors of individual baits separately, the use of barcodes will allow the sequencing of pooled baits while maintaining the associations between interacting pairs. this approach will increase the number of baits that can be screened per experiment and decrease the cost of screening individual baits. in addition, as the costs of next-generation sequencing experiments continue to drop, qis-seq promises to become a cost-effective alternative to traditional yeast two-hybrid screening approaches.
