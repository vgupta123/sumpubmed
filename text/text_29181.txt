BACKGROUND
the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses  comprise a group of human neurodegenerative disorders  characterized by epilepsy, visual failure, psychomotor deterioration and accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigment in many tissues, especially in neurons  <cit> . six genes underlying human ncls have been identified and the proteins initially characterized . naturally occurring mouse models exist for cln <dig> and cln <dig>  <cit> , while mouse models for cln <dig>  cln <dig> and cln <dig> have been generated by gene targeting  <cit> .

the ubiquitously expressed cln <dig> gene encodes a transmembrane protein which localizes to the er and the er-golgi intermediate compartment in non-neuronal cells and to the er in neuronal cells  <cit> . mutations in cln <dig> result in two distinct ncl phenotypes in humans: northern epilepsy  described in finnish patients, and variant late infantile onset ncl in a subset of turkish patients  <cit> . epmr is characterized by frequent drug-resistant epileptic seizures with onset at 5– <dig> years of age, followed by progressive mental retardation  <cit> , while the turkish patients show earlier onset and a more rapid progression  <cit> . in epmr, intracellular storage material, including subunit c of the mitochonrdial atp synthase as the main protein component, is most prominent in the cns, especially in the third layer of the isocortex and hippocampal regions ca2- <dig>  <cit> . in the cerebral isocortex the pyramidal cells of the deeper parts of lamina iii are severely ballooned, and hippocampal region ca <dig> shows neuronal loss and neuronophagy  <cit> . a frameshift mutation in mouse cln <dig> that predicts a truncated protein underlies the phenotype of the mnd mouse, a naturally occuring ncl mouse model  <cit> . contrary to human patients, epilepsy is not a prominent feature in mnd, which is characterized by progressive motor neuron dysfunction and retinal degeneration  <cit> . the brain appears to remain relatively intact  <cit> . accumulation of subunit c of the mitochondrial atp synthase, neurofilament redistribution in spinal motor neurons and accumulation of ubiquitin deposits are characteristic for mnd  <cit> .

here we characterized the spatial and temporal expression of cln <dig> mrna in mice. moreover, as epilepsy is the dominant phenotype in human patients, we investigated the cns expression of cln <dig> mrna in the hippocampal electrical kindling model of epilepsy in which repeated electrical stimulations trigger a progressive intensification of epileptiform responses, and kindled mice retain abnormal excitability thereafter  <cit> .

RESULTS
the cln <dig> gene is ubiquitously expressed in mouse tissues
the expression of the cln <dig> gene in mouse tissues was first analyzed by northern blot and real-time quantitative rt-pcr analyses. in northern blot analysis one ~ <dig> kilobase  cln <dig> specific transcript was detected in all tissues analyzed including a 14-day embryo  . in addition, one ~ <dig> kb transcript was seen in all tissues except testis and heart . in spleen, an additional transcript of ~ <dig> kb was detected . the ~ <dig> kb and ~ <dig> kb transcripts were notably weaker than the ~ <dig> kb transcript. rt-pcr analysis covering the  <dig> bp open reading frame of cln <dig> resulted in a single fragment of the same size in  <dig> different mouse tissues , suggesting that the different transcripts detected in the northern analysis are not due to alternative splicing in the coding region.

we then estimated the level of cln <dig> expression using real-time quantitative rt-pcr analysis. cln <dig> showed highest expression in liver, spleen, heart and skeletal muscle,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold higher  than in the brain . expression was lowest in 11-day embryo and adult kidney, lung and testis,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold lower than in the brain . this indicates that cln <dig> expression levels in adult mouse tissues as well as in whole mouse embryos are not dramatically different.

cln <dig> is expressed throughout mouse development
the tissue expression of cln <dig> during development and brain maturation was characterized using radioactive mrna in situ hybridization analysis. for this purpose, whole embryo sections from e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> mice and brain sections from postnatal  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and adult mice were used and the expression of cln <dig> was quantitated by a computer based mcid image analysis system.

in fresh-frozen e <dig> and e <dig> embryos the overall expression of cln <dig> was weak. in e <dig> the most prominent expression was detected in the developing gastrointestinal tract . in addition, there was high expression in the drg neurons . some cln8-specific signal was also detected in the developing brain . the expression of cln <dig> in e <dig> was similar to that in e <dig> except in the drg neurons, where no signal was detected . in paraffin-embedded e <dig>  embryos a cln8-specific signal was detected in the developing gastrointestinal tract, adrenal glands and the developing brain, especially in the cortical plate .

in postnatal mice  cln <dig> expression was quantitated in the cortex, cerebellum and different hippocampal regions. expression at p <dig> was low but specific in hippocampal regions ca <dig>  ca <dig> and the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus and in the cortex . at p <dig> and p <dig>  the cln <dig> expression increased in the hippocampal ca <dig> region  and especially in the ca <dig> region  . in adult brain the expression levels of cln <dig> were lower than at p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> in every region analyzed . when compared with adults, a statistically significant difference in cln <dig> expression was detected in the cortex at p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> and in the ca <dig> region at p <dig> . expression of cln <dig> in adult cerebellum was 156% of expression in the cortex . in all maturation stages, the expression of cln <dig> was highest in hippocampal region ca <dig> .

cln <dig> expression is strongly up-regulated in the hippocampal electrical kindling model of epilepsy
epileptic seizures are a characteristic feature in human patients with cln <dig> mutations. we therefore analyzed, by mrna in situ hybridization analysis, possible changes in cln <dig> expression  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h after kindling-induced epileptic seizures. animals were subjected to  <dig> rapid kindling stimulations which lead to increased excitability in mice at  <dig> weeks after the stimulation  <cit> . each rapid kindling stimulation induced relatively short focal  or long-lasting generalized  seizures. the mean duration of afterdischarges was  <dig> ±  <dig> s for focal seizures and  <dig> ±  <dig> s for generalized seizures. all animals experienced multiple  grade 4– <dig> generalized tonic-clonic seizures. the expression of cln <dig> in the control, electrode implanted but non-stimulated mice  was essentially identical to that in wild-type adult mouse brain . after kindling stimulations cln <dig> was strongly up-regulated in the hippocampus, especially in the ca <dig> region and most prominently in the granular cell layer of the detate gyrus . after  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h expression of cln <dig> in ca <dig> was 92%, 114% and 134% of that of controls, and in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus 128%, 225% and 286% of controls, respectively . when compared to controls, a statistically significant increase in cln <dig> expression was detected in the cortex after  <dig> h, and in the ca <dig> and ca <dig> regions, and the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus after  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h . all changes in cln <dig> mrna expression after rapid kindling stimulations were bilateral with no differences between the sides.

discussion
we analyzed the expression of the cln <dig> gene during mouse development and in the hippocampal kindling model of epilepsy to gain understanding of the role of cln <dig> in the disease mechanisms underlying both human and mouse ncls. in northern blot analysis a cln <dig> transcript of approximately  <dig> kb was detected in all tissues studied. two additional transcripts, approximately  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb, were detected in several tissues. thus, cln <dig> expression resembles that of human cln <dig>  which is ubiquitously expressed with transcripts of  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb  <cit> . the open reading frame of mouse cln <dig> is 82% identical with cln <dig> and at the amino acid level the proteins are 85% identical  <cit> . in both human and mouse genes the rt-pcr analysis of the cln <dig> open reading frame resulted in a single fragment, suggesting that the different size transcripts seen in northern analysis are due to alternative 3' untranslated regions as previously suggested for the human cln <dig> gene  <cit> . it is, however, also possible that the cln8/cln <dig> genes have several transcription initiation sites. real-time quantitative rt-pcr analysis further suggested that the expression levels of cln <dig> are relatively low in both adult and embryonic tissues, and showed that expression levels in various tissues do not differ dramatically. the remarkably low expression of cln <dig> in testis could reflect a high level of the control gene analyzed in this tissue. despite ubiquitous expression of the underlying gene and accumulation of storage material in all tissues, the most severe damage in epmr patients and mnd mice is in neuronal cells. this is also characteristic of other ncls, suggesting that ncl proteins may have a specific function in neuronal cells distinct from the role in non-neuronal cells, or that certain neuronal populations may be more sensitive to the disturbed function of ncl proteins.

in situ hybridization analysis of developing mice indicates that cln <dig> mrna is expressed throughout development as well as in the mature brain. the expression of cln <dig> in embryonic stages e <dig> and e <dig> was specific but low in many tissues including brain, but remarkably high in the developing gastrointestinal tract. this may indicate a role for cln <dig> in the innervation of the developing gut. in addition, in the e <dig> embryo cln <dig> expression was high in drg neurons. these neurons determine the connections between interneurons and motoneurons of the spinal cord. assuming a role for cln <dig> in this process, its disturbed function might result in defective connections in drg with consecutive dysfunction of motor neurons resulting in progressive paralysis in the mnd mouse model  <cit> . the expression of cln <dig> in postnatal mouse brain was highest at developmental stages p <dig> and p <dig>  especially in hippocampal region ca <dig>  the brain expression was clearly lower in adult mice than at p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  suggesting a role for cln <dig> in brain maturation. this early postnatal period is characterized by a rapid increase in the number of synapses, as well as maturation of oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells in the cns  <cit> . two other ncl proteins, ppt <dig> and cln <dig>  have been localized to synaptic areas of neurons  <cit>  suggesting the importance of these ncl proteins for synaptic functions. however, detailed study of the function of cln <dig> in the cns and different brain cells is currently hampered by the lack of a specific antibody detecting endogenous cln <dig>  very low levels of cln <dig> mrna were also detected in developing and adult motoneurons and retina . however, the cln <dig> transcript levels in these samples were virtually indistinguishable from the respective sense controls.

the expression of several other ncl genes in mouse and/or rat has been characterized. in addition to cln <dig>  cln <dig> and cln <dig> also show developmental regulation, whereas the expression of two other ncl genes, cathepsin d underlying a naturally occuring sheep ncl model and cln <dig> underlying a human late infantile-onset ncl form, is relatively constant in the rat brain during development  <cit> . mouse cln <dig> is expressed in adult mice throughout the brain, and in the hippocampus the most prominent expression is detected in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus and pyramidal cells  <cit> . in addition, human cln <dig> and cln <dig> genes are expressed at the beginning of neurogenesis in embryonic human brains  <cit> . this expression increases as brain development proceeds. expression of ncl genes, including cln <dig>  in the developing and mature brain indicates that ncl proteins may have roles not only in supporting the survival of neurons but also in the maturation and differentiation of different neuronal populations during development. defects in maturation processes could potentially lead to neuronal degeneration and loss of neurons.

in the kindling model of experimental epilepsy a rapid up-regulation of cln <dig> expression was detected in the brain, especially in hippocampal regions ca <dig> and the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus. the expression of cln <dig> increased at every time point measured, and was highest  <dig> h after kindling. whether single or focal seizures alone are sufficient to induce cln <dig> expression requires further investigation. while only cln <dig> expression has been investigated in the kindling model, expression of cathepsin d and the cln <dig> encoded palmitoyl protein thioesterase  <dig>  protein has been studied using kainic acid-induced seizures in rats as a model. both show increased expression in this model, cathepsin d in the hippocampus, limbic cortex and temporo-parieto-occipital neocortex  <cit>  and the ppt <dig> protein most prominently in pyramidal cells of hippocampal regions ca <dig> and ca <dig>  <cit> . although different forms of ncls are genetically heterogenous, they share a common hippocampal pathology, which is distinct from lesions caused by anoxic-ischemic events and is instead suggested to be a consequence of primary metabolic defects  <cit> . increased plasma glutamate levels, decreased glutamate uptake, descreased glutamate transporters as well as changes in ionotropic glutamate receptors has been described in mnd mice  <cit> . also, prominent loss of gabaergic interneurons in mnd as well as in the cln <dig> and cln <dig> knock-out mice has been reported  <cit> . alterations in both glutamatergic and gabaergic neurotransmission may both contribute to chronic excitotoxicity, hypothesized to underlie the cellular dysfunction and brain pathology in ncl disorders  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the cln <dig> gene is widely expressed in embryonic and adult mouse tissues. in line with this, and comparable with other ncl disorders, accumulation of storage deposits in cln8-associated disorders occurs in all tissues. however, as the most striking accumulation and cellular dysfunction is limited to neurons, it is likely that cln8/cln <dig> is involved in a neuron-specific biochemical pathway or that neuronal cells are more sensitive to accumulating material or lack compensatory pathways.

the cln <dig> gene is expressed throughout brain development and also in mature brain, suggesting a role for cln <dig> in maturation and differentiation of neurons and in supporting the survival of neurons. the expression of cln <dig> showed regional differences, suggesting a specific function for cln <dig> in specific neuronal populations. the relevance of cln <dig> up-regulation in hippocampal neurons of kindled mice needs to be studied further.
