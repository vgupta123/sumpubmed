BACKGROUND
the species streptococcus thermophilus is a lactic acid bacterium  used as a starter of fermentation in yogurt and cheese production. in nature and during dairy fermentation processes, s. thermophilus is subjected to sudden changes in its environment and its industrial performance is conditioned by its ability to successfully adapt to harsh conditions. to survive, like many other bacteria, this species must develop appropriate physiological responses by modifying gene expression appropriately.

one of the stresses, that s. thermophilus commonly encounters, is the modification of the temperature. for instance, during the production of dairy products, temperature shifts are applied to regulate the bacterial growth and, thus, control the lactic acid production  <cit> . s. thermophilus survival against thermal stress is conditioned by its ability to sense and quickly adapt its physiology mainly by the synthesis of adequate proteins at the right moment. for example, adaptation of s. thermophilus to a lowering of temperature required the synthesis of a set of chaperones called cold shock proteins  that is strongly induced in response to a rapid decrease in growth temperature  <cit> . as in other gram positive bacteria, s. thermophilus also responds to thermal stress by synthesizing a conserved set of heat-shock proteins , including both chaperones and proteases  <cit> . their role during heat stress is to rescue, or to scavenge, heat-denatured proteins. in lab, the adaptation to heat shock required the two negative transcriptional factors hrca  <cit>  and ctsr  <cit>  which negatively control the expression of major molecular chaperones   <cit>  and proteases   <cit> , respectively. furthermore, zotta et al.  have shown the involvement of the hrca and ctsr proteins in the heat stress response of s. thermophilus sfi <dig>  <cit> . apart from these data, little is known about the network of regulation controlling s. thermophilus adaptation to temperature changes.

among bacterial transcriptional regulators is the wide conserved family of rgg regulators encoded by genes, exclusively found in the order of lactobacillales and the family listeriaceae  <cit> . rgg regulators act by binding to the promoter region of their target genes  <cit> . at their n-terminal end, they carry a helix-turn-helix  xre dna-binding domain demonstrated to be important for their activity as transcriptional regulators  <cit> . they are positive regulator  <cit>  or act both as activator and repressor  <cit> . most of the rgg regulators control the transcription of their neighboring genes  <cit> . however, rgg from s. pyogenes nz <dig>  s. agalactiae nem <dig> or s. suis ss <dig> are considered as global regulators since controlling highly diverse genes scattered on the genome  <cit> . in these cases, rgg proteins are involved in a network of regulation and modulate the expression of other transcriptional regulators, including several two-component regulatory systems, which are important in the transcriptional response to changing environments  <cit> . several rgg proteins contribute to bacterial stress response. for instance, the rgg protein of lactocccus lactis, also known as gadr, is associated with glutamate-dependent acid tolerance  <cit> . within streptococcus, several rgg proteins have been involved in oxidative- and/or to thermal-stress responses  <cit> .

the high number of rgg genes observed in the genomes of s. thermophilus strains   <cit>  suggests that their acquisition and their preservation are advantageous for s. thermophilus. however, the involvement of these genes in s. thermophilus lmg <dig> stress response is still hypothetic and none of the  <dig> rgg genes of lmg <dig> has been studied at the molecular level. to determine whether any of the rgg genes of s. thermophilus lmg <dig> are involved in adaptation to changes in environmental conditions, Δrgg deletion mutant was constructed and its tolerance to different stresses was tested. in this study, we demonstrate that  the transcription of rgg <dig> gene from s. thermophilus lmg <dig> is influenced by culture medium and growth temperature,  rgg <dig> is a transcriptional regulator that modulate not only the transcription of its proximal target genes but is also involved in the network of regulation of the transcription of genes coding chaperones and proteases,  this gene is involved in heat shock response.

RESULTS
analysis of the rgg <dig> locus
the rgg <dig> gene corresponds to the stu <dig> gene of the complete genome sequence of s. thermophilus lmg <dig>  <cit> . however, the sequencing of the rgg <dig> gene  followed by its sequence comparison with the stu <dig> gene revealed that this latter contained sequencing discrepancies . the rgg <dig> gene  potentially encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. this protein exhibited an identity of about 30% with other streptococcal proteins belonging to the rgg family of transcriptional regulators and 35% identity  with rgg <dig> from s. thermophilus lmd- <dig> which was recently shown to be involved in a quorum sensing  mechanism  <cit> . rgg <dig> contained a hth-xre motif from amino acid  <dig> to  <dig> typical of rgg regulators and a rgg-c-terminal motif from amino acid  <dig> to  <dig> . therefore, the rgg <dig> gene was predicted to encode a transcriptional regulator.

the gene rgg <dig> was surrounded by two orfs , not annotated in the genome of the strain lmg <dig>  but revealed using the software bactgeneshow designed for small-gene detection  <cit> . indeed, upstream of the rgg <dig> gene was the shp <dig> gene , potentially encoding a small hydrophobic peptide belonging to the group i of the shp family  <cit> . downstream of rgg <dig> was the pep <dig> gene , encoding a small peptide with no similarity with peptides found in databases. although, the genetic organization of the rgg <dig> locus was similar to that of the rgg <dig> of the lmd- <dig> strain from s. thermophilus, these two loci were distinct as illustrated by the low sequence identity between the proteins encoded by them . the two shp genes were classified in two distinct groups from the shp family  <cit> . finally, the rgg <dig> locus and its flanking genes were also found in the genome of cnrz <dig> strain but missing in the genome of nd <dig> and lmd- <dig> strains.

transcription analysis of the rgg <dig> gene
in the literature, studies of rgg genes transcription are scarce. indeed, only the ropb transcription from streptococcus pyogenes has been studied  <cit> . thus, it was of interest to determine whether transcription of rgg was constitutive or not. to do so, the rgg <dig> transcription was studied by qpcr from cells cultivated in lm <dig> or cdm medium at  <dig> or 42°c. in all qpcr experiments, the values were normalized to the expression of the ldh gene encoding the lactate dehydrogenase. this gene was considered as a relevant reference since it was demonstrated to be constitutively expressed in all tested conditions . the qpcr experiments were realized from three independent rna extracts and done in duplicate.

we then investigated whether rgg <dig> was transcribed at other temperatures and chose to work at 30°c, temperature at which s. thermophilus can be exposed during industrial processes . when cells were cultivated at 30°c in lm <dig>  the profile of rgg <dig> transcripts was similar with that observed at 42°c. in contrast when cells were grown at 30°c in cdm medium, an increase of rgg <dig> transcription was observed during the growth, i.e. the rgg <dig> mrna level was more than 3-fold higher  in stationary phase than in exponential phase. the rgg <dig> transcripts level of stationary phase cells grown in cdm medium was 14-fold higher  at  <dig> than at 42°c indicating it was on the influence of the growth temperature. taken together, these results revealed that the kinetics of rgg <dig> transcription was medium and temperature dependent and that the transcript level of rgg <dig> was the highest in stationary phase cells cultivated in cdm at 30°c.

effects of the rgg <dig> protein on the transcription of its flanking genes
data from the literature indicate that several products of rgg genes regulate adjacent genes  <cit> . to determine whether the product of the rgg <dig> gene was involved in the transcriptional regulation of its flanking genes, we designed primers and used them in qpcr to measure the level of transcription of the shp <dig> and pep <dig> genes. however, the qpcr failed probably because of the small size of the pep <dig> and shp <dig> genes that did not allow the design of effective primers. as an alternative strategy, the activity of the pep <dig> and shp <dig> promoters was studied with transcriptional fusion in a wild-type and a Δrgg <dig> background. to do so, plasmids carrying transcriptional fusions coupling the intergenic region of each flanking gene to a luxab-reporter fusion were constructed and named pgicb004::ppep <dig> and pgicb004::pshp <dig>  as well as the Δrgg <dig> strain carrying a chromosomal deletion of the rgg <dig> gene. both plasmids were integrated in the wild-type or Δrgg <dig> mutant chromosome. relative levels of activity of the pep <dig> and shp <dig> promoters were determined in both strains either grown in lm <dig> or cdm , at  <dig> or 42°c. whatever the conditions, no significant difference in the growth rate or yield was observed between the wild type and the mutant. in lm <dig> at  <dig> and 42°c, almost no luciferase activity was detected with both promoters in the wild type or the Δrgg <dig> background . this suggests that the promoters ppep <dig> and pshp <dig> are not active in these experimental conditions. in contrast in cdm medium, for both promoters in a wild type background, a luciferase activity was detected at 30°c and 42°c . nevertheless, the maximum of ppep0182-luxab and pshp0182-luxab activity were 28- and 6-fold higher  at 30°c than at 42°c, respectively. in addition, the level of activity of the ppep0182-luxab and pshp0182-luxab fusions differed between the wild-type and the mutant strains. indeed, in cells cultivated in cdm at 30°c, in the Δrgg <dig> mutant the ppep0182-luxab and the pshp0182-luxab showed both a maximum activity that was 3-fold lower  than in the lmg <dig> strain . these results demonstrated that rgg <dig> played a role in the regulation of the transcription of both ppep0182-luxab and pshp0182-luxab fusions and supported the hypothesis that rgg <dig> may, directly or not, regulate the transcription of pep <dig> and shp <dig> genes. moreover, the growth medium, as described above and by ibrahim et al. , and, in an original way, the temperature were parameters that influenced the levels of activity of the promoters ppep <dig> and pshp <dig> 

study of the binding of rgg <dig> protein of s. thermophilus upstream of shp <dig> and pep <dig> genes
the results above and the presence of the hth motif on the n-terminal part of rgg <dig> protein suggested that rgg <dig> may regulate the transcriptional activities of the pshp <dig> and the ppep <dig> promoters by binding to their dna sequences. to test this hypothesis, dna electrophoretic mobility shift assay were carried out. to do so, the his6-rgg <dig> protein was overproduced in e. coli c <dig>  verified by sds-page and western blot . immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography  purification of the his6-rgg <dig> protein was performed. the purity of the rgg <dig> protein was assessed by sds-page using coomassie blue protein staining, i.e. only one band of the expected molecular mass  was revealed .

a  <dig> bp pcr amplified dna fragment , including the entire  <dig> bp intergenic rgg0182-shp <dig> region and part of the 5' end of the shp <dig> and rgg <dig> genes, was incubated with the purified his6-rgg <dig> protein. as can be seen in figure  <dig>  the rgg <dig> protein retarded the shp <dig> promoter dna fragment. the same experiment was realized with a  <dig> bp pcr amplified fragment, covering the entire  <dig> bp intergenic rgg0182-pep <dig> region including the pep <dig> promoter, and analogous results were obtained . the pldh probe corresponding to the promoter region of the ldh gene was chosen as a negative control in emsa experiments since its expression was not under the control of rgg <dig>  using pldh as a probe, no dna retardation was observed, demonstrating that rgg <dig> binds specifically to the promoter of its target genes. thus, these results demonstrated conclusively that rgg <dig> activated the shp <dig> and pep <dig> genes transcription by binding to their promoter regions.

effects of the rgg <dig> protein on the transcription of genes encoding protease and chaperone proteins
the impact of temperature on the rgg <dig> gene transcription suggested a role for the rgg <dig> protein on s. thermophilus lmg <dig> adaptation to thermal changes. thus, we hypothesized that rgg <dig> might control the transcription of genes encoding a set of heat- and cold-shock proteins including chaperones and proteases. chaperones and atp-dependent proteases play a major role for bacterial survival under conditions of heat stress where proteins tend to unfold and aggregate. based upon the s. thermophilus lmg <dig> genome sequence  <cit> , genes predicted to encode the major chaperones and proteases involved in heat shock responses were selected for analysis: clpc, dnak, dnaj, hsp <dig>  groes, groel, clpp, clpx, clpe, clpl . the two cspa and cspb genes , involved in s. thermophilus cold stress response, were also included in this study. the transcript levels of these genes were measured by qpcr on stationary phase cells of the wild-type and the Δrgg <dig> mutant grown in cdm medium at 30°c  from  <dig> independent experiments done in duplicate . in these conditions, the transcript level of almost all genes encoding protease and chaperone proteins  was under-expressed in the Δrgg <dig> mutant compared to the wild type strain suggesting a role for rgg <dig> in the control of their transcription. the difference in the transcript abundance between the wild type and Δrgg <dig> mutant strains ranged from  <dig> - to 20-fold and were statistically significant . as described in other streptococcus transcriptional analysis, a  <dig> -fold difference in transcript level was interpreted as a significant difference in expression between the strains  <cit> .

in low-gc gram positive bacteria, the control of the transcription of the clp family genes and of dnak and groes genes is primarily mediated by binding of the ctsr and hrca repressors, respectively, to promoter region of target genes. in s. thermophilus lmg <dig>  we found ctsr operators   <cit>  upstream of clpp, clpe, clpl, ctsr, clpc and groel genes and hrca binding sites 9gagtgctaa)  <cit>  only upstream of hrca, groel  and dnaj . these results prompted us to evaluate the level of ctsr and hrca transcripts  in the wild-type and the Δrgg <dig> mutant. these data revealed no significant difference for ctsr gene whereas the hrca transcript level was nearly 4-fold reduced in the absence of rgg <dig> suggesting that rgg <dig> positively controls hrca transcription.

these results indicate that rgg <dig> is a positive transcriptional regulator of heat shock proteins encoding genes in particular of hrca, clpc, clpe, clpl, clpp, clpx, dnak, groes and hsp <dig> genes.

role of the rgg <dig> gene in the heat shock response of s. thermophilus
knowing that several rgg genes from pathogenic streptococci are involved in stress response and taking into account the above data, we checked whether rgg <dig> could be involved in the s. thermophilus adaptation to heat shock. the heat tolerance was evaluated on stationary phase cells grown for  <dig> h in cdm medium  or in lm <dig> medium  at 30°c  before  and after a  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes incubation at 52°c . the experiments were realized  <dig> times independently in triplicate. using the lm <dig> medium , no significant difference was observed between the strains. an exposure at 52°c, whatever its duration, resulted in a 20% decrease of the survival of both strains.

on the contrary, when stationary phase cells grown in cdm were exposed to a 52°c heat stress for up to  <dig> min, the mutant showed a significant increase of the sensibility compared to the wild type  . the heat tolerance of the Δrgg <dig> mutant decreased gradually with the heat exposure time . between both strains, a difference of survival was observed at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes where the mutant was up to  <dig>  fold less resistant than the wild type strain. thus, the decreased of survival of the mutant show that rgg <dig> plays a role in s. thermophilus adaptation to heat stress.

the rgg <dig> protein of s. thermophilus lmg <dig> is involved in the transcription regulation of clpe and cspb genes in heat stress condition
the impairment of the survival of the Δrgg <dig> mutant cells following a sudden increase in temperature suggested that the rgg <dig> gene may act to regulate the transcription of s. thermophilus genes involved in the heat shock response. to investigate a possible role for rgg <dig> in changes of the transcription of heat shock genes, the transcript level of genes encoding chaperones and proteases were measured by qpcr. the transcript levels of the  <dig> selected stress-responsive genes were studied, in three independent experiments done in duplicate, on stationary cells of the wild-type and the Δrgg <dig> mutant grown in cdm and exposed  <dig> minutes at 52°c. our results showed that clpe and cspb genes were about 2-fold less and 3-fold more transcribed, respectively, in the mutant strain compared to wild-type  . no significant difference was observed for the other genes studied . this observation suggests that at high temperature, rgg <dig> is a positive regulator of clpe transcription and a negative regulator of cspb transcription.

discussion
the aim of the present study was to determine if rgg <dig> functioned as a transcriptional regulator. first, we showed that it was transcribed in a growth phase dependent manner i.e., in lm <dig>  or cdm , a higher expression level was observed in exponential phase than in stationary phase. interestingly, using cdm medium, it was found that the rgg <dig> transcripts were more abundant at 30°c than at 42°c suggesting that rgg <dig> transcription was also influenced by temperature. because of their immediate vicinity with the rgg <dig> gene, the transcription of shp <dig> and pep <dig> genes was hypothesized to be under the control of rgg <dig>  this was confirmed by the use of transcriptional fusions showing that the activation of the pshp <dig> and ppep <dig> promoters required the presence of rgg <dig> and that their activity was optimal under the conditions were transcription of the rgg <dig> gene was mostly expressed . finally, to confirm the probable interaction of rgg <dig> with dna, emsa experiments were carried out and demonstrated conclusively that rgg <dig> binds to the promoter region of the shp <dig> and pep <dig> target genes. together these results were in coherence with rgg <dig> being a transcriptional regulator, positively and directly, controlling the expression of shp <dig> and pep <dig> genes.

the rgg <dig> locus combined a gene encoding a transcriptional regulator of the rgg family with another gene encoding a small hydrophobic peptide of the shp family. recently, one of these shp/rgg loci, named shp/rgg <dig> in lmd- <dig> has been demonstrated to encode two components of a novel qs mechanism  <cit> . this system involves a rgg transcriptional regulator and a shp pheromone that is detected and reimported into the cell by the ami oligopeptide transporter. the target gene of the shp1358/rgg <dig> pair, called pep1357c, is located just downstream of the rgg <dig> gene, and encodes a secreted cyclic peptide  <cit> . by analogy with the shp1358/rgg <dig> locus, we hypothesize that the shp0182/rgg <dig> pair would also been involved in a qs mechanism with shp <dig> being a pheromone possibly controlling the activation of the rgg <dig>  thus, one hypothesis to explain the high rgg <dig> transcript level in cdm is to consider that the rgg <dig> transcription would be under the control of the rgg0182/shp <dig> pair and to consider that in a medium free of peptide, the internalization of shp <dig> by ami transporter would be facilitated. moreover, the mechanism of rgg <dig> expression seemed to be more complex than that of rgg <dig> since not only influenced by the culture medium but also by the temperature. further experiments will be done  to determine whether the qs mechanism involving the shp <dig> and the rgg <dig> can be generalized to other shp/rgg pairs, including shp0182/rgg <dig> pair and  to understand the mechanism by which temperature could influence the rgg <dig> expression.

on the other hands, induction of the rgg <dig> expression at 30°c suggests that this gene might participate in the physiological adaptation of s. thermophilus to this temperature. when cells were cultivated in cdm at 30°c, the inactivation of rgg <dig> was associated with a reduce expression of genes encoding chaperone and protease proteins. in bacillus subtilis, the dnakj complex facilitates substrates folding to the native state and the groesl complex provides an isolated environment for the proper folding of small protein substrates  <cit> . the degradation of unfolded proteins and small peptides is ensured by a protease complex composed of the protease subunit clpp and several atpases of the clp family  <cit> . thus, the rgg <dig> is a transcriptional regulator whose biological roles would be to control the homeostasis of chaperone and protease proteins in cells grown at 30°c in cdm. this is in concordance with data obtained in s. pyogenes where rgg is found  to control the expression of clpl, clpp, groel and dnak in stationary phase . furthermore, it was shown that clpl protein of s. thermophilus sfi <dig> is necessary for correct response to both heat and cold stresses  <cit> .

results of qpcr experiments also showed an effect of rgg <dig> on hrca expression. however, preliminary emsa results  indicated that the rgg <dig> protein did not bind to the hrca promoter region. this suggests that the transcription of hrca obviously is stimulated by rgg <dig> indirectly, perhaps by influencing the expression of another regulatory protein. such indirect regulation has already been reported for other rgg proteins  <cit>  and, in the present study, might be extended to, at least, some of the rgg <dig> distal target genes.

finally, to assess the significance of rgg-associated changes in the expression of genes involved in the heat shock response, we checked whether the deletion of rgg <dig> had an impact on the survival of the strains under heat stress conditions . interestingly, an impaired survival of the mutant was observed but only when the cells were cultivated in the cdm medium, i.e. in conditions where the difference in the level of rgg <dig> transcripts was maximal between both strains. in the mutant cultivated in cdm, the percent of survival decreased with the duration of the heat exposure. these results demonstrated a role for rgg <dig> in s. thermophilus fitness in response to sudden increased of the temperature. as observed in other streptococcal strains  <cit> , the deletion of the rgg <dig> gene is not associated with a drastic modification of the survival to stress suggesting that this regulator is not essential but important for heat stress adaptation. furthermore, our results showed that cspb and clpe genes were 2-fold lower and 3-fold higher, respectively, in the mutant compared to the wild-type strain after the heat stress. data from literature indicate that most csp proteins are required when cells are grown at low growth temperature  <cit> . thus, the rgg <dig> would negatively control the production of cspb when the latter is not required. moreover, in s. pneumoniae, the clpe gene has been demonstrated to be required for thermo-tolerance  <cit> , therefore we hypothesize that the heat sensitivity of the s. thermophilus Δrgg <dig> mutant would result, at least partially, from a reduced level of clpe expression. alternatively, it is also conceivable that rgg <dig> regulates the transcription of other genes encoding proteins involved in the s. thermophilus heat stress response. a transcriptomic analysis would identify all targets of this regulator within s. thermophilus lmg <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our study gave a better understanding of the thermal adaptation of the important dairy starter, s. thermophilus. these data showed the importance of the rgg <dig> transcriptional regulator on the survival of s. thermophilus during industrial processes and more specifically during changes in temperature.
