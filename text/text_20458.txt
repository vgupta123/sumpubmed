BACKGROUND
the renin-angiotensin system plays a major physiological role in the control of blood pressure, fluid volume and electrolyte balance. a functional renin-angiotensin system is also essential for the normal development of the mammalian renal system  <cit> . renin, an aspartyl protease, is the rate-limiting enzyme in the renin-angiotensin enzymatic cascade which leads to the production of angiotensin ii , a vasoactive peptide and major effector molecule in the renin-angiotensin system  <cit> . renin gene expression is largely regulated at the transcriptional level, although post transcriptional regulation has also been reported  <cit> . a potent classical transcriptional enhancer was identified ~ <dig>  kb upstream of the mouse renin gene, and this enhancer is homologous to a sequence ~ <dig> kb upstream of the human renin gene  <cit> . the transcriptional enhancer contains several transcription factor binding sites that have both excitatory and inhibitory regulatory functions  <cit> .

one protein that has been identified to bind to and regulate the renin enhancer is ear <dig>  <cit> . it was determined that ear <dig> negatively regulates renin expression by competing with retinoic acid receptor/ retinoid x receptor  for binding to the retinoic acid response elements  on the renin enhancer  <cit> . ear <dig> is an orphan nuclear hormone receptor that belongs to the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors  gene family  <cit> . coup-tfs have been shown to bind to a number of variable direct and indirect repeats with different spacings between the repeats  <cit>  to affect a large plethora of genes  <cit> . coup-tfs have been proposed to inhibit transactivation of other nuclear receptors through multiple mechanisms, including competitively binding to regulatory elements, competitively binding to rxr, mediating active repression via direct binding to regulatory elements, and mediating transrepression of another nuclear receptor without binding to dna itself  <cit> . nuclear hormone receptors have the ability to bind directly to dna and regulate the expression of specific target genes; therefore, they are extremely crucial to the development, homeostasis and metabolism of an organism  <cit> . ear <dig> is expressed in tissues of all major systems, and its expression has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression for normal embryo development  <cit> . ear <dig> knockout mice are viable and fertile, but they possess circadian and nociception defects and abnormal locus coeruleus  development  <cit> .

using a yeast two-hybrid system, we identified ear <dig> as an interacting protein of rasd <dig>  rasd <dig> is a g-protein that belongs to the ras superfamily of small gtpases. it was first discovered as a dexamethasone-inducible gene in the att- <dig> pituitary cell line  <cit> . rasd <dig> is an oscillating gene specific to the suprachiasmatic nucleus   <cit> . rasd <dig> modulates several signaling cascades and has several known functions. it interacts with neuronal nitric oxide synthase via capon to enhance physiological nitric oxide signaling  <cit> . rasd <dig> is also crucial in the regulation of the responsiveness of the circadian clock to external stimuli  <cit> . in this study, we demonstrate that the interaction between rasd <dig> and ear <dig> regulates renin transcription. our findings reveal a novel regulatory role of rasd <dig> and a novel regulatory mechanism for ear2-mediated renin transcription.

RESULTS
identification of ear <dig> as a rasd <dig> interacting protein- to identify the proteins that are associated with rasd <dig>  we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen. a mouse brain cdna library was screened against full length rasd <dig>  all surviving colonies after nutritional selection were screened for lacz expression using β-galactosidase. table  <dig> lists the proteins that were identified. ear <dig> is the protein for which the highest number of independent clones was obtained, with a total of three clones identified. to confirm the specificity of interaction between rasd <dig> and ear <dig>  a separate yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed by mating yeast containing the ear <dig> cdna plasmid with yeast that already carried rasd <dig>  this was followed by nutritional selection and β-galactosidase assay. ear <dig> again showed positive interactions with rasd <dig> .

rasd <dig> and ear <dig> interact in vitro and in living cells- to confirm the specificity of biochemical interaction between rasd <dig> and ear <dig>  we conducted an in vitro binding study utilizing transfected cos- <dig> cells. gst-ear <dig> was immobilized on gsh-linked beads. the gst fusion protein containing full-length ear <dig> interacted with ha-tagged full-length rasd <dig> from the lysate of transfected cos- <dig> cells , whereas gst itself showed no such interaction .

to test whether rasd <dig> and ear <dig> interact in intact mammalian cells, we performed co-transfection and co-precipitation experiments. phisha-rasd <dig> was co-transfected together with pgst-ear <dig> into cos- <dig> cells. as a control, phisha-rasd <dig> was co-transfected with pxjgst into cos- <dig> cells. gst-ear <dig> or gst from transfected cos- <dig> cell lysate was immobilized on gsh-linked magnetic particles. precipitation of gst-ear <dig> resulted in the co-precipitation of hisha-rasd <dig> , whereas precipitation of gst-tag alone did not co-precipitate hisha-rasd <dig> . this demonstrates that rasd <dig> and ear <dig> form a physiological complex in cultured cells. additionally, a co-immunoprecipitation assay was carried out using lysate derived from cos- <dig> co-transfected with phisha-rasd <dig> and pgst-ear <dig>  as a control, experiments were also conducted using lysate derived from cos- <dig> cells co-transfected with phisha-rasd <dig> and pxjgst. immunoprecipitation of gst-ear <dig> with anti-gst antibody resulted in the co-precipitation of hisha-rasd <dig> . there was no non-specific interaction between gst tag and hisha-rasd <dig> .

interaction of endogenous rasd <dig> and ear <dig> was identified in hek293t cells and the mouse brain- the existence of endogenous rasd1-ear <dig> complexes was further demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of the protein complex from both hek293t cells and mouse brain. immunoprecipitation of endogenous ear <dig> resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of rasd <dig> , but immunoprecipitation performed with a non-relevant goat polyclonal igg antibody did not co-immunoprecipitate rasd <dig> . these experiments confirm the specificity of the endogenous interaction between rasd <dig> and ear <dig> 

rasd <dig> alleviates ear2-mediated repression of renin transcription- ear <dig> binds to the rare on the renin enhancer and negatively regulates renin gene transcription  <cit> . the most important regulatory regions of the mouse renin gene reside in  <dig>  kb of the renin 5' flanking sequence  <cit> . to explore the possibility that rasd <dig> modulates ear2-mediated transrepression of renin expression, we cloned the  <dig>  kb renin promoter and enhancer into the promoterless, enhancerless luciferase pgl3-basic vector . cos- <dig> cells were transfected with pgl3-basic or p <dig> -luc or p <dig> -luc and pgst-ear <dig>  we first validated that ear <dig> acts as a negative regulator on renin gene transcription  <cit>  in cos- <dig> cells . we then proceeded to test if rasd <dig> was able to modulate renin transcription in the presence of ear <dig>  our results show that rasd <dig> alleviates the ear2-mediated transcriptional repression of renin promoter activity in a dosage-dependent manner . it has also been reported that ear <dig> is able to downregulate retinoic acid-induced renin transcription  <cit> . we validated this result  and tested if rasd <dig> was able to alleviate ear2-mediated transcriptional repression of retinoic acid-induced renin expression. our results suggest that rasd <dig> is able to alleviate ear2-mediated transcriptional repression of retinoic acid-induced renin promoter activity in a dosage dependent manner .

rasd <dig> modulates endogenous renin gene expression by interacting with ear2- we also investigated the effects of ear <dig> and rasd <dig> on endogenous renin gene expression in as <dig>  cells. as <dig>  cells express endogenous renin, as well as rasd <dig> and ear <dig>  real-time rt-pcr showed that renin mrna levels were lower in the cells over-expressing ear <dig>  renin mrna in as <dig>  cells over-expressing ear <dig> were reduced to about 48% of the control . when phisha-rasd <dig> was co-transfected with pgst-ear <dig> into as <dig>  cells, the repression of renin transcription by ear <dig> was inhibited . renin mrna levels increased to almost twice the amount of control when rasd <dig> was over-expressed . this spike in renin gene expression when rasd <dig> was over-expressed could be attributed to the presence of abundant rasd <dig>  which might have counteracted the repression of renin transcription by both endogenous and transfected ear <dig> 

we proceeded to test if alteration of rasd <dig> levels in as <dig>  cells is capable of modulating ear2-mediated repression of renin transcription. as <dig>  cells are known to express high level of renin  <cit> . we first demonstrated that rasd <dig> shrna, but not control shrna, effectively knocked down endogenous expression of rasd <dig> mrna  and protein  in as <dig>  cells. quantifications with the densitometer indicated that protein levels were knocked down by more than 48%. in addition, we demonstrated that shrna-mediated knockdown of rasd <dig> results in a further repression of ear2-mediated renin transcription . because dexamethasone is known to induce rasd <dig> expression  <cit> , we examined whether dexamethasone could counteract the effects of shrna-mediated rasd <dig> knockdown. in the presence of dexamethasone, ear2-repressed renin transcription was alleviated . this resembled the results we observed from rasd <dig> over-expression . treatment with dexamethasone counteracted the effects of rasd <dig> shrna on the ear2-mediated repression of renin transcription ; however, renin transcription levels were restored to lower levels than that of treatment with dexamethasone alone . our experiments suggest that transcriptional repression of renin by ear <dig> can be modulated by alternating the level of rasd <dig> in as <dig>  cells.

ear <dig> interacts with rasd <dig> via its ligand binding domain- ear <dig> is a  <dig> amino acid nuclear hormone receptor and is known to contain several domains, including an activator function i site , a dna-binding domain , a linker region  and a ligand binding domain . to elucidate how rasd <dig> interacts with ear <dig>  we generated six gst-ear <dig> truncated constructs  and used them to carry out co-precipitation assays against full-length hisha-rasd <dig>  we found that only full-length ear <dig>  and ear <dig> truncated constructs that contain the ligand binding domain  co-precipitated with hisha-rasd <dig> . this indicates that the c-terminus ligand binding domain, containing amino acids 194- <dig>  is required for the binding of ear <dig> to rasd <dig> 

ear <dig> ligand binding domain is required for rasd <dig> to alleviate ear2-mediated repression of renin transcription- to further investigate the binding of ear <dig> on the renin enhancer  <cit> , we performed luciferase assay using the six truncated constructs of ear <dig>  ear <dig> deletion constructs devoid of the dna binding domain markedly lost their ability to repress renin transcription . this result is in accordance with previous report which shows that ear <dig> with a mutated dna binding domain is unable to bind to the rare and ineffective in inhibiting the activity of the renin promoter  <cit> .

when rasd <dig> was added, we observed that rasd <dig> alleviated ear2-mediated transcriptional repression of renin promoter activity only in ear <dig> constructs with intact dna and ligand binding domains . this further confirms our previous observations that rasd <dig> interacts with the ligand binding domain of ear <dig>  it also shows that the specific binding of rasd <dig> to ear <dig> is essential for rasd <dig> to counteract ear2-mediated transrepression of renin promoter. in addition, it was observed that the activator function i domain  of ear <dig> was not required for its repression of renin promoter activity. deletion of the activator function i domain has no influence on either the ear2-mediated repression or the rasd1-mediated alleviation of renin promoter activity .

rasd <dig> and ear <dig> colocalize in the nuclei - rasd <dig> and ear <dig> must both be physically present in the same cellular compartment to form a physiological complex. we therefore decided to examine the localization of rasd <dig> and ear <dig> in transfected cos- <dig> cells. when transfected alone, hisha-rasd <dig> was expressed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus , while gst-ear <dig> was present mainly in the nucleus . when gst-ear <dig> and hisha-rasd <dig> were co-expressed, it was observed that hisha-rasd <dig> and gst-ear <dig> colocalized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus . it is interesting to note that the amount of gst-ear <dig> present in the cytoplasm was dramatically increased in the presence of hisha-rasd <dig> ; there was no noticeable change in the distribution of hisha-rasd <dig> in the presence or absence of gst-ear <dig> .

missense mutations in rasd <dig> abolished its physical and functional interaction with ear2- rasd <dig> is a brain-enriched g protein that belongs to the ras superfamily  <cit> . ras superfamily members consists of gtpases with high conservation in sequence and structural organization, especially within their gtp binding pockets -g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> boxes  <cit> . most ras subfamily proteins also possess a c-terminus caax box, which undergoes post-translational isoprenylation and regulates the subcellular localization and function of the proteins  <cit> . to investigate whether gtpase activity, gdp-gtp exchange by gef and post-translational isoprenylation of rasd <dig> are required for its alleviation of ear2-mediated repression of renin transcription, we generated four rasd <dig> mutants- rasd <dig>  rasd <dig>  rasd <dig> and rasd <dig>  rasd <dig>  <cit>  contains a single nucleotide mutation in the g <dig> domain, disrupting its guanyl nucleotide binding pocket. rasd <dig>  behaves functionally as a constitutively active signal transducer. rasd <dig> possesses a point mutation that lies on a highly conserved glycine residue in the g <dig> box  <cit> . in human hras, the corresponding g60a mutation drastically reduces its gtpase activity  <cit> . rasd <dig> contains a mutation in the g <dig> box, corresponding to human ras. human hras binds guanine nucleotide exchange factors  but does not catalyze the release of gdp, thus effectively blocking the activation of ras  <cit> . to explore the potential role of isoprenylation in the functional properties of rasd <dig>  we generated rasd <dig>  this mutant contains a premature termination codon that gives rise to a truncated rasd <dig> devoid of the caax box.

the rasd <dig> mutant constructs were co-transfected with ear <dig> and their cellular localization was examined. rasd <dig> and rasd <dig> exhibited a similar distribution to that of wild type rasd <dig> and were present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm . rasd <dig> and rasd <dig> were located only in the nucleus . when co-expressed with ear <dig>  the amount of ear <dig> present in the cytoplasm was visibly increased in the presence of rasd <dig> . on the other hand, rasd <dig>  rasd <dig> and rasd <dig> did not alter the distribution of ear <dig>  ear <dig> was still mostly located in the nucleus in the presence of these rasd <dig> mutants .

we proceeded to perform luciferase assays to investigate the effect of the expression of wild-type versus various mutant rasd <dig> proteins on ear2-mediated renin promoter activity in three cell lines, including cos- <dig> , as  <dig>   and neuro2a . both as <dig>  and neuro2a cells are known to endogenously express renin  <cit> , whereas no endogenous expression of renin is observed in cos-7cells  <cit> . in agreement with this, the  <dig> -luc reporter construct exhibited an eleven fold and four fold higher luciferase reporter activity in as <dig>  and neuro2a cells, respectively, than in cos- <dig> cells . luciferase reporter assay showed that over-expression of ear <dig> suppressed renin promoter activity in all three cell lines  and over-expression of rasd <dig> alleviated ear2-mediated down regulation of the renin promoter . likewise, rasd <dig>  a constitutively active mutant, alleviated ear2-mediated down-regulation of the renin promoter in a magnitude similar to that of wild-type rasd <dig> . in contrast, rasd <dig>  rasd <dig> and rasd <dig> did not significantly alleviate ear2-mediated down-regulation of renin transcription , thus indicating that the gtp hydrolysis activity of rasd <dig>  gdp-gtp exchange by gef and isoprenylation of rasd <dig> are required for counteracting ear2-mediated repression of renin transcription. to investigate whether rasd <dig>  rasd <dig>  rasd <dig> and rasd <dig> mutations will interfere with their ability to interact with ear <dig>  we conducted co-immunoprecipitation analyses. the immunoblotting results showed that significantly less rasd <dig>  rasd <dig> and rasd <dig> were co-precipitated with immobilized gst-ear <dig> when compared to wild type rasd <dig> and rasd <dig> . similarly, noticeably less gst-ear <dig> co-precipitated with immobilized rasd <dig>  rasd <dig> and rasd <dig> compared to immobilized wild type rasd <dig> and rasd <dig> . these results suggest that mutation of amino acid  <dig>   <dig> and deletion of the caax box of rasd <dig> affects the ability of rasd1to interact with ear <dig> 

discussion
in our present study, we identified ear <dig> as a direct interacting target of rasd <dig>  the interaction between ear <dig> and rasd <dig> was confirmed in vitro and in living cells. ear <dig> interacts with rasd <dig> via its ligand binding domain. in addition, we demonstrated that rasd <dig> is able to alleviate both retinoic acid-dependent and independent ear2-mediated transcriptional repression of renin promoter activity. furthermore, we showed that the rasd <dig> mutants, rasd <dig>  rasd <dig> and rasd <dig>  which have reduced physical interaction with ear <dig>  are ineffective in counteracting repression of renin transcription by ear <dig>  our current data suggests that rasd <dig> may facilitate the translocation of ear <dig> from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. alternatively, rasd <dig> may bind to ear <dig> and render it inactive in the transrepression of renin promoter. further experiments are required to delineate the detailed mechanism by which rasd <dig> counteracts repression of renin transcription by ear <dig> 

ear <dig> is involved in the negative regulation of renin gene transcription  <cit> . renin is the rate-limiting enzyme in the renin-angiotensin enzymatic cascade which leads to the production of the bioactive product angiotensin-ii  <cit> . however, despite the efforts aimed at characterizing the renin enhancer, its functional relevance in vivo has yet to be determined. in our study, we showed that rasd <dig> interacts with ear <dig>  and this finding prompted us further to investigate the role of rasd <dig> on ear2-mediated renin transcription. interestingly, we found that rasd <dig> alleviated ear2-repressed renin transcription in a dosage-dependent manner and that this novel function of rasd <dig> required a specific interaction between rasd <dig> and the ligand binding domain of ear <dig> 

the renin transcriptional enhancer contains both positive and negative regulatory elements  <cit> . among them is an unusual rare with tgacc tandem repeats separated by  <dig> nucleotides , which is required for both retinoic acid-mediated and retinoic acid-independent activity of the enhancer  <cit> . ear <dig> has been shown to mediate negative regulation of renin transcription by competing with rar/rxr for its binding to rare  <cit> . our experiments showed that rasd <dig> is able to relieve ear2-mediated transcriptional repression of renin via direct interaction with ear <dig> both in the presence or absence of retinoic acid. it is possible that rasd <dig> acts by binding directly to ear <dig>  sequestering ear <dig> from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and removing the inhibitory effect of ear <dig> by allowing other stimulatory factors to bind to the renin enhancer. rasd <dig> contains a bipartite nuclear localization  <cit> , and has been shown to be present in both nucleus and cytosol  <cit> . our immunofluorescence and confocal studies showed that a significant amount of rasd <dig> is localized in the nuclei. interestingly, when rasd <dig> was co-transfected with ear <dig>  it resulted in the movement of a significant amount of ear <dig> from the nucleus into the cytosol. this suggests that rasd <dig> may play a role in regulating ear <dig> nucleus-cytosol distribution.

rasd <dig> belongs to the ras superfamily. members of the ras superfamily are highly conserved in sequence and show high degrees of homology across species. similar to other members of the ras superfamily, rasd <dig> possesses five highly conserved motifs for gtp binding and hydrolysis , an effector loop that mediates protein-protein interactions, and a c-terminus caax box that serves as a consensus site for the isoprenylation required for membrane localization  <cit> . despite extensive similarities to members of the ras family, rasd <dig> also possesses several differences, including an extended carboxyl terminus variable cationic domain and a high basic net isoelectric point  <cit> . these differences indicate that rasd <dig> may play diverse biological roles that have yet to be discovered. this study demonstrates that rasd <dig> serves a novel role in the regulation of ear2-mediated renin transcription. in view of the highly conserved sequence and function of members of the ras superfamily, we generated several rasd <dig> mutants in an attempt to elucidate the molecular basis of the alleviation of ear2-mediated repression of renin transcription by rasd <dig>  as expected, rasd <dig>  a constitutively active mutant of rasd <dig>  was able to alleviate ear2-mediated transcriptional repression of renin promoter activity. in contrast, rasd <dig>  rasd <dig> and rasd <dig> did not alleviate ear2-mediated repression of renin transcription. this suggests that gtpase activity, gdp-gtp exchange by gefs, isoprenylation and possibly, the targeting of rasd <dig> to the cell membrane are all involved in this function. mutant h-ras inhibits ras dependent pathways and has been shown to have a much higher affinity for gdp than gtp  <cit> . as expected, the corresponding rasd <dig> mutant was inactive with respect to the upregulation of renin transcription. similarly, the caax box-deficient mutant, rasd <dig>  was unable to upregulate renin transcription, thus suggesting that isoprenylation and membrane colocalization of rasd <dig> is necessary. likewise, mutant rasd <dig>  which binds with reduced affinity to gaps and possesses attenuated gtpase activity  <cit> , did not alleviate ear2-mediated repression of renin transcription. we propose a few plausible explanations for this observation. the binding of rasd <dig> to ear <dig> and the subsequent translocation and retention of ear <dig> in the cytosol by rasd <dig> may require the gtp hydrolysis activity of rasd <dig>  thus, rasd <dig>  with reduced gtpase activity, does not effectively bind to ear <dig> and translocate it out of the nucleus to remove the repression of ear <dig> on the renin promoter. alternatively, the lack of functional activity of rasd <dig> may be due to a reduced affinity of rasd <dig> for ear <dig>  in h-ras, the g60a mutation perturbs gtp-induced conformational change and abolishes biological activity  <cit> . in another example, a corresponding mutant of ef-tu, ef-tu, has increased gtpase activity and a reduced binding affinity for aa-trna  <cit> .

when we conducted interaction studies, it was discovered that rasd <dig>  rasd <dig>  rasd <dig> had visibly weaker interactions with ear <dig> compared to wild type rasd <dig> and rasd <dig>  immunofluorescence and confocal studies further show that rasd <dig>  rasd <dig> and rasd <dig> were ineffective in translocating and retaining ear <dig> in the cytoplasm. it is also interesting to note that while wild type rasd <dig>  rasd <dig> and rasd <dig> were present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, rasd <dig> and rasd <dig> were localized mainly in the nucleus, suggesting that gtpase activity and isoprenylation of rasd <dig> affects rasd <dig> nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution. taken together, our data implies that gtpase activity, gdp-gtp exchange and isoprenylation and membrane localization of rasd <dig> is required for its functional activity in the mediation of ear2-repressed renin transcription. rasd <dig> mutants that possess these defects were rendered ineffective in the alleviation of ear2-repressed renin transcription, possibly due to a weakened interaction with ear <dig> and/or a reduced effectiveness in the translocation of ear <dig> from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

many physiological functions, such as blood pressure, exhibit endogenous rhythmic variability corresponding to a day-night cycle of close to  <dig> hours and driven by the circadian system, which consists of central oscillators in the scn and peripheral oscillators in organs like the heart, pancreas, kidneys and liver  <cit> . the expression of rasd <dig> in the scn exhibits a circadian rhythm  <cit> . this leads us to speculate about the relevance of rasd1's involvement in the regulation of ear2-mediated renin transcription. we postulate that rasd <dig> might be a player in the regulation of the daily circadian pattern of blood pressure through its interaction with ear <dig> and consequent effect on renin transcription. interestingly, ear2-/- mice displayed reduced efficiency to photic and feeding time cues entrainment  <cit> . ear <dig> is also required for the normal rhythmic expression of per <dig> in the forebrain  <cit> . might rasd <dig> and ear <dig>  together with other clock genes, work in a currently unknown, complex interacting cascade to affect the circadian control of the renin-angiotensin pathway?

there is substantial evidence supporting the existence of a complete and functionally competent renin-angiotensin system in the brain  <cit> . in addition to the classical roles of peripheral angiotensins, various studies have shown that central angiotensins are also involved in less conventional functions, such as sexual behavior  <cit> , stress  <cit> , and learning and memory  <cit> . there are also studies that show that the renin-angiotensin system is involved in neurological disorders, including alzheimer's  <cit>  and parkinson's  <cit>  disease. our identification of this novel regulatory mechanism of the renin-angiotensin system opens exciting possibilities for future research and will be of considerable interest for clinical application. the renin-angiotensin system, classically known for its involvement in the regulation of blood pressure, has been a target in the development of drugs for the treatment of hypertension. hypertension is in turn a potent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke, atherosclerosis, and heart attacks  <cit> . clinically, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system are observed to be effective antihypertensive treatments  <cit> . targeting the brain renin-angiotensin system may also be a viable option for the treatment of mood disorders, cognitive dysfunctions and even neurodegenerative diseases. obtaining a better understanding of the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system may eventually lead to the production of more effective drugs.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that rasd <dig> and ear <dig> interact physically and functionally. this interaction counteracts the repression of renin transcription by ear <dig>  since ear <dig> is also known to play an important role in brain development and circadian control, it remains to be determined how the interplay between these two proteins regulates spatial-temporal developmental and physiological processes. the results of this study could provide mechanistic insights into rasd1's ability to modulate these processes through its interaction with ear <dig>
