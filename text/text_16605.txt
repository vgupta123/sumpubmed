BACKGROUND
proviral sequences of the murine leukemia virus-type endogenous retroviruses  are genomic footprints reflecting the ancient infection of germ-line cells and are presumed to constitute ~10% of the mouse genome  <cit> . although most mulv-erv genomes are reported to be defective primarily due to mutation and recombination events, some retain intact proviral genome features, such as identical long terminal repeats  at both ends, which are formed by retroviruses’ unique replication process, and coding potential for the major structural genes  which are essential for virion assembly  <cit> . expression of mulv-ervs is mostly controlled by their u <dig> promoters located on the 5′ ltr, in conjunction with the transcription machinery that is dynamically and uniquely formed within individual cells  <cit> .

recent studies provide evidence that human endogenous retroviruses  are involved in normal physiology as well as various disease processes  <cit> . the herv-w envelope protein, called syncytin, is highly expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and plays a critical role in placental differentiation  <cit> . in addition, the inflammatory properties of syncytin contribute to the degeneration of oligodendrocytes responsible for the development of multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease  <cit> .

patients with severe burn injury often succumb to systemic immune disorder in conjunction with internal organ damage  <cit> . however, the mechanisms underlying the post-burn pathologic changes have not yet been fully characterized. the results from recent studies suggest that post-burn systemic inflammatory response is associated with the activation and/or depletion of specific lymphocyte subpopulations, such as cd4+cd25+ t regulatory cells, lymphocytes expressing cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig>  nk-t-cells, and cd8+ t-cells  <cit> . sepsis-elicited stressors induce apoptosis in the spleen, resulting in the depletion of b-cells and accompanying immune malfunction  <cit> . however, the central signaling molecules responsible for the post-burn activation and/or depletion of lymphocytes remain to be elucidated.

our recent studies demonstrated that burn-elicited stressors differentially alter the expression of mulv-ervs in a range of internal organs, including various lymphoid tissues, in a erv type- and organ-specific manner  <cit> . moreover, some mulv-erv envelope proteins were able to modulate the mrna expression of inflammatory cytokines such as il- <dig> and il-1β in macrophage cells  <cit> . in this study, we hypothesize that the differential post-burn alterations in mulv-erv expression, depending on lymphocyte types and/or lymphoid organs, may be associated with systemic pathogeneses, including immune disorder. we examined whether mulv-ervs’ response to burn-elicited stressors is specific depending on lymphocyte type and the location of lymphoid organ followed by an investigation of the biologic characteristics of the relevant mulv-ervs.

methods
animal experiments
the experimental protocols involving mice were approved by the animal use and care administrative advisory committee of the university of california, davis. female c57bl/6j mice  were purchased from jackson laboratory-west . the baseline mulv-erv expression patterns were examined in nine lymphoid organs . three mice were sacrificed for tissue collection by cervical dislocation without any treatment. the burn protocol has been described previously  <cit> . briefly, under general anesthesia, an ~18% total body surface area flame burn was generated on the shaved back of mice followed by resuscitation with saline and buprenorphine. control  mice were treated the same as burn mice but without the flame burn. the three mice from each experimental group were sacrificed by co <dig> inhalation at  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours after burn followed by the collection of the same nine lymphoid organs as above without any pooling. the burn experiment was repeated four times.

cell sorting
the collected tissues were minced, suspended in a trypsin/edta solution, and then passed through a cell strainer . the cells were washed with pbs containing  <dig> % bsa followed by centrifugation at  <dig>  ×g for  <dig> min at 4°c. following the removal of red blood cells, cells were sorted into b- and t-cells using pan-b and pan-t dynabeads , respectively, according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer.

total rna isolation and rt-pcr
total rnas were isolated from the sorted cells using an rneasy mini kit  following homogenization using a qiashredder . cdnas were synthesized using sensiscript reverse transcriptase , rnase inhibitor  and an oligo-dt primer . a set of primers, erv-u <dig>  and erv-u <dig> , was used to amplify the mulv-erv u <dig> regions  <cit> . β-actin, serving as a normalization control, was amplified with the primer set: 5′-cca act ggg acg aca tgg aa-3′ and 5′-gta gat ggg cac agt gtg gg-3′.

measurement of relative purity of sorted cell populations
the relative purity of the sorted cell populations was measured by real-time rt-pcr using cd <dig>  primers  for b-cells and thy <dig>  primers  for t-cells. real-time rt-pcr was performed using the brilliant-iii sybr green qpcr kit from agilent technologies  and the results were analyzed using the mxpro  program . cell type specific mrna levels  were calculated from each sorted cell population with the level of β-actin as a normalization control, using the same primer set as above. the relative purity of each cell population was calculated with the assumption that there are only b- and t-cells in each sorted cell population and cd <dig> and thy <dig> are exclusively expressed in b-cells and t-cells, respectively.

densitometry and statistical analysis
the density of the pcr products was measured using kodak molecular imaging software version  <dig> . <dig> . all optical densities were measured based on mass values with the hi-lo™ dna marker . the density of each mulv-erv u <dig> band was normalized to its corresponding β-actin value to obtain the relative intensity of each u <dig> band. differences in the relative intensity of the matching mulv-erv u <dig> bands between no burn and burn were calculated as fold changes. statistical significance  of fold changes between the matching pairs  of the individual u <dig> bands was determined using the data from four burn experiments and student’s t-test.

cloning and sequencing
eighty-eight mulv-erv u <dig> pcr amplicons/bands, which had contrasting densities between individual no burn and burn pairs, were selected for sequence analyses. the pcr amplicons were purified using the qiaquick gel extraction kit  and then cloned into the pgem®-t easy vector . three clones were prepared from each u <dig> pcr amplicon/band. the plasmid dnas were prepared using a qiaprep spin miniprep kit  for sequencing analysis. sequencing was performed at a core sequencing facility at the university of california, davis.

alignment and phylogenetic analyses
from a total of  <dig> u <dig> sequences,  <dig> unique u <dig> sequences were identified using seqman pro version  <dig> . <dig> . multiple sequence alignment of the  <dig> unique u3s was performed using the clustal w method in megalign , and a phylogenetic tree was generated by the hypertree program  <cit> . seven u <dig> sequences, representing the seven phylogenetic branches, were subjected to a multiple alignment analysis to examine the u <dig> sequence features of direct repeats , insertion of  <dig> nucleotides, and unique region  based on the protocol by tomonaga et al. <cit> .

profiling of transcription regulatory elements
the  <dig> unique mulv-erv u <dig> sequences were surveyed for putative transcription regulatory elements using the matinspector program  within the vertebrate matrix group with a core similarity higher than  <dig>   <cit> .

determination of population diversity of u <dig> sequences within each experimental group
using the mega <dig> program  <cit> , the population diversity of u <dig> sequences was measured in each experimental group and compared among different groups in two analyses: a) no burn, burn- <dig> hours, and burn- <dig> hours, and b) no burn-b-cells, burn- <dig> hours-b-cells, no burn-t-cells, and burn- <dig> hours-t-cells.

in silico mapping of putative mulv-ervs and characterization of their biological properties
the c57bl/6j mouse genome database from the national center for biotechnology information  was surveyed for putative mulv-ervs with a greater than 98% identity using the  <dig> unique u <dig> sequences as mining probes and the advanced blast program . the coding potential of each mulv-erv was determined using the vector nti program . three polypeptide genes  were noted as intact , partial , or defective  relative to the references . each mulv-erv was mapped with the chromosomal location and strand orientation. the primer binding site  of each mulv-erv was identified by examination of a stretch of  <dig> nucleotides immediately downstream of the 5′ ltr region  <cit> . in addition, the annotated gene within  <dig> kb upstream and downstream of each mulv-erv locus, if any, were mapped.

RESULTS
lymphocyte type-specific mulv-erv expression patterns in lymphoid organs of normal mice
prior to the investigation of post-burn alterations in mulv-erv expression in b- and t-cells of different lymphoid organs , baseline mulv-erv expression levels were examined in b- and t-cells isolated from ~ <dig> week old female c57bl/6j mice. the relative purity of the sorted cell populations was determined by measuring cd <dig>  and thy <dig>  levels by real-time rt-pcr. the relative purity of the sorted b- and t-cell populations was greater than 93%, except for the b-cell population in the thymus . throughout the lymphoid organs examined, the mulv-erv expression pattern, which was examined by rt-pcr amplification of the 3′ u <dig> regions, was substantially different between b- and t-cells . the expression pattern of an intense ~ <dig> bp and two  lighter u <dig> bands was shared by b-cells derived from all lymphoid organs examined. in contrast, four distinct u <dig> bands, ranging from ~ <dig> bp to ~ <dig> bp, were amplified in t-cells with variable intensity depending on the source lymphoid organs. it was interesting to note that the ~ <dig> bp u <dig> band was more intense in b-cells from all four ln samples compared to b-cells from the spleen and thymus. the findings from this study suggest that the expression of mulv-ervs is differentially regulated depending on the lymphocyte type, source lymphoid organ, and erv type.

burn-elicited alterations in mulv-erv expression in lymphocytes depending on lymphocyte type, source lymphoid organ, and erv type
the effects of burn-elicited stressors on the expression of mulv-ervs in the b- and t-cells from the spleen, thymus, and seven lymph nodes were examined at  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours after injury by amplifying the 3′ u <dig> regions. at  <dig> hours post-burn, the mulv-erv expression, represented by four distinct u <dig> bands, was decreased in the t-cells from the thymus and three cervical lns , but not in the t-cells from the deep cervical ln . in contrast, there was an increase in intensity of one to two u <dig> bands in the t-cells from the thymus and superficial parotid cervical ln at  <dig> hours post-burn when there was a decrease in u <dig> bands in the t-cells of the spleen and mesenteric ln.

in b-cells, there was an induction of two  of the three u <dig> bands in the mesenteric ln at  <dig> hours post-burn while two bands  were down regulated in the b-cells of the mandibular cervical ln. however, at  <dig> hours post-burn, the expression levels of all three u <dig> bands were increased in the b-cells from the mandibular cervical ln. also at the  <dig> hours time point, post-burn increases in one or two u <dig> bands were also observed in the b-cells of the spleen, thymus, axillary ln, inguinal ln, and/or accessory mandibular cervical ln.

the results from this study suggest that the lymphocyte type , source lymphoid organ, and duration after injury play a role in post-burn changes  in the expression of mulv-ervs. it is possible that the post-burn differential expression of mulv-ervs resulted from changes in the composition of the b- and t-cell sub-populations , which have different transcription environments, instead of  the affected mulv-ervs’ altered transcriptional potentials. it was interesting to note that the post-burn increase in the mulv-erv expression in the b-cells from the mesenteric ln parallels the proliferation of specific b-cell populations in the mesenteric ln and spleen after burn  <cit> .

mulv-erv u <dig> sequences identified in specific lymphocyte type and/or injury  condition
three clones from each of the  <dig> mulv-erv u <dig> amplicons/bands, which showed contrasting expression levels between the individual no burn and burn pairs, were sequenced to identify lymphocyte type- and/or injury -specific u <dig> sequences. from a total of  <dig> mulv-erv u <dig> sequences cloned from the entire set of mulv-erv u <dig> bands examined,  <dig> unique u <dig> sequences, ranging from  <dig> nucleotides to  <dig> nucleotides in size, were identified . an initial phylogenetic analysis resulted in seven distinct branches of u <dig> sequences, primarily segregated by their size  . group iii  had the most number of u <dig> sequences  followed by group vii   then group i  . there were only two u <dig> sequences in groups iv and vi . the group ii u <dig> sequences  were isolated only from t-cells and the group vi u <dig> sequences  were unique for b-cells. on the other hand, the group iv u <dig> sequences  were identified only from no burn control mice. the other four branches  consisted of u <dig> sequences isolated from both lymphocyte types derived from both no burn and burn mice.

the results obtained from this study suggest that some mulv-ervs are selectively expressed depending on lymphocyte type  and/or presence of burn-elicited stressors. however, it is possible that an expanded saturation cloning protocol would find that some cell type and/or burn-specific u <dig> sequences are not exclusively present in one group over the other. in this case, a statistical evaluation may be needed to determine the specificity of the u <dig> sequences in regard to the lymphocyte type and/or burn-elicited stressors.

characteristics of seven u <dig> sequences representing the phylogenetic branches
seven representative u <dig> sequences, which were chosen from the seven main phylogenetic branches, were subjected to an alignment analysis using reference sequences to characterize their sequence features, such as direct repeats, unique sequence, and an insertion of  <dig> nucleotides. these u <dig> sequence features were utilized as key parameters for the in silico determination of the mulv-erv tropism traits  <cit> . the u <dig> sequences of the groups i and ii had an insertion of  <dig> nucleotides, which is consistent with their relatively large size compared to the other five branches . there was a well-conserved tata box in all seven u <dig> sequences; however, each u <dig> sequence retained a unique profile in regard to the direct repeats  and the unique sequence . the specific features of the individual u <dig> sequences were translated into the tropism traits of the respective putative mulv-ervs  <cit> . however, the sequences features of the group vi u <dig> sequences were too diverse to predict its tropism trait.

evidence for post-burn increase in the expression of specific mulv-ervs
the population diversity of the u <dig> sequences  was measured in each experimental group and compared among the groups in two different analyses  <cit> : i) no burn, burn- <dig> hours, and burn- <dig> hours, and ii) no burn-b-cells, burn- <dig> hours-b-cells, no burn-t-cells, and burn- <dig> hours-t-cells. the results from the first diversity analysis revealed that the u <dig> population of the burn- <dig> hours group was substantially less heterogeneous compared to the other two groups  . in contrast, it appears that there was an increase in diversity among the u <dig> population in the burn- <dig> hours group. the finding of decreased u <dig> population diversity within the burn- <dig> hours group was confirmed by its negative score for the tajima’s neutrality test in comparison to the positive values of the other two groups  <cit> . the results from the second diversity analysis demonstrated that there is a decrease in u <dig> population diversity in both burn- <dig> hours-b-cells and burn- <dig> hours-t-cells groups in comparison to the no burn controls. furthermore, it was apparent that at the  <dig> hours time point, the u <dig> population in b-cells from both no burn and burn were less diverse in comparison to t-cells’ u <dig> population.

the findings from these diversity analyses indicate that burn-elicited stressors lead to the induction of specific mulv-ervs in a time after injury-dependent manner, and the population of mulv-ervs expressed in t-cells is more heterogeneous than the population in b-cells.

differential transcription potentials of mulv-erv u3-promoter sequences
the u <dig> sequence on the 5′ ltr, which is presumed to be identical to the u <dig> of the 3′ ltr, serves as an erv promoter. in this study, the transcription potentials of the  <dig> unique u3-promoter sequences were surveyed for transcription regulatory elements . nine tres were predominantly present in the u <dig> sequences isolated from both b- and t-cells of burn mice at the  <dig> hours and/or  <dig> hours time points compared to the u <dig> sequences from no burn mice . among the nine tres are brnf , aire , and nrf <dig> , which have been reported to be linked to various stress responses  <cit> . furthermore, it appears that three tres occurred more often in the u <dig> sequences of b-cells than t-cells whereas the u <dig> sequences from t-cells had a higher frequency of  <dig> other tres in comparison to b-cells . among the  <dig> tres, mazf , gata  and mef <dig>  have been reported to be involved in t-cell activation  <cit> . a total of  <dig> tres, including the  <dig> tres described above, were identified from the  <dig> unique sequences, and the comprehensive tre profiles were summarized in additional file 2: table s <dig> and additional file 3: table s <dig> 

numbers indicate the occurrence frequency of specific tres  within the  <dig> unique u3-promoter sequences. please refer to  for the complete list of tre abbreviations.

it is probable that the tres , which were mapped on the u <dig> sequences almost exclusively derived from burn mice, are closely associated with the modulation of mulv-erv expression in conjunction with a transcription environment dynamically formulated by burn-elicited stressors.

in silico cloning and characterization of putative mulv-ervs harboring the unique u <dig> sequences
to investigate the biological properties of the putative mulv-ervs harboring the u <dig> sequences identified in this study, the c57bl/6j mouse genome was surveyed to map the proviral loci using the  <dig> unique u <dig> sequences as mining probes. from the in silico mining experiment,  <dig> ervs were found with two identical ltr sequences at both ends and two, muerv- <dig> and muerv- <dig>  retained slightly different ltr sequences due to a few point mutations. forty-nine of the  <dig> putative mulv-ervs identified from this survey, including  <dig> full-length proviruses retaining a set of intact coding potentials for gag, pol and env polypeptides, have been reported in previous studies  <cit> . the two newly identified mulv-ervs are: one full-length provirus  with intact coding potentials and one defective provirus  . an analysis of the primer binding site revealed that both mulv-ervs had the trnagln priming sequence. all  <dig> putative mulv-ervs were mapped using the u <dig> probes derived from both no burn and burn mice, except for bm-a- <dig> e  <cit> , which was identified using a u <dig> probe unique for b-cells of burn mice. on the other hand,  <dig> putative mulv-erv loci were retrieved using u <dig> probes exclusively isolated from t-cells. future studies focusing on the biological properties of these putative mulv-ervs would be of interest: 1) effects  of their replication on immune cells in conjunction with infection followed by random integration into the genome and 2) functions  of their gene products .

identification of genes neighboring the mulv-erv loci
the u <dig> promoter and the enhancer sequences embedded in mulv-ervs can affect the transcriptional activities of the neighboring genes via the promotion/repression of transcription, and alternative splicing and polyadenylation  <cit> . in this study, we identified the genes located within  <dig> kb upstream and downstream of each mulv-erv integration site. of a total of  <dig> genes identified, nine genes had mulv-ervs integrated into their introns . it will be interesting to examine how the expression patterns  of these proviruses are correlated with the expression of the relevant genes, for example, the relationship between bm-a- <dig> e mulv-erv, which was identified using a u <dig> probe uniquely identified from the b-cells of burn mice, and camk2b  locus. the camk2b expression is associated with t-cell activation and cytotoxic t-cell activity  <cit> . it is possible that the burn-elicited stressors may affect the promoter and/or enhancer activities of certain mulv-ervs paralleling modulation of the expression of adjacent genes in a specific lymphocyte type.

CONCLUSIONS
it is expected that burn injury elicits a range of stress signals that are directly linked to pathologic changes in the immune system and other organs  <cit> . the majority of the underlying mechanisms regarding how these stressors contribute to post-burn pathogenesis still remain to be characterized. the findings from this study suggest that certain mulv-ervs are differentially modulated depending on the lymphocyte type, location of lymphoid organ, and duration after injury in conjunction with the burn-elicited stressors. as a result of activation of certain mulv-ervs following burn injury, the gene products and/or newly produced virus particles of the activated ervs may participate in specific burn pathogeneses, such as immune disorder and cytotoxicity, in a cell type-specific manner. in fact, our laboratory has reported that some mulv-ervs are activated in the liver of mice after burn injury which resulted in evident hepatic damage  <cit> . further investigations are needed to elucidate the link between lymphocyte type-specific post-burn mulv-erv activation and systemic inflammatory disorder as well as the other aspects of burn pathogeneses.
