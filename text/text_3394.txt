BACKGROUND
caesarean section of bitches is a well recognized painful condition in dogs  <cit> . it can be classified as a soft tissue surgery like ovariohysterectomy. in order to relief pain in peri-operative conditions, nsaids proved to be much helpful. several nsaids are approved for the treatment of peri-operative pain in dogs and cimicoxib, a newly registered drug in european union, has such a claim. however, in case of caesarean section, treatment of post-operative pain with nsaids is not a common practice. the main concerns of using nsaids are the transfer of the drugs into milk and its impact on the suckling pups  <cit> . at present, studies evaluating the transfer of nsaids into the milk of bitches are not published. the excretion of nsaids into milk was essentially studied in dairy cows in order to calculate withdrawal periods for a consumer protection purpose . the excretion rates of these drugs into milk are generally quite low . however, excretion of selective cox- <dig> inhibitors  in dairy milk is not described as these drugs are not yet approved in food animals. coxibs being more lipophilic than classical nsaids  <cit> , their excretion rate into milk might be higher.fig.  <dig> mean concentration-time profiles of cimicoxib  in plasma and milk of  <dig> bitches after a single oral tablet administration of a dose of 2 mg/kg  given just after whelping  and 28 days later . on d <dig>  the milk concentration corresponds to the average out of  <dig> values for the time point of 1 h, out of  <dig> values for the time points of  <dig> and 4 h and out of  <dig> values for the time point of 8 h



in human medicine, nsaids are regularly used for the treatment of post-operative pain after elective or unscheduled caesarean section . use of these drugs is associated with faster recovery and lower requirements of opioid drugs . the excretion of coxibs into human milk was studied with parecoxib  <cit> . the obtained milk concentrations of parecoxib and its active metabolite valdecoxib were quite low resulting in low exposure rates of the suckling children. the authors concluded that the administration of parecoxib to lactating women after cesarean delivery is unlikely to cause adverse effects in breastfed infants.

thus, the main aim of the present study was to provide some information regarding the transfer of cimicoxib into the milk of bitches for the potential use of the drug in post-caesarean pain relief. the second aim of the study was to evaluate the transfer of the drug from the milk into the suckling pups.

RESULTS
all  <dig> bitches whelped without any complication and gave birth to  <dig> pups. the bitches were dosed successfully on study day  <dig> and  <dig> with no post-dosing vomiting. all bitches lost weight  from study day  <dig> until study day  <dig>  a decrease in bodyweight is not unexpected with lactating bitches. all pups were still alive on day  <dig> and they gained bodyweight from study day 7/ <dig> to study day  <dig>  on day  <dig>  one pup was missing and was presumed to have been eaten by its mother. for all other pups, no abnormalities were detected during the scheduled veterinary examinations or clinical assessments. cimicoxib was well tolerated in the bitches and in the pups throughout the study.

mean concentration-time profiles of cimicoxib in plasma and in milk of the bitches are presented in fig.  <dig>  after administration on d <dig>  the mean observed plasma cmax was  <dig>  μg/ml  and the mean observed occurrence time of the cmax, tmax, was  <dig>  h . the mean terminal half-life, t½λz, was  <dig>  h . the mean area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to the infinity, aucinf, was  <dig>  μg.h/ml . the extrapolated part was low with a mean value of  <dig>  % . the total clearance, cl_f, was  <dig>  l/h.kg . the mean residence time extrapolated to the infinity, mrtinf, led to a mean value of  <dig>  h . after administration on d <dig>  the mean observed cmax was  <dig>  μg/ml  which was not statistically higher than after administration on d <dig>  the mean observed tmax was  <dig>  h  which was close to the value obtained on d <dig> and not statistically different. the mean terminal half-life, t½λz, was  <dig>  h  which was somewhat longer than after administration on d <dig>  but the difference was not statistically significant. the mean aucinf was  <dig>  μg.h/ml . the extrapolated part was still low with a mean value of  <dig>  % . the aucinf value was statistically higher  than the mean value obtained on d <dig>  the total clearance, cl_f, was  <dig>  l/h.kg  and was statistically lower  than the clearance calculated on d <dig>  the mean mrtinf was  <dig>  h .

in milk, after administration on d <dig>  the mean observed cmax was  <dig>  μg/ml  which was about twice the value obtained in plasma on d <dig>  the mean tmax, was  <dig>  h . the mean area under the concentration-time curve until the last measurable time point, auclast, was  <dig>  μg.h/ml . this value was also about twice the value obtained in plasma on d <dig>  the mean residence time until the last measurable time point, mrtlast was  <dig>  h . after administration on d <dig>  milk samples could not be collected at every time point for all bitches because they produced much less milk than on d <dig>  as the missing time points were located in the last elimination phase, only the observed cmax and the tmax could be obtained in the milk samples. the mean observed cmax was  <dig>  μg/ml  and the mean observed tmax was  <dig>  h  which was close to the value obtained on d <dig> 

for the pups, the time lapse between suckling and the first blood collection time point  ranged from  <dig> to 29 min. out of  <dig> sampled pups, only  <dig> animals had a plasma sample with very low cimicoxib concentrations, slightly above the limit of quantification. both samples were taken  <dig>  and 24 h after dosing the bitch. in the plasma samples of all the other puppies, the concentration of cimicoxib remained below the limit of quantification. thus, although cimicoxib reached high concentrations in the milk of the bitches, the amount taken and/or absorbed by the pups is quite low.

discussion
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on excretion of nsaids into dog milk and on subsequent concentrations reached in suckling pups. pharmacokinetics of cimicoxib were also described in other monogastric species: horses  <cit>  and donkeys  <cit> . compared to published pharmacokinetic data in dogs  <cit> , the bitches in the present study could seem extensive metabolising animals. indeed, the obtained terminal half-lives in plasma for days  <dig> and  <dig> were within a range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  h, whereas the mean terminal half-life in “poor metabolizers” was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h  <cit> . the obtained mean terminal half-live on d <dig>  was even somewhat lower than the published value . the mean value obtained on d <dig>  was closer to the published value. terminal half-life is a hybrid parameter depending both on volumes of distribution and on total body clearance. lactation is known to modify both parameters with an increase in volume of distribution and/or an increase in clearance  <cit> . however, the most often encountered situation is an increase in total body clearance during early lactation  <cit>  and hence a decrease in terminal half-life of drugs. this latter situation seems to be the case in our study on d <dig> because the mean clearance obtained,  <dig>  l/h.kg, is about two times higher than the clearance of non lactating dogs,  <dig>  l/h.kg  <cit> . at a later lactation stage on d <dig>  the terminal half-life was increased almost significantly  while aucinf values were also significantly increased . this increase of exposure to cimicoxib may be explained only by a decrease of the total body clearance confirming that the shorter terminal half-life at early lactation was the result of an increased clearance on d <dig>  the cmax and tmax values obtained in whelping bitches in the present study on d <dig> were close to published values in “normal” beagle dogs  <cit> . however, terminal half-life and aucinf values were lower in the present study which reinforces the clearance hypothesis.

the measured concentrations of cimicoxib in the bitch milk are higher than the concentrations measured in plasma leading to quite high milk to plasma concentration ratios of  <dig>  to  <dig> . thus, cimicoxib seemed to be concentrated in the milk contrary to what was observed for parecoxib in human medicine  <cit> . this behaviour difference between the two drugs may be explained by the lipophilic nature of the drugs and by the milk composition. dog milk contains about 10 % fat  <cit>  whereas human milk contains about  <dig> to 5 % fat  <cit> . the higher fat content of dog milk may increase the transfer rate of lipophilic drugs relative to human milk. therefore, it might explain why the obtained milk to plasma concentrations ratio of cimicoxib in dog milk was higher than the ratio obtained with parecoxib in human milk. concerning parecoxib, the volume of distribution of the drug in the dog was about  <dig>  l/kg  <cit>  which reflects a distribution essentially within body water. its main active metabolite, valdecoxib, has a volume of distribution of about  <dig>  l/kg  <cit>  which is  <dig> times higher than its prodrug but still lower than the volume of distribution of cimicoxib which is about  <dig>  l/kg  <cit> . as the volume of distribution of parecoxib is lower than the volume of distribution of cimicoxib, its transfer rate into the milk should be lower  <cit> .

despite these high milk to plasma concentration ratios, the intake of cimicoxib by the puppies seems to be very low. indeed, cimicoxib concentration in the pups on d <dig> was below or slightly above the lower limit of quantification . in order to evaluate the dose of cimicoxib taken by the pups, a worst case scenario was considered. the cmax of cimicoxib in milk on d <dig>  was taken together with the average milk intake of the puppies. in the present study, this value was not measured; however, oftedal  <cit>  evaluated a mean milk intake of 175 g in 26 days old beagle puppies. thus, as age of the puppies was very close to the age of the puppies in our study , this intake value was taken as a basis for our evaluation. subsequently, the mean intake was calculated to be 201 μg of cimicoxib, assuming that the density of dog milk is close to  <dig>  the mean weight of the pups in our study was  <dig>  kg  which is close to the weight of the pups in the manuscript of oftedal  <cit> . the maximal cimicoxib dose taken by the pups was  <dig>  mg/kg which is about  <dig> times lower than the dose administered to the bitches. pups were not weighed on d <dig> in our study and therefore, estimation of the dose of cimicoxib taken after suckling is not straightforward. however, based on literature data  <cit>  a weight of  <dig>  kg and a mean milk intake of about 100 g may be considered. taking into account the cmax of cimicoxib in milk on d <dig>   <dig>  μg/ml, a maximal dose of about  <dig>  mg/kg can be estimated. this dose is higher than the dose taken on d <dig>  but it remained quite low.

CONCLUSIONS
the presented data show that cimicoxib given by oral route to lactating bitches at a dose of 2 mg/kg had a high transfer rate into the milk with a milk to plasma ratio of  <dig>  to  <dig> . twenty eight days old puppies suckling the milk from the dams treated with this single 2 mg/kg oral dose had plasma cimicoxib concentrations below or very close to the limit of quantification . thus, the data obtained in the present work suggests that after administration of a single clinical dose of cimicoxib to whelping bitches, suckling puppies should be minimally exposed to the drug through the dam’s milk and no serious adverse effect should occur.
