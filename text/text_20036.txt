BACKGROUND
g protein-coupled receptors  are a family of over  <dig> proteins that contain seven transmembrane regions  <cit> . when activated by agonists, such as hormones, neurotransmitters, drugs, or photons of light, gpcrs stimulate exchange of gtp for gdp on the gα subunit of the heterotrimeric g protein, which then undergoes an activating conformational change that allows it and its associated βγ subunit to interact with effector proteins  <cit> . this can result in a number of downstream signaling events including changes in membrane potential, neurotransmitter or hormone release, gene transcription or other cellular events  <cit> . the gα subunit inactivates itself by hydrolyzing gtp to gdp allowing reassociation with gβγ and the receptor. unlike gtpase accelerating proteins  for small g-proteins, regulators of g protein signaling  proteins bind to the activated gα protein and stabilize the transition state for gtp hydrolysis without directly interacting with the nucleotide  <cit> . this accelerates gtp hydrolysis and inactivation of the g-protein, and inhibits cell responses to gpcr signaling.

we recently reported the screening of a focused, one-bead, one-compound  peptide library for inhibitors of rgs <dig>  <cit> . this library was focused to include features known to be necessary for the activity of a lead peptide, yj <dig>  which mimics the switch  <dig> region of gα to bind to rgs <dig> and prevent its gap activity  <cit> . this screen yielded two peptides, which have yj34-like activities and, based on our models, bind the predicted yj <dig> site on rgs <dig>  here we describe a third peptide from the library screen that has a different mechanism of action. the data presented here suggest that peptide 5nd , is a partially random cysteine modifier that inhibits rgs <dig> through disulfide bond formation between the peptide and the rgs.

RESULTS
we recently described a bead-based screen in which  <dig>  ×  <dig> different peptide sequences were prepared as a oboc library  <cit> . fluorescently labeled rgs <dig> was used to probe the library for peptides that bind rgs <dig>  <cit> . a total of  <dig> peptide sequences were obtained and, in our first report, one peptide sequence  was found to inhibit rgs4-stimulated gtpase activity. since the majority of those hit peptides could bind tightly to the rgs without disrupting gap activity, they were also tested in the flow cytometry protein interaction assay  , which measures the interaction between rgs <dig> and gαo. in this method we used a luminex flow cytometer to detect the binding of alexa fluor 532-labeled gαo to biotinylated rgs <dig> on avidin beads in the presence of amf  to put the gα subunit into a transition state-like conformation  <cit> . peptides were tested at  <dig> μm except where limited by solubility . fourteen peptide sequences obtained from the oboc screen, in both acetylated, disulfide bridged  or free n-terminal disulfide bridged  versions , were tested and  <dig> showed statistically significant inhibition of the rgs4-gαo interaction in the fcpia assay . peptide  <dig> was the most active  .

solubility in buffer was determined experimentally by hplc. alogp calculations are from ,  <cit> . percent inhibition values  are from figure  <dig>  2c, or 3a  *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig>  compared to no peptide. peptides with significant inhibition in the fcpia are in bold. *peptides  <dig> and  <dig> were previously reported as peptides  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively in roof et al  <dig> 

5nd inhibited gαo binding to a number of different rgs proteins . the ic <dig> values are  <dig> μm,  <dig> μm,  <dig> μm, ~ <dig> μm and ~ <dig> μm for rgs <dig>  rgs <dig>  rgs <dig>  rgs <dig> and rgs <dig>  respectively . the most potent effects were on rgs <dig>  rgs <dig> and rgs <dig>  which all belong to the same rgs family  and share the greatest sequence homology. rgs <dig> and rgs <dig> are in the rz and r <dig> families, respectively and show less inhibition by 5nd. linear as well as bridged versions of peptide  <dig> were tested in the fcpia since cyclization yields would most likely have been less then 100% in the synthesis of the library leaving some linear peptides present on each bead. the free n-terminal linear  and acetylated linear  peptides were found to be inactive  . this may be due to lack of structural rigidity necessary for the correct interaction of the peptide with the rgs protein or a role for chemical reactivity of the disulfide.

we next wanted to determine the mechanism of action of peptide  <dig>  a small molecule inhibitor of rgs <dig>  methyl n--4-nitrobenzenesulfinimidoate  was identified in a fcpia screen and found to interact with rgs <dig> through cysteine modification . we wanted to determine if peptide 5nd acts in a similar manner. when biotin-rgs <dig> on avidin beads was treated with 5nd, followed by washing of the beads, the inhibition of rgs4-gαo interactions was not reversed . inclusion of dithiothreitol  in the wash buffer significantly decreased 5nd activity  . these data suggest that the peptide may bind irreversibly through a disulfide bridge. to further investigate this possibility, a free n-terminal, methylene dithioether bridged peptide, 5nm , was synthesized and found to be inactive  . since the methylene dithioether bridged peptide would be incapable of forming a disulfide bond with rgs <dig>  this result supports the hypothesis that 5nd forms a functionally critical disulfide bridge with rgs <dig>  although, it is also possible that the structural change from the increased bridge length is responsible for the loss of activity of 5nm compared to 5nd. a similar pattern was seen with rgs8; the loss of activity of 5nd on rgs <dig> was much greater with washing if dtt was included in the buffer and 5nm had only a small effect on rgs <dig> activity  .

to directly test for the formation of a covalent adduct between 5nd and rgs <dig>  we performed mass spectrometry  analysis. the rgs4Δ51n protein, following tev-protease cleavage from the mbp-his <dig> construct, was treated with 5nd at a 50: <dig> molar ratio. an adduct to the protein that is consistent with the mass of 5nd binding through a disulfide bridge was observed by ms . no such shift was observed with dmso-treated rgs4Δ51n. there is also a small peak that may represent two peptides per rgs .

since 5nd forms an irreversible, dtt-sensitive bond with rgs, it was suspected that it binds covalently to a cysteine in the protein through a disulfide bridge. indeed, removal of all  <dig> cysteines  from rgs <dig> greatly diminished 5nd activity  . removal of cysteines from the c-terminus of rgs <dig> had no effect on the potency of 5nd  while removal of all  <dig> cysteines from the rgs domain did reduce the potency of compound by  <dig> -fold  . these results suggest a complex mechanism involving cysteines in both the c-terminus and rgs domain based on the discrepancy in 5nd potency on the -7c mutant and the protein with no cys in the rgs domain.

gαo affinities were calculated in the fcpia as described and logic <dig> data is from figure  <dig>   *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig>  compared to wild type rgs4Δ51n; #p <  <dig> , ##p <  <dig> , ###p <  <dig>  compared to -7c rgs4Δ51n.

to further explore the role of cysteine residues, the rgs proteins tested in figure  <dig> were aligned with rgs <dig>  to identify shared cysteines. based on the conservation of cys <dig> and cys <dig> in rgs <dig> rgs <dig> and rgs <dig>  which are all inhibited by 5nd, it was hypothesized that those cysteines may be involved in the peptide's activity. however, removing those cysteines individually  did not diminish 5nd activity  . because all the mutants used in this manuscript bound gαo in an amf-dependent manner with reasonable affinities compared to wild type , it is reasonable to assume they are folded properly. with the assumption that 5nd would have to bind within the rgs domain to inhibit gαo binding, c71a and c132a mutations were also tested. the c71a mutation did not affect 5nd activity . the c132a mutation did decrease 5nd potency, but only partially  . interestingly, c <dig> is near the gα binding site, which is also the suggested yj <dig> binding site. it is tempting to speculate that one of the multiple sites of action of 5nd is adjacent to the gα binding site , however, the a132c "add back" mutant discussed below again suggests a complex scenario.

the previous experiments tested which cysteines are necessary for inhibition by 5nd. in an alternative approach, we added cysteines back to the -7c mutant to determine which might be sufficient for 5nd activity. surprisingly, no single a to c mutation within the rgs domain of the -7c mutant even partially restored 5nd activity; not even the a132c mutant . this suggests that 5nd inhibits rgs4/gαo interactions by binding to multiple cysteines – probably in both the rgs domain and the c-terminus. furthermore, cys <dig> is involved in the actions but this is clearly not sufficient to explain them. thus it is concluded that 5nd is at least partially non-selective in its cysteine modification. these data also suggest rgs <dig> is more sensitive to covalent redox manipulations than are the other rgs proteins tested.

in summary, peptide 5nd binds covalently through disulfide bridges with cysteines in the protein and it raises some interesting points regarding the previously reported focused oboc screen  <cit> . first, it is interesting that although the library was focused to include features necessary for yj <dig> activity, peptide 5nd was isolated that clearly works through a different mechanism. this was unexpected since the library was biased towards peptides that would have the same mechanism as the lead compound. however, this bias is by no means a guarantee. indeed, there is no way to know whether a peptide like hit  <dig>   would have been found from a completely random library.

another interesting observation is that rgs <dig> is preferentially inhibited by the cysteine modifier peptide over other rgs proteins. this could be because the peptide binds selectively to a pocket on rgs <dig>  or because rgs <dig> is particularly susceptible to cysteine modification. this latter possibility is supported by the observation that a small molecule inhibitor of rgs <dig>  ccg- <dig>  that was identified in an fcpia screen appears to inhibit rgs <dig> through covalent modification of cysteines while having no activity against rgs <dig> . also, rgs <dig> is more sensitive to inhibition with n-ethylmaleimide,  than rgs <dig> . unlike 5nd, ccg- <dig> appears to selectively modify  <dig> or  <dig> cysteines in the rgs <dig> . this increased cysteine selectivity may be why ccg- <dig> has more rgs selectivity than 5nd. however, since all peptides in our library have a disulfide bond, it is not clear why 5nd  would be so much more potent at covalently modifying rgs <dig>  perhaps the cysteine reactive peptide also has some affinity for a specific pocket on the rgs.

a third observation is that there may be a correlation between peptide logp and activity in the fcpia . the order of activity in the fcpia is hit 5>hit 6>hit 2> others  <cit> , while the order of hydrophobicity is hit 6>hit 5>hit 3>hit 2> others. given the considerable error in computational logp calculations  <cit> , it is reasonable to suggest at least qualitatively that the most hydrophobic peptides have the greatest activity. this also tells us something about rgs <dig>  these data suggest that rgs <dig> binding sites, including unidentified binding sites, have hydrophobic surfaces and investigators should be mindful of this when choosing libraries for future screens.

CONCLUSIONS
we report the identification and characterization of a peptide rgs <dig> inhibitor with a novel mechanism involving cysteine-modification. although our focused oboc screen did not improve on the potency of existing rgs <dig> inhibitors with, these data illustrate points that should result in improved screens in the future.
