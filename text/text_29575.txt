BACKGROUND
methane is a greenhouse gas  with a global warming potential 28-fold that of carbon dioxide  <cit> . it is responsible for 16 % of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions  <cit> . ruminants are the major producers of methane emissions from anthropogenic activities, accounting for 37 % of total ghg from agriculture in the uk  <cit> . lowering methane emissions has therefore become a major priority in ruminant livestock production, with many different strategies having been proposed to mitigate emissions, including different dietary formulations, chemical and biological feed additives, chemogenomics and antimethane vaccines . research is also under way to determine the extent to which the animal itself has control over its ruminal microbiota, with the intention that, if the trait is heritable, low-methane livestock phenotypes may form the basis of a breeding programme to produce ruminants with a smaller environmental footprint  <cit> . if any of the strategies proves to be successful, benefits may be anticipated in energy retention by the animal  <cit> .

methane, although considered to be an atmospheric pollutant, is a natural product of anaerobic microbial fermentation  <cit> . the rumen is an anaerobic microbial ecosystem in which a dense mixture of protozoa, bacteria and anaerobic fungi convert carbohydrates to short-chain, volatile fatty acids , which are absorbed by the animal and used in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. hydrogen is formed as a result of fermentation, and it is used by methanogenic archaea to reduce co <dig> to methane  <cit> . hydrogenotrophic methane production is quantitatively the most important source of methane, although methylotrophic methanogenesis also occurs, forming methane from molecules like methylamine  <cit> .

deep sequencing of dna extracted from complex microbial communities enables many aspects of microbial ecology to be determined. metagenomics allows the abundance of all genes present in the microbial community to be determined and metabolic pathways to be predicted. the first reports of metagenomic analysis of ruminal digesta demonstrated the power of the technology, focussing in functional terms on fibrolytic enzymes . since then, several further reports have appeared, applying various metagenomics methods again to fibrolytic enzymes , and to lipases  <cit> , virulence and antibiotic resistance genes  <cit> , polyphenol oxidase  <cit> , crispr elements  <cit>  and secretome proteins  <cit> .

in the present paper, we apply metagenomics to analyse the root causes of different methane emissions in high- and low-emitting beef cattle. a recent metagenomic analysis of high- and low-emitting sheep found correlations between the metatranscriptome rather than gene abundance and methane emissions in sheep  <cit> , contrary to the expectation that methanogenic activity should be proportional to the abundance of methanogenic archaea and/or h2-producing microorganisms  <cit> . several other studies have failed to find such a relationship . the present study was undertaken to investigate the comparative metagenomics of high- and low-emitting beef steers. the animals were selected as pairs of the highest and lowest emitters from an experimental group comprising two cattle breeds each receiving one of two diets differing in concentrate content. hydrogen and methane emissions from the whole group were reported previously  <cit> , as was a preliminary correlation between methane emissions and the ratio of total ruminal archaea to total bacteria  <cit> . unlike the other studies, archaeal gene abundances in ruminal digesta, including 16s rrna genes, corresponded with the extreme differences in methane emissions from beef cattle. furthermore, distinctive differences in the microbiomes and metagenomes of high- and low-emitting cattle were identified.

RESULTS
methane emissions
thirty-six aberdeen angus and  <dig> limousin cross bred steers received one of two diets, one mainly concentrate-based and the other a forage-concentrate-based diet, with forage:concentrate ratios  of 8: <dig> and 48: <dig>  respectively. all cattle came from the same breeding herd population and were kept in the identical farm environment throughout their lifetimes. methane emissions were measured in respiration chambers and samples of ruminal digesta were obtained at slaughter 1–2 weeks afterwards  <cit> . four pairs of digesta samples for each breed/diet combination were selected, based on being which were obtained from animals showing the highest and lowest ch <dig> emissions when expressed in terms of dm intake . on average, the high emitters produced  <dig> × more ch <dig> than low emitters. average feed intake was similar between high and low emitters, at  <dig> , se  <dig> , kg dm intake/d and  <dig> , se  <dig> , kg dm intake/d, respectively.table  <dig> estimation of abundance of 18s and 16s rrna genes by qpcr in four pairs of steers with extreme methane emissions

microbial community analysis
qpcr of specific regions of 16s and 18s rrna genes enabled a characterisation of the broad features of the microbiome . although protozoa and clostridium cluster iv bacteria were on average  <dig> × and  <dig> × more abundant, respectively, in high emitters and clostridium cluster iv and bacteroidetes were  <dig> × and  <dig> × as abundant, the only difference that was statistically significant  was a  <dig> × higher archaeal abundance in high emitters. the proportion of the abundance of archaeal to bacterial 16s rrna genes ) was on average 3 % in low emitters and 9 % in the high emitters. bacteroidetes comprised  <dig>  % of the bacteria, while clostridium cluster iv and xiva were  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively. proteobacteria appeared to be less abundant in high emitters, but dna from one sample proved impossible to amplify to produce an acceptable melt curve.

genomic dna extracted from the same samples was also submitted for deep sequencing using the illumina hiseq platform. reads mapping to 16s rrna gene sequences were assigned to taxonomic groups at kingdom, phylum and genus levels . archaeal abundance was, as with qpcr above, calculated relative to bacterial abundance. as with qpcr, the archaea were more abundant  in the high emitters, reflected in similar differences in euryarchaeota at the phylum level and methanobrevibacter at genus level. methanobrevibacter abundance varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % compared to total bacterial counts and was  <dig> × more abundant  in high emitters. methanosphaera were much less abundant , while methanobacterium  were not identified or of very low abundance still . methanosphaera were  <dig> × more abundant  in high emitters. thermoplasmata-related archaea were less abundant than other archaeal genera and their abundance was greater in the high emitter in only three of the four pairs.table  <dig> estimation of abundance of 16s rrna genes in ruminal metagenomic sequences from four pairs of steers with extreme methane emissions

among the bacteria, firmicutes and bacteroidetes were not different, in contrast to proteobacteria, which were  <dig> × less abundant in the high emitters . analysis of the proteobacteria was only resolved to family level  due to short reads. succinivibrionaceae were the most abundant in all samples, averaging 88 % of proteobacteria reads, average 97 % in low emitters and 79 % in high emitters. synergistetes were  <dig> × more abundant in high emitters . at genus level, desulfovibrio was the genus whose abundance differed most significantly , being twice as numerous in the high emitters. others that were different included megasphaera, which was only  <dig> × as abundant in high emitters . mitsuokella and dialister were lower and mogibacterium and pyramidobacter higher  in high emitters compared to low emitters.

the richness and relative abundance of the bacteria and archaeal genera did not change significantly between low and high emitting animals. mean shannon index was  <dig>  for high and  <dig>  for low emitting animals respectively. mean chao <dig> index estimated  <dig> genera for high and  <dig> low emitting animals respectively .

gene abundance analysis
reads were mapped to gene sequences in the kegg  <cit>  database and analysed  in a directed manner towards genes involved directly in methanogenesis,  in a directed manner towards genes involved in alternatives to methanogenesis,  in a directed manner towards genes involved in methane oxidation, and  in a global manner to compare the abundances of all annotated genes in the metagenome. the whole kegg dataset can be seen in additional file 3: table s <dig>  statistical p values in additional file 3: table s <dig> are uncorrected for multiple comparisons. when the data are discussed within their biological context, uncorrected p values are quoted below. when multiple testing was accounted for in a partial least squares analysis, few significant differences due to kegg genes were found , but many of these were genes associated with methanogenesis or archaea, below. the genes identified in table  <dig> to be important explained the variation in methane emissions by 88 %.table  <dig> partial least squares estimates of kegg genes and diet effects and the variation in methane emissions. partial least squares estimates of kegg genes and diet effects in an analysis where the partial least squares factorsa explaining  <dig>  % of the variation of model effects and  <dig>  % of the variation in methane emissions

 genes directly involved in methanogenesis. genes encoding enzymes that are directly involved in methanogenesis  <cit>  were analysed for their abundance in high- and low-emitting cattle . with the exception of the very low-abundance formate dehydrogenase β subunit , the relative abundance of all genes directly involved in methanogenesis was similar . the relative abundances of the genes encoding interacting enzymes, coenzyme f <dig> hydrogenase  and heterodisulfide reductase , were similar to each other and to the genes of the main pathway . phosphoserine phosphatase  was similarly more abundant in high emitters . most uncorrected p values associated with the high-low differences were < <dig> , many being much lower .fig.  <dig> the metagenomic abundance of key elements of the methane production pathway centre pane: the methane production pathway, plus ancillary reactions, showing enzyme classification  numbers. left pane: the abundance of each of the relevant ec numbers in our data set. bar charts show percentage of reads mapped to each enzyme in the  <dig> samples,  <dig> pairs of cattle matched for breed  and diet . grey bars are cattle selected for high methane production, white bars are cattle selected for low methane production. for every single enzyme, within each pair, the abundance of the enzyme is higher in high methane producers than in low methane producers. right pane: heatmap of kegg orthologues for the ec numbers involved in methane production . the heatmap shows pairs of cattle matched for breed  and diet . blue represents low abundance and yellow represents high abundance. within each pair, the high methane emitters are to the right and the low methane emitters to the left. a clear pattern emerges – within each pair, these k <dig> numbers are more abundant  in the high methane emitters than in the low methane emitters



 genes directly involved in acetogenesis. acetogenesis by the ljungdahl-wood reductive acetogenesis pathway can be divided into three parts  <cit> . the first part involves the synthesis of 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate. the first enzyme is an nadp-dependent formate dehydrogenase . only two of the  <dig>  million gene assignations mapped to this gene . enzymes that involve the metabolism of formate via tetrahydrofolate  intermediates to 5-methyl-thf, including 10-formyl-thf synthetase , 10-formyl-thf deformylase , 10-formyl-thf cyclohydrolase , 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cyclo-ligase ,  <dig> -methylene-thf dehydrogenase  and  <dig> -methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase ) were present at higher abundance, but none differed significantly between the high and low emitters . reduction of co <dig> to co initiates the capture of co <dig>  <cit> ; carbon monoxide dehydrogenase iron sulfur subunit  was  <dig> × more abundant in high emitters  and co dehydrogenase maturation factor   <dig> × more abundant, though not significantly so . the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-coa synthase reaction catalysed by ec: <dig> . <dig>   <cit>  is the only enzyme that is thought to be unique to reductive acetogenesis  <cit> ; none of the reads was assigned to this gene, despite its having been found in several ruminal bacteria  <cit> .

 genes associated with methanotrophy, methane monooxygenase  and methanol dehydrogenase , were not identified in the dataset.

among other genes associated with hydrogenase activity, f420-non-reducing hydrogenase  subunits a, d and g were  <dig> ×,  <dig> × and  <dig> × more abundant in high emitters. likewise, hydrogenase expression/formation protein  was  <dig> × more abundant, along with hydrogenase maturation protein hypf  <dig> ×; hydrogenase expression/formation protein hypc  <dig> ×, hypd  <dig> × and hype  <dig> ×. energy-converting hydrogenase a subunits b  <dig> ×, c  <dig> ×, e  <dig> ×, g  <dig> ×, h  <dig> ×; j  <dig> ×, m  <dig> ×, n  <dig> ×, o  <dig> ×, p  <dig> ×, q  <dig> × and r  <dig> × and were more abundant in high emitters as were energy-converting hydrogenase b subunits a  <dig> ×, f  <dig> ×, h  <dig> ×, k  <dig> ×, l  <dig> ×, m  <dig> × and n  <dig> ×.

two genes of the pentose phosphate pathway tended to be less abundant, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase  and transketolase . transaldolase  was numerically less abundant, but other enzymes of this pathway were either not identified or not different .

other genes that were of higher abundance in high emitters included transcription initiation factor tfiib , which is archaeal, and transcription initiation factor tfiid tata-box-binding protein , which is present in all domains. the enzymes nadh dehydrogenase  and -2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase  were also more abundant in high emitters.

genes that were less abundant in high emitters included electron transport complex proteins rnfc  and rnfd , and f-type h+-transporting atpase subunit a  . acetate kinase was lower  and there were trends for the related enzymes, phosphate acetyl transferase  and pyruvate kinase  also to be lower . others included saccharopine dehydrogenase   and replicative dna helicase . of those,  <dig>  were duf domains – “domain of unknown function”. therefore a domain could not be assigned to over half of the predicted proteins, and a putative function to almost 58 %.

discussion
in the present study, ruminal digesta samples from beef cattle with extreme high and low emissions, identified from an earlier 72-animal study  <cit> , were used to pinpoint key differences in their microbial communities and metagenomes that might help explain the methane phenotype and thereby offer new avenues to explore means of mitigation. methane emissions correlated with archaeal abundance in the rumen based on 16s rrna genes and the abundance of other archaeal genes, particularly those involved directly or indirectly with methanogenesis, was greater in high methane emitters. differences in other members of the rumen microbial community pointed for the first time to a role of succinovibrionaceae in low methane emissions in ruminants; bacterial gene abundances were consistent with this interpretation. the results of protein mapping analysis from metagenomic sequences highlight that the majority of genes and proteins had no homologues in public databases and that there are many differences between high- and low-emitting beef cattle that could be useful for exploitation.

previous qpcr analysis of the whole 72-animal experimental group suggested a correlation, albeit rather weak, between archaeal abundance and methane emissions from individual animals  <cit> . it might be argued that the extreme animals, as investigated here, might give a better impression of what opportunities might be available for modulating methane emissions. the differences in methane emissions, expressed per kg dm intake, between selected low and high emitters were substantial , thus the causes of these differences might be more easily identified. post-mortem digesta sampling was used here, following our previous discovery that the abundance of archaea relative to bacteria was similar in live cattle when leaving the respiration chambers and when digesta were sampled at slaughter ca. two weeks later  <cit> .

the rumen microbial community comprises mainly ciliate protozoa, anaerobic bacteria and fungi and archaea. methanogenesis in the rumen occurs predominantly by the hydrogenotrophic route, i.e. 4h2 + co2 = ch4 + 2h2o  <cit> . the first three microbial groups provide the h <dig>  and the archaea carry out methanogenesis. it therefore seems intuitive that methane emissions should correspond to some extent with archaeal abundance in the rumen, from where 87 % of enteric emissions originate in the digestive tract  <cit> . yet, except for our previous studies  <cit> , proof of such a correlation has proved elusive . the higher proportion of archaea in high emitters in the present study was similar whether calculated from qpcr or deep sequencing reads of 16s rrna genes. the large difference between high and low emitters may explain why differences in gene abundance may become more evident. shi et al.  <cit>  found differences in the ruminal transcriptome but not the metagenome that correlated with sheep emitting different amounts of methane. we would submit that there are strong theoretical reasons why methane emissions should be proportional to the abundance of archaea present in the rumen of individual animals rather than transcript abundances. the biomass yield of the archaea must normally be directly proportional to the methane produced, since, with minor possible exceptions such as alcohol utilization  <cit> , methanogenesis is the only mechanism of atp synthesis available to the archaea. furthermore, the cytochrome-containing genera  <cit>  have not been reported in the rumen  <cit> , so the molar growth yields of the different genera that are found in the rumen are likely to be similar. uncoupling between methanogenesis and atp synthesis  <cit>  could explain a lack of correspondence between archaeal abundance and methane emissions. such uncoupling occurs at high h <dig> partial pressures in some archaea  <cit> , but is not known in ruminal archaea as far as we are aware. furthermore, the partial pressure of h <dig> in the rumen is always low  <cit> . several different archaeal genera have been found in the rumen in different species of ruminant in different geographical locations  <cit> . as found here by examining 16s rrna reads from the metagenomes, methanobrevibacter usually predominates  <cit> . the abundance of methanobrevibacter varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % compared to bacterial abundance.

a greater abundance of archaea in high emitters would be expected to be a response to rather than the root cause of the difference in emissions, unless major differences in h <dig> emissions were found, which was not the case  <cit> . the availability of h <dig> limits the rate of ruminal methanogenesis under some circumstances  <cit> . thus, methane emissions might be expected to be at least partly dependent on the abundance of h2-producing microorganisms. ciliate protozoa are major producers of h <dig>  produced by mitochondrion-like organelles known as hydrogenosomes  <cit> . they were generally more abundant in high emitters, but the differences were not statistically significant. kittelmann et al.  <cit>  also did not find links between protozoa and methane. the bacterial firmicutes phylum, of which the main ruminal members are clostridium clusters iv and xiv, would contain more h <dig> producers, particularly clostridium cluster iv in which the main ruminal community members are the highly cellulolytic ruminococcus and several eubacterium spp.  <cit> , than the bacteroidetes, which generally are net h <dig> utilisers  <cit> . trends in this direction occurred, but as observed with the whole animal group  <cit>  no statistically significant differences in their abundance were observed. stronger associations between methane emissions and abundance of h2-producing bacteria in sheep have been reported by kittelmann et al.  <cit> , who distinguished three ‘ruminotypes’. the high methane emitters generally had a greater community of h2-producing bacteria than low emitters.

highly significant differences were observed in the abundances of some bacterial taxa based on 16s rrna sequences extracted from the metagenome. proteobacteria were 4-fold more abundant in low emitters. the predominant proteobacteria belonged to the family succinivibrionaceae. this observation has a curious correspondence with the abundance of succinivibrionaceae in the digestive tract of the tammar wallaby   <cit> , which was considered to be the main reason why the tammar wallaby produces one quarter of the methane emissions of cattle  <cit> . succinivibrionaceae were just as abundant in the low-emission beef cattle investigated here as in the wallaby. these bacteria produce succinate as a main fermentation product, thus trapping metabolic hydrogen rather than releasing it as h <dig>  it may be that the main succinivibrionaceae species are different in the two animal hosts; indeed, pope et al.  <cit>  did not find any of the major wallaby species of succinivibrionaceae in cattle. nonetheless, the finding that succinivibrionaceae were much more numerous in low-emitting cows is consistent with the wallaby observations and offers a possible strategy for lower methane emissions from ruminant livestock.

other significant differences in bacteria may not be explained directly in terms of methane emissions, but possible related causes of the differences are of interest. desulfovibrio, like archaea, are h <dig> utilisers, using h <dig> to reduce sulphate to sulphide  <cit> ; their 2-fold higher abundance in high emitters might therefore be linked with a greater availability of h <dig>  megasphaera is a genus associated with adaptation of the ruminal community to low ph  <cit> . their greater abundance in low emitters could be indicative of a less stable ph in these animals. . dialister, from the phylum firmicutes, family selenomonadales, which also were much more abundant in low emitters, might fall into a similar category based on their metabolic properties  <cit> . ruminal methanogenesis is highly sensitive to low ph  <cit> , thus the cause of the greater abundance of these bacterial genera in low emitters may be consistent with a low-ph inhibition of archaea in these animals. two unrelated genera that were more abundant in high emitters were mogibacterium and pyramidobacter, both of which are asaccharolytic  <cit> . why such a characteristic should enrich for bacteria with this type of metabolism in high methane emitters is unclear. quinella spp., which were found to be more abundant in low-emitting sheep  <cit> , were not resolved in our taxonomic analysis. however, at the family level, the veillonellaceae, of which quinella is a member, were considerably more numerous in the low-emitting cattle.

relatively low values of shannon diversity reflected the low taxonomic richness and dominance of genera such as prevotella and butyrivibrio within the bacteria and methanobrevibacter within the archaea. the lack of any significant difference in diversity statistics between the high and low emitting animals indicated that the generic taxonomic composition of the microbiome was not altered as a result of the breed, diet or methane emission profile. however, it is likely that these measurements of diversity were not sensitive enough to detect differences in microbiome populations associated with methane profiles. correspondence analysis carried out on larger sample numbers  <cit>  or detailed analyses such as the quantitative pcr carried out here, was required to reveal more subtle changes in the key microbial species involved in methanogenesis.

bacterial gene abundances that differed in low and high emitters included several involved in acetate formation and pyruvate metabolism. acetate kinase , which catalyses the conversion of acetyl phosphate to acetate with the formation of atp, was  <dig> × as abundant in high emitters. phosphotransacetylase  forms acetyl phosphate from acetyl coa; its abundance was similarly lower  in high emitters. a possible alternative route for acetate formation, acetate thiokinase , was unchanged. pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase , which forms acetyl coa from pyruvate while reducing ferredoxin, showed a higher abundance of its α, β, γ an δ subunits by  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> ×, respectively, in high emitters. in contrast, pyruvate formate lyase, an alternative route of acetyl coa formation from pyruvate, had much lower abundance  in high emitters. thus, the ruminal microbiota in high methane emitters metabolised pyruvate differently to low emitters, favouring the pyruvate formate lyase – acetate kinase route. perhaps significantly, this is the route by which pyruvate is converted to acetate used by succinivibrionaceae isolate wg- <dig> from the tammar wallaby  <cit> . two genes of the pentose phosphate pathway characteristic of the wallaby species wg- <dig>  <cit>  and wg- <dig>  <cit>  also tended to be more abundant in low emitters.

it was notable that genes which catalyse methane oxidation  <cit>  were absent, suggesting that significant methane oxidation does not occur in beef cattle. reverse methanogenesis remains a possibility, however  <cit> . although some genes associated with reductive acetogenesis, such as carbon monoxide dehydrogenase iron sulfur subunit and co dehydrogenase maturation factor, were more abundant in high emitters, the only enzyme that is thought to be unique to reductive acetogenesis, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-coa synthase   <cit>  was not present, despite its having been found in several ruminal bacteria  <cit> .

multiple comparison analysis was not carried out here, for simple reasons. in table  <dig>  for example,  <dig> out of  <dig> p values are significant at p <  <dig> , which clearly exceeds the false positive rate. as this was an exploratory study, rather than one which aimed to test specific hypotheses, we considered that a multiple testing adjustment of individual p values, such as a bonferroni correction, would severely inflate the false negative rate. we therefore preferred to present unadjusted p values, leaving it to the reader to bear in mind that a few  of them can be expected to be false positives, though most will not.

among the aims of the type of methane research described here are to find proxies for estimating methane emissions – the respiration chambers used in the present experiments are expensive and laborious, unsuited to large numbers of animals - and to identify targets for interventions to lower methane emissions. here, comparisons of metagenomic profiles identified differences that characterise high- and low-emitting animals. table  <dig> describes the cumulative contribution of a group of genes on methane emissions, considering the correlations among gene effects. thereby, the effect of each gene is estimated independently from those of all other genes in the model. the order of importance of the genes may reflect therefore more the independent regulatory effects of each gene on methane emissions. thus, there are several possible strategies for identifying proxies and targets.

our results demonstrate that the rumen is still a hugely unexplored environment containing many novel enzymes, which could be of significant interest to the agricultural and biotechnology markets. from just  <dig> samples and a little under  <dig> gb of sequencing data, we were able to predict over  <dig>  million proteins, the majority of which we were unable to assign function to. predicting the function of proteins such as these  will be a major challenges facing biologists in the next decade. of the proteins we could assign some function to, the vast majority were novel, with over 99 % of them having no exact matches within nr, and the majority showing conservation levels below 90 %. we can predict their function through homology to enzymes and proteins of known function; however, undoubtedly they will differ in their ability to catalyse reactions, and some may be more efficient at their task, which would be of profound interest to a range of researchers and companies in biotechnology. by releasing all  <dig>  million proteins, with predicted domains, as a meta <dig> database, we allow researcher to explore a dataset of huge importance and impact.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the results presented here demonstrate that the abundance of archaea and their constituent genes corresponds strongly with methane emissions by the host animal. the gene abundances can now be used individually or collectively as proxies for methane emissions in genetic screening studies. the discovery that pyruvate and acetate metabolism and the numbers of succinivibrionaceae differ between low and high emitters may bring insight into how metabolic pathways and the microbial community might be manipulated to lower methane emissions and thus lessen the environmental footprint of ruminant livestock production.
