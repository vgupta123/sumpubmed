BACKGROUND
the c-terminal eps <dig> homology domain-containing  proteins regulate endocytic recycling of membrane and associated cell surface receptors  <cit> . the founding ehd family member, the single c. elegans ortholog rme- <dig> , was identified in a screen for mutants defective in yolk protein endocytosis, and is required for yolk receptor and basolateral fluid recycling in the worm  <cit> . mutations of the single drosophila ehd protein ortholog past <dig> decreased fertility and germline development in the fly  <cit> . mammals express four highly homologous ehd proteins  each containing an n-terminal atpase domain  <cit> , a central coiled-coil region that facilitates homo- and hetero-oligomerization  <cit> , and a single c-terminal eps <dig> homology  domain that mediates interactions with proteins containing asn-pro-phe motifs  <cit> . ectopic expression of each human ehd protein in c. elegans rme- <dig> mutants rescued the basolateral recycling defect indicating a basic functional similarity of human ehd proteins and rme- <dig>  <cit> . however, the presence of four ehd proteins in mammals suggests tissue-specific and/or non-redundant roles of individual family members.

the sorting of endocytosed receptors determines whether they are recycled to the cell surface or degraded in the lysosomes. receptors destined for recycling are trafficked through either a fast recycling pathway from the early endosomes  or through a slow recycling pathway through the endocytic recycling compartment   <cit> . ehd proteins appear to regulate critical nodes in the endocytic sorting/recycling process  <cit> . several lines of evidence suggest that ehd <dig> regulates the rate of erc to cell surface trafficking in the slow recycling pathway. overexpression of a dominant-negative mouse ehd <dig> mutant  disrupted the morphology of the erc and slowed the exit of transferrin from the erc  <cit> . knock-down of ehd <dig> using sirna delayed the release of transferrin and decreased surface levels of β <dig> integrin due to reduced recycling from the erc  <cit> . co-overexpression studies demonstrated that recycling of the major histocompatibility complex  class i molecule h-2dd from an intracellular compartment to the cell surface was increased with ehd <dig> overexpression  <cit>  and ehd <dig> depletion led to retention of mhc class i in a compact pericentriolar compartment reminiscent of the erc  <cit> . ehd <dig> also maintains the perinuclear localization of glucose transporter  <dig> in cultured adipocytes  <cit>  and positively regulates the kinetics of endosome-to-golgi retrieval of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor  <cit> .

we previously suggested that ehd <dig> regulates the ee to erc transport of transferrin based on sirna-mediated depletion of ehd <dig>  <cit> . in support of this hypothesis, ehd <dig> depletion led to retention of recycling-destined transferrin or mhc class i and lysosome-destined low-density lipoproteins in enlarged ees, suggesting that ehd <dig> regulates the rate of exit of trafficking receptors from the ees towards both the erc and lysosomal degradation routes  <cit> . in neuronal cells, ehd <dig>  also mediates formation of clathrin-independent macroendosomes of trka and trkb receptor tyrosine kinases  <cit> .

ehd <dig> has been ascribed two distinct roles in regulating the exit of traffic from the ees to both the erc  <cit>  and the golgi  <cit> . ehd <dig> depletion led to fragmentation of the golgi  <cit> . although less studied, ehd <dig> has been ascribed a role in endocytosis  <cit> , nucleotide-dependent membrane remodeling  <cit>  and fusion of myoblasts  <cit> .

to date, studies of the ehd protein family have largely focused on their role in trafficking transferrin and receptors using in vitro assays. in contrast to in vitro studies implicating mammalian ehd proteins in the regulation of endocytic recycling, the only evidence for their in vivo roles is by analogy to rme- <dig> in c. elegans and past <dig> in drosophila. direct evidence for an in vivo function of ehd proteins in mammalian systems is presently lacking. analyses of the expression of ehd paralogs in different mouse tissues are consistent with the likelihood that different ehd proteins may have tissue-specific as well as more redundant roles  <cit> . early studies highlighted the relatively high ehd <dig> mrna and protein expression in mouse testis , kidney, heart, intestine and brain  <cit> . in the same study, immunohistochemistry revealed ehd <dig> protein expression in elongated spermatids in the testis, adipocytes, lung, heart and specific retinal layers in mice  <cit> . ehd <dig> has also been found in exosome-like vesicles purified from the cauda epididymal fluid of rams  <cit> . contrary to expectations based on a relatively high expression in certain organs, targeted deletion of the ehd <dig> c-terminal region in mice did not produce an overt phenotype  <cit> . given the plethora of in vitro cell biological studies supporting a role for mammalian ehd <dig>  we used a different targeting strategy to generate an ehd <dig> knockout mouse that completely lacks ehd <dig> expression and assessed whether the loss of ehd <dig> had any demonstrable impact on adult organ function. in contrast to previous results  <cit> , we report that ehd1-null mice survive at sub-mendelian ratios in several mouse strains, display reduced growth as compared to wildtype  mice and ehd1-/- males are infertile. we conclude that the endocytic recycling regulator ehd <dig> plays an important role in mouse development and is essential for male fertility. to our knowledge, this is the first knockout mouse model of male infertility due to the loss of a single protein implicated in endocytic recycling.

RESULTS
generation of ehd1-deficient mice
ehd1-deficient mice were generated using a recombineering strategy as described in methods . pcr analysis of tail dna confirmed the ehd <dig> gene was correctly targeted in heterozygous deleted , homozygous deleted , heterozygous floxed , and homozygous floxed  mice . rt-pcr also confirmed the absence of ehd <dig> mrna in the testis of ehd1-/- male mice .

previously, we showed that ehd proteins were expressed in several mouse organs in both male and female mice  <cit> . western blots performed on lysates of mouse organs obtained from wt, ehd1+/- and ehd1-/- mice confirmed that disruption of ehd <dig> led to a loss of ehd <dig> protein expression in ehd1-/- male  as well as female mice . intermediate levels of ehd <dig> were seen in the lung, kidney, heart, spleen, and testis of ehd1+/- mice when compared to wt and ehd1-/- mice . these results demonstrated that the targeting strategy led to complete loss of ehd <dig> expression in ehd1-/- mouse tissues.

deletion of ehd <dig> in different mouse strains results in partial lethality
crosses of ehd1+/- mice on a 129;b <dig> mixed background did not produce the expected mendelian ratio of ehd1-/- mice  . these results indicated that loss of ehd <dig> was partially lethal. similar results were seen after seven backcrosses  to the fvb/nj strain . the 129;b <dig> mixed strain was used in further analyses unless specified.

n denotes the number of breeding pairs; * - some breeding pairs produced multiple litters. % was calculated for each genotype based on total pups for each breeding scheme. ehd1-/- males were bred for two months with two females each.

the progeny from crosses of ehd1+/- mice were 49% female and 51% male with twice as many ehd1+/- as compared to wt mice, indicating normal gender ratios and a lack of lethality when one copy of ehd <dig> was present. a separate study was conducted where the genotype of pups that died from unknown causes between post-natal days  <dig> and  <dig> were examined. interestingly,  <dig> of  <dig> pups  were ehd1-/- mice, indicating a disproportionately higher frequency  of death among ehd1-/- mice at or near birth.

ehd1-/- mice are smaller than wt mice and display developmental defects
ehd1-/- mice that survived early neonatal lethality were smaller than wt and ehd1+/- littermates from birth  to adulthood . both male and female mice showed lower weights as compared to controls . in several cases, ehd1-/- females displayed malocclusion  which required bi-weekly incisor trimming into adulthood to prevent death. a few animals were euthanized due to abnormally small size and malnutrition at age 3- <dig> weeks independent of incisor problems and several others perished around this time due to unknown causes. a substantial proportion of the surviving ehd1-/- animals displayed gross ocular defects  including anophthalmia , microphthalmia , and congenital central cataracts. the nature of eye developmental defects in ehd1-/- mice is being pursued separately.

ehd1-/- male mice are infertile
despite our repeated attempts to mate ehd1-/- mice, no progeny were generated indicating the lack of fertility of either one or both genders. breeding ehd1+/- males with ehd1-/- females gave rise to healthy pups ; only 29%  of the mice that survived to weaning age were ehd1-/-. for unknown reasons, the percentage of ehd1-/- mice surviving to weaning age compared to mendelian predictions were higher when raised by an ehd1-/- dam versus an ehd1+/- dam. these results further documented that ehd1-/- females were fertile and the partial lethality in ehd1-null mice .

to test if ehd1-/- males were fertile, 8-week old males were housed with two virgin adult females each. despite normal mating behavior, as determined by their ability to mount females and give rise to a copulatory plug, no ehd1-/- male mice were capable of siring offspring, indicating that ehd1-/- males were infertile . females used in these experiments were proven competent at being impregnated by other fertile males after initial breeding with ehd1-/- males. the ability of eight ehd1fl-neo/fl-neo breeding pairs to successfully produce progeny provided evidence that the presence of loxp sites in the targeted ehd <dig> gene did not cause defects in fertility or overall survival by influencing an untargeted gene.

previously, a c-terminal deletion of ehd <dig> in mice was shown to have no effects in viability, growth or fertility in 129/svev or swiss webster strains  <cit> . to determine whether fertility defects in the ehd1-/- male mice were influenced by genetic background, we crossed ehd1+/- mice two times into the fvb/nj strain  and then generated ehd1-/- mice. the resulting ehd1-/- male mice were infertile while ehd1-/- female mice were fertile . further backcrossing revealed that ehd1-/- male fvb/nj strain  mice were also infertile , indicating that loss of ehd <dig> leads to complete infertility in male mice irrespective of strain.

adult ehd1-/- male mice exhibit small testes
the raw weights of testes, spleen and kidneys of ehd1-/- male mice at post-natal day  <dig> and  <dig> were not statistically different from wt mice . however, from day  <dig>  the testes in ehd1-/- mice were smaller than that of wt mice indicating the first delay in testes development as determined by weight . interestingly, the androgen-dependent seminal vesicles were comparable in size between wt, ehd1+/- and ehd1-/- mice  suggesting that hormone levels were unaffected. serum testosterone levels of mice were variable; however, levels in ehd1-/- mice were within a range comparable to those of wt and ehd1+/- adult mice . the small testis size phenotype was similar in n <dig> and n <dig> fvb/nj mice .

organs were dissected from euthanized mice and weighed. the testes weight represents both testis dissected from the scrotal sac, the seminiferous tubule widths  were measured using imagej software http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/ to measure the smallest width of circular seminiferous tubules across the lumen from light microscopy photographs of pas-stained bouin's-fixed testis sections. the kidney weight represents both kidneys . the uncorrected seminal vesicle weights of 61- <dig> week old mice: wt =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg and ehd1-/- =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg . statistical analysis comparing the raw data of each age-matched values between wt and ehd1-/- mice was determined using a two-sample t-test .

ehd <dig> expression in post-natal mouse testis development
to assess the ehd <dig> mrna expression, in situ hybridizations were carried out in developing mouse testes. ehd <dig> mrna was expressed in most cells of the seminiferous epithelia  including sertoli cells .

to assess the ehd protein expression at early stages of testis development, a western blot was performed . ehd <dig>  ehd <dig> and ehd <dig> were expressed in wt testis at days 10- <dig> while ehd <dig> levels were relatively low. interestingly, ehd1-/- testes displayed an increase in ehd <dig>  ehd <dig> and ehd <dig> expression at day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  ehd <dig>  ehd <dig> and ehd <dig> were also expressed in an immortalized mouse sertoli cell line  as analyzed by western blot .

to determine ehd <dig> localization within the testis, immunohistochemistry was performed and revealed ehd <dig> expression in most cells of the seminiferous epithelium. at post-natal day  <dig>  ehd <dig> was expressed in the cytoplasm of both spermatogonia  and sertoli cells  at the basement membrane with higher signals near the lateral and apical surfaces of these cells . ehd <dig> expression was also seen around the nucleus of spermatogonia  towards the lumen of seminiferous tubules . as expected, ehd <dig> expression was absent in ehd1-/- testis . at day  <dig>  ehd <dig> was localized in the cytoplasm of sertoli cells and spermatogonia near the base of seminiferous tubules. in addition, ehd <dig> was expressed in pachytene spermatocytes, and round and elongated spermatids . similar patterns were observed in adult wt testis .

ehd1-/- mice show a range of abnormalities in spermatogenesis
during spermatogenesis, spermatogonia undergo mitotic divisions and differentiate into spermatocytes. spermatocytes undergo two meiotic divisions, differentiate to round spermatids that later form elongated spermatids and are released from sertoli cells during spermiation. progression of spermatogenesis is described using histology of seminiferous tubule cross-sections in stages  that define the morphological development of germ cells as a group  <cit> . the morphology of an individual spermatid in spermiogenesis is described as a step that is most easily followed by periodic acid-schiff -stained acrosome formation and shape, or less easily by assessing chromatin condensation and spermatid head shape  <cit> . in order to discern initial lesions in spermatogenesis, we carried out histological analyses of testes in  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> day old mice. at each age, the average width of seminiferous tubules was comparable between wt and ehd1-/- mice indicating that lumen formation by the seminiferous epithelia was unaffected in the absence of ehd <dig> .

at post-natal day  <dig>  the wt seminiferous tubules predominantly contained sertoli cells and some pachytene spermatocytes, the most advanced germ cell type seen at this age . spermatogonia were present near the basement membrane and few apoptotic features were seen   <cit> . ehd1-/- seminiferous tubules were similar in appearance, also displaying some apoptotic features in the lumen and near the basement membrane . there appeared to be a delay in the normal maturation of spermatogonia and pachytene spermatocytes in ehd1-/- as compared to wt mice as analyzed by chromatin condensation and cell size. in addition, some ehd1-/- seminiferous tubules contained a greater number of apoptotic-like dense bodies than wt. however, no major lesions were detected in the seminiferous tubules of ehd1-/- mice at day  <dig> 

at day  <dig>  normal spermatogenesis was apparent in wt mice with well-organized germ cells typical of the first wave of spermatogenesis. in general, sertoli cells were near the basement membrane while elongated spermatids lined the lumen  and normal meiosis was observed in spermatocytes . round spermatids displayed a round/ovoid appearance until stage ix when the spermatid head formed a dorsal and ventral surface with the acrosome primarily on the dorsal surface of step  <dig> spermatids . in contrast, ehd1-/- seminiferous tubules showed abnormal cells in meiosis  and elongated spermatids that displayed abnormal orientation, shape and chromatin condensation . some ehd1-/- seminiferous tubules displayed a sertoli cell only phenotype not seen in the wt  indicating a complete lack of germ cells. interestingly, a delay in the maturation of elongated spermatids was observed with a mixture of spermatids  present in a seminiferous tubule cross-section . in wt mice, the pas-positive acrosomal cap of round spermatids covered more than one third of the nucleus at stage vii with a central acrosomal granule . however, in ehd1-/- mice, the acrosomal caps appeared abnormal with asymmetric formations  and punctate appearances . neither the ehd1-/- nor the wt epididymides contained spermatozoa at day  <dig>  confirming that these animals were in the initial waves of spermatogenesis. since round spermatids form prior to day  <dig> , there may be lesions that were not elucidated in the current study.

at day  <dig>  the epididymides in wt mice contained mature spermatozoa whereas ehd1-/- mice lacked sperm ; this defect continued into adulthood. to gain further insights into abnormal spermatogenesis, we carried out a detailed examination of  <dig> day old wt and ehd1-/- mouse testes. wt mice displayed normal spermatogenesis where a single step of round and elongated spermatids were supported by sertoli cells in an evenly spaced and orderly fashion in seminiferous tubule cross-sections . on the other hand, spermatogenesis only appeared normal prior to acrosome formation in ehd1-/- mice. several ehd1-/- seminiferous tubule cross-sections exhibited a mixture of elongated spermatids  as well as misaligned elongated spermatids near the basement membrane, suggesting sertoli cell phagocytosis of step  <dig> spermatids that failed to be released . in late stage viii, failure of spermiation and clumping of spermatid heads was observed in addition to fusion of large aggregates of residual bodies and cytoplasmic lobes that contained clumped spermatids . in stage x, clumping of step  <dig> spermatids was observed in membranous wheels and near the basement membrane . step  <dig> spermatids were also observed with their heads and tails fused; their cytoplasm failed to form cytoplasmic lobes and residual bodies which are normally reabsorbed by sertoli cells . ehd1-/- testis also showed abnormal step  <dig> spermatids . thus, our results demonstrate clear spermatogenesis and spermiation defects in ehd1-null testes.

to further characterize the defects in spermatogenesis in ehd1-/- mice at the ultrastructural level, transmission electron microscopy analyses were carried out on thin sections of the testis. in stage viii of wt testis , elongated spermatids were found near the lumen or in the lumen after spermiation . elongated spermatids that had not spermiated maintained an apical ectoplasmic specialization in contact with wt sertoli cells . however, in late stage viii of ehd1-/- testis , elongated spermatids appeared in phagocytic, membranous wheels . upon closer examination, the phagocytic wheel was encased by ectoplasmic specializations and contained the nuclei, acrosomes and tails of elongated spermatids . since proper function of the sertoli cells requires constant endocytic trafficking  <cit> , we surmise that ehd1-dependent endocytic recycling and trafficking may be required for spermiation in mice.

discussion
an earlier report of an ehd <dig> knockout mouse indicated no overt biological phenotype  <cit>  which was surprising given the in vitro cell biological evidence that supports the critical roles of ehd proteins in endocytic recycling. here, we show that mice that completely lack ehd <dig> expression exhibit multiple overt phenotypes, consistent with a critical role of ehd <dig> during pre- and post-natal development and organ function. while reduction of ehd <dig> in adult ehd1+/- mice was without detectable biological phenotypes, ehd1-/- mice survived at sub-mendelian ratios and exhibited reduced body size. ehd1-/- mice also showed higher early post-natal mortality and exhibited two dramatic organ-specific phenotypes: marked abnormalities in eye development  and male infertility .

spermatogenesis is a complex process in which diploid spermatogonia develop into mature haploid spermatozoa capable of fertilizing an ovum. in the testis, somatic sertoli cells nurse as many as ~30- <dig> developing germ cells  <cit> . during maturation, developing spermatids remain attached to sertoli cells through specialized membrane structures. the final junction between spermatozoa and the sertoli cell is an actin-based testis-specific adherens junction termed the apical ectoplasmic specialization that forms in late stage vii and early stage viii of spermatogenesis  <cit> . spermiation occurs at late stage viii when polarized spermatozoa are released from sertoli cells and enter the lumen.

the observed defects in spermatogenesis in ehd1-/- male mice can explain their infertility. first, mature spermatozoa are not found in the epididymides of ehd1-/- males. second, this is a direct result of the failure of spermiation. third, spermiation failure can be explained by abnormal clumping of elongated spermatids in membranous wheels followed by phagocytosis by sertoli cells in stages viii-x. fourth, a delay in the progression of spermatogenesis results in a mixture of spermatid steps. fifth, abnormal formation of the acrosomal granule and cap of round spermatids was the earliest lesion observed. since only minor abnormalities were detected in day  <dig> testes, these results implicate ehd <dig> in pre-pubertal development of the testis and suggest that potential ehd1-dependent endocytic recycling mechanisms in the haploid phase of spermatogenesis may be required for normal acrosome development and spermiation. ultrastructural analyses of ehd1-/- mouse testes further support these data.

abnormal spermatogenesis and male sterility in ehd1-/- mice indicate that either ehd <dig>  ehd <dig> and ehd <dig>  are insufficient to compensate for the loss of ehd <dig> or that ehd <dig> is uniquely important. recent immunohistochemical analysis suggested that ehd <dig> is particularly highly expressed in elongated spermatids  <cit>  while our data suggests that sertoli cells and spermatogonia also express ehd <dig> . western blot analyses of an immortalized mouse sertoli cell line also indicated that ehd <dig>  ehd <dig> and ehd <dig> proteins are expressed in sertoli cells  with lower/undetectable levels of ehd <dig>  availability of knockout models lacking the expression of the other ehd family members  should help to unravel the redundant versus unique ehd <dig> functions in spermatogenesis. analyses of ehd4-null mice, in which both males and females are fertile but male testis sizes are ~50% smaller than wt mice at day  <dig>  indicate that ehd <dig> is required for mice to attain normal pre-pubertal testis size but is dispensable for male fertility .

how might the loss of endocytic recycling regulator ehd <dig> lead to a block in spermatogenesis and spermiation? the data described here indicate defects in spermiogenesis, a process where major restructuring of spermatids occurs after the blood-testis barrier has formed at the tight junctions of sertoli cells. germ cell differentiation is coordinated by sertoli cells and the ectoplasmic specializations formed between sertoli and maturing germ cells in the adult animal. once established, these sertoli-germ cell complexes move with germ cells until spermiation occurs  <cit> . in ehd1-/- mice, the acrosomal cap that associates with the junctional complexes appear to develop abnormally. this could affect the ability of sertoli cells to regulate germ cell migration and thus result in clumping of spermatids and failure of release. ehd <dig> expression in germ cells and sertoli cells indicate the abnormalities observed could arise from defects in either cell type or both.

endocytosis and recycling of integral membrane proteins has recently emerged as an important regulator of spermatogenesis  <cit> . since ehd proteins are known to regulate endocytic recycling in other systems, we hypothesize a role for ehd <dig> in endocytic recycling during spermatogenesis. synchronous regulation of the actin-based ectoplasmic specializations and components of the blood-testis barrier  co-ordinate spermatogenesis  <cit> ; in addition, these dynamic structures are regulated by hormones, growth factors and cytokines to precisely control the timing of the passage of developing germ cells via endocytic recycling mechanisms  <cit> . indeed, cytokines implicated in transient physiological opening of the blood-testis barrier have been shown to induce the internalization of sertoli cell junctional proteins  <cit> . notably, il- <dig>  a cytokine implicated in the regulation of sertoli-sertoli cell junctions  <cit> , has been shown to up-regulate the expression of ehd <dig> mrna in other model cell systems  <cit> . how sertoli cell and/or germ cell membrane proteins involved in regulating ectoplasmic specializations are recycled back to the cell membrane is completely unknown. in this context, detailed future studies of the trafficking of gap junction-, tight junction- and adherens junction-associated proteins in the wt and ehd1-/- testis as germ cells migrate from the basement membrane into the adluminal compartment should provide a better understanding of ehd1-regulated processes during spermatogenesis. analyses of sertoli-sertoli and sertoli-germ cell interactions in vitro combined with sertoli vs. germ cell-specific ehd <dig> knockout should further help test these models and ascertain the biochemical and cell biological processes in spermatogenesis that are under ehd <dig> regulation.

what might lead to the small testes phenotype in the ehd1-/- mice? since elongated spermatids are phagocytosed rather than spermiated in the ehd1-/- testes, there are less germ cells in the seminiferous epithelium. the presence of sertoli cell-only seminiferous tubules in the ehd1-/- testes indicates that progressive loss of germ cells might occur and we have observed enhanced apoptosis in the ehd1-/- testes . since the majority of adult testis weight is due to the presence of germ cells in the seminiferous epithelium  <cit> , germ cell depletion due to phagocytosis, defects in differentiation or increased apoptosis could be responsible for the small testis phenotype.

at present, the developmental defects and growth retardation seen in ehd1-/- mice is under investigation. our results contrast with the lack of observable phenotypes in the ehd <dig> knockout mice previously described  <cit> . the differences in strains  or the strategies used to delete ehd <dig>  could have led to the differences observed. whether the lack of a phenotype of ehd <dig> deletion in the previous studies was a result of full compensation by other ehd proteins or due to expression of a truncated but functional ehd <dig> is not known. an increase in the expression of other ehd proteins is seen in the day 30- <dig> ehd1-/- testes described here , yet the presence of fertility defects in the ehd1-/- mice indicate that this does not compensate for loss of ehd <dig>  in order to ensure that n-terminally-truncated in-frame fragments of ehd <dig> were not present in ehd1-/- mice, western blots of organ lysates were probed with an ehd <dig> antibody that was raised against the c-terminal region. as expected, we did not observe the ~ <dig> kd full length ehd <dig> in ehd1-/- mouse organs including the testis . rt-pcr with two primer sets specific to the c-terminal region of ehd <dig> showed no amplification of products using mrna isolated from ehd1-/- mouse testes when compared to expected products with wt testes . furthermore, ehd1fl-neo/fl-neo mice with loxp sites flanking the first exon of ehd <dig> were normal with respect to development, growth and fertility. these results indicate that specific loss of ehd1expression is responsible for the defects described.

CONCLUSIONS
our analyses using an ehd1-/- mouse model with complete loss of ehd <dig> expression demonstrates an important role of this novel regulator of endocytic recycling in mammalian development with a critical functional role in spermatogenesis. this model provides a basis for further studies to explore the physiological targets of ehd <dig> and the biological processes regulated by this protein as well as to explore how endocytic recycling controls spermatogenesis. thus our results indicate for the first time, a crucial role of an endocytic recycling regulatory protein ehd <dig> in spermatogenesis and provide the first evidence of a critical in vivo biological function of a mammalian ehd protein family member.
