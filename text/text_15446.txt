BACKGROUND
the central dogma of molecular biology describes how the genetic information encoded in dna is used to make proteins. although rnas were long known to play crucial roles in this process , their importance in gene expression control has dramatically expanded with the recent discovery of rna interference   <cit> . in the simplest terms, rnai refers to sequence-specific gene silencing occurring after mrna transcription, and the principal regulators of this process are small, non-coding micrornas   <cit> .

natural mirnas are encoded in the genomes of eukaryotes and some viruses  <cit> . over  <dig>  mirnas were identified in recent years, and the major steps and players involved in mirna biogenesis have been largely defined  <cit> . this knowledge provided the foundation for developing expression systems to deliver engineered inhibitory rnas, like shrnas and artificial mirnas, to various cells and tissues in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . in essence, these vectors operate as sirna or mature mirna delivery vehicles; as there is not universal nomenclature for such systems, we note that they are referred to as "artificial mirna shuttles" in this manuscript. importantly, these artificial mirna shuttles can be engineered to knockdown any gene of interest  <cit> . as a result, they have emerged as powerful molecular tools for querying natural mirna function, delivering inhibitory rnas for functional genomics studies, or developing rnai-based therapies for disease  <cit> . indeed, several pre-clinical studies support that rnai-based therapies are promising approaches for treating dominant genetic diseases, viral pathogens, and cancer  <cit> .

our laboratory is interested in developing rnai therapies for dominantly inherited disorders  <cit> . this work requires delivering artificial therapeutic mirna shuttles to target cells and tissues. numerous groups, including ours, have described various expression vectors in recent years  <cit> . the most commonly used systems rely upon constitutively active promoters, such as u <dig>  to drive inhibitory rna transcription. these vectors are typically constructed using traditional cut-and-paste molecular cloning techniques, and multiple constructs are often required to identify ones capable of effectively silencing target genes  <cit> . to streamline the construction process and make it less labor-intensive, we developed a procedure to rapidly generate artificial mirna expression vectors using a commercially available phage recombinase system . in so doing, we also created a method that provides tightly controlled, inducible mirna expression, and a built-in mechanism to destroy the vector, if desired. we named our method the gateway®-ready inducible mirna  expression system . in this manuscript, we describe a detailed protocol for grim vector construction and demonstrate the functionality of our system in mammalian cells.

methods
grim destination vector construction
the grim destination vector was constructed by recombinant pcr from two products. the first product contained the mouse u <dig> promoter flanked by single frt and loxp sites at the 5' and 3' ends, respectively. in addition,  <dig> nucleotides corresponding to the 5' portion of the attp <dig> site were added downstream of loxp . product a primers were:  <dig> forward  and  <dig> reverse . the second product  was the gateway® cassette, containing the ccdb and chloramphenicol resistance  genes flanked by attp <dig> and attp <dig> sites, which was amplified from pdonr <dig>  this cassette was also engineered to contain  <dig> nucleotides of a loxp site at the 5' end. product b primers were:  <dig> forward  and  <dig> reverse . products a and b were then stitched together by  <dig> cycles of recombinant pcr using the overlapping loxp and attp <dig> sequences, followed by  <dig> cycles of exponential amplification using primers  <dig> and  <dig>  the resultant  <dig>  bp pcr product was gel purified, cloned into pcr®-blunt ii-topo , transformed into one shot® ccdb survival™ competent cells , and plated onto lb agar plates containing chloramphenicol. minipreps from restriction positive colonies were sequenced to confirm accuracy.

linear mirna donor construction
the  <dig> bp linear mirna donor sequences were constructed from  <dig> primers, two of which are common to all constructs, and two that are unique to the cloned mirna sequences. this strategy is described in the results section and primer sequences detailed in additional file  <dig>  for this study, we built grim vectors containing two different microrna sequences  targeting lacz and egfp reporters, respectively . for mirna donor construction, one microgram of each primer was mixed together in a  <dig> microliter reaction with pfx polymerase  and thermocycled using the following conditions: 95°c ×  <dig> sec, 45°×  <dig> sec, and 68°c ×  <dig> sec for  <dig> cycles. full-length mirna donor bands were visualized on ethidium bromide stained agarose/tbe gels  to ensure primer extension. however, we found that gel or column purification was unnecessary for bp cloning into the grim destination vector.

bp recombination reaction and clone verification
three microliters of the 50-microliter mirna donor reaction was combined with  <dig> ng of the gateway® destination vector, and this dna mixture was then added to a  <dig> microliter, room temperature bp clonase reaction  for  <dig> hour using manufacturer's instructions. bp clonase was inactivated with proteinase k, following manufacturer's instructions, and  <dig> microliters of the bp reaction was transformed into chemically competent, ccdb sensitive top <dig> e. coli cells . colonies were selected on lb agar plates containing kanamycin. resistant colonies were dna miniprepped  and digested with ecori , and electrophoresed on a 1% agarose/tbe/ethidium bromide gel to determine clone correctness . correctly recombined clones  show two ecori bands of  <dig>  and  <dig> bp, while the empty grim destination vector has three ecori fragments of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> bp . bp recombination had a 90% efficiency for both the milacz and migfp constructs. restriction positive colonies were dna sequenced  using a primer located at the 3' end of the u <dig> promoter .

generating grim.mirnaon vectors in e. coli
grim.mirnaoff vectors can be permanently switched on by transformation into el <dig> e. coli cells, which express cre recombinase from the arabinose-inducible promoter  <cit> . cre recombinase was induced by l--arabinose prior to making cells electrocompetent. cre+ el <dig> cells were then transformed with  <dig> ng grim.mirnaoff plasmid, and grown overnight at 32°c on lb agar plates containing kanamycin. resistant colonies were seeded into miniprep cultures, and agitated overnight in lb/kanamycin liquid media at 32°c. following dna miniprep, floxed clones were identified by ecori digestion and electrophoresis. positive grim.mirnaon colonies show two ecori bands at  <dig>  and  <dig> bp, compared to  <dig>  and  <dig> bp from unfloxed grim.mirnaoff vectors . in our experiments, cre excision was 100% efficient in el <dig> cells.

transient gene silencing studies
grim.migfp
hek <dig> cells were co-transfected  with  <dig> ng of a cmv.egfp expression vector  <cit>  and  <dig> ng indicated mirna expression plasmid  in duplicate on  <dig> well plates. gfp epifluorescence was imaged using a fluorescent inverted microscope equipped with a digital camera  <dig> hours later.

grim.milacz. hek <dig> cells were co-transfected with  <dig> ng cmv.βgal expression plasmid and  <dig> ng of the indicated mirna expression constructs  in triplicate on  <dig> well plates with white walls and clear bottoms. the next day, cells were lysed for  <dig> minutes using  <dig> microliters of galacto-light™ kit lysis buffer . one microliter of lysate was used to quantify total protein by lowry assay . β-galactosidase activity was then measured from the remaining  <dig> microliters of lysate following manufacturer's instructions. triplicate data were averaged per condition, and three independent experiments performed. β-galactosidase activity was normalized to lowry assay-determined protein content.

grim.milacz with flp/frt system
hek <dig> cells were co-transfected with  <dig> ng cmv.βgal and indicated plasmids . where indicated, cells received  <dig> ng cmv.cre,  <dig> ng grim.milaczoff, and/or  <dig> ng cmv.flp recombinase. βgal activity was measured as described above. all wells received equivalent molar amounts of plasmid, such that an empty u <dig> plasmid was used to normalize dna loading in transfection liposomes, when necessary.

northern blot
four micrograms of indicated grim.milacz and control plasmids were transfected into hek <dig> cells on  <dig> well plates. one day later, total rna was extracted using the mirvana kit . five micrograms of total rna per well was loaded on an urea/polyacrylamide/tbe gel, along with dna oligonucleotides containing antisense  or sense  milacz sequences, as previously described  <cit> . the gel was run at  <dig> ma until bromophenol blue dye reached the bottom, then separated rnas were transferred to nylon membranes  at  <dig> ma for  <dig> minutes in  <dig> × tbe. membranes were then cross-linked and hybridized with a 32p end-labelled dna oligo  that detected the antisense guide strand of the milacz sequence, in oligo hyb buffer  for two days at 36°c. the membrane was then washed three times at room temperature and twice at 36°c in 2× ssc, exposed to autoradiographic film  at -80°c, and developed  <dig> days later.

generation of stable hek <dig> cells
hek <dig> cells were transfected  with a 1: <dig> molar ratio of cmv.βgal and pgk.neo plasmids in a  <dig> mm plate. two days later,  <dig> μg/ml g <dig> was added to tissue culture media  and cells were passaged and selected for  <dig> weeks. g <dig> resistant cells were then plated at low density,  <dig> different single colonies were picked and expanded, and representative cells from each colony were stained for β-gal activity  using manufacturer's instructions. six of  <dig> colonies were βgal positive, and we ultimately selected a line that had consistent βgal expression in all cells. this line was then co-transfected  in a 12-well plate with  <dig> ng grim.milaczoff and  <dig> ng of a cag.puromycin resistance  plasmid. two days later, we began selection in puromycin  for one month, and then pcr screened resistant cells for grim.milaczoff presence.

validation of the flp/frt system in stable hek293/βgal cells
puror/g418r stable hek293/βgal/grim.milaczoff cells were transiently transfected with a cmv.cre expression plasmid , and βgal activity was determined in the parent and floxed stable cells  <dig> days later, to ensure grim.milacz-mediated βgal knockdown. four weeks later, floxed grim.milaczon cells were transfected with the pog <dig> cmv.flp expression plasmid . βgal activity was then measured  <dig> days later using the galacto-light™ kit lysis buffer , as described above. data are representative of  <dig> independent experiments.

RESULTS
construction of grim vectors: overview
any inhibitory rna sequence can be cloned into the grim vector system using our universal strategy. a general overview of this method is shown in figure  <dig> and the detailed protocol is described in additional files  <dig>  and  <dig>  the initial cloning reaction requires three major components: the grim destination vector, a linear mirna donor, and bp clonase™ enzyme, derived from lambda phage recombinases .

the grim destination vector contains the rna polymerase iii-dependent mouse u <dig> promoter cloned upstream of a gateway® selection cassette. single frt and loxp sites, which are substrates for flp and cre recombinases, respectively, flank the u <dig> promoter at its 5' and 3' ends .

in our system, the linear mirna donor is based on sequences and structures derived from human mir-30a   <cit> . we build the mirna donor by annealing  <dig> dna primers and filling in gaps with a thermostable dna polymerase, such as taq or pfx. the two outside primers  are universal for building all linear mirna donors, while the two internal ones  provide the unique mirna sequences designed by the end user . common primer  <dig> contains a terminal attb <dig> site followed by a loxp site and  <dig> nucleotides derived from the lower stem of human mir-30a . common primer  <dig> is a minus strand oligonucleotide encoding a terminal attb <dig> site, an optional frt site,  <dig> nucleotides of the human mir-30a lower stem, and a rna polymerase iii termination signal . in addition to encoding the unique mirna sense and antisense sequences, the internal mirna primers  <dig> and  <dig> also contain human mir-30a stem and loop sequences, which provide common complementary regions for primer annealing. the primer design and annealing strategy is detailed in additional file  <dig>  in addition, we developed a software package that automates the grim.mirna shuttle prediction and design process .

extending the two common and two mirna-specific primers produces a full-length  <dig> bp linear mirna donor dna , which is then used in a bp recombination reaction with the grim destination vector . smaller, incompletely extended products are also generated but lack full-length attb sites and are therefore incapable of participating in the bp reaction . as a result, gel purification of the full-length linear mirna donor dna is unnecessary .

the parent grim destination vector is kanamycin resistant  and contains an active ccdb  gene in the gateway® cassette region. ccdb gene expression is lethal to most transformation-competent e. coli used in laboratories for molecular cloning purposes. bp recombination replaces the ccdb-containing gateway® cassette with the linear mirna donor dna. this reaction also converts attb and attp sites to a  <dig> bp hybrid sequence called attl . thus, ccdb-sensitive cells will only grow when transformed with properly recombined plasmids, which we termed grim.mirnaoff vectors.

grim.mirnaoff plasmids have kanr and contain a loxp-flanked attl <dig> site located between the mouse u <dig> promoter and the artificial mirna shuttle sequence . this entire cassette is enclosed at both ends by frt sites. the attl <dig> site inhibits mirna production, thereby conferring inducibility to the system. mature, functional mirnas are therefore only produced after the attl <dig> site is excised  by cre recombinase, yielding grim.mirnaon vectors . alternatively, to rapidly generate un-inducible mirna vectors, grim.mirnaoff vectors can be transformed into el <dig> e. coli, which express arabinose-inducible cre recombinase . finally, the flanking frt sites permit irreversible grim.mirnaon shutdown in the presence of flp recombinase .

grim.mirnaoff vectors are turned 'on' by cre recombinase
to demonstrate the functionality of our system, we developed two different mirna donors targeting the e. coli lacz and a. victoria enhanced gfp  genes, respectively . we called these sequences grim.milacz and grim.migfp. we first tested the gene-silencing efficacy of each construct relative to a comparable u <dig> mirna vector prepared using conventional cut-and-paste cloning techniques . to do this, we co-transfected hek <dig> cells with a cmv.egfp expression plasmid and u <dig> migfp, an empty u <dig> vector, grim.migfpoff, or grim.migfpon constructs. fluorescent microscopic imaging  <dig> hours later revealed distinctly less gfp expression in cells transfected with the u <dig> migfp and grim.migfpon vectors compared to the empty u <dig> control. in contrast, gfp levels were comparably higher and more widespread in cells expressing the grim.migfpoff plasmid .

to better quantify gene silencing and confirm that the functionality of our system was not restricted to the migfp sequence alone, we performed a second gene silencing experiment using lacz-directed mirnas  and a β-galactosidase  reporter assay. specifically, we transiently co-transfected hek <dig> cells with a cmv.lacz plasmid and conventional u <dig> or grim-driven milacz and control expression vectors . one day later, we determined milacz-directed gene silencing by measuring β-gal activity in transfected cells. we found that cells expressing u <dig> milacz and its grim.milaczon counterpart had a statistically significant 60% reduction in β-gal activity compared to all other controls . in contrast, the grim.milaczoff plasmid had no impact on β-gal levels .

our gene silencing results using both gfp and lacz reporter assays suggested that the unfloxed grim.milaczoff vectors were incapable of producing mature, functional milacz sequences. to determine this, we performed small transcript northern blots using rna isolated from hek <dig> cells transfected with empty u <dig> vector, u <dig> milacz, and the floxed and unfloxed grim.milacz constructs. the original u <dig> mirna cassettes and their grim.mirnaon counterparts are identical sequences except the grim vectors contain a single loxp at the 5' end of the mirna shuttle transcript, and are therefore  <dig> nt longer . using a radiolabeled probe targeting the milacz antisense strand, we detected identical pre-milacz and mature milacz species in u <dig> milacz and grim.milaczon samples, but not in the empty u <dig> control or, importantly, the grim.milaczoff lanes . moreover, the grim.milaczon sample had an additional, larger band that migrated at the expected location of the loxp-containing primary grim transcript . these results demonstrated that grim vectors are tightly regulated by cre recombinase.

grim.mirna vectors can be turned 'off' by flp recombinase
in some cases, it may be desirable to shutdown mirna expression. for example, over-expressed inhibitory rnas can sometimes cause unintended, non-specific off-target effects that could be detrimental to the host cell  <cit> . alternatively, strategies for querying normal mirna function could include measuring specific outcomes in mirna-expressing cells and then determining how these outcomes change when the mirna is turned off. we therefore built a mechanism into the grim system to permanently remove the frt-flanked mirna expression cassette with flp recombinase .

we hypothesized that the optimal method to demonstrate off-switch functionality was to reverse, rather than prevent, grim.milacz-mediated βgal gene silencing. this strategy required turning 'on' the grim.milaczoff vector and allowing sufficient time for βgal reduction before shutting down the system with flp. we hypothesized that this could not be accomplished in the 2- <dig> day time window provided by a transient transfection experiment. we therefore generated stable hek <dig> cell lines expressing g418-selected cmv.lacz and puromycin-selected grim.milaczoff plasmids. after selection, we transfected hek <dig> stables with cmv.cre, cultured cells for several weeks, transfected again with cmv.flp, and then harvested cells for βgal assays. as expected cre-treated cells  had significantly reduced βgal activity compared to hek <dig> stables expressing grim.milaczoff. importantly, transient flp recombinase expression significantly reversed grim.milaczon gene silencing . these results confirmed that the grim system could be inactivated by flp recombinase.

discussion
numerous inhibitory rna expression vectors have been described in recent years  <cit> . first-generation vector systems typically relied upon constitutively active, rna polymerase iii-dependent  promoters, such as h <dig> or u <dig>  to drive uncontrolled inhibitory rna expression  <cit> . as the applicability of rnai as a technology became more apparent, additional expression strategies emerged, including embedding mirnas into introns or 3' utrs of translated genes, and using constitutively active or tissue-specific rna polymerase ii-dependent  promoters to direct transcription  <cit> . to achieve even greater control of inhibitory rna expression, several groups developed doxycycline- or cre recombinase-inducible shrna/mirna systems  <cit> . these inducible vectors have proven useful for studying normal mirna function, functional genomics, and may also have potential therapeutic applications, by providing fail-safe mechanisms to shut down inhibitory rna expression if unintended off-target effects arise.

despite the diversity of expression strategies currently available, virtually all share the common feature that construction requires cut-and-paste molecular techniques, which can be tedious and time-consuming. in addition, developing optimal artificial inhibitory rnas, such as for therapeutic purposes, often requires building and screening numerous constructs, which adds to the hands-on time needed to ultimately identify the best sequences  <cit> . thus, our initial goal for engineering the grim system was to simply streamline the construction process by using a procedure dependent upon recombinases instead of restriction enzymes and dna ligase. we decided to use the gateway system because it was a proven method, and the enzyme cocktail required to implement the strategy was commercially available .

as shown in figure  <dig>  our grim strategy incorporates attb sites onto the 5' and 3' ends of a linear dna template for a mir-30-based artificial mirna shuttle. these attb sites can then recombine with attp sites located in the grim destination vector, to produce a longer attl site, which is an attb/attp hybrid . during the conceptual stages of this method, we modelled the grim.mirnaoff transcript in silico; based on its sequence and structure, we hypothesized that the attl site could interfere with mirna production because of steric hindrance and/or premature transcriptional termination. specifically, the attl sequence was predicted to fold into multiple hairpin secondary structures  that could inhibit transcriptional read-through to the mirna, and/or impair mirna processing ; and the attl dna template contained three stretches of termination signals for pol iii-dependent transcripts , which could prevent transcription of the full-length primary mirna transcript . from these concerns arose the strategy to flox the attl site and remove it with cre recombinase. although we predicted the attl site would partially interfere with mirna expression, we were surprised to discover that its presence prevented mirna production altogether . as a result, cre-inducibility emerged as an important, albeit somewhat unexpected, feature of the grim system. nevertheless, the grim system is versatile, and cre-inducibility is optional. as previously mentioned, our primary intention was to accelerate the mirna shuttle construction process, and our initial strategy involved removing the inhibitory attl site by simple transformation of grim.mirnaoff plasmids into cre-expressing, el <dig> e. coli. this virtually foolproof step produces a grim.mirnaon plasmid that is then constitutively 'on' when delivered to mammalian cells.

we also built in a mechanism to excise the grim.mirnaon cassette and turn it 'off' permanently with flp recombinase, and tested the functionality of this off-switch in stable cell lines . our goal here was to demonstrate that flp recombinase could negatively regulate our system. indeed, transient flp expression significantly reversed grim.milacz-mediated silencing, but we noted that βgal activity did not return to baseline . this was likely because the heat-labile cmv.flp construct we used  has low activity at 37°c  <cit> , which was the growth temperature of our hek <dig> stables. indeed, the optimal temperature for pog44-derived flp is 30°c. exposing grim.milaczon stable hek <dig> cells to heat-labile flp for a longer period of time, or expressing a thermostable form of the protein, would further improve the efficiency of gene silencing reversal.

finally, the current grim vector described here relies on the rna pol iii-dependent u <dig> promoter to drive mirna shuttle transcription. however, our strategy is likely not limited to pol iii promoters alone. indeed, inserting pol ii poly a signals  in two different locations within the current grim system would enable the use of tissue-specific pol ii promoters . first, the pol iii termination signal  placed at the 3' end of the artificial mirna can be replaced by one or more minimal pol ii poly a signals . second, if the putative pol iii termination signals in the attl site inhibit mirna production via premature termination of the primary transcript, an analogous situation can be produced for a pol ii promoter-driven transcript by simply placing one or more aataaa signals in the grim destination vector just downstream of the first loxp site . cre excision would then de-repress the pol ii-dependent grim vector, allowing processive mirna transcription until correct termination at the downstream polya signal. as with the pol iii-based system described in this manuscript, the option to build in the flp/frt shutdown mechanism would also provide the vector with additional versatility. thus, although the functionality of such a system remains to be tested, building tissue-specific pol ii promoters into the grim system could further expand the utility of this technology.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a simple, rapid, and versatile system to generate mirna expression plasmids using site-specific recombinases. one of the major advantages of our strategy is ease of construction; this feature has benefits for labs with extensive or minimal molecular biology skills . in addition, our method has a built-in cre recombinase-dependent 'on' switch that permits tight control of expression, and an optional mechanism to turn expression 'off' using flp recombinase. our system can therefore be used for more traditional gene silencing experiments, but also has applications for making inducible transgenic animals or rnai therapeutics  <cit> .

detailed strategy for designing artificial grim mirnas and the primers required for their construction. step <dig>  this strategy can be used to express a natural mirna. however, in this protocol, we describe engineering artificial grim mirnas for knocking down any gene of interest. each grim mirna is based on hsa-mir-30a sequences and structure. the natural mir-30a mature sequences are replaced by unique sense  and antisense  sequences derived from the target gene. in this example, we show the milacz and migfp constructs used in this manuscript. the orange nucleotides are derived from human mir-30a, except the 3' terminal poly u, which is added for use as a termination signal for the pol iii-dependent u <dig> promoter. the natural mir- <dig> drosha and dicer cut sites are maintained and indicated by blue and yellow arrowheads, respectively. the mismatch located just upstream of the drosha cut site  should be maintained for proper processing. choosing effective artificial mirna sequences targeting a gene of interest still requires some trial-and-error empirical testing. however, there are several publications describing specific rules for optimal inhibitory rna design. we found that incorporating two such guidelines improves the chances of identifying effective artificial mirna sequences. first, cellular gene silencing proteins  preferentially load the more thermodynamically unstable 5' end of a mirna duplex . thus, to ensure proper loading of the antisense guide strand, the antisense mirna strand should have more gc base pairs at its 3' end than its 5' end . second, the mature mirna sequence should have 60% or less gc content. to simplify design, we built both "rules" into our grim.reaper mirna design program . step  <dig>  the grim.mirna is ultimately transcribed from a dna template. step  <dig> illustrates the specific primer extension strategy used to create the dna template for a grim.mirna. four primers are annealed and extended using a thermostable dna polymerase, such as taq or pfx. commons primers  <dig> and  <dig> are used for all grim.mirna constructions. two unique primers with some common features are used to generate each specific mirna, as shown in the milacz and migfp examples here. although the design strategy provided here permits the end-user to create mirnas and primer sequences manually, we have automated this process using the grim.reaper design program .

model for converting the grim system from pol iii to pol ii dependence.  we hypothesize that rna pol iii termination signals  in the inhibitory attl <dig> site cause premature termination of grim.mirnas, which prevents mirna maturation and ultimately, gene silencing. cre removes the attl1-resident poly t terminators, thereby permitting full-length grim mirna transcription and maturation.  based on this model, the current grim system could be used with a pol ii-based promoter as well, with some modifications. specifically, the grim destination vector can be modified to contain a pol ii responsive poly a signal downstream of the 5' loxp site, which would serve to prematurely terminate a full-length grim.mirna. a second poly a signal, downstream of the mirna cassette, can then be added during the mirna donor construction. in the unfloxed state, the upstream poly a signal would be utilized thereby preventing mirna production and subsequent gene silencing. cre-mediated excision  would remove the upstream poly a signal along with the attl <dig> site, thereby permitting full-length mirna transcription, maturation, and gene silencing.

flow chart comparing traditional cut-and-paste molecular cloning methods versus the grim system. this chart illustrates the streamlined cloning process afforded by the grim system, compared to more traditional molecular construction methods. grim cloning requires markedly less hands-on and overall time for mirna expression vector construction. indeed, correct clones can be generated and confirmed 1- <dig> days earlier than with traditional molecular methods. moreover, restriction enzyme and ligation-based methods can sometimes be inefficient and vector generation may require repeated attempts. the high cloning efficiency of the grim system  circumvents this problem.
