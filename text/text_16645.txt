BACKGROUND
recent investigations from our laboratory  <cit>  showed that the isochore families of all vertebrate genomes explored are essentially conserved in gc levels  and in isochore sizes . moreover, at least in eutherian mammals and birds, even the relative amounts of isochore families  are largely conserved. it is well established by our previous work that a number of very basic genome properties, such as the distribution of genes and interspersed repeats, dna methylation, gene expression, replication timing and recombination, are different in gc-poor and gc-rich isochore families . these results obviously support the idea of isochores being a "fundamental level of genome organization"  <cit> , at least in vertebrates. we also suggested that the conservation of gc levels of isochore families may underlie chromatin structures  <cit> , and that the conservation of isochore size may be associated with their role in the structure and replication of chromosomes  <cit> .

the above points raise the question as to how general the isochore structure is in the genomes of metazoa. this is a pertinent question because evidence for a compositional heterogeneity was already obtained in our previous work on the genomes of trypanosomes, plasmodium and drosophila 

here we approached this problem by investigating the compositional compartmentalization of genomes from invertebrates in all cases in which either full sequences or at least scaffolds were available. the case of apis mellifera will be presented elsewhere because the presence in this genome of a very gc-poor family , which was absent from other insects, required a special analysis. expectedly, the present analysis broadens our view of the structure and evolution of isochores. in fact, it demonstrates that an isochore organization endowed with a number of shared features is found in the genomes of all metazoans explored in the present work.

RESULTS
isochore patterns
 the c-values in mb are also reported.

bold figures indicate the majority isochore families

figures in parentheses are overestimated 

among insects , the three drosophila species studied and anopheles gambiae display three isochore families: a minor l <dig> family, a predominant h <dig> family and a h <dig> family which is barely represented in drosophila, but is rather abundant in anopheles. a very minor  l <dig> component appears to correspond to chromosome  <dig> in drosophilids and is barely represented  in a. gambiae. the isochore families of insects are shown along those of a fish, stickleback.

the compositional patterns of scaffolds or contigs from branchiostoma floridae, strongylocentrotus purpuratus, aedes aegypti, tribolium castaneum and daphnia pulex are shown in figure  <dig>  compositional distribution were generally narrow, covering a range of about 5% gc, with the exception of t. castaneum in which case the range was about 10% gc, the center of distribution being lower  than in the other cases.

gc levels and dinucleotides of isochore families
the average gc levels of the isochore families from the invertebrates investigated are very close to each other and to the corresponding values of vertebrates .

as far as dinucleotide patterns are concerned, c. intestinalis showed a remarkable observed/expected  pattern in that complementary dinucleotides belonged in two classes, higher and lower than statistical expectation, respectively . indeed, aa/tt, ac/gt, ca/tg, cc/gg were in the more frequent class, whereas ag/ct, ga/tc were in the less frequent class. the dinucleotides from all these pairs showed the same frequency. in contrast, ta and cg were less frequent than their complementary dinucleotides at and gc. moreover, at/ta belonged to the less frequent class whereas cg/gc were close to statistical expectation.

some features of the c. intestinalis, a urochordate, were also found in c. elegans, a nematode. indeed in c. elegans aa/tt, cc/gg and ca/tg were also high, whereas ag/ct were also low, but, in contrast, ga/tc were low and ac/gt were high. trinucleotides frequencies, showed the expected similarities and differences .

aa/tt, cc/gc and ca/tg were also high in the insects , whereas ag/ct was low in insects , and at/ta were low  in all cases .

very interestingly, cg was remarkably low in s. purpuratus and b. floridae. the  <dig>  values attained are, however, still much higher than the  <dig>  values reached by mammals .

isochore sizes
the average size from the most represented families of isochores  is about  <dig>  mb  for c. intestinalis, but higher values were found for c. elegans  for drosophilids  and a. gambiae . the gc-poorest isochore families comprise two size groups, a large one and a small one, as in the case of vertebrates  <cit> . in particular, c. elegans showed a number of extremely long gc-poor stretches . in contrast, the gc-richest isochores are characterized by one size group, the small one .

discussion
c. intestinalis and c. elegans essentially show a very predominant l <dig> isochore family and a minor l <dig> family, a compositional pattern mimicking that of zebrafish. the case of c. intestinalis is of interest because a previous investigation by analytical ultracentrifugation in a cscl density gradient had shown a remarkable homogeneity at an average molecular weight of  <dig> kb  <cit> . the apparent discrepancy can, however, be explained by the fact that the cscl investigation dealt with random fragments, whereas the present one with  <dig> kb unique segments. the latter show an average standard deviation of  <dig> % gc  a value very slightly above the average standard deviation of  <dig> kb segments from human isochores from the l <dig> and l <dig> families. the dinucleotide patterns  present some significant differences , which are also expectedly shown by trinucleotides.

among insects, the drosophilids exhibit similar isochore patterns that are intermediate between those of medaka and stickleback with a major h <dig> family and two minor l <dig> and h <dig> families. another point of interest is the close similarity of gc levels of the isochore families as assessed on drosophilids and anopheles . the compositional pattern of a. gambiae, although being mainly represented by h <dig> isochores, shows a substantial amount of h <dig> isochores. in fact, the gc-richer isochores of a. gambiae have probably been underestimated because of the presence of a large number of 100-kb gc-rich stretches that were pooled with the flanking regions because of the procedure used in assessing isochores .

in the other cases, certainly a number of factors played a role and led to different compositional patterns. indeed, we already noted that while the large evolutionary changes in isochore patterns occurring between mammals/birds and amphibians/fishes mainly depend upon body temperature, definitely other factors play a role as well in the case of fishes.

the average sizes exhibited by different isochore families of invertebrates showed a greater variability compared to those of the corresponding families from vertebrates  <cit> . this may be due, however, to artefactual reasons, such as gaps, but also to the experimental approach used. indeed, in the human genome  <cit> , isochores were taken to be at least  <dig> kb in size, a condition linked to the need of assessing standard deviations of the  <dig> kb segments used in the analysis. expectedly, this occasionally led to standard deviation higher than  <dig> % gc within a given isochore. since however this only concerned ~7% of the human genome such "transition isochores" were accepted.

in the case of c. elegans long stretches of dna very low in gc and belonging to l <dig> isochores were present and interspersed short l <dig> isochores were neglected. if one accepts in this case isochores reaching a low size value of  <dig> kb, the very long l <dig> structures are resolved into shorter stretches and the high size values are brought back to the  <dig> - <dig> mb range. for instance, in the case of c. elegans the large size  estimated according to the criteria of costantini et al.  <cit> , is reduced to  <dig>  mb, if  <dig> kb segments belonging to the gc range of l <dig> isochores  are considered separately. this considerations also applies to the large size of major families of insects as indicated by thin 100-kb lines appearing in the gc profiles.

CONCLUSIONS
the major conclusions of the present investigations are the following:  an isochore structure appears to be general for all metazoans explored; this raises the question whether, in fact, all eukaryotic genomes are characterized by an isochore structure; current work on plants and unicellular eukaryotes should clarify this point;  the isochore families are generally characterized by gc levels that were identical or very close to those of vertebrates;  differences in dinucleotide patterns  were found among invertebrates, as well as between invertebrates and vertebrates; in the latter case, the most salient feature was the cpg shortage which is due to the methylation of c in cpg followed by its deamination to t; this feature was also found in s. purpuratus and b. floridae even if at a lower extent compared to mammals;  the average size of isochore shows a certain variability, which is apparently due at least to a large extent to artefactual reasons, as discussed in the preceding section;  no correlation was found between isochore size and genome size in spite of the very large genome size range explored so far; this practical independence of isochore size on genome size stresses their possible correlation with the structure and replication of chromosomes, as suggested by costantini and bernardi  <cit> ;  the relative amounts of isochore families are different in different genomes, a situation due in our opinion to the different environmental factors that play a role in determining compositional patterns of genome ;  gene concentration increases with increasing gc of isochore families, as previously found for vertebrates.

these conclusions are in keeping with some previous suggestions  <cit> : that  the high similarity of gc levels of isochore families may be due to their composition being linked to chromatin structure;  the increasing variability in isochore patterns from warm- to cold-blooded vertebrates and to invertebrates may be correlated with the increasing dependence from environmental factors that affect genome organization and functions;  the distribution of genes seems to be dictated by the need of a certain genomic context, whose composition influences the transcriptional activity, and also the structure and function of the encoded proteins.
