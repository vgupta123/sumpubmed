BACKGROUND
evolutionary change in a population, in response to a change in environment, consists of an increase in the frequency of favourable mutations. if the mutation was recent and the selection is strong, all alleles on the same chromosome segment as the mutant allele will increase in frequency by hitchhiking, generating a characteristic selection sweep or selection signature  <cit> . on the other hand, if selection at individual loci is weak or if the mutation is old, and therefore part of the standing variation when selection commences, little evidence of the selection may be left in the genome e.g.  <cit> . many statistics have been proposed to detect signatures of selection but they all suffer from a severe problem – the distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis of no selection is usually unknown. this is because the distribution depends on the demography of the population, including changes in effective population size and migration, which are difficult to define. consequently, no formal test that a statistic comes from the null distribution is possible. generally, the most extreme values of the statistic are simply assumed to be due to selection and there have been many papers claiming to find evidence for signatures of selection. the evidence for selection sweeps at a small number of loci, such as for lactase persistence in humans  <cit>  and skin wrinkling in shar-pei dogs  <cit> , is well documented and convincing, but in other cases it is hard to evaluate the strength of evidence. certainly the evidence and persuasiveness of authors advocating adaptation via standing polymorphisms is increasing  and the influential paradigm of ‘hard sweep’ selection signatures is beginning to lose favour as the primary mechanism of adaptation  <cit> .

in this study we have taken a different approach – we study sites in the genome at which we know selection has occurred to see if a signature of selection has been left behind. by studying a variety of selected loci, we are able to describe when a selection signature is generated and when it is not. domestic cattle have been under quite strong, recent and well documented selection for several traits and hence their genomes should contain evidence of this selection. we use  <dig> domestic bos taurus cattle breeds and three types of loci which have been under selection: type  <dig> loci are genes that are part of the definition of a breed, such as absence of horns and coat colour; type  <dig> loci have a large effect on quantitative traits, such as stature and milk yield, and type  <dig> loci are quantitative trait loci  for milk production traits in dairy cattle. we consider two statistics that indicate selection signatures within a breed and fst . our results show clear signatures of selection when intense selection has been applied to a single locus because it causes a trait defining the breed such as coat colour. however, we find weak evidence for selection signatures at regions of the genome associated with complex traits under selection. this paper calls into question the reliability of selection signatures to identify mutations affecting complex traits under selection and provides empirical evidence for the ability to generate substantial genetic change between populations in complex traits without clear evidence for classic selection signatures.

RESULTS
measures of selection
the dataset consists of  <dig>  domestic cattle with >  <dig>   genome-wide autosomal snp from  <dig> b. taurus breeds. breeds were of european origin and have had previous, recent selection for milk  or meat  production. there were between of  <dig>  and  <dig>   animals genotyped per breed.

three statistics were calculated to test for evidence of selection: a modified version of depaulis-veuille’s h-test   <cit> , the integrated haplotype score   <cit> , and wright’s measure of population differentiation . the measure of haplotype homozygosity  measures selection within breed and is defined as the variance of haplotypes frequencies at a particular position in the genome, i.e.  where pi is the  frequency of the ith haplotype and n is the total number of haplotypes at the position. the haplotypes consist of  <dig> or  <dig> consecutive snps. this statistic is high if one or more haplotypes are at high frequency while most haplotypes exist at low frequency. similarly, |ihs| identifies within breed selection and snp where one allele is found on one or few long haplotypes whereas the other allele is associated with many haplotypes. both haph and |ihs| are efficient for identification of sweeps which have not yet reached fixation, an essential feature for an association with type  <dig> loci . in contrast, the fst measurement is most efficient when there are large allele frequency differences between pairs of breeds. selection is indicated by high values of fst near the selected mutations because, for example, a population in which selection has taken place is expected to differ from other populations  in the allele frequency for markers near the mutation.

the  <dig> measures of selection were calculated in 250 kb windows across the genome, where the value for each window was the mean haph, the maximum observed |ihs| or the average between breed fst. to correct for average differences within and between breeds for haph and fst, the values are standardised by dividing the window value by the mean value for all windows. consequently the standardised estimates of selection have a mean of  <dig>  |ihs| was calculated following  <cit> , and is thus standardised such that |ihs| can be interpreted as standard deviations from the mean. the estimates  of haph, |ihs| and breed comparisons for fst are given in additional file  <dig> . we examined the 5% of the genome with the strongest evidence for selection.

breed-defining loci  and large effect qtl  were identified from the literature and the online inheritance in animals database  <cit> . for type  <dig> loci, we used the holstein and jersey breeds to identify qtl regions in the genome for milk production traits using the ‘genomic selection’ methodology  <cit> . these two breeds have been under strong selection for milk production for at least the last 100 years  <cit>  and especially since the 1970’s . in genomic selection, the prediction of genetic merit is a linear regression in which each snp genotype is multiplied by the estimated effect of a snp and summed to yield an estimated breeding value  for the animal. in our case, we want to attach variation in the trait to each chromosome segment. thus we estimated the effect of each snp using the genomic selection methodology and then calculated the variance across animals for a local 250 kb ebv e.g.  <cit> . the 5% of windows with the highest variance were considered to have qtl and defined as type  <dig> loci.

breed-defining loci often showed selection signatures
there were  <dig> loci that control phenotypes which are characteristics of the breed. these loci are polled  and  <dig> loci  that determine coat colour . most of these loci  have previously been reported as under selection e.g.  and we find evidence for all loci of within breed selection using haph .table  <dig>

there is evidence for more than one selected mutation at each of the type  <dig> loci. this evidence includes selection within  <dig> or more breeds but large fst between these selected breeds as well as between each selected breed and the breeds not selected at this gene. for example, near polled we found within breed selection signatures  for limousin, charolais, angus, holstein, hereford, murray grey and shorthorn and across-breed differentiation  for holstein with angus, murray grey and limousin . this is consistent with the  <dig> different reported mutations for polled <cit> , where the pc allele segregates in angus, charolais, limousin and hereford and the pf allele segregates in holstein. selection signatures near polled in western european cattle are also thought to pre-date pc mutation  <cit> , indicating the possibility of further  alleles. we also propose allelic heterogeneity for pmel in charolais and murray grey cattle, where both breeds show strong within breed selection using haph but a large value of fst between them . different pmel mutations are known to segregate in charolais and scottish highland cattle  <cit> , and here it appears the charolais mutation is also different to a pmel mutation in murray grey.figure  <dig>

the observed frequency of the selected haplotype played an important role in determining the ability of the three test statistic to indicate selection. at polled, for example, neither haph nor |ihs| indicated evidence of within breed selection in murray grey despite all animals of this breed being polled. this is because this region is homozygous in murray grey and neither of these statistics indicates selection in homozygous regions, being either undefined  or with values close to zero . further at pmel, long selected haplotypes were indicated by haph and fst in murray grey but there was no |ihs| selection signature near the locus. the results show that fst is most efficient when the region is near fixation  in alternate breeds, |ihs| is most efficient for intermediate frequency  variants  <cit>  and haph is midway between the two measures.

the mode of action and favoured phenotype also determined if loci indicated selection. in shorthorn, for example, there was no within breed selection signature near kitlg despite a roan coat  being a characteristic of this breed  <cit> . this can be explained by balancing selection, where heterozygotes express the roan phenotype and homozygotes have either a solid coloured or white coat, which would not be efficiently detected by any method. there was also evidence for a within breed selection near kitlg in hereford. herefords do not have a roan phenotype and, considering results in fleckvieh cattle  <cit> , this may indicate that a kitlg mutation contributes to the characteristic white spotting pattern seen in hereford and fleckvieh.

selection at known loci affecting quantitative traits
there were  <dig> type  <dig> loci chosen which had large effects mutations on stature , milk production  and muscle mass  . these loci were examined for the presence of selection signatures and, for dgat <dig>  ghr and abcg <dig>  to confirm their effect on milk production . selection signatures indicating selection in dairy, as compared to beef, breeds have previously been reported for ghr and abcg <dig> <cit> , while other loci  have previous reported selection signatures e.g.  <cit> .table  <dig>

we find evidence for selection signatures near all type  <dig> loci, but the evidence had greater ambiguity than for the breed-defining  loci in most cases. the notable exception was at mstn, where there was clear evidence of recent and strong selection in the limousin breed . the other loci showed more ambiguous patterns of selection. in the case of abcg <dig> and ghr, this was likely to be because selection signatures were affected by several mutations in the region. for example, near abcg <dig> there is a strong selection signature in charolais, probably due to selection at the lcorl or ncapg locus  <cit> , and there appears to be several qtl for milk production traits in bta <dig> near ghr <cit> . in other cases, such as plag <dig>  a more complex pattern of selection arises . for instance, limousin differ from other breeds for most windows in the region except a window centred near lyn and incorporating plag <dig>  limousin seem to have the same haplotype as other breeds in the immediate lyn-plag <dig> region but differentiate in the surrounding region. this could be explained if the mutation was introduced into limousin from another breed and one hybrid haplotype became the common ancestor for most limousin haplotypes in the region.figure  <dig>

aligning selection signatures and qtl in dairy cattle was also not always straight forward. sometimes this was because alleles did not segregate within the dairy breeds and sometimes because recent selection was for the ancestral  allele. for example, there was no stature qtl for holstein or jersey near plag <dig> because jerseys have a high frequency of the ancestral allele and holstein have a high frequency of the  mutant allele  <cit> . further, our qtl results confirm the segregation of the dgat <dig> mutation in both dairy breeds  but dgat <dig> showed within breed selection signatures only in the beef breeds. it is possible that selection some time ago was for the mutant allele  because it increased milk volume but more recent selection in jersey and holstein has been for the ancestral allele because it increases milk fat. thus the recent selection in dairy breeds is not detected within either jerseys or holsteins because selection has been for the ancestral allele which is likely to be carried on a variety of haplotype backgrounds and so is unlikely to show a discernible selection signature.

has selection for milk production left selection signatures in dairy cattle?
type  <dig> loci are regions of the genome which show genetic variation in holstein and jersey cattle for  <dig> different production traits . most of these traits have been under strong recent selection . we used a chi-squared test to investigate if there was greater overlap, than expected by chance, between the windows identified as containing qtl  and windows identified with selection signatures . the within breed measures of selection  assess haplotype frequencies and should be efficient at detecting on-going recent selection while, in contrast, high fst between dairy by beef breeds will identify areas of the genome where there is differentiation between dairy and beef breeds, but not within either group.

overall, there was a relatively weak association between qtl and selection signatures . there was evidence for an association between |ihs| and qtl for protein yield in holstein and between |ihs| and qtl for stature in jersey . there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  times the number of windows with qtl and high |ihs| than expected by chance. there was no association between selection as measured by haph or dairy-beef fst and any traits. this is despite the strong correlation between |ihs| and haph, where  <dig>  and  <dig> times more windows were identified in the top 5% of haph and |ihs| than expected by chance . increasing the proportion of the genome considered to contain qtl and showing selection signatures did lead to a weak association between selection signatures and qtl. for example, the number of windows in top 20% for |ihs| and qtl variance was about  <dig>  times the number expected by chance for all traits, with the exception of fat and protein percentage in milk for jersey. this weak association was nevertheless significant . thus our data supports weak selection across many loci for most production traits.table  <dig>

traits analysed for type  <dig> loci are: fat yield , milk yield , protein yield , stature , fertility , fpc  and ppc .



windows with high fst values between beef and dairy breeds were not enriched for qtl affecting production traits  even when the proportion of the genome considered was increased to 20%. thus despite many generations of selection for increased milk production in dairy cattle, we do not find big differences in allele frequency between beef and dairy breeds near qtl for milk production. this may indicate that genetic drift between beef and dairy breeds is greater than the effects of selection. our finding are in contrast to other studies  <cit> , which used fewer snp and fewer breeds than in the current analysis. however, windows containing qtl in holstein were significantly over-represented  in the windows with qtl for the same trait in jersey , for all traits except fertility. thus at least some qtl appear to segregate in both breeds. if the same alleles segregate in both breeds, this implies that either the polymorphisms existed since before the breeds diverged or it may be the result of admixture among our dairy cattle populations. given that some qtl segregate across breeds, it is perhaps surprising that selection has not caused both dairy breeds to differ from the beef breeds as measured by fst.

novel regions with strong selection sweeps in the genome
it is possible that selection has operated for traits other than those reported in table  <dig> so we considered the overall prevalence of strong selection signatures in the genomes for the  <dig> cattle breeds. based on long regions of high haph, there were a total of  <dig> regions which contained windows from the top 5% of within breed selected windows and were greater than  <dig> mbp in length  and  <dig> cases where sweeps were >  <dig> mbp .table  <dig>

six of the  <dig> long regions of high haph could be ascribed to the type  <dig> and type  <dig> loci. the strong selection sweep on bta <dig> in shorthorn contains the agouti  locus , which is known to affect coat colour in several species  <cit> . however, phenotypic expression of asip requires an agouti-susceptible allele at mc1-r, such as the wild-type e+ allele found in jerseys  <cit> . thus most of our other breeds will not show a coat colour phenotype from asip mutations. there seems to be a selected mutation specific to british breeds  and, although asip mutations are unlikely to affect coat colour in these cattle, the locus may have affected coat colour in ancestors without the mc1-r mutation or the mutation may affected other traits such as fatness and homeostasis  <cit> .

other strong selection sweeps for several breeds were located on bta  <dig>  and bta  <dig>  . however, unlike the asip region, fst in these two regions did not indicate clear differentiation patterns between the breeds and breeds within the selected group frequently differed from each other. the selected region on bta <dig> was particularly gene dense and includes, among others,  <dig> olfactory receptor loci. interestingly, this region was also identified in an independent study of fleckvieh cattle  <cit> . the large sweep identified in shorthorn on bta <dig>  contains lepr  which has been reported to be associated with multiple growth and fatness traits in beef cattle  <cit> . the longest identified selected region in holstein, where we had the largest number of genotyped animals , was on bta <dig>  in a region also supported by a high |ihs| value, a promising candidate is fgf <dig> ) . there is functional evidence for the involvement of fgf <dig> in lactation, as it has been found to be highly expressed in lactating  breast tissue and milk  <cit> . the selection signature on bta <dig> was also identified by stella et al. <cit> . the region contains slc35a <dig>  transporter), member a3; at  <dig>  mbp) which is the gene at which a recessive lethal mutation causes complex vertebral malformations  in holstein cattle  <cit> . a lethal recessive mutation would not cause the type of selection signature detected here but selection at a nearby linked locus could explain why the mutation in slc35a <dig> has drifted to high frequency.

some of the long selection sweeps reported in table  <dig> could be the result of random processes, such as genetic drift or demographic changes, rather than selection. however, we find that strong selection  sweeps are relatively rare in our  <dig> breeds of cattle. this is despite strong, recent selection for numerous traits and particularly for milk production traits in our dairy breeds. thus one can conclude the substantial genetic improvement in milk yield in dairy cattle has not generated many clear signatures of selection.

discussion
we searched for selection signatures at locations in the genome which were likely to be under selection using dense snp genotypes in the genomes of  <dig> domestic b. taurus cattle breeds. the evidence is consistent with one or more mutant alleles having been selected to high frequency in some of the eight breeds for some of loci we investigated. consistent with a ‘hard sweep’ model of selection, the breeds carrying the mutant allele show a common long haplotype  and a large genetic distance  from the breeds carrying the ancestral allele or a different mutant allele in the region. we clearly observed this type of selection pattern at pmel and mstn. however, selection signatures at loci with a large effect on complex traits under selection  were weaker, and almost absent for most qtl for traits under selection . how can these results be explained?

a classic ‘hard sweep’ is expected when the environment changes such that a mutation that would previously been detrimental becomes favourable. typically there is a lag and then the frequency of the favoured allele increases slowly until it reaches a modest frequency after which it is swept quickly to fixation. this is the pattern seen, for instance, in insecticide resistance  <cit> . our data on polled, mc1-r, kit, kitlg, pmel, plag <dig> and mstn are consistent with this explanation although here the changed ‘environment’ is one in which cattle owners control which animals will be allowed to breed. the selected mutations were probably deleterious in the wild and this natural selection may still operate in domestic cattle along with the artificial selection applied by cattle owners. therefore to drive a mutation rapidly to high frequency, artificial selection must be strong and natural selection weak. this combination is likely for some coat colour mutations – if a breed is defined to be red, then selection for a red mutation will be very strong while natural selection against the mutation may be weak, particularly if natural selection was related to environmental factors that have been reduced through the process of domestication .

on the other hand, mutations with a large effect on growth, reproduction or milk production are likely to have detrimental side effects even under domestication. pleiotropy is commonly observed for large-effect mutations, such as plag <dig> affecting fertility and stature  <cit>  or dgat <dig> affecting both milk volume and solids   <cit> , and it is unlikely that the overall effect of a particular mutation would always be favourable. consequently, few mutations affecting these types of traits will be driven rapidly to high frequency and leave a clear selection signature. occasionally large-effect mutations with small or inconspicuous pleiotropic effects are observed as under strong selection. we observed strong selection in limousin at mstn and there is strong, recent selection near the plag <dig> region in brahman cattle despite its negative effects on fertility  <cit> .

thus the results for type  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> loci are best reconciled by considering the selection on each locus. selection for simple  traits applies strong selection pressure to a mutation and the results are consistent with a ‘hard sweep’ model of selection. however, complex traits in our data were not associated with classic selection signatures and ‘hard sweeps’ are relatively rare despite the recent selection for milk traits in our dairy cattle. this suggests the selection response is caused by weak selection at many sites across the genome, probably for previously segregating variants. weak selection is expected since each qtl has a small effect the on phenotype e.g.  <cit> . since there are many loci, each with small effect, selection will not change the allele frequency rapidly and there will be little evidence of a selection sweep. small changes to allele frequencies at many loci can combine to make large changes to a phenotype, consistent with the large selection response observed for the complex traits in our data. the ability to detect selection sweeps would be further hampered if selection was conducted on genetic variants already segregating in the population. innan & kim  <cit> , for example, find the initial frequency of the selected alleles to be one of the primary determinants for the ability to detect a selection event using classic selection signatures.

the explanation of weak selection on old genetic variation for complex traits, although speculative, is supported by other evidence. one key and consistent observation in support of selection on standing variants is the rapid and immediate response to selection observed for most  heritable characters in domestic and experimental populations  <cit> . this supports frequency changes to mutations already segregating in the population because, given the rapid response, there is insufficient time for accumulation of new favourable mutations. the selection response does not usually show an acceleration, as seen with insecticide resistance, but is approximately linear and can be predicted from estimates of the genetic variance prior to selection. nor does the selection response diminish and reach a plateau e.g.  <cit> , except in small populations, indicating that few genes of large effect have reached fixation. historically, debate on the mutations underlying the response to selection was divided by strong selection at a few loci or relatively weak selection at many loci. however in holstein, for example, there has been large increases in milk production with very few ‘hard sweeps’ observed in the genome and few observations of large-effect qtl.

although we show that most selection for complex traits does not leave a classic signature of selection, we do not imply that selection does not change the allele frequency at sites causing variation in complex traits. turchin et al. <cit>  show that mutations affecting human height have been subject to selection because, at many loci, the alleles for increased height have higher frequency in northern than in southern europe. however, turchin et al. present no evidence that a selection signature could be discerned if the sites associated with variation in height were not already known. in human height and in cattle milk yield, selection has no doubt changed allele frequencies at causal loci but not enough to leave a selection signature that is recognisable in the absence of prior knowledge of loci associated with height or milk yield or indeed most complex traits. an implication of this conclusion is that searching for classic selection signatures is not a powerful method to map genes for complex traits even if the traits have been under selection.

identification of genomic regions under selection for complex traits requires approaches more sensitive to detect subtle changes in allele frequencies over time and with greater flexibility to detect selection on segregating variants. at least in domestic animals, the explicit use of the pedigree structure in may be more appropriate to detect genomic regions responsible for recent selection e.g.  <cit> . we did find a weak association between selection signatures  and qtl for milk production traits by considering 20% of the genome. however, finding such a weak association over such a large part of the genome is not very useful in practice. this weak association occurred despite the advantages of using genomic selection methodologies to identify qtl  <cit> . for example, compared to single snp regressions, our approach to identify qtl can capture a higher proportion of the genetic variance  <cit>  and has an improved ability to account for population stratification  <cit> .

the detection of clear selection signatures is compromised by a number of other factors that are illustrated by the individual loci that we examined. there are many traits subject to natural and artificial selection and many genes affect each trait. therefore the genome contains many possible sites of selection and this complicates the interpretation of the data. for instance, we examined the region surrounding abcg <dig> but may well have detected selection at ncapg-lcorl. the large number of loci segregating for many traits possibly also leads to complex results on bta <dig> where there are >  <dig> qtl for milk production  <cit> . also multiple alleles at a locus under selection seems to be common and could cloud the interpretation. we found or confirmed multiple alleles at polled, mc1-r, kit, kitlg and pmel. migration or introgression of a selected mutation from one breed to another leaves an unusual selection signature as shown by plag <dig> in limousin where fst between limousin and other breeds is high except at the position of the selected mutation. this pattern is expected if the common ancestor of all plag <dig> mutant alleles in limousin is a limousin haplotype that differs except at the plag <dig> mutation from haplotypes in other breeds carrying the same mutation. in the case of dgat <dig> there has been recent selection for the ancestral allele after possible earlier selection for the mutant. thus many of the small sample of genes studied display properties that complicate the interpretation of the data and decrease our ability to find clear evidence of classic selection signatures.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the conditions that give rise to a clear selection signatures  are rare. more usually the response to selection is based on small frequency changes at many loci that were already polymorphic in the population before selection began. consequently, many of the claims for identifying loci affecting complex traits using selection signatures must be treated with caution.
