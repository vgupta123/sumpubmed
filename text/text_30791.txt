BACKGROUND
in the past decade of drug discovery, peptide-based drugs have gathered momentum as a class of therapeutics, with their global market impact expected to increase significantly in the future  <cit> . previously, the spectrum of available drugs consisted primarily of small molecules that target deep binding pockets on proteins to inhibit enzyme function. however, small molecules are generally not well-suited for binding to large, flat surfaces on a protein to inhibit protein-protein binding, a process that is critical for treating many human diseases  <cit> . in addition, small molecules frequently lack binding specificity, a disadvantage that can lead to failure in the development pipeline or to adverse side effects, even among drugs on the market  <cit> . in contrast, biologic-based drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies, have been found to be highly specific and effective blockers of protein-protein interactions, and their clinical use has transformed medicine over the past decade. despite the growing success of antibody-based drugs, they do have several limitations. they are large and complex macromolecules that need to be delivered by injection, have long circulating half-lives with little ability to control drug levels in patients precisely, leading to safety consequences, and lack durability with patients losing response due to immunogenicity.

in contrast to proteins, peptides, as defined in this study, consist of up to  <dig> amino acid residues and lack a hydrophobic core  <cit> . the simplest peptides are linear and disordered, assume structure only upon binding to a protein, and are prone to degradation by host proteases. thus, peptide drug design strategies often seek to engineer structure into the peptide  <cit> . these approaches include induction of secondary structure such as β-turns, α-helices and β-hairpins  <cit> ; head-to-tail cyclization  <cit> ; and incorporation of non-standard amino acid residues, as in peptoids  <cit> . of particular interest is creating a peptide fold through formation of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues that are distant from each other in the peptide sequence. in this study, we define a disulfide-rich peptide, or drp, as a peptide consisting of up to  <dig> residues and incorporating between one and four disulfide bonds. drps often do possess a hydrophobic core, although this region is generally occupied by the bonded cysteines.

many of the desirable properties of therapeutic compounds found in drps are demonstrated by their biological functions. they frequently adopt the ‘knottin’ motif in which six or more cysteines form disulfide bonds in an interlocking arrangement, often incorporating head-to-tail cyclization  <cit> . the knottin motif consists of several forms, each with its own possible secondary structure elements; these forms include the inhibitory cysteine knot , in both its classic and cyclotide arrangements, as well as the cysteine-stabilized αβ  fold  <cit> . knottins have diverse functions ranging from plant defense  <cit>  to incapacitating prey when expressed as toxins in venomous animals  <cit> , and have been reported to show low-immunogenic potential  <cit> , which avoids challenges often presented by other biologics, such as antibodies. another fold class is small β-hairpins stabilized both by the standard backbone hydrogen-bond patterns as well as one or more disulfide bonds linking the paired β-strands. these hairpins are often natural protease inhibitors  <cit> , or can be converted to such with simple modifications  <cit> . other examples of drps in nature include anti-microbial defensins  <cit> , small conotoxins  <cit> , and insulin  <cit> .

disulfide bonds stabilize the fold of a peptide by decreasing the entropy of the system proportionally to the number of residues between the linked cysteines  <cit> . this increased stability confers beneficial properties necessary in a drug, including enhanced potency, selectivity, permeability, thermal stability, resistance to denaturation at low ph, protection against proteolytic attack  <cit> , and in some instances increased activity when delivered orally . disulfide bonds may lock the molecule into a conformation that is complementary to a protein target  <cit> , providing an opportunity to engineer the surface with new functionality while maintaining the fold. for example, a number of studies have grafted the binding surface of a protein onto a drp scaffold, resulting in a molecule that retains the advantages of drps while reproducing the binding properties of the original protein  <cit> . current drugs on the market incorporating disulfide bonds include insulin, orally delivered linaclotide for treating inflammatory bowel syndrome  <cit> , ziconotide for treatment of pain  <cit> , and pramlintide as an adjunct therapy for type ii diabetes  <cit> .

while drps are used as starting points for designing inhibitors of protein-protein interactions, modifying the drp sequence to enable specific binding to a desired protein target remains a challenge. one potential solution is phage display, which can sample up to  <dig> unique protein sequences and allows for selection of those that bind the target  <cit> . in one form of this experiment, a dna library encoding a peptide, with some or all of the codons randomized, is ligated into a phage plasmid in a gene encoding for a coat protein, resulting in a library of phage expressing diversified peptide sequences on their surface. the library is then introduced to an immobilized protein target and screened in a procedure referred to as ‘panning’. phage particles with peptides that bind the immobilized target are selected over those that do not, which are subsequently washed away. the enriched population of clones expressing binding peptides is then amplified and the process is repeated in an iterative panning and amplification process. finally, the selected phage clones, referred to as hits, are sequenced and the peptides corresponding to those sequences are synthesized and assayed to confirm binding or in some cases functional activity. a number of studies have used drps as phage library scaffolds  <cit> ; we have recently reported the rational design and development of potent il- <dig> compounds using this method  <cit> .

a drawback in phage display is that a single phage library may yield no hits when panned against a target, regardless of the sequences displayed in the library, due to  the possibility that none of the generated sequences is complementary to the target or  the inability to select rare and weakly active phage clones in a large pool of inactives. therefore, we hypothesize that the probability of obtaining a hit increases if multiple phage libraries encoding structurally distinct scaffolds are used. as more unique scaffolds are panned, it is increasingly likely that at least one of them will result in a sequence with sufficient affinity for binding the target. the challenge then becomes the selection of drps to use as phage library scaffolds. to reduce the odds of creating redundant phage libraries, we propose that the scaffold drps should be as structurally distinct, and should cover as large a fraction of known drp folds, as possible.

one solution to this challenge is to group drps according to structural similarity and select a representative from each drp cluster, thus guaranteeing that the representative drps are structurally distinct. the set of representatives should be small enough to make it experimentally tractable to construct a phage library using each representative as a scaffold. each cluster should include as many drps as possible, thus allowing for a maximum estimation of the fraction of total drp structural diversity covered by the representative peptides. finally, the method should be automated so that the clustering can be updated as more drp structures are solved and added to the protein data bank . however, the number of structural folds into which drps can be clustered is not known, so there is no guarantee that all of these properties can be achieved. there have been previous attempts to perform such clustering, but they were either focused on a subset of drp fold classes or required significant manual intervention .

here, we describe an automated drp clustering protocol that incorporates structural similarity and disulfide-bond conservation to group related drps, accompanied by a metric to select a representative member from each cluster for use as a scaffold for phage display. the method was applied to all known drp structures in the pdb. the  <dig> most populous clusters contained 85% of all structurally known drps. by examining the clusters, we analyzed the degree to which drps can be grouped together, examined how sequence conservation varies within each cluster, and assessed whether our approach has produced a set of scaffolds structurally distinct from each other but similar to other drps in their clusters. moreover, to demonstrate the utility of the method, we designed libraries based on three of the  <dig> scaffolds and panned them against the human interleukin- <dig> cytokine protein, resulting in a low micromolar hit from one of the three libraries.

previous approaches have been successful in engineering into a drp the ability to bind a target, either through phage display  <cit> , grafting the exact binding surface of a protein known to bind the target  <cit> , or a combination of the two  <cit> . based on these successes, we propose that using phage display to pan multiple scaffolds possessing maximally structurally diverse binding surfaces greatly increases the likelihood of finding an initial hit against a target. separately, we also hypothesize that, while drp folds found in the pdb are likely not completely representative of all drp folds found in nature, they do represent a large fraction, possibly even the majority of such folds, and thus our scaffolds are representative of a similarly large fraction of possible drp structural diversity. therefore, especially considering their favorable chemical and biological stabilities, the phage libraries for these  <dig> representatives will be a valuable resource for discovering drps interacting with protein targets.

RESULTS
grouping drps into fewer clusters as protocol proceeds
pipeline overview
our computational pipeline consisted of five steps:  filtering,  hierarchical clustering using native overlap as the distance metric,  reclustering knottins using disulfide distance as the distance metric,  re-assigning longer singletons, and  re-assigning shorter singletons .fig.  <dig> protocol details. a pipeline workflow. b example of hierarchical clustering using toy data, portrayed as a tree where the leaves are drps and each inner node represents a cluster containing all drps in the sub-tree rooted at that node. numbers at the branch point are the values of the distance metric when calculated across the two sub-trees that are being merged at the inner node. the red line is the empirically selected cutoff ; all sub-trees to the right of this cutoff represent the final clusters




filtering identical drps
the pdb was searched for individual chains with fewer than  <dig> residues and between one and four annotated disulfide bonds, resulting in  <dig>  drps fitting these criteria. this initial dataset was filtered further to remove identical drps, including  <dig> identical insulin chains, resulting in  <dig> representative structures .

native overlap clustering and cutoff determination
the  <dig> representative drps were clustered using native overlap as the distance metric in an average-linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm . the algorithm terminated when the smallest average native overlap between any two clusters was below a cutoff. the value of this cutoff was determined by trial-and-error, selecting the optimal cutoff of  <dig>  through visualization of clusters with 3d structure viewing software . a cutoff of  <dig>  was considered, but it resulted in assigning drps with clearly different folds to the same cluster; for example, small β-hairpins, which have tight turns in between successive β-strands, clustered with conotoxins, which are similar to hairpins in size but have rounded turns connecting loops or helices . on the other hand, a cutoff of  <dig>  was too stringent, assigning drps with very similar structures into different clusters . the average-linkage hierarchical clustering step using the selected native overlap cutoff of  <dig>  grouped the  <dig> drps into  <dig> clusters .fig.  <dig> determination of clustering cutoffs. top row: example of resulting clusters following the initial native overlap hierarchical clustering step. each image represents a different cutoff applied for determining the final clusters for that step. these images informed the decision of which cutoff to impose in the final protocol. a conotoxin and small hairpin clusters at the native overlap cutoff of  <dig> , which was ultimately selected as the final cutoff. b at a cutoff of  <dig> , the same conotoxin and small hairpin drps were assigned to the same cluster despite assuming different secondary structures. c at a cutoff of  <dig> , conotoxin drps were assigned to separate clusters despite each cluster fold consisting of circular loops and short helical regions. bottom row: example of a resulting cluster following the knottin reclustering step, with each image representing the knottin cluster containing the most drps after applying a different cutoff. only the disulfide bonds in the drps are displayed, in yellow. the cutoffs assessed were   <dig>  Å rmsd,   <dig>  Å rmsd, and   <dig>  Å rmsd.  <dig>  Å was selected as the optimal cutoff and used in the final protocol




knottin reclustering and cutoff determination
peptides were annotated with scop identifiers  <cit> . drps with the same scop fold identifiers were generally in the same clusters, validating the clustering procedure . however, the  <dig> ‘knottins’  were classified into  <dig> distinct clusters, due to their varied loop lengths. in phage display experiments, loop lengths may be varied as part of the library design, and the core structures of the scaffolds are of greater importance. therefore, knottins were reclustered by their core disulfide bond structure only , as follows.

clusters containing four or more drps annotated with the knottin fold were given as input to the average-linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm, here using the distance between equivalent disulfide bonds as the distance metric . a disulfide distance cutoff of  <dig>  Å was again selected by trial-and-error. this cutoff resulted in high structural overlap of disulfide bonds across drps in the knottin clusters  with a separation of ~ <dig>  Å between consecutive groups of bonds in the most populated cluster despite  <dig> members being present. the cutoff of  <dig>  Å resulted in a similar separation, but here, only  <dig> members were in the most populated cluster , resulting in suboptimal lower coverage. the cutoff of  <dig>  Å led to  <dig> members in the most populated cluster, but there was no clear visual separation apparent in consecutive groups of disulfide bonds . this cutoff would likely render selection of a representative scaffold problematic, as there would be no drp in the cluster that possessed a set of disulfide bonds structurally equivalent to all other members of the cluster. the optimal cutoff of  <dig>  Å reduced the number of clusters containing four or more knottins from  <dig> to  <dig> . together with all non-knottin clusters produced in step ii, there were  <dig> intermediate drp clusters .fig.  <dig> cluster drp coverage. clusters were sorted by size from most to least populated and each cluster was assigned an index starting with  <dig>  at each index i, the cumulative number of drps in that cluster and all clusters with index less than i was calculated and divided by the total number of drps in the dataset, resulting in the coverage. coverage as a function of index is displayed. coverage curves are shown after completion of successive steps of the procedure 




singleton reassignment
next, we observed that some drps in less-populated clusters had native overlaps above  <dig>  when aligned to peptides in clusters with more members. however, the hierarchical nature of the procedure grouped the most similar drps together with each iteration; this process sometimes resulted in a drp being grouped with its closest neighbor in a small cluster even if there was another more populated cluster containing members similar to that drp. provided the drp aligned to at least one peptide in the larger cluster at a native overlap of  <dig> , the drp was reassigned  to the larger cluster. this post-processing refinement increased the sizes of the most-populated clusters , and reduced the total number of clusters from  <dig> to  <dig> . the full composition of all clusters is available in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

drp majority representation in  <dig> structure folds
a primary goal of the clustering procedure was to identify a small number of representative drps, as this goal balanced a number of peptide scaffolds large enough to cover a significant fraction of drp structure space but small enough to be experimentally tractable in phage display experiments. the method resulted in  <dig> % of drps in the pdb being assigned to the top  <dig> most populated clusters . although  <dig> distinct drp folds were identified, the least populated  <dig> clusters each contained only nine or fewer drps, with  <dig> of these clusters containing a single peptide. it is feasible to construct  <dig> phage libraries, which would be structurally representative of nearly 85% of all drps whose structures have been solved. images of these top  <dig> clusters ranked by membership are presented in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> cluster visualization. the top  <dig> clusters by size are displayed. singleton drps are removed for clarity. drps are colored according to sequence conservation within the cluster, ranging from yellow  to gray  to blue . disulfide bonds are shown in red





structural diversity of cluster representatives
from each of the top  <dig> clusters, the drp with the largest average native overlap to all other members of that cluster was identified; this drp was selected as the representative member of the cluster and considered a potential scaffold for phage display. one goal of the study was to select representative drps that were structurally distinct from the other representatives, which was assessed by the average native overlap between the representatives. all representative drps had an average native overlap to other drps in their clusters of greater than  <dig> ; the median value across the  <dig> clusters was  <dig>  . in contrast, the median native overlap for pairs of representatives was only  <dig>  , indicating that the clustering procedure indeed resulted in a structurally diverse set of drp scaffolds that were truly representative of the majority of known drp structure space. additional details of each cluster are presented in table  <dig> table  <dig> matrix of structural diversity across clusters

for each cluster, the drp with the highest average native overlap value to all other drps in the cluster was selected as the representative member to be used as the basis for phage display libraries . these average native overlap values for the representative drps are displayed along the matrix diagonal in bold. additionally, pairwise structural alignments of all representatives were computed with salign; the resulting native overlap values are displayed in off-diagonal cells in the matrix

sequence dissimilarity of peptides in the same cluster
to examine the relationship between structure and sequence in the clusters, the average pairwise sequence identity among all members in each cluster was calculated . no cluster in the top  <dig> had average sequence identity higher than 60%, and ten of the clusters had average sequence identity of less than 25%, indicating that the binding partners of drps within the same cluster were likely diverse. sequence conservation was visualized by coloring the drp structures according to the degree of conservation at each residue position . in most of the clusters, the yellow conserved areas consisted of residues surrounding the disulfide bonds which likely contribute to drp stability, while the blue diverse areas were generally found in the loops and surface regions, which are more likely to interact with other proteins and are viable candidate regions for randomization through phage display.

panning against human interleukin-23
to demonstrate the utility of our clustering approach, phage display libraries were constructed for three representative drps and panned against the human cytokine protein interleukin- <dig> . inhibiting il- <dig> binding to its receptor  reduces inflammation and other adverse immune responses; thus, il- <dig> is an attractive therapeutic target, particularly in non-responders to anti-tnf agents  <cit> . the interaction between il- <dig> and il-23r is a typical protein-protein interaction involving a large flat recognition surface, and a low molecular weight binder to il- <dig>  which would prevent complex formation, would be challenging to discover.

the three selected drps were  from the large conotoxin cluster, an antagonist of vascular endothelial growth factor ;  from the small hairpin cluster, an agonist of erythropoietin , and  from the helix-loop-helix cluster, a derivative of protein-a . these drps were chosen due to their different secondary structure classes , which may maximize their binding diversity. moreover, the first two peptides were themselves products of phage display libraries, which suggested experimental tractability. one library was designed for each drp scaffold; these libraries were referred to by the pdb identifiers of their scaffolds  and 1zdcr <dig>  library scaffolds. d enrichment ratios across successive rounds of phage panning for the three libraries. panning was discontinued after the fourth round for 1katr <dig> and 1kvfr <dig> due to a lack of enrichment. e standard curve resulting from competition elisa experiment to assess inhibition of il-23/il-23r complex formation by the pn-05- <dig> clone




the libraries were constructed and screened against immobilized il- <dig> in successive rounds of panning. enrichment ratios, which compare the output titers in the target selection to a background negative control, were determined after each round. panning the 1katr <dig> and 1kvfr <dig> libraries was halted after four rounds due to the lack of enrichment; however, the 1zdcr <dig> library showed significant enrichment after the fourth round and was thus subjected to two further rounds of panning . after the sixth round, individual clones were isolated and assessed for binding with a phage elisa. positive clones were sequenced. one sequence, pn-05- <dig> was synthesized and tested in a competition elisa to assess inhibition of il- <dig> binding to il-23r. pn-05- <dig> inhibited binding with an ic <dig> of  <dig>  μm ; it is likely that this binding potency could be improved through medicinal chemistry approaches, as we have done previously for other targets  <cit> .

discussion
advantages of using structurally diverse scaffolds in phage display
the utility of phage display for developing lead compounds is well appreciated, with its proficiency deriving from the ability to make and screen libraries of up to  <dig> sequences and the linkage of genotype to binding phenotype  <cit> . typical peptide phage display involves the creation of large libraries sampling enormous sequentially continuous sequence space on unstructured peptides that assume structure only upon binding the target bait. the disordered nature of these peptides weakens the utility of phage display, as in some instances it is impossible to select the weakly active unstructured peptides from the vast majority of inactive peptides.

on the other hand, phage display of drps allows for sampling different sequences on a discontinuous surface in conformationally controlled structure space. one of the key requirements in discovering leads, and ultimately drugs, is to present the required functional groups in a sufficient orientation to yield potent and selective molecules at the target of interest, while optimizing the desired drug-like physicochemical features. this requirement is achieved through the common discontinuous surface patches of drps, described here, which represent naturally occurring fractions of chemical structure space explored by nature, and as such are biologically relevant. consequently, the probability of obtaining hits may be higher than with unstructured peptide phage libraries, or with small molecule scaffold topologies explored in combinatorial chemistry, which are typically not biologically relevant. this probability further increases when multiple structurally distinct libraries are panned. to develop such libraries, we require a set of diverse drp scaffolds.

these scaffolds were identified by the protocol in this study, which clusters drps by structural similarity over their full length and refines some of the clusters by incorporating the structural conservation of disulfide bonds and by resolving artifacts of the hierarchical clustering method through reassigning singletons to more populated clusters. the result was an experimentally tractable set of  <dig> structurally diverse, representative scaffolds from the most populated clusters that could be used for constructing phage display libraries.

drps are an emerging source of lead compounds in drug discovery due to their inherent chemical and biological stability characteristics, as exemplified by the marketed orally delivered drug linaclotide  <cit> . drp phage display libraries may provide a valuable, generic resource for the discovery of additional drp modulators of protein-protein interactions and may help alleviate the low hit rate currently plaguing the pharmaceutical sector.

next, we discuss the clusters in the context of drp properties as well as the phage display process.

evolutionary insights obtained through drp clustering
clustering drps by structure, and incorporating no annotation other than previous identification of some drps as knottins, revealed insights into drp structure. many clusters contained drps possessing structurally conserved disulfide bonds, as demonstrated through qualitative visual analysis. this conservation tends to occur in clusters with larger folds; for example, the egf-like hairpin, α-defensin, crambin, and tnf receptor clusters all had near-complete conservation of disulfide bonds . unlike the knottins, these clusters were aligned over the full length of their sequences in the initial hierarchical clustering step , yet resulted in high structural overlap among equivalent disulfide bonds, suggesting that there is strong selective pressure to maintain these cysteine pairings. this result corroborated the findings of a previous study that showed high disulfide bond conservation within the scop “small peptide” fold class  <cit> .

the clusters with the least amount of disulfide bond conservation were those containing peptides with shorter sequence lengths; examples include small hairpin and small conotoxin clusters. the n and c termini are proximal to each other in both of these folds, and in these peptides there were a number of possible position pairs between which disulfide bonding was sufficient to maintain the structure. thus, there was less evolutionary pressure to conserve a disulfide bond between specific positions than there is in longer drps. furthermore, in many cases there was likely no evolutionary pressure at all, as these clusters included peptides with diverse functions, or were engineered. nevertheless, cluster members assume similar folds, likely due to the reduced conformational sampling available to peptides of this size possessing two or more cysteines.

in addition to their utility as phage display libraries, and insight into disulfide bond conservation, the clusters allow for a broader view of drp evolution. for example, we wondered how drps from different species were distributed across the clusters. in a simple analysis, each pdb structure was mapped to its uniprot accession  <cit>  to obtain its annotated species, and the total number of species, as well as the ratio of drps to unique species in each cluster, was calculated . most clusters were composed of drps expressed across a number of different species. for example, the egf-hairpin cluster contained  <dig> peptides from  <dig> species; the average ratio of drps per species across the top  <dig> clusters was  <dig> . this result demonstrates the broad phylogenetic distribution of a small number of drp folds. these ratios were also calculated across taxonomic classification at higher levels. some clusters were distributed broadly even at the kingdom level; both the knottin csαβ i and classic ick clusters included drps in three kingdoms . as it is unlikely that a single fold resulted from three or more convergent events, this distribution across kingdoms suggests that these scaffold forms may have emerged early in the course of eukaryotic development, as has been hypothesized previously  <cit> . other clusters imply a narrower evolutionary path; for example, the crambin cluster comprised drps from only one class, liliopsida, which represents herbaceous monocots such as common wheat and barley.

discussion of selected cluster folds
detailed analysis of certain clusters may elucidate structure-function relationships among these unique peptides. first, the top  <dig> clusters included  <dig> composed primarily of knottin folds. knottins are characterized by a cysteine-knot architecture; generally, these peptides possess a c-terminal β-sheet connected to the n-terminal region by two or three disulfide bonds  <cit> . loops in knottins had high structural variability, rendering these peptides problematic when clustering them by native overlap over the full sequence. thus, an intermediate step in the protocol reclustered knottins based on structural overlap across their core disulfide bonds, which allowed for selection of a scaffold that was similar in core structure to other members of its cluster, but had the potential to present a binding surface in a similar conformation to a large number of other knottins, particularly if the loop size were to be varied as part of the phage display experiment. knottin disulfide bonds exhibited a remarkable degree of structural overlap, with  <dig> drps grouped into only  <dig> clusters .

notably, each of these clusters generally included peptides assuming a single knottin fold. most of the peptides in the largest cluster were of the csαβ fold, in which the n-terminal region forms an α-helix containing two or three cysteines that disulfide-bond with partner cysteines in the c-terminal β-sheet. the regular spacing of the cysteines along the α-helix leads to the observed tight clustering of peptides according to structurally equivalent disulfide bonds. additional csαβ drps were present in cluster  <dig>  cluster  <dig> consisted of peptides assuming the classic ick fold, with a few cyclotide icks, while cluster  <dig> was composed of almost all cyclotide peptides. these two knottin forms can be differentiated by the spacing of their six cysteines along the peptide sequence; classic icks have an arbitrary number of residues between the fourth and fifth cysteines, whereas cyclotides have only a single residue in this region. these cysteine spacing differences contributed to these folds being assigned separate clusters according to disulfide structural equivalency.

knottins in different clusters generally had different functions. the knottin csαβ i cluster was the largest of all drp clusters, with  <dig> members. of these peptides,  <dig> were potassium channel inhibitors, drawn from  <dig> species;  <dig> were defensins; and  <dig> assumed an egf-like fold, nine of which were found in human coagulation factors . none of these functions was assigned to drps in the knottin classic ick or knottin cyclotide ick clusters . instead, the classic ick cluster was composed of a diverse array of toxins, including conotoxins, agatoxins, and theraphotoxins, while the cyclotide ick cluster included trypsin inhibitors and cyclotides with antimicrobial functions, predominantly from plants. thus, core disulfide bond equivalency appeared to correlate strongly with different functions mediated by surface loops across different knottin folds.

similar to knottins, hairpin peptides fell into multiple clusters: small hairpin  and large hairpin . despite these peptides all consisting of simple β-strand pairs joined by one or two disulfide bonds, multiple clusters were created due to the significant differences in sequence lengths, similar to knottins. the large hairpin cluster afforded more space along the sequence to incorporate disulfide bonds; peptides in this cluster averaged  <dig>  disulfide bonds, compared with  <dig>  in the small hairpin cluster. additionally, large hairpins were more likely to be found in nature; 70% of cluster members were fully expressed peptides or isolated as a fragment from a full protein. nearly all of these peptides were serine protease inhibitors or membrane pore-forming peptides that exhibit antibacterial and antiviral activity. on the contrary, 72% of small hairpins were engineered, for example as the products of phage display libraries or synthesized to examine how different amino acid residue types contribute to the β-hairpin fold .

many hairpins had disulfide bonding patterns similar to those of the members of the small conotoxin cluster . for example, there were two members of the small hairpin cluster and seven members of the small conotoxin cluster with a cx9c motif, where x is any amino acid residue type other than cysteine; in fact, this motif represented the full sequence for the engineered drps 1n0aa in the small hairpin cluster and 3p72b in the small conotoxin cluster. this result indicates that care must be taken in designing phage libraries to ensure that a scaffold based on a hairpin maintains its fold; for example, certain amino acid residue types that confer hairpin properties should not be varied. alternatively, hairpins with fewer residues between bonded cysteines could have their full surface varied with the nnk codon, which would resemble traditional random peptide libraries that have been the focus of earlier studies  <cit> .

likelihood of additional uncharacterized drp folds
we have shown that 85% of drps with solved structures fall into  <dig> fold classes, although these  <dig> folds only represent approximately 1/ <dig> of all known drp folds given that  <dig> clusters were created overall. thus, drp sequences are distributed non-uniformly across known drp folds, as has been observed with globular and membrane protein sequences in general  <cit> . however, the question remained whether the pdb is biased toward drps with certain fold classes. the initial filtering step in our protocol was intended to reduce any bias by removing redundant proteins . filtering with the 90% sequence identity threshold  still resulted in  <dig> % of drps falling in the top  <dig> clusters , suggesting that the non-uniform size of the drp clusters was not an artifact of our procedure or the drp sample in the pdb. notably, among the  <dig> clusters output by our pipeline,  <dig> contained only one member, suggesting that there are additional unknown folds that are assumed by a small number of drp sequences.

phage display application
we have identified  <dig> structurally distinct peptides that can be used as scaffolds for phage display. the likelihood of success in a phage display experiment is dependent on library design. drp scaffolds offer unique challenges and opportunities in this respect. the most important design consideration is the choice of residues to vary. we propose that these residues should be located in regions that are not conserved in sequence, to decrease the probability of affecting peptide folding kinetics and stability. to this end, the degree of sequence conservation was quantified across equivalent residue positions within a cluster; the blue non-conserved regions in fig.  <dig> suggest optimal surfaces to vary in phage libraries. these regions frequently occur on loops and are solvent-exposed; additionally, there is only one such surface on many of the selected cluster representatives, which results in a limited number of residue positions from which to choose for variation. finally, if the natural binding surface of the drp is known, the residues in this region should also be considered as candidates to vary through phage display as has been done previously  <cit> .

additionally, while we have identified a set of diverse scaffolds, the utility of our protocol increases if the varied surfaces themselves are structurally diverse as well. this property is illustrated in fig. 5a-c, where the selected surfaces on particular drps are composed of different combinations of secondary structures, including loops, helices, and sheets. we suggest these varied surfaces would be diverse across scaffolds even if surfaces were selected randomly on each drp; there is little structural overlap across the full length of the scaffolds, and thus there is likely to be little overlap across subsets of the scaffolds. an exception is the α- and β-defensins, where the β-class includes an n-terminal helix not present in the α-class, with the remainder of the peptide chains being structurally similar . thus, the β-defensin varied surface could include this helix to ensure it is structurally distinct from the α-defensin surface.

these considerations were applied to design three phage libraries based on selected cluster representatives. different secondary structures were accounted for, and regions from discontinuous surfaces were varied to increase the binding footprint . no enrichment was observed from panning the 1katr <dig> and 1kvfr <dig> libraries against il- <dig>  this result demonstrates the drawback of relying on a single phage library to produce hits using a generic panning strategy. it is likely that none of the sequences produced through phage variation had structural complementarity to il- <dig> and the phage library would thus not produce a positive result regardless of the sequence diversity sampled. in contrast, panning 1zdcr <dig> resulted in a modestly potent 3 μm hit. thus, even though the theoretical sequence diversity is similar across the three libraries, only 1zdcr <dig> yielded hits in a generic panning strategy, which illustrates the value of presenting sequence diversity in different topological shapes, particularly in those that confer the favorable chemical and biological stability of drps.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed an automated protocol for clustering drps and applied it to group  <dig>  peptides into  <dig> clusters, with 85% of those drps falling into only  <dig> most populous clusters. given the likelihood that diverse drp sequences assume a limited number of folds, similar to proteins as a whole, these  <dig> clusters appear to reflect the structure and function of the majority of drps found throughout nature. constructing phage libraries comprising  <dig> sequences displayed in topologically distinct conformations  and panning these libraries could result in binders that disrupt protein-protein interactions associated with disease. collectively, these libraries sample immense chemical space displayed in well-defined discontinuous surfaces that are composed of distinct combinations of secondary structures. by binding to flat protein interfaces, peptides derived from these libraries represent a promising alternative to the traditional monoclonal antibody approaches, particularly when considering their non-immunogenic character  <cit> , protease stability  <cit>  and potential for oral delivery  <cit> . the usefulness of our approach has been demonstrated by the identification of a μm binder from the initial panning of phage libraries based on only three scaffolds against the il- <dig> target.
