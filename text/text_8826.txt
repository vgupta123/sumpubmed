BACKGROUND
hydra is a freshwater polyp that belongs to cnidaria, a sister group to
bilateria   <cit> . hydra anatomy is organized as a tube with an oral-aboral axis
consisting of two cell-layers and three populations of stem cells . since the discovery of hydra regeneration in the
mid xviiith century, hydra provides a unique model system to
study how exogenous perturbations can reactivate a developmental program in an adult
organism . indeed, hydra possesses the amazing ability to regenerate any
missing part upon bisection of its body column. to dissect the genetic cascades
supporting regenerative processes, a complete report of the genetic toolkit
expressed in this animal is necessary. among cnidarians, genomic data are currently
available from three species, hydra magnipapillata <cit> , nematostella vectensis   <cit>  and acropora digitifera   <cit> . transcriptomic data are available from the colonial hydroid
hydractinia equinata <cit> , from the jellyfish clytia haemispherica <cit> , from the coral acropora millepora <cit>  and from two distinct hydra strains that belong to the
heterogeneous vulgaris group  <cit> . in addition, two sets of putative transcripts, called here pred-ca and
pred-rp, have been predicted from the hydra magnipapillata genome  <cit> . in spite of these efforts, the transcriptome of hydra is still
incomplete.
phylogenetic tree of opisthokonts was drawn according to  <cit> . together with ctenophores, cnidarians form the coelenterate
superphylum. coelenterates together with bilaterians constitute eumetazoa,
whereas porifers  occupy a sister group position within metazoa.

magnipapillata   <cit> , a rnaseq- <dig> transcriptome was produced from h.
vulgaris aep   <cit>  and this study presents a rnaseq illumina- <dig> transcriptome from
h. vulgaris basel .

to produce a hydra transcriptome that would account for a high proportion of
full-length rna sequences, we combined two widely used high-throughput sequencing
pipelines, developed by illumina  <cit>  and  <dig> life sciences  <cit>  respectively. the illumina technology produces shorter reads  at a lower cost per base than the longer reads  produced by
the roche  <dig> titanium technology. beside these differences, the two technologies
differ by the type of errors they generate, mostly base substitutions in illumina,
and micro-insertions or deletions in  <dig> homopolymer stretches  <cit> , although the overall error rate is much lower in assemblies generated
using illumina reads, partly due to higher coverages  <cit> . consequently assemblies of  <dig> rnaseq reads frequently contain
frameshift errors, which lead to truncated proteins after conceptual translation.
despite sustained progress in the field, no single standard assembly procedure
mixing reads of different technologies has yet met general agreement. here, we
reasoned that whenever illumina and  <dig> sequences corresponding to a transcript were
available, illumina-derived contigs  were to be selected in priority for building consensus stretches. to
reflect this choice, we adapted a method that was previously used to assemble
illumina contigs to  <dig> reads  <cit> . thanks to this strategy, we produced a hydra transcriptome that
contains 48’ <dig> unique transcripts, including 10’ <dig> novel sequences.
then, we performed a systematic comparative analysis of the rnaseq and
genome-predicted transcriptomes.

RESULTS
production of an extensive transcriptome from illumina and  <dig> reads
we produced a hydra rnaseq transcriptome by combining  <dig> and illumina
reads obtained from the hydra vulgaris strain “basel”. this
european strain is very closely related to the japanese strain hydra
magnipapillata <cit> , and they both belong to the vulgaris group
. in fact, those two strains are
hardly differentiable at the molecular level and are distinguished based on
their geographical origin  <cit> . the comparison of the hydra vulgaris “basel”
sequence data produced in this study to the hydra magnipapillata
genomic sequences  <cit>  typically resulted in 1% or less differences at the nucleotide level
. to increase the
odds of capturing gene specifically expressed during regeneration for subsequent
studies, cdnas libraries were prepared mostly from regenerating hydra
. the size distribution of the 454
and illumina reads that we obtained is shown in figure 2a, 2b, respectively.

b) left panel: percentages of mrna taken from hydra in
intact and regenerative conditions, as deduced from their respective
number of reads sequenced. right panel: length distribution of illumina
reads after barcode removal and adapter trimming.

to increase the strength of the illumina contigs against the  <dig> reads, we first
performed an initial assembly of the illumina reads into contigs using
velvet/oases . then in the course of the
subsequent assemblies, we performed the following manipulations : 1) illumina contigs were duplicated ; 2) artificial base qualities were generated.
finally, contigs longer than  <dig> nt were chopped into  <dig> nt with  <dig> nt
overlapping segments to accommodate a requirement of the newbler assembler. the
resulting sequences were used as input for mira  and newbler
 assemblies along with  <dig> reads .
 and genome-assisted
 hydra transcriptomes. a, b) schemes
showing the de-novo  assembly process of
hydra rnaseq reads , and the genome-assisted 
and “best of”  assembly processes of hydra
transcriptomes . numbers of sequences are indicated at each
step. for steps 2a and 2b, artificial phred quality values were produced
for the dataset called “contigs” and the sequences were
duplicated in order to further correct frameshifts due to  <dig> sequencing
.

the outputs of mira-dn and newbler-dn were then joined using a
second round of mira assembly with similar parameters . occasionally, meta-dn contained longer coding
sequences than the two original datasets and those sequences were retained . the de-novo assembly was complemented by
a genome-assisted  assembly . with the
ga procedure, and in contrast to the de-novo procedure, very
short overlaps  between rnaseq reads that can be mapped
unambiguously to the genome are sufficient to expect contiguity and assemble
reads into contigs. thus, in the case of transcripts with low coverage, the ga
assembly procedure frequently leads to more contiguous sequences when the
transcribed regions are available from the genome.

the ga assembly consisted in the independent mapping of the  <dig> and the illumina
reads to the genome. the cufflinks software  <cit>  was then used to reunite the results of both mappings in a single
summary file, and the sequences of the modeled transcripts were extracted . similarly to the de-novo assembly process, a
second round of assembly was performed using mira with this dataset  and the longest open reading frames  were retrieved for each
genome-assisted sequence . finally, a dataset reuniting the
sequences with the longest orfs that were found among the de-novo or
genome-assisted assemblies was retrieved . this hydra-bo dataset
contains 48’ <dig> sequences, 45’ <dig> of which are longer than  <dig> nt
and have been deposited at the european nucleotide archive  under the
accessions haac01000001-haac <dig> 

production of an hybrid rnaseq/genome-predicted transcriptome 
and saturation analysis
to evaluate the complexity present in the illumina reads against a comprehensive
hydra transcriptome that might be used as a reference for further
studies, the hydra-bo transcriptome was pooled with genome-predicted
datasets ,
resulting in a non-redundant set of contigs that contains a mixture between
rnaseq and genome-predicted sequences . subsets of randomly
chosen illumina reads were mapped onto the hydra-meta dataset and the
number of reads mapped to each sequence was counted . of the 57’ <dig> sequences present in the
hydra-meta dataset, 7’ <dig> were never mapped with an illumina
read, pointing to insufficient illumina sequencing depth, or genes not expressed
in the condition tested. another possibility is that some of the predicted
sequences are a consequence of overprediction and are in facts never expressed
although this cannot be determined from our data. the number of sequences mapped
by  <dig> or more reads  exhibited saturation, as a random
subset containing 20% of all illumina reads was sufficient to target  <dig> % of
them. however, even if a large fraction of transcripts appeared to be detected
in this study, the fact that only 21’ <dig> contigs are mapped with  <dig> or
more reads indicates that the sequencing depth of the illumina dataset alone
 might be insufficient to assemble full length contigs for weakly
expressed transcripts.
transcriptome. a) construction of the
hydra-meta transcriptome, which contains an unredundant
assembly of the hydra-bo and predicted sequences . b) saturation analysis of transcripts representation
 with increasing numbers of sampled reads . the
hydra-meta transcriptome was used as a reference. subsets
of randomly sampled illumina reads were collected and mapped to the
reference using bowtie. the numbers of mapped reads  were counted
for each reference sequence.

gene number estimation
a rough estimate of the number of hydra genes based on transcripts only
was deduced from the number of sequences in each dataset associated with a
measure of the redundancies they contain. indeed, the presence of multiple
similar sequences in a dataset, due for example to allelic or splice variants,
would lead to an overestimation of the number of genes if not corrected for
internal redundancy. to assess the presence of multiple near-identical sequences
within transcriptomes, we aligned the coding nucleotide sequences from each
dataset against its whole dataset using megablast  <cit> . the number of hits retrieved by each query sequence was counted and
a single value representing the average number of matches per query was
calculated. the measure, called the redundancy index , is an indication of
the redundancy of the considered transcriptome .

 and hydra magnipapillata
 transcriptomes. a) boxplot
representing the orf lengths  of the intermediary 
and final  assemblies of the genome-assisted 
and “best of”  transcriptomes. for
comparison see the distribution of orf lengths from the
aep- <dig>   <cit>  and predicted   <cit>  transcriptomes. open circles represent outliers. horizontal
bars represent, from bottom to top, minimum, lower quartile, median,
upper quartile, and maximum orf lengths . numbers at
the top indicate redundancy indexes. b) comparison of the sizes
of the coding sequences between the datasets shown in a and the pred-ca
transcriptome. the pred-ca coding sequences were aligned against each
sequence of every other dataset using blastn+ without low complexity
filter. first hits were retained if the alignment was uninterrupted for
more than  <dig> nt with at least 95% sequence identity. the sizes of the
matched and queried sequences were compared and classified into three
classes according to the size of the tested sequence : ≥ 100%
if larger or equal to the size of the corresponding pred-ca sequence
, between 99% and 75% , lower than 75% .
top numbers indicate the percentage of pred-ca sequences matched by the
transcriptome indicated on the x-axis. c) characteristics of the
hydra-bo, hydra-meta and aep-454
rnaseq transcriptomes. as hydra-bo and hydra-meta
contain exclusively sequences that are at least  <dig> coding nucleotides
long, the same criteria was applied to the aep-454
dataset. the last column indicates the number of full-length  orfs longer than  <dig> aas. d) number of functionally
annotated sequences in the rnaseq and genome-predicted transcriptomes
when analyzed with blastx+ , pfam or panther .

hydra-bo sequences retrieved  <dig>  matches on average, a ri value
significantly lower than those obtained for the genome-predicted transcriptomes
. as each hydra-bo sequence matches two
closely related sequences on the same set on average, we estimate the number of
hydra genes to be ~24’ <dig> . following the
same calculation rules, the number of genes fall to 4’ <dig> and 9’799
for the genome-predicted pred-ca and pred-rp transcriptomes and reaches
19’ <dig> with the aep- <dig> transcriptome  <cit> .

an independent estimate of the number of genes represented in the
hydra-bo, pred-ca, and pred-rp, was obtained by mapping their sequences
back to the genome and counting the number of expressed genomic loci. of the
three datasets, pred-ca yielded the lowest number with 16’ <dig> estimated
genes, and the pred-rp dataset had the highest estimate with 31’ <dig> genes.
for the hydra-bo transcriptome, we counted a total of 28’520
different expressed loci. both numbers, 24’ <dig> based on transcript
redundancy or 28’ <dig> based on genetic loci exceed the number previously
predicted to be ~20’ <dig>  <cit> . however this initial number did not include pseudogenes or
transposons. therefore the 24’ <dig> to 28’ <dig> estimation is compatible
with the fact that the rnaseq transcriptome assembled here incorporates a large
share of all sequences expressed in hydra.

comparative analysis between the hydra-bo, aep- <dig>  and genome-predicted
transcriptomes
to compare the existing datasets, we first assessed their physical
characteristics, and next evaluated their respective functional content. the
lengths of the coding sequences of the hydra-bo, pred-ca and pred-rp
transcriptomes exhibit similar size distribution  except for a few sequences from the genome-predicted sets that
appear longer. by contrast the aep- <dig> transcriptome contains
a large proportion of small orfs . the lengths of the coding sequences of each dataset
were then compared to the length of the corresponding coding sequences found in
the pred-ca transcriptome . this analysis shows a progressive increase
in the length of the successive intermediary datasets, with the first assembly
 containing the shortest coding sequences and the final assembly
 containing the longest . over 60% of hydra-bo sequences display either equal or
longer coding length when compared to pred-ca sequences . finally, the hydra-bo
transcriptome contained more sequence representatives of pred-ca sequences than
any other dataset . in comparison, the aep- <dig> dataset captured
 <dig> % of the 32’ <dig> pred-ca sequences. the number of full length orfs
 longer than  <dig> amino acids  was
14’ <dig> for hydra-bo and 9’ <dig> for aep-454
. in contrast, the hydra-meta
dataset contains a much larger number of full length orfs .

to compare the content of the hydra-bo, aep- <dig>  and
predicted transcriptomes, blasts and functional annotations using pfam and
panther were performed . overall,
hydra-bo matched more sequences  and encoded more functional families than the three
other transcriptomes tested here . these gene families are listed in additional file  <dig>  we conclude that hydra-bo not only contains longer
sequences than aep- <dig>  but also encodes a greater diversity
of transcripts when compared to aep- <dig> and genome-predicted
transcriptomes.

unpredicted sequences in the hydra-bo rnaseq transcriptome
to identify the transcripts present in hydra-bo but absent from the two
sets of genome-predicted sequences, we aligned the hydra-bo sequences
to a pooled version of the predicted datasets. queries without hits  were
retrieved and counted . among
hydra-bo sequences, we found 38’ <dig>  sequences that were
common between the predicted and the rnaseq datasets but also 10’597
hydra-bo sequences that were missing in the genome-predicted
transcriptomes. the expression of a large fraction of these “rnaseq
only” sequences was actually confirmed , 2’ <dig> in ests, 1’ <dig> in the
aep- <dig> transcriptome. as a consequence, 6’836
rnaseq-only sequences remain completely novel. in a similar way, we found
11’ <dig> genome-predicted sequences missing in hydra-bo. among
these “predicted-only” sequences, 1’ <dig> were identified in
ests, 1’ <dig> in the aep- <dig> transcriptome, leaving
9’ <dig> sequences unique to the genome-predicted sets . all these sequences exhibit a low gc content
 that is typical for
hydra.
a) pie chart showing the distribution of the 10’597
hydra-bo sequences not found in the genome-predicted
transcriptomes, thus named “unpredicted”: 3’ <dig> align
to hydra ests and/or to sequences from the
aep- <dig> transcriptome whereas 6’ <dig> appear
novel. b) pie chart showing the distribution of the 11’270
genome-predicted sequences that were not found in the hydra-bo
dataset: 2’ <dig> align to hydra ests and/or to
aep- <dig> sequences but 9’ <dig> sequences do not
align to any expressed transcripts, thus named
“predicted-only”. c) number of reciprocal best hits
 identified among predicted-only  and unpredicted
 sequences when tested on a variety of opisthokont
species. rbhs occurrence was assessed for hydra-bo and
predicted transcriptomes in each species individually, using whole
proteomes and whole deduced proteomes. predicted-only and unpredicted
sequences corresponding to rbh orthologs were then extracted.

to verify whether the 10’ <dig> rnaseq-only transcripts are indeed
corresponding to hydra genes, we aligned them to genomic sequences
allowing for a greater level of mismatches than in the previous analysis  . 9’ <dig> sequences  aligned to the genomic
sequences with more than 75% identity. the 10’ <dig> rnaseq only transcripts
were then aligned to proteins deduced from the full genome-predicted
transcriptomes using blastx+ . 4’ <dig>  transcripts were reliably mapped to
genome-predicted proteins . the protein-alignments
conservation ranged from 20% to 100% with an average of  <dig> %, indicating that
some rnaseq only transcripts probably correspond to paralogs of predicted
sequences, whereas a large number of them share only low sequence identity and
thus likely encode proteins not represented in the predicted datasets.

finally, we compared the length of the orfs of the rnaseq only and predicted only
datasets . we noted a
significant difference as the rnaseq only set contains shorter coding sequences
with only 3’ <dig>  encoding proteins longer than  <dig> amino acids
versus 8’ <dig>  in the genome-predicted only set. in summary, both
datasets of transcripts seem to correspond to functional genes that encode
hydra proteins although with striking differences in terms of orf
length.

novel hydra-human orthologs identified among the rnaseq only
sequences
to characterize the proteins encoded by the rnaseq only and predicted-only
sequences, we performed reciprocal best hits , a procedure that provides a
powerful and reliable method to identify orthologs among large and multiple
sequence populations  <cit> . as a first step, we deduced the proteomes of the hydra-bo,
hydra-meta, aep- <dig> and genome-predicted
transcriptomes, producing four distinct whole hydra proteomes. next, we
tested these four hydra proteomes against the proteomes of  <dig> species
representative of non-metazoan , basal
metazoan , basal eumetazoan  as well as bilaterian
 phyla . we detected a similar numbers of pairwise
orthologs in the hydra-bo, the hydra-meta and the
genome-predicted proteomes, although slightly higher in the hydra-meta
dataset. by contrast the number of orthologs retrieved from the
aep- <dig> proteome was consistently lower in all species as
anticipated from previous analyses.

similarly we retrieved the rbh orthologs present in the rnaseq only and
predicted-only datasets from rbh computed on whole proteomes . in both datasets, this analysis identified low numbers
of orthologous proteins,  <dig>  among the predicted-only sequences and 529
 in the rnaseq only dataset . this
result suggests that a large fraction of these two gene datasets encode
hydra-specific proteins, and might thus be considered as
taxon-restricted genes  <cit> . nevertheless, we identified  <dig> novel orthologs to human proteins
among novel hydra sequences . the
annotations of the human proteins point to a variety of molecular and cellular
functions, encompassing cellular signaling  including rbh-orthologs to two
distinct fgf proteins, but also membrane proteins , cell metabolism 
including rbh-orthologs to ltor <dig>  ltor <dig>  to cytochrome c oxidase assembly
proteins  <dig> and  <dig> , post-translational modifications , vesicle
and protein transport  including a rbh-ortholog to synaptotagmin, cell cycle
regulation , protein biosynthesis , dna-binding activity and
transcription  including rbh-orthologs to atf <dig>  rpa <dig>  thap <dig>  cytoskeletal
organization , lipid metabolism , chromatin regulation ,
cell death , dna repair and telomeres , meiosis and gametogenesis ,
immunity and inflammation  including rbh-orthologs to nlrp <dig>  nlrp <dig>  nlrp14
but also  <dig> proteins with unknown functions in human .
orthologs.  <dig> hydra proteins were selected after rbhs
with the human proteome . the names and
predicted functions of these proteins were deduced from the annotation
of the corresponding human othologs . the phylogenetic relationships were tested for  <dig> of
them  and confirmed in all cases . underlined names
correspond to genes whose expression was tested in rt-pcr , confirmed in all cases,
cloned and sequenced.

the phylogenetic relationships obtained by rbh were verified for  <dig> proteins,
including the chromatin regulators bmi <dig>  meaf <dig>  pcgf <dig>  prmt <dig>  k <dig>  the kinase
dolk, the phosphatase pgp, the mitochondrial synthase fpgs, and orthology was
confirmed for all of them . finally we checked that these novel genes
are indeed expressed in hydra. we randomly picked a subset of them
, successfully amplified all of them from cdna  and confirmed by cloning and sequencing
their nucleotide sequence . hence
the rnaseq only dataset contains a large number of expressed genes thus far
never identified. some of them are conserved between evolutionarily-distant
species, and the human annotation suggests a functional role in a variety of
molecular and cellular processes.

a large population of unpredicted transcripts with short orfs and
pseudogenes
from the 10’ <dig> rnaseq only contigs, 7’ <dig> encode putative orfs
shorter than  <dig> residues with an average length of  <dig> coding nt. the
profile of the fraction of their coding lengths over their total length
shows that 2’ <dig> of these contigs have an orf spanning over ≥95%
of their length . the vast majority of
these contigs actually correspond to truncated fragments of longer coding
units, which were nevertheless not described so far . to confirm the expression of rnaseq only
sequences,  <dig> rnaseq transcripts never identified in any other dataset were
selected and all were successfully amplified by rt-pcr .
rnaseq only novel hydra gene families.
a) graph showing the proportion of the sequence covered by
the orf among the genome-unpredicted 7’ <dig> rnaseq transcripts
that encode short orfs . 2’ <dig>  transcripts
encode orfs that cover >98% of their full length. b)
nucleotide sequence length of the transcripts analyzed in a:  <dig> are
larger than 1’ <dig> nt long . the  <dig> largest contigs
were tested by rt-pcr and all were successfully amplified . see additional file 1: figure s <dig> 
c) rt-pcr analysis of the expression of 25
genome-predicted hydra transcripts not confirmed by rnaseq.
to distinguish between gene and transcript amplification, pcr were
performed on total rna treated  or not  with dnase  and
reverse transcribed  or not . d) the rnaseq only
genes , were sorted into three classes
according to the presence  or the absence  of
the criteria specified above the first row. the expression of 18
sequences of class i and  <dig> sequences of classes ii, iii and iv was
tested by rt-pcr.

beside these short transcripts encoding short orfs, we also noticed a subset
of long contigs that encode short orfs. indeed we found  <dig> transcripts that
extend from  <dig> bp up to 3’ <dig> bp but encode orfs shorter than 100
residues . we tested the expression of
the  <dig> longest of these contigs by rt-pcr and  <dig> out of the  <dig> were
successfully amplified . these transcripts might correspond to long
non-coding transcripts  although typical secondary structures found
in ncrnas could not be detected . however, when these
sequences were tested using blastx+, we found that  <dig> of them hit on several
locations a unique long protein sequence most often from hydra, but
also from nematostella or even from bilaterian species . this result suggested that these long
contigs with short orfs actually correspond to proteins fragmented by
numerous mutations leading to stop codons. as these contigs align perfectly
on the genome, we could exclude errors during the assembly process. we then
searched systematically for this type of rnaseq only transcripts, i.e. that
would satisfy both criteria, a perfect match on genomic sequences and no
good match with genome-predicted transcripts ,
indicating that they were arising from other loci. on the 4' <dig> rnaseq-only
with short orfs that do not span their full length, 3' <dig> sequences
perfectly align to the genome .  <dig> of those
align to predicted sequences with less than 95% sequence identity. this
number of  <dig> pseudogenes is likely an underestimate given the stringency of
the criteria used here.

genome-predicted genes can be active or silent
to test the expression of genome-predicted sequences, we selected 25
genome-predicted transcripts that fulfilled the following criteria: not
represented in any transcript dataset , but matching a jellyfish ortholog that
would be expressed among the clytia est dataset . the rt-pcr experiment was performed in
conditions that ruled out any genomic contamination, i.e. rna treated with dnase
or not, pcr amplification performed on rna and on cdna . among the  <dig> genome-predicted only sequences tested
that way, we could convincingly amplify  <dig> of them , indicating that a large proportion of these genome-predicted
only sequences are indeed expressed in homeostatic and/or regenerating
conditions in hydra polyps. but this result also points to the 8/25
sequences that could not be amplified, and thus are expressed at a very low
level or not expressed at all in adult, budding or regenerating hydra
polyps. this result would need confirmation at a larger scale but if confirmed
would allow screening strategies where genes active in jellyfish and silent in
hydra could be identified. such approaches could for example be
useful to help characterizing genes involved in the aplanulata transition, i.e.
when hydrozoan embryos lost the planula stage and became direct developpers,
when hydrozoa polyps lost the potential for budding medusae and thus
dramatically modified their life cycle.

discussion
a powerful strategy to generate extensive and accurate transcriptomes
this study describes novel strategies to combine two widely used high-throughput
sequencing technologies, illumina and  <dig> rnaseq, in order to compensate for
their specific errors and to produce accurate transcriptomes. here we applied
these strategies to rnaseq transcripts of the freshwater cnidarian
hydra resulting from the assembly of  <dig>  millions illumina short
reads to  <dig>  million  <dig> titanium longer reads. as each assembly has its own
specificities, in particular with respect to homopolymer errors, the sequences
from several datasets were pooled, and the sequences with the longest orfs among
nearly identical transcripts were selected. this selection ensured that
duplicated sequences, either partial or containing frameshifts were discarded
from the dataset when a longer sequence was present. this study shows that the
combination of different rnaseq methodologies provides an efficient and
cost-effective strategy for further characterizing gene diversity in species
where a finished genome is not available. in particular, homopolymer errors were
effectively suppressed by our strategy. in turn, in giving priority to illumina
over  <dig> sequences, it is possible that some substitution-type illumina
sequencing errors are introduced although illumina contigs generally exhibit
lower substitution errors than  <dig> ones as well  <cit> .

the rna-seq transcriptome we established for the freshwater cnidarian
hydra fulfills several criteria for high fidelity when compared to
other published transcriptomes, as evidenced by the different criteria used to
compare them; namely the total number of transcripts including the presence of a
large batch of novel transcripts, the length of these transcripts and their
redundancy. these characteristics will be helpful to study the regulation of
alternative splicing in developmental and stress contexts  <cit> . finally, we took advantage of the genomic-derived sequences to
extend and complete the rnaseq transcriptome. we now estimate that the
hydra transcriptome contains approximately 24’ <dig> unique
genes.

as novelties, genes encoding evolutionarily-conserved proteins and short orfs
in hydra
as a result of the comparative analysis we conducted between the genome-predicted
transcriptomes  <cit> , the aep- <dig> rnaseq transcriptome  <cit>  and the hydra-bo rnaseq transcriptome reported here, we
identified 10’ <dig> novel sequences in the hydra vulgaris rnaseq
transcriptome, most of them actually unpredicted but present in genomic contigs,
and  <dig> % found expressed either in the aep- <dig> transcriptome
and/or in ests. the rbh analysis of these rnaseq only sequences identified 529
evolutionarily conserved proteins with at least one ortholog among the other
tested species.  <dig> of these sequences show orthology with human proteins
annotated for molecular and cellular functions that can now be tested in
hydra. some protein-coding genes missing in the current version of
the hydra genome can be explained by its fragmented status, which
prevents the systematic prediction of the transcriptional units. however, and
quite surprisingly, a majority of these novel sequences encode short orfs
, which could not be predicted. a
fraction of these sequences possibly correspond to peptide coding units as
peptides are abundant in hydra <cit> , whereas some longer transcripts seem to be expressed as pseudogenes.
this result is of interest as pseudogenes are known to be submitted to gene
regulation and to regulate themselves the level of expression of coding genes
through a variety of mechanisms  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the rnaseq transcriptome produced in this study together with the genome-predicted
transcriptomes provides a solid reference for further molecular studies using
hydra as a model system. within cnidaria, this hydra
transcriptome together with the cnidarian transcriptomic and genomic sequences now
available from hydra <cit> , hydractinia <cit> , clytia <cit> , nematostella <cit>  and acropora <cit>  will help clarify the genetic sorting process that occurred along the
evolution of medusozoans and anthozoans, and thus provide a clearer picture of the
genetic equipment of the last common ancestor of cnidarians. moreover, the classical
hydra model system is nowadays used in a variety of research topics
such as regeneration, developmental processes, aging, stem cell biology, innate
immunity and ecotoxicology. the deep comparison between genome-predicted and rnaseq
transcriptomes offers new tools for phylogenetic reconstruction and should help
decipher the gene regulatory networks involved in these processes. this
econstitution is essential to highlight the outlines of the molecular pathways and
biological processes at work in tissues of bilaterian ancestors.
