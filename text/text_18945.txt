BACKGROUND
polyoxypeptin a  was isolated from the culture broth of streptomyces sp. mk498-98 f <dig>  along with a deoxy derivative named as polyoxypeptin b , as a result of screening microbial culture extracts for apoptosis inducer of the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma aspc- <dig> cells that are highly apoptosis-resistant
 <cit> . plya is composed of an acyl side chain and a cyclic hexadepsipeptide core that features two piperazic acid units . structurally similar compounds have been identified from actinomycetes including a83586c
 <cit> , aurantimycins
 <cit> , azinothricin
 <cit> , citropeptin
 <cit> , diperamycin
 <cit> , kettapeptin
 <cit> , ic101
 <cit> , l- <dig> 
 <cit> , pipalamycin
 <cit> , and variapeptin
 <cit>  . this group of secondary metabolites was named ‘azinothricin family’ after the identification of azinothricin as the first member in  <dig> from streptomyces sp. x- <dig> 

the compounds in this family exhibit diverse biological activities, such as potent antibacterial, antitumor
 <cit> , and anti-inflammatory activities
 <cit> , and acceleration of wound healing
 <cit> . both plya and plyb were confirmed to be potent inducers of apoptosis. they can inhibit the proliferation of apoptosis-resistant aspc- <dig> cells with ic <dig> values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/ml. they can also induce early cell death in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma aspc- <dig> cell lines with ed <dig> values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/ml, more efficiently than adriamycin and vinblastine that can’t induce death of aspc- <dig> cells even at  <dig> μg/ml
 <cit> . in addition, they are able to induce apoptotic morphology and internucleosomal dna fragmentation in aspc- <dig> cell lines at low concentrations
 <cit> .

polyoxypeptins  possess a variety of attractive biosynthetic features in their structures. the c <dig> acyl side chain may present a unique extension unit in polyketide synthase  assembly line probably derived from isoleucine
 <cit> . the cyclo-depsipeptide core consists of six unusual amino acid residues at high oxidation states, including 3-hydroxyleucine, piperazic acid, n-hydroxyalanine, 5-hydroxypiperazic acid  or piperazic acid , 3-hydroxy - 3-methylproline, and n-hydroxyvaline. the most intriguing is the hydroxylation at α-amino groups of the l-alanine and l-valine, different from that at terminal amino group of ornithine or lysine in siderophore biosynthesis
 <cit> . it is worth to note that  -3-hydroxy - 3-methylproline presents a synthetic challenge
 <cit> . both structural novelty and biological activity of polyoxypeptins have spurred much interest in understanding the biosynthetic mechanism and employing biosynthesis and combinatorial biosynthesis to create new polyoxypeptin derives.

here, we report the identification and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for plya based on the genome sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and systematic gene disruptions. the five stand-alone nonribosomal peptide synthetase  domains were confirmed to be essential for plya biosynthesis, putatively involved in the biosynthesis of the unusual building blocks for assembly of the peptide backbone. furthermore, three hydroxylases and two p <dig> enzymes were genetically characterized to be involved in the biosynthesis of plya. among them, the p <dig> enzyme plym may play a role in transforming plyb to plya.

RESULTS
identification and analysis of the ply gene cluster
whole genome sequencing of streptomyces sp. mk498-98 f <dig> using the  <dig> sequencing technology yielded  <dig> ,848 bp dna sequence spanning  <dig> contigs. based on the structural analysis of plys, we hypothesized that plys are assembled by a hybrid pks/nrps system. bioinformatics analysis of the whole genome revealed at least  <dig> nrps genes and  <dig> pks genes. among them, the contig <dig>  attracted our attention because it contains  <dig> putative nrps genes and  <dig> pks genes encoding total  <dig> pks modules that perfectly match the assembly of the c <dig> acyl side chain based on the colinearity hypothesis
 <cit> . moreover, orf <dig>  annotated as an l-proline-3-hydroxylase may be involved in the hydroxylation of 3-methylproline, one of the proposed precursor of plya
 <cit> . nrps analysis program revealed that  <dig> nrps genes encode a free-standing peptidyl carrier protein  ,  <dig> stand-alone thioesterase  domains , and  <dig> nrps modules that are not sufficient for assembly of the hexapeptide. therefore, we continued to find another relevant contig <dig>  contains  <dig> nrps genes encoding a free-standing adenylation  domain  and pcp , and  <dig> nrps modules. taken together, the total  <dig> nrps modules and  <dig> pks modules are sufficient for the assembly of plys.

to confirm involvement of the genes in these two contigs by disruption of specific nrps genes, a genomic library of streptomyces sp. mk498-98 f <dig> was constructed using supercos1
 <cit>  and ~ <dig> clones were obtained. two pairs of primers  were designed on the base of two hydroxylases  from the contig <dig> and contig <dig>  respectively, and used to screen the cosmid library using pcr method
 <cit> .  <dig> positive cosmids derived from the primer of plye and  <dig> positive cosmids derived from the primer of plyp were obtained. interestingly, these two sets of cosmids overlapped one same cosmid, 15b <dig>  which gave the further evidence that these two contigs belong to the same contig . thus, we used 15b <dig> as a template to fill the gap between these two contigs by pcr sequencing and got a  <dig>  bp contiguous dna sequence . subsequently, a nrps gene orf <dig>  was inactivated by replacement of plyh with apramycin resistant gene iv-orit) cassette in the genome of streptomyces sp. mk498-98 f <dig> . the resulting double-crossover mutant completely abolished the production of plya , confirming that the genes in this region are responsible for biosynthesis of plys.

bioinformatics analysis suggested that  <dig> open reading frames  spanning 75 kb in this region were proposed to constitute the ply gene cluster based on the functional assignment of the deduced gene products. among them,  <dig> modular type i pks genes  and  <dig> modular nrps genes  encoding  <dig> pks modules and  <dig> nrps modules are present for the assembly of the ply core structure . other  <dig> nrps genes  encode an a domain, two pcps, and three tes that are free-standing from the modular nrpss. they are suggested to be involved in the biosynthesis of nonproteinogenic amino acid building blocks.  <dig> genes  are proposed to be involved in the biosynthesis of a novel extender unit for pks assembly . there are  <dig> genes  encoding putative hydroxylases or oxygenases that are proposed to responsible for the biosynthesis of unusual building blocks or post-modifications . there are  <dig> abc transporter genes  and  <dig> putative regulatory genes . in addition, an aminotransferase gene  is located in the center of the ply gene cluster that is probably involved in the biosynthesis of the novel pks extender unit  .

anumbers are in amino acids.

upstream of the ply gene cluster, three genes, orf <dig> , orf <dig> and orf <dig>  encoding proteins with similarities to 3-dehydroquinate synthase, sugar kinase and nucleotidyl transferase respectively, seemingly have no relationship with the biosynthesis of plya. orf <dig> , adjacent to orf <dig>  is predicted to encode a protein with similarity to a transcriptional regulator, which may be involved in the biosynthesis of plys. downstream of the ply gene cluster, three genes, orf <dig> , orf <dig>  and orf <dig> encode proteins with similarities to lysr family transcriptional regulator, hypothetical protein rop_ <dig> and hypothetical protein rop_ <dig>  to prove that the genes beyond this cluster are not related to ply biosynthesis, we inactivated orf <dig> and orf <dig>  the resulting mutants have no effect on the plya production , indicating that the  <dig> orfs-contained ply gene cluster is responsible for the plys biosynthesis.

assembly of the c <dig> acyl side chain by pkss
within the ply cluster,  <dig> modular type i pks genes  encode four pks modules, the organization of which is accordant with the assembly of the c <dig> acyl side chain of plya via three steps of elongation from the propionate starter unit . both plyt and plyw consist of ketosynthase , acyltransferase , and acyl carrier protein . however, the active site cys  of the plyt-ks is replaced with gln , so it belongs to the so called “ksq” that often occurs in the loading module of pks system
 <cit> . therefore, plyt acts as a loading module for formation of the propionate starter unit by catalyzing decarboxylation of methylmalonyl group after tethering onto acp . the conserved regions of at domain including the active site motif ghsqg
 <cit>  in both plyt and plyw , along with substrate specificity code 
 <cit>  indicate that both ats are specific for methylmalonyl-coa, consistent with the structure of the side chain of plya . in plyu, in addition to ks, at, and acp domains, a dehydratase  domain and a ketoreductase  domain are present. however, the dh domain here is believed to be nonfunctional because the key amino acid residue h of the conserved motif hxxxgxxxxp
 <cit>  is replaced by gln . the conserved motif of plyu-at for substrate selectivity is vpgh, neither including the serine residue in yash for methylmalonyl-coa nor phenylalanine residue in hafh for malonyl-coa . these changes may broaden the substrate binding pocket and enhance hydrophobicity of the substrate binding pocket, supporting that plyu is able to recognize 2-malonyl  <dig> as an unusual extender unit . compared to plyu, plyv contains an active dh domain and an enoyl reductase  domain. the conserved motif  of plyv-at signifies it specific for malonyl-coa as the extender unit . taken together, plytuvw seem to be sufficient for the assembly of the c <dig> acyl side chain of plya.

biosynthesis of 2-malonyl extender unit 3
the structural analysis of plys and pks architecture suggest that an unusual pks extender unit 2-malonyl-coa  is required for the assembly of the c <dig> acyl side chain of plys. the biosynthesis of the 2-malonyl-coa  extender unit  <dig> would involve a reductive carboxylation mediated by a crotonyl-coa reductase/carboxylase  homolog. similar reactions have been reported for formation of ethylmalony-coa
 <cit> , 2-malonyl-coa
 <cit> , and hexylmalonyl-coa
 <cit> , as well as proposed for involvement of biosynthesis of cinnabaramides
 <cit> , thuggacins
 <cit> , sanglifehrins
 <cit> , germicidins and divergolides
 <cit> , ansalactams
 <cit>  and many other natural products. analysis of the ply cluster reveals orf <dig> encoding a ccr tgad homolog  that was proposed to be involved in the biosynthesis of hexylmalonyl-coa, an extender unit for the assembly of thuggacin
 <cit> . orf <dig>  adjacent to orf <dig>  encodes a protein shared 71% identity and 81% similarity with 3-oxoacyl-acp synthase iii from s. roseosporus nrrl  <dig>  the gene orf <dig>  located upstream of orf <dig>  encodes an acp that contains a catalytic motif dldldsl 
 <cit> . the presence of these two genes indicates that the extender unit 2-malonyl may be tethered to acp, not to coa. in study of the biosynthesis of isobutylmalonyl-coa extender unit for germicidins and divergolides, ccr, ksiii and hbdh  are transcribed in the same operon
 <cit> . orf <dig> and other three genes orf <dig> also constitute an operon . the genes orf <dig> encode α-keto acid dehydrogenase e <dig> component, e <dig> component β and α subunits, respectively, suggesting their involvement of the biosynthesis of  <dig> by reduction of the β-keto group . given that the previous feeding study with isotope-labeled precursor suggested this 2-malonyl unit derived from isoleucine via a transamination
 <cit> , we proposed that an aminotransferase is required for the formation of α-keto acid, as shown in figure 
2c. plyn is the only identified aminotransferase gene, so we constructed the Δplyn mutant by replacement of the plyn gene with the aaciv-orit cassette . however, Δplyn was found no effect on the plya production , so we assume that other aminotransferases may mediate this transamination for the incorporation of c <dig> unit of isoleucine into  <dig> .

assembly of the cyclodepsipeptide by nrpss
after the c <dig> acyl side chain is assembled by  <dig> modular pkss, it is transferred to 3-hydroxyleucine via an amide bond formation catalyzed by a nrps, thus initiating the assembly of the peptide core. within the biosynthetic gene cluster, there are  <dig> genes plyfghx encoding modular nrps proteins. both plyf and plyg consist of two modules with seven domains  . active epimerase  domains are present indicating that the amino acids activated by plyf-a <dig> and plyg-a <dig> should be converted into d-configuration. among the six nonproteinogenic amino acid residues, only two piperazic acid residues are d-configuration, so these two a domains  are proposed to recognize and activate l-piperazic acid  that was confirmed to be derived from l-ornithine
 <cit> . this assumption can be supported by the findings that plyf-a <dig> shares 52-59% identity and 64-69% similarity to plyg-a <dig>  ktzh-a1
 <cit> , and hmtl-a1
 <cit>  , and as well as the substrate specificity-conferring ten amino acids  are highly analogous to those of ktzh-a <dig>  and hmtl-a <dig> 
 <cit> . both ktzh-a <dig> and hmtl-a <dig> were proposed to recognize and activate l-piperazic acid
 <cit> . plyh contains five domains  with a thioesterase  domain present, indicating that plyh is the last module of ply nrps system and responsible for the release and cyclization of the peptide chain via an ester bond formation. it is striking that an active methyltransferase  domain  is present in the plyh
 <cit> , but no n-methyl group is present in the structure of plys. the presence of this m domain remains enigmatic. based on the ply structure analysis and nrps machinery
 <cit> , plyh-a is proposed to recognize n-hydroxyvaline  as its substrate, but not valine because its substrate specificity-conferring codon sequences  are significantly distinct from those found for valine-specificity 
 <cit> . subsequently, the whole sequence of plyh-a shows 76% identity and 83% similarity to that of plyf-a <dig>  indicating that plyf-a <dig> is specific for n-hydroxyalanine . these assignments are consistent with the amino acid sequence of the peptide core of plys. finally, according to the collinearity of the nrps modules and the building blocks of the nrps-derived products, plyg-a <dig> and plyx would be proposed to recognize and activate -3-hydroxy-3-methylproline  and 3-hydroxyleucine , respectively, although we can’t predict their substrates based on their substrate specificity codons . taken together, six nrps modules activate six non-natural amino acids, and the substrate recognized by each domain is exactly consistent with the structure of the cyclic depsipeptide of plys .

biosynthesis of nonproteinogenic amino acid building blocks
except for the modular nrpss, there are six discrete nrps genes present in the ply gene cluster , identified as an a domain , two pcp domains  and three te domains . to test whether these six free-standing domains were involved in the biosynthesis of plya, we constructed their disruption mutants by gene replacement with the aaciv-orit cassette . the mutant strains  completely abolished the production of plya , indicating that these  <dig> discrete nrps domains are essential for the plya biosynthesis. however, the Δplyy mutant strain still produced plya, but the productivity decreased in comparison with that of the wild type strain . therefore, plyy may act as a type ii te, probably playing an editing role in the biosynthesis of plya by hydrolyzing misincorporated building blocks. multiple sequence alignment reveals that plyy and typical type ii tes contain a conserved motif  and catalytic triad s/c-d-h that is consistent with hydrolytic function 
 <cit> . this catalytic triad is also present in plyi and plys, indicating the hydrolytic function of plyi and plys, as shown by figure 
2e and g.

the discrete nrps domains have been found in many nrps assembly lines responsible for the formation of nonproteinogenic building blocks
 <cit> . for example, the conversion of proline to pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid, which is a precursor for the biosynthesis of pyoluteorin, prodigiosin, and clorobiocin
 <cit> , occurs while proline is activated by a discrete a domain and covalently tethered in a thioester linkage to a t domain. since all the a domains of six modular nrpss in the ply biosynthetic pathway are proposed to recognize and activate nonproteinogenic amino acid building blocks, plycdqis are assumed to be responsible for the formation of several monomers of plys from the natural amino acids. given that we can’t predict the substrate based on the key residues of the substrate-binding pocket of plyc , we propose that plyc may activate multiple amino acids such as alanine and valine or leucine, and tether them to the corresponding pcps . after n-hydroxylation of alanine and valine  as well as β-hydroxylation of leucine , the matured building blocks are proposed to be released by discrete tes  and activated again by plyf-a <dig>  plyh, and plyx, respectively . such processes are rare events in typical nrps-driven biosynthetic pathways
 <cit> .

the depsipeptide core of plya is composed of  <dig> amino acids,  <dig> of which are hydroxylated. there are  <dig> genes encoding putative hydroxylases or oxygenases. for example, plyr encodes a cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase that shows high homology  to nikq that was demonstrated to catalyze β-hydroxylation of histidine tethered to pcp, so we could propose that plyr may be involved in the formation of β-hydroxyleucine building block . indeed, inactivation of plyr resulted in loss of ability to produce plya . given that fad-dependent monooxygenase cchb has been reported to catalyze the n-hydroxylation of the δ-amino group of ornithine in the biosynthetic pathway of the siderophore coelichelin
 <cit> , we proposed that plye, a fad-dependent monooxygenase, may be responsible for n-hydroxylation of alanine and valine when they are activated and tethered to a pcp by a domain plyc . the Δplye mutant lost ability to produce plya , indicating its possible role in formation of n-hydroxyalanine and n-hydroxyvaline. plyp, a l-proline 3-hydroxylase, should be responsible for hydroxylation of 3-methyl-l-proline that is biosynthesized from l-isoleucine demonstrated by isotope-feeding study 
 <cit> . inactivation of plyp indeed abolished the production of plya . recently, tang and co-workers have reported that an α-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase ecdk catalyzes a sequential oxidations of leucine to form the immediate precursor of 4-methylproline
 <cit> . in the ply cluster, the only gene plyo encodes an α-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase, but it doesn’t share any homology to ecdk. in contrast, plyo shows 48% identity and 64% similarity to phytanoyl-coa dioxygenase . it remains unclear whether plyo may be responsible for the hydroxylation of the carbon adjacent to the acyl group of the c <dig> acyl side chain or for the formation of 3-methyl-l-proline from l-isoleucine. orf <dig> encodes a fad-binding oxygenase or hydroxylase with high homology to type ii pks-assembled aromatic compounds hydroxylase . its role in biosynthesis of plya remains unclear, but it might be involved in the biosynthesis of a building block because its inactivation abolished the ply production .

piperazic acid is an attractive building block of many complex secondary metabolites such as antrimycin
 <cit> , chloptosin
 <cit> , himastatin
 <cit> , luzopeptin
 <cit> , quinoxapeptin
 <cit> , lydiamycin
 <cit> , piperazimycin
 <cit>  and sanglifehrin
 <cit> . the detailed biosynthetic mechanisms by which piperazic acid are formed are not well understood. recently, walsh and coworkers demonstrated that ktzi, a homolog of lysine and ornithine n-hydroxylases catalyzes the conversion of ornithine into piperazic acid in kutzneride biosynthetic pathway
 <cit> . no such a homolog was found in the ply gene cluster, but two putative homologs are located outside the ply gene cluster , suggesting that the biosynthesis of piperazic acid may follow the same pathway .

genes putatively for post-modifications
most modifications in plya biosynthesis take place for the formation of the non-natural building blocks. recently, ju and co-workers demonstrated that a cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase htmn catalyzes the hydroxylation of the piperazic acid after peptide formation
 <cit> . there are two cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase genes  in the ply cluster. plyr was proposed to hydroxylate leucine that is tethered to a pcp, so we would assume that plym may catalyze the hydroxylation of piperazic acid unit as a post-modification although it doesn’t show any homology to hmtn
 <cit> . to test this hypothesis, we constructed the double-crossover mutant by replacement of plym with the aaciv-orit gene cassette that is not producing plya , only accumulating plyb . these findings indicate that plym is responsible for the conversion of plyb into plya . to test whether other oxygenases or hydroxylases are involved in the post-modifications, the mass corresponding to the putative intermediate of plya lacking two hydroxyl groups was monitored for the mutant strains . this mass is only detected from the fermentation broth of wide type and Δplym strains , not from other mutant strains  indicating that the assembly of plya and possible intermediates is abolished. these data may support that these genes are involved in the formation of building blocks, not post-modifications. they also indicate that it is very likely to have two steps of post-hydroxylation modifications for maturation of plya . when and how the hydroxylation at the α-carbon of the c <dig> acyl side chain takes place are still unclear.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified and characterized the ply gene cluster composed of  <dig> open reading frames  by genomic sequencing and systematic gene disruptions. the biosynthetic pathway has been proposed based on bioinformatics analysis, the structural analysis of plys and genetic data. it was demonstrated that five discrete nrps domains are essential for the biosynthesis of plys and proposed their roles in maturation of three unusual amino acid building blocks. the proposed biosynthetic pathway for plys will open the door to understand the biosynthesis of this family of secondary metabolites and set a stage to explore combinatorial biosynthesis to create new compounds with improved pharmaceutical properties.
