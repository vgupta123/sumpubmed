BACKGROUND
the fern genus dryopteris adans.  is estimated to contain  <dig> to  <dig> species worldwide  <cit> . the circumscription of dryopteris has been controversial and various related genera have been included in and excluded from dryopteris . christensen  <cit>  divided dryopteris into seven subgenera, six of which belong to today’s thelypteridaceae. van alderwerelt van rosenburgh  <cit>  separated stenolepia alderw. from malaysian dryopteris. christensen  <cit>  also split stigmatopteris c. chr. from american dryopteris. later he  <cit>  gave up his earlier treatment and recognized dryopteris sect. stigmatopteris  c. chr. ching  <cit>  separated lithostegia ching from sino-himalayan dryopteris. later, lastreopsis ching  <cit>  and ctenitis  c. chr.  <cit>  were both separated from dryopteris. nothoperanema  ching was established by ching  <cit>  based on dryopteris subgen. nothoperanema tagawa  <cit> . thinking “ctenitis subgen. dryopsis ching”  to be more closely related with dryopteris, holttum & edwards  <cit>  described dryopsis holttum & p. j. edwards as a genus.

the phylogenetic positions of most of these genera have recently been clarified. stigmatopteris and ctenitis are both rather isolated within the dryopteroid lineage  <cit> , while megalastrum holttum, a relatively recent segregate of ctenitis, forms a clade with rumohra raddi and the paraphyletic genus lastreopsis <cit> . none of these genera are in fact closely related to dryopteris.

although the close affinity among some but not all of acrophorus c. presl, acrorumohra  h. itô, diacalpe blume, dryopsisdryopterisnothoperanema, and peranema d. don has long been noticed , it has been unclear exactly how they are phylogenetically related. in studying the historical biogeography of the species of hawaiian dryopteris, geiger & ranker  <cit>  sampled  <dig> species of dryopteris and found nothoperanema  to be embedded within a paraphyletic dryopteris. using rps4-trns sequence data of  <dig> chinese species of dryopteris and several related genera, li & lu  <cit>  reinforced geiger & ranker’s  <cit>  finding that nothoperanema  should belong to dryopteris and for the first time confirmed that acrorumohra  belongs to dryopteris as well. the inclusion of acrophorusdiacalpedryopsis, and peranema in dryopteridaceae was strongly supported by li & lu’s  <cit>  and liu et al.’s  <cit>  works based on rbcl and rbcl + atpb data, respectively. with relatively small sampling, both of the works also found that dryopteris is paraphyletic in relation to these genera plus acrorumohra.

to date, fraser-jenkins  <cit>  has carried out the most intensive taxonomic study on dryopteris worldwide, partly on the basis of early such work carried out by itô  <cit>  on the japanese species and by ching  <cit>  on species in china, the himalaya, and neighboring areas. fraser-jenkins  <cit>  recognized  <dig> species which he divided into four subgenera: d. subgen. dryopterisd. subgen. erythrovariae  fraser-jenk., d. subgen. nephrocystis  fraser-jenk., and d. subgen. pycnopteris  ching. he divided the former three subgenera further into  <dig> sections. in his series of studies of species of dryopteris in yunnan, china, lu  <cit>  proposed three new sections: d. sect. caespitosae s. g. lu, d. sect. chrysocomae s. g. lu, and d. sect. indusiatae s. g. lu, two of which were adopted by wu & lu  <cit>  in their classification of the  <dig> chinese species of dryopteris. the non-monophyly of d. subgen. dryopteris and d. subgen. pycnopteris has been detected by geiger and ranker  <cit>  and li and lu  <cit> , respectively, using dna sequences of one or two loci and with relatively small species-level sampling . based on analyses of seven plastid loci and  <dig> dryopteris species, sessa et al.  <cit>  rejected monophyly of eleven of fraser-jenkins’  <cit>  sections and three of the four subgenera. several additional sections have never been tested for their monophyly using molecular data.

the goals of this study include:  <cit>  vigorously testing the monophyly of dryopteris by including representative species of every subgenus and every section of dryopteris currently recognized and by including all controversially related genera;  <cit>  resolving phylogenetic relationships between dryopteris and acrophorus, acrorumohra, diacalpe, dryopsis, dryopteris, nothoperanema, and peranema;  <cit>  assessing the monophylies of supraspecific taxa at sectional and subgeneric ranks recognized in current classifications using relatively large sampling and dna sequences of multiple loci; and  <cit>  identifying major evolutionary lineages in dryopteris.

RESULTS
analyses of individual plastid regions
the characteristics and statistics of four individual plastid regions from mp and ml analyses are presented in table  <dig>  the four individual plastid regions as well as the combined trnl intron and trnl-f spacer yielded similar tree topologies in both mp and ml analyses . the most parsimonious, parsimony jk, and likelihood jk and bs trees for all analyses are available upon request from the first author. there were no well-supported  clades that conflicted with one another in both the parsimony jk and likelihood bs trees. therefore, the four plastid regions were combined. 

“pi” = parsimony-informative. “% miss. / inappl.” = percentage of cells in the data matrix scored as missing or inapplicable. “mpt” = most parsimonious tree. “mp” = maximum parsimony. “ml” = maximum likelihood. “jk” = jackknife. “bs” = bootstrap. “ci” = consistency index. “ri” = retention index.

analyses of combined plastid data
the combined data matrix of four plastid regions consisted of  <dig>  bases. a simultaneous analysis  <cit>  of nucleotides from all plastid regions was conducted as the primary basis for phylogenetic inference in dryopteris.

unweighted mp simultaneous analysis generated  <dig> , <dig> most parsimonious trees with a length of  <dig>  steps, a consistency index  of  <dig> , and a retention index  of  <dig> . the mp simultaneous analysis terminated prematurely when it was out of memory. the ml simultaneous analysis generated one optimal tree which is shown in figure  <dig>  the tree topology of the mp simultaneous analysis was similar to that from the ml simultaneous analysis and there existed no well-supported conflicts between the two trees. 

discussion
the monophyly and circumscription of dryopteris
our analyses showed that dryopteris in its current circumscription is paraphyletic in relation to acrophorusacrorumohradiacalpedryopsisnothoperanema, and peranema . this resolution is consistent with that of geiger & ranker  <cit> , in which only dryopteris and one species of nothoperanema were sampled. our finding is also in accordance with that of li & lu  <cit>  who sampled acrorumohradryopteris, and nothoperanema. sessa et al.  <cit>  found dryopteris to be monophyletic, but did not include representatives of any of these six genera in their sampling schemes. our study provides the first strong molecular evidence that the traditionally defined peranemataceae sensu wu  <cit>  and wu & ching  <cit>  , and acrorumohradryopsis, and nothoperanema, should all be merged into dryopteris, though each is monophyletic except acrorumohra. the expanded dryopteris is supported as monophyletic with strong support . interestingly, except for acrorumohra and nothoperanema, and despite the similarity among members of these genera, the study of li & lu  <cit>  was the first to suggest that dryopteris was paraphyletic with respect to acrorumohra, acrophorus, diacalpe, dryopsis , and peranamea. such a close relationship among all of them had not previously been suggested in the literature, although the close affinities among peranemataceae, dryopsis , and dryopteridaceae have partially long been noticed . morphologically, peranemataceae, dryopsisdryopteris, and nothoperanema share short rhizome and catadromic arrangement of frond segments.

resolution of peranemataceae
the family peranemataceae was established by ching  <cit> ; as “perenemaceae”] and is composed of acrophorusdiacalpe, and peranema <cit> . kramer  <cit>  recognized acrophorusnothoperanemaperanema , and dryopsis as independent genera, in addition to dryopteris and another  <dig> or  <dig> genera , in his large subfamily dryopteridoideae, one of the two subfamilies in dryopteridaceae sensu lato . recognition of these genera in dryopteridaceae was largely followed by smith et al.’s  <cit>  classification. it is clear now that dryopteridaceae sensu kramer  <cit>  are highly polyphyletic and contain the now separately circumscribed families athyriaceae, cystopteridaceae, dryopteridaceae, hemidictyaceae, hypodematiaceae, oncleaceae, tectariaceae, and woodsiaceae .

morphologically, peranemataceae can easily be distinguished from dryopteridaceae by having slightly raised receptacles and inferior indusia that are coriaceous and globose or membranaceous and semi-globose  <cit> . however, the two families have the same basic chromosome number, x =  <dig>  morphologically, they also share catadromic arrangement of frond segments. the family peranemataceae is generally not recognized in modern classifications . our study shows that peranemataceae sensu ching  <cit> , wu  <cit> , and wu & ching  <cit>  are not monophyletic because nothoperanema, normally not viewed as a member of peranemataceae, is embedded within peranemataceae. in our analyses, nothoperanema and peranemataceae together formed a strongly supported monophyletic group in our analyses , sister to the aemulae clade within dryopteris . our molecular data unambiguously resolved the species of peranemataceae as members of dryopteris .

resolution of acrophorus
the genus acrophorus has been recognized by numerous authors , but was not recognized by fraser-jenkins  <cit> , who synonymized it with peranema. acrophorus is characterized by having a cordate and often persistent scale at the bases of costae, membranaceous and semi-globose indusia, a few multi-celled septate clavate paraphyses on the lower portion of the sporangiate stalk, and a few short multi-celled clavate appendages on the margins of scales at the stipe bases  <cit> . acrophorus contains about  <dig> species occurring in southeast asia, westward reaching papua new guinea and polynesia  <cit> . six species are sampled in our study including the type, a. nodosus c. presl. acrophorus is strongly supported as monophyletic in our study . in the ml tree it is sister to diacalpe + nothoperanema, but this resolution received low statistical support. in the ml bs tree, it formed an unresolved trichotomy with diacalpe and nothoperanema . based on our study, acrophorus belongs to dryopteris, and represents a specialized group within dryopteris with round indusia and cordate scales at costa base.

within acrophorus, a. paleolatus pic. serm. is strongly supported as sister to the remaining species .

resolution of diacalpe
diacalpe is recognized by pichi sermolli  <cit> , wu  <cit> , wu & ching  <cit> , and christenhusz et al.  <cit> , but is synonymized with peranema by nayar & kaur  <cit>  who also included lithostegia ching in peranema. lithostegia has a close affinity with arachniodes as shown by liu et al.  <cit>  and our unpublished data. kuo  <cit> , kramer  <cit> , and smith et al.  <cit>  also treated diacalpe as a synonym of peranema. four species, including the type, d. aspidioides blume, are sampled in our study. our analyses show that diacalpe is strongly supported as monophyletic  and diacalpe and peranema are paraphyletic in relation to acrophorus and nothoperanema, contrasting nayar & kaur’s  <cit> , kramer’s  <cit> , and smith et al.’s  <cit>  treatments of diacalpe as a synonym of peranema while recognizing acrophorus. our resolution of diacalpe is consistent with liu et al.  <cit>  where only two species of diacalpe were sampled. morphologically, diacalpe is characterized by unstalked sori, a few single-celled long and clavate paraphyses on the lower portion of sporangiate stalk, and entire scales at the stipe bases  <cit> .

within diacalpe, d. annamensis tagawa is resolved as sister to the rest of species, with d. chinensis ching & s. h. wu then sister to d. aspidioides + d. christensenae ching .

resolution of peranema
with its two species occurring in tropical and subtropical asia  <cit> , the bitypic genus peranema is recognized by nearly all pteridologists . peranema is strongly supported as monophyletic in our study . this genus is morphologically distinguishable from diacalpe by having stalked sori, no paraphyses on the lower portion of sporangiate stalks, and a few short and single-celled clavate hairs on the margins of scales at the stipe bases  <cit> . synonymization of diacalpe with peranema, as done by nayar & kaur  <cit> , kramer  <cit> , smith et al.  <cit> , and fraser-jenkins  <cit> , is rejected by our data, which resolved peranema as sister to a clade containing acrophorusdiacalpe, and nothoperanema . although the morphological difference between dryopteris and peranema is striking, e.g., the presence of stalked sori in the latter, our data show that peranema, like other members of peranemataceae, should be merged into dryopteris.

resolution of acrorumohra
originally described as a subgenus, rumohra sect. acrorumohra h. itô  <cit> , and later elevated to a genus  <cit> , acrorumohra is now widely recognized , though fraser-jenkins  <cit>  subsumed it under dryopteris sect. nephrocystis  fraser-jenk. acrorumohra is well defined morphologically. its pinnules are all anadromous and the terminal pinnules have asymmetrical bases, different from dryopteris. ten accessions of three species of acrorumohra, including the type, a. diffracta  h. itô, are sampled in our study. our analyses demonstrate, for the first time, that acrorumohra is paraphyletic in relation to dryopteris polita rosenst. d. polita is sister to a. hasseltii  ching plus a. subreflexipinna  h. itô, and together these three are sister to a. diffracta. our results clearly show that acrorumorha is a member of dryopteris.

recently, acrorumohra subreflexipinna has been postulated to have arisen through recurrent hybridization between a. hasseltii and a. diffracta, with the former being its putative maternal parent and the latter its paternal progenitor  <cit> . our resolution of these three taxa  supports a. hasseltii as the maternal progenitor of a. subreflexipinna.

resolution of nothoperanema
tagawa  <cit>  originally described this taxon as a subgenus of dryopteris. ching  <cit>  elevated it to a genus. nothoperanema has been accepted at the generic level by many pteridologists . in contrast, itô  <cit> , copeland  <cit> , and ohwi  <cit>  regarded it to be part of ctenitis. smith et al.  <cit>  and christenhusz et al.  <cit>  treated it as part of dryopteris based on geiger & ranker’s  <cit>  findings. the most important morphological synapomorphy of nothoperanema is the presence of short and thick setae on each side of the costae and at the forking position of the midribs  <cit> . eleven accessions of four species are included in our sampling, including the type of the genus, n. squamisetum  ching. for the first time, nothoperanema is supported as monophyletic in our analyses , in contrast with li & lu’s  <cit>  resolution where nothoperanema was resolved as paraphyletic in relation to acrophorusdiacalpe, and peranema. our study also confirmed liu et al.’s  <cit>  finding that nothoperanema is embedded within a paraphyletic peranemataceae. this resolution is accordant with the general morphological similarities except for differences in the morphology of the indusia between nothoperanema and diacalpe/peranema <cit> . our study also reinforced geiger & ranker’s  finding that nothoperanema is nested within a paraphyletic dryopteris, and we conclude that nothoperanema should be a member of dryopteris. the two share similar reniform indusia, short rhizomes, and catadromic arrangement of frond segments.

within nothoperanema, n. diacalpioides ching, n. rubiginosum, and n. squamisetum together are strongly supported as sister to the remaining members of the genus. the relationship between n. hendersonii  ching and n. shikokianum  ching needs further clarifications.

resolution of dryopsis
the genus dryopsis was established by holttum & edwards  <cit>  based on “ctenitis subgen. dryopsis ching”. it is now widely recognized  <cit> , though the relationships among ctenitisdryopsis, and dryopteris have been controversial. morphologically, dryopsis appears to be more distant from ctenitis than from dryopteris. dryopsis has distinct venation on the abaxial surfaces, sori terminal on veinlets, and marginal, entire scales that are clathrate or not, but with long and dull areolae. ctenitis has venation indistinct on both the adaxial and abaxial surfaces, sori middle on the veinlets, and scales ciliate on their margins, clathrate, and with nearly hexagonal and lustrous areolae  <cit> . the major difference between dryopsis and dryopteris is that the former has either shallow or deep rachis and costa grooves that are closed near their bases, as well as multi-celled hairs with a thickened base on the margins but not in the grooves of the rachis and costae. dryopteris, in contrast, always has deep rachis and costa grooves that are connected near their bases, and normally has no hairs on the rachis or costae  <cit> .

dryopsis contains about  <dig> species  <cit>  occurring in tropical and subtropical asia and reaching southwestward to southern india and sri lanka, eastward to japan and the philippines, and southward to malaysia and indonesia. it is most diverse in the southern and southeastern himalaya  <cit> . with two species sampled, liu et al.  <cit>  discovered that dryopsis should be a member of dryopteridaceae but liu et al.  <cit>  failed to resolve the relationships among dryopsisdryopteris, and peranemataceae sensu ching  <cit> , and wu  <cit> . liu et al.  <cit>  also concluded that dryopsis is not closely related to ctenitis.

six accessions of five species of dryopsis, including the type, d. apiciflora  holttum & p. j. edwards, are sampled in our analysis. our results demonstrate that dryopsis is monophyletic , in contrast to the resolution of li & lu  <cit> , where three species of dryopsis formed an unresolved trichotomy with two species of dryopteris and one species of acrorumohra. our results also indicate that dryopsis is nested within a paraphyletic dryopteris , strongly suggesting that dryopsis should be subsumed into dryopteris. this resolution is not surprising given that the morphological difference between dryopsis and dryopteris is minute .

within dryopsis, the species sampled were resolved into two clades. morphologically, species of the upper clade  holttum & p.j. edwards, and d. sp.) have bullate scales, while those of the lower clade  holttum & p.j. edwards, d. mariformis  holttum & p.j. edwards) have flat scales .

monophylies of supraspecific taxa in dryopteris
our 100-species sampling is still not dense enough to rigorously test the monophylies of all supraspecific taxa  recognized in recent classifications by fraser-jenkins  <cit> , lu  <cit> , and wu & lu  <cit> , given that dryopteris s.s. contains between  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> species  <cit> , and in fact is even larger given that dryopsisnothoperanema, and peranemataceae should be included in dryopteris following our current work. however, our sampling allowed us to reject the monophylies of some supraspecific taxa because all four subgenera and  <dig> out of all  <dig> sections sampled  were represented by two or more species in our study .

the non-monophyly of the  <dig> out of the  <dig> supraspecific taxa in dryopteris strongly suggests that the current taxonomy of this genus is in need of revision. however, our data do not necessarily falsify the monophyly of these  <dig> sections. the disagreement between previous taxonomy and molecular results in dryopteris may be due partly to interspecific hybridization and polyplodization  <cit> .

there are four well-documented allopolyploids in dryopteris that have evolved via inter-clade hybridization, based on plastid trnl-f sequences, nuclear pgic sequences, and/or biochemical evidence. d. guanchica, limited to spain, portugal, and the canary islands, has been postulated to be of hybrid origin between d. aemula  and possibly d. intermedia   <cit> . the japanese endemic d. shibipedis sa. kurata, an obvious member of d. sect. variae judging from the morphology  <cit> , has possibly a hybrid origin between d. kinkiensis  and d. pacifica  tagawa   <cit> . using allozyme data jiménez et al.  <cit>  concluded that d. corleyi, an endemic of northern spain, is of hybrid origin between d. aemula  and d. oreades fomin . our analyses based on plastid data and the resolution of d. corleyi as sister to d. aemula suggest that d. aemula is the maternal progenitor of d. corleyi. in addition, sessa et al.  <cit>  found evidence of extensive hybridization among the new world species of dryopteris that has involved inter-continental long-distance dispersal as well as inter-clade hybridization. these examples of hybridization not only highlight the importance of reticulate evolution and thus the importance of nuclear data in understanding the evolutionary history of dryopteris, but also strongly support the inclusion of these  <dig> lineages, including the small segregates, within dryopteris, as opposed to breaking dryopteris into many small genera.

major evolutionary lineages in dryopteris
within the newly defined dryopteris , the  <dig> species included in the current study are resolved into the following  <dig> well-supported major clades based on our four-locus plastid data set . most of these major clades are also defined by morphological synapomorphies.

 <dig>  the nothoperanema clade : this clade contains species of peranemataceae sensu ching  <cit> , wu  <cit> , and wu & ching  <cit>  and nothoperanema. the potential morphological synapomorphies of this clade include the presence of non-glandular hairs and round and inferior indusia. the genus nothoperanema is defined by the presence of thick, stout, and reddish brown setae.

 <dig>  the aemulae clade : the aemulae clade, or the hawaiian glabra group  <cit> , contains two species, dryopteris aemula and d. corleyi, based on the current sampling. these two species are different enough morphologically to have been placed in different sections by fraser-jenkins  <cit> . our resolution of d. aemula is consistent with those of geiger & ranker  <cit> , juslén et al.  <cit> , and sessa et al.  <cit> . this is not surprising because d. corleyi, an endemic of northern spain, is thought to be of hybrid origin between d. aemula  and d. oreades fomin based on allozyme data . all three species of d. sect. aemulae sensu fraser-jenkins  <cit>  are included in our analysis, but they are resolved as polyphyletic, with d. chinensis and d. gymnophylla grouping with acrorumohra and d. polita. based on geiger & ranker  <cit> , juslén et al.  <cit> , and sessa et al.  <cit>  the aemulae clade may also include d. guanchica gibby & jermy, d. glabra  kuntze, and d. hawaiiensis  w. robinson, but d. guanchica is an allotetraploid  and d. hawaiiensis possibly an allotriploid  <cit> .

 <dig>  the acrorumohra clade : this clade contains species of acrorumohra and dryopteris chinensis, d. gymnophylla , and d. polita . the morphological synapomorphy is the flat scales in comparison with the dryopsis clade, the erythrovariae clade, and the variae clade. the gain of bullate scales is considered here as the morphological synapomorphy of the expanded d. subgen. erythrovariae including the acrorumohra clade, the dryopsis clade, the erythrovariae clade, and the variae clade.

 <dig>  the variae clade : the variae clade contains species of dryopteris sect. variae fraser-jenk. it is characterized by having slightly bullate-based scales and stiffly coriaceous lamina and pinnules with caudate apices and pointed lobes  <cit> .

 <dig>  the erythrovariae clade : this clade contains species of dryopteris sect. erythrovariae plus d. podophylla. it is characterized by having more bullate scales and herbaceous lamina and pinnules with acute apices and rounded lobes  <cit> .

 <dig>  the dryopsis clade : this clade contains species of the former genus dryopsis. the relatively moderate branch support may be the result of some missing sequence data for members of this clade. the potential major morphological synapomorphies are the rachis and costa grooves that are closed near their bases and the multi-cellular hairs .

 <dig>  the cinnamomeae clade : the cinnamomeae clade contains two species of dryopteris sect. cinnamomeae and one species of d. sect. purpurascentes in our current sampling. this clade is defined by having pinnules angled acroscopically and usually with narrower bases and having linear scales on stipe base  <cit> .

 <dig>  the crinales clade : this clade was named the hawaiian exindusiate group by palmer  <cit>  and it contains five hawaiian endemics, dryopteris crinalis  c. chr., d. mauiensis c. chr., d. sandwiciensis  c. chr., d. tetrapinnata w. h. wagner & hobdy, and d. unidentata  c. chr. the potential morphological synapomorphy is the absence of indusia  <cit> .

 <dig>  the pallidae clade : this clade contains some species of dryopteris sect. pallidae sensu fraser-jenkins  <cit> , e.g., d. aitoniana pic. serm., d. odontoloma  c. chr., d. pallida  c. chr. ex maire & petitm., and d. mindshelkensis n. pavl.  fraser-jenk.), and additional species from other sections, e.g., d. goldiana  a. gray, d. monticola  , d. oligodonta  pic. serm. , and d. tokyoensis  c. chr. , based our current sampling and juslén et al.  <cit> . the inclusion of d. odontoloma in this clade needs further study. this clade is weakly supported as sister to the crinales clade . in comparison with its sister, the pallidae clade has indusia, but the pallidae clade can be defined by having narrowly deltate-lanceolate leaves and stalked pinnules  <cit> .

 <dig>  the nephrocystis clade : this clade contains those species of dryopteris sect. nephrocystis sensu fraser-jenkins  <cit>  with catadromous arrangement of leaf segments. it is characterized by having asymmetrical bases of basal pinnae with basiscopic pinnules much longer, and by having stipe-base scales that are lanceolate or ovate-lanceolate and brown  <cit> .

 <dig>  the dryopteris clade : this clade contains large portion of species of dryopteris subgen. dryopteris sensu fraser-jenkins  <cit>  and wu & lu  <cit>  and is the most species-rich clade of the genus. most species of this clade have symmetrical pinnule bases  and are mainly distributed in the sino-japanese and sino-himalayan regions.

 <dig>  the lophodium clade : this clade contains species of dryopteris sect. lophodium fraser-jenk. and d. remota. the species of this clade share short-stalked pinnae, long-aristate ultimate segments, and minutely spinulose perispore sculpturing except d. remota <cit> .

 <dig>  the fragrantes clade : this clade contains one of the two species of dryopteris sect. fragrantes  seriz., d. fragrans  schott. our work shows that d. fragrans is outside of d. subgen. dryopteris where it was placed by fraser-jenkins  <cit>  and wu & lu  <cit> , a resolution consistent with that in geiger & ranker  <cit> . most notably, our data agreed with sessa et al.  <cit>  in resolving d. fragrans as sister to the rest of dryopteris, though our statistical support values were low .our data clearly show that the dryopsis clade is sister to the erythrovariae clade; these two together are sister to a clade containing the acrorumohra clade and the variae clade; these four clades together are sister to a clade containing the aemulae clade and the nothoperanema clade; and these six clades are strongly supported as monophyletic . the relationships among the remaining seven clades are resolved in the ml tree  but with weak  branch support.

CONCLUSIONS
the genera, acrophorus, acrorumohra, diacalpe, dryopsis, nothoperanema, and peranema, should all be merged into dryopteris. most species of these genera share a short rhizome and catadromic arrangement of frond segments, unlike the sister genus of dryopteris s.l., arachniodes.

the non-monophyly of the  <dig> out of the  <dig> supraspecific taxa in dryopteris strongly suggests that the current taxonomy of this genus is in need of revision. however, our data do not necessarily falsify the monophyly of these  <dig> sections. the disagreement between previous taxonomy and molecular results in dryopteris may be due partly to interspecific hybridization and polyplodization.

the  <dig> well-supported clades identified with our data represent  <dig> major evolutionary lineages in dryopteris that are supported by morphological synapomophies and may deserve circumscription as supraspecific entities within dryopteris.

materials and methods
taxon sampling
all four subgenera and  <dig> out of  <dig> sections of dryopteris recognized by fraser-jenkins  <cit>  and three additional sections  recognized by lu  <cit>  and partly by wu & lu  <cit> , were represented by two to  <dig> species each. the only sections sampled that were represented by one species are d. sect. purpurascentes fraser-jenk. and the monotypic d. sect. politae fraser-jenk. in total,  <dig> accessions representing  <dig> species of dryopteris s.s. were sampled, including all four subgenera and  <dig> sections in the current classifications of dryopteris s.s. by fraser-jenkins  <cit> , lu  <cit> , and wu & lu  <cit> .

to assess the phylogenetic relationships between dryopteris and acrophorus, acrorumohra, diacalpe, dryopsis, nothoperanema, and peranema, further included are eight accessions representing five  out of eight species of acrophorus,  <dig> accessions representing three  out of seven species of acrorumohra, seven accessions representing four  out of  <dig> species of diacalpe, six accessions representing five  out of  <dig> species of dryopsis,  <dig> accessions representing six  out of eight species of nothoperanema, and two accessions representing both species of the bitypic peranema. type species of all these six genera, acrophorus, acrorumohra, diacalpe, dryopsis, nothoperanema, and peranema, are included. in total,  <dig> accessions representing  <dig> species of the expanded dryopteris  are included in this study.

one species each of arachniodes blume, leptorumohra h. itô, and lithostegia ching of dryopteridaceae are used as outgroups based on liu et al.  <cit>  where arachniodesleptorumohralithostegia, and phanerophlebiopsis ching together were resolved as sister to a clade consisting of acrophorusacrorumohradiacalpedryopsisdryopterisnothoperanema, and peranema. all sequences used in this study together with their genbank accession numbers and/or voucher information are listed in appendix ii.

total genomic dna was extracted from silica-gel dried material or sometimes from herbarium specimens using plant genomic dna kits  and dneasy plant mini kits . the pcr protocols followed zhang et al.  <cit>  and ebihara et al.  <cit> . dna sequence data were obtained for four plastid regions, rbcl gene, rps4-trns spacer, trnl intron, and trnl-f spacer. the rbcl gene was amplified with primers f <dig>  and 1379r . the primers for amplifying rps4-trns intergenic spacer were derived from souza-chies et al.  and li & lu ttagttgttgag;  <cit> ). the trnl intron and trnl-f intergenic spacer were amplified using the primers fern  <dig>  and the universal primer f  of taberlet et al.  <cit> . amplified fragments were purified with tianquick mini purification kits  and exosap-it . purified pcr products were sequenced by invitrogentm  and bigdye® terminator v <dig>  cycle sequencing kit .

additional sequences were obtained from genbank and had originally been generated by geiger & ranker  <cit> , li & lu  <cit> , ebihara et al.  <cit> , de groot et al.  <cit> , juslén et al.  <cit> , and sessa et al.  <cit> . in total,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> sequences of rbclrps4-trnstrnl, and trnl-f, respectively, were included in our analyses. some  <dig> dna sequences are newly generated for this study .

molecular phylogenetics
the alignment of the rbcl data was manually obtained using microsoft wordpad. preliminary alignments of rps4-trns and trnl-f  data were obtained using the default alignment parameters in clustal x  <cit>  followed by manual adjustments. gap characters were coded as missing data.

equally weighted maximum parsimony  tree searches were conducted for each data matrix using  <dig> tree-bisection-reconnection  searches in paup* ver.  <dig> b <dig>  <cit>  with maxtrees set to increase without limit. parsimony jackknife  analyses  <cit>  were conducted using paup* with the removal probability set to approximately 37%, and “jac” resampling emulated. one thousand replicates were performed with  <dig> tbr searches per replicate and a maximum of  <dig> trees held per tbr search. in addition to the analyses of the four individual regions, mp and ml analyses of the combined trnl intron and trnl-f spacer were also conducted since these two linked regions are sometimes viewed as one locus.

mrmodeltest  <dig>   <cit> , a modified version of modeltest  <dig>   <cit> , was used to select the best fit likelihood model for maximum likelihood  analyses. the akaike information criterion  <cit>  was used to select among models instead of the hierarchical likelihood ratio test, following pol  <cit>  and posada and buckley  <cit> . the models selected were gtr + g , gtr + i , gtr + i + g , hky + g , and sym + i + g . the selected models and parameters estimated  were then used for tree searches from the respective data partitions. one hundred jackknife replicates were performed with one tbr search per replicate and a maximum of  <dig> trees held per tbr search. 

“g” = gamma distribution shape parameter  <cit> . “gtr” = general-time-reversible model  <cit> . “hky” = hasegawa-kishino-yano model  <cit> . “i” = proportion of invariable sites. “sym” = symmetrical model  <cit> . “ti/tv” = transition/transversion ratio.

the simultaneous ml analyses of nucleotide characters and ml bootstrapping  were performed using raxml-hpc <dig> on tg ver.  <dig> . <dig>  with  <dig> rapid bootstrap analyses followed by a search for the best-scoring tree in a single run.

monophylies of supraspecific taxa in dryopteris
our results show that none of the four subgenera, d. subgen. dryopterisd. subgen. erythrovariaed. subgen. nephrocystis, and d. subgen. pycnopteris  ching, are monophyletic. sessa et al.  <cit>  also rejected monophyly of these subgenera, except for d. subgen pycnopteris, for which they had insufficient sampling to test monophyly. in the current study, most of the members of d. subgen. dryopteris are resolved in the dryopteris clade, while others are placed in other major clades except the acrorumohra, dryopsis, erythrovariae, nothoperanema, and variae clades. members of d. subgen. erythrovariae sensu fraser-jenkins  <cit>  are resolved in the acrorumohra, erythrovariae, and variae clades, but these clades are paraphyletic in relation to the dryopsis clade as well as d. chinensis  koidz. and d. gymnophylla  c. chr. , and d. podophylla  kuntze . members of d. subgen. erythrovariae sensu wu & lu  <cit>  are resolved in the erythrovariae and variae clades. the non-monophyly of d. subgen. pycnopteris is consistent with li & lu’s  <cit>  finding based on rps4-trns data. of our three representatives of this subgenus, two fell in the dryopteris clade  c. chr. and d. sieboldii  kuntze), and one in the erythrovariae clade . our sole sequence of d. podophylla was derived from li & lu  <cit> . d. subgen. nephrocystis is not monophyletic because acrorumohra diffracta baker  c. chr.), a. hasseltii blume  c. chr.), a. subreflexipinna  ching , and d. futura a. r. sm., a member of d. sect. purpurascentes, are resolved in the acrorumohra clade and the cinnamomeae clade. wu & lu  <cit>  did not recognize d. subgen. nephrocystis.

our results also demonstrated that  <dig> out of the  <dig> sections currently recognized  <cit> , for which two or more species are sampled, are not monophyletic . only two sections, d. sect. cinnamomeae fraser-jenk. and d. sect. variae fraser-jenk., are resolved as monophyletic with our current sampling. this is at odds with sessa et al.  <cit> , which tested the monophly of eleven sections, including d. sect. cinnamomeae and d. sect. variae, and rejected the monophly of all. although these two sections are found to be monophyletic in the current study, the sampling for both was larger in sessa et al.  <cit> , and they are thus not likely to be monophyletic either. the  <dig> polyphyletic sections discovered in our study are:

dryopteris sect. aemulae fraser-jenk.: represented by d. aemula  kuntze , d. chinensis, and d. gymnophylla .

dryopteris sect. caespitosae s. g. lu: represented by d. alpestris tagawa  and d. fragrans .

dryopteris sect. dryopteris: this section sensu fraser-jenkins  <cit>  is represented by d. alpestrisd. filix-mas  schott, and d. sichotensis v. komarov .

dryopteris sect. fibrillosae ching: represented by d. affinis  fraser-jenk. subsp. borreri fraser-jenk., d. polylepis  c. chr., and d. rosthornii  c. chr. .

dryopteris sect. erythrovariae: this section sensu fraser-jenkins  <cit>  is represented by d. caudipinna nakai, d. championii  c. chr., d. cordipinna ching & shing, d. decipiens  kuntze, d. erythrosora  kuntze, d. gymnosora  c. chr., d. indusiata makino & yamam. , d. kinkiensis koidz. ex tagawa, d. nipponensis koidz.  makino following fraser-jenkins  <cit> ), d. ryo-itoana kurata, and d. simasakii  kurata and all are in the erythrovariae clade. if d. podophylla  kuntze, a member of d. subgen. pycnopteris, is included, this section sensu fraser-jenkins  <cit>  becomes monophyletic.

dryopteris sect. hirtipedes fraser-jenk.: represented by d. atrata  ching, d. commixta tagawa, d. conjugata ching, d. cycadina  c. chr., d. dickinsii  c. chr., d. handeliana c. chr., d. hangchowensis ching, d. lunanensis  c. chr., d. scottii  ching, d. stenolepis  c. chr. and d. tsutsuiana kurata, all of which are in the dryopteris clade. this section becomes monophyletic if d. rosthornii  and d. uniformis  are included.

dryopteris sect. indusiatae s. g. lu: represented by d. gymnosora  c. chr. and d. indusiata makino & yamam. .

dryopteris sect. lophodium  c. chr. ex h. itô: represented by d. amurensis christ, d. expansa  fraser-jenk. & jermy, d. intermedia  a. gray, and d. dilatata  a. gray . these four species are paraphyletic in relation to d. remota  druce, the type of d. sect. remotae. the close relationship between d. remota and species of d. sect. lophodium based on our plastid data shows that d. remota, a triploid, is possibly originated through hybridization with one of the species in d. sect. lophodium being the maternal donor.

dryopteris sect. marginatae fraser-jenk.: represented by d. aquilinoides  c. chr. and d. shiroumensis kurata & nakaike . they are resolved as paraphyletic in relation to the rest of the dryopteris clade.

dryopteris sect. nephrocystis: represented by acrorumohra diffractaa. hasseltiia. subreflexipinnadryopteris hayatae tagawa  c. chr. by fraser-jenkins  <cit> ), d. melanocarpa hayata  kuntze by fraser-jenkins  <cit> ), d. maximowicziana  c. chr. , d. sabae  c. chr., d. sparsa  kuntze, and d. yakusilvicola sa. kurata . the first three species are resolved in the acrorumohra clade while the rest are in the nephrocystis clade.

dryopteris sect. pallidae fraser-jenk.: represented by d. juxtaposita christ, d. lacera  kuntze, d. sublacera christ, d. uniformis  makino , d. odontoloma  c. chr., and d. pallida  c. chr. ex maire & petitm. .
