BACKGROUND
most vascular flowering plants have the ability to establish symbiotic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal  fungi  <cit> . the main benefit for the plant is improved uptake of water and mineral nutrients from the soil, particularly phosphate, in exchange for photosynthetically fixed carbon  <cit> . the mycorrhizal symbiosis has been also associated with increased resistance to pathogen infection and tolerance to abiotic stress in several plant species  <cit> . as a consequence, the am symbiosis is of tremendous significance in agricultural ecosystems.

the legumes medicago truncatula and lotus japonicus have been widely adopted as the reference species for studies of the am symbiosis. contrary to this, arabidopsis thaliana, the model system for functional genomics in plants, has no mycorrhization ability. rice, a monocotyledonous plant with a completely sequenced genome, establishes symbiotic associations with mycorrhizal fungi  <cit> . as compared to the model legume species, the genes responsible for the am symbiotic interaction in rice are less characterized.

successful symbiosis with am fungi relies on the fine tuning and appropriate control of host gene expression and physiological responses. a molecular dialogue is early established between the host plant and the am fungus and prepares the two partners for the subsequent root colonization. signal exchange and communication starts prior to the initial cell-to-cell contact between the symbionts. thus, plant roots exude strigolactones which have an stimulatory effect on am growth  <cit> . fungal hyphae, in turn, produce diffusible molecules, the "myc factors" . very recently, it was reported that the am fungus secretes lipochitooligosaccharides which stimulate formation of am symbiosis in diverse plant species  <cit> . perception of myc factors by the host cells triggers a rapid and transient elevation of intracellular calcium, alterations in the cellular architecture and transcriptional reprogramming of the root  <cit> . even though both cytoplasmic  <cit>  and nuclear  <cit>  pre-infection ca2+ spiking responses are elicited in m. truncatula roots in response to am fungi, the mechanisms by which ca2+ alterations are sensed and transduced into early am-induced signaling remain unknown.

once contact between the symbionts is established, the fungus enters into the root through the epidermal cells, and penetrates into the cortex where it forms highly branched structures, called arbuscules, in the cortical cells of the root. the arbuscules are the site of the major nutrient exchange between the two symbionts  <cit> .

it is also known that the plant response to myc factors is mediated by a partially characterized signaling pathway which is required for the establishment of both rhizobial and am symbioses, the so called common symbiosis  pathway  <cit> . forward genetic analysis in the model legumes medicago truncatula and lotus japonicus has led to the identification of components of the sym signaling pathway. they are: a leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinase, the symrk protein in l. japonicus , two nucleoporins , two cation channel proteins , a calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase  and cyclops   <cit> . ccamk interacts with, and phosphorylates, cyclops in the nucleus  <cit> . in rice, the function of several sym genes appears to be conserved, including castor and pollux  and ccamk and cyclops   <cit> . evidence also support the existence of alternative, sym-independent signaling pathways controlling the early responses to am fungi in both rice and m. truncatula  <cit> .

transcript profiling of mycorrhizal roots allowed the identification of am-regulated genes in several plant species, including rice  <cit> . however, the majority of these studies focused on the mature phase of the symbiotic process, a period in which the host root is already colonized and arbuscules are developed in the root cortical cells. along with this, alterations in the expression of genes connected to nutrient acquisition processes, such as phosphate transporter genes, are well documented in different am associations  <cit> . genes involved in cellular modifications, transcriptional control and defense-related responses are also known to be regulated during the am symbiosis  <cit> .

even though alterations in ca2+ levels are known to occur in host cells during the presymbiotic phase, the decoding of the calcium signal is only poorly understood. on the other hand, it is well established that calcium-dependent protein kinases  are important ca2+ sensors in signaling processes during growth, development and stress responses in plants  <cit> . cpks belong to the cdpk/snrk superfamily of protein kinases and represent a differentiated group of protein kinases found in plants, algae and protists  <cit> . they possess a characteristic structure consisting of four domains: an amino terminal variable domain, a serine/threonine kinase domain, a junction autoinhibitory domain, and a c-terminal calmodulin domain. these features make cpks ideally structured to rapidly perceive alterations in intracellular calcium concentration and translating them into protein phosphorylation cascades. cpk functioning is, however, different from that of ccamk functioning, since cpks do not require calmodulin for their activation. ca2+ binds directly the calmodulin domain of cpks and induces a conformational change resulting in kinase activation  <cit> . the available information on plant cpks from various plant species indicates that they are encoded by multigene families and that whereas some of the genes are ubiquitously expressed, others show a tissue-specific pattern of expression or are regulated by stress   <cit> .

knowing that ca2+ plays a central role in the am-induced signaling pathway, it was of interest to investigate to what extent cpks are involved in the am-induced signaling pathway. towards this goal, the expression pattern of seventeen cpk genes was monitored in rice plants that have been inoculated with the am fungus glomus intraradices. we provide evidence that the expression of two distinct cpk genes, the oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> genes, is rapidly induced during the presymbiotic phase of the rice/g. intraradices interaction. oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> gene expression is also activated by fungal-produced diffusible fungal signal. by using the laser microdissection  technology, oscpk <dig> expression was detected in cortical cells, but not epidermal cells, of the g. intraradices-inoculated rice roots. moreover, a plasma membrane localization of oscpk <dig> is here reported, the myristoylation site of oscpk <dig> being required for its plasma membrane localization. together, these findings support that oscpk <dig> might play a role during recognition of the am fungus by the host cells.

RESULTS
expression of cpk genes in am-inoculated rice roots
a genome-wide analysis of rice cpk genes identified  <dig> genes which are distributed into four phylogenetic groups   <cit> . moreover, a comparison of the rice cpk genes distinguished  <dig> closely related pairs which, most probably, have arisen via sequential duplication events, the oscpk1/ <dig>  oscpk2/ <dig>  oscpk3/ <dig>  oscpk4/ <dig>  oscpk5/ <dig>  oscpk7/ <dig>  oscpk8/ <dig>  oscpk11/ <dig>  oscpk21/ <dig>  oscpk24/ <dig> and oscpk25/ <dig> pairs  <cit> . based of the homology and phylogenetic relatedness among the rice cpk genes, we selected a subset of seventeen cpk genes representative of the four distinct phylogenetic groups of rice cpks in which at least one representative member for each pair of closely related cpk genes was present. the subset of genes assayed in this work included oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> from group i; oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> from group ii; oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> from group iii; and oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> from group iv.

the expression pattern of selected rice cpk genes and their transcriptional response to inoculation with the am fungus g. intraradices, were examined during the presymbiotic phase of the symbiotic process. a preliminary screening was carried out by semiquantitative rt-pcr experiments with rna samples obtained from whole rice roots that had been inoculated with fungal spores using the single sandwich method. total rna was isolated at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after inoculation of the rice roots with g. intraradices, as well as from mock-inoculated rice roots. many cpk genes were found to be expressed in rice roots and at different levels . among them, the oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> genes were expressed at the highest levels. moderate to low levels of expression were observed for oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig>  whereas oscpk <dig> transcripts were barely detected . the oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> genes showed expression profiles similar to those shown for oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig>  respectively . taken in the whole, the expression level of the various cpk genes here investigated appears not to be dramatically affected upon inoculation with g. intraradices, with the exception of oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> expression 

for a comparison, the expression of the known sym genes from rice, namely the ossymrk, ospollux, oscastor and osccamk genes, was also examined. this analysis revealed up-regulation of ossymrk, ospollux and osccamk in response to g. intraradices at  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-inoculation . the observed induction of these genes indicates that the host plant cells perceive and respond to the am fungus through the activation of the am-specific sym signaling pathway.

since rt-pcr analyses do not provide reliable quantitative data of gene expression, quantitative reverse transcription-pcr  was used to further characterize the effect of g. intraradices inoculation on oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> gene expression. by using the single sandwich system for fungal inoculation, up-regulation of oscpk <dig> gene expression occurred as early as  <dig> h post-inoculation with g. intraradices . the level of oscpk <dig> transcripts remained higher at the subsequent time points in the g. intraradices-inoculated roots compared to mock-inoculated roots. concerning oscpk <dig>  its expression was also found to be up-regulated in response to g. intraradices inoculation during the time period of 24- <dig> hours. oscpk <dig> expression returned to a level similar to that of non-inoculated roots by  <dig> h post-inoculation . finally, osccamk expression increased in g. intraradices-infected roots relative to mock-inoculated roots by 72- <dig> hours post-inoculation .

overall, gene expression studies revealed up-regulation of the rice oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> genes during the presymbiotic phase of the am symbiosis. these results were consistently observed in all three independent experiments. although the expression of the oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig> and osccamk genes was up-regulated in am-inoculated roots compared to non-inoculated roots, it is also true that the amplitude of the differential expression for these genes was not very high during the time period here analyzed. concerning osccamk for which a role during am symbiosis has been demonstrated in rice  <cit> , its variation in the expression level in response to am inoculation is also low and appears to occur at a later time point compared to the observed activation of oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> gene expression.

diffusible factors released by g. intraradices induce oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> expression in rice roots
it is generally assumed that plants perceive am fungi even before physical contact between the two symbionts, and that recognition of myc factors triggers alterations in ca2+ levels and transcriptional responses in host roots  <cit> . in this work, the double sandwich method was used to investigate whether the observed induction of oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> expression is attributable to diffusible factors released by the fungus. this system prevents contact between the two symbionts while allowing the exchange of signal molecules  <cit> . oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> expression was analyzed by rt-qpcr . when using the double sandwich system for inoculation of rice roots, oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> expression was found to be rapidly activated in response to g. intraradices inoculation . however, induction of oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> expression was not maintained with time . similar levels of transcript accumulation were observed in g. intraradices- and mock-inoculated roots at the latest time point here analyzed . from these results it can be concluded that a diffusible fungal factor elicits expression of the rice oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> genes, and that this activation is transient. most probably, contact between the two partners is needed to maintain the expression of these genes in an activated manner at the subsequent stages of the infection process. under the same experimental conditions, an activation of osccamk gene expression also occurred at  <dig> h post-inoculation although differences in osccamk gene expression between am-inoculated and mock inoculated roots were lower than those observed for the cpk genes .

oscpk <dig> expression in microdissected root cells
the laser-microdissection  technology has been successfully used for gene expression analysis in arbuscule-containing cells in different plant species such as medicago, lotus or tomato  <cit> . a variety of protocols have been developed for lmd of root tissues in order to identify the most appropriate fixation and embedding conditions that preserve cellular morphology, while still enabling extraction of high quality rna for pcr amplification. in this way, laser microdissected cells can be used for rna extraction and expression studies, thus avoiding the dilution effect of rna samples extracted from whole roots. in this work, the protocol previously developed  <cit>  for the isolation of cells from tomato roots was applied for the acquisition of rice root cells. the use of paraffin tissue preparations coupled to methacarn fixation provided rice root tissues that satisfactorily retain the cellular morphology. next, rna samples of high quality were obtained from laser microdissected root cells.

sections of the epidermis and the cortex were prepared from g. intraradices- and mock-inoculated rice roots at four days after inoculation . cells, either epidermal or cortical cells, were collected pooled and used for rna extraction. the cell type-specific pattern of expression of the oscpk <dig> gene was examined in laser microdissected cells. as it is shown in figure 2f, oscpk <dig> transcripts were exclusively detected in cortical cells of g. intraradices-inoculated rice roots. oscpk <dig> transcripts were not detectable in epidermal cells of the fungal-inoculated roots. the absence of pcr amplification products in epidermal cells of the fungal-inoculated roots was confirmed by nested pcr . transcripts for the ubiquitin <dig> gene  or the cyclophilin gene  were also detected in all the rna samples obtained from laser microdissected cells. the use of gene-specific primers that span introns excluded the possibility of genomic dna in total rna samples used for rt-pcr analyses. the absence of an amplified product in rt-negative reactions also excluded any dna contamination in rna samples obtained from laser microdissected cells . finally, oscpk <dig> transcripts were detected in rna samples obtained from the two cell types captured from fungal-inoculated and control roots, this observation further supporting the integrity of the rna samples used in this study .

when comparing the results obtained on oscpk <dig> expression in laser microdissected cells  and whole roots , an apparent contradiction is observed. thus, oscpk <dig> transcripts were not detected in isolated cells from mock-inoculated roots  whereas rt-qpcr analysis revealed oscpk <dig> expression in whole roots . this finding could be explained taking into account the plant material and experimental approach used in these studies. in this work, only two cell types of the root were harvested for lmd-related analyses . thus, the detection of oscpk <dig> expression in whole mock-inoculated roots could be due to the presence of cell types constitutively expressing oscpk <dig> that were not analyzed with lmd . additionally, transversal sections were routinely made at aprox.  <dig> cm from the root tip. thus the observed expression of the oscpk <dig> gene in regions of the rice root other than that used for laser microdissection  might well account for the observed oscpk <dig> expression in mock-inoculated whole roots. this observation also illustrates the fact that results obtained in gene expression by using entire roots might often be misinterpreted and spatial differences in gene expression might not be perceived by using whole roots. clearly, a more detailed analysis of oscpk <dig> expression during growth and development of the rice root is needed.

subcellular localization of oscpk18
onion epidermal cells are widely used as a convenient system in which to evaluate the subcellular location of gfp-tagged proteins. accordingly, the subcellular localization of oscpk <dig> was investigated in onion epidermal cells transiently expressing gene fusions to the green fluorescent protein  . confocal microscopy of transformed onion cells revealed that oscpk18-gfp localizes to the cell periphery, likely the plasma membrane . as expected, onion cells expressing the gfp gene showed fluorescence distributed throughout the cell .

onion epidermal cells are also particularly useful for analysis of plasma membrane proteins because the environmental conditions can be manipulated to cause plasmolysis and partial separation of the plasma membrane from the cell wall. the onion epidermal cells were plasmolyzed after being transformed with oscpk18-gfp. in plasmolyzed onion cells, the oscpk18-gfp displayed a pattern consistent with its location in the plasma membrane of the shrunken protoplasm . under these conditions, protoplast pull away from the cell wall, leaving large numbers of thin plasma membrane bridges, known as hechtian strands, firmly anchored to the cell wall .

analysis of the amino acid sequence of oscpk <dig> shows that the oscpk <dig> polypeptide possess a n-terminal myristoylation site at the gly residue at position  <dig>  suggestive of n-myristoylation. the need for this lipid modification to promote and stabilize membrane association of certain cpks has been experimentally demonstrated  <cit> . to address the role of the myristoylation site of oscpk <dig> in plasma membrane association, a mutation at the n-terminal myristoylation site  of the oscpk <dig> polypeptide was made. the gly <dig> was converted to ala  and fused to gfp . transient expression in epidermal onion cells showed that the gly <dig> mutation abolished the plasma membrane localization of oscpk <dig> . instead, a distribution throughout the cell was observed for the mutated version of oscpk <dig> similar to that of the gfp alone. these findings suggest that the n-terminal myristoylation site is required for subcellular localization of oscpk <dig> at the plasma membrane.

phylogenetic analysis of cpk genes
in this work, the evolutionary relationships among cpks from rice and known cpks from other plant species establishing association with am fungi was determined. for this analysis, the full-length cpk protein sequences from cereal species, namely wheat and maize, as well as cpks so far characterized in the model symbiotic species of medicago were used. as previously mentioned, the rice genome contains  <dig> cpk genes which classify into four major phylogenetic groups   <cit> . known ccamk protein sequences from rice, wheat and medicago were also considered. in this respect, the rice genome contains a single ccamk gene  <cit> . as arabidopsis is not a host for am fungi, this species was not included in the phylogenetic analysis.

phylogenetic trees of cpk and ccamk proteins were constructed based on the neighbor-joining method  or the maximum parsimony method . the aligment of the various proteins used for construction of the phylogenetic tree is presented in additional file 4). similar to what was previously reported  <cit> , the rice cpks clustered into four distinct phylogenetic groups . four distinct cpks, oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig>  cluster into an independent clade of cpks, the group iv, which appears to have diverged significantly from the other rice cpk sequences. noticeably, results here presented show that oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> are both up-regulated by the am fungus g. intraradices, these particular cpks belonging to group iv of rice cpks. as for the other members of the group iv of rice cpks, no expression could be detected in the rice roots for oscpk <dig>  whereas oscpk <dig> exhibited a low expression but no responsiveness to am inoculation.

some interesting observations came from the phylogenetic analysis of cpk and ccamk proteins. firstly, oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> appear to be closely related to the am-associated mtcdpk <dig> . secondly, group iv of rice cpks and ccamks are closely related each other. indeed, group iv of rice cpks appears to be more related to ccamks than to the other rice cpks. here, it is worthwhile to mention that the essential function of mtccamk and osccamk during the mycorrhizal symbiotic association is well documented  <cit> . finally, the oscpk <dig> is clearly related to tacpk <dig>  one of the  <dig> cpks described in wheat  <cit> .

sequence analysis of the oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> promoters
knowing that the oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> genes are transcriptionally activated in response to inoculation with the am fungus g. intraradices, it was of interest to investigate whether symbiosis-related cis-elements are present in the promoter region of these genes. the oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> promoter analysis was carried out using the place algorithm  <cit>  and extended to genes that are known to be required for both am and rhizobial root nodule symbioses, such as the mtcpk <dig> and mtccamk genes from m. truncatula and the osccamk from rice.

analysis of the  <dig> kb promoter region of the oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> genes revealed the presence of the ctctt element  which is found up to five and six times in the oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> promoter, respectively . the nodcon2gm as well as the nodcon1gm element  are characteristic motifs of promoters from genes that are regulated during root nodule and am symbiosis. these motifs are also part of the "organ-specific element"  sequence  <cit> . the mtcpk <dig>  osccamk and mtccamk promoters contain several copies of the nodcon1gm and nodcon2gm consensus sequences.

interestingly, multiple copies of the abre-related consensus motif  were present in the proximal region of the oscpk <dig> promoter . the abre-related motif is a cis-element identified in the upstream region of  <dig> ca2+-responsive up-regulated genes  <cit> . furthermore, up to three copies of the cgcg-box element  are found in the oscpk <dig> promoter, this element being involved in ca++/calmodulin-regulated gene expression  <cit>  . the oscpk <dig> promoter region contains one copy of the abre-related motif element. the gatatc  was recognized in the oscpk <dig>  mtcpk <dig> and mtccamk promoters . this element is found in the upstream region of phosphate starvation responsive genes from several plant species  <cit> .

finally, the oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> promoters harbor multiple stress-related cis-acting elements, including elements that are known to confer responsiveness to pathogen-regulated genes. some of them were represented many times in these promoters, such as the tgac-containing w box of wrky transcription factors . in line with this, we recently reported the activation of defense-and stress-related genes during colonization of rice roots by g. intraradices  <cit> . whether the expression of the oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> genes is regulated during pathogen infection in roots remains to be determined.

overall, this study revealed the presence of symbiotic-related motifs, as well as putative elements related to ca2+ regulation of gene expression, in the promoter region of the oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> genes. this observation is consistent with the observed induction for the two cpk genes in am-inoculated rice roots.

discussion
in this work, the expression of cpk genes was monitored during the early stages of the am symbiosis in rice. the oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> consistently showed up-regulation in response to am inoculation. evidence is also presented on the transcriptional activation of oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> expression by diffusible molecules produced by g. intraradices. when comparing the expression profiles of the rice cpk and ccamk genes, it appears that activation of the two cpk genes  occurs earlier than that of osccamk pointing to a role for these particular rice cpk genes at the early stages of the symbiotic process. the observation that the oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig>  osccamk, mtcpk <dig> and mtccamk genes share symbiotic-related cis-elements in their promoters is also indicative of the transcriptional regulation of these genes as part of the signaling mechanisms involved in the am symbiosis in rice. an expanded view of oscpk <dig> gene expression came from expression studies in laser microdissected cells isolated from rice roots. at  <dig> days post-inoculation with g. intraradices, oscpk <dig> was detected in cortical cells and not in epidermal cells.

clearly, the specificity of a cpk functioning in a given signaling pathway may be achieved not only by a differential pattern of expression but also by targeting of the cpk protein to a particular subcellular compartment. along with this, cpk proteins appear to be widely distributed among subcellular compartments including cytosol, peroxisome, plasma membrane, oil bodies and nucleus, as well as in association with actin filaments, mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . our results in transformed onion cells clearly demonstrated that oscpk <dig> localizes to the plasma membrane. moreover, the association of oscpk <dig> to the plasma membrane is possibly linked to n- terminal myristoylation of this protein.

knowing that cpks act as ca2+ sensors in plant signaling, and that ca2+ plays an important role in the am symbiosis, a function of oscpk <dig> as a ca2+ sensor during the am-induced host responses to am fungi can be envisaged. thus, perception of the fungal-produced symbiotic signal would activate downstream signaling events required for the establishment of the symbiotic association, including the cytoplasmic and nuclear ca2+ spiking responses  <cit> . alterations in the ca2+ level would be itself a major factor in mediating up-regulation of oscpk <dig> gene expression in the nucleus, as judged by the presence of the ca2+-responsive cis-elements in the oscpk <dig> promoter region  <cit> . in line with this, previous studies in arabidopsis revealed the presence of abre-related sequences in ca2+-responsive genes, and exclusively in up-regulated ca2+-responsive genes  <cit> . tetramers of the abre-cis element are sufficient to confer this transcriptional activation in response to ca2+ transients. the presence of multiple ca2+-responsive cis-regulatory elements in the promoter region of the oscpk <dig> gene  favors the possibility of a ca2+-mediated up-regulation of oscpk <dig> gene expression. the identity of the transcription factors that respond to rapid transient ca2+ signals and that subsequently activate gene expression through abre-related cis-elements remains to be determined.

in addition to its transcriptional activation, a direct regulation of the oscpk <dig> enzyme activity by ca2+ can be expected. thus, it is well known that the activity of cpks is regulated by the binding of calcium to its intrinsic calmodulin-like domain. at basal ca2+ concentrations, the functional autoregulatory domain acts as a pseudosubstrate that inhibits the kinase activity of cpks . in response to transient increases in the level of cellular ca2+, cpks undergo conformational changes that activate their kinase activity   <cit> . it is then reasonable to assume that the plasma membrane-localized oscpk <dig> protein sense the am-induced increase in cytoplasmic ca2+ levels and transduce this signal into phosphorylation processes. the oscpk18-mediated signaling processes might then be crucial for root colonization and accommodation of the fungal symbiont in the root cortex. the identification of downstream targets of the oscpk <dig> kinase activity requires, however, further investigation.

on the other hand, our phylogenetic analysis of cpks and ccamk of plant species that are able to establish mycorrhizal associations revealed that group iv of cpks and ccamk are closely related each other pointing to an evolutionary relationship between the two families of protein kinases. in other studies carried out in the green alga it was proposed that ccamk originated through gene duplication from cpk during green alga evolution  <cit>  altogether, these findings are in clear support a functional specialization of members of the group iv of cpks and their relatedness with ccamk functioning. adaptation steps probably occurred in different plant species that determined their functional specialization and symbiosis-specific regulation.

the current work also provides a foundation for further functional investigation of the complex cpk family in relationship to the mycorrhization ability in another cereal species, such as wheat. thus, the phylogenetic analysis of cpks revealed that oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> are closely related to the wheat tacpk <dig> protein as well as to the medicago mtcdpk <dig> protein. for mtcdpk <dig> a role during the establishment of the am symbiosis is well documented  <cit> . it is then tempting to speculate that the tacpk <dig> gene might exhibit an am-regulated expression pattern in wheat plants.

an intriguing aspect is the presence of three arabidopsis proteins in group iv of cpks  <cit> , even though arabidopsis is not a host for am fungi. to this point, it has been proposed that genes required for other aspects of plant development might have been recruited to function in symbiotic pathways. in line with this, inactivation of the mtcdpk <dig> gene is associated to a significant reduction of rhizobial and mycorrhizal symbiosis and also results in stunted roots and short root hairs in m. truncatula  <cit> . in other studies, impairment of root hair development results in defective symbiotic interactions in l. japonicus  <cit> . then, the arabidopsis cpks within group iv of cpks might play a role in normal processes during root growth and development. the finding of sym genes in species that do not associate with am fungi , also supports that specific genes functioning in normal developmental processes in roots might also regulate mycorrhizal infection. if so, this fact, would explain the observed expression of oscpk <dig> in experiments carried out on whole roots by rt-qpcr.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a new view of the molecular mechanisms involved in the am symbiosis in rice while defining an oscpk18-mediated signaling pathway functioning during this process. the rapid activation of oscpk <dig> expression in response to am inoculation, its expression being also induced by fungal-secreted signals, together with the observed plasma membrane localization of oscpk <dig>  suggest that oscpk <dig> might play a role in perception and/or recognition of the am fungus in rice. compared to legume species, less effort has been invested in the characterization of the am symbiotic interaction in this important crop species. oscpk <dig> might be considered as a marker for the presymbiotic phase of the symbiotic process that might play a preferential role in the root cortex. the identification of additional components of the am-induced signaling processes in which oscpk <dig> participates can be now approached. a major challenge for the future research is to determine whether interconnections and synergistic functions exist between cpks and sym components, this interplay determining recognition and compatibility between the two symbiotic partners.
