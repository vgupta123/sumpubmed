BACKGROUND
sugarcane  is an important economic crop not only owing to its contribution of approximately 75 % of world’s sugar production, but also because of its leading role in biofuel production. modern sugarcane cultivars are mostly interspecific hybrids derived from crosses between s. officinarum  and s. spontaneum . sugarcane cultivars are frequently aneuploid with chromosome number ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  consisting of 70–80 %  s. officinarum, 10–20 %  s. spontaneum, and 10 % recombinants between these two species  <cit> , though the classical cytogenetic studies concluded that there were no chromosomal exchanges between s. officinarum and s. spontaneum after hybridization . molecular mapping of hybrid r <dig> further confirmed that interspecific chromosome exchanges occurred between the two progenitor genomes  <cit> . gish analyses of sugarcane hybrids indicated that the proportion of complete s. spontaneum chromosomes ranged from 10 % to 23 %, and recombinant chromosomes of the two parental species varied from 5 % to 17 % in the hybrids  <cit> . typically, the f <dig> hybrids and bc <dig> progeny receive 2n gametes from female s. officinarum parent and n gametes from male s. spontaneum parent during the interspecific hybridization, a phenomenon known as female restitution   <cit> .

the genome of modern sugarcane cultivar represents one of the most complex genomes studied to date. the ploidy level and genome size can vary significantly among commercial cultivars and other related saccharum species. for example, the genome size of hybrid r <dig> was estimated at approximately  <dig> gb with a ploidy level of 12x  <cit> , while the genome size of s. officinarum ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  gb and that of s. spontaneum varied between  <dig>  to  <dig>  gb  <cit> . so far, no sugarcane reference genome has been generated yet due to the complexity of autopolyploid genomes.

sugarcane brown rust, caused by puccinia melanocephala h&p syd., has been a severe fungal disease impacting sugarcane production for many years. the genetic resistance of the brown rust was identified in sugarcane cultivar, r <dig>  which was controlled by a single dose dominant gene, bru <dig>  the resistance gene was initially mapped at a location, 10 cm away from a restricted fragment length polymorphism  probe, cdsr <dig>  <cit> . this resistance gene provides wide resistance against diverse brown rust isolates collected in both africa and america  <cit> . fine-mapping and physical mapping have been used to map this major durable resistance gene in an interval of two flanking markers, which were only  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm away from the bru <dig> gene, respectively . a physical map covering the two flanking markers was constructed through screening the bacterial artificial chromosome  clones in the existing r <dig> bac library  <cit>  and a bru1-enriched bac library  <cit> . the resulting physical map included three bac clones from the target genotype with two remaining gaps and  <dig> bac clones from homologous haplotypes. sequencing the clones in the target region revealed an inserted segment containing the target gene bru <dig> in the target haplotype contig with two gaps, and the whole segment was absent in homologous haplotype contigs  <cit> . sequencing eight bac clones, including two clones from the target haplotype and six other clones from homologous haplotypes, has revealed  <dig> annotated genes. the comparison of the eight bac clones’ gapless sequences showed an average sequence identity of  <dig>  % in the exons and  <dig>  % in introns among the haplotypes. based on the phylogenetic analysis of selected genes and sequence similarity of the seven haplotypes, four haplotypes were predicted to be derived from s. officinarum, two from s. spontaneum, and one being recombinant  <cit> .

comparative analysis between a sugarcane hybrid and its progenitor species is an effective approach to study the origin of sugarcane hybrid haplotypes, which will provide insights into chromosomal rearrangements after polyploidization and hybridization. la purple  and ses <dig>  are varieties of the progenitor saccharum species of modern sugarcane cultivars. with the available bac libraries of la purple and ap85- <dig> , we investigated the sequence divergence among sugarcane hybrid , s. officinarum  and s. spontaneum  in the bru <dig> genomic region. the objectives of this project were to: 1) clarify the origin of sugarcane hybrid haplotypes in the bru <dig> genomic region; 2) assess the evolutionary relationships of haplotypes within and between saccharum species and interspecific hybrids; 3) evaluate the extent of dna sequence divergence within major saccharum species based on sugarcane haplotype sequences; and 4) evaluate selective constraint in genomic region containing candidate bru <dig> gene. the comparative genomic study will improve our understanding of genome recombination and evolutionary relationships of saccharum hybrids and its progenitor saccharum species after hybridization.

methods
bac libraries
la purple  and ap85- <dig> derived from the anther culture of ses <dig>  <cit>  representing two major saccharum species were used for bac library construction. nuclei were isolated from the young leaf tissues of la purple and ses <dig> haploid following the method described by ming et al.  <cit> . the high molecular weight dna embedded in agarose was partially digested using hindiii. the fraction at approximately 100 kb was recovered and cloned into psmart bac vector . the bac library of la purple consists of  <dig>  clones in  <dig> 384-well plates with average insert size at 150 kb, providing  <dig> x coverage of the octoploid genome and 12x coverage of the monoploid genome. the bac library of ap85-441consists of  <dig>  clones in  <dig> 384-well plates with average insert size at 120 kb, providing  <dig> x coverage of the haploid  genome and  <dig> x coverage of the monoploid genome.

bac clone screening and sequencing
bac library screening was carried out as described by yu et al.  <cit> . for library screening, two probes about 500 bp were designed respectively based on the dna sequence of two genes identified in bru <dig> region: gene  <dig> and 11b  <cit> . among the annotated genes in the haplotypes of hybrid r <dig>  gene  <dig> is homologous to barley rust resistance protein with three missing exons. gene  <dig> and gene 11b, which surround gene  <dig>  are highly conserved among the published saccharum hybrid haplotype sequences  <cit> . two probes corresponding to gene  <dig> and 11b respectively were used to screen the bac libraries of la purple and ap85- <dig> haploid genomes .

to identify different haplotypes, the positive clones screened from the bac library were then amplified used same primers for probes preparation, cloned into the pgem®-t easy vector systems  and sequenced from both ends of the pcr product. the bac clones representing different haplotypes were selected. the insert sizes of the identified bac clones were estimated by comparing to standard size markers  using chef gel electrophoresis.

the bac dnas were isolated using phasepreptm bac dna kit  and the sequencing libraries were prepared individually with unique barcode for each clone. the sequencing libraries were then pooled and sequenced using roche  <dig> genome sequencer flx platform at keck center at uiuc. the raw reads were assembled using roche/ <dig> newbler assembler with default settings .

repeat database compiling and repeat masking
to mask the repeats from the sugarcane bac clone sequences for annotation, an in-house repeat database was compiled by assembling public available repeat databases and de novo assembling of sugarcane repetitive sequences.

to assemble the publicly available repeat databases, we downloaded tigr plant repeat database   <cit> , the mips repeat element database    <cit> , repbase   <cit>  and the p-mite database   <cit> . moreover, we also parsed  <dig> genbank sugarcane sequence accessions for features annotated as ‘mobile_element’, ‘ltr’, or ‘repeat_region’. the unique repeats were extracted from each downloaded repeat database by removing the redundant repeats that have more than 95 % sequence identity over 95 % of the sequence length to other repeats. some unique repeats were annotated in repeatmasker format  based on the repeat codes in their headers, if available, otherwise by comparing to the repbase repeats using the repeatclassifier script of the repeatmodeler package.

to de-novo identify the sugarcane repeats, available sugarcane sequences were parsed, including the sequences of the  <dig> sugarcane bac clones . the protein sequences of a. thaliana  <cit> , b. distachyon  <cit> , o. sativa  <cit> , s. italica  <cit> , z. mays  <cit> , and s. bicolor  <cit>  were downloaded from phytozome  and combined to generate an in-house plant protein database. an in-house te protein library was also compiled from te protein libraries available with maker  <cit> , gypsydb- <dig>   <cit> , transposon psi , and repeatmasker  <cit>  softwares. the de novo repeats were then predicted in the sugarcane bacs using the tedenovo pipeline consisting of repet package v <dig>   <cit>  and using repeatmodeler— <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . gene fragments in the de-novo predicted repeats were identified based on their sequence similarity to plant proteins only but not te proteins  and were then n-masked. the masked repeat sequences were split on ns and resulting sequences classified using repeatclassifier script of the repeatmodeler package based on similarity to known repeat proteins from trep and repeatmasker databases. unclassified repeats were considered as repeats if these had more than  <dig> matches to the  <dig> sugarcane bacs at e-value less than 1e- <dig> using blastn. finally, the repeat database was made non-redundant using cd-hit  <cit>  with 95 % identity and 95 % coverage threshold. the final non-redundant de-novo sugarcane repeat database contained  <dig> repeats  classified into  <dig> groups including  <dig> ltr retrotransposons,  <dig> transposons,  <dig> lines,  <dig> helitrons,  <dig> unknown,  <dig> sines,  <dig> simple repeat, and  <dig> satellite repeat. sugarcane mites were predicted using mitehunter  <cit>  with default parameters.

the final in-house repeat database was then compiled by combining the unified and annotated public repeat database and the de novo identified sugarcane repeats. the repeat content of sugarcane bac clone sequences in this study was determined by masking the bac clone sequences using repeatmasker against this compiled in-house repeat database.

identification of transposable elements  domains and estimation of te insertion times
to identify te associated domains in the bac clone sequences, rpsblast was used to search the bacs clone sequences against the conserved domain database   <cit> . overlapping te domains aligned in the same orientation on the bac clone sequences were fused as one te domain and annotated based on the best domain hit in the cdd database. the ltr retrotransposons were identified in the sugarcane bacs based on the presence of te domains. the two ends 5′ and 3′ ltrs were defined based on the sequence identity and the presence of target site duplications . the insertion time of full length ltr retrotransposons was calculated using the approach as described by san mignel et al.  <cit> . the full length ltrs were aligned by muscle  <cit>  and the number of nucleotide substitutions per site  between the 5′ and 3′ ends of ltrs was calculated using the kimura 2-parameter model implemented in mega <dig>  <cit> . the k values were converted to divergence time using the rate of  <dig> e- <dig>  <cit> .

gene annotation
the repeat-masked sequences were aligned against sugarcane expressed sequence tags  comprised of  <dig>  ests from genbank, the unigene set of our in-house sugarcane rnaseq data, and the sorghum gene models  using tblastx. the gene structures were further predicted using the online tool geneseqer , and the ambiguities were checked and manually corrected according to the alignment of the sequences to sugarcane transcripts and sorghum gene models. the annotated genes from the sequences were compared to  <dig> corresponding genes in seven haplotypes from hybrid r <dig>  and  <dig> corresponding genes from a sorghum bac   <cit> .

to estimate the expression level of annotated genes in different tissues of la purple and ap85- <dig>  we aligned rnaseq data of  <dig> million pair-end reads  <dig> million single-end reads from various tissues of la purple and ap85- <dig> respectively against the predicted cdna sequences of annotated genes using novoalign with default settings . the number of aligned reads for each target gene were counted using tablet  <cit> . the gene expression levels were calculated as fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments   <cit> .

sequence divergence analysis
protein sequences of gene pairs were aligned with clustalw  <dig>   <cit>  the alignments were converted to codon alignment with pal2nal  <cit> . the substitution rates of synonymous  and non-synonymous  were estimated based on the yn method  <cit>  using kaks_calculator  <dig>   <cit> .

ka/ks value differential significance analyses were performed using fisher exact test as implemented in kaks_calculator  <dig>   <cit> . the null hypotheses in fisher exact test is numbers of synonymous substitutions /number of synonymous sites  = number of nonsysnonymous substitutions /number of nonsysnonymous sites , also means neutral mutation. reject the null hypothesis if sd/s is significantly greater  or smaller  than nd/n, as indicated by p-value <  <dig> , and extremely significant if p-value <  <dig> . on the other hand, significance analyses for different groups of ka/ks values was performed using duncan’s test with significance level of  <dig> , which was implemented in agricolae package of r programming language  <cit> . a custom perl script was used for snp discovery based on pairwise sequence alignments .

furthermore, we applied dnasp  <dig>   <cit>  to perform sliding window analysis for nucleotide diversity, tajima’s d and fu and li’s d test with  <dig> kbp window size and 100 bp step length.

bac sequence visualization and comparison
the schematic of exons, conserved te domains and repeats in sugarcane bac sequences was generated using easyfig  <cit> . large-scale alignments between homologous bacs were performed using blastz  <cit> . the bac sequence comparison was performed using the artemis comparison tool  <cit>  and a genome alignment tool mauve with default settings   <cit> .

RESULTS
screening and sequencing s. officinarum and s. spontaneum bac clones containing bru <dig> genomic region
nine positive clones from la purple and five from ap85- <dig> were identified using two probes designed from genes  <dig> and  <dig> of the bru <dig> genomic region. among them, five from la purple and three from ap85- <dig> were confirmed by pcr. to distinguish the haplotypes and avoid sequencing the duplicated haplotypes, pcr fragments of gene  <dig> were cloned and sequenced, which confirmed four clones from la purple  and two clones from ap85- <dig> bac libraries  containing different homologous haplotypes. the insert sizes of six bac clones ranged from 80 kb to 130kb. these six clones were subjected to complete sequencing. the cleaned reads from each clone were assembled and yielded a total length of 559 kb for the six clones with average gc contents ranging from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % . the sequences of the six clones were deposited in genbank .table  <dig> summary of the sequence length, gc content, transposable element content, and gene number





fifty-two genes were annotated from the sequences of the six bac clones . the average gene density was  <dig> gene/ <dig>  kb in la purple and  <dig> gene/ <dig>  kb in ap85- <dig> homologous bac clone sequences. the total coding regions of predicted genes account for 35 % and 38 % of the sequences from la purple and ap85- <dig>  respectively.

sequence comparison between homologous haplotypes
comparative analysis was performed between the homologous bac sequences of la purple, so-57e <dig>  so-96b <dig>  so-99p <dig> and so-146h <dig>  pair-wise sequence alignments revealed insertions and deletions in all six pairs . the large indels were observed mainly in inter-genic regions between gene  <dig> and gene  <dig>  gene  <dig> and gene  <dig>  and within the genic regions of gene  <dig>  gene  <dig>  gene <dig> and gene 11a . the alignment gaps appeared in all pairs and were not equally distributed, ranging from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %  of the aligned regions. the four haplotypes shared identities of approximately  <dig>  % in average ranged from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %, and an average of  <dig>  % snps difference with a range of  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % on the gapless alignments of the corresponding regions . the average divergence among the haplotypes in s. officinarum is  <dig>  %. besides, inversions were clearly observed in alignments of all pairs excepting the so-57e04/so-96b <dig> .table  <dig> repeat content in the haplotype sequences of la purple , ap85- <dig> , and the hybrid cultivar, r570

between the homologous sequences of s. spontaneum bac clones, ss-75d <dig> and ss-23 k <dig>   <dig>  bp  from ss-75d <dig> were aligned with  <dig>  bp  from ss-23 k <dig>  showing a  <dig>  bp  expansion in ss-23 k <dig>  these two bacs shared an average sequence identity at  <dig>  % and had  <dig>  % of snps on the gapless comparison. indels were observed between these two bacs . two large transposable elements, belonging to dna/mule-mudr and ltr/copia families, were found at regions  <dig> – <dig>  and  <dig> – <dig>  in ss-23 k <dig>  respectively . in the genic regions, a  <dig>  bp insertion in intron  <dig> of gene  <dig> and a 566 bp insertion in intron  <dig> of gene  <dig> were found on the ss-23 k <dig> , presenting a  <dig>  %  expansions in genic region of the bac sequences. these results indicated that the expansion on haplotype of ss-23 k <dig> was originated from transposable element insertions in both genic and intergenic regions.fig.  <dig> comparison of the genome structures between  <dig> haplotypes  from la purple , ap85- <dig> , the hybrid cultivar r <dig>  and sorghum. genes are presented by color pentagon boxes. psudogenes are marked with star, and tes are indicated by rectangle and showed by color. genes are numbered according to additional file 2



sequence comparison between haplotypes of s. spontaneum and s. officinarum showed large indels in intergenic regions between two pairs of genes: genes  <dig> and  <dig>  genes  <dig> and  <dig>  and within the genic regions of two pairs of genes: genes  <dig> and  <dig>  genes  <dig> and 11a. in addition, large segmental insertions were observed in intergenic regions between genes  <dig> and 11b in all the haplotypes of s. officinarum, which can be used as a s. officinarum-specific marker to distinguish the origin of haplotypes in hybrids. unevenly distributed alignment gaps existed in all eight pairs of bacs ranging from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % of the aligned sequence. inversions were found in the corresponding regions between genes  <dig> and  <dig> of paired haplotypes of ss-23 k06/so-146h <dig> and ss-75d04/so-146h <dig>  further sequence analysis has shown that the inverted segment of  <dig> – <dig>  in so-146h <dig> might be originated from the duplication and inversion of the segment of  <dig> – <dig>  . based on the gapless alignments of the corresponding regions, the two haplotypes of s. spontaneum shared an average of  <dig>  %  sequence identities and showed an average of  <dig>  % snps  with the four haplotypes from s. officinarum .

identification of snps in the bru <dig> homologous haplotypes
in the bru <dig> homologous haplotypes, pairwise sequences alignments were performed for discovering snps within and among saccharum species in the gapless regions .  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> snps corresponding to  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp of aligned sequences were identified within s. officinarum, s. spontaneum and between s.officinarum and s. spontaneum, respectively. the snp densities were higher in between s. officinarum and s. spontaneum than within each of the two saccharum species.table  <dig> pairwise snps distributions in saccharum species

notes

the snps discovery was based on pairwise gapless sequence comparisons

 <dig> snps : the percentage of fragments for specific sizes  that contained no snp

sd: the standard variation of snp numbers among the specific sizes of fragments

so: s. officinarum, ss: s. spontaneum




to evaluate the distributions of snps and the possibility of distinguishing the homologous haplotypes in saccharum genomes, the snp number of the fragment with sizes of 100 bp, 250 bp, 500 bp and 1000 bp were identified in the pairwise alignment in the bru <dig> homologous haplotypes. the results revealed that  <dig>  % of 100 bp sequences pairs and  <dig>  % of snps of 250 bp sequences pairs had no snps in s. spontaneum. s. spontaneum were observed to exhibit more identical sequences between the two bru <dig> homologous haplotypes .

identification of species-specific haplotypes in r570
segmental indels between gene  <dig> and gene 11b were presented in s. officinarum la purple and absent in s. spontaneum ap85- <dig>  these indels can be used to identify the species-specific haplotypes in saccharum hybrid r <dig>  based on the large s. officinarum insertion fragment, the six haplotypes from hybrid r <dig> can be sorted into two groups, one group including bacs 142 j <dig>  135p <dig>  253g <dig> and cir9020/12e <dig> with the insertion as in s. officinarum, and the other group including bacs 15 n <dig> and 197g <dig> without the insertion as in s. spontaneum. 53a <dig> was not grouped together with the other bacs because it does not have the corresponding homolog sequence .table  <dig> the feature of syntenic genes on saccharum and sorghum bacterial artificial chromosome  clones

the sequence comparisons provided a reference for distinguishing the haplotype origin in saccharum hybrids. the four haplotypes with the large inserted fragment from r <dig> shared higher sequence similarity  with s. officinarum than that with s. spontaneum  . the sequence of bac clone 53a <dig> missing the corresponding insertion also presented higher sequence similarity  with s. officinarum than that with s. spontaneum . bacs 15 n <dig> and 197g <dig> shared  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % sequences identities with s. spontaneum haplotypes, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  % with s. officinarum haplotypes, respectively .table  <dig> the average sequence identities between the homologous haplotypes from two progenitors and saccharum hybrids r570





furthermore, to verify the prediction by garsmeur et al.  <cit> , similar analyses with phylogenetic tree and haplotype networks were used to identify the origin of the bru <dig> region in saccharum hybrids with homologous sequences from two progenitor saccharum species as references. to be comparable, a similar synthetic representation as garsmeur et al.  <cit>  for the results is presented in fig.  <dig>  the maximum divergence between two alleles within a locus ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>  myrs. sh15n <dig>  cir9020-12e <dig> and ss-23 k <dig> contain two of the most divergent gene alleles. based on the phylogenetic analysis of gene alleles, genes  <dig>   <dig>  and 11b were all grouped separately from s. spontaneum and s. officinarum haplotypes; gene  <dig> from two s. spontaneum and three out of four s.officinarum haplotypes  were grouped. therefore, the hybrid bacs 142 j <dig>  135p <dig>  253g <dig>  and 53a <dig> should be originated from s. officinarum as shown by phylogenetic groups of genes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  while, hybrid bacs 15 n <dig> and 197g <dig> should be from s. spontaneum according to phylogenetic group of genes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 11b . in addition, in haplotype cir9020-12e <dig>  genes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were grouped with the s. officinarum alleles, and gene 11a in the s. officinarum specific indel region was presented, while, 11b was grouped together with the s. spontaneum alleles. this result demonstrated that cir9020-12e <dig> was a haplotype with a recombinant region between gene 11a and 11b. our results confirmed the prediction by garsmeur et al. that of the seven haplotypes from saccharum hybrids, four were derived from s. officinarum, two from s. spontaneum and the remaining one was from recombinant.fig.  <dig> schematic representation of verifying the homologous haplotype origin in saccharum hybrid r <dig> based on homoologous gene allele sequence comparison with two progenitor saccharum species as references. notes: similar analyses as garsmeur et al.   <cit>  were performed for the schematic. each gene allele is represented by a square. for each locus, the most divergent allele is marked in black and its theoretical divergence time  is indicated in italics. all alleles that fall into groups  with all values lower than one-third of this maximum divergence time are marked by white squares. when the phylogenetic trees were not degenerate, the alleles  of the same branch  were placed in vertical dotted boxes. but for five alleles of loci  <dig>  the alleles from the same phylogenetic tree branch were placed in the transparent blue boxes due to they distribute separately in the figure. the white triangle in the black square for locus 11a indicates an insertion. the ‘x’ mark indicates absence of the gene



gene arrangements and structures in homologous haplotypes
the lack of genes  <dig> and 11a was observed in haplotypes of s. spontaneum  in comparison to haplotypes of s. officinarum  . similarly,, genes  <dig> and 11a were only found in our in-house rna-seq database of s. officinarum, but not in s. spontaneum. except these two genes, all the other genes remained the same order and orientation with conserved sizes and coding sequences in both species. pseudogenes were found in alleles of both saccharum species. in the two haplotypes from s. spontaneum , a premature stop codon caused by an insertion was found in the exon  <dig> of gene  <dig>  in s. officinarum, a premature stop codon was also observed in the exon  <dig> of gene  <dig> and exon  <dig> of gene  <dig> in the haplotype of so-96b <dig>  which resulted two pseudogenes. two large insertions, 21 kb and 17 kb, were found in the introns of genes  <dig> in haplotypes of so-57e <dig> and so-99p <dig>  respectively .  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes  in two saccharum species were identified to be pseudogenes .

comparing the genomic region in two species and hybrid r <dig>  the genes in haplotypes of 15 n <dig> and 197g <dig> from r <dig> remained the same order, orientation and missed genes  as presented in the haplotypes of s. spontaneum . the remaining five of six haplotypes from hybrid bacs showed the same order and orientation as in haplotypes of s. officinarum . all the sequence alignment and gene comparison indicated that the two haplotypes of 15 n <dig> and 197g <dig> are originated from s. spontaneum, validating prediction of garsmeur et al.  <cit> . in hybrids, except gene  <dig>  the coding regions of all the other genes could be translated into complete protein sequences  <cit> .

comparing homologous sequences between sugarcane and sorghum, gene  <dig>  gene  <dig> and gene 11a were absent in sorghum. only the first exon of gene  <dig> was retained in sorghum. large indels were found in the region between genes  <dig> and gene 11b between sugarcane and sorghum, which might indicate that the region between genes  <dig> and gene 11b was a hotspot of genome rearrangement in saccharum.

the structure of each gene was analyzed. the gene size differences were mainly caused by the variations of intron length. except for genes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the other  <dig> unique genes exhibited distinct sizes of introns among the haploytypes . furthermore, ltr insertions were found in genes  <dig>   <dig>  11a and 11b, which caused the intron size variation in these genes. however, the intron variations occurred randomly among different haplotypes. by contrast, coding regions were conserved among haplotypes. of the  <dig> unique genes, exon splitting occurred in genes  <dig> and  <dig> of haplotype shiv  and shv  from the hybrid, respectively. however, these genes preserved their coding and putative amino acid sequences among all the alleles in the two progenitor species.

selective constraints on homologous genes between the haplotypes of s. officinarum, s. spontaneum and saccharum hybrid
the ka/ks ratio of  <dig> pairs of genes was compared between the haplotypes of the two saccharum species and saccharum hybrids to estimate the selective constraints for the homologs . in comparison, no significant difference of ka/ks ratios were observed in the homologous genes among saccharum species . among the  <dig> unique genes,  <dig> gene pairs from saccharum species, saccharum hybrids and sorghum were used for ka/ks analysis. the ka/ks ratios of  <dig> gene pairs  were less than  <dig> while the ka/ks ratio of the rest  <dig> gene pairs was above  <dig>  these results suggested that the majority of homologous alleles were under purifying selection. gene pairs of 11b in s. spontaneum haplotypes were found to under stronger purifying selection than in all the gene pairs in both s. officinarum haplotypes in la purple and s. officinarum-origin haplotypes in the hybrid, which might reflect the reduced functional selective constraint in s. officinarum caused by the duplication of the gene 11a . however, the ka/ks ratios of gene 11a’s pairs were very low in s. officinarum haplotypes, indicating that the gene 11a contributes more critical function to s. officinarum than gene 11b. the gene pairs of gene  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in haplotypes of s. officinarum and s. officinarum-origin in hybrid had a ka/ks less than  <dig> , indicating strong selective constraint and their critical function for s. officinarum. .fig.  <dig> ka/ks for each gene from homolougs haplotype from s.officinarum  and s.spotaneum. pairwise comparisons with duncan’s test gave p values of *, p ≤  <dig> ; **,p ≤  <dig> ; ***, p ≤  <dig> 



neutrality test
to investigate whether the homologous haplotypes fit the neutral equilibrium model, we performed tajima’s d test for 4 s. spontaenum  haplotype sequences and 8 s. officinarum  haplotype sequences, respectively. a significant negative tajima’s d-test statistic indicates an excess of the low frequency of polymorphism, which is consistent with directional selection or population expansion  <cit> . we observed significant negative tajima’s d value  in the homologous regions from s. spontaenum, suggesting these regions were under directional selection. while, no significant negative tajima’s d value  was observed in the haplotypes from s. officinarum . in addition to tajima’s d, nucleotide diversity  was estimated using dnasp  <dig> . we observed significant nucleotide diversity between s. spontaneum and s. officinarum . more than 60 % of nucleotide diversity for bru <dig> lost in the genomic regions of s. spontaneum, whereas bru <dig> in s. officinarum kept relatively higher dna diversity. fu and li’s d test analysis showed similar results. a negative d value  was observed in s. spontaneum. meanwhile, sliding window  showed that d values of a number of windows ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> were significant in s. spontaneum . however, a positive d value  of f and li was found at bru <dig> region in s. officinarum. these results were consistent with directional selection of bru <dig> in s. spontaneum.

the sugarcane hybrid r <dig> bac sequences have approximately 10–15 % higher interspersed repeat content  than in the s. officinarum  and s. spontaneum  bac sequences , which is mainly due to higher type i transposable element content in r <dig> than that in s. officinarum and ap85- <dig> bac sequences. the ap85- <dig> bac sequences have an exceptionally low amount of gypsy type ltr retrotransposons  . the saccharum hybrid r <dig> bac sequences have higher content of gypsy type elements  than copia , unlike s. spontaneum and s. officinarum bac sequences that have higher content of copia-type elements  than gypsy  . additionally, hybrid r <dig> bac sequences have more line elements  than s. spontaneum  and s. officinarum bac sequences  .

the type ii te content in the bru <dig> genomic region of the sugarcane hybrid r <dig> is comparable to its progenitor genomes, though the content of individual families differs. for example, the hybrid r <dig> bac sequences have  <dig> – <dig>  fold lower pif-harbinger transposons and  <dig> to  <dig> fold higher cacta/cmc-enspm transposons than the sequences of two progenitors. the ap85- <dig> bac sequences have about  <dig> – <dig>  fold higher tc1-mariner transposons than in s. officinarum and hybrid r <dig> bac sequences, reflecting the differential accumulation of particular te subfamilies in s. officinarum, s. spontaneum, and the hybrid.

to study the evolution of the bru <dig> locus, the large tes in the s. officinarum and s. spontaneum bac sequences at the bru <dig> genomic region were assessed in comparison with those in the corresponding hybrid r <dig> bac sequences . four full-length ty1/copia elements,  <dig> full-length ty3/gypsy elements, one full-length mu-like element, and  <dig> partial elements  in the s. officinarum and s. spontaneum bac sequences were identified fig.  <dig> distribution of transposable elements  in the bru <dig> surrounding regions of la purple , ap85- <dig> , and the hybrid cultivar, r <dig>  notes: the te names listed in the bottom row consist of four parts separated by an underscore” –“. the first part indicates the location, e.g., 01– <dig> indicates between gene  <dig> and gene  <dig> and 05– <dig> indicates within gene  <dig>  the second part indicates full length  or partial . the third part indicates orientation . colum  <dig> contains the clone identifiers: the species name, bac name, and accession  separated by underscore and the remaining columns score the presence  or absence  of each tes listed at the bottom. a superscript “t” indicates a likely full length te that was truncated due to its presence at the end of bac and a superscript “s” indicates a solo ltr. the presence and absence of gene  <dig>  and gene 11b  is also given for reference because these two genes are present in s. officinarum bac sequences but absent in s. spontaneum bac sequences. the blank cells in white indicate no data available



the most conserved te in the bru <dig> region is a partial zn-finger domain  located approximately  <dig> nucleotides downstream of the coding region of gene  <dig> . the universal presence of this domain is not only reminiscent of the shared ancestry of this region but is also suggestive of co-option of this derived segment in gene  <dig>  this is supported by the fact that gene  <dig> mrna from sorghum  includes part of this zn-finger domain.

s. spontaneum clone ss-23 k <dig> and hybrid r <dig> clone sh197g <dig> share a retroelement  located between genes  <dig> and  <dig>  s. officinarum clone so-96b <dig> and r <dig> hybrid clone sh142j <dig> share  <dig> retroelements  located between genes  <dig> and gene  <dig>  s. officinarum clones so-57e <dig> and so-99p <dig> and the r <dig> hybrid clone sh135p <dig> share two nested tes  within the gene  <dig>  r <dig> clone from bru <dig> genomic region was classified into  <dig> haplotypes  <cit> . our results suggest that r <dig> bacs, sh142j <dig> , sh135p <dig> , sh197g <dig> clone  were evolved from s. officinarum haplotype, so-96b <dig>  s. officinarum haplotype so-57e <dig> , and s. spontaneum haplotype ss-23 k <dig>  respectively. in addition to the shared tes, we identified three full-length tes and seven partial tes in s. officinarum or s. spontaneum that were not detected or lost at the corresponding location in the hybrid r <dig> bacs.

of the nine full-length retrotransposon insertions in the bru <dig> locus, six are estimated to be inserted at approximately  <dig> mya , and two were relatively young  . surprisingly, the insertion time of ty3/gypsy element  within gene  <dig> of s. officinarum so-99p <dig> sequence is much shorter than the insertion time of a ty1/copia  nested within this one and also much lower than its counterpart  in the other s. officinarum bac, so-57e <dig> . both tes in gene  <dig> of so-99p <dig> are flanked by intact target site duplications  and have dispersed mismatches in their respective pairs of ltrs, precluding mis-assembly or localized sequencing errors. thus, either chance or other factors such as gene conversion may have played a role in the sequence preservation of ltr of this ty3/gypsy element.

discussions
modern sugarcane cultivars are developed from hybridization between s. officinarum with high sugar content and s. spontaneum with stress tolerance. limited genetic diversity of parental clones became the bottleneck for modern sugarcane breeding. identification of haplotypes of the main saccharum species and tracing their evolutionary history after hybridization will provide essential information for sugarcane improvement. the isolation and sequencing of bacs in the genomic regions of the rust resistance gene in s. officinarum and s. spotaneum offered an opportunity to study the genomic features of the progenitor species in these fast-evolving and agronomically important sequences, and to validate the prediction of haplotype origins in hybrid r <dig> 

although haplotypes were highly conserved within and between saccharum species, our study identified species-specific insertions and deletions, which likely occurred after the speciation event, and can be used to identify origins of haplotypes in modern sugarcane hybrids. interestingly, genes  <dig> and 11a were completely missing in s. spontaneum, which might attribute to the consequence of the speciation event. multiple alleles in autopolyploids reduced selective constraint for those genes with no advantage in higher dose, and some alleles could have undergone pseudogenization. in the genomic region of rust resistant genes,  <dig> out of  <dig> gene alleles became pseudogenes. out of the  <dig> paired alignments, indels broke down alignments in  <dig>  % sequences, which caused a frame shift and introduced premature stop codons in some alleles and made them pseudogenes.

comparison of haplotype sequences within species showed that s. spontaneum had larger haplotype variations than that of s. officinarum , suggesting earlier polyploidization in s. spontaneum than in s. officinarum, which could have contributed to or even caused the speciation event leading to the divergence of s. spontaneum from the rest of saccharum species. in general, the sequence divergence is the highest between s. spontaneum and s. officinarnum, medium among s. spontaneum haplotypes, and the lowest among the s. officinarnum haplotypes.

saccharum species had undergone extensive genome rearrangements following polyploidization in the bru <dig> region, which is similar to the instability of maize genome after polyploidization  <cit> . gene 11a and gene 11b are duplicated genes in s. officinarum. gene11b existed in all of the s. officinarum haplotypes but was missing in s. spontaneum and sorghum . phylogenetic analyses showed that gene 11b was closer to its homologs in sorghum and rice than the 11a observed in s.officinarum , which indicated a duplication event of gene  <dig> occurred after the speciation event separating saccharum and sorghum. due to the absence of gene 11b in s. spontaneum genome, the duplication event of gene  <dig> likely occurred after the speciation event of s. officinarum and s. spontaneum and could be lineage specific in s. officinarum.

comparing to bru <dig> region in saccharum species, no large tes were observed between the genes of the corresponding region in sorghum . the large tes between genes in adh <dig> region of saccharum hybrids were also absent in the corresponding region of sorghum genome  <cit> . a te zf-rvt in the bru <dig> regions of saccharum was speculated to derived from gene  <dig> , indicating small fragment duplication occurred before the polyploidization of saccharum and after the separation between saccharum and sorghum. moreover, tes are more abundant in s. officinarum  than in s. spontaneum  . these results suggested that genome expansion in this region of s. officinarum, compared to s. spontaneum, was caused by te accumulation.

modern sugarcane hybrids contain estimated 8– <dig> copies of homologous chromosomes, and can have up to  <dig> different alleles  <cit> . although multiple alleles are considered to be functionally redundant at the time of origin, they provide raw materials for the evolution of novelty by relaxing purifying selection on the duplicated genes . six out of  <dig> allelic genes became pseudogenes in saccharum, likely due to functional redundancy. s. spontaneum genome had undergone more dynamic genome rearrangement than s. officinarum genome. in paleopolyploids , and recent allopolyploid species, such as wheat  <cit>  and tragopogon  <cit> , eliminations and pseudogenizations of essential functional genes have been well documented.

among the  <dig> unique genes,  <dig> allele pairs from saccharum species, saccharum hybrids and sorghum were used for ka/ks analysis, excluding genes that were missing in the s. spontaneum haplotypes. the ka/ks ratio of  <dig>  % allele pairs  was less than  <dig>  suggesting that the majority of homologous alleles were under purifying selection, which is consistent with the ka/ks ratios of genes in haplotypes of hybrid r <dig>  <cit> . selection resulted in nonrandom radical amino acid substitutions for many genes  <cit> . our results verified that gene 11a was a s. officinarum specific gene and likely a recent duplication from gene 11b, resulting a lower ka/ks ratio.

gene structures are highly conserved in bru <dig> and adh <dig> regions among haplotypes within the r <dig> genome  <cit> . indels were found in introns of genes when compared to sorghum and introns exhibited more variations than exons as expected  <cit> . in our study, except for genes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the other  <dig> unique genes exhibited variable sizes of introns among the homologous alleles , which are resources for developing intron length polymorphism markers in sugarcane. variations in introns have been associated with biological function both in animal and plant  <cit> . insertions of ltrs were found in introns of genes  <dig>   <dig> a and 11b, some of which could have evolved new functions via neofunctionalization, or partition their ancestral roles via subfunctionalization. intron gain/loss events were found in hybrid r <dig>  such as gene  <dig> in shiv , gene  <dig> in shv  . intron gain/loss is not a commonly ongoing process, but rather triggered by certain dramatic evolutionary events that lead to long-term bottlenecks  <cit> . since intron gain/loss events were only observed in the hybrid genome, they might have been triggered by hybridization event.

to discriminate the origin of the genome in the hybrids, we performed three comparative analyses: sequence similarity, species-specific indels, and gene phylogenetic combined with haplotype networks. sequence comparison among the homologous haplotype could be used to identify the origin of most regions in saccharum hybrids genome, but may not be sufficient to discriminate the recombinant haplotype due to the little divergence between s. officinarum and s. spontaneum. species-specific indels could be reliable markers for identifying the origin of saccharum hybrid genome. further comparison of genome between s. officinarum and s. spontaneum may identify the indels for discriminating the recombinant genome in saccharum hybrids. gene phylogenetic and haplotype network analysis could be used for identifying recombinant genome in saccharum hybrids.

one of the major challenges for sequencing sugarcane hybrid cultivar genomes is to distinguish the fractions from s. spontaneum, s. officinarum and the recombinant genome. we performed the sequence analysis of homologous haplotypes from the progenitor species of saccharum hybrids surrounding the bru <dig> region. retrotransposon insertions and sequences variations among the homologous haplotypes sequence divergence ranged from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % with an average of  <dig>  %, comparable to the  <dig> - <dig>  % indels divergence among homologous chromosomes in hexaploid wheat, which allows sequencing and assembling the autopolyploid saccharum genomes and the auto-allopolyploid hybrid genomes using whole genome shotgun sequencing approach as demonstrated in wheat  <cit> . however, long read sequencing would be necessary for discriminate the homologous haplotypes in the progenitor species because identical fragments of short reads exist in saccharum genomes.

the genome sequence diversity in wild species s. spontaneum have been demonstrated to be greater than that of the domesticated species s. officinarum . however, the two s. spontaneum homologous sequences  shared higher similarity than the sequence similarities among the homologous haplotype sequences from s. officinarum.moreover, s. spontaneum-originated hapotypes were under directional selection with an average windowed tajima’s d value of − <dig>  , while, the s. officinarum haplotypes showed no significant negative tajima’s d value. s. spontaneum contributed stress tolerance for saccharum cultivar hybrid . these results suggested that the bru <dig> genomic region in saccharum hybrid originated from s. spontaneum and is under strong directional selection. the candidate bru <dig> gene is supposed to be under strong functional constraint and has a more substantial selection in s. spontaneum than that in s. officinarum. of  <dig> homologus genes in the bru <dig> genomic haplotype regions,  <dig>  were revealed to under strong functional constraint based on the ka/ks analysis, but none of them were found to have a higher selection in s. spontaneum than in s. officinarum. the bru <dig> gene in r <dig> was revealed to be single-dose  <cit> , it is challenge to predicted dosage of bru <dig> gene in s.spontaneum, but we can conclude that bru <dig> is not octopi-dosage as the bru <dig> in r <dig> was single-dose. therefore, the bru <dig> gene may not existed in the two haplotype sequences from s. spontaneum as only quarter of alleles were sequenced, but it could be presented in the s.spontaneum originated haplotype within r <dig> because  <dig> alleles from s.spontaneum may cover all the s. spontaneum originated alleles in the saccharum hybrid. map-based cloning is hard to refine the gene in such limited genomic region. to further identify the bru <dig> gene, gene expression experiment based on rna-seq could be used to test the expressional level of the functional constraint genes. candidate gene transformation would be necessary to final confirm the bru <dig> genes.fig.  <dig> tajima’d test for bru <dig> genomic regions from s. spontaneum  and s. officinarum . notes: homologous haplotype sequences in s. spontaneum include sh15n <dig>  sh197g <dig>  ss-75o <dig> and ss-23 k <dig>  homologous haplotype sequences in s. officinarum contain so-96b <dig>  so-146h <dig>  so-57e <dig>  so-99p <dig>  sh53a <dig>  sh135p <dig>  sh253g <dig> and sh142j21



CONCLUSIONS
the commercial sugarcane cultivars are complicated allo-autopolyploid and aneuploid, mostly derived from interspecific hybridization between s. spontaneum and s.officinarum. this study reports the first comparison among haplotypes of a modern sugarcane hybrid r <dig> and its progenitor species, and provides new insights into the genome evolution of modern sugarcane cultivars. with the homologous sequences from the two progenitor species as references, species-specific indels were identified, which were used to validate the species origins of the  <dig> haplotypes from the hybrid genome of r <dig>  our results confirmed that  <dig> haplotypes of r <dig> were originated from s. officinarum,  <dig> from s. spontaneum. shcir9020-cir12e <dig> was originated from recombination. tajima’s d analysis showed that s. spontaneum haplotypes in bru <dig> genomic region were under directional selection, contributing to brown rust resistance in saccharum hybrid. the duplication event of gene  <dig> and indels among the homologous haplotypes suggested that saccharum species had undergone genome rearrangements after speciation. gene content and gene structure were relatively well conserved among the homologous haplotypes. exon splitting occurred in haplotypes of the hybrid genome but not in its progenitor genomes, signalling genome rearrangements after hybridization. among all the homologous alleles, introns vary in size while the exons are conserved. pseudogenes  caused by indels were observed for all annotated genes except gene  <dig> in the two saccharum species.
