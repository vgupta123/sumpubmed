BACKGROUND
with hundreds of enzymes commercially available today  <cit> , restriction endonuclease treatment of insert and plasmid vector dna followed by ligation and transformation into competent e. coli strains presents the standard cloning method in molecular biology. given the advances in structural biology and the advent of synthetic biology, a strong demand exists to transfer and rearrange a large variety of dna fragments from different genetic sources in a directed manner. a diverse catalogue of plasmid vectors is at hand for propagation in pro- and eukaryotic cells, enabling heterologous protein expression in various host organisms. frequently, suitable pairs of type ii restriction enzymes with unique recognition sites in the vector and insert dna fragments can be found, especially since the latter are easily produced via pcr. in such a case, the pcr primers contain add-on tails composed of the restriction endonuclease recognition sequence and additional nucleotides which ensure efficient enzymatic processing  <cit> . especially with an increasing size of the insert, however, the chance rises that it contains a recognition site of the desired restriction enzymes. statistically, the 6 bp recognition sequence of a type ii restriction enzyme such as xbai would occur once in every  <dig> / 2 =  <dig> base pairs. the situation gets worse if one aims to insert multiple sequences in dual-expression vectors, as for instance required for co-expression studies in metabolic engineering, structural and synthetic biology  <cit> . these circumstances require purchase and storage of numerous restriction enzymes or the execution of site-directed mutagenesis   <cit>  in order to remove the unwanted recognition sites. individual buffer and temperature requirements for endonuclease stability and activity  <cit>  further limit the number of cloning options.

to eliminate the problems of conventional cloning, methods avoiding the use of type ii restriction enzymes have been developed. the gateway cloning system relies on site-specific recombination catalyzed by a proprietary bacteriophage λ protein formulation in vitro <cit> . creation of large recombinant dna molecules can be achieved by the domino method  <cit>  and dna assembler  <cit> , which are based on homologous recombination in vivo by the machinery of b. subtilis or s. cerevisiae, respectively. the endogenous recombination system of e. coli can combine insert and vector molecules upon co-transfection  <cit> , which can be facilitated by expression of a homing endonuclease and bacteriophage recombinases  <cit> . similarly, a cell lysate which contains a prophage recombination system can be used in vitro <cit> . pcr-based generation of complete recombinant plasmids, preferably via a proofreading dna polymerase, can be achieved by several strategies  <cit> . for the highly complex challenge of genome engineering, homing nucleases  <cit> , transcription activator like   <cit>  and zinc-finger nucleases  <cit>  can be used.

more similar to the conventional restriction-ligation system, compatible cohesive ends can be generated in alternative ways. combined with a subsequent ligation reaction that stabilizes the paired ends, exonuclease iii  <cit>  or t <dig> dna polymerase  <cit>  can be used for their creation. ligation-independent cloning   <cit>  employs longer overhangs resulting in sufficiently stable dna base pairing for transformation. these can be created by several means, e.g. via t <dig> dna polymerase or incomplete pcr  <cit> , hybridization of pcr products  <cit> , ribonucleotide-containing primers  <cit> , terminal transferase  <cit> , abasic sites  <cit> , chemical or enzymatic cleavage of phosphorothioated dna  <cit> , or λ exonuclease  <cit> . elegant enzyme-based in vitro systems have been developed, such as in-fusion cloning  <cit> , for which the polymerase is known but not the exact composition, as well as the combined isothermal usage of a dna polymerase, a 5′ exonuclease and dna ligase, named gibson assembly cloning  <cit> . although several of the described cloning systems with individual advantages and disadvantages are commercially available, many present costly alternatives or demand complex planning.

smith et al. reported a method to create insert fragments with 5′ recessed ends via pcr, utilizing deoxyuracil-containing primers  <cit> . treatment of the pcr products with heat or alkaline solution creates 3′ overhangs compatible with those of the vector fragment. in a similar fashion, user friendly dna cloning  <cit>  utilizes a commercially available enzyme mix. in contrast to uracil dna glycosylase  treatment, this enzyme mix removes the du residues instead of cleaving the n-glycosylic bond. compatible vectors are generated by treating the plasmid dna with a nicking and a type ii restriction endonuclease instead of pcr-based amplification. as for other methods, this strategy avoids the risk of introducing polymerase errors into the plasmid backbone. although cohesive ends can also be generated by using dna glycosylase-lyase endo viii  <cit>  or endo iv  <cit>  subsequent to udg, we sought to develop a more straightforward cloning method that requires only one enzyme, no heat- or alkaline treatment and which allows the creation of more 3′ protruding end combinations .

unlike deoxyuracil, the universal base deoxyinosine  can pair with all four canonical dna nucleobases following a duplex stability series of i:c > i:a > i:t≈i:g  <cit> . in contrast to several proofreading polymerases  <cit> , taq polymerase can incorporate ditp during primer extension and readily extends di-containing dna. these properties allow deoxyinosine usage for the creation of degenerate primers  <cit>  as well as for random  <cit>  and sequence saturation mutagenesis  <cit> .

with deoxyinosine-containing oligonucleotides and endonuclease v  readily available from commercial suppliers, a method was developed to create terminal 3′ protruding ends independent of the insert dna sequence . appropriate positioning of di in the primer sequence enables the directional insertion of dna fragments into plasmid vectors by pcr, endonuclease v treatment and ligation. in order to avoid the introduction of polymerase errors, linearized vectors are created using conventional restriction endonucleases. the applicability of the system is demonstrated by successful cloning of three different coding sequences into several plasmid vectors with efficiencies matching or exceeding those of alternative approaches.

RESULTS
non-directional ampicillin resistance cassette cloning
in order to establish the proof of concept, the oligonucleotides pucamp_f and pucamp_r  were designed for the amplification of a 1114 bp region from plasmid puc <dig>  insertion of this dna sequence into a different plasmid vector was expected to confer ampicillin resistance to transformed e. coli cells, allowing straightforward detection of recombinant clones. the target sequence includes the p <dig> promoter  <cit> , the ribosome binding site, the β-lactamase  coding region and the terminal taa stop codon. both oligonucleotides were designed to form primer-template duplexes with tm values of 56–57°c. in order to enable cloning, the 5′ primer ends comprise four additional nucleotides with a deoxyinosine residue at the third position . according to previous reports and the crystal structure of the thermotoga maritima  enzyme  <cit> , treatment of the pcr products with endonuclease v was expected to result in hydrolysis of the second phosphodiester bond 3′ to di  <cit> . removal of the weakly bound 4 bp ssdna stretch creates cohesive ends compatible with those generated by the restriction enzyme kpni. figure  <dig> illustrates a similar case of cohesive end creation, whereas the design of the forward primer results in an overhang compatible with that of a different type ii restriction enzyme . it should be noted that the base-pairing properties of di  <cit>  will generate a sequence distribution at the corresponding position on the opposing strand of the pcr-generated dsdna, which is discussed in the conclusions section.

deoxyinosine residues are shown in bold, primer add-on tails are underlined and separated from regions complementary to the target sequences by spaces.

with the two synthetic oligonucleotides, pcr was conducted using taq dna polymerase and a total of  <dig> amplification cycles. subsequent to dna purification, endonuclease v treatment and preparative agarose gel electrophoresis were performed. ligation reactions were prepared with kpni-digested and dephosphorylated pires2-egfp or psb1c <dig>  respectively. next, competent e. coli xl- <dig> blue cells were transformed. after overnight incubation at 37°c, clones were found to grow on lb agar plates supplemented with ampicillin in addition to either kanamycin or chloramphenicol, respectively. accordingly, the insert dna was successfully integrated into the vector backbone and the amplified antibiotic resistance cassette  was functional in vivo.

pcr was repeated with an annealing temperature gradient spanning tm ± 3°c. as shown in figure 3a, products of the expected size were formed in all cases with comparable quantities. other, non-specific bands were not detected. consequently, the presence of the di-containing overhang did not hinder binding of the primers to the complementary plasmid dna. this is consistent with earlier studies  <cit> . to test whether e. coli colonies can serve as a direct source for the target dna, colony pcr was performed using xl- <dig> blue cells transformed with the template plasmid. cycling and reaction conditions were kept identical except for the initial denaturation, which was extended to 3 min to facilitate cell disruption and dna release. figure 3b shows that specific pcr products undistinguishable from those created by amplification from plasmid dna were formed.

while simple co-transfection of vector and insert dna fragments, each with large homologous regions  at both ends, can create recombinant plasmids  <cit> , we found no recombinant clones when the endonuclease v treatment of the insert dna was omitted. ligation reactions performed with only insert or vector dna, respectively, also did not yield ampicillin-resistant clones.

directional cloning of a rfp reporter device
since functional selection for the insertion of the ampicillin resistance cassette into plasmid vectors  did not yield information about the background of erroneous, empty or incomplete ligation events, a screening method for positive clones was employed. the red fluorescent protein  coding device biobrick bba_j <dig> was chosen since mrfp <dig> expression by e. coli is easily detected  <cit> . primers rfp-dev_f and rfp-dev_r  were used to amplify an 830 bp region which comprises the e. coli lactose  operon promoter including cap and rna polymerase binding sites, a ribosome binding site and a coding region for mrfp <dig> followed by a double taa stop codon. the tm value of the primer-template duplexes was 53–55°c. a total of 31 cycles were used for taq polymerase-based amplification. after treatment with  <dig> u of tma endonuclease v, a ligation reaction with dephosphorylated puc <dig> digested with aatii and psti was set up using a molar insert to vector ratio of 7: <dig>  transformation of e. coli xl- <dig> blue yielded  <dig> colonies, of which  <dig> were classified as rfp-positive by manual counting . five apparently rfp-negative clones were used to inoculate 5 ml lb medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. after overnight incubation at 37°c and 200 rpm, the liquid cultures possessed no or only slightly red color, respectively. dna sequencing revealed that all clones carried an rfp coding device insert. evidently, the observed low or missing red fluorescence was caused by point mutations or single base pair deletions in the mrfp <dig> coding sequence. given the high number of pcr cycles used to produce the insert dna fragment, this outcome was not unexpected. assuming a constant amplification fidelity, the range of reported taq polymerase error rates of  <dig> × 10- <dig> -  <dig> × 10- <dig>  <cit>  corresponds to a fraction of  <dig>  - 100% pcr products with one or more base substitutions. in addition, plasmid dna from seven fluorescent clones was sequenced. one clone carried two mutations of which one was silent; another clone carried one silent mutation. five clones were free of mutations in the mrfp <dig> coding region. this corresponds to a total error rate of about  <dig> × 10- <dig>  which fits the expected range . based on the frequency of rfp-positive clones, the efficiency of rfp-device insertion into the plasmid vector was ≥  <dig> %.

directional cloning of an eukaryotic coding sequence
to further explore the capabilities and limits of the cloning method, we chose to amplify the coding region of the mus musculus microphthalmia-associated transcription factor . the oligonucleotides mitf_f and mitf_r  were designed for the amplification of a 1270 bp dna fragment. the regions complementary to the template molecule were  <dig> or 21 bp in length, respectively, and a tga stop codon was introduced via an overhang in the reverse primer. the oligonucleotide design was set up for the generation of cohesive ends corresponding to those created by the restriction enzymes saci and kpni as shown in figure  <dig>  it should be noted that with two internal saci and one internal kpni recognition sites, this dna fragment cannot be cloned accordingly into the multiple cloning site of the vector using the conventional restriction-ligation strategy. the cycle number for taq-based pcr was decreased to  <dig> in order to reduce the reaction time and the frequency of pcr errors. following treatment with  <dig> u e. coli endonuclease v, purified insert dna fragments were used in five- or 10-fold molar ratios relative to digested and dephosphorylated pbluescript ii ks. competent e. coli xl- <dig> blue and bl <dig> strains were used for transformation of the ligation reactions. the five-fold molar excess of insert dna fragments yielded  <dig> or  <dig> colonies, respectively, while the 10-fold excess yielded  <dig> or  <dig> colonies, respectively. consequently, no profound differences were observed from the two different ratios of insert to vector molecules used in the individual ligation reactions. in order to detect the fraction of clones carrying the mitf target dna fragment inserted into pbluescript ii ks in correct orientation, a colony pcr assay was performed with colonies of both strains. oligonucleotides mitf-fl_f and vr2_r  were used, with the first being complementary to the insert dna sequence and the second to the vector backbone in reverse direction relative to the expected insert orientation. all  <dig> colonies tested were positive , indicating the presence of the mitf coding sequence inside the target plasmid in correct orientation. dna sequencing of five additional randomly picked clones was performed, each using flanking forward and reverse primers. one clone showed a large plasmid backbone deletion of approximately  <dig>  kb. the remaining four clones carried correct junction sites and the expected insert. despite the relatively large amplicon size for a taq-based pcr, two clones had full-length inserts free of mutations. the cloned mitf coding sequence of the other two clones had two or four mutations, respectively.

high fidelity cloning
although robust, primer extension reactions using taq dna polymerase suffer from relatively low fidelity of the enzyme, restricting the cloning of dna fragments to a maximum length of about  <dig>  kb. as shown by eckert and kunkel, improvements in fidelity can be reached by optimization of the pcr conditions  <cit> .

cloning of even larger dna fragments demands the use of a dna polymerase with proofreading capability, thus 3′-5′ exonuclease activity. several polymerases of archeal origin were reported to be unable to amplify deaminated nucleotides efficiently  <cit> . we found the enzymes q <dig> , phusion, pfuultra ii and deep ventr failing to amplify dna fragments when di-containing oligonucleotide primers were used .

however, with pfuturbo c x hotstart, one exception was found. this pfu dna polymerase mutant was engineered to overcome uracil stalling. according to the manufacturer’s description, this enzyme possesses a fidelity equivalent to that of the wild-type protein and allows generation of pcr products exceeding a length of 6 kb  <cit> . while all other tested proofreading enzymes failed to generate pcr products suitable for endonuclease v-mediated cloning, all three types of recombinants  were successfully created by using the pfu dna polymerase mutant in place of the taq enzyme. without pcr optimization, comparable numbers of colonies were obtained using a molar vector to insert ratio of 1: <dig> . ligation reactions using kpni-linearized pires2-egfp and pcr products treated with e. coli endov yielded  <dig> ampicillin-resistant colonies. expression of mrfp <dig> was detected in  <dig> out of  <dig> clones, equivalent to a cloning efficiency of  <dig> %. an increased molar vector to insert ratio of 1: <dig> yielded  <dig> colonies, of which  <dig>  were fluorescent. significantly lower in number, the origin of the  <dig> positive clones generated using a ratio of 1: <dig> without endov treatment remains unknown. presumably, in vivo recombination events occurred.

ligation reactions were set up using plasmid vector dna linearized by restriction endonuclease treatment. column two indicates whether the pcr-generated insert was treated with endonuclease v. pbsk denotes pbluescript ii ks. fractions of positive clones were determined by red fluorescence , growth in the presence of ampicillin  or colony pcr , respectively. nd = not determined.

the mitf pcr product was successfully cloned into the multiple cloning site of plasmid vector pbluescript ii ks. transformation of ligation reactions containing only the linearized plasmid vector yielded five colonies while the addition of the endov-treated pcr products resulted in 997 cfu. with 816 cfu, increasing the molar insert to vector fragment ratio to 10: <dig> did not result in a higher number of transformants. without endov treatment, transformation of the corresponding ligation reaction resulted in only  <dig> colonies, demonstrating that deoxyinosine 3′ endonuclease activity is a strict requirement for the cloning strategy to work. further analysis of the recombinants using colony pcr indicated that from  <dig> clones,  <dig> carried the mitf coding sequence in correct orientation . this corresponds to a cloning efficiency of  <dig> %.

to our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that a pfu dna polymerase mutant can achieve exponential dna amplification in pcr using two deoxyinosine-containing oligonucleotides. gill et al. have reported that the mutant enzyme v93q can extend duplexes with modified primers, while exponential amplification fails when dgtp is replaced by ditp  <cit> . using di-containing oligonucleotides, primer extension reactions with the wild-type enzyme were reported to fail  <cit> . using pfuultra ii fusion hs, we indeed observed no exponential amplification . relative to taq dna polymerase, the mutant pfu enzyme proved more sensitive towards high annealing temperatures. the target pcr product yield was found to be optimal when the primer annealing steps were performed at tm - 3°c and decreased as soon as tanneal exceeded tm . only in one case, nonspecific by-products were observed, namely for the ampicillin resistance cassette pcr conducted with tanneal ≥ tm + 3°c.

CONCLUSIONS
the developed method allows the creation of pcr fragments carrying cohesive ends compatible to those of type ii restriction endonucleases which create 4 bp 3′ overhangs, as demonstrated herein for four different restriction enzyme recognition sites. to date,  <dig> enzymes of this type are commercially available  <cit> . the key advantage of our approach is the independence of the insert dna sequence, which can - in contrast to the conventional cloning method - internally carry the recognition sequences of the restriction enzymes used for the digestion of the target plasmid vector. consequently, only the approximate insert length  and its terminal sequences  must be known. the developed method is straightforward and requires only minimal amounts of template dna, e.g. 1 ng plasmid dna or a single e. coli colony, for insert generation. with sufficient amounts of target plasmid vector at hand, all cloning steps can be performed in a single day finished by overnight incubation of transformed e. coli cells.

in contrast to other cloning strategies   <cit> , cohesive terminal sequences are created via primer overhangs only four nucleotides in length. as a result, the pcr-primers used for insert dna generation remain short, minimizing the chance for secondary structure and primer-dimer formation as well as synthesis errors to occur. including a single deoxyinosine residue, this type of modification is cost-efficient and available from commercial suppliers. even at small synthesis scale, shipped primer amounts are good for several hundred pcrs. therefore, the method is particularly cost-effective when primers can be reused, e.g. for cloning of individual mutants in the context of libraries. by employing two different overhangs, no multiple insertions were observed and cloning was directional as anticipated. consequently, the developed method is most suitable to use when no appropriate pair of type ii restriction endonucleases for the conventional restriction-ligation strategy is at hand or available. as a result, a reduced number of such enzymes has to be maintained in the laboratory. the new strategy is also particularly suited when ligation-independent cloning  methods and techniques based on homologous recombination fail, for instance when the required homologous regions cannot be created via pcr. although in principle possible, we recommended to avoid pcr-amplification of the vector dna, as it is prone to introduce pcr errors. for the same reason, cloned insert sequences should be verified by sequencing.

assuming an equal incorporation probability for all four canonical nucleotides when the dna polymerase encounters the di residue on the template strand, one out of four created insert termini can be ligated to a cohesive vector dna end . it is thus conceivable that the ligation efficiency benefits from even higher molar insert to vector ratios. based on our experiences, however, ratios between 5: <dig> and 8: <dig> are optimal. it should be emphasized that for all plasmid clones described within this study, the created ligation sites presented an exact match to the overhang of the vector fragment. evidently, only pcr amplicons having precisely matching cohesive ends hybridize efficiently with vector molecules. consequently, inserts which contained mismatches at the position complementary to the di residue were not ligated to the linearized vector at detectable frequencies. note that ligation conditions were chosen according to the manufacturer’s recommendation for t <dig> dna ligase and cohesive ends. conditions potentially favoring the formation of wrong pairings  should be avoided. while sufficient colony numbers were obtained in all cases, it should be noted that competent cells with relatively low transformation efficiency were used intentionally.

although the terminal transferase activity of taq dna polymerase  <cit>  could potentially cause ligation problems, additional nucleotides flanking the ligation sites or mutations therein were never observed. inexpensive and robust, this enzyme is recommended for cloning of insert sequences up to 500 bp in length. compatibility with the pfuturbo cx hotstart dna polymerase relieves the limitations generated by the relatively low fidelity of the taq enzyme and greatly expands the application range of the cloning method. it is further possible that the absence of terminal transferase activity leads to higher cloning efficiencies compared to taq polymerase.

with its broad buffer compatibility, e. coli endonuclease v allows its combined use with more than  <dig> commercially available restriction enzymes  <cit> . this could further expand the range of cloning options by generating one cohesive end via endov and one via a type ii restriction endonuclease. in addition, this enzyme can be heat-inactivated and requires an incubation temperature of 37°c in contrast to the highly stable thermotoga maritima enzyme. since a fill-in reaction by the dna polymerase cannot take place, a direct addition of endonuclease v to the pcr mixture after thermocycling is also conceivable.
