BACKGROUND
in recent years, sequencing genomes has been accelerated manyfold  <cit> . with a wide availability of reliable genomic information, understanding of complex biological systems is now limited by the ability to develop new and measure subtle changes in phenotypes in an equally rapid rate  <cit> . in some areas, phenotyping has kept pace through advances in techniques like high-throughput fluorescent  <cit>  and optical computed tomography screening  <cit> . both of which allow for hundreds of individuals and phenotypes to be screened in rapid succession and/or in parallel. particularly in the field of plant genetics, automation in phenotyping has greatly increased the throughput and reliability of genetic studies  <cit> . however, for high-resolution analyses such as sem, confocal microscopy, and synchrotron-based x-ray tomographic microscopy , dealing with large numbers of samples  is difficult to impossible for a number of reasons. the first factor is preparation time, since many of these techniques require careful, individual, often human-intensive sample preparation which takes time and scales linearly with the sample count. the second factor is the acquisition time, which on many systems extends above several hours. consequently entire studies require thousands of hours of pure acquisition, which is tedious and often long enough that imaging characteristics of the involved components can change significantly. finally once all of the data are collected, the task of extracting meaningful metrics from the images can be even more difficult and time consuming than the initial two tasks. in particular for hierarchical systems with thousands of substructures few standards exist for meaningfully characterizing either the ensemble behavior or the complex relationships between levels in the hierarchy.

complicating the huge time requirements are the importance of reproducibility, which is impossible when too many human elements are involved. finally management of all the samples, data, and results, which easily exceed the capacities of analysis tools like excel , r  <cit> , and matlab , make data analysis difficult and time consuming and make data exploration all but impossible.

even more scalable tools like sqlite are unable to deliver results quickly. thus, up until now, most large-scale analysis of phenotype on micro- and nanoscale systems has been a gigantic undertaking . while much of the work done has provided fascinating insights into the genetic regulation of specific phenotypes, it has lacked a consistent high-throughput reproducible framework that would enable future studies to be easily conducted with minimal time investment.

we have developed an optimized, reproducible, automated pathway from sample to final results . we combine hardware automation involving a robot sample exchange system  and software automation for aligning, reconstructing, and analyzing to radically reduce the time investment for performing such a study  <cit> . once the images are collected, the analysis is done using an in house post-processing pipeline  to segment, label, and quantitatively characterize the structures. with new detector technology already enabling scan times below a second and continual improvements in the efficiency and performance of the entire pipeline, the measurements done  <dig> years ago for this study which took  <dig> minutes could soon be done in seconds. in light of this streamlining, we propose a new approach to measuring phenotypes and genetic linkage studies which brings the time-scale of these experiments from many years to weeks. we also show how this approach is compatible with many of the new initiatives of open and reproducible science. using these methods, we identify loci responsible for regulation of cellular-level structure and organization.fig.  <dig> the diagram shows the flow of samples and information from the measurement to the statistical analysis. the automatic exchange system is shown as . the reconstruction of the x-ray absorption values are shown as . the segmentation into the different phases is shown as . several of the final phenotypes extracted are shown for the cortical bone, canals, and osteocytes in 



we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by addressing one of the major challenges of bone biology, understanding bone quality at a cellular scale. fractures in the femur neck are one of the most debilitating and when surgically treated in the elderly have a mortality rate of  <dig> in  <dig> within a year, and require for nearly  <dig> in  <dig> cases, additional surgery within  <dig> years  <cit> . this bone-strength is multi-factorial, and while bone loss must play an important role, the standard clinical measure of bone mineral density  only correlates weakly to mechanical properties. bone quality as defined through structure and organization of bone properties plays a more important role for these cases  <cit> . existing studies have examined inheritance in bone microstructure , but do not use sufficient resolution to characterize the cellular structures inside cortical bone nor manage to disentangle growth hormone during the mapping of specific regions of the genome. to link the microstructure phenotypes to specific gene loci, we performed a large scale study of morphology and cortical micro-structure on a population of mice raised in a controlled environment with known genetic lineage, an intercross-experiment. the mice were 2nd generation offspring from two different commonly used strains of mice with high  and low  bone mass with both strains homozygous for a mutation in the growth hormone releasing hormone receptor. we then measured and statistically analyzed these results with the tools of quantitative trait localization to establish explanatory models for phenotype variation and produce a map enabling the targeted search for specific genes involved in bone quality. this will lead to the elucidation of potential mechanisms of regulation and maintenance of bone strength. since the homology between murine and human genomes is over  <dig> %  <cit> , we hope to make inroads towards the targeted identification of high-risk patients based on genetic screening, and a personal medicine-based approach to treatment.

RESULTS
we found that the heritability criteria  were met for the following metrics: cortical thickness variation , canal density , lacuna density , mean lacuna volume, lacuna stretch , and lacuna distribution oblateness  described in  <cit>  . the distribution of additional phenotypes in the f <dig> group is shown in the additional file  <dig>  we then determined the threshold or penalty criteria  for significance and interaction for each of the phenotypes through the permutation approach discussed in the methods. these values were used to fit qtl models for the selected phenotypes plus bone mineral density and cortical thickness for comparison. the qtl models were found for every phenotype except for distribution oblateness. the models that were found were able to explain 8â€“ <dig> % of the f <dig> population variance using between  <dig> and  <dig> loci. the models and lod curves for several particularly loci-rich chromosomes are shown in fig.  <dig>  from these models, we found the markers within the  <dig> % confidence interval as calculated using the lod curves, which had previously been linked to other phenotypes. we then selected several metrics potentially specific for the microstructural parameters we investigated . the loci and respective markers are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> the distribution and heritability for the selected microstructural metrics for qtl analysis: cortical thickness variation, canal density, lacuna density, lacuna volume, lacuna stretch, lacuna distribution oblateness. the values are shown as histograms  with female colored in pink and male colored in blue. the distributions for the respective parental strains are shown as the black curves with different line styles indicating the parental strain

overlapping markers the table and graphs shown in table  <dig> and figs.  <dig> and  <dig> demonstrate the overlap between the results of this study and a wide variety of published loci. since our initial intent was to better understand bone quality in the context of mechanical properties, we will focus most intently on the overlap with mechanically-relevant markers, which are shown in table  <dig>  the most interesting results are the loci on chromosome  <dig> and chr <dig> since they are independent of bmd . the corresponding phenotypes from this study are lacuna number density  and lacuna stretch . the other relevant traits at these loci are different from ours, and the first is related to femoral bone, while the second to vertebral bone and body growth.table  <dig> qtl models . the table shows the positions for the identified loci  for each phenotype . for each loci the additive component is shown as being either c3h >b <dig> or c3h <b <dig> indicating in which genotype the phenotype value is higher. dominance, if present, is shown by a  next to the appropriate parental strain. finally the variance explained and lod score  are shown as determined by removing that term from the analysis. although several of the models involved interactions they are not indicated in this table

the second focus was to understand properties which are independent of bmd, since bmd has been so well characterized in mice and human populations and is easily measurable. these results are summarized in table  <dig>  curiously one of the bmd loci we found has not previously been identified and thus might be of interest for further investigation to determine the validity of this qtl.table  <dig> a list of qtl from this study which have no overlap with previously determined bmd qtl. the first five columns show the chromsome, peak position, and starting and ending positions of the  <dig> % confidence interval for each qtl as determined in this study. the fifth column shows the overlapping qtl from the qtlarchive. the shaded rows indicate qtl which are also mechanically relevant

comparison with previous work the two qtl of highest interest, as mentioned in previous section, are the loci on chr <dig> at 10cm and chr <dig> at 6cm. the mechanically relevant genes were in both cases from the same work done by volkmann et al.  <cit> . in their work, the mice were not the same as in our study and were instead a cross between c3h/hej and dba/2j, with no known mutation in ghrhr. the tag located closest to the volkmann qtl, d10mit <dig> , was located on chr <dig> at position 29cm. it was associated with both ultimate and post yield displacement of the femur independent of femur geometry and body weight. the second qtl reported by volkmann overlapped with the tags d11mit <dig> and d11mit <dig> located on chr <dig> at position  <dig>  and  <dig> cm respectively.

these tags, while not independent of femur geometry, were associated with predicted modulus, yield load, and stiffness. the qtl located in this study on chr <dig> are also of significant interest because they have high lod scores and do not overlap with previously identified phenotypes possibly indicating a new gene involved only in the microstructure of bone. it is important to reiterate that these qtl are the ones, which have been published in the qtl archive run by the churchill group at the jackson laboratory  and are thus not inherently exhaustive.

discussion
the experiments and analysis we have done show the utilityand wide-spread potential of automated synchrotron-based tomographic microscopy and the associated post-processing pipeline for phenotyping large, complicated morphological phenotypes. in bone particularly, the microstructure can be well resolved and quantitatively characterized in cell shape, distribution, and alignment over millions of structures. the ability to link these phenotypes with genetic background and consequently other macroscopic, mechanical, and endocrine phenotypes provides a more complete picture of how the microstructure is correlated to existing, well-understood characteristics.

the genetic linkage results confirm loci found by earlier experiments. the mechanically relevant loci found provide the first hints at what microstructural properties might explain the variations in deformation under mechanical load. the results also shed light on several new loci, which might regulate bone structure using previously unidentified mechanisms. since much is still not known about the modeling and remodeling of bone at the cellular level, these genes might make some of these easier to understand. if we assume the approximate density of genes in the mouse genome is  <dig> per cm  <cit> , an interval of  <dig>  should be used in order to obtain single gene resolution. due to the sparsity of the identified markers no significant improvement was seen when intervals of less than  <dig> cm were used for scanning the genome. thus the current dataset is not sufficient for identifying single genes and future studies will need to be done before specific genes can be analyzed. while it is too early to identify specific genetic homologues, a comparison of the identified qtl and human-mouse homologous genes shows many matches and trends where large portions of the mouse genome are consistently mapped to the same chromosome of the human genome indicating a high degree of conservation between the two strains. this conservation indicates great promise for finding relevant human genes in future studies. the work done in the study lays groundwork for both deeper investigation of murine biomechanics and future possibilities in high-throughput genome-scale imaging. both of these tasks require fast, predictable, quantitative tools to investigate structure and function. the results primarily serve as the first map of the microstructural genome space in mice without gh. while the resolution we obtained is far from the single gene level, it allows past and future studies to compare the results with these quantities, which are traditionally difficult to measure. additionally our results provide support to conduct further congenic and eventually knock-out studies to investigate and better localize the genes involved in these metrics. in particular the d10mit <dig>  d11mit <dig>  d11mit <dig> markers should be carefully examined. in combination with mechanical testing congenic strains of these mice could reveal the connection between osteocyte lacunar density and shape and the mechanical properties of bone. further investigations could also provide insight into how morphometric metrics can be interpreted in standard samples. the lack of gh in these mice removes a significant confounding factor when identifying the unique qtl for specific phenotypes. however, for applicability in further studies, the effect of gh must be included. in mader et al.  <cit>  a comparison was made between two strains from the same parental lines as those in this study, particularly looking at mice with and without ghrhr. the results showed many differences between mice with and without gh. particularly with metrics like mean lacuna volume  and spatial distribution, gh plays a significant role and makes inferring the specific differences caused by non-growth-hormone genetic background difficult. this study serves as a proof of concept for the capabilities of high-throughput tomographic x-ray microscopy in combination with a streamlined post-processing and analysis pipeline. while this study only investigated morphological and structural phenotypes of bones, given the high sensitivity of phase contrast to biological materials and the availability of contrast agents, studies investigating more complicated biologically relevant phenotypes are conceivable in the immediate future. in particular studying the interactions between environmental stimulus and different genetic backgrounds could be of high interest and such studies necessitate very large sample sizes.

CONCLUSIONS
beyond biological applications, the framework is applicable to a wide range of high-throughput applications where large sample counts are required to achieve statistical significance. in material science, large numbers of samples measured consistently with detailed quantitative information are required to establish a link between process, structure, and mechanical behavior. based on our experience with the hundreds of imaging users at the swiss light source, we have noticed a trend in the distribution of time spent preparing experiments and analyzing the results. much as the genetics community has experienced several years ago, computed tomography measurements and experiments have become manyfold faster and easier. this has shifted much more of the burden on the analysis, with the distribution of work, in many cases being thousands of times longer for the analysis than the experiments themselves.

the developments we have made can drastically rebalance the time distribution of scientists examining the structures of complex materials, away from monotonous, repetitive, operator-biased modalities of image processing towards interpretation of vast, rich quantitative results. we think the quality and agility of research can be drastically improved. a faster post-processing pipeline means that study groups and targets can be screened much more easily and a feedback loop can be established so that studies can be tuned in nearly real-time for promising and poor results.
