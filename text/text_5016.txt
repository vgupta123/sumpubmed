BACKGROUND
coccidioidomycosis is one of the endemic mycoses in the new world caused by one of two closely related dimorphic fungi, coccidioides immitis and c. posadasii <cit> . these fungi grow in the arid alkaline soil of the lower sonoran life zone and infectious arthroconidia are aerosolized by wind and inhaled. once inside the lung the fungus converts into the pathognomonic spherule under the influence of increased temperature and pco <dig>  it is estimated that  <dig>  people are infected each year of which approximately 60% resolve on their own and do not require medical intervention  <cit> . the others have either symptomatic pneumonias or they develop disseminated disease  <cit> . the risk factors for dissemination are t cell deficiencies such as aids, organ transplantation, and pregnancy, as well as treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha  inhibitors  <cit> . furthermore, the risk of disseminated coccidioidomycosis is 5– <dig> times higher for previously healthy african-americans and filipinos than for caucasians  <cit> . this strongly suggests that there is a genetic basis for susceptibility to disseminated coccidioidomycosis. the immune response of patients who develop disseminated coccidioidomycosis is different from those with self-limited infections. the former make high titers of antibody against fungal antigens and do not have positive skin tests , and conversely, the latter respond to infection with low titers of antibody and skin test reactivity  <cit> . the genetic basis for the aberrant immune response in susceptible individuals is not clearly defined.

several years ago we discovered that inbred strains of mice vary over  <dig> logs in their susceptibility to infection with c. immitis and that resistance is the dominant phenotype  <cit> . this proved to be a polygenic trait, and a resistance locus was identified on chromosome  <dig> using recombinant inbred bxd lines  <cit> . c57bl/ <dig> mice are more sensitive to infection with c. immitis than dba/ <dig> mice such that nearly all c57bl/ <dig> mice die between day  <dig> and  <dig> post-infection  <cit> . we have shown that infected c57bl/ <dig> mice make more il- <dig> and il- <dig> and less interferon gamma  in their lungs compared to dba/ <dig> mice  <cit> . il- <dig> has pleiotropic effects on different cell types that affect the acquired immune response resulting in inhibition of the development of th <dig> immune responses  <cit> .

in the current work, microarray analysis was used to identify genes differentially expressed between lung tissue samples from resistant dba/ <dig> and sensitive c57bl/ <dig> mice following infection with c. immitis. differentially expressed genes were mapped onto biological pathways, gene ontologies and protein networks in order to fully characterize the biological processes that contribute to a protective response against c. immitis infection.

RESULTS
c. immitis infection in dba/ <dig> resistant versus sensitive c57bl/ <dig> mice
the colony forming units  in the right  lung and spleen of dba/ <dig> and c57bl/ <dig> mice were determined after intra-nasal  infection with c. immitis arthroconidia. we chose three time points after infection for analysis . since mice were only infected with  <dig> cfu and not all of them were inhaled, day  <dig> is the earliest day when there are enough organisms in the lungs to reliably quantitate pulmonary infection in all mice. c57bl/ <dig> mice began to die on day  <dig> so this was selected as the last time point, and day  <dig> was chosen as an intermediate time point. on day  <dig> after infection there were equal numbers of cfu in the lungs of both strains of mice and we could not detect dissemination by culturing their spleens . on day  <dig> and  <dig> post-infection dba/ <dig> mice had  <dig> to  <dig> fold fewer cfu/lung, and in this experiment no dba/ <dig> mice had detectable dissemination to the spleen, whereas all the c57bl/ <dig> mice had positive spleen cultures.
t-test using graphpad prism . there was no significant difference between cfu in the lungs of the two strains on day  <dig> after infection.

microarray analysis of mouse strains with differential resistance to infection with c. immitis
genes that were differentially expressed between mouse strains  before  and after  infection with c. immitis were identified by microarray analysis in an unbiased manner, in order to determine the basis for resistance. a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed between mice strains with a fold change ≥  <dig> or ≤ - <dig>  for at least one time point. the top  <dig> of these differentially expressed genes indicated a wide range of different expression profiles over the time course . we focused on those genes that showed no differential gene expression prior to infection  but were then expressed to different degrees in dba/ <dig> and c57bl/ <dig> mice after infection. several genes fitting this profile were related to the innate/acquired immune responses as mediated by ifn  <cit> , and the following ifn-stimulated genes  were selected for real-time quantitative pcr  analysis: chemokine c-x-c motif ligand  <dig> , immunity-related gtpase family m member  <dig> , interferon stimulated exonuclease gene  <dig> kda , proteosome subunit beta type  <dig> , signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  and ubiquitin d . however, the direct interpretation of red for upregulation and blue for downregulation in figure  <dig> may be misleading as the color scale reflects the ratio of gene expression in dba/ <dig> over c57bl/ <dig> mice. thus a red box in figure  <dig> could result either from a gene that was upregulated to a greater extent in dba/ <dig> than in c57bl/ <dig> mice, or from a gene that was downregulated to a lesser extent  in dba/ <dig> compared to c57bl/ <dig> mice . therefore, fold changes were also calculated by comparing expression levels post-infection  to pre-infection levels  in order to identify the direction of the change in gene expression . this revealed that cxcl <dig>  irgm <dig>  isg <dig>  psmb <dig>  stat <dig> and ubd at days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were upregulated genes in dba/ <dig> mice. post- versus pre-infection fold changes for every gene shown in figure  <dig>  and not just those selected for rt-qpcr validation , are available in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

genes expressed to a lesser extent in dba/ <dig> versus c57bl/ <dig> mice following c. immitis infection are also interesting and these too were validated by rt-qpcr . thrombospondin  <dig>  and the lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor  <dig>  fit this profile  and were selected for rt-qpcr analysis. again, comparison of gene expression between pre- and post-infection time points confirmed these genes were actually more downregulated in dba/ <dig> mice .

pathway and gene ontology analysis
we used the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery [david  <cit>  to identify pathways that were significantly over-represented in the set of  <dig> differentially expressed genes. four pathways were enriched for differentially expressed genes with a false discovery rate  corrected p-value < <dig> , and the majority of these pathways were associated with immune responses . in agreement with the large number of isgs identified in the top  <dig> modulated genes , the two pathways containing the greatest enrichment for differentially expressed genes were the chemokine signaling and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways. the fold changes associated with the differentially expressed genes at day  <dig> post-infection were superimposed on the chemokine signaling pathway and visualized using cytoscape . chemokine signaling clearly contributes to the upregulation of isgs since the following signaling cascade is upregulated at the transcriptional level: chemokine → chemokine receptor  → jak2/ <dig> → stat → isg expression .
depicted in white.

the identification of gene ontology  terms significantly over-represented in the set of  <dig> differentially expressed genes was performed using the biological networks gene ontology  tool  <cit> , which preserves the hierarchical relationship among ontology terms . using an fdr corrected p-value cut-off < <dig>  the three most significant go terms were: immune system process, immune response, and defense response. therefore, the immune related terms revealed by go analysis agree with the results obtained from pathway analysis. the entire list of go terms that were significantly enriched for differentially expressed genes at an fdr corrected p-value < <dig>  are available in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

protein network analysis
protein-protein and protein-dna interactions between  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed between mice strains at day  <dig> were identified using metacore . the resulting protein interaction network depicted in figure  <dig> consists of four major hubs: hypoxia inducible factor 1a , interferon regulatory factor  <dig> , stat <dig>  and yin yang  <dig> . these hubs represent transcription factors, which themselves, as well as their targets, were differentially expressed between mouse strains. hif1a, irf <dig>  and stat <dig>  were expressed to a greater extent in dba/ <dig> compared to c57bl/ <dig> mice, and yy <dig> to a lesser extent. stat <dig> is the largest hub representing the transcription factor regulating the most differentially expressed genes and it was previously selected as a target for rt-qpcr confirmation from the top  <dig> modulated genes . yy <dig> is a transcription factor whose “yin-yang” designation reflects its ability to both activate and repress transcription through interactions with histone acetylases and deacetylases, respectively  <cit> . a novel finding from the protein network analysis was the hub hif-1α, which is a transcription factor that plays a central role in the cellular and systemic responses to hypoxia. hif-1α is regulated at the post-translational level, which results in increases in protein half-life, and also at the transcriptional level by nf-κb  <cit> . hif1a was selected for gene expression confirmation by rt-qpcr, as was interleukin  <dig> , since it is a transcriptional target of both hif-1α and stat <dig>  <cit> .

stat <dig> and irf <dig> are both transcription factors that upregulate the expression of isgs and thus corroborate the presence of isgs in the top  <dig> modulated genes , as well as the identification of chemokine related pathways . the well-characterized isgs selected for rt-qpcr analysis, irgm <dig>  isg <dig> and psmb <dig> <cit> , were targets of stat <dig> regulation in protein network analysis . in contrast, ubd  and cxcl <dig>  were not identified as regulatory targets of stat <dig> in protein network analysis. however, they were both retained for rt-qpcr analysis since these genes are clearly regulated by ifn-γ as previously demonstrated using promoter/reporter gene constructs in the case of ubd <cit>  and gene expression studies in the case of cxcl <dig> <cit> .

targeted cytokine array analysis
microarray gene expression , pathway , and protein network  analysis, clearly indicated that interferon-mediated innate immune responses are upregulated in dba/ <dig> mice and thus are associated with resistance to c. immitis infection. the upregulation of the isgs cxcl <dig> and ubd in dba/ <dig> mice, which are predominantly modulated by type ii ifn  <cit> , suggested that the interferon gamma  gene should also be upregulated in this mouse strain. however, ifng was not a top  <dig> modulated gene  and upon closer examination of the microarray data was found to be expressed below background levels . since our initial time course may have missed the peak of induction of ifng, a targeted analysis of cytokine expression was performed at an additional time point  using a complementary technology, namely the mouse common cytokines gene array from sabiosciences . this cytokine array confirmed that ifng was expressed to a greater extent in dba/ <dig> compared to c57bl/ <dig> mice with a log <dig> fold change of  <dig>  . the cytokine with the greatest differentially expression between mice strains at day  <dig> detected by the mouse common cytokines gene array was interleukin 17a , which had a log <dig> fold change of  <dig>  . therefore, ifng and il17a were also selected as targets for rt-qpcr analysis at days  <dig> and  <dig> in order to determine if this more sensitive technique could confirm expression of these cytokines at these time points.

real-time quantitative pcr analysis of interferon and hypoxia associated genes
to validate microarray gene expression results and further confirm the role of responses to ifn-γ and hif-1α in the resistance of dba/ <dig> mice to c. immitis infection, rt-qpcr analysis was performed at days  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  post-infection for the following thirteen targets: cxcl <dig>  hif1a, ifng, il <dig>  il17a, irgm <dig>  isg <dig>  lyve <dig>  psmb <dig>  stat <dig>  thbs <dig>  tnfa and ubd. the differential gene expression between mice strains detected by microarray was confirmed at day  <dig> by rt-qpcr for all targets at the 2-fold level  except for isg <dig>  in addition, although microarray analysis did not indicate that ifng and il17a were differentially expressed between mice strains, rt-qpcr analysis confirmed that both were expressed to a greater extent in dba/ <dig> compared to c57bl/ <dig> mice at day  <dig> post-infection with c. immitis. even with a limited number of biological replicates at day  <dig>  the majority of targets  were significantly differentially expressed  between mouse strains .

discussion
analysis of the gene expression differences between mice strains resistant  and sensitive  to infection with c. immitis identified a large number of isgs associated with putative control of this fungal pathogen. innate/adaptive immune responses as mediated by type ii interferon  have previously been associated with resistance to infection with c. immitis <cit> . for example, magee and cox  <cit>  found that ifn-γ protein levels as measured by elisa were significantly elevated in dba/ <dig> mice compared to another susceptible strain  following infection with c. immitis. furthermore, treatment of dba/ <dig> mice with an anti-ifn-γ monoclonal antibody resulted in a significant decrease in their ability to control this fungal pathogen after pulmonary challenge. this current study expands on their work by clearly demonstrating that downstream isgs are expressed to a greater extent in resistant dba/ <dig> compared to sensitive c57bl/ <dig> mice  and that these genes are modulated by the jak/stat pathway , most likely activated by ifn-γ . these findings are highly relevant to human infection since patients with congenital deficiencies of ifn-γ and the interleukin  <dig> receptor beta  <dig>  are susceptible to disseminated coccidioidomycosis  <cit> .

the upregulation of isgs  in dba/ <dig> compared to c57bl/ <dig> mice was confirmed by rt-qpcr at all days post-infection . stat <dig> is integral to jak/stat signaling triggered by type i and ii ifn and upregulates a number of isgs that are involved with the host defense against pathogen infection  <cit> . ubd was the isg that exhibited the greatest upregulation in dba/ <dig> mice , and is induced to a greater extent by ifn-γ than ifn-α in human immune and non-immune cells  <cit> . several roles have been ascribed to ubd including targeting proteins for proteosomal degradation  <cit> , activation of the nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in b-cells  <dig>   <cit> , which is a central mediator of innate immunity, as well as a functional involvement in the programmed cell death mediated by tnf-α in the murine b <dig> fibroblast cell line  <cit> . cxcl <dig>  is predominantly upregulated by ifn-γ but may also be activated by type i ifns  <cit>  and binds the cxcr <dig> receptor, which is expressed on t cells in order to promote th <dig> responses  <cit> . psmb <dig>  encoded in the major histocompatibility complex class ii region, is another gene inducible by both type i and ii ifns and is a constituent of the immunoproteosome  <cit> . this gene facilitates a link between the innate and adaptive immune response since site directed mutagenesis studies have revealed a role for psmb <dig> in antigen processing and presentation  <cit> . psmb <dig> was the only isg that was expressed at significantly higher levels in dba/ <dig> mice at both day  <dig>  and  <dig> , which suggests that the protein product of this gene may play a key role in resistance to c. immitis infection.

irgm <dig> is particularly noteworthy since it belongs to a family of immunity-related gtpases whose other members, irgm <dig> and irgm <dig> , were also expressed to a greater extent in resistant dba/ <dig> compared to susceptible c57bl/ <dig> mice . irgm1-deficient mice are more susceptible to infection with mycobacterium tuberculosis, m. avium, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, as assessed by both mouse survival and bacterial loads in tissues, whereas irgm3-deficient mice exhibit normal resistance  <cit> . in contrast, both irgm <dig> and  <dig> are required for ifn-γ modulated control of toxoplasma gondii in murine macrophages  <cit> . it appears that irgm <dig> is critical for normal motility of activated macrophages in mouse models suggesting a pivotal role for this protein in the innate response to infection in vivo <cit> . the relevance of the irgm family to human coccidioidomycosis is unclear because the single gene in this family in humans, irgm, is considerably truncated and is not regulated by ifn-γ  <cit> . however, irgm does play a role in human innate immunity since it is necessary for the execution of the autophagic pathway in macrophages and the control of intracellular mycobacteria <cit> .

greater expression of ifng and il17a were detected in dba/ <dig> mice at day  <dig> post-infection using the mouse common cytokines gene array . it was therefore surprising that microarray analysis did not detect differential expression of these cytokines between mice strains at days  <dig> and  <dig> , but rt-qpcr analysis was able to do so . it is unclear why microarray analysis was unable to detect the expression of these cytokines especially since ifng expression had been detected using the same array platform  in lung tissue from c57bl/ <dig> mice exposed to lipopolysaccharide   <cit> . this array platform was designed using the c57bl/ <dig> genome and thus it is possible that these cytokines were not detected because they were not expressed to high levels in c57bl/ <dig> by c. immitis infection and contained too many polymorphisms in the dba/ <dig> homologues for efficient hybridization. what is clear from the rt-qpcr result is that ifng and il17a are expressed to a greater extent in dba/ <dig> compared to c57bl/ <dig> mice. the upregulation of isg <dig> in dba/ <dig> mice originally identified by microarray analysis was also not confirmed by rt-qpcr analysis . the probe set on the microarray  and the taqman assay  for isg <dig>  target different regions of this transcript  so alternative splicing could account for the discrepancy  <cit> .

c. immitis infection also resulted in the downregulation of genes in dba/ <dig> versus c57bl/ <dig> mice , which was confirmed by rt-qpcr . thbs <dig> encodes thrombospondin, an extracellular protein that binds a large number of substrates  to modulate cellular attachment, migration, differentiation, and proliferation  <cit> . ifn-γ appears to regulate thbs <dig> at the post-transcriptional level in keratinocytes and downregulates thbs <dig> mrna in conjunction with tnf-α  <cit> . thbs1-deficient mice have spontaneous pneumonia that leads to pulmonary hemorrhage, macrophage infiltrations and permanent damage to the lungs, which suggests that this protein is important for maintaining normal pulmonary homeostasis by limiting the extent and/or duration of inflammation  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the downregulation of thbs <dig> at day  <dig> in dba/ <dig> mice facilitates inflammatory responses that contribute to resistance to c. immitis infection, but may also contribute to the long term damage to the lung of dba/ <dig> mice that eventually leads to their death  <cit> . downregulation of lyve <dig> in dba/ <dig> versus c57bl/ <dig> mice is also consistent with a stronger inflammatory response in dba/ <dig> mice following c. immitis infection. johnson et al. <cit>  previously demonstrated that an inflammatory response induced in primary human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells through treatment with tnf-α led to the downregulation of lyve <dig> at the transcriptional level. the lyve <dig> gene codes for a type i integral membrane receptor that was thought to function in hyaluronan clearance and hyaluronan-mediated leukocyte adhesion, although this biological role has not been confirmed in knockout mice  <cit> . consistent with the role of tnf-α in modulating expression of both of these genes  we found that tnf-α was more highly expressed in dba/ <dig> mice at day  <dig> by both microarray  and rt-qpcr analysis .

protein interaction network analysis identified the transcription factor hif1a as a network hub. hif1a was upregulated to a greater extent at day  <dig> in resistant dba/ <dig> versus susceptible c57bl/ <dig> mice, and this was confirmed by rt-qpcr . previously it was thought that the only regulation of hif activity was the result of hypoxia increasing hif-1α levels post-transcriptionally by inhibition of proteosomal degradation of the protein following prolyl hydroxylation  <cit> , but nf-κb also induces hif1a expression at the transcriptional level  <cit> . since tnf-α can stimulate nf-κb activity  <cit> , this implies there is cross talk between nf-κb, tnf-α, and hif-1α, even under normoxic conditions. since both mouse strains had pneumonia and we did not measure oxygen saturations, we cannot exclude an influence of a hypoxia-induced increase in hif-1α in the lungs of both strains after infection. however, c57bl/ <dig> mice were clearly afflicted with more extensive lung disease  so this strain might be expected to mount a stronger hypoxic response leading to higher levels of hif-1α. since there was more expression of hif1a mrna in dba/ <dig> mice at day  <dig>  it appears that the stronger induction of hif1a in dba/ <dig> mice may be independent of hypoxia. hypoxia and inflammation occur in human patients infected with c. immitis <cit>  and both those conditions are known to increase levels of the hif-1α protein  <cit> . it is quite likely that hypoxia and inflammation act synergistically to increase the level of hif-1α in this infection, as it has in other models of infection in mice  <cit> .

cox and magee  <cit>  noted that spleen cells from dba/ <dig> mice previously infected with c. immitis and stimulated with formalin-killed spherules produced higher levels of tnf-α than c57bl/ <dig> mice. furthermore, our previous studies have shown that tnf-α deficient mice cannot be successfully immunized with a live, attenuated vaccine strain of c. immitis <cit> . given the central role of tnf-α in the inflammatory response it is not surprising that the inhibition of this cytokine is a risk factor for the dissemination of c. immitis in human patients  <cit> . these observations suggest that tnf-α plays a beneficial role in resistance to coccidioidomycosis, perhaps through activation of nf-κb and hif-1α. encouragingly, tnfa, hif1a and a transcriptional target of hif1a  were all upregulated to a greater extent in dba/ <dig> compared to c57bl/ <dig> mice at day  <dig> . this suggests the following activation cascade: tnfa → nf-κb → hif1a → il6; where nf-κb is primarily regulated at the protein level by degradation of inhibitory ikb proteins and not upregulated at the transcriptional level  <cit> . however, this result must be interpreted with care since by day  <dig>  tnfa, hif1a, and il <dig> are upregulated in c57bl/ <dig> mice to a greater extent than in dba/ <dig> mice . cytokines promoting th <dig> development  and those secreted from th <dig> cells   <cit>  exhibited a similar pattern of gene expression, i.e., upregulated in dba/ <dig> at day  <dig> followed by a receding difference  or a reversal in differential expression  at day  <dig> . recently cole et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that loss of a functional th <dig> receptor resulted in decreased protection of c57bl/ <dig> mice immunized with an attenuated mutant vaccine of c. posadasii and subsequently challenged with a virulent strain. it is plausible that an early inflammatory response coupled with the development of th <dig> immune responses at day  <dig> contributes to the resistance of dba/ <dig> to infection with c. immitis. however, it is plausible that by day  <dig> there was so much infection in c57bl/ <dig> lungs that il- <dig> and tnf-α levels increased so that they were more highly expressed in c57bl/ <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the immune response as mediated by type ii ifn  is clearly greater in the strain of mice that better controlled c. immitis infection. this adds support to the anecdotal report of successful treatment of patients suffering from coccidioidomycosis with ifn-γ therapy  <cit> . modulation of hif-1α responses that are associated with inflammation and hypoxia may also contribute to the resistance of dba/ <dig> mice to this fungal pathogen. future work will focus on a more finely graded time course in order to fully characterize the genes differentially expressed between dba/ <dig> and c57bl/ <dig> mice strains. recently, deep sequencing methods  have been proposed to analyze the expression of genes in the entire transcriptome  <cit> . while rna-seq analysis would not change the central findings of this paper, it is a more sensitive digital technique that might identify a greater number of genes, as well as alternatively spliced variants, that may be differentially expressed between dba/ <dig> and c57bl/ <dig> mice.
