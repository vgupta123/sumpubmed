BACKGROUND
haemophilus parasuis causes glässer’s disease in pigs, with symptoms of pneumonia, fibrinous polyserositis, pericarditis, polyarthritis, and meningitis  <cit> . h. parasuis can be isolated from the nasal passages of asymptomatic swine as well as those with septicemia and pneumonia without polyserositis. due to lack of protective immunity to h. parasuis, introduction of conventionally raised pigs into segregated early weaning  herds may result in infection and high economic losses  <cit> . losses in  <dig> were approximately $ <dig> million according to the national animal health monitoring system  report  <cit>  and rodney b. baker .

h. parasuis comprises  <dig> serovars based on immunodiffusion assays which use heat-stable antigens  <cit> . serovars  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are considered highly virulent, resulting in piglet death within four days. serovars  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are moderately virulent, causing polyserositis but not death. serovars  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are considered avirulent and yield no clinical disease or lesions at necropsy. many field isolates of h. parasuis are nontypeable   <cit> .

the observed heterogeneity in bacteria are in part responses to environmental stress or host defense mechanisms, which select for deletions and rearrangements in the bacterial genome which can alter virulence and broaden host range  <cit> . additionally, some heterogeneity among h. parasuis isolates is due to the acquisition of new dna through bacteriophage transduction into the host chromosome  <cit> , which is a common mechanism for bacterial genetic diversity. for example, approximately 50% of strain-specific genomic dna of escherichia coli o <dig> sakai has been attributed to lateral gene transfer through bacteriophage sequence acquisition  <cit> . these results imply that bacteriophages may be instrumental in the emergence of new e. coli strains and contribute to the genomic diversity of the species.

h. parasuis serotype  <dig> has been described as a highly virulent strain. this report describes a bacteriophage, named sumu, isolated from a field isolate of h. parasuis serotype  <dig>  sumu is a double-stranded dna bacteriophage of the caudovirales  order, myoviridae family, and the mu-like virus genus. sumu is a bacteriophage that is related to enterobacteriophage mu. enterobacteriophage mu is able to insert itself randomly via transposition at any point in the host chromosome and frequently causes mutations by interrupting the bacterial transcription at the site of the insertion. mu-like bacteriophages are thought to carry virulence genes or can induce host expression of virulence genes  <cit> . a mu-like bacteriophage gene of sumu was associated with virulence in h. parasuis, the only swine bacteria that harbor mu-like bacteriophages  <cit> . in this recent report  <cit> , the mu-like portal gene of bacteriophage sumu was detected in  <dig> of  <dig> virulent field strains of h. parasuis. the sumu bacteriophage was characterized here by dna sequencing and proteomic identification of the bacteriophage proteins. dna sequences were converted to proteins and protein homologies of enterobacteriophage mu and bacteriophage sumu were compared.

RESULTS
bacteriophage preparation
bacteriophage was obtained from lysed cultures of h. parasuis field isolate 34086b  <cit>  by a two-step centrifugation procedure. because the time of lysis was variable, the cultures were allowed to “autolyse”, as determined by a decrease in optical density at 600 nm of  <dig> - <dig>  absorbance units, prior to harvesting at  <dig> to 48 h. bacteriophage preparations contained approximately  <dig> x  <dig> to  <dig> x  <dig> pfu per ml of culture supernatant as determined by plaque assay.

electron microscopy
electron microscopy was used to determine bacteriophage morphology. electron micrographs of bacteriophage associated with h. parasuis field strain 23806b are shown in figure  <dig>  the digitally measured average icosahedral head width was  <dig>  +/− <dig>  nm and the average tail sheath length was  <dig>  +/− <dig>  nm. figure 1a shows a 7 h lysate of three bacteria with many icosahedral bacteriophage heads attached. a dashed box outlines a portion of figure  <dig> which is magnified in figure 1b. black arrows identify selected icosahedral bacteriophage heads in figure 1b. an electron-dense dna-filled head  and tail sheath  attached to bacteria from an overnight lysate are shown in figure 1cc. refractive indices  of the collected cesium chloride gradient bands were between  <dig>  and  <dig> , which correspond to densities of approximately  <dig>  g/ml. essentially no bacteriophages were seen by electron microscopy after the cesium chloride step gradient centrifugation procedure. this may have partially been due to background problems.

cloning and dna sequencing
the genomic sequence of sumu was obtained from a single cloned fragment of purified bacteriophage dna and represents the mu-like bacteriophage in h. parasuis 34086b. from approximately thirty spin-column purified clones, only three contained inserts. all three inserts were submitted for dna sequencing. the first insert was 700–800 bp in length and its peptide had 32% identity over  <dig> amino acids to mu i . the other two inserts were identical and were 461 bp in length. their peptides had 30% identity over  <dig> amino acids to mu gp <dig> .

ultracentrifuged, amplified bacteriophage was used as additional template for genomic dna. the bacteriophage genome was sequenced by using overlapping primers to previously sequenced dna and primer walking with 2- to 15-fold coverage of the dna. sequencing through variable terminal repeats was accomplished by redesigning primers and sequencing unique pcr segments of bacteriophage dna that could be inserted into the genome assembly. a homolog to is <dig> with a mule transposase domain was found at cds  <dig> . <dig>  inverted repeats were located at bp  <dig>  and bp  <dig> ; bp  <dig>  and bp  <dig> ; bp  <dig>  and bp  <dig> . direct repeats were located at bp  <dig> and bp  <dig> .

the g + c content of the bacteriophage was  <dig> %, while the g + c content of its h. parasuis 34086b host bacteria was  <dig> %. the genome size of h. parasuis bacteriophage was  <dig>  bp. significant portions of the bacteriophage sumu and enterobacteriophage mu dnas were dissimilar. only  <dig> % of their dna sequences matched and overall there was  <dig> % amino acid homology over  <dig>  amino acids. additionally, a partial hemolysin gene   was detected  <dig>  bp upstream of the putative sumu repressor gene .

protein homologies of bacteriophage sumu
fifty four potential coding regions of bacteriophage sumu and one insertion sequence were identified by using tblastx analysis  <cit>  . seventeen of the potential coding regions were homologous to enterobacteriophage mu proteins, as shown by the bars in shades of red connecting the respective bacteriophage genes . scattered lines  represent homologies that are not within genes but which indicate additional recombination events between the two bacteriophages. twenty five of the  <dig> potential proteins were homologs of mu-like proteins using ncbi’s open reading frame finder mining tool  <cit>    <cit>   .

the comparison between bacteriophage sumu and enterobacteriophage mu proteins  revealed homologies with transcription regulators and transposases  as well as high homologies , with the host-nuclease inhibitor protein gam and structural proteins, including portal protein , mu f , mu i , gpt , and gp <dig>  there was low homology  to gp <dig>  gpg, gp <dig>  baseplate assembly protein , gp <dig>  and com, a translational regulator of mom. there was negligible homology  to the sumu tape measure protein tp <dig> and to the tail fiber protein .

the comparison of bacteriophage sumu to mu-like bacteriophages by blastp analysis  showed greater amino acid homologies than there was to the mu enterobacteriophage. e-values were higher and more proteins of mu-like bacteriophages were homologous to bacteriophage sumu than there were to enterobacteriophage mu. overall bacteriophage sumu had  <dig> % homology over  <dig>  amino acids of the other mu-like bacteriophages.

protein analysis by mass spectrometry
one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis of the tca-treated bacteriophage preparation and bhi medium-only control sample were processed by mass spectrometry. the twenty proteins identified based on the masses of their tryptic fragments are listed in additional file 3; table s <dig>  all of the bacteriophage protein homologs were from bacteriophages in the myoviridae family except for two tape measure proteins from the siphoviridae family. only one of the  <dig> mass spectra submitted to pride was identified as a peptide .

fifteen of the  <dig> bacteriophage proteins identified by mass spectrometry are homologs of structural bacteriophage proteins according to blastp analysis  <cit> . a total of  <dig> bacteriophage tail structural protein homologs were identified; among these were the bacteriophage tape measure protein, which functions in determination of bacteriophage tail length ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively). homolog  <dig>  is a transglycosylase related to the bacteriophage tape measure protein, tp <dig> family. the bacteriophage protein gp <dig>  homologous to the long tail fiber receptor recognizing protein , allows the specific attachment of the bacteriophage to the bacteria and specifies the host range of the bacteriophage. other bacteriophage proteins, homologs involved in attachment to the host cell’s lipopolysaccharide include the tail fiber protein, and gp <dig>  respectively ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively). the bacteriophage tail sheath protein , homologs  <dig>  and  <dig> , may form the outer contractile sheath of the capsid tail. the baseplate wedge protein homolog  <dig>  may connect the tail fiber to the baseplate and trigger tail contraction after virus attachment to the host cell. the portal protein , protease , major head protein , mu f protein , homologs  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively, are involved in bacteriophage morphogenesis  <cit> .

two proteins were similar to proteins in the ncbi database which were putatively associated with lysogeny and lysis functions of other bacteriophages, namely ner protein and muramidase. the dna binding protein ner regulates transcription of the genome of enterobacteriophage mu . the muramidase, homolog  <dig> , may be involved in host cell lysis. three proteins  are probably involved in integration and replication of the bacteriophage: transposase a , prophage integrase , and dna transposition protein b , respectively. thirteen of the proteins identified by mass spectrometry were also found in blast searches for protein homologies to dna sequences between bacteriophage sumu and enterobacteriophage mu  or other mu-like bacteriophages .

bacteriophage sumu sequences in h. parasuis 34086b genomic dna compared to the nr database
potential sumu-like sequences of h. parasuis 34086b were compared to the ncbi non-redundant  database using the blastn algorithm in order to determine if there were matches to the bacteriophage sumu sequences. h. parasuis 34086b genomic dna segments were homologous to the following bacteriophage sumu dna segments with e-values of  <dig> : partial hemolysin-transposase , transposase-hypothetical protein  <dig> , hypothetical protein 25-duf <dig> , duf1804-terminase , gp <dig> , gpg-gp <dig> , dna circulation protein n-gp <dig> c-terminal protein . h. parasuis 34086b mu-f-like dna  and is <dig>  were also homologous to bacteriophage sumu dna, with e-values of 2e- <dig> and 9e- <dig>  respectively.

putative rearrangement of sumu prophage dna in h. parasuis 34086b. the chromosomal mu-like sequences were discontinuous except for one putative prophage sumu sequence. the sequence of the h. parasuis 34086b dna revealed a putative rearrangement of dna involving the prophage. there was a deletion of the prophage sumu genes gp37-c-terminal through its end at is <dig> . another deletion of 6121 bp occurred between hypothetical protein  <dig> and duf <dig> of prophage sumu , where an is <dig> element was inserted.

discussion
the study reported here describes the genomic and proteomic analysis of a bacteriophage isolated from a virulent field strain of h. parasuis. the genome size of the h. parasuis bacteriophage  is  <dig>  bp and is comparable to the genome sizes of enterobacteriophage mu of e. coli k- <dig> , h. influenzae bacterio-phage flumu , and the neisseria meningitidis mu-like bacteriophage pmn <dig>   <cit>  .

bacteriophage sumu’s morphology is similar to amber mutants of enterobacteriophage mu described by grundy and howe  <cit> . an icosahedral head and tail sheath were seen in bacteriophage sumu by electron microscopy. our lysates were stored at 4°c for over a week before electron microscopy. few intact virions for this bacteriophage were found probably due to their disintegration upon storage. these findings are in agreement with those of summer et al.  <cit> , who found that phage  <dig>  particles were unstable in lysates, had decreasing titers with storage, and showed disintegrating particles with broken heads, and partially exposed tails in electron micrographs.

although bands were observed after cesium chloride centrifugation at the refractive indices  reported by grundy and howe  <cit> , no bacteriophages were detected by electron microscopy. our sm broth had 50% less concentrations of tris–hcl and magnesium than the final buffer used by grundy and howe  <cit> . we also removed the cesium chloride by ultrafiltration rather than by dialysis. these methods may have also affected the stability of the bacteriophages. however, our electron micrographs clearly showed bacteriophage particles attached to the bacteria in figure  <dig> and figure 1b.

the g + c content of the h. parasuis bacteriophage sumu at  <dig> % is similar to the g + c content of the virulent h. parasuis . this close match is also seen in the g + c contents of the mu-like bacteriophage pmn <dig>  and its host genome n. meningitidis type a strain z <dig> , and enterobacteriophage mu  and the e. coli k- <dig> genome   <cit> . in contrast, the g + c content of h. influenzae mu-like bacteriophage flumu is approximately 50%, compared to 38% g + c of the h. influenzae rd chromosome  <cit> .

a comparison of the bacteriophage sumu translated nucleotide sequence obtained from its cloned dna to the enterobacteriophage mu translated nucleotide sequence using the artemis comparison tool  revealed that the conserved genes generally were related to lysogeny and lysis, integration and transposition, morphogenesis, and tail proteins. interestingly, similar bacteriophage sequences were also present in two published h. parasuis genomes. thirty nine of the  <dig> bacteriophage sumu genes were homologous to dna sequences from h. parasuis strain  <dig>  or h. parasuis sh <dig>  <cit> . bacteriophage genes were also reported as upregulated by melnikow et al.  <cit>  using a microarray analysis of the h. parasuis genome after growing h. parasuis strain  <dig> under iron-limiting, oxygen-limiting, heat, and acidic conditions. the highest gene homologs found were bacteriophage transposase , bacteriophage mu t protein homolog , and bacteriophage mu i protein gp <dig> .

the partial hemolysin gene found upstream of the sumu putative bacteriophage repressor gene  was  <dig> % similar  to hhdb, which encodes a hemolysin activation/secretion protein  of h. parasuis sh <dig>  serovar  <dig>  others have reported a putative hemolysin gene operon, hhdba, in pigs infected with h. parasuis <cit> . the bacteriophage sumu partial hemolysin gene was probably a remnant of the h. parasuis 34086b host chromosome, which could have been acquired by an illegitimate recombination event.

however, the partial hemolysin gene homolog was not found in the h. parasuis draft  <dig>  serovar  <dig> genome . given the draft nature of the h. parasuis  <dig> genome, it is possible that assembly breaks, which are not uncommon at bacteriophage and repetitive sequences, may have prevented the annotation of a hemolysin gene if one is present.

the bacteriophage sumu protease contained a significant deletion  compared to the mu i bacteriophage protease. the other two initial inserts of cloned dna had deletions of  <dig> amino acids when they were compared to the mu gp <dig> sequence.

as has been reported in the literature  <cit> , a bacteriophage may contribute to the virulence of its host. avian pathogenic e. coli causes respiratory infection and septicemia of poultry, involving bacteriophage-related sequences coding for proteins such as dna stabilization, portal, and integrase proteins  <cit> . bacteriophage sumu gp <dig> and gp <dig> are a homologs of enterobacteriophage mu gp <dig> and gp <dig>  found in h. influenzae rd  <cit> . sumu gp <dig> and gp <dig> are also homologous to two genomic fragments identified by townsend et al.  <cit>  which hybridize to virulent hemorrhagic septicemia isolates of p. multocida <cit> , but not to other p. multocida isolates. translated dna of one fragment  of p. multocida identified by townsend et al.  <cit>  had 62% homology  <cit>  over  <dig> aa to sumu_ <dig>  similar to gp <dig> of enterobacteriophage mu  by blastp analysis  <cit> . the other translated dna fragment   <cit>  had 72% homology over  <dig> aa to sumu_ <dig>  similar to enterobacteriophage mu gp <dig> . sumu proteins may also be associated with virulence in swine infected with h. parasuis carrying the sumu bacteriophage  <cit> .

canchaya et al.  <cit>  have reviewed work on lysogenic conversion. some bacteriophages carry dna that can alter the phenotype of the bacterial host  and this lysogeny is a form of short-term bacterial evolution. when lysogenic gram-negative bacteria were grown in animals, the bacteriophage-specific genes were upregulated in the bacteria  <cit> . this study described mu-like genes that mirrored those found in enterobacteriophage mu and mumenb, a bacteriophage of n. meningitidis strain mc <dig>  <cit> . corresponding mu-like genes found in mu, mumenb and sumu  included mu a, mu b, gp <dig>  gp <dig>  mu g, mu i, gp <dig>  gp <dig>  gpl, mu m, gp <dig>  gp <dig>  gp <dig>  and gp <dig>  two strains of h. parasuis, strain  <dig>  <cit>  and strain sh <dig>  <cit> , whose genomes have been sequenced, also carry mu-like bacteriophages. the mu-like bacteriophage genbank nz_abmk <dig>  ctg_ <dig> sequence of strain  <dig> is similar to that of the sumu dna sequence. the tail assembly protein of n. meningitidis  has been postulated to be membrane-associated. in these studies  <cit> , the authors hypothesized that bacteriophage-encoded membrane-associated proteins of h. influenzae and n. meningitidis contributed to the variability of the bacterial envelope structure and may therefore influence the virulence and pathogenicity of the organisms.

dna sequencing revealed a peptidoglycan recognition protein  which hydrolyzes peptidoglycans of bacterial cell walls at the analogous position of the lysis protein of enterobacteriophage mu. mass spectrometry also suggested a lysozyme/muramidase/endolysin.

the mass spectrometry analysis of the proteins from the 2-d gel suggested that h. parasuis strain 34086b may contain more than one bacteriophage as was shown by others. for example, h. parasuis strain sh <dig>  <cit>  also carries lambda, p <dig>  and cp-933 k bacteriophage genes while strain  <dig>  <cit>  has remnants of lambda, cp4-57-like, p4-like, phi-c <dig>  cp-933 c, and lj <dig> bacteriophage genes. however, the sumu genome sequence was based on cloned dna and contained only one bacteriophage.

bacteriophage sumu was putatively distantly related to the enterobacteriophage mu by combined dna and proteomic evidence. only  <dig> out of  <dig> putative proteins were more than 50% homologous between enterobacteriophage mu and bacteriophage sumu. the percent homology and e-values associated with them when comparing their translated nucleotides and their proteins was low compared to similar comparisons of bacteriophage sumu to other mu-like bacteriophages. these results are in agreement with the evolutionary diversity of bacteriophages  <cit> . although the double-stranded dna tailed-bacteriophages are extremely diverse, they share common modules, such as terminase and portal proteins as well as tail proteins  <cit> . either by illegitimate recombination or by integrase-mediated site specific recombination, a structural gene operon can be changed so it is not homologous to other genes in related bacteriophages  <cit> . the presence of variable terminal sequences in bacteriophage sumu supports the classification of it as a mu-like bacteriophage. the rearrangement of sumu prophage sequences in h. parasuis 34086b is corroborated by a report of campmu prophages mediating genomic rearrangements in campylobacter jejuni <cit> . since bacteriophage sumu’s g + c content is not much different than its host’s chromosome g + c content, it can be concluded that sumu has been associated with h. parasuis for a relatively long length of time  <cit> .

based on the results of others  <cit> , it is suggested that some virulent bacteria harbor bacteriophages while many avirulent organisms do not have genome-associated bacteriophage. our recent study  <cit>  showed the distribution of sumu’s mu-like portal bacteriophage gene, gp <dig>  among  <dig> reference strains and  <dig> field isolates of h. parasuis. the gene was present in most of the virulent isolates and absent in most of the avirulent isolates. this nested pcr assay detected  <dig> of  <dig> field isolates designated as virulent and five of six reference strains designated as virulent by utilizing the gp <dig> gene of bacteriophage sumu.

since the bacteriophage sumu genes and proteins identified are related to bacteriophage mu, they could potentially confer the necessary factors for this bacteriophage to be able to transduce virulence factors, which could affect the epidemiology of h. parasuis field isolates  <cit> . a potential diagnostic test such as a bacteriophage-specific pcr test was developed to assay for the presence of bacteriophage genes in bacterial isolates from h. parasuis-infected animals  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this is the first report on the characterization of a bacteriophage of a virulent field strain of h. parasuis named sumu  by dna sequencing and by 1-d and 2-d sds-page electrophoresis of bacteriophage proteins, followed by mass spectrometry. fifty five open reading frames were identified, correspon-ding to fifty four putative bacteriophage sumu proteins, seventeen of which were related to enterobacteriophage mu and twenty five of which were related to other mu-like bacteriophages. the last open reading frame in bacteriophage sumu corresponded to is <dig>  proteomic technologies identified twenty homologs of bacteriophage proteins. the combined dna and proteomic evidence suggests that bacteriophage sumu and the enterobacteriophage mu are putatively distantly related. it appears that this mu-like bacteriophage of h. parasuis may code for at least one potential bacterial virulence factor  which may contribute to septicemia in swine  <cit> . since the bacteriophage sumu genes and proteins identified are related to enterobacteriophage mu, they could potentially confer the necessary factors for this bacteriophage to be able to transduce virulence factors  <cit> , which could affect the epidemiology of h. parasuis field isolates.
