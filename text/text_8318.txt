BACKGROUND
worldwide the number of cases of invasive disease caused by haemophilus influenzae serotype b  has dramatically decreased after the introduction of vaccines composed of the conjugated polysaccharide capsule of the pathogen. in the netherlands hib vaccination was introduced in  <dig> resulting in a decrease in incidence of invasive hib disease among children younger than  <dig> years of age from  <dig>  per  <dig>  in  <dig> to  <dig>  in  <dig>  <cit> .

despite nearly complete vaccine coverage, a small number of fully vaccinated children in the netherlands have experienced invasive hib disease. in  <dig> the incidence of vaccine failures in dutch children aged 0– <dig> years increased from  <dig>  per  <dig>  in the years  <dig> to  <dig> to  <dig>  per  <dig>  in  <dig>  <cit> . in only a few patients underlying conditions were found that might have contributed to vaccine failure. half of the patients had adequate anti-prp titers at the onset of disease, which is similar to what is found in the same age group of the healthy population. all vaccine failure patients responded well to revaccination with the hib vaccine yielding high anti-prp titers, indicating there was no impairment of the immune system. since  <dig> the annual number of cases of invasive hib disease among 0– <dig> year old children in the netherlands has remained approximately the same  <cit> .

in the united kingdom a somewhat more pronounced rise in vaccine failures has been observed particularly in children 1– <dig> years of age and this was believed to be caused by inadequate antibody titers against hib due to waning immunity. to compensate for the reduced antibody titers, a catch-up campaign, designed to boost immunity in children aged  <dig> months to  <dig> years of age, was implemented in the united kingdom  <cit> . furthermore, an additional hib booster in the second year of life has now been implemented in the united kingdom vaccination schedule  <cit> . a hib booster vaccination at  <dig> months of age has been part of the dutch hib vaccination schedule since its introduction in  <dig>  this booster should have prevented waning immunity in children and suggests that reduced antibody titers may not have been the cause of the increased number of vaccine failures observed in the netherlands. therefore, changes in the properties, e.g. virulence factors, of circulating hib strains could not excluded. the major virulence factor of hib is the polysaccharide capsule, a polymer of ribose ribitol phosphate , which is also the antigen used for hib vaccination. the production and export of the polysaccharide capsule of hib is encoded by  <dig> genes located in single locus consisting of  <dig> distinct regions. the first region contains  <dig> bex genes involved in the export of the capsular polysaccharide, the second region carries  <dig> bcs genes which are considered to be involved in the actual synthesis of the polysaccharide and the third region carrying  <dig> hcs genes is now also considered to be involved in the export of the polysaccharide to the surface of the cell  <cit> .

changes of the genes in the capsular gene cluster locus may lead to an altered capsule of the hib. if this would be the case in the currently circulating hib strains the vaccine induced immunity may not provide optimal protection causing an increased incidence of invasive hib disease among vaccinated children in the netherlands. this prompted us to analyze the composition of the genes encoding for capsular polysaccharide, the structure of the encoded polysaccharide and of the level of expressed capsular polysaccharide in hib strains isolated before and after the introduction of nationwide hib vaccination in the netherlands.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of the hib capsule locus
the dna sequence of the locus carrying the genes encoding the components required to synthesize and export the capsular polysaccharide was determined. sequencing of the complete capsular gene cluster was performed on  <dig> hib strains isolated from dutch patients with invasive disease, on reference strain eagan and on strain  <dig> which has been used for the production of the hib conjugate vaccine . the  <dig> clinical isolates were selected because they represented pre- and post-vaccination strains and because they were isolated from vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients of various ages. analysis revealed that the dna sequence of the complete  <dig> kb capsule gene cluster was identical among  <dig> of the  <dig> dutch hib strains. the gene cluster of the divergent hib strain, isolated from an  <dig> months old non-vaccinated patient in  <dig>  differed considerably from that of the other  <dig> strains . we designated strains with the composition of the gene cluster found in the  <dig> strains as hib type i and the strain with the aberrant gene cluster as hib type ii. sequence analysis of the gene cluster of the eagan strain and of the hib vaccine strain  <dig>  yielded sequences that were virtually identical to the dutch type ii strain, with the exception of a single, silent c→t mutation at position  <dig> of the hcsa gene. the differences between the dna sequences of the type i and type ii capsule gene clusters were restricted to bcs <dig> ), the bcs <dig> , hcsa  and hcsb  genes. the  <dig> bp deletion in the bcs <dig> gene of type ii strains results in an  <dig> amino acids loss in the c-terminal part of the product encoded by this gene. the  <dig> bp deletion of the hcsb gene was caused by a  <dig> bp deletion in the intergenic region between hcsa and hcsb, resulting in the loss of the atg start codon of hcsb. however, a c→g snp created a new start codon in the now  <dig> bp shorter hcsb gene. as a result hcsb in type ii strains have an  <dig> amino acid shorter signal sequence.

comparison with the sequences in the publicly available databases revealed that sequences of the capsule gene clusters from  <dig> different hib strains have been published  <cit> . although the sequences were not identical, they were highly similar  and it was clear that the capsule gene cluster in one of these  <dig> strains, a hib minus strain isolated from a patient in the usa, is of type i . the capsule gene clusters of the other  <dig> strains, a regular hib strain and a hib minus strain, have a type ii composition . currently, the sanger institute, in collaboration with dr. derrick crook and prof. richard moxon, is sequencing the genome of a hib isolate  from a meningitis patient from the united kingdom  <cit> . the nucleotide sequence of the capsular genes in the unfinished genome sequence of this strain  <dig> is identical to that of the type i capsular gene cluster found in the dutch strains.

distribution of hib type i and type ii strains
the availability of the dna sequence of the  <dig> types of capsular gene clusters enabled us to design  <dig> primer sets targeting hcsa that could discriminate between the two capsular genotypes in a pcr. this pcr was used to analyze  <dig> hib isolates obtained from patients with invasive hib disease in the netherlands. of  <dig> strains isolated during the period 1983– <dig> and of  <dig> strains isolated during the period 1996– <dig>  a type ii associated hcsa gene was found in  <dig>  and  <dig>  isolates, respectively , yielding a statistically highly significant difference in distribution . remarkably, with the exception of a single hib strain isolated in  <dig>  type ii strains were not detected among the hib strains isolated after  <dig>  which is only  <dig> years after the introduction of the hib vaccine in the national vaccination program. the type ii hib strain isolated in  <dig> was isolated from a  <dig> months old, non-vaccinated chinese child that was adopted by dutch parents and did not represent an endogenous strain. all type ii strains were isolated from non-vaccinated children ranging from 0– <dig> years of age, not a single type ii strain was isolated from a patient older than  <dig> years of age. again this difference in distribution is statistically significant . there was no statistically significant association between the distribution of the capsular genotypes and the materials from which they were isolated .

assessment by the type i and type ii specific pcrs of a collection of hib strains isolated during the pre-vaccination period between  <dig> and  <dig> from patients in various regions in the world revealed remarkable differences in geographic distribution of type i and type ii . of the  <dig> dutch hib isolates from this time period  <dig> were type ii . none of the  <dig> hib isolates from patients from other parts of europe carried the type ii hcsa gene. the proportion of the type ii strains among the strains from the various global regions varied from 47% for strains from the african continent, 4% for asian strains, 8% in strains from australia and 43% of the isolates from cuba. however, the largest proportion of type ii strains was found among hib strains isolated from patients in the united states where  <dig> of the  <dig> strains were type ii .

sequence variation of the hcsa gene
we found only  <dig> variants of the capsule gene cluster in the  <dig> strains from which the complete gene cluster was sequenced, suggesting very limited variation of the capsular genes. to verify this finding we determined the dna sequence of hcsa pcr products obtained from a large number of type i and type ii strains. in total the dna sequences of the hcsa pcr products obtained from  <dig> dutch type i strains collected during the time period  <dig> to  <dig> were determined. the dna sequences of  <dig> of the  <dig> pcr products were identical. only two strains, one isolated in  <dig> from a  <dig> year old patient and the other in  <dig> from  <dig> months non-vaccinated old child, had an a→g snp at position  <dig> of the type i hcsa gene that did not lead to an amino acid substitution. the dna sequences of the hcsa pcr products from all  <dig> type ii strains in the strain collection were determined and all products had identical sequences. in addition, the sequences of the hcsa pcr products of  <dig> type i and  <dig> type ii hib strains collected during the pre-vaccination era in various other parts of the world were also determined. this revealed very limited variation in the hcsa sequence of type i strains. as, the a→g snp at position  <dig> of the type i hcsa gene which was also found in the dutch hib strains, appeared to be present in a strain from south-africa, in one from malaysia, one from vietnam and in  <dig> strains from the usa. furthermore,  <dig> strains from cuba contained  <dig> snps: an a→g snp at position  <dig> and a c→a snp at position  <dig>  both base pair changes lead to amino acid substitutions. remarkably, these snps correspond to the sequences found in the type ii hcsa gene. all pcr products obtained from the  <dig> type ii strains had sequences identical to the previously determined type ii hcsa sequence.

association between capsular type and genotype
assessing  <dig> of the dutch hib strains by mlva  <cit> , revealed that the type ii strains were not randomly distributed among the  <dig> mlva types. of the  <dig> type ii strains,  <dig>  had mlva type  <dig> which is the predominant type among dutch strains, one strain belonged to mlva type  <dig> and the remaining  <dig> strains formed a separate branch of mlva types not found among type i strains . of the collection of dutch strains available,  <dig> hib strains were analyzed by mlst  <cit>  and none of the  <dig> type ii strains among this collection were of sequence type  <dig> , which was by far the predominant sequence type  among the  <dig> hib strains . this suggested an inverse relationship between capsule locus type ii and st- <dig>  to assess such a possible inverse relationship we amplified and subsequently sequenced the mlst fuck locus for all  <dig> type ii hib strains from our collection, including strains isolated in other countries. all strains with a fuck allele other than allele number  <dig> were classified as not having st- <dig>  only a few type ii hib strains yielded fuck allele  <dig> and for these strains the mlst pgi locus was amplified and subsequently sequenced. none of these strains carried pgi allele  <dig>  as pgi allele  <dig> and fuck allele  <dig> are part of the st- <dig> allelic profile this showed that none of the type ii isolates had st- <dig>  demonstrating an absolute inverse relationship between capsule locus type ii and st- <dig> genotype for the  <dig> type ii hib strains included in this study.

composition of the capsular polysaccharide obtained from type i and type ii strains
the sequence differences between the homologous genes in the type i and type ii capsule loci prompted us to analyze the structure of capsular polysaccharides produced by type i and type ii strains. nmr analysis of polysaccharides isolated from the culture supernatant of two type i and two type ii strains showed no obvious differences between nmr spectra of the polysaccharides obtained from the two types, suggesting the structure of the polysaccharide from the two types is identical . the few very minor differences in the nmr spectra were not associated with the two capsular genotypes.

level of expression of polysaccharide capsule in type i and type ii hib strains
in order to detect differences in the level of capsule polysaccharide expression by capsule locus type i and type ii strains, polysaccharide production was assessed by an inhibition elisa. four type i and  <dig> type ii strains were analyzed to determine the level of polysaccharide production. the results showed that absorption of serum with cell fractions of the type i cultures caused more inhibition than with cells of type ii strains. using a standard curve based on inhibition with serial dilutions of purified polysaccharide, we deduced that the type i cells contained approximately twice as much capsular polysaccharide as type ii cells . this result was reproducible  and statistically significant . the culture supernatants from type i and type ii cultures contained significantly more polysaccharide than the cellular fractions. however, the amount of polysaccharide in the culture supernatant from type i strains did not differ significantly from that of type ii strains. this indicates that the amount of shed polysaccharide in type i and type ii strains is the same, but that the total amount of polysaccharide produced in type i strains is higher.

possible differences in the level of polysaccharide production were also assessed in a serum bactericidal assay. the sba was performed using heat inactivated serum obtained from adult human volunteers that were immunized with hib conjugate vaccine. serial dilutions of the serum were used in sbas using type i and type ii hib as target cells. twice as much serum was required to kill 90% of the type i target cells in the sba compared to the amount required to kill type ii target cells . remarkably, the use of type i strains as target cells yielded a more pronounced pro-zone effect than type ii strains. cell fractions of the  <dig> type i and  <dig> type ii strains used in the above described inhibition elisa were used to perform absorption of a high titer serum from a human volunteer. absorption of the serum with cells from the type i strains reduced its sba titer from 1: <dig>  to 1: <dig>  in contrast, the serum sample retained an sba titer of 1: <dig> after absorption with type ii cells . the same 4-fold difference in reduction of sba titer was observed if either type i or a type ii hib strains were used as target cells for the sba. other high titer serum samples absorbed with type i cells yielded similar results. absorption with cell fractions of isogenic type i or type ii hib minus variants did not reduce the sba titer, showing the observed reduction is caused by the polysaccharide and not by other components of the bacteria.

electron microscopy of type i and type ii strains
to determine if the observed difference in capsular expression could also be visualized on the surface of the bacterial cells, electron microscopy  was performed. for this purpose overnight grown type i  and type ii  cultures and their isogenic capsule minus variants were stained and fixed to visualize capsular structures on the surface of the cells. examination by electron microscopy revealed that type i cells had a thinner capsular layer than the cells from type ii strain . the average thickness of the capsular layer of type i cells and type ii cells was  <dig> nm  and  <dig> nm , respectively. however, the capsule of type i cells was more electron dense, appearing as a more compact layer on the cell surface compared the capsule of the type ii cells.

discussion
in this study, we determined the composition of the genes encoding the components required for the synthesis and transport of the polysaccharide capsule of hib strains isolated from patients with invasive disease in the netherlands. we found that two variants of the capsular gene cluster exist and we designated these as type i and type ii. type i strains were found to carry approximately twice as much capsular polysaccharide on the surface of the cells as did type ii strains. of the strains, isolated from patients with invasive hib disease in the netherlands during the time period 1983– <dig>  5% were type ii. after  <dig>  only  <dig> years after the introduction of the hib vaccine in the dutch national immunization program, type ii strains were no longer isolated from dutch patients with invasive hib disease.

the variation between the capsular gene cluster sequences of type i and type ii strains was predominantly found in the hcsa and hcsb genes. the nucleotide sequences of bex, bcs <dig> and bcs <dig> of type i and of type ii were identical. only one snp was found in bcs <dig> and a few snps in bcs <dig>  some of which are leading to amino acid substitutions. the bcs genes are believed to be involved in the biosynthesis of the polysaccharide and even small alterations in these genes could change the composition of the polysaccharide produced. however, nmr analysis of the polysaccharides isolated from type i and type ii strains revealed no structural differences between the two types. recently, sukupolvi-petty and colleagues demonstrated that the products of the hcsa and hcsb genes facilitate transport of capsular polysaccharide across the outer membrane  <cit> . inactivation of hcsa alone resulted in accumulation of polysaccharide in the periplasm and a partial decrease in surface-associated polysaccharide, whereas inactivation of hcsb alone or of both hcsa and hcsb resulted in accumulation of polysaccharide in the periplasm and complete loss of surface associated polysaccharide. it is therefore feasible that alterations in the hcsa and hcsb genes would influence the degree of export of the capsular polysaccharide to the surface of the hib cells or the efficiency of retaining the exported polysaccharide on the surface. we showed that the type i hcsa and hcsb genes and putative encoded proteins differed considerably in composition from those of the type ii strains. these differences did not lead to a detectable difference in structure between the two capsular genotypes. however, we provided evidence that, at least in vitro, the amount of capsular polysaccharide retained on the surface of studied type i strains was twice as high as that in type ii strains. in an inhibition elisa, cells obtained from type i cultures caused significantly more inhibition than cells from type ii cultures. similar results were obtained in an sba where absorption of serum samples with type i cells resulted in a four-fold higher reduction of sba titer compared to absorption with type ii cells. furthermore, there always was a pronounced pro-zone effect when type i strains were used in the sba while only a modest pro-zone effect was seen when type ii strains were used as target cells in the sba. the pro-zone effect is thought to reflect a steric hindrance caused by high concentrations of bound antibodies which in turn is caused by high concentrations of antigen  <cit> . this would confirm the higher density of capsular polysaccharide on the surface of type i cells. electron microscopy revealed that the capsular layers of type i hib cells were thinner, yet denser than that of type ii cells, that could suggest that in type i strains more polysaccharide may bound per surface area.

cerquetti and colleagues showed that a significantly greater proportion of strains isolated from vaccine failures in the united kingdom carried multiple copies of the cap gene cluster  <cit> . as shown by noel and colleagues, the presence of multiple copies of the cap locus would result in more polysaccharide production and decreased complement-mediated lysis  <cit> . hence, higher antibody levels may be required to protect against hib disease caused by strains with multiple copies of the cap gene cluster. we have shown that type i strains may produce more capsular polysaccharide and therefore higher antibody titers may be required to eliminate type i hib compared to type ii strains. all dutch type ii strains used in this study were exclusively isolated from non-vaccinated children younger than  <dig> years of age and consequently, all vaccine failures in the netherlands were caused by type i strains. this suggests that type ii hib strains may be less well equipped to cause invasive disease in hosts that have been immunized by vaccination or by natural exposure to hib and may explain why the type ii strains seem to have become extinct in the netherlands after the introduction of the hib vaccine. the fact that the proportion of type ii strains among the hib population before the introduction of the vaccine was only 5% possibly would have contributed to the rapid elimination.

the type i and type ii strains appear to represent two distinct groups within the hib population. this is particularly obvious from the mlst analysis of the hib strains. the hib population displays a relatively low degree of genetic diversity when analyzed by mlst. in the netherlands 75% of the hib strains typed by mlst had st- <dig>  remarkably, none of the dutch type ii strains were st- <dig>  suggesting an inverse relationship between capsular genotype ii and st- <dig>  this inverse relationship was confirmed by our finding that none of the type ii strains obtained from other countries had st- <dig>  mlva analysis of the dutch hib collection also revealed a non-random distribution of the type ii strains corroborating the distinct nature of the type ii strains.

it is unclear what has caused the polymorphism of the two gene clusters in hib strains, but it is unlikely that this reflects a gradual change in the capsular genes. dna sequence analysis of the complete capsular gene clusters of  <dig> hib strains revealed the presence of only  <dig> types of sequences. sequence analysis of a large number of hcsa pcr products obtained from dutch type i and type ii hib and from strains collected in various other parts of the world confirmed the very limited variability in type i strains and the complete lack thereof in those from type ii strains. possibly hib strains have acquired the hcsa and hcsb genes from other capsulated h. influenzae or other bacterial species through lateral transfer and recombination. thus far only the hcsa and hcsb genes of serotype b and serotype f strains have been sequenced  <cit> . comparison of the type i and type ii hcs gene sequences of the hib strains with the hcs sequences of the serotype f strain shows that these are similar but distinct sequences and that hib has not acquired the hcs genes from h. influenzae serotype f.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this investigation has shown that two variants of hib strains exist that differ considerably in the dna sequence of the genes hcsa and hcsb. these genes are involved in the transport of the major virulence factor, the capsular polysaccharide, to the surface of the hib cell. we show that the type i isolates used in this study carried more surface bound capsular polysaccharide than type ii isolates. type ii strains were isolated from 0– <dig> year old, non-vaccinated patients suggesting type ii only causes invasive disease in hosts that have not yet mounted antibodies against the hib capsule. before the introduction of the hib vaccine 5% of the hib isolates from dutch patients with invasive hib disease were type ii and after nationwide hib vaccination this type was no longer found. the lower capsule production in type ii strains may have caused a selective disadvantage explaining the rapid disappearance of type ii strains from the dutch hib population. however, this change in the composition of the hib population does not explain why the netherlands has experienced an increase in the number of vaccine failures since  <dig> and further investigation is required to explain the observed increase.
