BACKGROUND
the c. elegans gonad is a bi-lobed organ composed of the germ line and somatic distal tip cells and sheath cells that partially envelop the germ line  <cit> . the distal half of the germ line is a syncytium, with multiple germ nuclei sharing a common cytoplasm. at the distal tip of the two gonad arms, germ line stem cells interact with the distal tip cell, which maintains them in a mitotic stem cell fate   <cit> . as the nuclei proceed proximally down the germ line and lose contact with the distal tip cell niche, they exit mitosis and begin meiotic differentiation .

when the nuclei enter meiosis and arrest at pachytene in the meiotic zone, they are associated with the germ line cortex, resulting in a nucleus-free inner core of cytoplasm called the rachis  <cit> . germ line plasma membrane invaginates between the nuclei to partially enclose them, forming a characteristic "t" structure of plasma membrane surrounding the meiotic germ nuclei  <cit> . somatic sheath cells partially envelop the germ line and extend filopodia over bare regions, but do not extend protrusions deeply between germ line plasma membrane invaginations  <cit> . as pachytene nuclei reach the flexure, or bend, of the gonad arm, individual meiotic nuclei enter diakinesis and become completely enclosed by plasma membrane to complete oogenesis. oocytes are fertilized as they move proximally through the spermatheca.

in recent years, genes and signals that control mitotic stem cell character and meiotic differentiation have been identified  <cit> . lag- <dig> delta in the distal tip and glp- <dig> notch in the germ line are required to maintain the mitotic stem cell fate in the distal tip cell niche and to repress the translation of meiotic differentiation factors  <cit> . as germ nuclei leave the niche, the meiotic differentiation factors gld- <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and nos- <dig> promote meiosis and repress glp- <dig> translation and the mitotic fate  <cit> . the transition zone contains a mix of mitotic and meiotic nuclei that reorganize to the cortex to form the rachis. meiotic nuclei at the cortex arrest in pachytene until they reach the gonad flexure, where meiosis resumes and oogenesis begins. ras/map kinase signaling, including let- <dig> ras, is required for progression through pachytene and entry into diakinesis  <cit> . while much is known about meiotic specification, less is known about the molecular mechanisms that control rachis organization in the meiotic zone, although ras signaling is likely involved, as mutations in let- <dig> ras and mpk- <dig> erk cause disorganization of the pachytene region of the germline.

described here are initial studies showing that the fli- <dig> gene perturbs rachis formation without affecting meiotic progression. in fli- <dig> mutants, chains of germ nuclei were observed in the rachis of the meiotic zone, and ultrastructural analysis revealed that these nuclei remained associated with germ line plasma membrane. furthermore, extensions of the sheath cells protruded into the rachis between these misplaced nuclei. this phenotype is referred to here as a germ line morphogenesis defect . no defects in mitotic or meiotic specification were observed in the misplaced nuclei or in any germ nuclei in fli- <dig> mutants.

the fli- <dig> locus was identified and found to encode a molecule with n-terminal leucine-rich repeats  and  <dig> c-terminal gelsolin repeats, similar to the drosophila and human flightless  <dig> molecules  <cit> . c. elegans fli- <dig> can bind to and sever actin filaments  <cit> , and a fli- <dig> mutation caused defects in a variety of tissues, including germ line organization defects  <cit> . human flightless  <dig> , along with a monomer of g-actin, is a component of a transcriptional coactivator complex that acts with nuclear hormone receptors and β-catenin/tcf lef  <cit> . in drosophila, flightless  <dig> mutants display defects in flight muscle development as well as defects in nuclear organization and cellularization in the syncytial blastoderm  <cit> . thus, flightless  <dig> molecules might have distinct roles in the cytoplasm and nucleus, possibly organizing the actin cytoskeleton in the former and modulating transcription in the latter.

the let- <dig> ras molecule has been shown to control meiotic progression from pachytene to diakinesis, and let- <dig> mutations were found to have a germ line organization defect  <cit> . data presented here show that let- <dig> ras has a glm phenotype similar to fli- <dig>  and that let- <dig> ras and fli- <dig> interact genetically in germ line morphogenesis. thus, fli- <dig> and let- <dig> ras might act together to control germ line organization and rachis formation during meiotic differentiation in the c. elegans germline.

RESULTS
fli- <dig> affects germ line morphogenesis
the ky <dig> mutation was isolated in a synthetic lethal screen to identify molecules that act in parallel to the actin-binding protein unc- <dig> ablim  <cit> . unc- <dig> and fli- <dig> likely have roles in pharyngeal function underlying the synthetic lethal phenotype. pharyngeal pumping is severely reduced in unc-115; fli- <dig> double mutants, and double mutants arrest in the l <dig> larval stage consistent with a feeding defect .

alone, fli- <dig> animals were viable and fertile and displayed a slightly dumpy  body morphology. when observed using differential interference contrast  microscopy, germ line nuclei were observed in the rachis of the meiotic zone . in most cases, chains of apparently connected nuclei spanned the rachis. misplaced germ cells in the rachis were observed as soon as the rachis was evident in mid-to-late l <dig> larval animals . this phenotype is referred to here as the germ line morphogenesis  phenotype. in fli- <dig>  94% of gonad arms displayed the glm phenotype . the glm phenotype was never observed in wild-type animals.

transition from mitosis to meiosis is not disrupted in fli- <dig> mutant germ nuclei
the misplaced nuclei in the rachis of the meiotic zone in fli- <dig> might have been due to disruption in the transition of nuclei from mitosis to meiosis. a brdu incorporation was used to assay nuclei undergoing dna synthesis in the germ line    <cit> . after  <dig> minutes of exposure to brdu, wild-type animals displayed brdu-positive nuclei in the distal mitotic zone . fli-1-mutant gonads displayed a similar brdu incorporation profile , and nuclei in the rachis of the meiotic zone did not incorporate brdu. a 30-minute exposure to brdu also resulted in no apparent differences between wild-type and fli- <dig> . in sum, no differences in brdu incorporation were detected between wild-type and fli- <dig>  suggesting that misplaced nuclei in the rachis of the meiotic zone of fli- <dig> were not undergoing mitotic divisions, and that normal meiotic progression was not affected . dapi staining to assay nuclear morphology showed that misplaced nuclei in the rachis of the meiotic zone of fli- <dig> animals displayed a meiotic pachytene morphology; the pachytene chromosomes were individually visible with a "bowl of spaghetti" appearance   <cit> .

in transmission electron microscopic  cross-sections, nuclei in the meiotic zone in fli- <dig>  including misplaced nuclei, were of roughly the same size and shape as those in wild-type  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm diameter for wild-type). the misplaced nuclei in fli- <dig> had a meiotic appearance . meiotic nuclei appear round and regular as those seen in figure 3c and 3d, whereas mitotic nuclear membranes have an irregular, "wavy" appearance. these lines of evidence indicate that the transition from mitosis to meiosis is unaffected in fli- <dig> mutant germ nuclei.

the previously-published fli- <dig> allele caused defects in oocyte production and brood size  <cit> . brood size of fli- <dig> was comparable to that of wild-type  compared to  <dig> for wild type; t-test p =  <dig> ). possibly, bp <dig> is a stronger allele of fli- <dig> than is ky <dig> and affects oocyte production more strongly than ky <dig> 

germ line plasma membrane partially surrounded misplaced germ nuclei in fli-1
tem analysis revealed that wild-type meiotic zone nuclei were near the cortex. the germ line plasma membrane protruded between and partially enveloped each nucleus, forming a characteristic "t" shaped membrane described above and elsewhere   <cit> . in tem cross-sections of meiotic regions of fli- <dig>  germ line plasma membrane was clearly associated with each misplaced nucleus in the rachis, suggesting that germ line plasma membrane invaginated to partially enclose misplaced germ nuclei . a similar phenotype was observed in cross-sections of animals heterozygous for a deletion of the fli- <dig> locus called tm <dig> . no defects in the organization of the distal mitotic zone were observed in cross sections of fli- <dig> . while the shape and diameter of wild-type distal meiotic gonads was relatively uniform , fli- <dig> gonads were often of irregular diameter  and irregular shape .

sheath cell extensions were associated with misplaced nuclei in the rachis in fli-1
the plasma membrane surrounding interior nuclei in fli- <dig> formed gaps between nuclei similar to the gaps formed by plasma membrane invagination around cortical nuclei . in fli- <dig> mutants, additional membranes were frequently observed occupying these interior gaps formed by invaginated germ line plasma membrane . less frequently, electron-dense laminar structures were present in the interior gaps . cross sections of heterozygous fli-1/+ deletion animals showed a similar phenotype .

the nature of these membrane-like structures between misplaced germ cells observed by tem was unclear. the germ line is partially surrounded by the somatic sheath cells, which extend filopodia across the bare regions of the germline not covered by the cell body  <cit> . sheath cell protrusions occupy gaps between nuclei formed by germ line plasma membrane invagination. in wild-type, sheath cell protrusions do not extend deeply between nuclei but rather stay near the cortex  <cit> . possibly, the membrane-like structures between misplaced germ nuclei in fli- <dig> mutants were somatic sheath cell extensions.

to assay sheath cell morphology, a transgene consisting of the lim- <dig> promoter driving gfp expression was analyzed. lim-7::gfp is expressed in the sheath cells but not the germ line  <cit> . in wild-type harboring lim-7::gfp, no gfp fluorescence was detected in the rachis of the meiotic region , although gfp was detected at the surface of the germ line in a "honeycomb" pattern as previously described  <cit> , due to the thin cytoplasm of regions of the sheath cells covering the germ nuclei.

in fli- <dig> mutants, the cortical "honeycomb" pattern was observed, although it was often irregular and disorganized, suggesting cortical nucleus arrangement was disorganized. fingers of gfp expression were observed protruding into the rachis and associating with misplaced germ nuclei . these protrusions were from the somatic sheath cells and not the distal tip cell, as a lag-2::gfp transgene, expressed only in the distal tip cell  <cit> , did not show these patches in the rachis in fli- <dig> animals . the tem and lim-7::gfp results combined indicate that misplaced nuclei in the rachis were bounded by germ line plasma membrane, and extensions of the sheath cells protruded between the misplaced germ cells in the rachis .

fli- <dig> encodes a molecule similar to flightless 1/fliih
the ky <dig> mutation was mapped genetically to linkage group iii by standard linkage analysis with visible markers using synthetic lethality with unc- <dig> . three-factor mapping with dpy- <dig> and unc- <dig> using the glm phenotype indicated that ky <dig> was close to and to the left of unc- <dig>  . the fli- <dig> gene , which encodes an actin-binding protein of the flightless 1/fliih family, resides in this region of the genome . the fli- <dig> polypeptide is composed of n-terminal leucine-rich repeats  and  <dig> c-terminal gelsolin-like domains . a fli- <dig> cdna was isolated in a previous study  <cit>  . this transcript was used as the basis for figure 7c and 7d. the cdna is likely to contain the entire fli- <dig> coding region, as an in-frame stop codon is present  <dig> codons upstream of the presumed initiation methionine . furthermore, two independent fli- <dig> cdnas were sequenced . while incomplete at the 5' ends, these cdnas were identical in structure to the u <dig> cdna.

to test if the fli- <dig> gene is involved in germ line morphogenesis, rna-mediated gene interference  of fli- <dig> was performed. fli- <dig> phenocopied the germ line morphogenesis defect of ky <dig> . furthermore, the cosmid b <dig>  which contains the fli- <dig> gene, rescued the synthetic lethality of unc-115; fli- <dig> animals harboring a transgene containing the cosmid . the b <dig> cosmid contains two other genes, b <dig>  and b <dig> . rnai of these genes did not cause a glm phenocopy . fli- <dig> rnai in both wild-type and rrf- <dig> backgrounds caused the glm phenocopy . rrf- <dig> mutations attenuate rnai in somatic cells but do not apparently affect rnai in the germ line  <cit> .

a pcr-generated fragment of b <dig> containing only the fli- <dig> gene and a tryptophan trna  rescued the synthetic lethality of unc-115; fli- <dig> mutants . furthermore, a fli-1::gfp full-length fusion transgene  partially rescued the glm phenotype of fli- <dig> animals  as well as the lethality of unc-115; fli- <dig> double mutants. the nucleotide sequence of the entire region included in the rescuing fli- <dig> transgene was determined from ky <dig> mutants. no nucleotide changes were detected in this region in three independent pcr amplifications of the fli- <dig> gene from ky <dig> genomic dna. possibly, ky <dig> is regulatory mutation outside of the region necessary for rescue, and transgenic fli- <dig> expression, which can often lead to overexpression, can overcome the ky <dig> mutation. a fli- <dig> transcript was detected by rt-pcr in fli- <dig> mutants . as described below, the fli- <dig> locus is haploinsufficient for the glm phenotype, indicating that lowering fli- <dig> gene dosage by as little as one-half can cause the glm phenotype.

the fli- <dig> deletion causes a germ line morphogenesis defect
to confirm that fli- <dig> controls germ line morphogenesis, a deletion in the fli- <dig> locus was analyzed . the deletion, tm <dig>  removed bases  <dig> to  <dig> relative to the cosmid b <dig>  with breakpoints in coding exons  <dig> and  <dig> of fli- <dig> . the out-of-frame tm <dig> deletion removed coding region encompassing parts of gelsolin domains  <dig> and  <dig> .

fli- <dig> homozygotes from a heterozygous mother arrested during embryogenesis and failed to hatch. of arrested embryos, 70% displayed the pat phenotype  . the pat phenotype is characteristic of defects in body wall muscle function  <cit> . indeed, fli- <dig> mutants displayed slightly disorganized myofilament lattice structure in body wall muscles , suggesting that body wall muscle development was also affected by fli- <dig>  the remaining 30% of tm <dig> homozygous embryos arrested earlier in embryogenesis with severe defects in embryonic organization . defects in muscle organization and embryonic development in a fli- <dig> mutation have been described  <cit> .

while homozygous fli- <dig> animals arrested in embryogenesis, heterozygous tm362/+ animals displayed the glm phenotype similar to ky <dig> animals . tem cross sections of tm362/+ heterozygotes were analyzed and found to have a similar ultrastructural defect as described for fli- <dig> , including germ line plasma membrane and sheath cell invaginations around misplaced nuclei. these results suggest that fli- <dig> is haploinsufficient for the glm phenotype. indeed, heterozygous ky535/+ animals also displayed the glm phenotype . trans-heterozygous ky535/tm <dig> animals were viable and had a severe glm phenotype , suggesting that ky <dig> and tm <dig> failed to complement for this phenotype. however, the additive effect of each heterozygote alone could explain this effect.

the lethality of fli- <dig> was rescued by the fli- <dig> transgene that also rescued the unc-115; fli- <dig> lethality , and the glm phenotype of rescued homozygous fli- <dig> animals was significantly less severe than fli- <dig> homozygotes . the glm phenotype was likely due to fli- <dig> loss of function, as fli- <dig> rnai caused the glm phenocopy and the glm phenotype of both fli- <dig> and fli- <dig> was rescued by transgenic fli- <dig>  thus, the viable fli- <dig> allele might be hypomorphic and the lethal fli- <dig> allele might be null. if this is the case, fli- <dig> might be haploinsufficient for the glm phenotype as heterozygotes displayed the glm phenotype. it is also possible that either or both of the two fli- <dig> alleles are not simple loss-of-function alleles and thus cause a dominant glm phenotype. indeed, fli- <dig> was rescued more efficiently than ky <dig> by transgenic fli- <dig> , suggesting that ky <dig> might have some dominant character that is more difficult to rescue. in either case, the glm defect is likely a loss-of-function phenotype of fli- <dig> as rnai of fli- <dig> caused the glm defect.

germ line actin organization in fli- <dig> mutants
fli- <dig> can bind to and sever actin filaments  <cit> , suggesting that it might modulate cytoskeletal organization. the effect of fli- <dig> on the actin cytoskeleton of the germ line was analyzed by staining with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin. hermaphrodite somatic sheath cells contain much actin, which was difficult to distinguish from germ line actin. to circumvent this problem, male gonads, which lack sheath cells, were analyzed, although hermaphrodites showed a pattern consistent with that seen in males .

fli- <dig> males displayed a glm phenotype similar to hermaphrodites, as displaced nuclei were observed in the rachis of the single male gonad arm . in the wild type male germ line, a cortical layer of phalloidin staining was associated with the germ line plasma membrane that surrounded each germ nucleus . in fli- <dig>  nuclei at the cortex displayed an apparently normal actin organization. however, a cortical layer of actin was observed surrounding the misplaced nuclei in the rachis, apparently associated with the invaginated plasma membrane . while actin was associated with misplaced nuclei in fli- <dig>  no obvious defects in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton per se were observed. the fli- <dig> allele caused defects in gonad actin organization  <cit>  not seen in fli- <dig>  fli- <dig> might be a hypomorphic allele, and actin organization might not be affected to the extent observed in bp <dig> 

fli- <dig> is expressed in the gonad and in muscle
a transcriptional fli-1promoter::gfp reporter transgene was constructed that contained the fli- <dig> 5' upstream region driving gfp . expression was observed in body wall muscle, pharyngeal muscle, and vulval muscle of embryonic, larval, and adult animals . this is consistent with the pat phenotype of fli- <dig> animals and the pharyngeal pumping defects of unc-115; fli- <dig> animals. in complex arrays , expression was occasionally observed along the entire length the adult gonad in a "honeycomb" pattern characteristic of gonad expression . this expression was faint and variable  and tended to dissipate as the complex array lines were maintained for more than three generations. this pattern could reflect expression in the germ line, the somatic sheath cells, or both. male gonads, which are devoid of sheath cells, also showed faint and variable expression along their lengths , suggesting that expression might be in the germ line. however, sheath cell expression cannot be excluded from these experiments.

the full-length fli-1::gfp transgene, predicted to encode a full-length fli- <dig> polypeptide with gfp at the c-terminus, rescued fli- <dig> lethality and partially rescued the glm phenotype of fli- <dig> and fli- <dig>  suggesting the fli-1::gfp molecule was functional. no fli-1::gfp fluorescence was detected in the gonads of these transgenic animals, and muscle expression was very faint and inconsistent. possibly, fli-1::gfp was expressed at very low levels, below detection in the gonad.

to detect low levels of fli-1::gfp expression, gonads from animals expressing full-length fli-1::gfp were excised and stained with an antibody against gfp. specific gfp immunoreactivity was predominantly associated with germ nuclei . gonads from animals without the fli-1::gfp transgene showed no such reactivity . fli-1::gfp was associated with nuclei along the length of the entire gonad, and no obvious differences in fli-1::gfp accumulation or nuclear association were detected along the length of the distal gonad from the mitotic zone through the meiotic zone.

let- <dig> mutations display a germ line morphogenesis phenotype similar to fli-1
previous studies described defects in germ line organization in mutants of ras signaling pathway components: mpk- <dig> and ksr- <dig> mutations caused germ line clumping  <cit> ; and mek- <dig> and let- <dig> ras mutants displayed misplaced nuclei in the meiotic zone  <cit> . c. elegans let- <dig> is similar to human k-ras  <cit> , and has been shown to control transition of germ nuclei from meiotic pachytene to diakinesis and germ line organization  <cit> .

to begin to characterize ras signaling in the glm phenotype, alleles of let- <dig> ras that cause loss of function, constitutive activation, and dominant negative effects were analyzed for the germ line morphogenesis defect by dic optics and dapi staining   <cit> . the hypomorphic loss-of-function allele n <dig> caused a ky535-like germ line defect in 44% of gonad arms, and the stronger let- <dig> loss-of-function alleles s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig>  which are homozygous lethal, caused the glm phenotype when heterozygous . these data suggest that let- <dig> is haploinsufficient for the glm phenotype as was fli- <dig>  three different dominant-negative alleles of let- <dig> also displayed the germ line phenotype as homozygotes or as heterozygotes  . tem sections of let- <dig> showed a similar ultrastructural defect as fli- <dig> , including germ line plasma membrane and sheath cell protrusions between misplaced nuclei. furthermore, let- <dig> loss-of-function and dominant negative mutants displayed sheath cell lim-7::gfp expression associated with misplaced nuclei . while loss-of-function and dominant negative let- <dig> alleles caused the glm phenotype, constitutively-active let- <dig> alleles n <dig> and n <dig> caused little or no glm phenotype .

let- <dig> activity can compensate for loss of fli- <dig> in germ line morphogenesis
fli- <dig> and let- <dig> ras mutations cause the glm defect, and constitutively-active let- <dig> alleles, which presumably cause let- <dig> overactivation, had no apparent effect on germ line morphogenesis. the constitutively-active let- <dig> mutation partially suppressed the glm defect of fli- <dig> heterozygotes and homozygotes and fli-1/+ heterozygotes . for example, fli- <dig> heterozygotes displayed 49% defective gonad arms, reduced to 15% by heterozygous let- <dig>  let- <dig>  another constitutively-active let- <dig> mutation, suppressed the glm phenotype of fli-1/+ heterozygotes . these data indicate let- <dig> ras overactivation can partially compensate for loss of fli- <dig> function and suggest that fli- <dig> and let- <dig> ras act together to control germ line morphogenesis. possibly, fli- <dig> and let- <dig> act in the same pathway or in parallel pathways to control germ line morphogenesis. it is also possible that fli- <dig> and let- <dig> control each others' expression.

discussion
experiments described here show that mutations in fli- <dig> and let- <dig> ras affect morphogenesis of the germ line . fli- <dig> can encode an actin-binding protein similar to drosophila and human flightless- <dig> and has been shown to interact physically with human ha-ras via the leucine-rich repeats  <cit> . studies described here show that overactivity of let- <dig> ras can compensate for fli- <dig> loss-of-function in the germ line, suggesting that fli- <dig> and let- <dig> ras act together to control germ line morphogenesis.

the glm phenotype
meiotic nuclei are associated with the cortex of the germ line, forming the rachis. sheath cell filopodia protrude superficially in the gaps between germ line plasma membrane that partially surround meiotic nuclei, but they do not protrude deeply  <cit> . fli- <dig> mutants displayed interconnected chains of meiotic nuclei spanning the rachis of the meiotic zone, a configuration never seen in wild-type. these misplaced nuclei were partially surrounded by invaginations of germ line plasma membrane as were their normally-positioned counterparts at the cortex. gonadal sheath cell projections protruded between the plasma membrane invaginations and were in close proximity to the nuclei deep in the center of the rachis region . such deep sheath cell projections in the meiotic zone were never observed in wild type. in fli- <dig> mutants, the projections between misplaced nuclei in the meiotic zone were not from the distal tip cell, but were from the more proximally-located sheath cells that normally do not protrude deeply between nuclei.

misplaced chains of nuclei in fli- <dig> mutants were not due to defects in meiotic progression, as all aspects of meiosis appeared normal in fli- <dig> mutants: nuclei in the meiotic zone did not incorporate brdu, suggesting that they were post-mitotic; the morphology of misplaced nuclei was similar to normal meiotic nuclei as judged by dapi staining and by electron microscopy. thus, while fli- <dig> mutant germ nuclei apparently underwent meiosis normally, they failed to organize properly to form the rachis.

data presented here suggest that fli- <dig> affects germ line morphogenesis without affecting meiotic progression or other aspects of germ line differentiation. however, fli- <dig> is a hypomorph and fli- <dig> homozygotes arrested in embryogenesis before germ line development  heterozygotes). all fli- <dig> genotypes in which the glm phenotype was scored had some fli- <dig> activity, so it is possible that complete loss of fli- <dig> activity in the germ line would affect other aspects germ line development not apparent in these studies . possibly, fli- <dig> is required for the proper formation or maintenance of the rachis through effects on the actin cytoskeleton or the germline plasma membrane. alternatively, fli- <dig> might be part of a developmental program that coordinates rachis formation with other aspects of meiotic differentiation.

the glm phenotype might be sensitive to gene dosage
animals heterozygous for both fli- <dig> and fli- <dig> displayed the glm phenotype. let- <dig> ras was also haploinsufficient, as heterozygous let- <dig> ras loss-of-function mutations displayed the glm phenotype. these data suggest that precise dosages of fli- <dig> and let- <dig> ras are required for normal germ line morphogenesis, and that reduction by as little as one half can cause the glm phenotype. it is also possible that ky <dig> and tm <dig> are not simple loss-of-function alleles and that each might have a gain-of-function effect, explaining the glm defect of heterozygous animals. in any case, rnai of fli- <dig> results in the glm phenotype, suggesting that the glm phenotype is a consequence of loss of fli- <dig> function.

no nucleotide lesion associated with ky <dig> was detected in the region that can rescue the fli- <dig> and fli- <dig> glm phenotypes. however, ky <dig> was mapped genetically to the fli- <dig> region using the glm phenotype, and fli- <dig> rnai phenocopied the ky <dig> phenotype. furthermore, the glm phenotype of ky <dig> was rescued by a fli- <dig> transgene containing only the fli- <dig> gene. possibly, ky <dig> is a mutation outside of the rescuing region that reduces but does not abolish fli- <dig> expression, such as a mutation in a distal enhancer element. the haploinsufficiency of the fli- <dig> locus is consistent with this idea. the fli- <dig> deletion also displayed a haploinsufficient glm phenotype rescued by a fli- <dig> transgene.

fli- <dig> and let- <dig> ras might act together to control germ line morphogenesis
let- <dig> ras loss-of-function and dominant-negative mutations caused the glm phenotype similar to fli- <dig>  constitutively-active alleles of let- <dig> ras did not. previous studies showed a germ cell organization defect in let- <dig> and mpk- <dig> mutants  <cit> . mpk- <dig> caused large clumps of nuclei with regions of the germline barren of nuclei, a defect rarely seen in the fli- <dig> and let- <dig> analyses described here. possibly, the defects of fli- <dig> and mpk- <dig> are related, and mpk- <dig> has a stronger effect than fli- <dig>  alternatively, fli- <dig> and mpk- <dig> might affect distinct processes.

interestingly, the glm phenotype of fli- <dig> mutations was suppressed by constitutively-active let- <dig> ras mutations, suggesting that let- <dig> ras overactivity compensated for fli- <dig> loss of function. in these experiments, fli- <dig> activity was reduced but not eliminated . thus, it is possible that let- <dig> ras and fli- <dig> act together in the same pathway or in parallel pathways to control germ line morphogenesis. the lrrs of c. elegans fli- <dig> interact physically with human ha-ras in vitro  <cit>  suggesting that fli- <dig> and ras might act in the same pathway. another possibility is that let- <dig> controls fli- <dig> expression. indeed, microarray expression analysis indicates that fli- <dig> transcript levels are increased by constitutively-active let- <dig>  <cit> . further experiments will be required to test these models of fli- <dig> and let- <dig> interaction.

fli- <dig> is expressed in the gonad
the fli- <dig> promoter was active in muscle cells and in the gonad. anti-gfp immunofluorescence revealed that fli-1::gfp was associated with germ line nuclei. the expression pattern of fli- <dig> is consistent with expression in the germ line, but expression in the somatic sheath cells cannot be excluded. furthermore, rescue of the fli- <dig> and fli- <dig> glm phenotype could be due to somatic or germline transgene expression. fli- <dig> might be expressed and active in the germ line, in the somatic sheath cells, or both. rnai of fli- <dig> in rrf- <dig> mutants led to the glm phenocopy, suggesting that knock-down of fli- <dig> in the germ line causes the glm phenotype. however, fli- <dig> is very sensitive to gene dosage, so even slight perturbation of fli- <dig> in the soma of rrf- <dig> animals might be enough to cause the phenotype. fli- <dig> males also showed the glm phenotype, and male gonads do not have somatic sheath cells. together, these data suggest that fli- <dig> acts in the germ line, but they do not exclude the possibility that fli- <dig> acts in the sheath cells or in another tissue.

human fliih acts in the nucleus as a component of a coactivator complex and with the tcf/lef and β-catenin complex  <cit> . however, fliih also associates with microtubule- and actin-based structures in the cytoplasm of fibroblasts, and acts with small gtpase and pi <dig> kinase signaling in the cytoplasm  <cit> . it is unclear from these experiments if fli- <dig> acts in the nucleus or cytoplasm in germ line morphogenesis. fli- <dig> could act in the nucleus to regulate expression along with ras signaling. alternatively, fli- <dig> could act in the cytoplasm in a pathway parallel to a transcriptionally-dependent ras pathway, possibly by modulating cytoskeletal architecture involved in germ line reorganization, although no defects in germ line actin organization were apparent. further studies will address these models of molecular mechanisms of fli- <dig> and let- <dig> ras function in germ line morphogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
this work describes the role of the fli- <dig> molecule in germ line morphogenesis in c. elegans. while much is known about meiotic differentiation in c. elegans, less is known about the mechanisms that control meiotic germ cells organization at the periphery of the germ line to form a germ cell-free core of cytoplasm called the rachis. mutations in fli- <dig> perturb rachis organization without perturbing meiotic differentiation. in fli- <dig>  germ cell nuclei occupied positions in the rachis; these misplaced nuclei were partially enclosed by germ line plasma membrane as were nuclei at the cortex; and extension of the gonadal sheath cells were associated with misplaced nuclei deep in the rachis. mutations in let- <dig> ras also displayed this phenotype, and constitutively-active let- <dig> partially compensated for loss of fli- <dig>  indicating that let- <dig> ras and fli- <dig> might act together to control germ line morphogenesis. these studies describe a developmental role for the fli- <dig> molecule in germ line morphogenesis and demonstrate a functional interaction between fli- <dig> and ras gtpases in this process.
