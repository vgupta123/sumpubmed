BACKGROUND
the oncogene v-myb of avian myeloblastosis virus  encodes a transcription factor which is responsible for the ability of amv to transform cells of the myelomonocytic lineage  <cit> . v-myb is derived from the chicken c-myb gene, which plays a crucial role in the development of the hematopoietic system. c-myb is expressed in immature cells of all hematopoietic lineages and is silenced during the terminal differentiation of these cells. it is thought that c-myb is part of a genetic switch that allows hematopoietic progenitor cells to choose between alternative fates, such as proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis  <cit> .

the proteins encoded by v-myb and c-myb  bind to the sequence motif pyaacg  <cit>  and control the expression of a number of genes, such as mim- <dig>  <cit> , the lysozyme gene  <cit> , bcl- <dig>  <cit> , tom- <dig>  <cit> , c-kit  <cit> , gbx <dig>  <cit> , pdcd <dig>  <cit> , the genes for neutrophil elastase  <cit>  and the a2b adenosine receptor  <cit>  among others. recent microarray analyses have suggested that myb actually affects the expression of a much larger set of genes, either by direct binding or by indirect mechanisms  <cit> .

most of the work aimed at understanding how myb activates the expression of its target genes has focused on the promoter regions of these genes and has provided a relatively simple picture of how myb affects gene expression. in many cases, myb binding sites have been identified in the promoter regions of these genes, suggesting that myb acts primarily on the promoters of its targets. recent in-depth analyses of some myb target genes, however, have suggested a more complex picture in which the activation of certain target genes is mediated by cooperation of additional myb-responsive enhancer elements with the target gene promoters. for example, the expression of the chicken mim- <dig> gene is controlled by interactions of myb both with the promoter as well as with a powerful cell-specific enhancer located upstream of the gene  <cit> . similarly, in case of the chicken c/ebpβ gene myb targets the promoter as well as an enhancer located downstream of the gene  <cit> .

recently, another regulatory dna element has been mapped close to a myb-regulated gene. we have shown that chicken gas <dig>  whose promoter region has been known for some time to act as an origin of dna replication  <cit> , is a direct myb target gene  <cit> . other work has shown that the myb homolog of drosophila melanogaster is involved in the control of the replication origin responsible for chorion gene amplification  <cit> . these observations raised the question of whether dna replication origins are also associated with other myb target genes. here, we demonstrate that the promoter region of the myb-regulated chicken adenosine receptor 2b gene acts as an origin of dna replication. furthermore, we identify the chicken mcm <dig> gene as a novel myb target gene and demonstrate that the mcm <dig> promoter is associated with a replication origin. besides identifying two new dna replication origins in chicken cells and a novel myb-regulated gene our work suggests that a significant fraction of myb-regulated genes might be associated with dna replication origins.

RESULTS
the chicken mcm <dig> gene is a myb target gene
the observation that the promoter of the myb-regulated the chicken gas <dig> gene  <cit>  is associated with an origin of dna-replication  <cit>  prompted us to explore the possibility that other myb target regions also co-localize with dna replication origins. ladenburger et al  <cit>  have previously identified a replication origin located between the human mcm <dig> and prkdc genes. both genes are separated from each other by an intergenic region of only  <dig>  kb and are transcribed in opposite directions. this arrangement is conserved among humans, mice and chickens  <cit> . we noted that the corresponding chicken sequence contains a number of potential myb binding motifs . one of the sites  matched exactly to the consensus myb binding motif pyaacg  <cit> , while the other sites had one  or two  mismatches. the human mcm4-prkdc intergenic region also contains  <dig> potential myb binding motifs although their exact positions are not conserved between the human and the chicken sequence. to demonstrate that myb recognizes at least some of the motifs found in the chicken sequence those sites  that showed the best fit to the consensus binding motif were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays  using recombinant v-myb protein expressed in bacteria. as illustrated in fig. 2a, retarded protein-dna complexes were observed when oligonucleotides containing mbs- <dig>  mbs- <dig> and mbs- <dig> were used, demonstrating that v-myb is able to recognize at least three of the potential binding sites in vitro. to confirm the specificity of binding we performed a competition experiment in which binding of v-myb to a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the high affinity myb binding site a from the mim- <dig> promoter  <cit>  was competed by excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing mbs- <dig>  mbs- <dig> and mbs- <dig> . binding was competed efficiently by the mim- <dig> a site itself but not by a control oligonucleotide containing a c/ebp binding site. oligonucleotides containing mbs- <dig> and mbs- <dig> also competed, although less efficiently that the mim- <dig> a oligonucleotide. mbs- <dig> appeared not to compete specifically with the mim- <dig> a site. taken together, this experiment confirmed that v-myb binds specifically to binding sites  <dig> and  <dig> while binding to mbs- <dig> was quite weak.

to investigate whether v-myb is bound to the mcm <dig> promoter region in vivo we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiments using the v-myb transformed myeloblast line bm <dig>  the cells were formaldehyde-fixed and dna-protein complexes obtained after sonication were immunoprecipitated with two different antibodies against myb. as a control, parallel incubations with non-immune serum or with unrelated antibodies were performed. after reverse-crosslinking and purification of the immunoprecipitated dna the samples were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr using the primers that bind to the mcm4-prkdc intergenic region or control primers. the result of the chip experiment is illustrated in fig.  <dig>  we observed substantial enrichment of the mcm4-prkdc intergenic region in samples precipitated with the myb-specific antibodies, whereas control immunoprecipitations with non-immune sera or unrelated antibodies showed no specific enrichment. pcr-reactions with control primers that were specific for sequences located  <dig> kilobasepairs upstream of mcm <dig> did not show significant enrichment in any of the immunoprecipitations. taken together, the chip experiment clearly showed that v-myb was bound to the mcm4-prkdc intergenic region in vivo.

next, we investigated whether v-myb also affected the expression of the mcm <dig> or prkdc genes. to address this issue we made use of a cell line, designated  <dig> , which stably expresses a v-myb/estrogen receptor fusion protein  <cit> . upon β-estradiol treatment of  <dig>  cells the v-myb/er fusion protein is activated and upregulates the expression of a number of myb target genes.  <dig>  cells were cultivated for  <dig> hours in the presence or absence of  <dig> μm β-estradiol. polyadenylated rna from these cells was then isolated and analyzed by northern blotting with probes specific for mcm <dig> or prkdc mrna. as a control, a probe hybridizing to the ribosomal protein s <dig> mrna was used. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the mcm <dig> mrna level was elevated in the estrogen-treated  <dig>  cells when compared to untreated cells, suggesting that chicken mcm <dig> is indeed a myb target gene. by contrast, prkdc was not regulated by v-myb.  <dig>  cells do not express endogenous estrogen receptor  <cit> , suggesting that mcm <dig> is not simply an estrogen-regulated gene.

an origin of dna replication is located upstream of the chicken mcm <dig> gene
to investigate whether the intergenic region between mcm <dig> and prkdc also acts as a dna replication origin in chicken cells we performed nascent strand abundance assays as described by giacca et al.  <cit> . the nascent strand abundance assay is a powerful and widely used method to identify and map dna replication origins. the assay is based on the isolation and quantification of single stranded dna 1– <dig> kb in length  which is primarily derived from replication origin regions. the method can be performed with asynchronously growing cells and does not depend on the availability of antisera against origin binding proteins . briefly, nascent dna 1– <dig> kb in length was isolated from different chicken cells by sucrose gradient sedimentation. sets of primers mapping to the intergenic region as well as to upstream and downstream sequences were used to determine the abundance of the corresponding sequences in nascent dna using quantitative real-time pcr. bm <dig> cells are myeloid v-myb transformed cells that express high levels of the v-myb protein. hd <dig> cells are myeloid cells that do not express v-myb or c-myb. dt <dig> is a line of b-lymphoid cells that express c-myb. finally, we used a subclone of the dt <dig> line in which the c-myb gene had been disrupted by homologous recombination  <cit> . as illustrated in fig.  <dig> the mcm4-prkdc intergenic region was enriched in nascent dna in each of these cell lines. this demonstrated that this region acts as a dna replication origin also in chicken cells. we did not observe significant differences in the abundance of the origin region between myeloid cells expressing  or not expressing  v-myb. although the abundance of the origin region was higher in dt <dig> cells compared to myeloid cells, there was no significant difference between wild-type and c-myb deficient dt <dig> cells. thus, although myb binds to the intergenic region and stimulates mcm <dig> expression, it does not affect the activity of the replication origin.

identification of an origin of dna-replication in the promoter region of the chicken adenosine receptor 2b gene
we also examined the promoters of two known myb-regulated genes, the mim- <dig> and adenosine 2b receptor genes, for replication origin activity. both genes are direct myb targets and their promoters have been analyzed in detail  <cit> . nascent dna from different cell lines was analyzed using sets of primers spanning a region from - <dig> kb to + <dig> kb around the promoter in case of the mim- <dig> gene and from - <dig>  kb to + <dig>  kb around the promoter of the a2b receptor gene. we did not observe enrichment of mim- <dig> promoter sequences in preparations of nascent dna, indicating the mim- <dig> promoter does not coincide with a dna replication origin . by contrast, the promoter region of the a2b receptor gene was enriched in nascent dna, suggesting that an origin of dna-replication is located at the 5' end of the a2b receptor gene . as in the case of the mcm <dig> replication origin we did not observe significant differences in origin activity of the promoter region of the a2b receptor gene between the different cell lines.

discussion
the identification of the chicken gas <dig> gene, whose promoter region functions as a dna replication origin, as a bona fide myb target gene  <cit>  has raised the question whether the co-localization of a myb-regulated promoter with a replication origin is just a rare coincidence or a more common phenomenon? to address this question we used two different strategies: i.) we examined the promoter regions of known myb-regulated genes for replication origin activity using the nascent strand abundance assay. ii.) we investigated the activity of v-myb at the mcm4-prkdc intergenic region, which harbors several potential myb binding sites and is associated with a replication origin in human cells  <cit> .

analysis of the adenosine receptor 2b gene, a known myb target gene  <cit> , showed that the sequences around the 5' end of the gene were enriched in preparations of nascent dna. this observation strongly suggested that the promoter of the a2b receptor co-localizes with a dna replication origin. a further case of such co-localization was revealed by the analysis of the mcm4-prkdc intergenic region. our data showed that v-myb binds to this region both in vitro and in vivo and stimulates transcription of the chicken mcm <dig> gene. furthermore, we demonstrated that the mcm4-prkdc intergenic region is a replication origin also in chicken cells. thus, chicken mcm <dig> is a novel v-myb target gene whose promoter region is also associated with a dna replication origin. as these examples show, myb-regulated genes and replication origins co-localize in some cases. however, it is also evident from the limited number of genes that have been analyzed so far that not every myb target gene promoter is associated with a replication origin. for example, the promoter region of the mim- <dig> gene does not possess replication origin activity.

in the light of the co-localization of replication origins with several promoters containing clusters of myb binding sites we wondered how frequently such clusters occur in the chicken genome. we screened approximately three million basepairs of randomly selected chicken genomic sequences for the presence of clusters of myb binding motifs  that are similar to those found at the mcm <dig>  adora2b and gas <dig> replication origins. while on the average one such motif is present per  <dig> base pairs we found that clusters of at least six of such sites within stretches of  <dig> base pairs occur only once per approximately  <dig> kb. although the number of such binding motif clusters is higher than the estimated number of replication origins in the chicken genome , it appears unlikely that the concurrence of clusters of myb binding motifs and dna replication origins reported here is purely accidental. it will therefore be interesting to examine such clusters of myb binding motifs for their potential role as replication origins.

the functional consequences, if any, of such co-localization are unclear at present. we have not observed that v-myb or c-myb influence the activity of the replication origins identified here. v-myb or c-myb, therefore, appear not to be involved in the control of origin activity. recent work on the myb homolog  of drosophila melanogaster has provided evidence that dm-myb performs a non-transcriptional role in the control of the replication origin responsible for chorion gene amplification  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that some of the phenotypic consequences of mutation of dm-myb can be compensated by b-myb, but not by c-myb or a-myb  <cit> . it is therefore conceivable that b-myb plays a role at the replication origins identified here. another interesting possibility is that rather than being regulated by myb the presence of a replication origin might affect the activation of the associated gene by myb. for example, compacted chromatin structures will be opened during replication thereby providing transcription factors access to the dna. it is therefore possible that the association with a replication origin imposes an additional level of control onto the adjacent gene, which would be expected to be cell cycle dependent. it is presently not known whether the mcm <dig> and adora2b genes are expressed in a cell cycle dependent manner. however, in this respect it is interesting to note that the phenotypic changes of myeloid cells transformed by a temperature-sensitive version of v-myb that accompany activation of v-myb by down-shifting the cells from the non-permissive to the permissive temperature were not observed when dna replication was inhibited  <cit> . this observation is consistent with the idea that the activation of at least some myb-regulated genes depends on dna replication. clearly, further work is necessary until we can discern which of these possibilities, if any, is right.

independent of a possible role of dna replication origins in myb-inducible gene expression our work is also of interest because we have identified two novel replication origins in chicken cells. so far, only very few replication origins are known in chicken cells, such as the origins located in the alpha and beta globin gene clusters  <cit>  and between the lysozyme and gas <dig> genes  <cit> . it is also interesting to note that the origin in the mcm4-prkdc intergenic region has been conserved between between chickens and humans.

another interesting aspect of our work is the identification of the chicken mcm <dig> gene as a myb-regulated gene. mcm <dig>  together with other mcm proteins, forms the hexameric mcm2- <dig> complex which functions as helicase during the s-phase of the cell cycle. the mcm2- <dig> complex is loaded onto the dna prior to the initiation of dna replication and constitutes an essential part of the pre-replication complex . in addition to acting as a helicase in concert with the other mcm proteins forming the mcm2- <dig> complex there is evidence that mcm <dig> also performs a specific regulatory role. mcm <dig> is extensively phosphorylated when cells are exposed to inhibitors of dna synthesis or to uv irradiation, leading to a block of dna fork progression  <cit> , suggesting that mcm <dig> plays a role in the dna replication block checkpoint system. in the normal course of the cell cycle mcm <dig> is phosphorylated by cdk <dig>  leading to the inhibition of the helicase function of the mcm complex  <cit> . blockage of this phosphorylation leads to reinitiation of replication and genomic instability. these observations suggest that mcm <dig> is a key component of the mcm complex whose manipulation can influence the control of dna replication and genomic stability. interestingly, elevated mcm <dig> mrna levels have been found in certain tumors, suggesting that increased mcm <dig> expression can contribute to the malignant properties of the tumor cells  <cit> . recently, a hypomorph allele of mouse mcm <dig> was identified and shown to cause chromosomal instability  <cit> . thus, mcm <dig> is an interesting novel myb target gene that provides a possible link between myb, dna-replication and checkpoint control.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified the chicken mcm <dig> gene as a novel myb-regulated gene and shown that the mcm <dig> promoter region is associated with an origin of dna replication. similarly, our work shows that the promoter of the myb-regulated adenosine receptor 2b gene co-localizes with a replication origin. our work raises the possibility that a fraction of myb target gene promoters is associated with dna replication origins.
