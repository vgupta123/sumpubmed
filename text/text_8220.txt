BACKGROUND
the comparative analysis of gene expression in diseased tissues and its isolated cell fractions can be used to identify genes with potential pathophysiological relevance, including those involved in interactions among different cell types. in the present study 'isolated cell fractions' are defined as cultivated cell populations of individual cell types purified from the respective tissue samples. a direct approach to the gene expression of specific cell types in the tissue is their microdissection from the tissue. isolation and amplification of mrna from microdissected single cells or pure cell type subpopulations has recently been established and described  <cit> . however, this method is just emerging, still having technical problems with reliable cell type markers, exact dissection, and representative mrna extraction and amplification  <cit> . therefore, instead of comparing gene expression profiles of individual cell types between tissue and isolated cell fractions, the present study compared the gene expression profiles of whole tissues and computationally reconstituted expression profiles that combine the expression profiles of the isolated cell fractions according to their relative mrna proportions in the tissue. these relative mrna proportions were determined using trimmed robust regression.

methods for the reconstruction of cell type-specific expression profiles and relative proportions have already been proposed in the literature. the marker gene approach  <cit>  determines the relative mrna proportions from the expression of highly cell type-specific marker genes. a drawback of this method is its dependence on the robust expression of single genes. venet et al.  <cit> , stuart et al.  <cit> , and lähdesmaeki et al.  <cit>  identified cell type-specific expression profiles from tissue samples differing in their cell type composition. venet et al.  <cit>  and lähdesmaeki et al.  <cit>  computed the cell type-specific expression profiles and their corresponding relative proportions simultaneously , whereas stuart et al.  <cit>  determined the cell proportions experimentally and then calculated the respective expression values . the method of lu et al.  <cit>  and the present study are different from the three previous approaches in that they use actually measured, cell type-specific expression profiles and determine the relative mrna proportions computationally . whereas lu et al.  <cit>  compared desynchronized yeast cell 'tissues' and five isolated cell fractions consisting of synchronized yeast cells in the g <dig>  s, g <dig>  m, and m/g <dig> cell cycle phases, the present study compares synovial tissues with the isolated cell fractions of adherent macrophages, adherent fibroblasts. and non-adherent cells. the study of lu et al.  <cit> , however, did not address the relative importance of regulated gene expression resulting from the induction of cell cycle arrest. in contrast, the present study demonstrates for the first time that in order to avoid a bias towards an equal distribution of the computed mrna proportions, as many regulated genes as possible must be excluded from the analysis. here, 'regulated genes' are defined as showing a differential expression between tissue and isolated cell fractions, whereas 'robustly-expressed genes' show a similar expression under both conditions. differential gene expression was also investigated in the study of ghosh  <cit> , in which the gene expression of tumor tissue samples was compared to that of normal tissue controls . this study accounted for the varying relative proportions of stromal tissue within the tumor samples and assumed the gene expression in tumor and normal tissue to be perfectly robust, i.e. independent of their relative proportions in the sample . thus, differential expression in the study of ghosh  <cit>  refers to expression differences between tumor and normal tissue, whereas regulated expression in the present study refers to expression differences between two conditions .

synovial membranes  consist of three main cell types: macrophages and fibroblasts, both adhering to the culture vessel, and mixed non-adherent cells. these cell types are expected to contribute differentially to the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases by expressing pro-inflammatory and pro-destructive genes. therefore, gene expression profiles of the whole synovial tissue and the respective isolated cell fractions of patients with rheumatoid arthritis  and osteoarthritis  were analyzed using affymetrix genechip technology. the performance of the newly developed reconstitution algorithm was validated using two mrna mixing experiments performed by the authors and the mixing part of the genelogic dilution study  <cit> . the computed mrna proportions were compared to the cell proportions determined by immunohistochemistry. regulated and robustly-expressed genes selected according to statistical evidence and pathophysiological relevance are listed in the supplementary material.

RESULTS
the relative mrna proportions of macrophages , fibroblasts , and non-adherent cells  were determined for each tissue sample by matching the measured synovial tissue expression profile s and the computationally reconstituted expression profile s* = pm m + pf f + pn n, which in turn combines the measured expression profiles of the isolated cell fractions of macrophages , fibroblasts , and non-adherent cells  according to their relative mrna proportions .

the matching of s and s* as a function of the relative mrna proportions was performed using trimmed robust regression . trimmed regression only uses part of the data in order to exclude outliers that otherwise would bias the result. here, the result is given by the set of relative mrna proportions that minimize the differences between s and s* as quantified by the regression objective function. solutions to trimmed regression problems are in general not unique due to the data subset choice, however, the solutions generally become more alike with increasing subset size. in the present study, the trimmed regression problem was solved for an increasing number of included genes. for each such number the optimization routine was initialized from several different starting values. the standard deviation of the results obtained from these random initializations was used to assess the similarity of the solutions. the relative mrna proportions were determined from the respective ensemble means at the minimum number of included genes, for which the ensemble standard deviations approached zero, i.e. for which the solution was almost unique. this 'educated guess'  approach accounts for the fact that the solution is completely indeterminate towards zero included genes and increasingly biased towards an equal distribution upon inclusion of all genes . the general performance of this methodology is demonstrated in this first subsection. in order to assess the effect of data preprocessing on the present results the influence of different chip evaluation methods was investigated . the preliminary knowledge of the true relative mrna proportions in mrna mixing experiments was used to validate the present methodology as well as the chip evaluation methods . in addition, the computed mrna proportions were compared to the cell proportions determined by immunohistochemistry and those obtained using the marker gene approach . finally, genes that were regulated and robustly-expressed in all patients were identified using different test statistics .

general performance
the proposed method for the determination of the relative mrna proportions is demonstrated using the data of patient  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows how the means and standard deviations of the computed relative mrna proportions of macrophages , fibroblasts , and non-adherent cells  depend on the number k of genes included in the trimmed regression approach . the mean is variable for small k. settles to a constant value for intermediate k and shows a slow and incomplete convergence towards an equal distribution  for large k. the respective standard deviations approach zero at an intermediate number of included genes. this number was used to determine the mrna proportions from the respective mean values. the solid curves correspond to data, for which an additional local regression normalization was performed for the measured and reconstituted tissue profiles in each algorithmic step . the decrease of the standard deviation is faster for additional local regression normalization in this case, but the resulting mrna proportions are similar.

the general curve progression in figure  <dig> is similar to that obtained from a probabilistic model described in supplementary section a . however, the best estimate of the 'true' tissue mrna proportions assumed by the model was obtained for the smallest number of included genes . this difference can be attributed to the striking roughness and overall flatness of the empirical objective function  used for trimmed regression , if only a small number of genes is included. hence, the means of the computed relative proportions converge to an equal distribution towards both ends. for increasing k, this is due to the inclusion of more and more regulated genes with expression levels non-correlated or negatively correlated between tissue and isolated cell fractions . for decreasing k, this is due to the increasing roughness  and overall flatness of the objective function . the relative mrna proportions of the tissue can be estimated from the respective means of the computed mrna proportions, as soon as the respective standard deviations become sufficiently small. the distribution of the individual mrna proportions can then be assumed to be symmetric, implying the equality of mean and global minimum  <cit> . the drop of the standard deviation was indeed the most important criterion, but the curve progression and the agreement between the curves for the two different chip normalization methods  were also taken into account.

different chip evaluation methods
there is an ongoing discussion about the question which probe set summary and which chip normalization method proves optimal for evaluating oligonucleotide microarrays. for assessing the effect of different chip evaluation methods on the results obtained by robust computational reconstitution, four different probe set summaries were applied: mas-s, mas-c  <cit> , rma  <cit> , and mbei  <cit>  . in addition, four different normalization methods were tested for the mas-s and mas-c summaries: trimmed mean only   <cit> , trimmed mean plus cyclic local regression   <cit> , quantile normalization   <cit> , or centralization   <cit>  . the results are summarized in table  <dig> 

the computed mrna fractions vary considerably among different probe set summaries and, for mas-s and mas-c, among different normalization methods. the methodological scatter differed among patients. it was quantified in terms of the pooled mean absolute deviation  of the relative proportions across methods calculated with regard to the respective mean values, i.e. mad = ∑c∑m|pc−p¯c|/|m||c|

the mas-s summaries were preferred to the mas-c, rma, and mbei summaries in this study because the agreement between the curves with and without stepwise local regression normalization  was generally better for the mas-s summaries . in addition. rma, mbei, and mas-c tended to more extreme proportions close to 100% for patients  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . in view of the relative cell proportions determined by immunohistochemistry , the less extreme values obtained from mas-s are more plausible. moreover, the use of mas-c resulted in irregular curves for patient  <dig> .

the results obtained by excluding weakly-expressed genes  were within the range of the values listed in table  <dig>  this was also true for data filtering by affymetrix present calls and transformation of the data according to the variance stabilization method of huber et al.  <cit>  . masking of outliers as performed by the mas  <dig>  software also did not alter the results. this suggests that measurement errors associated with weakly-expressed genes, outliers, or saturation of certain probe sets play a minor role for the estimation of the relative mrna proportions using trimmed robust regression.

the effect of the experimental chip quality was assessed by correlating the mad of the computed mrna fractions  with several relevant chip operating figures provided by the affymetrix 'expression report' . generally, the mad was positively correlated with the noise and background level of the chips. however, due to the small number of patients the results strongly depended on individual patients , in particular on patient  <dig> .

mixing experiments
in mixing experiments, mrna samples from different sources are mixed together in defined proportions and subsequently hybridized to chips. these experiments were used to validate the present computational approach. two mixing experiments were performed by the authors with material from patient  <dig>  the other experimental data were derived from the mixing part of the genelogic dilution study  <cit> .

the target values for the mrna proportions of the first two mixing experiments were set according to the range of values computed for patient  <dig> . figure  <dig> shows the results for the second mixing experiment using trimmed mean normalized mas-s probe set summaries. the proportions are virtually fixed from the beginning and the standard deviations drop at only a few thousand included genes. this picture was typical for all mixing experiments, probe set summaries, and chip normalization methods of the present study. the number of included genes, at which the computed mrna proportions were determined, was between  <dig> and  <dig> in all cases.

the genelogic dilution study contains  <dig> chips, in which mrna samples from liver and snb <dig> cells were mixed for snb-proportions of  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> .  <dig> . and  <dig>  and subsequently hybridized to hg-u95av <dig> genechips. replicas of these  <dig> mixes were processed by  <dig> different scanners resulting in a total of  <dig> experiments.

immunohistochemistry and marker genes
immunohistochemical staining was used to assess the cellular composition in the synovial tissue samples. the obtained cell type proportions of macrophages , fibroblasts , and non-adherent cells   were compared to the respective mrna proportions  as determined by robust computational reconstitution. for the comparison, each cell type c was assumed to contain a specific amount of mrna rc. the mrna proportions of the model thus read

cell type-specific marker genes allow to determine the mrna proportions from the ratio of the expression in the synovial tissue  and the respective isolated cell fraction  provided the marker gene  is very specific  and robust . in the present study, the relative mrna proportions calculated using robust computational reconstitution and marker genes showed a markedly higher than random consistency only for fibroblasts . obviously, the two premises required by the marker gene approach, specificity and robustness, are not fulfilled simultaneously, at least not for macrophages and non-adherent cells .

regulated and robustly-expressed genes
regulated and robustly-expressed genes were identified using six different test statistics and log-transformed expression values of the measured  and reconstituted  tissues of patients  <dig> to  <dig>  the first four methods are well established techniques in the post-genomic era: significance analysis of microarrays   <cit> , one-sample paired t-test , homoscedastic two-sample t-test  , and veraandsam   <cit> . in addition, two new criteria, μ-test and mad-test, were introduced in the present study owing to the fact that sam, t-test <dig>  and t-test <dig> tended to select robustly-expressed genes with low expression strength . this bias is a result of the fact that the standard error appears in the denominator of these test statistics and that weakly-expressed genes generally show a higher standard error than strongly-expressed genes . as a consequence, the newly-defined μ- and mad-test statistics, tμ = μ <dig> - μ <dig> = mean and tmad = mean, respectively. , do not contain the standard error. the μ-test, and also v&s, appeared to be almost unbiased with respect to expression strength. the mad-test  in the methods section, subsection mathematical model) showed a clear preference for highly-expressed genes when applied to identify robustly-expressed genes . this may reflect the fact that in general small differences in gene expression are observed for highly-expressed genes . also, highly-expressed genes serving fundamental roles in the cell are commonly used as housekeeping genes  <cit> . the p-values of t-test <dig> and t-test <dig> were calculated using both the student distribution and the permutation method described in storey and tibshirani  <cit> . for the paired t-test <dig> np =  <dig> permutations were used. for the unpaired t-test <dig> all np = / <dig> =  <dig> possibilities for obtaining different absolute values of the test statistic were enumerated. the pearson correlation coefficient between the respective p-values was c <dig> =  <dig>  for t-test <dig> and c <dig> =  <dig>  for t-test <dig> suggesting that the gene expression data of the present study are roughly log-normally distributed. consequently, the student distribution derived p-values were used for t-test <dig> and t-test <dig>  the p-values of sam and mad-test were calculated using the permutation method and np =  <dig> permutations, those of μ-test by enumerating all np =  <dig> possibilities. the λ-values of v&s are based on an expression level-dependent error model  <cit> . the pairwise correlations between the six statistical methods are shown in supplementary figure g. <dig> . the best correspondence was observed among sam, t-test <dig>  t-test <dig>  and μ-test . the mad-test differed most from all other methods . also, this test statistic was the only one showing a two-modal p-value distribution in contrast to the uni-modal distributions assumed by the method of storey and tibshirani  <cit>  for calculating false discovery rate -related q-values. the other methods allowed to estimate the proportion of null-hypothesis genes quite consistently . regulated and robustly-expressed genes were identified by  <dig> ) applying each of the six individual test statistics independently and  <dig> ) selecting top-ranking genes with respect to pathophysiological relevance . a total of  <dig> regulated and  <dig> robustly-expressed genes were selected. each method contributed some selected genes and the approach of combining different complementary test statistics for gene selection, as proposed in the present study, may prove useful in future investigations.

discussion
determining and analyzing the gene expression profiles of different tissue cell types under diverse physiological and pathophysiological conditions is a central aim of biomedical research. however, microdissection of single cells or pure cell types, as well as mrna isolation and amplification  <cit>  still bears basic technical problems  <cit> . therefore, gene expression profiles of whole tissue samples and purified cell types were compared in the present study. using robust computational reconstitution, the required mrna proportions and the set of robustly-expressed genes that allow for their determination were simultaneously identified.

the present results suggest that mas-s provided the most stable probe set summaries. this is in contrast to the study of irizarry et al.  <cit> , but is in line with the results of choe et al.  <cit> . this discrepancy may be due to the data sets used. whereas in the study of irizarry et al.  <cit>  only few spiked-in genes were present, choe et al.  <cit>  spiked-in more than  <dig> genes. real world applications like the present study possibly contain more biological and technical noise and the subtraction of the mismatch probes from the perfect-match probes  may be appropriate in this case. recent detailed sequence level studies of binder and preibisch  <cit>  resulted in similar conclusions. however, when shedden et al.  <cit>  applied their fdr-based pairwise comparison method to ovary and colon tumor data, mas  <dig>  performed inferior to most other methods.

chip-wise  averaging of the probes before comparison to other chips  may also be less susceptible to the effects of outliers than the initial comparison of probes between different chips and subsequent averaging of the differences . there were only few differences in the present study among the different chip normalization methods applied to the mas-s and mas-c summaries. however, the application of quantile normalization and also centralization resulted in more outliers compared to the remaining normalization methods. quantile normalization also tended to perform suboptimally without additional local regression normalization in the study of choe et al.  <cit> .

the accuracy of robust computational reconstitution depends on the fraction of robustly-expressed genes, the quality of experimentation, and the appropriateness of the chip evaluation method. the variance is estimated to be in the range of 5–10% in absolute value based on the variability of the computed mrna proportions among methods  and the expected bias introduced by the imperfect robustness of even the most robustly-expressed genes . a sensitivity analysis  showed that the rank order of differentially-expressed genes is only moderately affected by this variance. however, the maximum shift in rank order was always large indicating that some differentially-expressed genes may be lost even from a moderately extended list of top-ranking genes. this maximum rank shift was close to that of random permutations but the third quartile of the rank shift distribution was already much smaller than that observed for random permutations .

the results for patient  <dig> largely differed from all other patients. on the one hand this may be due to the fact that hg-u95a chips were used instead of hg-u95av <dig> chips. on the other hand patient  <dig> is the only type i ra patient   <cit> . this was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and comparison with synovial tissue gene expression profiles of  <dig> other classified ra patients . hence, the differences between ra patient  <dig> and ra patients  <dig> and  <dig> are substantial.

remarkably, the computed mrna proportions considerably differ from the cell proportions determined by immunohistochemistry . most striking is the prevalence of macrophage mrna over fibroblast mrna in contrast to the dominance of fibroblasts over macrophages in the cell composition, implying that macrophages produce  <dig> to  <dig> times as much mrna as do fibroblasts. the results for the mrna proportions may be biased because the isolated fractions of macrophages and non-adherent cells were not perfectly pure with respect to fibroblasts . also, the mrna yield of different cell types may be severalfold different due to experimental methodology, e.g. mrna extraction and amplification  <cit> . furthermore, the cell proportions as determined by immunohistochemistry may be somewhat imprecise due to the limited specificity of this semi-quantitative method. nevertheless, the augmented mrna production of macrophages compared to fibroblasts is expected to be still valid under idealized experimental conditions. the central aim addressed by the present study was the cell type-specific gene expression in synovial tissue and its dependence on cell type composition . cell type-specific gene expression was also addressed by venet et al.  <cit> , who assumed the individual expression profiles to be largely uncorrelated. according to our own-experience , this is an arguable assumption, as also admitted by venet et al.  <cit>  themselves. lähdesmaeki et al.  <cit>  used different constraints in their least squares approach. similar to venet et al.  <cit>  and lu et al.  <cit>  and in contrast to the present study, they included all genes in the sum of squares and showed this to be appropriate in the case of mixing experiments . however, their method, as well as the methods of venet et al. and lu et al. , will give biased results in the presence of regulated  gene expression. using an intermediate number of robustly-expressed genes  avoids, on the one hand, the exclusive dependence on the robust expression of individual highly cell type-specific marker genes and, on the other hand, the bias towards an equal distribution when including all genes in matrix factorization or regression. this statement remains valid despite the inability of all current in silico microdissection methods  to directly assign composition-dependent changes in gene expression to specific cell types.

CONCLUSIONS
the proposed method of robust computational reconstitution is applicable if there is a sufficient number of robustly-expressed genes whose expression is highly correlated between tissue and isolated cell fractions. the existence of such housekeeping genes is plausible and well-known  <cit>  since many genes code for basic cell functions that must be maintained across different environmental conditions. the present approach improves previously published methods for the determination of the relative mrna proportions of different cell types by the exclusion of regulated genes that bias the result towards an equal distribution. in addition, it can identify robustly-expressed genes  and responsive genes that change their expression between tissue and isolated cell fractions . both are of biomedical interest and can be further screened for pathophysiological relevance.

evidently, microdissection of single cells or pure cell types  <cit>  is a promising experimental technique. however, it is still under steady development and, for the time being, the preferential use of macrodissection in combination with in silico microdissection techniques has been recently recommended  <cit> . the method of the present study can thus be readily used as an effective research tool and a supporting reference method for further studies.

note added in proof
during the review process of the present manuscript wang et al.  <cit>  also published a related paper dealing with the cellular composition of complex tissues and the relative contribution of the individual cell types to tissue gene expression.
