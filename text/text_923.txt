BACKGROUND
since the discovery that providing double-stranded rna  to a wide variety of organisms, including insects, can induce rna interference , this method has become a common tool for functional genomic studies, particularly in non-model systems  <cit> . early studies used microinjection to deliver dsrna into insect bodies, but the demonstration that dsrna uptake through ingestion was sufficient to knock target genes down opened the possibility of applying this approach on a larger scale  <cit> . the potential application of rnai for controlling agricultural insect pests soon became evident  <cit> . application of dsrna by crop spraying resembles current insecticide delivery methods, but rna production costs and stability with current technology may restrict its efficacy  <cit> . however, the demonstration that transgenic plants modified to express insect dsrna can successfully control target pests  <cit>  raised the possibility of developing rnai-mediated crop protection  <cit> . transgenic plants expressing dsrna matching specific insect target genes have been demonstrated to control lepidoptera, coleoptera and hemiptera agricultural pests  <cit> , including helicoverpa armigera in cotton  <cit>  and tobacco  <cit> , diabrotica virgifera virgifera in maize  <cit> , nilaparvata lugens in rice  <cit> , myzus persicae in nicotiana benthamiana and arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , and sitobion avenae in wheat  <cit> .

a critical requisite of this technology is the availability of a large number of potential target gene sequences to be screened for effectiveness  <cit> . given that agricultural insect pests are generally non-model systems, little genomic information is available for most of them. originally, cdna libraries were used to screen for insect target genes  <cit> , but the advent of massive rna sequencing by next-generation sequencing platforms has enabled the reconstruction of almost full transcriptomes under any biological condition for non-model organisms  <cit> . this approach to identifying potential gene targets for silencing has been successfully used for various agricultural pests, including the eastern corn borer ostrinia furnacalis  <cit> , the aphid sitobion avenae  <cit> , the beet armyworm spodoptera exigua  <cit> , the brown planthopper n. lugens  <cit> , and the cotton boll weevil anthonomus grandis  <cit> , to name a few.

in addition, a full transcriptome from insects can be used to reveal genes of the core mechanism of rnai, which is mostly conserved among eukaryotes but tends to exhibit peculiarities among taxa. the basic repertoire of genes includes those encoding transmembrane channel proteins  involved in dsrna uptake and systemic spread, nucleases such as dicer and dicer-like that cleave dsrnas into small interfering rnas, and those belonging to the rna-induced silencing complex , including the argonaute protein family, that recognizes dsrna and degrades target mrna, and other factors involved in risc assembly, such as r2d <dig>  and putative rna helicases such as armitage and spindlee  <cit> . a critical factor for efficient rnai in insects is the presence of effective proteins involved in dsrna uptake and systemic spread, as the members of insecta apparently lacks the canonical rna-dependent rna polymerase  activity required for amplification of the sirna signal  <cit> . lepidopteran species, together with other more derived insects such as the dipterans, are believed to be more refractory to systemic rnai  <cit> , and variable sensitivity to systemic rnai has been reported among the lepidoptera  <cit> .

the transcriptional analysis of insects can also shed light on the molecular basis of development. in insects, the control of development, molting and other processes is largely regulated by the balance between the acyclic sesquiterpenoid juvenile hormone , produced at the corpus allatum, and ecdysteroids synthesized at the prothoracic glands  <cit> . synthesis of jhs derives from the mevalonate pathway by the combination of isopentyl pyrophosphate  and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate  to form farnesyl pyrophosphate, which is dephosphorylated to farnesol, oxidized to farnesoic acid, methylated to methyl farnesoate, and converted by epoxidation to jh  <cit> . degradation of jh mainly occurs by the action of juvenile hormone esterase  and/or juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase , both of which lead to a decrease in signaling  <cit> . in the case of ecdysteroids, since arthropods lack the squalene synthase enzyme, synthesis of ecdysteroids depends on an exogenous sterol source derived from the diet, which usually requires dealkylation and a series of hydroxylation steps  <cit> , catalyzed by cytochrome p <dig> enzymes encoded by the halloween genes   <cit> .

tuta absoluta meyrick , known as the south american tomato leafminer or pinworm, is a major solanaceae pest, particularly of tomato . this multivoltine microlepidoptera may attack all stages of the host plant, but female adults lay eggs preferentially in leaves, where emergent larvae penetrate and feed, forming galleries in the leaf mesophyll and leading to severe damage of photosynthetic tissues. major losses also derive from the attack of fruits, aggravated by secondary infection with opportunistic pathogens  <cit> . this neotropical species, once restricted to america, invaded europe and northern africa in 2006/ <dig>  from where it is spreading at an alarming rate, threatening major tomato exporters such as india, china, the united states and mexico  <cit> . furthermore, insecticide resistance has been reported in t. absoluta, making the development of alternative means for control even more urgent  <cit> .

in this study, large-scale rna sequencing  was conducted to establish a transcriptome profile of six developmental stages of t. absoluta, enabling the identification of potential gene targets for knockdown using the rnai approach. in addition, the core genes of the basic rnai mechanism were investigated to determine the suitability of gene silencing in t. absoluta. to validate the coverage of the transcriptome, we searched for genes from insect hormone biosynthetic pathways as potential targets for systemic silencing. furthermore, comparisons of transcript profiles among stages revealed differentially expressed transcripts  at earlier larval instar stages, which allowed identification of potential gene targets. five such genes were evaluated using in vitro transcribed dsrna absorbed by tomato leaflets, fed to 1st instar t. absoluta larvae, resulting in significant reduction of larval body weight while exhibiting knockdown of the genes.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing and assembling
six libraries were generated from t. absoluta samples from eggs, adults, and larvae putatively from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th larval stages. an overall total of ca.  <dig> million reads was obtained, ranging from ca.  <dig> to  <dig> million per library, with an average 44 % gc content . in general, all libraries presented good quality, with an average of  <dig>  % of reads with base call quality at 99 % probability  and 87 % at  <dig>  %  . the sequences were filtered for adaptors and sequencing artifacts, reducing the number of reads per library by  <dig> to 15 % , before transcriptome assembly. the absence of a reference genome for t. absoluta, together with the high coverage in sequenced rna libraries, led us to the use of a de novo transcriptome assembly to generate a reference for subsequent analyses. the high quality reads were in silico normalized to reduce sequencing coverage. the normalized data were assembled with a minimum fragment overlap of 35 bp and only contigs longer than 300 bp were included in the assembly. the assembled t. absoluta transcriptome contained  <dig>  contigs. the assembled reference transcriptome contained  <dig> , <dig> nucleotides in contigs, with an average size of  <dig>  bp, an n <dig> of  <dig>  bp and an n <dig> of 480 bp. the data were deposited under a ncbi bioproject  and under a sequence read archives accession .table  <dig> sequenced libraries for each stage of development with total number of generated bases, total of reads per library, percent g + c, percent of reads with quality above q <dig> or above q30



transcriptome annotation
the assembled t. absoluta transcriptome was analyzed for gene ontology by blastx searches against the ncbi non-redundant protein database  using blast2go  <cit> . from the  <dig>  contigs, ca.  <dig>   presented positive blast hits, with  <dig>   successfully annotated by gene ontology. the predominant positive blast hits identified were from insects, particularly tribolium castaneum, bombyx mori, aedes aegypti, nasonia vitripennis, acyrthosiphon pisum, megachile rotundata, pediculus humanus, and culex quinquefasciatus . in this pair-wise comparison, our dataset showed the highest level of similarity to the tribolium genome, with over  <dig>  hits. given that the lepidoptera b. mori was the second most common top-hit species, with over  <dig>  hits, we consider this effect to be more a consequence of the completeness of the tribolium genome  <cit>  rather than representative of biological genomic conservation.fig.  <dig> most represented species in top blastx-matches and gene ontology classification of the tuta absoluta transcriptome. a. the analysis of the  <dig>  contigs was conducted by blast2go  <cit>  using blastx at an e-value cutoff of e− <dig>  top-hits included insect species with complete genome sequences, including coleopterae , lepitodptera , diptera , hymenoptera , hemiptera , and phthiraptera . b. the analysis of the  <dig>  contigs was conducted by blast2go  <cit> , using blastx to recover annotations with significant homology from the ncbi. all terms ‘biological processes’, ‘molecular function’ and ‘cellular component’ at level  <dig> are represented as percent over total number of sequences, in decreasing order



annotation of the t. absoluta transcriptome by blast2go revealed the main go categories under the ‘biological processes’, ‘molecular function’ and ‘cellular component’ ontologies . the most enriched terms for ‘biological process’ were cellular , metabolic  and single organism processes , while the dominant categories for ‘molecular function’ were binding , catalytic  and transporter activity  . under ‘cellular component’, cell comprised  <dig>  % of the sequences, organelle  <dig>  % and membrane  <dig>  % .

differential expression during development
differential expression between developmental stages of t. absoluta was detected by screening genes with >2-fold variation with statistical significance. in total, the analysis found  <dig>  significant det during development, with  <dig>  det between eggs and larval stages,  <dig>  between larval stages and adults and  <dig>  between eggs and adults. no significant difference in expression was detected between the larval stages. venn diagrams of the det among developmental stages allowed the identification of transcripts exclusive or common to the various stages of t. absoluta . the first venn diagram comprising det between eggs and all analyzed larval stages identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  det between eggs and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th stages, respectively . comparing larval stages with eggs, we identified  <dig> det shared among all four stages analyzed . of the  <dig> det between eggs and 1st stage larvae,  <dig> were exclusive, whereas  <dig> det were shared between 1st and 2nd stage larvae, and the remaining det were shared among the three larval stages. of the  <dig> det between eggs and 2nd stage larvae,  <dig> were exclusive,  <dig> were shared between the 2nd and 3rd stages, and  <dig> were shared between the 2nd and 4th stages. moreover,  <dig> det were exclusive to the 3rd stage in comparison with eggs, while  <dig> were exclusive to the 4th stage .fig.  <dig> venn diagrams representing number of differentially expressed genes among tuta absoluta developmental stages. a. number of genes differentially expressed between the developmental stages egg  and larvae stage  <dig> , stage  <dig> , stage  <dig>  and stage  <dig> , commonly shared or not among stages; and b. number of genes differentially expressed between adults  and larvae stage  <dig> , stage  <dig> , stage  <dig>  and stage  <dig> , commonly shared or not among stages



a venn diagram of det between adults and larval stages showed that there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> det between adults and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th stages, respectively . in this case,  <dig> det were commonly found between adults and all the larval stages . of the  <dig> det between adults and the 1st stage,  <dig> were exclusive,  <dig> were differentially expressed between adults and the 1st and 2nd stage larvae,  <dig> were shared between 1st and 3rd stage larvae; and two were shared between the 1st and 4th stages . of the  <dig> det between adults and 2nd stage larvae,  <dig> were exclusive, and  <dig> were also differentially expressed between adults and 3rd stage larvae. of the  <dig> det between eggs and 3rd larval stage,  <dig> were exclusive . among the  <dig> det between adults and 4th larval stage,  <dig> were exclusive to this stage .

the normalized gene expression values from all the libraries were then used to estimate a euclidian distance matrix based on transcript profiles to generate a dendrogram and a heatmap describing the similarities among the developmental stages of t. absoluta . the heatmap and the dendrogram clearly indicated a similarity gradient between the developmental stages, with the transcript profile from 1st stage larvae more similar to that of 2nd stage larvae, and from the 3rd stage more similar to the 4th. the gene expression profile from eggs was the most distinct from all the other stages, particularly from adults. there was less similarity among larvae and eggs than for larvae and adults. among the larval stages, the closer the stages, the higher the similarity of transcripts profiles .fig.  <dig> heat map and clustering representing most similar transcriptome profiles among tuta absoluta developmental stages. the count matrix for all sequenced samples was used to calculate an euclidian distance matrix, which was used for hierarchical sample clustering, according to the most similar transcriptome profile using the single linkage method, to generate a dendrogram and a heatmap correlating all sample expression profiles into colors, ranging from red  to green . the developmental stages analyzed were egg ; 1st stage larvae ; 2nd stage larvae ; 3rd stage larvae ; 4th stage larvae ; and adults 



annotation of the det between the developmental stages by blast2go revealed that the most enriched terms for the ‘biological process’ ontology were related to metabolic process and single-organism process . when comparing larval stages with the adults, the absolute number of ‘biological process’ terms decreased with development, while the opposite was observed for the larval stages when compared to the egg . a progressive decrease in genes involved with response to stimulus was detected over developing larvae in comparison to adults. in the case of ‘molecular function’, the two most frequent functions among the det were catalytic activity and binding for all stage comparisons, while transporter activity was more prominent in comparisons between the egg and the larval stages . under ‘cellular component’ ontology, cell, organelle, macromolecule complex and membrane were the most frequent compartments found for det genes between eggs and larval stages, but they were less represented , or even absent, when larval stages were compared to adults .

the det were also subjected to a kegg-based metabolic pathway analysis using blast2go. comparing eggs with the four larval stages, there was an increase in the number of biological pathways related to the det, from two pathways in the egg versus 1st stage larvae comparison to up to  <dig> pathways in the egg versus 4th stage . when these larval stages were compared to adults, we observed a relative decrease in number of pathways from the earlier  to the later stages  . in the comparison between eggs and the four larval stages, the steroid hormone biosynthesis and tryptophan metabolism pathways appeared to be altered in the four larvae stages . when we performed a similar analysis by contrasting adults with larval stages, the starch and sucrose metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and galactose metabolism pathways were altered in all larval stages . the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway was the only one altered in all four larvae instars compared to both adults and eggs.

validation of differently expressed transcripts  during development using rt-qpcr
from the  <dig> det between eggs and common to all larval stages , the  <dig> det that were differentially expressed between eggs and the 1st and 2nd larval stages only, and the  <dig> det between adults and common to all larval stages, we chose  <dig> det to validate the rna-seq data:  <dig> among the  <dig> det , five among the  <dig> , and three among the  <dig> det  between adults and common to all larval stages. differences in gene expression between developmental stages were estimated by rt-qpcr using gene-specific primers , with three biological replicates, normalized to three gene references .

of the  <dig> transcripts evaluated,  <dig>  were differently expressed between the distinct libraries, with only one contig  showing no significant difference . figure  <dig> illustrates the relative expression results of four det  by rt-qpcr and rna-seq, while the remaining  <dig> are presented on additional file 6: figure s <dig>  among the  <dig> transcripts differently expressed by rt-pcr, eight  presented a highly similar pattern of transcript accumulation to the one derived from the rna-seq data, with comparable fold-change . for the contigs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the fold-change values were different, but transcript accumulation evaluated by rt-qpcr displayed a similar pattern to the rna-seq analysis . for the remaining eight transcripts, the changes in transcript accumulation detected by rt-qpcr were not related to the pattern observed for the rna-seq data, but there was clear differential expression between stages .fig.  <dig> comparison of relative gene expression based on rt-qpcr or rna-seq among developmental stages. based on the rna-seq data,  <dig> contigs with significant differential expression between developmental stages  were chosen to be validated by rt-qpcr. relative expression of  <dig> genes  based on rt-qpcr is represented by whiskers-box plots with standard deviations, and rna-seq data is represented by fold-differences. whisker-box plots display average values from three biological replicates, and the box contain 50 % of the variation among samples, while the remaining 50 % are divided between the upper quartile  and the lower quartile , represented by error bars . the other  <dig> genes are presented on additional file 6: figure s1



search for genes involved in the rna interference mechanism
the t. absoluta transcriptome dataset was queried for the basic set of genes of the rnai machinery using homologous genes from bombyx mori, drosophila and caenorhabditis elegans. the main functional steps of sirna and microrna processing investigated for homologues included dsrna uptake by sid- <dig> and sid- <dig>  dsrna cleavage into sirna by dicer, risc assembly including putative helicases  and dsrna binding , target degradation by endonuclease activity , and signal amplification by rna-dependent rna polymerase  . in this analysis, we identified homologues for sid-1- <dig> , sid-1- <dig> , and sid-1- <dig> , which together represented  <dig> distinct contigs. we could not find, however, homologous sequences for sid- <dig>  additionally, we searched for orthologues of three c. elegans genes  involved in the germ-line related systemic rnai response  <cit> , but did not identify any in the t. absoluta transcriptome . two homologue sequences were found for dcr- <dig>  three for dcr- <dig>  and one for drosha . the search for dsrna binding factors revealed putative homologues for loquacious  and r2d <dig> , while the search for endonucleases identified homologues for argonaute- <dig> , argonaute- <dig> , argonaute- <dig> , piwi , and aubergine . no contigs displayed significant similarity with a rna-dependent rna polymerase  . a complete list of the genes associated with the basic mechanism of sirna and microrna processing with respective contigs with similarity at an e-value < e− <dig> and per sample fpkm normalized expression values are presented as additional file 7: table s <dig>  including those without significant matches. the original results from the blastx searches are presented as additional file 8: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> the core set of genes of rnai mechanism identified in the tuta absoluta transcriptome. the analysis of the transcriptome identified genes at minimum e-value < e− <dig> related with the process of rnai, including dsrna uptake ; dsrna cleavage into sirna ; dsrna binding ; target degradation by endonuclease activity ; and signal amplification by rna-dependent rna polymerase  with respective number of identified hits at e < e− <dig>  panel adapted from  <cit>

a search was performed to identify genes encoding enzymes of the sesquiterpenoid juvenile hormone  and ecdysteroid biosynthetic pathways . for jh iii biosynthesis, using homologues from b. mori, nine contigs with high similarity  to farnesylpyrophosphate synthase genes  were identified, four to juvenile hormone acid methyltransferase , and four to cytochrome p <dig> family  <dig>  subfamily a, polypeptide  <dig> . for jh iii degradation,  <dig> contigs with similarity to juvenile hormone esterase  and nine to juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase  were identified . all contigs identified, and the respective per sample fpkm normalized expression values are presented as additional file 9: table s <dig>  the original results from the blastx searches are presented as additional file 10: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> juvenile hormone and ecdysteroid hormone biosynthesis with number of hits from the tuta absoluta transcriptome. a. the analysis of the transcriptome identified homologues genes coding for enzymes of the juvenile hormone biosynthetic pathway, including farnesylpyrophosphate synthase ; juvenile hormone acid methyltransferase ; and cytochrome p <dig> ; and for degradation of the juvenile hormone, with juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase ; juvenile hormone esterase  <dig> , with respective number of identified hits at e < e− <dig> by blastx. chemical structures obtained from kegg. b. the analysis of the transcriptome identified homologues genes coding for enzymes of the ecdysteoid hormone biosynthetic pathway, including cholesterol 7-dehydrogenase ; and a series of cytochrome p <dig> enzymes encoded by the halloween genes, such as spook ; phantom ; disembodied ; shadow ; and shade . for ecdysteroid inactivation, a 26-dehydroxylase , with respective number of identified hits at e < e− <dig> by blastx. chemical structures obtained from kegg

gene silencing of novel rnai candidate genes
from the transcriptome of t. absoluta, we selected ten genes that were highly expressed in the first larval stages and verified their homology to important genes from other species based on blastx . the target sequences were then amplified from cdna derived from larval and pupal stages using specific primers containing the recombination sequences attl <dig> and attl <dig>  for later recombination in binary vectors for plant transformation, followed by cloning in pgem-t. five sequences were successfully cloned and tested in rnai assays conducted by providing in vitro transcribed dsrna in solution to detached tomato leaflets. together with the novel candidates, the experiment included three other target genes  that were previously evaluated by our group in t. absoluta , together with a negative control .

a feeding assay was conducted with biological triplicates, with fifty 1st instar larvae feeding on one leaflet. after 5 days feeding on leaflets treated with dsrna, the larvae were weighed and rna was extracted to evaluate the effect of rnai by rt-qpcr . a significant reduction in larvae weight was detected for all of the genes tested compared with the gfp control, indicating a significant growth delay for the larvae . on the other hand, not all genes presented a significant decrease in transcript accumulation . the genes ak and the contigs  <dig> and  <dig> did not show a difference in transcript accumulation compared with the gfp control. ak showed the lowest average larvae weight which was not reflected by a reduction in transcript accumulation, and in this case, a large variation in transcript accumulation was observed.fig.  <dig> rnai effects of  <dig> genes on tuta absoluta 1st instar larvae fed in tomato leaflets. a. relative expression of target genes in larvae, five days after fed on tomato leaflets that absorbed 10 μg of dsrna from each gene target , and a egfp control, plus three genes with previous positive results  all in triplicates. gene expression is expressed in relation to egfp-fed control. b. average weight of larvae  under the same conditions as above. bars represent standard deviation; ‘*” or ‘**”represent significant at p <  <dig>  or p <  <dig> , respectively by t-student test. gene expression used rpl <dig> as gene reference



discussion
one of the main requisites for developing an rnai-mediated pest control strategy is the identification of specific and effective target genes that have a significant impact on insect development or viability, minimizing potential crop losses. many studies have explored rnai as a tool to control insects, and over  <dig> target genes have been evaluated in more than  <dig> species in eight orders . the selection of targets has been based on a candidate gene approach  or a screening approach to discover novel target genes  <cit> . a recurrent problem related with the use of the candidate gene approach is low predictability, with a lack of correspondence of resulting phenotypes, even between close species  <cit> . one way to identify novel target genes is through genomic information. however, agricultural insect pests are mostly non-model organisms, and little or no genomic information is available for most of them. recently thought, the development of rna-seq platforms has enabled the quick assembly of large datasets.

in this study, we were able to build a transcriptome dataset from six developmental stages of t. absoluta based on an overall total of ca.  <dig> million reads, assembled into  <dig>  contigs with an average size of  <dig>  bp. the total number of contigs of the reference assembly was higher than expected based on the total number of genes found in lepidoptera species with full genome sequences available, such as b. mori with  <dig>  genes  <cit>  and plutella xylostella with  <dig>  predicted genes  <cit> . however, de novo transcriptome assembly without a reference genome represents a computational challenge  <cit> , which may result in an imperfect assembly, particularly with short reads  <cit> . using the illumina sequencing platform, comparable results were obtained for the transcriptome of the asian corn borer , from which  <dig>  contigs were generated with a mean size of 198 bp and an n <dig> of 211 bp, and re-aligned into  <dig>  scaffold sequences  <cit> . for another lepidoptera, the beet armyworm , a transcriptome was built from pooled samples of all the developmental stages, with over  <dig> million reads, assembled into  <dig>  contigs with an n <dig> of 542 bp  <cit> . similarly, the transcriptome of the feeding canal of the grain aphid  was assembled into over  <dig>   or  <dig>   contigs, which were re-aligned into more than  <dig>  scaffolds with a mean size of 421–432 bp  <cit> . based on the roche 454-pyrosequencing platform, a cotton ball weevil  transcriptome was generated with over  <dig>  reads, which were assembled into  <dig>  contigs with an average size of 676 bp  <cit> . when directly comparing transcriptome assemblies, the distinct quality parameters adopted in each study must be considered  <cit> . nevertheless, our de novo assembly of the t. absoluta transcriptome was comparable in size with previously published assemblies sequenced using the same sequencing platform. additional quality parameters obtained were the n <dig> and n <dig> values, which were  <dig>  bp and 480 bp, respectively, indicating the formation of large contigs. additionally, go annotation showed that the major biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components were at similar proportions to other transcriptomes  <cit> . thus, we considered the assembled transcriptome to have achieved our main objective: developing a resource for downstream applications, particularly the use of rnai in crop protection.

to characterize the rnai machinery in t. absoluta, we queried the transcriptome for the presence of the core genes involved in rnai  using insect or nematode homologues . although it is a highly conserved cellular mechanism among eukaryotes, some gene homologues responsible for key functions in rnai are absent in certain taxa. also, difference responses to rnai have been reported, particularly among lepidoptera. some of the genes involved in the rnai mechanism, such as ago <dig> and dcr <dig>  have been used as gene targets for silencing, severely impairing ecdysis in the brown planthopper n. lugens  <cit> .

most of the expected members of the rnai core gene set were identified with an e-value < e− <dig>  generally with one to three contigs each, which reinforced the quality of the assembled transcriptome . some contigs may represent a single gene that could not be assembled under the parameters we set. lepidopteran species, together with other more derived insects such as the dipterans, are believed to be more refractory to systemic rnai  <cit> . one proposed reason for the poor rnai response in drosophila is the absence of a canonical 11-helix transmembrane channel protein, named sid- <dig> , originally identified in c. elegans  <cit> . another gene , encoding a gut lumen transmembrane protein associated with dsrna uptake identified in c. elegans, is also absent in drosophila  <cit> . lepidoptera contain three copies of sid- <dig> proteins, which are believed to be involved in dsrna uptake and systemic spread  <cit> , but there are arguments against this view  <cit> . in the t. absoluta transcriptome, four contigs showed homology to the sid-1- <dig> gene of b. mori,  <dig> contigs to sid-1- <dig>  and six to sid-1- <dig>  but no sid- <dig> was identified . thus, t. absoluta has the appropriate genes for dsrna uptake and systemic spread, which is the primary step for effective gene silencing. a proposed alternative mechanism of systemic rnai in drosophila involves receptor-mediated endocytosis dsrna uptake  <cit> , and  <dig> orthologous genes have been identified in n. lugens  <cit> .

similar to drosophila, two dicer paralogues  recognized to differentially process mirna precursors  or long dsrna   <cit>  were identified in the transcriptome of t. absoluta. drosha, which showed a single highly significant matched contig, shares similar functional features with dicer but processes mirna precursors in the nucleus. r2d <dig>  loquacious and pasha contain a dsrna-binding domain , mediate dsrna binding to the risc complex and are considered co-factors of dicer  and drosha   <cit> . we identified  <dig> contigs homologous to r2d <dig> and six to loquacious, but only one to pasha that was below our cut-off value . from the argonaute  protein family associated with small rna identification and binding, and target cleavage, we identified ago- <dig>  ago- <dig>  and ago- <dig>  piwi, and aubergine, all based on homologues from b. mori . ago- <dig> and ago- <dig> are involved in microrna and sirna pathways, respectively, while ago- <dig>  piwi and aubergine are associated with pirna  <cit> . furthermore, we searched for a secondary argonaute family from c. elegans, including ppw- <dig>  ppw- <dig>  sago <dig>  and sago <dig>  in our dataset , but no homologous sequences were found. this result is similar to what was reported for n. lugens  <cit> . we also identified putative helicases, such as the asp spindle and rm <dig>  but not armitage or tudor sn nucleases . as previously described in other insects, no rna-dependent rna polymerase  was detected, even at low significance . according to the homologous genes identified, t. absoluta follows the pattern of other lepidoptera species, with the rnai machinery available for successful rnai, even considering the lack of rdrp. lepidoptera species are recognized to be recalcitrant to systemic rnai  <cit> , and variable sensitivity to systemic rnai has been reported among the lepidoptera, but the causes for this are still undefined  <cit> .

similarly, we were able to identify all the genes encoding enzymes of the sesquiterpenoid juvenile hormone and ecdysteroid biosynthetic pathways as potential targets for rnai silencing . in the jh iii biosynthesis pathway, there were 4– <dig> contigs homologous to each gene from b. mori, while 9– <dig> contigs were identified for the degrading enzymes jhe and jheh . the biosynthesis of ecdysteroid from sterols obtained from the diet depends on the successive action of a dehydrogenase , followed by a series of cytochrome p <dig> enzymes encoded by the halloween genes. all of these genes were identified in our dataset, matching mostly with one or two contigs, except for spook, with  <dig> contig hits . as observed for genes of the rnai machinery, individual detailed analysis of each of these contigs may reveal a single or few copies for each gene, which may derive from the parameters defined in the assembly process. interfering with hormone biosynthesis would be an attractive rnai approach to affect insect development  <cit> , if a systemic effect is feasible in t. absoluta since the two major classes of hormones are synthesized away from the midgut, where ingested dsrna reach.

major losses from t. absoluta infestation derive from galleries formed during larval herbivory  <cit> . therefore, we prioritized genes that were more expressed and potentially more relevant at the first larval stages to develop an rnai approach that would reduce the impact of insect attack. however, it is important to mention that other genes could have an effect on the pest population density. of the overall  <dig>  significantly det,  <dig>  were differentially expressed between eggs and all larval stages and  <dig>  between larval stages and adults. of these det,  <dig> were differentially expressed between eggs and common to all larval stages, and another  <dig> were differentially expressed between eggs and the 1st and 2nd larval stages only. another  <dig> were differentially expressed between adults and common to all larval stages . to validate these differences in expression, we chose  <dig> det:  <dig> among the  <dig> det , five among the  <dig> , and three among the  <dig> det  between adults and common to all larval stages. differences in expression between the developmental stages tested were validated for all genes analyzed, except for one contig . the det between eggs and the 1st and 2nd larval stages  clearly showed greater expression at the first two stages from the rt-qpcr data, corroborating the rna-seq read count , demonstrating that the differences detected among libraries were bona fide. in general, the expression profiles among developmental stages were highly analogous, even for the fold-change values, between the rt-qpcr and rna-seq data for eight contigs . for six contigs , the trend in expression, but not the fold change, was greatly similar. for the remaining eight contigs, there were differences in expression patterns among developmental stages, but there were definite differences in expression between eggs and larvae. thus, the significant differential expression between stages, validated by rt-qpcr, may assist our choice of target genes to focus on those more expressed in the first larval stages.

notably, no significant difference in gene expression was observed among any of the larval stages analyzed. one of the reasons for this may derive from the mode of larval sampling used to obtain rna; they were not staged, which might have led to an overlap between larval instars sampled. we prioritized larval size and age instead of instar to center the rnai effect at the early stages of herbivory. particularly when comparing the number of det between eggs or adults and each larval stage, the numbers differed in each comparison. in this case, it appears that besides the sampling bias, the lack of significant differences in transcripts between larval stages might have derived from a lack of statistical power to detect significance among the differences that occurred. the heatmap and cluster analyses showed a close resemblance in transcript profiles among the larval stages, particularly to the immediate previous or subsequent stage on a similarity gradient, which corroborated the potential lack of discrimination between stages during sampling and/or a biological cause. the gene expression profile from eggs was the most distinct from all the other stages, particularly from adults.

to prove the concept of using transcriptome analysis to discover novel rnai target genes, we performed gene silencing of transcripts that were highly expressed in the first larval stages . we previously developed an rnai delivery assay based on feeding recently emerged larvae with detached tomato leaflets that had absorbed aqueous solution containing in vitro transcribed dsrna of the target genes . using this assay, we successfully demonstrated a significant reduction in larvae weight for all the genes tested in comparison with the gfp control, 5 days after the treatments. three of the five novel genes tested showed a significant decrease in transcript accumulation under the same conditions. however, the decrease in transcript accumulation in t. absoluta was not dramatic, possibly for a number of reasons. one possibility is the criterion we favored for selecting target genes considering that high levels of expression might indicate essentiality. therefore, it could be that these highly expressed transcripts have a high functional threshold, and a mild reduction in expression would compromise gene function.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that the transcriptome dataset generated here represents a valuable genomic resource for screening potential gene targets that affect the development or survival of t. absoluta larvae. we successfully identified all of the genes we expected to find in this species, indicating we had sufficient transcriptome sequencing coverage. from the assembled transcriptome, we detected core components of the t. absoluta rnai machinery, enabling the design of dsrna experiments for gene expression modulation. finally, five novel genes identified as differentially more expressed at the 1st stage in our analysis were demonstrated to be effective potential rnai targets by reducing larval weight and can be considered good candidates for use in rnai-mediated crop protection.
