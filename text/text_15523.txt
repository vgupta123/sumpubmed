BACKGROUND
the germline is the only heritable lineage that ensures continuity of life. a unique feature of the germline is the plasticity of its epigenetic state, which is supported by cycles of programming and reprogramming that lead to acquisition of totipotency in the next generation  <cit> . during embryonic development, primordial germ cells  undergo extensive epigenetic reprogramming prior to the sexual differentiation of male and female germ cells  <cit> . male germ cells go through male-specific epigenetic programming during later stages of germ cell differentiation in adult testes, where they undergo self-renewal, enter meiosis, and differentiate into sperm. this male-specific differentiation accompanies massive cellular reconstruction and chromatin remodeling  <cit> .

a common feature of male germ cells and embryonic stem  cells is the suppression of developmental promoters with bivalent domains of h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig>  in es cells, developmental regulator genes are silent but poised for activation at later developmental stages with bivalent domains  <cit> . in mature sperm, bivalent domains are also found on developmental promoters that are not expressed in early embryos but are activated later during development  <cit> . these developmental genes are silent throughout germ cell development, and bivalent domains on these genes are found in pgcs  and adult germline stem  cells  <cit> , and are maintained into pachytene spermatocytes  and postmeiotic round spermatids   <cit> . based on these findings, it is believed that bivalent domains maintain the development potential of these genes throughout the germline. however, how male germline-specific events are regulated during critical stages of spermatogenesis remains largely unknown.

in addition to epigenetic changes on autosomes, sex chromosomes undergo unique epigenetic programming during the meiotic and postmeiotic stages. in mammalian males, x and y chromosomes are unsynapsed during meiosis in ps, and are specifically silenced by the action of dna damage response  factors such as γh2ax and its binding partner mdc <dig> . this chromosome-wide silencing is called meiotic sex chromosome inactivation . sex chromosome inactivation is maintained into postmeiotic rs in a distinct transcriptionally silent compartment termed postmeiotic sex chromatin  . in spite of postmeiotic silencing in round spermatids, a set of sex chromosome-linked genes, which function in late spermatogenesis, escapes postmeiotic silencing and is activated  <cit> . this escape gene activation is controlled by the ddr factor rnf <dig>  an interacting partner of mdc <dig>  <cit> . currently, the epigenetic landscape associated with epigenetic programming of the sex chromosomes during meiosis remains largely unknown.

in this study, we performed comprehensive epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling during the critical stages of spermatogenesis using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing  and rna-seq, and demonstrate that global epigenetic changes underlie extensive transcriptional alterations during spermatogenesis. our epigenomic analyses further clarify the distinct chromatin environments of autosomes and sex chromosomes during spermatogenesis, and reveals that poised chromatin and formation of bivalent domains underlie genome-wide epigenetic changes during late spermatogenesis.

RESULTS
genome-wide transcriptional change during the mitosis-to-meiosis transition
to assess genome-wide gene expression changes during the mitosis-to-meiosis transition in spermatogenesis, we have recently performed rna-seq analysis at three representative time points before, during, and after meiosis   <cit> . because purified spermatogonia consist of a heterogeneous cell population, it is difficult to obtain a large number of homogenous cells for chip-seq analysis. because of this, we used cultured gs cells  <cit>  as a representative stage of the mitotic phase of spermatogenesis. our cultured gs cells exhibited a gene expression profile similar to thy1+ undifferentiated spermatogonia cells purified from mouse testes , confirming that the gs cells recapitulate undifferentiated spermatogonia in vivo. for meiotic and postmeiotic stages, we used purified ps and rs, respectively . to identify the unique features of germline transcriptomes during spermatogenesis, we compared rna-seq data from these cell types to the published rna-seq data obtained from thy1+ undifferentiated spermatogonia, es cells, somatic cells, and tissues . a heatmap analysis of  <dig>  genes expressed  >3) in at least one condition revealed that a significant transcriptional change occurs during the mitosis-to-meiosis transition, and that the transcriptomes of ps and rs are largely different from that of the mitotic phase of spermatogenesis as well as other somatic cells and tissues . two distinct features that are common in ps and rs transcriptomes are activation of late spermatogenesis genes, as previously described  <cit> , and suppression of a large group of genes that are commonly expressed in the somatic phase and spermatogenesis progenitor cells. herein we will refer to the latter group of genes as somatic/progenitor genes. this analysis suggests that there is a massive transcriptional change at the mitosis-to-meiosis transition during differentiation of mitotic spermatogonia into meiotic spermatocytes, and that transcriptomes during the late stages of spermatogenesis are significantly different from that of somatic lineages  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the global transcriptome changes during the late stages of male germline. a schematic of spermatogenesis. in this study, germline stem  cells were used as the representative stage of the stem cell phase. x chromosomes are depicted in green and the y chromosomes are depicted in orange. barred chromosomes represent suppressed transcription. b a heatmap showing gene expression patterns among several germ cells versus somatic cells. all  <dig>  genes that showed more than  <dig> rpkm in at least one cell type are shown. rna-seq data were obtained from published studies as described in the methods section. c flow chart of grouping of each class of spermatogenesis genes, degree of overlaps, and their expression heatmaps. d gene ontology analysis of each class of spermatogenesis genes. e summary table of each class of spermatogenesis genes. f enrichment of rs active genes on the x chromosome. *p < <dig> e- <dig>  chi-square test. es, embryonic stem cells; gs, germline stem cells; mef, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; ps, pachytene spermatocytes; rpkm, reads per kilobase per million; rs, round spermatids; thy1+, thy1+ undifferentiated spermatogonia



unique features of transcriptomes during meiosis and postmeiosis
to define lists of somatic/progenitor genes and late spermatogenesis genes, the transcriptomes were separated into gene groups according to the following criteria :  four-fold change in pairwise comparisons between gs and ps, gs and rs, or ps and rs;  adjusted p value ≤ <dig>  for significance of differential expression among the cell types; and  rpkm in at least one cell type ≥ <dig>  because sex chromosomes are subject to unique epigenetic programming during meiosis and postmeiosis, we analyzed expression profiles of genes located on autosomes and sex chromosomes separately.

on autosomes, we found that  <dig>  genes were commonly active in ps and rs , and further defined the list of ps- or rs-specific active and inactive genes . gene ontology  enrichment analysis revealed that male reproduction-associated genes are significantly enriched in ps/rs active, ps active genes, and rs active genes . on the other hand,  <dig>  autosomal genes were commonly inactive in ps and rs . go enrichment analysis reveals that the ps/rs inactive gene set is enriched with genes involved in somatic functions such as blood vessel development and tissue morphogenesis, suggesting that they are presumably dispensable during the late stages of spermatogenesis . we also identified  <dig>  constitutively active genes and  <dig>  constitutively inactive genes on autosomes in all three cell types .

because of the paucity of y-linked genes, we focused on the x chromosome for detailed analysis. on the x chromosomes,  <dig> genes were significantly repressed in both ps and rs, consistent with sex chromosome inactivation , and the go analysis demonstrated that this group of genes was highly associated with chromatin modification . on the other hand,  <dig> x-linked genes escaped sex chromosome inactivation and were predominantly expressed in rs. interestingly, this group of genes is specifically expressed in the germline , and is disproportionately enriched on the x chromosome  when compared with those on the autosomes . additionally, we identified  <dig> x-linked constitutively inactive genes in all three cell types . taken together, our rna-seq data are in accord with previous gene expression studies , and these results confirm distinct regulation between autosomes and the x chromosome in spermatogenesis.

distinct epigenetic landscapes between autosomes and the x chromosome during spermatogenesis
to elucidate the epigenetic principles of mouse spermatogenesis, we performed chip-seq chromatin profiling in gs, ps, and rs cells. in particular, we examined the distribution of rna polymerase ii  and representative active epigenetic modifications such as h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h4k8ac, h4k16ac, and histone lysine crotonylation . in addition to active modification, we examined representative silent modifications h3k27me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> 

to account for the distinct regulation of gene expression from autosomes and the x chromosome during spermatogenesis, we first compared the average tag density  profiles of these modifications around transcription start sites  between all autosomal genes and all x chromosome-linked genes during spermatogenesis . based on the limited availability of annotated sequences on the y chromosome, y chromosome data were excluded from our analysis hereafter. consistent with the phenomena of almost complete silencing in msci and postmeiotic rs-specific escape gene activation, rnapii was largely depleted from the x chromosome in ps and slightly increased in rs . although distribution of h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> was comparable between autosomes and x chromosome in gs , h3k4me <dig> was slightly enriched on the x chromosome in ps consistent with the cytological localization that h3k4me <dig> starts to accumulate on the sex chromosomes during the late pachytene stage  <cit> , whereas h3k4me <dig> was enriched on autosomes at this stage . h4k8ac, kcr, and h4k16ac were also enriched on autosomes in ps, and, curiously, h4k16ac was continuously low on the x chromosomes compared to autosomes in all three cell types . in contrast to these active modifications, h3k9me <dig> was slightly enriched on the x chromosome compared to autosomes in gs cells . in ps and rs, consistent with cytological localization  <cit> , h3k27me <dig> was largely depleted from the x chromosome, whereas h3k9me <dig> was enriched there . in contrast, h3k27me <dig> accumulated on autosomes in ps and was highly enriched on autosomal tsss in rs. therefore, these results suggest that autosomes and the x chromosomes are subject to distinct modes of epigenetic regulation during spermatogenesis. because of the distinct regulation, we proceeded to analyze the epigenomes of autosomes and sex chromosomes separately.fig.  <dig> distinct regulation between the x chromosome and autosomes during the late stages of male germline. a gs, b ps, and c rs are shown. average tag density  of each histone mark was compared between all autosomal genes and all x-linked genes. atd, average tag density; gs, germline stem cells; ps, pachytene spermatocytes; rs, round spermatids; chip-seq, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing



autosomal late spermatogenesis genes are silent, but poised in gs cells for later activation in ps
we first focused on the events on the autosomes and investigated whether the genes specifically regulated during spermatogenesis undergo epigenetic changes during differentiation. heatmap analyses revealed that, in gs cells, h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> were highly accumulated on the active genes  . atd analysis revealed that rnapii and h3k4me <dig> were highly accumulated on tsss of these genes, and that h3k4me <dig> localization is broader than localization of rnapii and h3k4me <dig>  and accumulated on the region surrounding tsss of these genes . h4k8ac and kcr were also accumulated around tsss of constitutively active genes, but were less intense on the ps/rs inactive genes that are highly expressed in gs cells , suggesting that, in gs cells, gene activation is distinctly regulated between ps/rs inactive genes and constitutively active genes. consistent with this notion, h4k16ac accumulated on tsss of constitutively active genes, but not on the tsss of ps/rs inactive genes .fig.  <dig> autosomal late spermatogenesis genes are poised in gs cells for activation at ps. a a heatmap showing distribution of histone marks in gs cells. tag density around tss  is shown. b atd of active marks in representative groups in gs cells. c atd of active marks at the genes activated in later stages. d atd of silent marks in representative groups in gs cells. atd, average tag density; gs, germline stem cells; ps, pachytene spermatocytes; tss, transcription start site



notably, rnapii, h3k4me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig> were largely present on ps/rs active genes even though these genes were silent in gs cells . notably, atd of these modifications on ps/rs active genes overlapped with that of ps active genes in gs cells, but rs active genes did not exhibit enrichment of active modifications in gs cells . further, the h3k27me <dig> level of ps/rs active genes was lower than that of constitutively inactive genes, whereas h3k9me <dig> did not show this reduction . these results suggest that the autosomal genes activated in ps are already epigenetically poised by deposition of active modifications and rnapii, as well as by reduction of h3k27me <dig>  for future activation. similar epigenetic gene poising was observed in t cells for genes that are inducible during t cell activation and in other systems  <cit> . taken together, we conclude that activation of autosomal late spermatogenesis genes in ps is preprogrammed in gs cells.

h3k4me <dig> remained on somatic/progenitor genes after gene inactivation in ps
next, we sought to examine how the meiosis-specific transcriptome is regulated for autosomes during the ps stage. at the ps active gene synaptonemal complex protein  <dig> , active modifications such as h3k4me <dig>  h4k8ac, h4k16ac, and kcr were highly accumulated at the tss, and h3k4me <dig> exhibited a broader peak of enrichment near the tss . these profiles of active modifications were common among ps/rs active genes, ps active genes, and constitutively active genes, suggesting that ps-specific gene activation is regulated by a similar epigenetic mechanism with that of constitutively active genes in ps . on the other hand, genes inactivated in ps such as vimentin  exhibited a distinct feature compared to the constitutively inactive genes: h3k4me <dig> largely remained in ps at ps/rs inactive genes and ps inactive genes although rnapii and h3k4me <dig> were largely depleted . in addition, the silent modification h3k27me <dig>  but not h3k9me <dig>  was highly enriched at ps/rs inactive genes . these results suggest that bivalent chromatin signatures such as h3k27me <dig> with h3k4me <dig> are associated with ps/rs inactive genes in ps.fig.  <dig> active marks remain after the inactivation of autosomal somatic/progenitor genes in ps. a distribution of histone marks around ps/rs inactive vim gene locus and ps active sycp <dig> gene locus in ps. b atd of active marks at the active genes in ps. c atd of active marks at the silent genes in ps. d atd of active marks in ps. these genes are activated in rs. e atd of each silent mark in representative groups in ps. atd, average tag density; ps, pachytene spermatocytes; rs, round spermatids



we further investigated whether there is any epigenetic signature that predicts rs-specific gene activation in ps. both h3k4me <dig> and kcr were broadly enriched at rs active genes in ps, but h3k4me <dig> did not show enrichment compared to that of constitutively inactive genes . thus, on rs active genes, h3k4me <dig> and kcr, but not h3k4me <dig>  are already established in ps for future activation in rs.

unique epigenetic landscape of late spermatogenesis genes on autosomes in rs
we next investigated the epigenetic signature of autosomes in postmeiotic rs specifically focusing on the rs active genes. interestingly, active epigenetic modifications were present not just at the promoters of the rs active genes, such as spermatogenesis-associated  <dig> , but were spread out broadly from tsss to transcription end sites  . in the heatmap and atp analysis, h3k4me <dig> was highly enriched in the gene bodies but less enriched at the tsss of rs active genes compared to constitutively active genes . contrastingly, h3k4me <dig>  h4k8ac, and kcr were highly enriched on the tsss of rs active genes even compared to constitutively active genes , while h4k16ac did not show such a difference . these results reveal the unique epigenetic landscape of late spermatogenesis genes on autosomes in rs.fig.  <dig> epigenetic profiles for rs-specific activation and gene poising on autosomal somatic/progenitor genes in rs. a distribution of histone marks on ps/rs inactive vim gene locus and rs active spata <dig> gene locus in rs. b a heatmap showing distribution of histone marks in rs. density around tss  is shown. c atd of active marks at the active genes in rs. for h3k4me <dig>  atd on gene bodies from tss to tes and ±5 kb regions were analyzed. d atd of active marks at the silent genes in rs. e atd of silent marks in representative groups in rs. f expression of each gene set in gs, ps, rs, and es. atd, average tag density; es, embryonic stem cells; gs, germline stem cells; ps, pachytene spermatocytes; rs, round spermatids; tss, transcription start site



autosomal somatic/progenitor genes are silent in rs via the deposition of bivalent epigenetic marks
we next examined the epigenetic signature of somatic/progenitor genes inactivated in rs. h3k4me <dig> remained around the tsss of ps/rs inactive genes such as vim . rnapii and h3k4me2/ <dig> were present on both rs inactive genes and ps/rs inactive genes . importantly, h3k27me <dig> was deposited at the tss of ps/rs inactive genes in rs compared to ps/rs inactive genes in ps, while h3k9me <dig> did not exhibit this feature . this suggests that the deposition of bivalent marks at the tss of somatic/progenitor genes occurred in the transition between ps and rs without expression changes. to determine whether somatic/progenitor genes are poised for activation after fertilization, we compared their gene expression during spermatogenesis and in es cells, which represent the post-fertilization inner cell mass of blastocysts. consistent with our global expression analysis , somatic/progenitor genes  are expressed in es cells, whereas late spermatogenesis genes  are not expressed in es cells . therefore, these results suggest that the somatic/progenitor program is suppressed in late spermatogenesis, but poised for activation after fertilization. importantly, in contrast to the class of bivalent domains on developmental promoters that are consistently silent throughout the male germline  <cit> , our analysis reveals a new class of bivalent genes that are expressed in es and gs cells but are temporarily suppressed in ps and rs. this suggests a novel function of bivalent domains: suppression of the somatic/progenitor program during late spermatogenesis.

x-linked genes subject to msci and postmeiotic silencing are poised for activation after fertilization without the formation of bivalent domains
because sex chromosomes undergo msci and are regulated separately from autosomes in spermatogenesis , we investigated the epigenetic landscape of the x chromosomes separately from that of autosomes. in fig.  <dig>  we classified x-linked genes into two major categories: the major group consists of  <dig> genes that are active in gs but are subject to both msci and postmeiotic silencing ; the other group consists of  <dig> genes that are not expressed in gs, but are highly activated in rs . this latter group is also referred to as escape genes because they escape chromosome-wide postmeiotic silencing in rs and are activated  <cit> .

first, we examined the developmental changes in the epigenetic landscape of representative genes from each group during spermatogenesis. the ps/rs inactive gene timp <dig> was marked with h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> in gs, where it is transcribed . upon entry into meiosis, timp <dig> was silenced by msci, rnapii disappeared from the tss, and the h3k9me <dig> level increased. however, h3k4me <dig> and other active modifications remained on the timp <dig> locus, albeit at a lower level in ps. in agreement with the timp <dig> locus, h3k4me <dig> remained near the tss of ps/rs inactive x-linked genes in ps despite the disappearance of rnapii . these results suggest that msci and postmeiotic silencing are established without complete removal of active modifications.fig.  <dig> epigenetic profile of the x chromosome during the late stages of the male germline. a binding peaks of histone marks on ps/rs inactive timp <dig> gene locus in gs, ps, and rs. b binding peaks of histone marks on rs active akap <dig> gene locus in gs, ps, and rs. atd of histone marks in representative groups in c gs, d ps, and e rs. for h3k4me <dig>  atd on gene bodies from tss to tes and ±5 kb regions were analyzed. f average rpkm of each group in gs, ps, rs, and es. g, h atd profiles of h3k4me <dig> on gene bodies and kcr on tss are compared between wt and rnf <dig> ko. wilcoxon rank sum test was performed for read counts in the highlighted area . atd, average tag density; es, embryonic stem cells; gs, germline stem cells; kcr, lysine crotonylation; ko, knockout; ps, pachytene spermatocytes; rs, round spermatids; rpkm, reads per kilobase per million; tes, transcription end site; tss, transcription start site; wt, wild-type



in rs, h3k4me <dig> and h4k16ac are still present on the timp <dig> locus . paradoxically, the h3k4me <dig> level at ps/rs inactive x-linked genes was higher than that on rs active x-linked genes at the tss, and ps/rs inactive x-linked genes had levels of rnapii and h3k4me <dig> comparable to that of rs active x-linked genes . importantly, this group of genes was highly expressed in es cells . these results suggest that ps/rs inactive x-linked genes are poised for activation after fertilization, as is the case with ps/rs inactive autosomal genes. however, h3k27me <dig> was largely depleted from the x chromosome in ps and rs . therefore, ps/rs inactive x-linked genes are poised in rs without the formation of typical bivalent domains.

distinct epigenetic features underlie rs-specific gene activation on the x chromosome
as described above, we found that ps/rs active autosomal genes are poised in gs cells for activation during meiosis . unlike autosomal genes, x-linked genes that are expressed at later stages possess only a low level of active modifications in gs cells . this result suggests that the x-linked genes are not poised in gs cells for activation during meiosis, which is in accordance with the existence of msci and which supports the notion that autosomes and the x chromosome are distinctly regulated in gs cells prior to entry into meiosis.

next, we examined changes in the epigenetic landscape of rs active x-linked genes during spermatogenesis. on the rs active x-linked gene akap <dig>  which regulates sperm motility, active epigenetic modifications were largely absent in gs cells . upon entry into meiosis, active modifications started to accumulate broadly on the akap <dig> locus with the induction of modest transcription. in rs, h3k4me <dig>  kcr, and rnapii were highly accumulated around the tss, and akap <dig> was robustly expressed. consistent with this, in atd analysis, kcr started to accumulate on the tsss of rs active x-linked genes in ps , and reached a higher level in rs . h3k4me <dig> became enriched on the gene bodies of rs active x-linked genes , and rs active x-linked genes were not expressed in es cells . unlike rs active autosomal genes , rs active x-linked genes did not gain a high level of h4k8ac accumulation . therefore, h4k8ac is specifically associated with rs active autosomal genes.

a unique feature of the rs active x-linked genes is that this group of genes escapes postmeiotic silencing of the sex chromosomes. to determine how this group can escape the chromosome-wide silencing of the sex chromosomes, we investigated the profiles of h3k9me <dig> on the x chromosome. h3k9me <dig> was consistently high in both groups of x-linked genes compared to autosomal genes and did not exhibit a difference between active and inactive genes in rs, whereas h3k27me <dig> levels were low . this result suggests that rs active x-linked gene escape is activated from silent x chromosomes without removing h3k9me <dig> and instead depends on unique profiles of active modifications.

previously, we have shown that rnf <dig> is required for the activation of a subset of escape genes from postmeiotic silencing  <cit> . to elucidate the regulatory mechanism underlying expression of rs active x-linked genes, we examined how unique profiles of active modifications are established on the x chromosome using the testes of rnf <dig> knockout  mice. both h3k4me <dig> and kcr accumulate on gene bodies and tsss of rnf8-dependent escape genes  in an rnf8-dependent manner in ps and rs . these results further support the conclusion that the unique localization of h3k4me <dig> and kcr is important for rs-specific gene activation from the x chromosome.

discussion
the bivalent domains we found on somatic/progenitor genes in this study are distinct from those found in previous studies. because the mission of the germ cells is to maintain the capability to acquire totipotency after fertilization, bivalent domains could help to recover the somatic/progenitor program immediately after fertilization. therefore, bivalent domains are not limited to developmental promoters, but could be a key feature in soma-to-germ transition. at the same time, late spermatogenesis genes are activated in the late stages of the germline but are inactivated after fertilization. kcr and h4k8ac, which are enriched on this group of genes, could ensure temporal activation of late spermatogenesis genes without disturbing the germline potential.

because silencing machinery during meiosis recognizes the sex chromosomes based on their unsynapsed status rather than their gene content  <cit> , it remained unclear whether the sex chromosomes are treated distinctly from autosomes prior to meiosis. our data are in support of differential regulation prior to meiosis. consistent with our findings, a recent study demonstrated that duplicated regions that are enriched on the x chromosome are hypomethylated and enriched with h3k9me <dig> in the germline prior to meiosis  <cit> . it could be intriguing to further investigate the details about inherent differences between the x chromosome and autosomes in the germline.

additionally, our analyses establish the epigenomic features of sex chromosome inactivation in the germline. in spite of gene silencing, active modifications are not completely removed from x-linked genes, and most x-linked genes are poised for activation after fertilization. furthermore, h3k9me <dig>  but not h3k27me <dig>  accumulates ubiquitously on the x chromosomes, and escape from postmeiotic silencing does not involve the removal of h3k9me <dig> but instead depends on the establishment of active marks downstream of rnf <dig>  these modes of silencing and escape gene activation are very different from those in female x chromosome inactivation. in females, x-linked genes are not poised for later activation, and silent marks such as xist rna and h3k27me <dig> are removed only when escape genes are expressed  <cit> . therefore, our analyses clarified a distinct mode of chromosome-wide regulation between males and females.

taken together, our studies revealed the distinct features of both autosomes and the x chromosome in the male germline. these epigenetic differences could be the basis of distinct evolutionary forces between autosomes and sex chromosomes. in spite of postmeiotic silencing, rs active genes are enriched on the x chromosome . this is consistent with rice’s hypothesis and its supporting reports that male-biased genes are enriched on the x chromosome due to hemizygosity in males, despite the silent environment of the x chromosome in rs in mammals  <cit> . however, in other species such as drosophila, male-biased genes are actually enriched on the autosomes and not on the x chromosome . because epigenetic events on the sex chromosomes impact their genetic evolution  <cit> , it would be promising to investigate the links between the epigenetic principles we found in this study and their genomic features and evolutionary traits.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, our rna-seq analyses revealed unique features of male germline-specific transcriptomes, and our chip-seq analyses further revealed the epigenetic regulation underlying these features. the global gene expression change during the mitosis-to-meiosis transition accompanies both the activation of male reproductive genes and the suppression of somatic/progenitor genes, and these somatic/progenitor genes are re-activated after fertilization to recover the somatic/progenitor program. importantly, these gene activation events are preprogrammed with poised chromatin during the late stages of the male germline . first, in gs cells, autosomal ps/rs active genes are poised with h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> at tsss for activation in ps cells. this result suggests that spermatogenic differentiation is preprogrammed in the stem cell phase of spermatogonia. second, in ps, rs-specific genes are modified with h3k4me <dig> and kcr, thereby preparing the rs transcriptome in ps. we further demonstrate that suppression of somatic/progenitor genes during late spermatogenesis is associated with formation of bivalent domains. a large number of somatic/progenitor genes are poised with bivalent domains and, curiously, h3k27me <dig> is gradually established on the tsss of somatic/progenitor genes during the ps to rs transition. our analyses further clarified the differential regulation between autosomes and sex chromosomes.fig.  <dig> summary: programmed gene poising for the male germline transcriptomes. see the discussion section for detail
