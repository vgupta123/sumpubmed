BACKGROUND
analytical expressions for dynamical systems are useful for mapping underlying parameters to observed properties. for many mechanical, electrical, and atomic systems, analysis proceeds by reducing a complicated system to tractable linear system, more often than not involving coupled harmonic oscillators. the effective analytical dynamics then provide valuable intuition even when exact results are eventually obtained using numerical methods.

for dynamics of many biological networks  <cit> , a basic tractable component is a simple switch, with effective dynamics

  x˙=β−αx. 

the symbol x represents the concentration of a molecule, for example a transcript, its encoded protein, or a specific protein modification state; β is a time-dependent production rate, and α is a time-independent decay rate corresponding to a lifetime of α- <dig>  the dynamics of x can be obtained by convolution of the input β with the response function e-αt.

for gene regulatory networks, the input β can often be modeled as an on-off toggle, β =  <dig> in the repressed state and β = β for full activation. this behavior arises naturally from multimeric binding of transcription factors, giving a sigmoidal hill function as a function of transcription factor concentration.

the equilibrium behavior of this model is x =  <dig> for the repressed state and x = β/α for the activated state. transients are also readily calculated. if x is itself a transcription factor, the relevant transient time is the delay between a change in the regulation of x and the subsequent change in regulation of its target genes. this introduces a second concentration, k, representing the concentration of x for half response of its target genes. for a switch from β =  <dig> for t <  <dig> to β = β for t ≥  <dig>  the transient time is α- <dig> ln , which approaches k/ when the threshold k is a fraction of the full response β/α. for a switch from β = β for t <  <dig> to β =  <dig> for t ≥  <dig>  the transient time for decay from β/α to k is α- <dig> ln , dominated by the protein lifetime α- <dig> and more weakly dependent on the ratio of maximum to threshold concentration.

these basic equations can be used to predict the dynamics of bistable systems, such as metabolic switches  <cit> . serial chains can give developmental progressions, such as the bacterial flagella gene network  <cit> . negative feedback between simple switches can lead to bistable response, as observed in delta-notch signaling  <cit>  and used to create a synthetic toggle switch  <cit> .

sustained oscillations can by created by coupling simple switches in a cycle, with each switch negatively regulating its successor, termed a repressilator  <cit> . the repressilator's amplitude and period can be estimated with good accuracy using the dynamics of each switch, giving an amplitude of β/α and a period of roughly 3α- <dig> ln  for the three-component repressilator. although numerical simulations are essential for a full quantitative understanding, the analytical results clearly provide intuition regarding the parameters and parameter ratios that define the oscillator behavior. for example, a stronger promoter will increase β, increasing the amplitude proportionally and increasing the period with much weaker logarithmic dependence. this insight can aid in understanding the differences between observed gene and protein circuits, and knowing which knobs to tweak when designing synthetic circuits. this direct connection also enables design of oscillators with desired period and amplitude, an important prerequisite for standardizing synthetic biology  <cit> .

although built in the laboratory, repressilators do not seem to be common in nature. instead, hysteresis oscillators are thought to provide biological clocks for processes as diverse as neural signaling, basic metabolism, and development  <cit> . the best studied examples may be circadian clocks responsible for synchronizing living systems with day/night cycles, which are thought to have evolved independently in prokaryotes, cyanobacteria, fungi, plants, and animals  <cit> . a reduced model for the animal clock was introduced by barkai and leibler  <cit>  . unfortunately, until now, no simple scaling rules have yet been provided oscillations arising from relaxation or hysteresis from coupled positive and negative feedback loops.

in this oscillator, an activator protein, a, activates transcription of both itself and a repressor, r. the repressor achieves its effect by forming a complex, c, with a, that does not activate transcription. activation of a can generate a reservoir of c that serves as a continuing source of r in the absence of a, which reduces the level of a back to baseline. once the r molecules have degraded, a can reactivate transcription and initiate a new cycle. these dynamics exhibit hysteresis when projected onto the a-r plane.

numerical simulations indicate that hysteresis oscillators have less noisy periods than delay oscillators; in fact, noise can actually serve to prevent the clock from falling into a stable attractor, making it more robust  <cit> . intracellular communication can also improve robustness  <cit> . numerical models have been used to compare clocks using transcriptional versus post-translational repression elements  <cit> . clocks based on the the positive-negative feedback design have been observed computationally to be more easily tuned to desired frequencies  <cit> .

the key parameters of the hysteresis clock model are αa and αr, the decay rates of the activator and repressor proteins; βa and βr, the fully activated production rates; βa, the baseline production rate of the activator, and k is the bimolecular rate constant for a+r→kc. the following scaling rules and approximations are developed:

 <dig>  the maximum concentration of each component is approximately proportional to βa/αa, the ratio of the production rate to the decay rate of the activator.

 <dig>  a second important concentration scale is the reset point βa/k when the activator and repressor concentrations cross, rather than a nominal steady-state baseline concentration of βa/α.

 <dig>  the period is roughly divided into two phases, activation and recovery. the activation phase has duration /βr, equivalent to the time required for repressor to titrate the equilibrium concentration of activator.

 <dig>  the recovery phase has duration αr−1ln⁡, equivalent for the time for repressor to decay from its maximum concentration to the reset point.

this preview of the full results is accurate in the limit that production and decay rates are faster for the activator than the repressor. more accurate  expressions are derived in the methods. the strategy is to separate the oscillator into fast and slow subsystems that depend on the oscillator phase: during activation, a and c are fast and r is slow, and during recovery, c and r are fast and a is slow. this strategy is distinct from treatments that identify the activator as the fast subsystem throughout the entire cycle  <cit> .

the results show that the analytical results are accurate over a wide range of parameter space, compared with the numerical solutions to corresponding odes and also a stochastic simulation at the original literature values  <cit> . more detailed comparisons across parameters are done using odes alone, as the focus of this work is obtaining tractable analytics for a nonlinear system rather than investigating important known differences between odes and stochastic systems for small particle counts  <cit> , or for systems where stochastic dynamics are essential for generating oscillations  <cit> .

the value of the analytical expressions is then demonstrated through a comparison of operating characteristics: the noise, quantified as the variance of the period due to variance in production and decay rates; the cost or inverse efficiency, defined as the rate of protein production averaged over a cycle; and the dynamic range, quantified in decibels as the log-ratio of the concentration of the activating component at its maximum and minimum values. we conclude with a physical interpretation of the clock formulas and use these formulas to interpret results of computational studies.

RESULTS
hysteresis oscillator model
the protein concentrations , , and  of the activator, repressor, and complex are in units of molecules/cell and are denoted a, r, and c when the meaning is clear by context. the terms a and r refer only to free molecules and do not include those contained in complex c. the corresponding mrna concentrations for activator and repressor are am and rm. continuous concentrations are assumed throughout. the mathematical model is

  a˙m=β′a+an/−α′aama˙=β″aam−αaa−karr˙m=β′r+an/−α′rrmr˙=β″rrm−αrr−kar+αacc˙=kar−αac. 

the parameters β′a and β′r are baseline transcriptional rates for am and rm; β′a and β′r are the fully activated transcriptional rates. transcriptional activation is represented by hill functions with half-response at a = ka for the activator and a = kr for the repressor. the same hill exponent n is used for both activator and repressor. this exponent is related to the number of activator proteins that form a transcriptional complex, and cooperative binding can result in hill coefficients larger than  <dig>  although n =  <dig> was used in the original model  <cit> , transcriptional activation in the metazoan clock is thought to be due to dimers  <cit> . if binding is cooperative, n =  <dig> may be more appropriate.

because mrna decay rates β′a and β′r are fast compared to protein decay rates, min- <dig> compared to hr- <dig>  mrna transients are brief compared to protein response. taking the limit of fast mrna response is equivalent to employing steady-state approximations for mrna levels, a˙m ≈  <dig> and r˙m ≈  <dig> .

the steady-state approximation incorporates mrna dynamics implicitly through effective protein synthesis rates,

  βa=β″aβ′a/α′aβa=β″aβ′a/α′a 

  βr=β″rβ′r/α′rβr=β″rβ′r/α′r, 

and effective equations

for notational clarity, subscripted values of t are used to denote times relative to the start of the cycle, and subscripted values of τ refer to time intervals.

central parameter values, presented in table  <dig>  were based on ref.  <cit> . trajectories generated using exactly these values, except with the hill coefficient changed from  <dig> to  <dig> to reflect cooperative binding of transcription factors as dimers, are similar whether from the analytical approximate solutions to eq.  <dig> derived below, the continuous-time ode solution, or the corresponding stochastic dynamics for discrete particle numbers .

a default values are based on ref.  <cit>  but with concentrations rescaled by a factor of  <dig>  corresponding to half activation of a at one molecule per cell. the two values in bold, βr and n, differ from ref.  <cit> .

unlike other studies that focus on the differences between deterministic odes and stochastic simulations, our aim is to develop analytical expressions that reproduce ode behavior. for this purpose, we scaled the concentration parameters so that the concentration ka of a giving half-maximum self-activation occurs at  <dig> molecule per cell, compared with  <dig> molecules per cell from ref.  <cit> . this rescaling gives a bimolecular rate constant k of  <dig> - <dig> hr- <dig> for a pair of molecules, close to a first-principles estimate of the diffusion-limited bimolecular collision rate within the nuclear volume . in addition to the hill coefficient of  <dig> mentioned above, we also set the baseline production rate of repressor, βr, to zero, as opposed to the value of  <dig>  that would be obtained from concentration scaling. results using βr =  <dig> and βr =  <dig>  are virtually identical .

analytical expressions for period and phase
here we provide an overview of the method based on two assumptions:

 <dig>  bimolecular collisions are fast compared to protein synthesis and decay rates.

 <dig>  fast collisions between activator and repressor molecules means that the a + r → c reaction effectively goes to completion, with either a ≈  <dig> or r ≈  <dig> at all times.

the second assumption permits a, r, and c to be calculated from pairwise combinations that eliminate the non-linear bimolecular term. the methods uses an expansion of the hill functions to derive tractable dynamical equations, with summary analytical expressions provided in table  <dig>  the main results are sketched here using a simplified logic approximation, replacing the hill functions with step functions  <cit> . these results are accurate when a passes quickly through its threshold value, which occurs for much of parameter space.

a limiting expressions for the hysteresis oscillator are for αa = αr = α, βa > βr, βa > αka.

b limiting expressions for the delay oscillator are for β1/α > k > β0/α.

the start of the cycle, t =  <dig>  is defined to occur when a and r are both low with a increasing just past r. from the dynamics of a, a˙ ≈ βa - αaa - kar, and the nullcline a˙ =  <dig> crosses a = r at the value βa/k+ <dig>  in the limit of a fast bimolecular reaction, k>αa2/4βa, the crossing point is at a = r = βa/k. the first phase of dynamics  ends when a has risen to its maximum and then returned to a low value, with c high and r still small. the end of this first phase, with duration τ <dig>  is defined when c is at its maximum. in the second phase , c declines to a baseline value and r rises and falls. the end of the second phase, with duration τ <dig>  is defined when r has just crossed below a.

during the activation phase,

  ≈βa+Θ−αa≈βr+Θ, 

where Θ is the unit step function. starting from a = r = βa/k, a rises quickly to ka. the time required is approximately ka/βa . the subsequent dynamics are

  a+c≈βa/αa+exp⁡r+c≈βr, 

neglecting βr relative to βr. since r ≈  <dig> in the activation phase, r + c ≈ c, and  -  > ka is required to maintain activation. assuming that a + c is close to its asymptotic value of βa/αa at this point implies r + c = βa/αa - ka, or

  t = /αa βr + /βa 

for the elapsed time.

there is another brief transient in which a decays to  <dig>  described using the combinations

  ≈−αrr≈0≈c˙≈βa−αa−αrr≈βa−βa≈a˙. 

the second equation uses c ≈ βa/αa during this interval. the time for this transient is approximately ka/.

the total time for the activation phase is therefore

  τ <dig> = /αa βr + /βa + ka/ ≈ /βr 

this value can be rationalized as the amount of time required for enough repressor to be produced, at rate βr, to neutralize the total amount of activator both free and in complex, βa/αa.

at the start of the recovery phase, the complex is at its maximum concentration of approximately  - ka ≈ βa/αa. here a ≈  <dig> and it is convenient to examine the combinations c + a and r – a with

  =βa−αa≈βa−αac≈c˙=−βa+αa−αrr≈r˙. 

for αa ≠ αr, these equations give the dynamics

  c=βa/αa+exp⁡r=⋅, 

which continue until the concentration of r dips below a to trigger a new cycle. the concentrations cross at βa/k, and the duration of the recovery phase is

  τ2=−1ln⁡. 

comparison with the ode solutions
a three-dimensional visualization of the dynamics  demonstrates that the analytical expressions are in excellent agreement with numerical results from odes. for a more complete examination of agreement across parameter space, parameters representing decay rates , activated production rates , and baseline production rates  were scanned over an order of magnitude. the period and the time for the individual phases are compared with numerical ode results using 4d contour plots  <cit> .

decay rates have a strong influence on the period . the activation phase depends almost entirely on αa, with virtually no dependence on αr; the recovery phase depends on the smaller of the two. the parameter space searched is symmetric about αa = αr, with αa/αr ranging from 1/ <dig> to  <dig>  robust oscillations are still observed even when αr >> αa, demonstrating that oscillations do not require that a is the faster subsystem.

the dependence of the full period on the activated production rates scales roughly as βa/βr . most of this dependence arises from the activation phase. for the recovery phase, both the analytical and the numerical estimates suggest very little effect. this result is consistent with a low level of activator during the recovery phase. the baseline production rate of the activator does affect the time for the recovery phase, as well as the activation phase . the production rate of the repressor is generally taken to be low in clock models, and over two orders of magnitude has virtually no effect on the dynamics.

delay oscillator
the first well-known engineered biological clock was a delay oscillator termed the repressilator  <cit> . equations for a standard simplified continuous, symmetric three-component model are presented , again using the approximation that mrna levels decay faster than protein levels. repressilator dynamics, periods, and amplitudes are reviewed in the methods and included in table  <dig> 

in the comparisons that follow for noise , efficiency, and dynamic range, it is necessary to introduce a correspondence between parameters of the delay oscillator and hysteresis oscillator. we assume that production rates, variance in production rates, and decay rates are equivalent in the two systems.

variance of the period
the noise in the oscillator period is analyzed here through the variance, var, providing an analytical route to sensitivity analysis of robustness  <cit> . assuming that production events of a and r are correlated but uncorrelated with decay events, and that both a and r decay at the same rate α, this variance is

  var=2var+2var+cov+2var. 

using the limiting form for the hysteresis oscillator period, table  <dig> 

  var=α−2+α−2var/4βa2+2var/α <dig>  

to simplify this expression, we designated the correlation between βa and βr as r and assume that the coefficient of variation is roughly uniform for each component,

  var/βa2≈var/βr2≈var/βa2≈σ2:     var=+2var/α <dig> 

the corresponding variance for the limiting form of the delay oscillator period is

  var=var/β12+2var/α <dig> 

for purposes of comparison, we assume that var/β12=σ <dig> as well, and that the decay rate α is also the same for the hysteresis and delay designs.

consider separately the variance due to transcriptional noise, scaling as σ <dig>  and variance due to decay noise, scaling as var. the variance due to transcriptional noise will be smaller for the hysteresis oscillator than the delay oscillator when

  r ≥  <dig> – 31/. 

the parameters in table  <dig> suggest βa/βr ≈  <dig>  and noise reduction for the hysteresis oscillator requires a rather large correlation in transcription rates, r ≥ 7/ <dig>  a smaller ratio gives a smaller correlation required for noise reduction. for example, βa/βr =  <dig> gives r ≥ 1/ <dig>  correlation arises naturally because production rates of both the activator and the repressor depend on the concentration of free activator. for the true biological system, correlation would also arise from fluctuations in the concentrations of polymerase and ribosomes.

variation in the period due to decay noise is always larger for the delay oscillator compared to the hysteresis oscillator. assuming a period of  <dig> hours and a protein lifetime of  <dig>  to  <dig> hours, the delay oscillator has 8% to 80% higher variance in its period than the hysteresis oscillator.

efficiency
the efficiency of an oscillator is defined here as the inverse of its power requirements, where power is the rate of protein production averaged over a period. for the hysteresis oscillator, activator and represser molecules are produced at rates βa and βr during the activation phase, and are not produced during the recovery phase, yielding the power requirement τ1/τtot. for the delay oscillator, the synthesis rate during phase  <dig> is β <dig> + 2β <dig>  and the synthesis rate during phase  <dig> is 2β <dig> + β <dig>  with power requirement β <dig> + β <dig> + /τtot.

assuming that baseline synthesis rates are small relative to activated synthesis rates and βr/βa is no greater than  <dig>  suggests these costs:

  hysteresis:βaτ1/τtotdelay:β <dig>  

if the activated production rates are similar, β <dig> ≈ βa, then the hysteresis oscillator will have a cost of τ1/τtot relative to the delay oscillator, giving a cost advantage when τ1/τtot < 2/ <dig>  using typical parameters, the activation phase is faster than the recovery phase, with τ1/τtot ≈ 1/ <dig>  this gives the hysteresis oscillator a two-fold cost reduction, or equivalently a two-fold efficiency increase relative to the delay oscillator.

dynamic range
to be functional, an oscillator must couple to other biological components. the most straightforward coupling is for the activator molecule to serve as a transcription factor for output elements. these elements may have varying binding affinities for the activator, and it may therefore be advantageous for the activator to have a large dynamic range during a cycle. the dynamic range is quantified as decibels  as  <dig> log <dig> 

using the limiting forms from table  <dig>  the dynamic ranges of the oscillators are

  hysteresis:10log⁡10+10log⁡10delay:10log⁡ <dig> 

for the delay oscillator, the ratio of activated to baseline production rates is typically a factor of  <dig> to  <dig>  yielding a  <dig> to  <dig> db dynamic range. the hysteresis oscillator has a similar contribution of  <dig> db from the ratio βa/βa. the hysteresis oscillator has an additional contribution, however, because the minimum concentration of a is much lower than the conventional steady-state baseline βa/α. again using typical values, kβa/eα <dig> ≈  <dig> to  <dig>  and the effect is a boost of about  <dig> db to the dynamic range.

CONCLUSIONS
this work provides a physical interpretation for the period and dynamic range of a model for a hysteresis oscillator. the period has a first phase whose duration, approximately /βr, can be interpreted as the time required to synthesize sufficient repressor molecules at rate βr to titrate an equilibrium concentration of activator molecules, βa/αa. the second phase has duration approximately equal to αr−1ln⁡. this has the familiar form of a protein lifetime, α- <dig>  multiplied by the log-ratio of an initial concentration to a final concentration. the initial concentration, βa/αa, corresponds to the same equilibrium concentration as before. the final concentration, βa/k, is the value when the activator and repressor concentrations cross.

it is intriguing that the critical step triggering the start of a new phase is the crossing of the activator and repressor concentrations. in the context of gene expression, predictors based on crossing of mrna abundances have been remarkably powerful for classification problems  <cit> . the results generated here for a particular nonlinear system show that such crossings can be important in marking the transition between distinct states.

the signal that oscillations are not supported is that the time for the second phase of the cycle, τ <dig>  becomes long. this is apparent in the contour plots showing the time for each phase. for example, in fig.  <dig>  when the decay constants become small, the period becomes rapidly larger. in this region, both a and r are small, and c is close to the value βa/αa. an expansion of the dynamical equations in this region could provide and analytically tractable expression for stability analysis.

our results agree with numerical simulations that have found the hysteresis design to be more robust with respect to noise, but permit the ability to ascribe variance independently to production and decay sources. the hysteresis oscillator period is estimated to be roughly ten times more robust to fluctuations in decay rates. reduction of noise from production rates requires positive correlations of at least 35% between activator and repressor production fluctuations. this observation is interesting because the hysteresis model explicitly couples the synthesis of these components during a single phase of the cycle, whereas the delay oscillator produces components continuously throughout the cycle. same-time production of activator and repressor molecules should naturally introduce correlations in production rates because both depend on the same fluctuating concentration of activator molecules for transcriptional activation.

our results also provide an intuitive explanation for a recent observation that coupled positive-negative feedback oscillators can cover a wider frequency spectrum than pure negative feedback oscillators  <cit> . for the period of the negative feedback oscillator considered here, the protein production rate appears inside a logarithm, giving it only weak influence on the period. for the hysteresis oscillator, however, protein production rates appear to linear order, with a much stronger ability to influence the period. moreover, activator and repressor production rates appear as a ratio, permitting greater leverage for changing the period.

the analytical expressions also permit easy examination of other oscillator properties. sustaining oscillations requires a cost that can be measured in the biomolecules that must be synthesized and then degraded over the course of a period. we estimate that the energetic cost of the hysteresis oscillator is about half that of delay oscillator. our results suggest that efficiency may be an important oscillator property; to our knowledge, it has yet to be studied in computational models.

the output of an oscillator should have a large dynamic range to maximize its ability to couple to output systems. while the dynamic range of a delay oscillator is  <dig> to  <dig> db, the dynamic range of a hysteresis oscillator with similar transcription and decay rates is  <dig> to  <dig> db, an impressive gain. the large dynamic range arises from a state where all concentrations are close to  <dig>  this does not necessarily make stochastic behavior important, however: the relevant count is the number of particles required to activate transcription, ka or kr, rather than the small value βa/k marking the start of a new cycle. as seen in fig.  <dig> with ka =  <dig>  trajectories from odes, analytical approximations, and stochastic simulations are quite similar. when stochastic simulations are run using parameters scaled by a factor of  <dig> to give ka =  <dig>  however, the period is shorter and more variable than continuous odes or the analytical formulas . for the analytical and ode trajectories, the only difference is a 50× scaling in the output amplitudes.

in summary, these results provide a direct connection between parameters and observed properties of a circadian clock model. by showing how period and amplitude scale with parameters, these results help explain results observed in numerical simulations and suggest oscillator efficiency as an area where additional computational analysis may be valuable. the analysis strategy is to convert a nonlinear system into a series of linear systems connected at their boundaries, with a key transition marked by the crossing of activator and repressor concentrations. while the analysis here is for a particular clock model, the analysis strategy is general and should be applicable to other nonlinear biological systems.
