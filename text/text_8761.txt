BACKGROUND
rainbow trout  are the most-widely cultivated cold freshwater fish in the world and are considered by many to be the "aquatic lab-rat". interests in the utilization of rainbow trout as a model species for genome-related research activities focusing on carcinogenesis, toxicology, comparative immunology, disease ecology, physiology, transgenics, evolutionary genetics, and nutrition have been well documented  <cit> . rainbow trout are cultured on every continent except antarctica, with  <dig> global production estimated at  <dig>  metric tons and valued at $ <dig>  billion  <cit> . coupling great interest in this species as a research model with the need for genetic improvement for aquaculture production efficiency and product quality justifies the continued development of genome resources facilitating selective breeding.

the rainbow trout genome is large and complex. genome size estimates derived from determining the molecular weight of dna per cell for rainbow trout and other salmonids vary from  <dig>  to  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp  <cit> . as with most salmonids, rainbow trout experienced a recent genome duplication event resulting in a semi-tetraploid state   <cit> . all ray-finned fishes share an additional  round of ancestral genome duplication in their evolutionary history compared to mammals and birds, but the salmonids' common ancestor underwent an additional recent  whole genome duplication event and more than half of the loci are still duplicated  <cit> . in addition, it is estimated that 50% to 60% of the rainbow trout genome contains interspersed repeat sequences .

current genomic resources available for rainbow trout research include multiple bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries and a bac fingerprinting physical map  <cit> ; a database of ~ <dig>  bac end sequences  ; doubled haploid  clonal lines  <cit> ; multiple genetic maps based on clonal lines and outbred populations  <cit> ; large expressed sequence tag  databases and a reference transcriptome  <cit> ; a micrornas database  <cit>  and high density dna microarrays  <cit> .

two microsatellite-based genetic maps with medium to high marker densities were recently developed for rainbow trout by inra  <cit>  and the ncccwa  <cit> . the inra map is based on a panel of two dh gynogenetic lines. it has more than  <dig> microsatellites over  <dig> linkage groups and a total length of  <dig>  cm . the ncccwa map is based on a panel of five families that represent the starting genetic material of the ncccwa selective breeding program. it has  <dig>  microsatellite loci over  <dig> linkage groups and a total length of  <dig>  cm . the linkage groups from the two microsatellite genetic maps were anchored to the physical chromosomes using fluorescent in-situ hybridization and were found to represent  <dig> chromosome arms  <cit> .

qualitative/quantitative trait loci  mapping experiments in rainbow trout have been very successful because of their high fecundity, external fertilization, and ease of gamete handling and manipulation. many qtl have been identified for production and life-history traits including resistance to the parasite c. shasta  <cit> , resistance to ihnv  <cit>  and to ipnv  <cit> , whirling disease resistance  <cit> , killer cell-like activity  <cit> , upper thermal tolerance  <cit> , embryonic development rate  <cit> , spawning time  <cit> , confinement stress response  <cit> , early maturation  <cit>  and smoltification  <cit> . the availability of a bac physical map integrated with the genetic map will facilitate fine mapping of qtl, the selection of positional candidate genes and the incorporation of marker-assisted selection  into rainbow trout breeding programs. a major shortcoming of qtl studies is that they are limited to the variation present in a limited number of families and typically do not detect loci with small effects. this can be overcome by whole genome association studies and other approaches, such as genomic selection, that capture the effects of most qtl that contribute to the population-wide variation in a trait. recently we demonstrated the feasibility of low resolution ld association studies in rainbow trout  <cit> . in the absence of a reference genome sequence assembly, a robust integrated physical and genetic map will provide better resolution than the current genetic maps for ordering of genetic markers and estimating physical distances between markers, thus facilitating future whole genome association studies in rainbow trout.

the first bac-based physical map of the rainbow trout genome was recently assembled using dna fingerprints of  <dig>  clones from the 10x hindiii swanson library  <cit> . the map contains  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. the physical length of the map contigs was estimated to be approximately  <dig>  gb, which represents approximately 80% of rainbow trout genome. here we report the construction of the first integrated physical and genetic map of the rainbow trout genome using microsatellites isolated from bac end sequences and pcr superpools for library screening and identification of bacs that harbor previously mapped markers. this integrated map provides a frame work for a robust composite genome map and future reference genome sequence assemblies.

RESULTS
bac end sequencing  microsatellites
we screened the bes reads from  <dig> of the largest bac fingerprinting contigs and selected  <dig> microsatellites from  <dig> contigs for pcr optimization and genotyping . of the  <dig> markers genotyped,  <dig> markers appeared to amplify single marker regions and were polymorphic. ten markers were monomorphic, and  <dig> markers could not be resolved and unambiguously scored. fifteen markers generated duplicated patterns, of which  <dig> could be scored for a single marker region and  <dig> produced a scorable duplicated pattern. hence,  <dig> of the duplicated markers produced a monomorphic or an unresolved pattern for one of the two marker regions. two of the  <dig> informative markers could not be assigned to linkage groups . the bes reads from which the  <dig> mapped markers were isolated represent  <dig> unique bac fpc contigs. the  <dig> bes microsatellites are listed in additional file  <dig>  sheet  <dig>  with the corresponding pcr primers and conditions for each marker, number of alleles and size range, genbank accessions, primers sequences and physical map contigs. we have also mapped an additional six bes microsatellites onto linkage groups of the inra genetic map .

library screening with pcr superpools
previously mapped microsatellites
the 10x swanson bac library was screened with the ncccwa pcr super-pools using  <dig> markers that were previously mapped with high confidence to the ncccwa genetic map representing  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes and the inra super-pools were screened with  <dig> markers that were previously mapped onto the inra genetic map representing all linkage groups. the result of the combined effort was that  <dig> markers covering all linkage groups were localized to one or two bac fpc contigs . the list of the markers with positive hits is shown in additional file  <dig>  sheet  <dig>  with the corresponding positive clones and physical map contigs.

a markers previously mapped on the inra genetic map  <cit> .

b markers previously mapped on the usda-ncccwa genetic map  <cit> .

immune response genes
the bac library was also screened with pcr primers from  <dig> immune response genes that were not previously mapped to the rainbow trout genome . positive clones were verified by pcr of the individual clones and direct sequencing from the bac dna. the bac clones that were positive and their corresponding physical map contigs are listed in additional file  <dig>  sheet  <dig> 

single nucleotide polymorphism  markers
the experimental design and results of snps discovery in rainbow trout using a reduced representation library  were recently published  <cit> . of the  <dig> snps that were validated,  <dig> were polymorphic in the ncccwa genetic mapping panel and  <dig> were mapped to chromosomes on the genetic map . the haeiii rrl snp discovery database was aligned with the bes database  to find matches that can be useful for the integration of the genetic and physical maps. we found  <dig> unique matches using ssaha <dig>  <cit> . assuming 48% validation rate for this snps database  <cit>  we expect that approximately  <dig> of the matched snps will be useful for integration between the physical and genetic maps. two of the matching snps were among the  <dig> validated by castaño-sánchez et al.  <cit> . one marker  was among the  <dig> that were mapped. the other snp  was not informative for linkage analysis in the ncccwa panel, but it had two positive hits on end sequences from two bacs that overlap in contig number  <dig> of the physical map .

a loci that were genotyped and were informative for linkage analysis in the ncccwa mapping panel.

b twenty seven loci that were previously mapped to linkage groups in the genetic map version of rexroad et al.  were not linked to other loci in this version, and  <dig> loci that were previously genotyped but not linked were assigned to linkage groups in the current version.

c microsatellites or snps isolated from immune response genes .

d eighty eight duplicated loci were mapped to linkage groups in the current version .

the genetic map
information from  <dig>  genetic loci was used for linkage analysis . two-point linkage analysis placed  <dig>  loci in  <dig> linkage groups at lod ≥ <dig> . an additional  <dig> markers with two-point lod < <dig>  were added to linkage groups manually, of which only six markers had a two-point lod < <dig>  . the specific best of two-point lod score for each marker is provided in additional file  <dig>  worksheet  <dig>  the total combined sex averaged map distance was  <dig> . <dig> cm . a sample map representing chromosome  <dig> is presented in figure  <dig>  and maps representing all chromosomes are presented in additional file  <dig>  multipoint linkage analysis was conducted on individual linkage groups to assign lod scores for the specific position of each marker within the linkage group. the number of markers included in a framework map created at lod ≥ <dig> for the specific position of the marker in the linkage group was  <dig>  the only chromosome that did not contain any framework markers at lod ≥ <dig> was omy <dig>  for which a framework map was created at lod ≥ <dig>  additional loci were added at lod ≥ <dig> , ≥ <dig>  ≥ <dig> , and ≥ <dig>  . additional file  <dig>  worksheet  <dig> contains this information and can be used to recreate maps using mapchart software  <cit> . the average resolution of the genetic map was  <dig>  cm with inter-marker distances ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm for individual chromosomes .

the female:male recombination ratio was  <dig> : <dig>  with the female having a map length of  <dig> . <dig> cm and the male map  <dig> . <dig> cm. this ratio varied by chromosome, ranging from  <dig> : <dig> to  <dig> : <dig> . it is noteworthy that this type of sex recombination ratio estimates do not take into account the larger differences in recombination rate that exist between males and females throughout most of the length of the linkage groups. it is likely that female:male ratios will be elevated throughout most of the length of the chromosome arms, while they will be much lower in the more contracted telomeric ends of the linkage groups because of elevated male recombination rates in these regions  <cit> . it should be pointed out that overall estimates of recombination rate may not be accurately depicted in the current study, because recombination estimates were not obtained by direct comparisons of adjacent intervals. therefore, the reported recombination distances given in this study are likely an underestimate of the real recombination ratio values.

in this version of the map, we have added to the map of rexroad et al.  <cit>  through multipoint linkage analysis  <dig> rrl snps,  <dig> microsatellites from bes and  <dig> microsatellites isolated from bacs that harbor immune response genes . the snps were distributed in all the chromosomes  and the bes microsatellites were mapped to all but chromosome  <dig> . twenty seven loci that were previously mapped to expand the length of linkage groups  <cit>  were not mapped in this version, and  <dig> loci that were previously genotyped but were not linked, were assigned to linkage groups in the current version. a high frequency of duplicated microsatellite loci was observed as previously reported  <cit> , but in many cases only one locus was successfully ordered on the map. overall,  <dig> duplicated markers were successfully mapped to two loci , which means that the total number of markers mapped was  <dig> .

the integrated map
anchoring of  <dig> bac contigs from the physical map to linkage groups was accomplished through mapping of  <dig> loci onto the ncccwa genetic map. the marker loci were derived from the pcr screening of the bac superpools, bes microsatellites , microsatellites isolated from bacs that harbor genes of interest  and one snp marker matched with bes . a schematic illustration of a bac fingerprinting contig anchored to a linkage group is presented in figure  <dig>  markers from  <dig> of the anchored contigs were mapped to two different linkage groups as a result of pfc assembly errors or linkage mapping errors as we have previously discussed  <cit> . the fraction of contigs that are in disagreement between the physical map and genetic map is used to estimate the error rate in the fpc assembly. this error rate of 6%  is similar to the 5% estimated for the catfish physical map of quiniou et al.  <cit>  or the 4% rate detected in the 3-color hicf physical map of the maize genome  <cit> . the number of contigs anchored per chromosome ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> with an average of  <dig> . chromosomes omy <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had the lowest number of  <dig> anchored contigs each, and omy <dig> had the highest number with  <dig> anchored contigs.

the combined physical length of the  <dig> anchored contigs was  <dig>  consensus bands  which is equal to  <dig>  kb based on a conversion ratio of  <dig> cb =  <dig>  kb  <cit> . therefore, we estimate that the integrated map covers ~12% of the physical map, or ~10% of the rainbow trout genome, assuming haploid genome size of  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp. the length of anchored contigs ranged from  <dig> kb to  <dig>  kb with an average length of  <dig>  kb . the ratio of physical to genetic linkage distances varied substantially among the  <dig> anchored contigs that contained spaced markers, which is similar to other vertebrate genomes  <cit> . the  <dig> contigs represent segments from  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes . the kb/cm ratio ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> . in addition,  <dig> contigs were anchored to linkage groups of the inra map through markers that were not informative for linkage analysis in the ncccwa mapping panel , bringing the total number of anchored contigs to  <dig> 

an fpc map with all the genetic markers that we have assigned to bac contigs can be viewed and searched online through: http://www.genome.clemson.edu/activities/projects/rainbowtrout

the integrated map we developed for the rainbow trout genome will facilitate comparative genomics studies with other salmonids and with model fish species. many microsatellite markers can be used for genetic mapping across salmonid species which is very useful for comparative genome mapping  <cit>  and can benefit research in species with less developed genome maps. in addition, the rainbow trout bac end sequences can be used to infer conserved synteny with other fish genomes as we have previously shown , and this integrated map provides a larger frame-work expanding the size of the syntenic blocks that can be identified between fish genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
the first generation integrated map of the rainbow trout genome is composed of  <dig> bac contigs anchored to chromosomes of the genetic map. it covers more than 10% of the genome across segments from all  <dig> chromosomes. this map provides a frame work for a robust composite genome map. the availability of an integrated physical and genetic map will enable detailed comparative genome analyses, fine mapping of qtl, positional cloning, selection of positional candidate genes for economically important traits and the incorporation of mas into rainbow trout breeding programs. a comprehensive integrated map will also provide a minimal tiling path for genome sequencing and a framework for whole genome sequence assembly.
