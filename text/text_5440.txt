BACKGROUND
transposable elements  have been found in virtually all eukaryotic species investigated to date  <cit>  and may represent a significant portion of the genomes of living organisms. tes can account for 80% or more of total genomic dna in plants and comprise 45% and 20% of the genomes of metazoans and fungi, respectively  <cit> . tes are dna sequences with the ability to move from one genomic location to another and can be grouped in two classes according to whether their transposition intermediate is rna  or dna   <cit> .

retrotransposons replicate by a “copy and paste” process, whereby the rna intermediate is reverse-transcribed into double-stranded  dna by enzymes encoded by the tes themselves. elements belonging to class i are further divided into five orders based on their mechanistic features, organization and reverse transcriptase phylogeny: ltr retrotransposons, dirs-like elements, penelope-like elements, lines and sines  <cit> . ltr retrotransposons are the most widespread, especially those from the gypsy and copia superfamilies. members of the ltr order usually encode two open reading frames , one related to viral structural proteins  and the second, known as pol, to a polyprotein composed of an aspartic protease , a reverse transcriptase , an rnase h  and an integrase   <cit> .

although fungal genomes generally contain fewer repetitive sequences than higher eukaryotes, tes are viewed as central agents in the evolution of fungal genomes  <cit> . in magnaporthe oryzae, clusters of tes were associated with increased rates of chromosomal rearrangements, gene duplication and gene evolution  <cit> . there is an apparent correlation between te clustering and chromosomal polymorphism in fusarium oxysporum  <cit> , and in aspergillus niger, recombination mediated by retrotransposons has led to inversions of genomic regions  <cit> . in verticillium dahliae, an asexual plant pathogen, chromosomal rearrangements were found to be associated with retrotransposons, and the authors suggest that homologous recombination between highly similar copies of transposable elements might help to generate genetic diversity  <cit> .

paracoccidioides is a thermally dimorphic fungus that infects approximately  <dig> million people in latin america, causing paracoccidioidomycosis, the most prevalent systemic fungal disease in this region and the deep mycosis responsible for the most deaths in immunocompetent individuals in brazil  <cit> . until  <dig>  the genus paracoccidioides was believed to include only one species: paracoccidioides brasiliensis  <cit> . it was only through multilocus sequence typing  analysis that the genetic variability in this genus, formerly believed to be merely intraspecific and due to geographic polymorphism, was revealed. four cryptic species, s <dig>  ps <dig> and ps <dig>  were identified from the p. brasiliensis complex  <cit> , as well as the new species paracoccidioides lutzii   <cit> .

since  <dig>  it has been accepted that the paracoccidioides genus is composed of four distinct phylogenetic lineages , which vary in their virulence, culture adaptation and the different host immune responses they induce  <cit> . strain pb <dig> is a member of species  <dig> , which is composed of  <dig> isolates among the  <dig> studied and is distributed across latin america  <cit> . the pb <dig> isolate belongs to phylogenetic species  <dig> , which is composed of one venezuelan and five brazilian isolates among the  <dig> studied. the extensively studied clinical isolate pb <dig>  is phylogenetically distinct from the other strains  <cit> .

a comparative genomic analysis of three paracoccidioides species—two p. brasiliensis  and one p. lutzii —identified all types of tes. tes correspond to approximately 8-9% of p. brasiliensis genomes and 16% of the p. lutzii genome  <cit> . we previously described a systematic survey of sequenced paracoccidioides genomes for class ii tes  that resulted in the identification of eight families of dna transposons. a detailed analysis of class ii elements belonging to the tc1/mariner superfamily revealed an unequal distribution among paracoccidioides species and raised the possibility of the presence of active elements in the fungus genome  <cit> . te insertions near genes can modify gene expression patterns, while insertions within genes can interrupt transcription and gene function  <cit> . in this work, we aimed to identify potentially active retrotransposons in the paracoccidioides genome using a paracoccidioides est database to search for retrotransposons with evidence of transcription.

we expanded our search for class i tes  to identify and characterize potentially active retrotransposons in the paracoccidioides species complex. we identified five different retrotransposons  in the genomes of the three isolates. whereas some dna transposons are unequally distributed in the genomes of the paracoccidioides species complex, retrotransposons are present in all of the genomes analyzed.

RESULTS
clustering, similarity and functional annotation of paracoccidioides est sequences
as shown in the workflow in figure  <dig>  the first step in the identification of active retrotransposons in the genomes of the paracoccidioides species complex was to access the information contained in the est database . a local database was built with  <dig>  downloaded paracoccidioides ests, which were then clustered, resulting in  <dig>  sequence clusters distributed in  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singlets. the est clusters were compared with sequences deposited in three databases: nr , tefam and repbase . approximately 20% of the clusters  showed no similarity with any sequences in the nr database with the parameters set ; blast hit descriptions were analyzed based on a lexical search approach using specific keywords resulting in a first set of  <dig> est sequences of putative retrotransposons . further searches against specific databases identified  <dig> est sequences common to the tefam and repbase databases  . a set of  <dig> est sequences that were found to be common between the results from similarity and lexical searches were mapped in the paracoccidioides genomes.figure  <dig> consolidated workflow for the identification of paracoccidioides est sequences harboring retrotransposons. all est sequences  available at dbest  for download from paracoccidioides species were used to build a local database. the clustered approach adopted  resulted in  <dig>  clusters, which were used for further similarity searches against different databases . blast hit descriptions were analyzed based on a lexical search approach  and transposons matching rules suggested by wicker and coworkers  <cit>  for classifying eukaryotic tes were adopted. a set of  <dig> est sequences were found to be common between the results from similarity and lexical searches.



identification and characterization of paracoccidioides retrotransposons
employing the set of  <dig> est clusters as queries against the paracoccidioides genomes, five genomic sequences with characteristics of retrotransposons were identified and are referred to henceforth as rtpc   <dig> to  <dig> . all rtpc elements showed similarity with retrotransposons  . twenty-seven est clusters were anchored to these five genomic sequences, each corresponding to a putative retrotransposon, distributed as follows:  <dig> clusters mapped to rtpc <dig>  three to rtpc <dig> and rtpc <dig>  two to rtpc <dig> and only one to rtpc <dig> . the remaining  <dig> est groups were mapped to genomic sequences with a large number of stop codons, preventing identification of complete copies of retrotransposons.table  <dig>

*as mentioned in the results, element line-tad-like_rtpc <dig> was identical to the non-ltr retrotransposon of the tad-cgt family, which was previously identified as element pbnlr <dig> by novikova et al.  <cit> .



similarity searches were conducted to locate and perform the functional and structural annotation of intact, full copy elements in all supercontigs of p. brasiliensis  and p. lutzii , the three paracoccidioides genomes   <cit> . consensus sequences were generated by alignment of all intact copies of each retrotransposon . we found that there is at least one intact copy of each rtpc element in one or more sequenced paracoccidioides genome. the elements were classified  based on the results of alignments with sequences of retrotransposons from the giri database  using the criteria proposed by wicker et al.  <cit>  and kapitonov et al.  <cit>    <cit> . we identified four rtpc elements belonging to the ltr order from the gypsy  and copia  superfamilies, and one element is a line retrotransposon   that we initially identified as a new type of fungal non-ltr retrotransposon related to the tad clade.figure  <dig> structure and organization of rtpc elements in the paracoccidioides complex. schematic representations of complete rtpc elements are shown. the ltrs are represented by blue arrowheads and pbs/ppt by black bars. the domains are represented as follows: zinc finger – light purple; protease  – green; reverse transcriptase  – yellow; rnase h  – red; integrase  – blue; chromodomain  – orange; and endonuclease  – pink. the orf with its respective size is represented above each element. figures are not to scale.



ltr retrotransposons of the superfamily gypsy 
the gypsy elements identified in paracoccidioides complex were  <dig> to 5740 bp in length, with the coding regions flanked by ltrs. primer binding sites pbs and ppt were also identified at the 5′ and 3′ ends of each element, respectively . the element ltr-gypsy-rtpc <dig>  has two orfs corresponding to the gag gene, which is predicted to encode the proteins of the virus-like particle , and the pol gene, which encodes a polyprotein that gives rise to rnase h-reverse transcriptase, integrase and protease after processing. the pol orf was in a − <dig> frameshift in relation to the gag orf. coding sequences were flanked by 246-bp ltrs, with the nucleotides tg  and ca . the first orf  encodes a 396-amino-acid  protein with a conserved zinc finger domain , and the second encodes a polyprotein that displays the following conserved domains: protease , reverse transcriptase , rnase h , integrase  and a chromodomain . full copies of ltr-gypsy-rtpc <dig>  showed a single orf that encodes a polyprotein with pol domains consisting of protease , reverse transcriptase , rnase h  and integrase . ltr-gypsy-rtpc <dig> and ltr-gypsy-rtpc <dig> shared  <dig> % and  <dig> % nucleotide sequence similarity, respectively, with retroelements identified in the fungus aspergillus nidulans .

ltr retrotransposons from the copia  superfamily
the copia elements identified in the paracoccidioides complex were  <dig> to 5685 bp long with the coding regions flanked by ltrs. the primer binding sites pbs and ppt were also identified at the 5′ and 3′ ends of each element, respectively . comparison with conserved domain databases showed that the element ltr-copia-rtpc <dig> has a single orf that encodes a 1528-aa protein with three conserved domains: integrase , reverse transcriptase  and rnase h . the ltr-copia-rtpc <dig> element had a single orf with fused gag and pol sequences predicted to encode a 606-aa polyprotein with the following domains: gag , integrase , reverse transcriptase  and rnase h . the elements ltr-copia- rtpc <dig> and rtpc <dig> shared  <dig>  and  <dig> % nucleotide sequence similarity with retrotransposons identified in drosophila bipectinata and in the fungus coccidioides posadasii, respectively .

a non-ltr retrotransposon similar to the tad clade elements 
the complete element line-tad-like-rtpc <dig>  contains two separate orfs: the first encodes a protein  with no similarity to any known protein, and the second, with a frameshift in relation to the first one, encodes a protein  that has conserved endonuclease , reverse transcriptase  and rnase h  domains. this element has no ltrs, but a region corresponding to a poly a tail was identified . line-tad-rtpc <dig> shared  <dig> % nucleotide sequence similarity with a retrotransposon identified in the fungus blumeria graminis . to assign this element to a specific clade, an automated tool   <cit>  was employed that uses phylogenetic analysis of the rt domain protein. based on the results from the rtclass <dig> tool, our line element clustered together with the tad <dig> clade, although the rtpc <dig> reverse transcriptase was indicated as belonging to an outgroup clade. in an attempt to find better information on non-ltr retrotransposons related to fungi, we uncovered an interesting report  <cit>  in which the authors employed an in silico approach to survey the non-ltr retrotransposons in  <dig> fungal genomes, reporting more than  <dig> novel non-ltr retrotransposons and, importantly, describing two new clades, inkcap and deceiver. p. brasiliensis isolate pb <dig>  was listed among the species searched by the authors, and three novel tad-like elements, identified as pbnlr <dig>  pbnlr <dig> and pbnlr <dig>  were reported among the novel non-ltr elements harbored by this genome. based on the phylogeny of the rt domains, the authors classified these novel p. brasiliensis non-ltr elements in the tad clade under distinct families: cgt, ask <dig> and ask <dig>  on the basis of sequence identity, it was possible to establish the identity of the line-tad-rtpc <dig> described here with the pbnlr <dig> element cited by  <cit> , which is a tad-cgt element.

distribution of retrotransposons in the paracoccidioides species complex
after identifying at least one complete copy of each of the five elements, the rtpc sequences were used to identify intact and truncated copies in the sequenced paracoccidioides genomes . overall,  <dig> copies of rtpc elements were found scattered throughout the genomes of the three isolates. the majority of rtpc elements  were identified in p. lutzii , and the remaining  <dig> copies were found in p. brasiliensis isolates  . the distribution of copies of each element in the sequence supercontigs is shown in additional file  <dig>  out of  <dig> retroelements identified in the paracoccidioides genomes,  <dig>  were truncated and only  <dig>  were intact . the distribution of truncated forms in paracoccidioides species was as follows:  <dig> copies in p. lutzii  and the remaining copies in p. brasiliensis isolates  . most of the intact elements were found in the pb <dig> p. brasiliensis isolate  and pb <dig> p. lutzii isolate , and four copies were found in the pb <dig> p. brasiliensis isolate . gypsy elements were the most abundant retrotransposons in paracoccidioides genomes, comprising approximately  <dig> %  of the total retroelements identified in these species. out of  <dig> copies of ltr-gypsy-rtpc <dig>   <dig> were found in p. lutzii, followed by  <dig> and  <dig> in isolates pb <dig> and pb <dig>  respectively. four intact copies of rtpc <dig> were present in p. lutzii, and eight were present in pb <dig> . the ltr-gypsy-rtpc <dig> element was the most abundant rtpc element  of all the retrotransposons identified in the paracoccidioides genomes studied here. it is interesting to note that  <dig> % of ltr-gypsy-rtpc <dig> copies  were found in p. lutzii  and that all of these were truncated. only one intact copy of this element was found in the genomes of p. brasiliensis isolates .table  <dig>

copia and line retrotransposons comprised  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all the retroelements in the paracoccidioides genomes, respectively. out of eighteen ltr-copia-rtpc <dig> copies, ten were found in the isolate pb <dig>  followed by five in pb <dig> and three in pb <dig>  as for the ltr-copia-rtpc <dig> element, most copies were found in p. lutzii , followed by p. brasiliensis isolates pb <dig>  and pb <dig> . for the line-tad-rtpc <dig> element, again, most copies  were identified in p. lutzii , followed by isolates pb <dig>  and pb <dig> . most of these elements were truncated in the isolate pb <dig>  .

ltrs not associated with complete retrotransposons
in addition to intact and truncated elements, structural variations of ltr retrotransposons include solo ltrs, which together with ltr remnants are believed to be the result of unequal recombination and illegitimate recombination. we identified  <dig> copies of solo ltrs closely related to gypsy- and copia-rtpc elements; most of these were found in p. lutzii , followed by p. brasiliensis isolates pb <dig>  and pb <dig>  . solo ltrs belonging to the gypsy superfamily are far more abundant  than those of copia-like retrotransposons. the ratio of solo ltr sequences to intact elements was  <dig>  in paracoccidioides genomes, and the ratio of solo-gypsy ltrs to intact elements was also higher than that for solo-copia ltrs vs. intact elements .

the presence of rtpc elements in paracoccidioides isolates of distinct phylogenetic origins
to investigate the occurrence of rtpc elements, a segment of the coding sequence for reverse transcriptase was pcr amplified from the genomic dna of  <dig> isolates, including pb01-like p. lutzii isolates and isolates belonging to the paracoccidioides phylogenetic lineages s <dig>  ps <dig> and ps <dig> from the p. brasiliensis complex . reverse transcriptase was present in  <dig> isolates. the identity of the amplicons was confirmed by sequencing a 300-bp fragment corresponding to the coding region for the reverse transcriptase of each of the five elements  . the element line-tad-rtpc <dig> was present in all isolates. no gypsy element was found in isolates epm <dig> and epm <dig>  no correlation was found between the distribution patterns of rtpc elements and the phylogeny of paracoccidioides lineages.table  <dig>

genomic organization and transcription of rtpc elements
we also analyzed the genomic organization of rtpc elements by southern blot hybridization using probes corresponding to the retrotransposons ltr gypsy-rtpc <dig> and line-tad-rtpc <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the results obtained using genomic dna from p. lutzii  and p. brasiliensis . as expected from the in silico analysis, the ltr-gypsy-rtpc <dig> probe hybridized to multiple genomic fragments from p. lutzii  and p. brasiliensis , confirming the polymorphic nature and abundance of this element. the number and signal intensity of hybridizing fragments identified in pb <dig> was higher than in pb <dig>  confirming the variation in the copy number of ltr-gypsy-rtpc <dig>  the hybridization patterns obtained with the element line-tad-rtpc <dig> indicate that these elements were more abundant in the p. lutzii genome.figure  <dig> genomic southern blot analysis and chromosomal distribution of rtpc <dig> and rtpc <dig> elements. genomic dna from p. lutzii
 and the pb <dig> p. brasiliensis isolate  were digested with restriction enzymes, blotted onto nylon membranes and hybridized with rtpc <dig>  and rtpc <dig>  probes derived from the transcriptase reverse region of each element. the restriction enzymes used were ecori , bamhi , hindiii , bglii, hinfi , hincii , acci  and ecorv . chromosomal distribution of rtpc <dig>  and rtpc <dig>  elements in p. lutzii and p. brasiliensis. the molecular karyotypes of p. lutzii and p. brasiliensis  are shown on the left. chromosomal bands were separated by pfge and stained with etbr. the autoradiograms from southern hybridizations using the rtpc <dig> and rtpc <dig> probes derived from the transcriptase reverse region are shown on the right.



ltr-gypsy-rtpc <dig> and line-tad-rtpc <dig> elements were mapped to the chromosomal bands of isolates pb <dig> and pb <dig> , which had been separated by pfge. pb <dig> and pb <dig> showed distinct karyotype profiles with four and five chromosomal bands, respectively. isolate b <dig> was used as a reference for chromosomal band size. the ltr-gypsy-rtpc <dig> probe hybridized to three and four chromosomal bands in isolates pb <dig> and pb <dig>  respectively . the line-tad-rtpc <dig> probe hybridized to three and two chromosomal bands in isolates pb <dig> and pb <dig>  respectively .

to detect transcripts of rtpc elements, semi-quantitative rt-pcr was performed using cdnas from isolates pb <dig> , pb <dig> and pb <dig> . figure  <dig> shows that the five retrotransposons were transcribed in the yeast form of p. lutzii , but only rtpc <dig>  rtpc <dig>  rtpc <dig> and rtpc <dig> were transcribed in the yeast form of p. brasiliensis .figure  <dig> rtpc transcript analysis. total rna from pb <dig>  pb <dig> and pb <dig> was used to detect mrnas corresponding to the reverse transcriptase region of rtpc elements. reverse transcription data was normalized to β-tubulin.



phylogenetic analysis of rtpc elements
the reverse transcriptase domains from the  <dig> complete elements were employed to establish the phylogenetic relationship between rtpc elements derived from each of the two species of the genus paracoccidioides, p. brasiliensis  and p. lutzii . intact copies of ltr-gypsy-rtpc <dig> and line-tad-rtpc <dig> have been identified in p. brasiliensis and p. lutzii. in the phylogenetic tree , three major clusters can be distinguished. one group contains the ltr-gypsy elements, the second contains ltr-copia elements and the third contains the line elements, all strongly supported by high posterior probabilities, thus confirming the classification of these elements. the phylogenetic tree for the ltr-gypsy-rtpc <dig> element  showed  <dig> clusters, two of which were composed of species-specific sequences from p. brasiliensis  and p. lutzii . the first branch consisted of sequences exclusively from p. brasiliensis , comprising  <dig> of the  <dig> intact copies found in this species ; the central branch was composed of two rtpc sequences from p. brasiliensis  and three from p. lutzii , and a high similarity was observed among the five elements inside this cluster . the grouping of elements from these two different species illustrates the degree of similarity between these elements and suggests a common ancestry. the third branch harbored only one p. lutzii sequence  . this pattern suggests that the rtpc <dig> elements from p. brasiliensis and p. lutzii share sequences that were present in a relatively recent common ancestor, thus supporting the hypothesis of pre-speciation emergence of rtpc <dig> insertions. the rtpc3-copia elements clustered in very close branches and showed a high sequence similarity, which could be explained by the low number of copies analyzed and by the fact that intact copies were only identified in p. brasiliensis lineages pb <dig> and pb <dig>  however, for the line-tad-rtpc <dig> element , it was possible to observe a species-specific grouping, although only a single copy of rtpc <dig> has been analyzed in p. brasiliensis . thus, despite the line-tad-rtpc <dig> elements from p. brasiliensis and p. lutzii being located in separate branches, they nevertheless are phylogenetically close .figure  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of rtpc elements and related fungal retrotransposons. phylogenetic tree of all intact rtpc elements using nucleotide sequences of the reverse transcriptase domain of p. brasiliensis  and p. lutzii  with bayesian inference. trees were rooted with the other subfamilies. ltr elements from aspergillus fumigatus , arthroderma otea , ajellomyces capsulatus blumeria graminis ,ajellomyces capsulatus  and blumeria graminis  were used as outgroups . a shows the phylogenetic tree of all  <dig> rtpc intact elements identified in pb <dig>  pb <dig> and pb <dig>  ltr-gypsy-rtpc <dig> and line-tad-rtpc <dig> trees are shown with more detail in b and c, respectively.



based on the assumption that the two ltrs accumulate point mutations independently, the insertion time of an ltr retrotransposon could be estimated based on variations or sequence differences between the two ltrs ends, where would have been identical at the time of insertion  <cit> . very low nucleotide divergence was observed in the ltrs of the  <dig> intact rtpc elements . considering that the analyzed elements are intact and most likely active, the estimated divergence between ltrs suggested recent insertion events in the genomes of p. brasiliensis and p. lutzii.

discussion
our group previously described a systematic survey of class ii tes  in the sequenced paracoccidioides genomes that identified eight families of dna transposons  <cit> . here, we expand our search for class i tes  to identify and characterize potentially active retrotransposons in the paracoccidioides species complex. to achieve this goal, a combined computational and experimental approach was applied to map these elements in the sequenced paracoccidioides genomes . we identified five different retrotransposon families  in the genomes of the three isolates. although some dna transposons are unequally distributed in the three paracoccidioides genomes, with some lineage-specific elements, retrotransposons are spread over all of the genomes analyzed. however, our data reveal several interesting characteristics of retrotransposon organization in paracoccidioides species. for instance, p. brasiliensis and p. lutzii species harbor the same retrotransposon lineages but differ from one another in the number of copies present. p. lutzii contains  <dig>  to  <dig>  times more retrotransposons than p. brasiliensis isolates pb <dig> and pb <dig>  respectively. differences in ltr content were also observed between closely related species, such as those in the coccidioides genus  <cit> . another remarkable characteristic was the high number of truncated elements. for example, all gypsy-rtpc <dig> and copia-like insertions were degenerated in p. lutzii. despite the differences in number and integrity between the five retrotransposon families, they were most likely acquired before the speciation event that gave rise to p. brasiliensis and p. lutzii, in contrast to some dna transposons that appear to have been acquired after this event  <cit> .

desjardins et al.  <cit>  performed a comparative genomic analysis and reported a high number of tes in paracoccidioides genomes. mobile elements account for 16% of the p. lutzii genome and  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the genomes of p. brasiliensis isolates pb <dig> and pb <dig>  respectively. a total of  <dig> retrotransposons were identified in the p. lutzii genome, a two-fold expansion compared with the p. brasiliensis genomes . in our work, we identified a smaller number of retrotransposons than previously described  <cit> , with a total of  <dig> in pb <dig>   <dig> in pb <dig> and  <dig> in pb <dig>  this outcome may be explained by the fact that we searched for potentially active elements in an est database, and given that highly defective elements are not represented in est databases, they may not have been identified with this strategy.

ltr retrotransposons are classified into five superfamilies, of which copia and gypsy are found in fungal genomes, with gypsy being the most abundant  <cit> . as expected for this type of genome, p. lutzii contains more gypsy than copia elements, and in isolate pb <dig>  there were nine times more of the former than of the latter. in isolate pb <dig>  however, we identified  <dig> copia and  <dig> gypsy elements. in the global analysis of transposable elements performed by desjardins et al.  <cit> , slightly more gypsy elements  than copia elements  were found. in the three genomes they studied, there were more ltr retrotransposons than line-like elements.

active transposable elements can be highly mutagenic, inserting into coding regions and leading to chromosomal breaks and rearrangements. genomes tend to resist the expansion of tes, and many organisms have developed genome defense systems that repress the activity of mobile elements  <cit> . several mechanisms could be responsible for retrotransposon removal in paracoccidioides genomes. one such mechanism could involve the erosion of ltr retrotransposons through the accumulation of point mutations or minor deletions. this accumulation could be due to repeat-induced point mutations , as described in neurospora  <cit> , in which retrotransposons were inactivated by the accumulation of point mutations generated by an increased number of stop codons resulting from g-c to a-t transitions  <cit> . the presence of multiple stop codons was observed in the majority of retrotransposons identified in paracoccidioides genomes in our study; in fact, only 5% of the identified elements corresponded to intact copies. analysis of gc content indicated an especially high at content in ltr-gypsy-rtpc <dig> and ltr-copia-rtpc <dig> retrotransposons, which have the highest proportion of truncated elements. desjardins et al.  <cit>  also reported a lower cg content  in transposon sequences than in the rest of the paracoccidioides genome. the generation of solo-ltrs as a by-product of recombination between flanking ltrs of the same element could also be responsible for the deterioration of these elements. this seems to be the main mechanism driving the deterioration of ty3/gypsy elements in anopheles gambiae  <cit> . a large number of solo ltrs were found in all of the genomes analyzed in our study, indicating that a similar mechanism may have occurred in paracoccidioides and could have played a role in the generation of the genomic plasticity observed in these fungi.

we used pcr to analyze the distribution of rtpc elements in  <dig> paracoccidioides isolates of different geographic origin, four of which were environmental. only line-tad-rtpc <dig> was identified in all isolates, the elements ltr-gypsy-rtpc <dig>  ltr-copia-rtpc <dig> and ltr-copia-rtpc <dig> were absent in only one isolate, and the element ltr-gypsy-rtpc <dig> could not be amplified in five isolates. the accumulation of mutations in several elements most likely explains why we failed to amplify these elements by pcr in some isolates. we could not establish any correlation between the presence of the elements and the origin of the isolate. however, the wide distribution of transposons in most paracoccidioides isolates indicates that they may have been present in the common ancestor before the speciation event.

tes can be inserted into various regions of the eukaryotic genome, including the flanking regions of euchromatic genes. there are several cases of te insertions acting in genes regulatory pathways, which can interfere with their activation or inactivation  <cit> , suffering higher selective pressures. hence, the high similarity observed between all rtpc  <dig>  rtpc <dig> and rtpc <dig> elements suggests that the elements described in the present work are still active or under purifying selection, otherwise several mutations would be expected. through phylogenetic analysis, we can infer that the two copies of the element ltr-gypsy-rtpc <dig> present in the genome of p. brasiliensis  group together with elements of the genome of p. lutzii . the retrotransposition mechanism of ltr, “copy and paste”, is equivalent to gene duplication; hence, the emergence of specific rtpc <dig> lineages in pb <dig> and pb <dig> isolates could occur concomitantly with the rtpc <dig> copies present in the common ancestor. if this process occurred independently in p. brasiliensis and p. lutzii, we should see a distribution similar to that shown in the phylogenetic trees obtained in the present work . fungal genomes exhibit a low rate of evolution  <cit> , which could explain why even the specific lineages are still very similar to the non-specific elements. then, the emergence of p. brasiliensis rtpc1-specific lineages due to the accumulation of mutations can occur concurrently with the maintenance of copies of rtpc <dig> similar to those present in the common ancestor of p. lutzii and p. brasiliensis  <cit> . however, for the line element rtpc <dig> it was possible to observe a species-specific grouping, although only a single copy of rtpc <dig> from p. brasiliensis  has been analyzed. therefore, we suggest that the rtpc elements were present in the ancestral lineage shared by p. lutzii  and p. brasiliensis  and that the inclusion of these elements must have occurred at this point, especially for ltr-gypsy- rtpc <dig> and line-tad-rtpc <dig>  the abundant number and high degree of similarity of these elements indicate that they have undergone a recent amplification process within the genomes of these species. this observation is consistent with the life-cycle of a transposable element  <cit> .

tes may have two main effects on the host genome: insertion into a new chromosomal locus when the element transposes and ectopic recombination. two copies of the same element in different chromosomal locations may act as sites for homologous recombination, the effects of which can range from small inversions to major chromosomal rearrangements, such as duplications, deletions or translocations  <cit> . a significant percentage of the paracoccidioides genome consists of transposable elements that could serve as sites for homologous recombination. in organisms without sexual reproduction, homologous recombination between tes might be associated with the generation of genetic diversity  <cit> . recent evidence suggests that paracoccidioides species have the potential to undergo sexual reproduction, although to date a sexual reproduction stage has not been described  <cit> . we identified potentially active retrotransposons in paracoccidioides genomes and also described potentially active dna transposons. recently, shankar and coworkers  <cit>  reported a high expression of retrotransposons in p. lutzii pb <dig> during the dimorphic transition and were able to suppress the transition when the fungi were treated with 17β-estradiol. paracoccidioides dimorphism can be triggered by 37°c temperatures in hosts or in culture, and the morphological differentiation that takes place during the mycelial-to-yeast transition is considered to be vital to the pathogenesis of pcm  <cit> . the transposition of active elements can have major mutational effects. te insertion near or within a gene may alter or destroy the activity of the gene in several ways, ranging from total inactivation to changes in expression levels or alternative splicing  <cit> . a recently conducted study in schizosaccharomyces pombe showed that the transcription of the ltr retrotransposon tf <dig> was induced by heat treatment, and genes that were induced by heat could be activated by tf <dig> integration. the authors speculate that tf <dig> integration has the potential to improve the survival of individual cells exposed to environmental stress  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a combined computational and experimental approach was effective in identifying and characterizing five new potentially active retrotransposons in the genomic assemblies of the paracoccidioides species complex. all elements have been found in both p. lutzii and p. brasiliensis . this finding suggests that the rtpc elements would have already been present in a common ancestor. full-length, potentially functional autonomous elements were characterized, and transcripts of all five elements have been detected. considering the growing body of evidence in the literature indicating the major importance of tes, it would be interesting to investigate the impact of active retrotransposons on the biology of these dimorphic pathogenic fungi.
