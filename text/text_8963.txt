BACKGROUND
more than half of the human genome consists of repetitive dna and tandemly repeated dna sequences comprise a significant proportion thereof. based on the size of the individual repeat units and the total array size these tandem arrays are classified as micro-, mini-, macro- and megasatellite repeats. microsatellites or short tandem repeats  for example often contain units of 1- <dig> base pairs  and can span up to 600 bp. these small repetitive sequences make up a relatively small part of the human genome that has been intensively studied. at the other side of the repeat array spectrum, macrosatellite repeats  consist of repetitive units of minimally 100 bp but are typically several kilobases  large. msrs have recently attained more attention because of their potential structural and regulatory role in the human genome. msrs are now recognized to embody an extreme example of copy number variation, often spanning hundreds of kilobases of genomic dna. a recent survey identified a large number of known and unknown msrs distributed over the entire human genome  <cit> .

some msrs, such as the macrosatellite repeat d4z <dig>  in the subtelomere of chromosome 4q, have already been studied in more detail. in the general population the d4z <dig>  msr varies between 11- <dig> copies of the d4z <dig> monomer. reduction of the d4z <dig>  repeat array below the size of  <dig> units creates a more open d4z <dig> chromatin structure that is thought to cause facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy , an autosomal dominant disease characterized by progressive wasting and weakness of the facial-, shoulder and upper arm muscles  <cit> . in the subtelomere of chromosome 10q an almost identical msr is located, but contractions of this d4z <dig>  repeat array are usually not associated with disease  <cit> . on the x chromosome the msr dxz <dig>  with a unit size of 3 kb, was shown to vary between 12- <dig> copies in a study of  <dig> individuals  <cit> . its polymorphic character is further underscored with an observed meiotic instability of  <dig> % in three ceph families  <cit> . chromatin studies have shown that dxz <dig> has opposite chromatin configurations on the active and inactive x chromosome. it is bidirectionally transcribed producing long non-coding rnas and small rnas. based on these observations this msr was suggested to play a role in the establishment or maintenance of x chromosome inactivation  <cit> .

some msrs encode for a protein-coding gene in every repeat unit. d4z <dig> for example encodes for the double homeobox protein  <dig> , a putative germ line transcription factor  <cit> . other msrs, like dxz <dig>  are thought to produce non-coding rnas which may either be important for the establishment and maintenance of the msr chromatin structure, or may have other functionalities  <cit> . therefore, there is a distinct possibility that natural size variation of msrs can affect gene expression in cis and in trans. as is the case for d4z <dig>  where repeat contraction inflicted chromatin changes result in the loss of control over the dux <dig> gene, it is not inconceivable that inappropriate transcriptional activity of any msr may have phenotypic consequences, including disease. indeed, we and others have shown that the chromatin structure and transcriptional activity of msrs is tightly controlled and that in disease conditions, like fshd and cancer, there is a loss of control over their regulation  <cit> .

some other msrs have also been studied to various levels of detail. msr rs <dig> on chromosome 4p <dig>  is composed of units of  <dig>  kb in size each encoding for a deubiquitinating enzyme  <cit> . in a study of  <dig> japanese individuals the array size of rs <dig> ranged from 20- <dig> units with evidence for somatic mosaicism and meiotic instability comparable to that reported for dxz <dig>  <cit> . msr5p, also described as taf11-like  <cit> , on chromosome 5p <dig>  was recently suggested to be involved in a psychiatric disorder  <cit> . no significant difference in repeat length distribution was observed between individuals of european and african ethnicity, based on a qpcr analysis of both alleles collectively in  <dig> individuals  <cit> . a southern blot based analysis on  <dig> individuals showed that the repeat array varied between 10- <dig> repeat units  <cit> . units of the msr flj <dig>  also described as the prr <dig> array  <cit> , on chromosome 13q <dig>  encode for a proline rich protein. in a small study of  <dig> individuals this repeat array was shown to vary in size between 5- <dig> units  <cit> . in close proximity to the brca <dig> locus resides the rnu <dig> repeat array having  <dig>  kb repeat units each encoding for a u <dig> small nuclear rna. the array length varies between 30-250 kb  <cit> . finally, ct <dig> is an x chromosomal msr, consisting of  <dig>  kb repeat units that encode for a cancer testis antigen  <cit> . normally, expression of ct <dig> is restricted to the germ line, but its transcriptional repression is lost during the oncogenic process in small cell lung carcinomas  <cit> .

some msrs have been studied only in silico  <cit> , others are studied more extensively by southern blot or pcr analysis. apart from d4z <dig>  <cit>  and msr5p  <cit> , there are no studies that have systematically interrogated repeat length variation of msrs in different populations. in this study we present the results of combined wet-lab and bioinformatic analyses of eight different msrs, mapped to different locations in the human genome . individuals from the hapmap panels representing three different populations were included in this study to investigate msr behavior on the population level. we also applied novel powerful bayesian statistical evaluation methods to analyze repeat size variation of individual msrs and all msrs collectively. this study thereby represents the first in depth collective analysis of msrs in different populations to identify commonalities and differences in the genomic regulation of msrs. our study provides evidence that msrs are large, highly polymorphic regions in our genome with multimodal size distributions and minimal array length constraints, independent of genomic localization, protein coding potential, and unit size.

RESULTS
after pfge-based repeat array sizing , bioinformatic analyses were performed on the size of the repeat array of eight different msrs in  <dig> unrelated individuals of caucasian, asian and african origin. additional parameters that were investigated include genetic heterogeneity, mitotic and meiotic instability, and multimodality. mosaic or complex repeat arrays were excluded from most analyses and only included in investigations of mitotic and meiotic instability.

for every individual the repeat size obtained by pfge analysis was recalculated into the total number of repeat units . the size distributions showed no significant gender difference for any of the autosomal repeats and dxz <dig> , therefore all unrelated individuals for each population were pooled. for the x chromosomal msr ct <dig> however, a p-value of  <dig>  suggested that men have a different size distribution compared to women. a detailed inspection of the populations separately showed that this difference was observed in the asians  but not in the caucasian  or african  population. in the asian population male individuals had on average arrays consisting of  <dig>  units compared to  <dig>  units in female individuals, however, the total size variation was very small . therefore, also for ct <dig> we analyzed all unrelated individuals collectively. because the caucasian and african populations consisted of father-mother-child-trios, the repeat lengths of the children were used as controls for our sizing method. no differences in length between parents and child were found, except for two individuals having a meiotic contraction or expansion, indicating that our sizing measurements were accurate.

genetic heterogeneity
msr sizes showed a wide range of variation confirming and extending previous reports that msrs are very large polymorphic structures in the human genome . except for flj <dig> and d4z <dig> , a minimum number of more than two repeat units was observed for each of the msrs. only for msr5p in the african population  and for dxz <dig> in the caucasian population  msr sizes were normally distributed according to the shapiro-wilk test. all msrs in the asian population were significantly skewed to longer repeat sizes and showed significant  kurtosis, where repeat sizes were more concentrated around the mean leading to more peaked distributions compared to a normal distribution, except rs <dig>  in caucasians the autosomal msrs demonstrated both skewness and  kurtosis, although the skewness was not significant for rs <dig> and no significant kurtosis was observed for flj <dig> and rnu <dig>  most distribution patterns were flattened in the african population, since  kurtosis was only found for rs <dig>  d4z <dig>  and ct <dig>  homozygosity was observed in 25% of the unrelated female individuals for ct <dig>  which was not surprising because of the little variation in repeat array length. the cumulative distribution functions  between the total sample and the three subpopulations differed significantly for six of the eight msrs . they were not significantly different for dxz <dig>  and rnu <dig> . as a consequence, we considered the total population as an inhomogeneous group and modeled the distributions of the three subpopulations separately. the distribution of the whole population was, where relevant, estimated as a weighted average of the subsamples’ distributions. this difference between the subpopulations was confirmed by an independent  t-test. both rnu <dig> and dxz <dig>  which showed similar distributions in all three populations, had similar msr means as well. the means of the remaining msrs were significantly different for at least two populations . however, when the heterogeneity of msrs between populations was significant, no msr showed consistent behavior, where e.g. lengths were always shorter in a certain population compared to another population. for ct <dig> the mean array size in the africans was significantly smaller than in the caucasian individuals. but in general, we observed a subtle shift in repeat length towards longer repeats in the african population when compared to the caucasian and asian populations.

mitotic instability
mitotic instability has been observed for d4z <dig>  <cit> , dxz <dig>  <cit>  and rs <dig>  <cit> . for d4z <dig> it was suggested that this mainly occurs during the first few cycles of cell divisions after conception and that it results in gonosomal mosaicism  <cit> . we identified one chinese male and one caucasian male child showing mosaicism for msr5p and rs <dig> respectively , indicating mitotic instability . flj <dig> was observed as a mosaic repeat in both an african father and mother . mosaicism for ct <dig> was observed in two chinese females , for dxz <dig> in one caucasian mother, one caucasian father, two chinese females, one african female child and one african male child , and for rnu <dig> in four different individuals : a chinese female, a japanese female, an african male child and an african father. finally, for d4z <dig>  we observed a mosaic repeat in a chinese female and an african father  and d4z <dig>  was found as a mosaic repeat in a chinese female and two african male children .

meiotic instability
direct analysis of meiotic instability was only possible in father-mother-child-trios, allowing repeat size comparison in children and parents in  <dig> trios. of all  <dig> trios analyzed, one african male child was found with a different repeat length than one of the parents for the flj <dig> repeat  . from the maternally inherited repeat array, either a contraction of two repeat units or an expansion of four repeat units was observed. also for rnu <dig> meiotic instability was observed in an african trio with the child presenting with a maternally inherited expansion of one repeat unit.

complex repeats
some repeats showed more than two bands on the southern blots, which could be explained by chromosomal instability of the hapmap cell lines, somatic mosaicism or a complex repeat structure. we defined a repeat as complex when the three  bands on the blot all had the same signal intensity and of which at least two were co-segregating when inherited by the offspring, through which the possibility of mosaicism or culture-induced instability was excluded. complex repeats were found for msr5p, flj <dig>  rnu <dig>  dxz <dig> and especially for rs <dig> in the african population, where up to 44% of the unrelated individuals showed a complex repeat.

multimodality
the majority of the msrs showed that certain array lengths were more prevalent than other array lengths in between, suggesting that their distributions were composed of different modes. based on the genetic heterogeneity analysis, the total population could be considered as an inhomogeneous group where size distributions differ significantly between the three subpopulations for six of the eight msrs. therefore the distributions of the three subpopulations were modeled separately. a weighted average of these three distributions was used to estimate the distribution for the aggregate population.

the modes below the 5% percentile and above the 95% percentile were excluded in the multimodality analysis to avoid influence of minor or spurious modes in the tails that may be based on one or two observations. therefore the estimated posterior probabilities of the number of modes applied for the middle 90% range of the data. these estimated probability functions and their 95% posterior intervals  for each msr were projected on the size distribution histograms, as shown in figure  <dig>  for msr5p in the total population. additional figures for the other msrs and populations are added in the supplementary data . for ct <dig> the probability for a unimodal distribution was 100% in all the subpopulations and the aggregate population . however, strong evidence for the presence of multiple modes with a posterior probability >  <dig> % was found for five of the other seven msrs. the number of modes per msr and the distance between them varied per population with a maximum of four different modes for d4z <dig> . thus, our mixture model was indeed flexible, as it allowed for distributions with one to three or four modes since the bayesian information criterion implied three or four  poisson distributions for six of the eight msrs.

in figure  <dig>  we illustrate the distribution of the modes of msr5p in the total population, where colors indicate the weight of the mode. so, for msr5p in the total population, the main mode was located around  <dig> units, the two smaller modes around  <dig> and  <dig> units, and a minor one around  <dig> units. additional figures for all populations and all msrs can be found in the supplementary data .

the modes for msr5p in the total population are also described in table  <dig>  including their corresponding size intervals. the probability that a combination of two modes is indeed existent is also indicated. to investigate whether the intervals between the modes are equidistant, the ratios of the modes’ locations were calculated, combined with their corresponding 95% and 98⅓% posterior intervals. so, for msr5p in the total population, we could not reject that the ratios of second versus first, third versus first, and third versus second mode are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , respectively. in other words, the three modes that were present with a posterior probability of more than 85% were indeed likely to be equidistant, e.g.  <dig> units,  <dig> units and  <dig> units . in the supplementary data the results for all msrs are added . ct <dig> is omitted since no multimodality was present; dxz <dig> is also omitted because it was unclear where the modes are located, e.g. if a certain number of units was a high value of the second mode or a low value of the third mode. however, for the other five msrs showing a multimodal distribution pattern, similar results as for msr5p also favored equidistance, especially for rnu <dig> and d4z <dig> . for the latter, in e.g. the caucasian population we could not reject that the ratios of second versus first, third versus first, and third versus second mode are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, possibly reflecting modes at e.g.  <dig> units,  <dig> units and  <dig> units. these modes form a subset of an equidistant range of potential modes at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> units. it may occur that one of the multiples does not show up as an actual mode, which may be a reason why the results for some of the other msrs provide a less straightforward answer regarding the potential presence of equidistant modes.

ainterval of repeat units where the corresponding mode should be located, which directly results from the data and is visualized in the bottom panels of figure  <dig>  these are the intervals with posterior probability of a  mode, whereas between these intervals the posterior probability of a mode is negligible. our findings on the modes’ locations therefore are derived from the data, not from a personal choice of intervals.

discussion
in this study we examined the repeat array size and distribution of eight msrs in three hapmap populations, a widely used panel to identify and catalog genetic similarities and differences in human beings. until now, msrs have been considerably understudied in the hapmap panel because, despite the rapid development of advanced genome research technologies, technical and bioinformatic limitations have thus far precluded detailed analysis of the sequence and composition of msrs. msr array size was investigated and analyzed in  <dig> unrelated individuals for the autosomal repeats rs <dig>  msr5p, flj <dig>  rnu <dig>  d4z <dig>  and d4z <dig>  and the x chromosomal repeats dxz <dig> and ct <dig> 

the msrs studied are highly polymorphic, some of them showing size variations of hundreds of kilobases  while for others the variation was much more limited . for dxz <dig> and msr5p a normal distribution is not rejected in the african and caucasian population, respectively, while the other msrs are significantly skewed and/or have significant  kurtosis. msrs do not show consistent behavior within or between populations, but overall we observe among asians the least genetic variation, while the africans show the highest genetic variation. this is consistent with the african origin of modern humans, where most human genetic diversity exists in the africans, indicated previously by studies of microsatellites  <cit>  and snps  <cit> .

repeat array instability can either result in contractions or expansions of the array over time. however, none of the msrs showed a skewed distribution to the shorter repeat sizes while skewness to the longer repeat sizes was often observed, indicating that repeat expansion is more common than repeat contraction. a minimum of two repeat units is required to form an array, but for most of the studied msrs we observe a higher minimum unit number, e.g. the shortest array detected for rs <dig> and msr5p is eight units. this is reminiscent of observations from repeat structures composed of much smaller unit sizes that every repeat only becomes variable in length above a certain minimum threshold  <cit> , despite the different mechanisms by which changes in copy number are being generated in these structures. microsatellite copy number variation is mainly created by replication slippage of the dna polymerase  <cit> , while previous studies showed that the preferential mechanism by which d4z <dig> msr contracts or expands is by sister chromatid exchange  <cit> . the lack of msr arrays below a certain threshold might either suggest that these sizes are less favorable by this rearrangement mechanism or that they might create an unfavorable chromatin structure and related transcriptional activity, perhaps associated with disease, as is seen for d4z <dig> in the context of fshd  <cit> . furthermore it is possible that individuals with shorter repeat arrays were missed in this analysis because of the limited sample size. however, for d4z <dig>  it is known that approximately 16% of caucasian individuals contain repeat arrays < <dig> units  <cit> . in this study, 17% of the caucasian individuals and 16% of all individuals showed d4z <dig>  array sizes of ≤ <dig> units, suggesting that for d4z <dig>  the hapmap panels are representative of a larger population. therefore it is unlikely that shorter arrays were missed because of a limited sample size. moreover, d4z <dig>  arrays < <dig> units were observed in 20% of the asian and 9% of the african individuals, indicating a shift in the prevalence of repeat array sizes where longer repeat sizes are least prevalent in asians, more in caucasians and most in africans.

we did not observe the meiotic mutation rate of  <dig> % that was found previously for dxz <dig>  <cit>  and rs <dig>  <cit> , probably because we only studied a limited number of meioses. however, a striking observation is the high mitotic instability found in all eight msrs. a mitotic recombination rate of approximately 3% has been reported earlier for the d4z <dig>  and d4z <dig>  repeat arrays in the european population, where 1% of the individuals was mosaic for d4z <dig>  and  <dig> % for d4z <dig>   <cit> . our findings indicate a comparable mitotic recombination rate of  <dig> - <dig> % in the other msrs, which is four to ten times higher than the recombination rate of  <dig> - <dig> % most often described for microsatellite repeats  <cit> . this difference in recombination rate is probably explained by the different mechanisms that generate copy number variation in these structures  <cit> . thus, msrs are prone to frequent  rearrangements and their polymorphic nature is likely a reflection of these high recombination rates.

besides meiotic and mitotic instability, for five of the eight msrs we also observed individuals showing additional bands on the southern blots that could not be explained by mosaicism or culture-induced instability. these complex repeats suggest the presence of an additional restriction site within the repeat array for the enzyme used to digest the flanking regions or the presence of a homologous or duplicated repeat array elsewhere in the genome but probably on the same locus because the two fragments were always co-segregating when inherited by the offspring. rearrangements between homologous chromosomes can also occur, which is described for d4z <dig>  and d4z <dig>  where exchanges between the repeat arrays occurred during evolution, leading to the formation of hybrid alleles, consisting of a combination of units derived from chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> .

size variation in msrs has been implicated in epigenetic control of the human genome affecting the expression of transcripts within and adjacent to the msr. therefore, their size regulation should be under strict control to avoid detrimental epigenomic consequences of copy number variation. although msrs often undergo rearrangements, our multimodality analysis indicates that these rearrangements indeed do not occur randomly. previously we proposed that the d4z <dig> array size distribution shows multimodality with three equidistant peaks at intervals of ~65 kb  <cit> . given the preferred mechanism of rearrangement, this multimodality can be based on a founder effect, where two ancestral alleles or different chromosomal backgrounds  and d4z <dig> ) give rise to size variation over time and show little inter-chromosomal interactions  <cit> . since msrs are very polymorphic, it is more likely that this multimodality is based on other factors such as chromatin restrictions where certain chromatin states are more favorable than others. in this study we observed evidence for multimodality for seven of the eight msrs, with ct <dig> being the exception showing a unimodal distribution. this presence of unimodality can be due to the small size range observed for ct <dig> where further repeat expansion can give rise to an additional mode. multimodality in the msr sizes can also arise by the presence of so-called recombination hotpots within the msr array  <cit> . as was found for segmental duplications, also msrs may be unstable dna structures and therefore contain certain sequences that can function as a hotspot of structural genomic rearrangements.

for the five msrs showing very strong evidence for multimodality, it is for msr5p, rnu <dig> and d4z <dig>  also likely that this multimodality shows equidistant intervals between the modes. the location of the modes and the distance of the intervals between the modes vary depending on the populations and the msr. the unequal location of the modes can still indicate the remnants of a founder effect, where the newly rearranged alleles originate from the ancestral ones and form a distribution around the size of the ancestral allele. during this process, arrays with energetically more favorable sizes are more frequently produced, since a higher order chromatin structure is imposed upon the msr limiting its variation in array length. thus, it seems that each msr is organized in its own specific way, constrained by its own minimal array size. however, seven msrs show multimodality and at least three of those also show equidistant intervals between the modes, suggesting a more universal organization of msrs in our genome where they are arranged into higher order chromatin structures.

by applying bayesian statistical methods in our study, we were able to perform a powerful analysis concerning multimodality in the msr size distributions. since the bayesian analysis of flexible mixtures of  poisson distributions allowed us to estimate the posterior probability without the necessity of making assumptions beforehand, it is a promising method to implement into future studies on frequencies of cnvs or gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we found substantial evidence of heterogeneity, multimodality and equidistant modes in the msr array size distributions that were investigated. considering that msrs are large repeat arrays, highly dynamic and polymorphic and covering large regions of the genome, it is imperative to get a better understanding of their structure and function. indeed, resolvement of the structural variation in the human genome, in particular this extreme form of copy number variation, can provide valuable insight into the mechanism of human genomic diseases.
