BACKGROUND
monoclonal antibodies have become important tools in several fields, including molecular biology, pharmaceutical and medical research, as well as in the treatment of diseases such as cancer and infectious diseases  <cit> . since the advent of antibody technology, antibody production has moved from hybridoma technology to recombinant dna methodology. the advantages of recombinant antibodies are several folds,  antibodies can be produced in bacteria, yeast or plant  <cit> ,  immunization is not required and  intrinsic properties such as immunogenicity, affinity, specificity and stability of antibodies can be improved by various mutagenesis technologies  <cit> . in the past two decade, advances in phage display and antibody engineering have led to the development of phage-displayed antibody technology  <cit> . this technology allows one to isolate antibodies directly from diverse repertoires of antibody genes, generating high-affinity binding sites without the constraint imposed by classical method for generating either polyclonal or monoclonal antibody  <cit> . since the method does not depend on an animal's immune system, antibodies to a wide variety of antigens, including the molecules that cannot stimulate immune system of the animals such as nonimmunogenic, "self", cell surface or toxic antigens, can be generated  <cit> . the antibodies can also be engineered to contain in-built features that suit various downstream applications  <cit>  or converted into functional whole immunoglobulin  <cit> . the antibody genes are expressed and the gene products displayed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage as fusion proteins  <cit> . this collection of phages is called a phage display antibody library, where each phage particle displays a single antibody. in order to construct a library, antibody genes are fused to phage genes, thus creating a link between antibody phenotype and its encoded genotype. antibody genes can be isolated from b-lymphocytes of non-immunized donors, rendering a naïve library which is a valuable source of human monoclonal antibodies against various antigens  <cit> . various formats of antigen-binding fragments, including fab and scfv have been cloned and displayed on phage  <cit> . the advantage of smaller antibody fragments is that they have high tissue penetrability, while maintaining their affinity and specificity  <cit> . they are also easier and faster to produce in recombinant form. however, successful construction of a human antibody phage library has been achieved only by a small number of research groups  <cit> . one reason may be because of the complexity and cost of generation of the library, even though there have been some reports describing optimized protocols for the generation of efficient libraries  <cit> .

here we report a simple and highly efficient method for the construction of a compact and highly useful scfv human library. the library was based on the naïve human re-arranged v-genes and assembled through the use of a gene repertoire derived from  <dig> non-immunized donors. all possible combinations of heavy and light chains, among all immunoglobulin isotypes, were included by using a mixture of primers and overlapping extension pcr. the resulting variable gene repertoire were cloned to form a moderate size library composed of  <dig>  ×  <dig> individual clones from one ligation reaction. this repertoire was used for selection of specific binders to different proteins, a hapten, and complex antigens i.e., viral coat proteins, crude snake venom and cancer cell surface. binding specificity and sequence diversity among binders were demonstrated.

RESULTS
construction of pmod <dig> phagemid
a novel phagemid vector, designated pmod <dig>  for the construction of phage-displayed scfv library was created . this vector was based on the phagemid vector, phage  <dig>  . a multiple cloning site was introduced, containing five restriction recognition sties, of which sfii and noti were used for the insertion of scfv gene repertoires. the gene iii leader peptide was used to direct the secretion of scfv, whereas ampicillin resistant gene was used for the selection and maintenance of the phagemid. the scfv gene was linked to the hexahistidine tag followed by myc epitope. the hexahistidine tag can be used for one-step affinity purification with immobilized metal affinity chromatography , whereas the myc epitope can be recognized by 9e <dig> monoclonal antibody for detection. an amber stop codon was introduced between the myc-tag and gene iii, thus allowing production of non-fused scfv by introduction of the phagemid dna in a non-suppressor e. coli strains .

library construction
a diagram that outlines the construction of the compact scfv antibody library is shown in figure  <dig>  peripheral blood from one hundred and forty healthy non-immunized donors was collected into four pools, according to different blood groups. these include adults at the age between 17– <dig>  both male and female, in nakhon ratchasima province. the bloods were tested and discharged from the thai red cross society blood donation unit. total rna was prepared from the b lymphocytes and pooled together before being used as templates for the construction of v-genes repertoire. a mix of oligo-dt <dig> and random hexamers were used to synthesize cdna, so that all five antibody isotypes could potentially be represented. in order to reduce amplification bias, we performed  <dig> independent pcr reactions to amplify v gene segments, using all possible combinations within a primer set . the primer sequences, which in theory encompass the entire repertoire of human antibody genes, were obtained from v base  <cit> , and modified according to previously published protocols  <cit> . the pcr reactions included six vh forward primers  paired with four vh reverse primers  which generated a total of twenty-four reactions; whereas six vκ forward primers  paired with five vκ reverse primers  generated a total of thirty reactions; and seven vλ forward primers  paired with three vλ reverse primers  generated a total of twenty-one reactions. the pcrs led to the representation in the repertoire of variable regions derived from all conceivable framework assemblies.

a total of  <dig> primers were used for the construction of the scfv library. all primers contained either sfii or noti recognition sites or linker sequence as illustrated in figure  <dig> and detailed in table  <dig>  the final pull-through pcr could be done with two primers  compatible to the 5' sfii or 3'noti segments of the heavy and light chain gene repertoires. we found that it was not necessary to add extra nucleotides 5' to the recognition sites as previous published  <cit> , provided that sufficient incubation period  was performed for each digestion reaction. after the final scfv gene repertoires had been sequentially digested with sfii and noti, they could be ligated directly into pre-digested and dephosphorylated phagemid. from one ligation reaction and two electroporations, we were able to obtain the final compact scfv library consisting of  <dig>  ×  <dig> different scfv molecules with  <dig> % of clones from no-insert ligation.

diversity of antibody fragments
to analyze the diversity of the scfv repertoire and the quality of the primary library, dna segments encoding the scfv genes from fifteen randomly picked clones were examined. the phagemid dna of these clones were amplified by pcr and digested with bstni, and their fingerprint patterns were compared. thirteen different patterns were identified as shown in figure  <dig>  dna sequence analysis of ten different clones revealed that the scfv fragments were all in-frame . the fingerprints of clone <dig> and clone <dig> were apparently identical; although their nucleotide and amino acid sequences were different. the variable regions were derived from thirteen different v gene families, including all six vh gene families  and seven vl gene families of both kappa and lambda light chain . the v-gene segments such as vh3dp <dig>  vλdpl <dig>  and vκ3dpk <dig> which are most often used in the natural b cell repertoire  <cit>  were included in the unselected library as well as other less frequent segments. the cdr <dig> of vh sequences were highly diverse, with lengths between  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. the vl sequences had between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids in their cdr <dig> regions. thus, the scfv gene fragments were distributed across the full repertoire of antibody germ line genes. the number of different amino acids from germ line varied from 0– <dig> amino acids, suggesting that both germ line b genes and antibodies from secondary immune responses were included in the library . analysis of germ line family was done by using ig blast  <cit> , and dna plot program  <cit> .

selection of scfv antibodies against various antigens
because the library is compact and a protease sensitive helper phage, km <dig>  <cit>  was used during bio-panning, only one or two round of selection were performed on eight different antigens. these antigens include pure proteins , hapten , and very complex antigens . to reduce the amount of antigens needed for each bio-panning, all antigens were immobilized on wells of 96-well elsia plate . the numbers of clones obtained from the first rounds of selection were varied, as shown in table  <dig>  after the first round of selection with a particular antigen, up to  <dig> phage clones were picked and their binding specificity determined by phage elisa. we were able to obtain at least one specific phage clone for all antigens, except for crude green pit viper snake venom. an additional round of panning increased the ratio of binders but did not increase the chance to obtain clones not already detected after the round one. as demonstrated in the case of snake venom, the nine clones that were isolated from the second round of panning were all the same and identical to the clone obtained from the first round of selection. for attenuated virus, six out of seven clones from the second round of panning were identical. the number of clones obtained from the first round of panning varied, depending on the type of the antigens and the number of washings. we found that the most appropriate number of clones after the first round of selection should vary between 100– <dig>  colonies. this result suggested that, for a compact naïve library like in this report, one round of selection is sufficient and most appropriate to obtain scfv antibodies with maximal diversity.

characterization of selected scfv antibodies
the binding of scfv to antigens was highly specific even though the antigens were very complex. for example, the selected anti-cobra venom scfv did not cross react with green viper snake venom . another example of scfv specificity is illustrated by the selection against bile duct cancer cells. one of the two clones demonstrated higher specificity for a cholangiocarcinoma cell line, when compared to cos- <dig> or hepg- <dig> cells . this experiment was done without pre-incubation or subtraction with other cell lines, demonstrating that it is possible to obtain highly specific antibodies against a complex cell surface antigen by one round of bio-panning using this compact library.

to determine the binding specificity of selected soluble scfv fragments, e. coli hb <dig> was infected with specific phage selected on different antigens. hb <dig>  unlike tg- <dig>  is not able to suppress the amber stop codon upstream of the gene iii sequence in pmod <dig> vector, thus resulting in expression of non-fused scfv. most of these clones produced functional antibody fragments which were specific to their antigen, readily detected in cell culture supernatants by elisa, as summarized in table  <dig> 

dna sequence analysis of selected scfv clones  revealed that vh genes were derived from three of the six vh gene families . families  <dig> and  <dig> have been shown to be predominating in previous reports  <cit> . comparison of the six vh sequences with their closest germline v sequence using igblast  <cit>  and v base  <cit>  revealed that they were from  <dig> different germ-line genes with various numbers of amino acid differing compared to the germ line sequences, ranging from 1– <dig>  the vl genes were from four vλ gene families  and four different germ-line genes. it is interesting that only one vκ gene  family was obtained and they were both from the same germ line genes, but different in the number of different amino acids. the vκ  <dig> family has previously found to be most frequently used in other reports as well  <cit> . the preferential usage of vh gene family  <dig> and  <dig>  especially segment dp <dig> has previously been observed  <cit> , this segment is most often used in nature  <cit> .

* cdr <dig> sequence and v-gene segment usage for both heavy and light chains of the selected antibody are reported. sequence analysis was done by ig blast  <cit>  and dna plot program  <cit>  .

analysis of the cdr <dig> regions of both vh and vl shows considerable variability in their length, ranging from 6– <dig> amino acids, which is similar to the distribution of the length of cdr <dig> in unselected library. the variations of the cdr <dig> length in vh genes  were higher than that of the vl genes . the vh cdr <dig> length and vh-gene segment frequency is similar to those observed in natural antibodies  <cit> .

we have also observed one phenomenon similar to chain promiscuity, where one light chain was found in combination with different heavy chain. the rabies b <dig> clone and the aflatoxin c <dig> clone used the same germ-line vl gene , but different vh genes . however, the cdr  <dig> regions of the two vκ genes were different. this result suggested the framework of this vκ gene segment is favourable for phage-display format. the number of different amino acids from germ line of the six selected clones varied from 1– <dig> amino acids, as seen in unselected library. this result suggested that both germ line b genes and antibodies from secondary immune responses were selected from the bio-panning. the summary of dna sequence analysis of all six selected scfv clones is shown in table  <dig> 

analysis of aflatoxin-scfv antibodies by competitive elisa
normally antibodies are selected by bio-panning against hapten conjugated to immobilizing molecules such as bsa, thus in many cases anti-hapten antibodies cannot recognize free haptens  <cit> . however, in case of haptens such as aflatoxin, it is essential for most applications that the antibody recognizes the soluble form of the hapten  <cit> . in this report we demonstrated that by using our compact scfv library and a simple bio-panning method, we were able to obtain three phage clones that could interact specifically with bsa-conjugated aflatoxin b <dig>  and one of these clones could interact specifically with soluble form of aflatoxinb <dig>  as demonstrated by inhibition elisa . this type of assay has been used as an indirect method to estimate the binding affinity of an antibody  <cit> .

discussion
phage display antibody technology has become increasing popular for creating binding sites for use in all areas of research, and in medical and industrial applications. there are several examples of successful isolation of antibodies against various antigens from different phage displayed antibody libraries  <cit> , including high throughput selection  <cit> . unfortunately, the libraries are not available commercially; any laboratories that are interested in using this technique are required to construct a library by themselves, or obtained existing libraries for research with restrictions. of the two types of phage antibody libraries , the nonimmune library is of more general use, because it can be applied to generate antibodies to any desired antigen  <cit> . these "naive" libraries normally has been constructed from the light-chain and heavy-chain igm-v-gene pools of b cells isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes, bone marrow, or spleen cells of nonimmunized healthy donors  <cit> . however, it has been reported that the diversity of the library could also be maximized by using random hexamers to prime cdna synthesis, so that all five antibody classes could potentially be represented  <cit> . since the whole antibodies cannot be functionally expressed in bacteria, only the antibody fragments that contain the binding regions are displayed on the surface of the bacteriophage  <cit> . most of the phage libraries that have been constructed display the antibody fragment on the surface of the phage minor coat proteins . it has been shown that both fab  <cit>  and scfv  <cit>  can be expressed in the surface of m <dig> without apparent loss of the antibody's specificity and affinity. since the scfv format has been shown to be more efficient for display on phage coat  <cit>  and the aim of this research was to develop the most efficient method to construct a compact human antibody, the scfv format was chosen.

several strategies have been described for producing antibody phage display library in scfv format but it is difficult to define the minimal repertoire size needed to retrieve good binders to antigens. many approaches have been proposed to improve phage displayed human antibody repertoires, mainly by increasing the library sizes  <cit> , by sophisticated in vivo  recombination method  <cit> , and by improving cloning steps  <cit> . in this study, we describe a simple and highly efficient method to construct a compact human scfv phage library, by modification of several previously published protocols  <cit> . our method needs the least number of oligonucleotide primers . the lab of j.d. marks used  <dig> primers to construct a naive library  <cit>  while the lab of j. mccafferty used  <dig> primers  <cit> . in these reports, two sets of primers were used to construct the library. the first set allow the amplification of the vh and vl gene repertoires from cdna, and the second set is used to introduce restriction sites for sub-cloning the genes into phagemid. in our work, we optimized the protocol such that only one set of primers are used to both amplify the genes and introduction of restriction sites, thus reducing the number of primers by half. moreover, in all of the previous reports on the construction of large  naïve human libraries, smaller libraries were first created and then combined together to obtain the larger libraries. for example, vaughan's library of  <dig>  ×  <dig> was generated from three sub-libraries  <cit> , sheet's library of  <dig>  ×  <dig> was generated from two sub-libraries  <cit> , and mccafferty's library of  <dig> was generated from sixteen sub-libraries  <cit> . in our work, because of the compact size, we used only a couple of ligation reactions and electroporations, compare to thirty six  <cit>  to several hundred electroporations  <cit> , and more than twelve ligation reactions  <cit>  used by others to construct the libraries. thus, one can use our method to create a compact phage display antibody library that is better than other libraries of the same size, and equally well to larger libraries, with less time and budget.

the scfv phage library was created by focusing on amplification of highly diverse re-arranged v genes, as it has been formerly suggested that the most useful scfv library are constructed from v-genes rearranged in vivo  <cit> . in order to reduce amplification bias we performed  <dig> independent pcr reactions using all possible combinations within a primer set, modified from previous reports  <cit> . the high diversity of this compact library came from the high diversity of re-arranged variable region genes, which were isolated from one hundred and forty non-immunized healthy donors. this is the highest number of re-arranged v-gene templates that has ever been reported. other reports of large and complex human scfv libraries, for example, used five  <cit> , forty two  <cit> , forty three  <cit> , or fifty  <cit>  donors.

the cdnas from peripheral blood lymphocytes of the  <dig> non-immunized donors were synthesized using a mix of random hexamers and oligo dts, so that all five antibody classes could be represented. amplification using these non-specific primers has been shown to be as efficient as using germline, vh, igg or igm, specific primers for the construction of efficient naïve repertoires  <cit> . in order to create scfv fragment genes as a vh-linker-vl type, the 3' ends of vh genes were made complementary to 5' ends of vl genes through a  <dig> linker peptide, and the vh and vl genes were assembled and amplified by overlap extension followed by pull-through pcr. moreover, to ensure the correct overlaps during assembly pcr, the three  <dig> repeat in the single chain linker region were encoded by different codons . a proof reading dna polymerase was used in the overlap extension step to ensure the accurate joining of blunt ends of vh and vl genes segments and in-frame formation of scfv repertoire. for other steps, taq dna polymerase was used due to a more efficient amplification using this polymerase. in addition, the mutations created by amplification errors could add more diversity to the library. the primer sets used for the amplification of v gene repertoires were designed based on information retrieved from v-base  <cit>  and previous publications  <cit> . the 5' and 3' ends of each primer incorporated sequences which could be cleaved by restrictions enzymes, avoiding a two step amplification procedure as previously reported for a murine scfv library  <cit> . it has been previously suggested that several hundred bps of dna sequence 5' and 3' of the scfv cloning sites is required for efficient digestion of the insert  <cit> ; however we found that this is not necessary, provided that the inserts were incubated with the restriction enzyme for at least  <dig> hour. in addition to the shortest list of primer used, the fewest steps were needed for the generation of the library. this is because only one ligation step and two electroporation were required, without the creation of sub-libraries as performed by other strategies  <cit> .

utilization of different modified helper phages to improve the bio-panning efficiency has been reported  <cit> . here, the helper phage km <dig>  <cit> , which is a protease sensitive helper phage, was used during the bio-panning. this modified helper phage encodes a modified gene iii, encoding a peptide sequence which will be cleaved by trypsin, between domain d <dig> and d <dig>  by applying trypsin cleavage following selection of the phage antibody library, the phage particles not carrying an antibody-piii fusion would lose all there domain d <dig> and d <dig> of protein  <dig>  and thus lose their ability to infect bacteria; whereas phage particles carrying an antibody-piii fusion would retain their infectivity, due to the absence of the protease sensitive site in the gene iii of the fusion. thus, in the bio-panning procedure described here, elution was done by a combination of low ph treatment with glycine buffer  and trypsin treatment. any phagemid encoded phage display library contain a large proportion of phage particles devoid of piii fusion on their surface, however these can still be retrieved following selection due to non-specific binding of phage particles. removal of phage particles carrying no scfv by trypsin digestion, greatly improve the efficiency of the selection. we found that we obtained better result when using km <dig> helper phage than regular helper phage, m13k <dig> . utilization of km <dig> helper phage also limits the number of eluted phages after the first round of section  <cit> , which would be a logic consequence of decreasing the number of background binders of non-displaying phage particles and taken together this explain why only one round of panning is sufficient for most selections done in this study.

our compact scfv antibody phage library of  <dig>  ×  <dig> scfv repertoire rendered binders to seven different antigens. the number of different antibody fragments selected with each antigen was in the same range as from other naïve scfv phage display library, even though those libraries are  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> times  <cit>  larger than ours. since we aimed to amplify as many different variable regions as possible, sequence diversity was confirmed in both the primary library and the binders retrieved after antigen selection. the high diversity of our compact scfv library was confirmed by dna sequence analysis of ten randomly picked clones from unselected library and seven selected clones. sequence analysis of the primary library indicated that variable regions were derived from all six vh and seven vl gene families. the variable regions derived from vh <dig>  vh <dig>  vh <dig>  vκ <dig>  vκ <dig>  vλ <dig>  vλ <dig> families had been commonly observed among antibody fragments from phage display libraries  <cit> , and human hybridomas  <cit> . besides variable regions derived from these preferences gene families, other less frequently used v gene families i.e., vh <dig>  vh <dig>  vh <dig>  vκ <dig>  vκ <dig>  vλ <dig>  vλ <dig> and vλ <dig> were also found in our library. these clones were derived from a number of germ line segments with varied number of amino acid substitutions, ranging from 0– <dig>  indicating excellent diversity in our scfv phage library. we observed a preference usage of certain v gene segments in unselected library  as well as in the selected clones . this is in accordance with the bias of gene segments most often found in nature  <cit>  the length  and amino acid sequence of cdr <dig> regions varied considerably, even when the genes came from the same germ line segments. none of these clones shared the same cdr <dig> sequence. these are all characteristic of the creation of naturally occurring immunoglobulin repertoire  <cit> , which involve somatic recombination during the development of b cells in the central lymphoid organs, and somatic hypermutation that operates on b cell in peripheral lymphoid organs, resulting in an affinity maturation of the antibody population  <cit> . thus, a highly diverse and compact antibody library similar to nature could be successfully constructed from a large number of v gene repertoire templates. it has been estimated that the human antibody repertoire is at least  <dig>  <cit> ; however, the number of antibody specificities present at any one time is limited by the total number of b cells in an individual, as well as by each individual's encounters with antigens, which is approximately  <dig> different specificities at any one time  <cit> . this is the same diversity of the compact library described in this paper. therefore, by performing one-round of bio-panning with this library, one can mimic natural selection and obtain a diverse pattern of binding antibodies.

even if the size of the library is essential for successful isolation of high affinity antibodies, a very large library is difficult to maintain  <cit>  and in many case, high affinity is not necessary the pre-requisite for successful application of antibody. this is because other properties such as specificity, expression level and stability are also important. the affinity of the antibody can be further enhanced by affinity maturation as previously reported  <cit> . these methods involve introduction of diversity into the antibody genes by various methods of mutagenesis such as error-prone pcr, dna or chain shuffling, or oligonucleotide-directed pcr, while affinity selection of the variants with decreasing amounts of antigens  <cit> . the affinity maturation process is useful either for improving the affinity of antibody that is selected from naive phage library of medium size  that has lower binding affinity, or for generating "super" antibody to be used in certain applications, such as diagnostic or immunotherapy. it has been reported that phage antibodies with approximately tenfold higher affinities   <cit>  than the ceiling affinity that can be obtained from in vivo selection of b-cell   <cit>  have been made by in vitro affinity maturation.

the ability to isolate an antibody that can recognize free aflatoxin from a simple bio-panning procedure underscores the high quality of our compact library. it has been well known that it is difficult to obtain antibody against free haptens  <cit> , especially from the naïve library. recombinant scfv against soluble alfatoxin that has been generated so far could only be obtained from either an optimized bio-panning method by elution with soluble haptens  <cit> , or isolated from hybridoma  <cit> . the ability to isolate antibodies that are specific to both conjugated and free aflatoxin demonstrated the high quality of this compact library. it is possible that the population of donors have been previously exposed to aflatoxin as it is a very common contaminant in the region.

in addition to hapten, we also demonstrated successful selections of specific antibodies against complex antigens, i.e., crude snake venom, cancer cell surface, and rabies virus, which are more difficult to obtain. this is because of the limited amount of target antigen present in the mixture, the background binding, and enrichment of phage antibodies specific for non-relevance antigens  <cit> . however, one cannot rule out the possibility that the apparent specific binding of antibody to complex target is actually resulted from the different level of expression of the recognized antigen. thus, characterization of these selected antibodies, as well as more investigation to determine the identities of their specific partners, are needed to be done.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, a simple method for the construction of a compact and efficient human scfv phage library has been reported. the key to the success of this method is a very high diversity v-gene repertoire template that was obtained from  <dig> non-immunized donors in combination with optimized primer set and cloning technique. this method is very practical and should be able to be carried out in any academic institutions, small research facilities, and non-profit organizations world-wide, for the generation of both naïve and immunized human phage display scfv library.
