BACKGROUND
nosocomial bacterial pneumonia is frequently polymicrobial, with gram-negative bacilli predominating  <cit> . because delays in antimicrobial treatment can lead to adverse outcomes, the choice of empirical therapy is vital. many effective antimicrobial agents are available, but the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia remains challenging. we recently reported the antibiotic-resistance patterns of respiratory isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa in our region  <cit> . the current study investigates the distribution and drug resistance of other gram-negative bacteria in the respiratory secretions of hospitalized patients.

RESULTS
table i and table ii present the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of our isolates. the most common organisms were klebsiella spp , a. baumanii , and e. coli . we also isolated rare organisms such as stenotrophomonas maltophilia, burkholderia spp, and hafnia alvei. all studied enterobacteriaceae  were far more susceptible to ticarcillin-clavulanate than to ticarcillin alone, which suggests that the primary mechanism of resistance in these organisms is β-lactamase production.

k. pneumoniae accounted for 79% of klebsiella isolates. klebsiella spp were generally more susceptible to the tested antimicrobials than were enterobacter spp, serratia spp, or e. coli. the overall resistance rates to the third-generation cephalosporins  were as follows: klebsiella spp, 10%–19%; serratia spp, 16%–33%; and enterobacter spp, 22%–45%. serratia spp were less resistant to third-generation cephalosporins than enterobacter spp. e. coli isolates resistant to piperacillin, gentamicin, and the fluoroquinolones accounted for only 4% of all e. coli isolates. imipenem was the most active agent against our isolates.

after imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and the aminoglycosides, tetracycline was the most active agent against a. baumanii. tobramycin was more effective against a. baumanii than against enterobacteriaceae. tobramycin and imipenem were the most active agents against both gentamicin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant a. baumanii .

we observed the esbl phenotype in  <dig> e. coli isolates  and  <dig> k. pneumoniae isolates . all k. pneumoniae and e. coli isolates with the esbl phenotype were resistant to tetracycline. regarding k. pneumoniae isolates,  <dig> were susceptible to tobramycin,  <dig> to gentamicin, and  <dig> to ciprofloxacin, but  <dig> were susceptible to amikacin and imipenem. regarding e. coli isolates,  <dig> were susceptible to tobramycin,  <dig> to gentamicin,  <dig> to ciprofloxacin, and  <dig> to amikacin, but all were susceptible to imipenem.

discussion
contrary to the findings of the turkish antimicrobial resistance study group  <cit> , our klebsiella isolates were more susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins , aztreonam , and ticarcillin-clavulanate . klebsiella spp were  <dig> % susceptible to ceftazidime in our study; these rates are  <dig> % in north america  <cit> ,  <dig> % in china  <cit> ,  <dig> % in korea  <cit> ,  <dig> % in latin america  <cit> , and  <dig> % in india  <cit> .

although the isolation of acinetobacter spp in respiratory specimens may reflect colonization and not necessarily infection  <cit> , the most common site of nosocomial acinetobacter infection is the lower respiratory tract, especially in mechanically ventilated patients  <cit> . acinetobacter spp were the second most frequent gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with pneumonia in latin america  <cit> . in our survey, all compounds tested showed decreased activity among the a. baumanii isolates. susceptibility to imipenem was >95% in canada  <cit> , india  <cit> , and china  <cit> ; susceptibility was  <dig> % in our study and  <dig> % in another study from turkey  <cit> . the high prevalence of respiratory tract infections due to multiresistant a. baumanii will stimulate the use of carbapenems and possibly increase carbapenem resistance in our region.

only 75% of our e. coli isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. however, this rate was greater in europe   <cit> , north america   <cit> , and latin america   <cit> . e. coli's susceptibility to ceftazidime was >95% in europe  <cit> , north america  <cit> , china  <cit> , and korea  <cit>  but only  <dig> % in latin america  <cit> ,  <dig> % in our study, and  <dig> % in india  <cit> . imipenem, the most active compound, inhibited  <dig> % of our e. coli isolates. conversely, e. coli strains were not resistant to imipenem in europe  <cit> , latin america  <cit> , india  <cit> , china  <cit> , or korea  <cit> .

enterobacter spp showed high rates of resistance to broad-spectrum penicillins with or without β-lactamase inhibitors  and third-generation cephalosporins . the high rates of ceftazidime resistance among enterobacter spp suggests a high prevalence of stably derepressed ampc cephalosporinase-producing strains. interestingly, resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam, and ticarcillin-clavulanate was higher in our study  than with the turkish antimicrobial resistance study group   <cit> . in their study, no enterobacter or serratia isolates were resistant to imipenem. in our study, however, the rates of susceptibility to imipenem were  <dig> % for enterobacter spp and  <dig> % for serratia spp. imipenem susceptibility for these two species was >95% in other parts of the world  <cit> . moreover, serratia spp were at least 95% susceptible to ceftazidime in the united states  <cit> , canada  <cit> , india  <cit> , china  <cit> , and korea  <cit> .

from  <dig> to  <dig>  esbl detection rates in k. pneumoniae isolates were  <dig> % in latin america,  <dig> % in the western pacific,  <dig> % in europe,  <dig> % in the united states, and  <dig> % in canada  <cit> ; this rate was  <dig> % in our survey, but the other study from turkey reported a rate of  <dig> %  <cit> . during this same period, esbl detection rates in e. coli isolates were  <dig> % in latin america,  <dig> % in the western pacific,  <dig> % in europe,  <dig> % in canada, and  <dig> % in the united states  <cit> ; this rate was  <dig> % in our study. the presence of the esbl phenotype in e. coli isolates decreased susceptibility to the aminoglycosides, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin but not imipenem, suggesting the presence of other resistance genes in esbl-encoding plasmids. despite the high percentage of esbl production in e. coli isolates, antibiotics remained reasonably effective with these isolates. imipenem was active against all esbl-producing e. coli isolates. e. coli remained  <dig> % resistant to gentamicin; this resistance rate was  <dig> % in the western pacific,  <dig> % in latin america,  <dig> % in europe, and  <dig> % in the united states  <cit> .

only  <dig> %– <dig> % of esbl-producing k. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to imipenem in the united states, latin america, the western pacific region, and canada  <cit> . our rate  was very high in comparison. this finding may be due to our low number of isolates or our lack of a confirmation test for the esbl phenotype. resistance to tetracycline among esbl-producing k. pneumoniae strains was  <dig> % in canada,  <dig> % in the western pacific,  <dig> % in latin america,  <dig> % in europe, and  <dig> % in the united states  <cit> , but this rate was 100% in our study. resistance to ciprofloxacin among esbl-producing k. pneumoniae strains was  <dig> % in the western pacific,  <dig> % in the united states,  <dig> % in europe,  <dig> % in latin america,  <dig> % in canada, and  <dig> % in our study.

we found only one imipenem-resistant e. coli isolate. it was resistant to ampicillin, ticarcillin, and piperacillin but susceptible to ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and aztreonam. this profile suggests an oxacillinase with carbapenemase properties. this finding is interesting because class d enzymes have been found only in acinetobacter spp  <cit> . two imipenem-resistant klebsiella spp were resistant to all β-lactams, including aztreonam. these species were probably expressed a metallo-β-lactamase with additional mechanisms   <cit> .

the absence of a confirmation test for the esbl phenotype limits the impact of our results. on the other hand, it is known that supplemented media  can alter the zone diameters for several agents and bacterial species. despite these limitations, our data can be used for local therapeutic choices.

CONCLUSIONS
we previously presented the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of  <dig> respiratory isolates of p. aeruginosa during the same period  <cit> . when combined with our current data, these results show that, in our region, ceftazidime can still be used for managing respiratory infections due to gram-negative aerobic bacteria in combination with aminoglycosides. it appears that increasing imipenem resistance may cause serious therapeutic problems in future.
