BACKGROUND
sigma factors are subunits of the rna polymerase complex responsible for specific recognition and melting of promoter dna, which enable the polymerase to initiate transcription. all eubacteria of known genome sequence code for at least one sigma factor, called primary, housekeeping or vegetative, and most encode additional sigma factors. for example, streptomyces coelicolor or sorangium cellulosum carry as many as  <dig> to  <dig> predicted sigma factors  <cit> . these so-called alternative sigma factors may be induced or activated by specific environmental signals, and consequently redirect transcription by competitively associating with the core rna polymerase. alternative sigma factors have been shown to mediate various cellular responses linked to stress conditions, growth transitions or morphological changes and development  <cit> .

sigma factors are classified into two structurally and evolutionarily distinct superfamilies  <cit> , σ <dig> and σ <dig>  most eubacterial sigma factors belong to the σ <dig> superfamily, which is further divided into four phylogenetic groups on the basis of protein structure and physiological function  <cit> . group  <dig> comprises the housekeeping sigma factors. group  <dig> is close to group  <dig> but accommodates non essential sigma factors, including the master regulator of general stress response in stationary phase, rpos, as was well characterized in escherichia coli. sigma factors in group  <dig> are phylogenetically diverse, and regulate major cellular functions such as sporulation, motility, heat-shock or general stress response. group  <dig>  known as the extracytoplasmic function  subfamily, has been distinguished more recently. it comprises highly diverged sigma factors mainly involved in responses to extracytoplasmic stimuli, which may affect the correct folding of envelope proteins. these factors typically contain only domains refgrped to as  <dig> and  <dig>  involved in core polymerase binding and promoter dna recognition and melting  <cit> , with a spacer domain of less than  <dig> residues  <cit> . however, due to the high divergence across sigma factors, their classification in the previously identified phylogenetic groups may need to be revised, and new cellular functions controlled by sigma factors may be discovered  <cit> .

our research concerns a putative σh factor in the lactic acid bacterium lactobacillus sakei. the closest characterized homolog is the σh of bacillus subtilis , encoded by sigh , which is best-known for its role in initiating sporulation, an ultimate differentiation response to starvation. σbsuh directs transcription of genes involved in polar septum formation and provokes induction of several regulator genes that in turn affect expression of signaling pathways or turn on pathways for endospore engulfment   <cit> . σbsuh is also associated with genetic competence, which enables the uptake of exogenous dna and its assimilation as new genetic information, leading to natural genetic transformation. this transient state occurs in about 10% of the cells as part of the same nutrient depletion response as sporulation. σbsuh increases expression of one of the two peptide pheromones needed for optimal activation of the master regulator of the competence pathway comk  <cit> . while σbsuh is essential for initiating sporulation, its absence reduces, but does not abolish transformation   <cit> . the whole decision-making pathway leading to sporulation or competence is an elaborate signal transduction network relying on multiple partners  <cit> . in addition, σbsuh reportedly affects expression of about 10% of the genome and was proposed to be involved in the growth transition to stationary phase  <cit> .

the position of σbsuh in the tree of σ70-type sigma factors is unclear. it exhibits structural characteristics similar to ecf sigma factors , yet phylogenetic analyses placed it between groups  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . unexpectedly, database and phylogenetic analyses revealed that σh-like gene products are largely distributed in various members of the firmicutes, sporulating or not  <cit> . interestingly, σh-like factors appear to be more divergent across non-sporulating bacteria than in sporulating bacteria  <cit> . at the same time, structural elements similar to the conserved gram-positive dna uptake machinery appeared to be encoded in the genome in members of the firmicutes not known for being naturally transformable, suggesting that this capacity may be more widespread than previously expected  <cit> . two factors, classified in a single large σh-family of sigma factors by morikawa et al.  <cit> , are directly involved in transcription of competence genes in non-sporulating bacteria: the well-known comx of naturally transformable streptococci  <cit> , and the product of the so-called sigh gene of staphylococcus aureus, a species which has not yet been shown to be transformable  <cit> . these observations suggested the link between σh-like factors and genetic competence in non sporulating firmicutes  <cit> .

l. sakei belongs to the microbiota that develops on meats under storage, especially during vacuum packing. it is largely used as a starter for the manufacture of fermented sausages in western europe and its potential use in meat product biopreservation is currently under study  <cit> . survival of l. sakei ranges from one day in aerated chemically defined liquid medium, to a few months in dry sausages, although little is known about the factors determining its stability. the existence in l. sakei of sighlsa, an apparent sighbsu ortholog, led us to identify the gene set regulated by σlsah, and to determine whether and how this regulator is implicated in competence and stationary phase survival. a strain allowing experimental sighlsa induction was constructed, and used in a genome-wide microarray study. genes activated by sighlsa overexpression appeared mainly involved in genetic competence, although we could not obtain evidence for natural transformation. this study provides further suggestive evidence that the conserved role of the σh-like sigma factors in non-sporulating firmicutes is to activate competence gene expression.

RESULTS
identification of sigh in the genome of l. sakei and other lactobacilli
automatic annotation of the l. sakei  <dig> k genome  <cit>  identified lsa <dig> as a coding sequence  of a putative alternative sigma factor of the σ <dig> superfamily. it belongs to cog <dig> , which comprises both ecf-type sigma factors  and σh of b. subtilis, and thus reflects the reported structural proximity between ecf sigma factors and σbsuh  <cit> . the conserved genetic context of the l. sakei lsa <dig> locus and the b. subtilis sigh locus, and more generally the local synteny between several members of the firmicutes , revealed that lsa <dig> and sighbsu are likely orthologous genes, belonging to a widespread family in the firmicutes.

nevertheless, the locus comprising σh-like gene may have experienced genetic rearrangements across the different genera and also among species of the same genus . moreover, the σh-like gene location seems to be variable in members of the firmicutes, especially in the lactobacillales . a putative σh-like gene is not found at the same location in lactobacillus salivarius as in l. sakei . likewise, the location of the unique gene for the comx factor differs in the naturally competent streptococcus thermophilus lmd <dig> from those of each of the identical comx copies in s. pneumoniae r <dig>  in which both copies are adjacent to a trna gene and ribosomal operons.

although the genetic context of the σh-like locus is very well conserved between l. sakei and lactobacillus plantarum, the two σh-like proteins share only 29% amino acid  identity. indeed, the level of inter-species aa identity of σh-like gene products across the genus lactobacillus is low . the lsa <dig> gene product shares weak aa identity with the σh factors of b. subtilis  and s. aureus , as well as 22% aa identity with comx of s. pneumoniae . due to the high sequence divergence between sigma factors, a robust phylogeny is difficult to achieve. tentative clustering of σh-like sigma factors , also including sporulation and known ecf sigma factors of b. subtilis, separates σbsuh from the other sigma factors in that species and argues for the existence of a σh-type family in firmicutes  <cit> . σh-like factors appear to form groups mostly congruent with the genus phylogeny, irrespective of the location of the relevant gene in the genomes . the σh-like sigma factors of lactobacilli added a fourth group to the three previously reported groups   <cit> . lsa <dig> exhibits the characteristics of a σh-like factor encoding gene and, in view of the conserved genetic context between l. sakei and b. subtilis, was called sigh. note that the name sigx has been chosen for recently annotated genomes of lactobacillales. although the name sigx is more appropriate than comx for a sigma factor, it adds confusion with the existing sigx sigma factor of b. subtilis, which is not the equivalent of σh. this certainly calls for a unified nomenclature of sigma factors in firmicutes.

conservation of sigh genes in the l. sakei species
we asked whether sigh genes were conserved among l. sakei isolates exhibiting a broad intraspecies diversity  <cit> . based on the presence or absence of markers of the flexible gene pool, l. sakei isolates from various sources were previously classified into distinct genotypic clusters, possibly affiliated with two prevailing sub-species  <cit> . the 5' and 3' ends of the sigh gene were used as targets for pcr amplification of  <dig> isolates belonging to  <dig> of the  <dig> reported clusters of the species  <cit> . a unique fragment of the same size as that of strain  <dig> k was amplified for all samples, indicating that the gene is likely present in all tested isolates. further analysis of the locus was undertaken for  <dig> of these strains distributed in  <dig> clusters. amplification obtained with primers designed on the basis of the l. sakei  <dig> k genome outside of sigh suggested that the genetic context is conserved in all these strains . polymorphism analysis of the sigh sequences brought additional information. as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> polymorphic sites were identified in the sigh cds, of which only  <dig> were involved in  <dig> aa changes, mostly conservative. thus, sigh function and coding gene location appear to be conserved in the l. sakei species.

l. lactis subspecies lactis and cremoris exhibit two comx allelic types whose nucleotide divergence is at most  <dig> %  <cit> . in contrast, sigh divergence  was incongruent with the previously reported genotypic classification of l. sakei strains  <cit> , and its two proposed subspecies . this discrepancy may be explained either by a particular evolutionary history of that gene in l. sakei or by the possibility that the classification based on the flexible gene pool does not reflect the phylogenetic relationships between strains which remain to be established.

high nucleotide divergence between species, contrasted with generally higher conservation within species, was also observed for sigh loci in the genus staphylococcus  <cit> . the reason for such high inter-species polymorphism is unknown. however, rapid evolution after species divergence rather than lateral gene transfer may be responsible, as the phylogeny of sigh genes was reported to be concordant with species phylogeny in staphylococci  <cit> .

as reported in this paper, functional studies were further conducted on rv <dig>  a derivative of l. sakei strain  <dig> k, for which genome data is available, and in which the endogenous β-galactosidase encoding gene is inactivated, thus enabling the use of a lacz reporter gene  <cit> .

temporal transcription of sigh
in b. subtilis, sighbsu transcription increases from mid-exponential to stationary phase  <cit> . we used quantitative pcr  following reverse transcription to determine if sighlsa expression in l. sakei is also temporally regulated. l. sakei was cultivated in chemically defined medium  at 30°c and total rna was extracted from cells  <dig> h after inoculation and every hour from  <dig> to  <dig> h. in these experiments, transition to stationary phase was observed between  <dig>  and  <dig> h. three genes, ldh, gyra and siga, were initially evaluated as candidate internal standards for qpcr, based on previously used standards in oenococcus oeni  <cit> . we selected ldh, which showed the least variation of mrna levels during growth . sighlsa mrna levels were then quantified relative to the early-exponential condition  chosen to calibrate the measurements, and by normalizing with ldh mrna. results showed a slight increase  of sighlsa transcripts around the transition to stationary phase . this transcription pattern is close to that reported for b. subtilis, for which sighbsu transcription reached a 3-fold increase peak  <dig> min before transition to stationary phase in sporulation medium  <cit> . possibly, the observed level of sighlsa induction could be greater in other media and growth conditions. sighbsu repression during exponential growth phase relies on the transcriptional repressor abrb, a major transition-state regulator in b. subtilis  <cit> . as no homolog of abrb could be identified in l. sakei, we suspect that other regulatory circuit may be involved in controlling sighlsa. interestingly, s. aureus sighsau transcription reportedly decreases 10-fold from early-exponential to stationary phase  <cit> .

overexpression of σh
the sighlsa gene was overexpressed as a means to reveal genes that it specifically regulates. sighlsa was placed under the control of the copper-inducible l. sakei promoter patky, present on plasmid prv <dig>  <cit> , and the resultant plasmid was introduced into rv <dig> wild-type  strain. the resulting strain, designated sigh*, thus has an additional expression-controlled copy of sigh and was compared to the equivalent wt strain harboring the prv <dig> plasmid, in which patky controls lacz . we anticipated that competence genes, found in the l. sakei genome and likely coding for a dna uptake machinery  <cit> , might be target genes for transcription by σh-directed rna polymerase . we therefore used qpcr to monitor sighlsa and comea transcripts produced by cells at  <dig> h  and  <dig> h  after induction in mid-exponential phase, or without induction. addition of cuso <dig> to the strain harboring the control plasmid had no detectable effect on the amount of sighlsa and comea transcripts . in contrast, induction of the patky-controlled copy of sighlsa led to a ~40-fold effective increase of sigh transcripts after  <dig> h, and ~ 200-fold after  <dig> h. comea transcript levels were highly increased , but only when sighlsa was  <dig> fold over-expressed . the need for high sighlsa overexpression may indicate the need to overcome posttranscriptional controls to produce enough active σlsah. this proposal is supported by observations in b. subtilis, where σbsuh was shown to be subjected to multiple controls  <cit> , and in the genus streptococcus, where high levels of comx overexpression were required to artificially induce competence  <cit> , likely due to the negative control of comx stability by a clp protease complex  <cit> .

$ expressed as fold change of transcripts amounts of each gene in each given sample relative to the indicated calibrator and normalized with ldh. results are the mean of two independent experiments. the level of ldh transcripts was stable, irrespective of the copy number or induction status of sigh . note that sigh is present at one  copy in sigh* and at two copies  in sigh*; the transcription of both is measured simultaneously. ni and i refer to 'not induced' and 'induced', respectively.

comea transcription was not increased at the onset of stationary phase in the wt nor in the induced sigh* strain, suggesting that the competence genes are not naturally induced under laboratory conditions. activation of comea tended to diminish after a four hour-induction despite high levels of sighlsa transcripts, possibly indicative of another regulatory loop on comea or post-transcriptional regulation of sighlsa. this transcription pattern was similar for comga exhibiting a 280-fold increase in transcript amounts one hour after sighlsa induction in sigh* followed by a 3-fold decrease between one and four hours. these results show that in l. sakei, conditions of σlsah overexpression lead to activation of comea and comga. nevertheless, other factors likely modulate com gene expression, as suggested from the drop of expression late in growth.

global transcriptome profiling of the σh overexpression strain suggests the existence of a genetic competence state
to identify the genes of l. sakei regulated by σlsah, the experimental system described above was used in a full-genome comparative transcriptome analysis of sigh* and sigh* after one hour induction with  <dig> μm cuso <dig>  quantification and statistical analysis of the microarray data  led to relatively few differentially expressed candidate genes. the overexpressed sigh gene in sigh* was  <dig> ±  <dig> times induced compared to the wt strain in this microarray experiment; qpcr-based quantification of the same rna samples showed a  <dig> ± 42-fold greater expression relative to the wt strain, confirming the successful overexpression of sighlsa. differences in fold ratios between microarray-profiling and qpcr analysis are not unusual but were high in our experiment; they might reflect a less efficient detection on microarray or an overestimation by qpcr especially when genes are weakly expressed in one of the conditions, which seemed to be the case for the com genes.

based on statistical tests , our microarray analysis initially identified some  <dig> candidate genes whose expression was likely affected by sighlsa overexpression; behavior of several genes was confirmed by qpcr . the known genes can be grouped into two main functional categories: competence  and dna metabolism. all the late competence  operons encoding structural elements of the dna uptake machinery were highly activated by sighlsa overexpression. in contrast, transcription of ssb, regulated as a late competence gene in b. subtilis  <cit> , was nearly constant or only very weakly induced. other genes involved in dna metabolism, and known to be induced during the competence state in other species, i.e., recombination genes reca and dpra, both of which are involved in natural bacterial transformation in different species  <cit> , gave a contrasted picture when their transcription was specifically measured by qpcr. whereas reca was little activated, expression of dpra was highly induced in the sigh* context .

$ expression ratios represent the fold change in amounts of transcripts in the strain overexpressing sigh relative to the wt control strain. for the microarray experiment they were calculated from log2ratio; for the qpcr they were calculated by the 2-ΔΔct method described in methods. genes underexpressed in the context of sigh overexpression have a ratio <  <dig>  standard deviation is indicated .

§ see additional file 3: competence dna uptake machinery of b. subtilis and comparison with l. sakei.

£ not found statistically differentially expressed in the microarray transcriptome experiment, checked by qpcr.

two genes coding for hypothetical proteins, lsa <dig> and lsa <dig>  were down-regulated in the sighlsa overexpression strain. as sigma factors are usually positive regulators, we consider it likely that down-regulation of these genes is an indirect effect of sighlsa overexpression, e.g., this effect could correspond to σh-mediated activation of an unidentified repressor. the sole transcriptional regulator  listed as σh-activated in table  <dig> is probably not responsible for this effect, since merr-type regulators reportedly act as activators  <cit> . no clue for the function of lsa <dig> could be drawn from the genetic context or multiple alignments with other merr-type proteins from e. coli and b. subtilis.

overall, the qpcr analysis validates our statistical analysis of the microarray data based on the common variance model associated with the correction of bonferroni . indeed, although calculated expression ratios were very similar for comfa and ssb , the former, which had an associated p value <  <dig>  with the bonferroni correction, was confirmed as overexpressed in the qpcr analysis, whereas the latter  was found to be almost unaffected by σh in the qpcr analysis . therefore, we expect that all genes with a better score than comfa in the microarray anlaysis  are good candidates for belonging to the σlsah regulon. altogether, results of this study thus identify  <dig> genes as belonging to the σlsah regulon. some genes , while truly activated by σlsah, may not be detected in this microarray experiment, indicating the need for further studies to define the full regulon.

transcriptional reprogramming caused by sighlsa overexpression is consistent with the existence of a competent state in l. sakei, supported by the observed up-regulation of com genes involved in pseudopilus morphogenesis and dna translocation as well as of dpra . ssb and reca appear little or not activated one hour after sighlsa induced overexpression, whereas their level of induction during the competence state in s. pneumoniae and b. subtilis reportedly varies from  <dig> to over ten-fold  <cit> . these genes might be transiently regulated , regulated by other factors, or their up-regulation may not be required in l. sakei. indeed both genes participate in the bacterial vegetative life cycle and are expected to be transcribed at a significant basal level when cells are not in the competence state  <cit> . interestingly, l. sakei possesses a unique ssb gene , whereas b. subtilis and s. pneumoniae have paralog genes  <cit> . the need for a transformation-dedicated ssb protein has been discussed  <cit> . although known natural transformation is frequently associated with multiple ssb in firmicutes  <cit> , an additional competence-induced ssb may be a facilitator rather than an essential contributor to the transformation process, since transformation frequency is only reduced by two- to ten-fold when ssbb is inactivated in s. pneumoniae or in b. subtilis  <cit> .

is l. sakei capable of natural genetic transformation?
as the σh-activated transcriptome of l. sakei was indicative of a competence state, we looked for genetic transformation in this species. the first strategy involved the overproducer strain sigh*. as the strain harbors a resident plasmid conferring erythromycin resistance, a compatible plasmid conferring chloramphenicol resistance  was used for transformation tests. after cultivation under inducing conditions , the strain was mixed with  <dig> ng of pvi <dig> and plated on selective medium. experiments were performed under various conditions: i) glucose concentration at 1% or  <dig> %, ii) growth in microaerobiosis or aeration, and induction at early, middle or late exponential phase iii) addition of mgcl <dig>  during contact between cells and dna, after middle phase induction in microaerobiosis or aeration; in addition, chromosomal l. sakei dna  was also used as exogenous dna. none of the tested conditions resulted in dna transformation.

development of natural transformation may be strain-dependent  <cit> . we therefore used a second strategy  to test different l. sakei isolates for competence, using a protocol where dna and strains are deposited on solid medium. in addition to  <dig> k, four strains  were chosen based on their different genotypes and genome sizes, and known capacities to be transformed by electroporation  <cit> ; chaillou and anba, personal communication]. two replicative plasmids and chromosomal l. sakei dna were used. in spite of varying media  and incubation temperatures , no colonies were recovered on selective medium.

among the lactobacillales, natural genetic transformation has been reported for many species of the genus streptococcus  <cit>  and has been suspected for one lactobacillus  <cit> . in recent years, natural transformation has been demonstrated in several gram-positive or gram-negative species, previously unsuspected to develop genetic competence  <cit> . overproduction of the activator protein has proven to be an efficient way to trigger genetic transformation in various bacteria, e.g., tfox in vibrio cholerae  <cit>  or comk in bacillus species  <cit> . however, artificially raising transcription of the comx master regulator gene initially failed to induce efficient genetic transformation for s. thermophilus strain lmd- <dig>  <cit> , which was very recently shown to be efficiently naturally transformable  <cit> . in the present and previous studies, a failure to achieve a competent state in bacteria  may be due to the use of inappropriate growth conditions, which might not allow the detection by the cells of a needed specific triggering factor  <cit>  or the full activation of multiple converging regulatory pathways  <cit> . as such, in the case of l. lactis  <cit> , s. pyogenes  <cit> , s. aureus  <cit> , or l. sakei , only the activation of several competence genes, but not genetic transformation, could be obtained after ectopic expression of the activating sigma factor. our results suggest that some of the genes induced in other naturally competent firmicutes are not activated by the sole sighlsa overexpression in l. sakei. in the case of s. pyogenes, the identification of a novel pheromone in related species of streptococcus might pave the way for deciphering a natural genetic transformation system in this bacterium  <cit> . whether competence gene activation by comx/σh is linked to the capacity of being transformable in these species, and under which conditions, remains to be determined.

effect of sigh on l. sakei survival
no indication of another large adaptive response triggered by σlsah could be deduced from the few other up-regulated genes distributed in different functional categories. we also searched for phenotypic effects linked to a putative role of σh on survival in stationary phase or after dna damage. for that purpose, we constructed a sigh null mutant  and compared the effect of overexpression or absence of σlsah relative to wt strains on growth and stationary phase survival in mcd medium under aerobiosis, microaerobiosis or anaerobiosis, as well as on uv resistance. no changes in any of the above tests could be attributed to σh expression levels under the conditions tested . interestingly, all the strains revealed uv resistance, since the fraction of each population killed by  <dig> nm irradiation was in the range of 0-5% at  <dig> j.m- <dig>  60-70% at  <dig> j.m- <dig>  95-98% at  <dig> j.m- <dig> and  <dig> - <dig> % at  <dig> j.m- <dig>  this is to be compared to the reported 100% killing of lactobacillus brevis exposed to  <dig> nm uv light at  <dig> j.m- <dig>  <cit> . competition experiments in mixed cultures revealed no imbalance in growth or survival between the σh overproducing or σh deficient and wt strains in mcd medium . as mcd medium may not represent a usual environment for the bacterium, a meat-derived medium was tested for comparison of sigh and wt strains. l. sakei showed prolonged stationary phase survival in meat juice, where about one percent of the population was still alive after one month at 30°c . inactivation of sigh brought no striking change to the phenotype.

CONCLUSIONS
this study gives further insight into the function of σh-family sigma factors from firmicutes, whether they belong to sporulating or non-sporulating bacteria. two main models emerge: comx of non-sporulating streptoccoci is the master activator of the genetic competence pathway, participating directly in the transcription of late com genes  <cit> . σh of b. subtilis activates a complex response leading to spore formation as an ultimate outcome and to the development of genetic competence during a transition period. unlike comx, σbsuh does not directly activate genes encoding the dna uptake machinery, but participates as an intermediate in the upstream signaling pathway controlling the master regulator of competence comk  <cit> . sigh genes from the non-sporulating l. sakei and s. aureus species are organized similarly to the sigh locus of the sporulating bacterium b. subtilis. however, unlike b. subtilis, they act like streptococcal comx by activating late com genes . we speculate that this function may be conserved in the order lactobacillales, irrespective of the exact location of the so-called comx or σh encoding gene. the regulon of σlsah as deduced by assessing the effects of σlsah overexpression was rather small. it should be mentioned that the genome size of the model strain used was  <dig> kb less than the average size within the species  <cit>  and that our strategy mainly identified genes that were strongly affected by σlsa,h independently of possible other, undetermined, environmental signals. a large number of reported regulatory effects of σbsuh are actually mediated in conjunction with other transcriptional regulators, especially spo0a and abrb  <cit> . l. sakei and more generally lactobacillales do apparently not possess orthologs of these regulatory proteins, neither do they possess a comk homologue. deciphering all the functions of the conserved σh sigma factor in other groups of firmicutes, sporulating or not, and equipped with different combinations of these known global regulators will probably help to clarify σh evolution in this group of bacteria.
