BACKGROUND
protein phosphorylation, catalysed by protein kinases, regulates a variety of activities in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. it plays a critical role in cellular response to environmental stimuli by regulating gene expression and enzyme activity. protein serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases are widespread among prokaryotes although they were identified much later than in their eukaryotic counterparts  <cit> . the first example of ser/thr kinases in cyanobacteria was reported in nostoc sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit> . complete sequencing of the nostoc genome has since revealed the existence of a family of  <dig> putative ser/thr and tyr kinases, indicating their important role in the physiology of this bacterium. nostoc is a filamentous cyanobacterium that, in the absence of combined nitrogen, is able to differentiate specialized cells called heterocysts for molecular nitrogen fixation  <cit> . ntca, a global transcriptional regulator of the crp  family is necessary for the initiation of heterocyst differentiation, as well as for carbon and nitrogen metabolism in general  <cit> . the effector of ntca is 2-oxoglutarate, which constitutes the molecular signal inducing cellular differentiation. the mutant strain cse <dig> corresponding to an insertional mutant of ntca, is unable to grow on either nitrate or dinitrogen whereas it grows on ammonium  <cit> .

one of the most important limiting factors for cyanobacterial growth in aquatic ecosystems is iron deficiency. cellular responses have evolved to cope efficiently with such frequently occurring iron-limited conditions. the transcriptional regulator fura orchestrates the cellular response to iron deficiency in nostoc pcc  <dig>  <cit> . a finely tuned iron homeostasis is essential since an excess on the one hand generates the hydroxyl radical, a highly reactive oxidant, through the oxidation of iron in the fenton reaction  <cit> . on the other hand, in cyanobacteria, iron deficiency also generates reactive oxygen species leading to oxidative damage  <cit> . moreover, fura has been shown to regulate a number of genes important in cellular defence against oxidative stress including, among others, several genes encoding thioredoxins and the alr <dig> gene encoding the dna stress binding protein dpsa  <cit> .

we have previously reported that the pkn <dig>  gene encoding a putative ser/thr kinase is induced by both iron starvation and oxidative stress in nostoc  <cit> . our findings in the present study show that the transcription of pkn <dig> is also induced under nitrogen starvation, and is under the control of fura and ntca. using a microarray approach, we identified all the gene transcripts displaying a change in abundance in the pkn <dig> mutant with respect to the wild type strain challenged by nitrogen starvation or peroxide stress. by comparing the transcript profiles of wt and pkn <dig> mutant under these two conditions, we propose a working model for how pkn <dig> functions within a signalling cascade connecting the global transcript changes in response to these two stresses.

RESULTS
ntca and fura regulators interact with the pkn <dig> promoter
in silico analysis of the pkn <dig> promoter region  revealed the presence of a putative ntca binding site  centred around  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site defined by mitschke et al.  <cit>  . it also uncovered a putative fura binding site composed of three repeated a/t rich regions between positions -  <dig> and + <dig> relative to the + <dig> transcription . to investigate whether ntca and fura, through binding to their respective putative binding sites, directly control the transcription of the pkn <dig> gene, we performed electrophoretic motility shift assays . the results presented in fig. 1b, c indicate that both fura and ntca proteins are able to bind specifically to the pkn <dig> promoter in vitro. the interaction of ntca with ppkn <dig> was dependent on the presence of 2-oxoglutatrate in the binding buffer . in the emsa analysis the promoter of nifj gene  served as a negative control .fig.  <dig>

regulation of pkn <dig> expression in response to environmental stimuli
our emsa data suggest that the expression of pkn <dig> is under the dual control of ntca and fura. we have previously reported the induction of pkn <dig> gene transcription in response to oxidative stress  <cit> . we wished to analyse whether this control is achieved by fura. since the fura gene is essential under these conditions and therefore a fura mutant is not viable  <cit> , we assessed the expression of pkn <dig> by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  using rnas extracted from the nostoc wild type  strain or a strain overexpressing the fura gene . the strains used were first incubated with or without 100 μm hydrogen peroxide  during 1 h. the data presented in fig. 2a show a slight decrease of  <dig>  fold of pkn <dig> induction in response to 1 h peroxide stress when fura was overexpressed, suggesting that fura might repress the pkn <dig> promoter in vivo. we then compared the levels of pkn <dig> mrnas in response to peroxide stress between the wt strain and strain cse <dig> in which the ntca gene is inactivated  <cit> . the induction of pkn <dig> expression in response to 1 h h2o <dig> stress was abolished in the cse <dig> strain , indicating a requirement for ntca to activate pkn <dig> transcription under this condition. since ntca expression was not induced after h2o <dig> treatment , we suggest that the activation of pkn <dig> transcription by ntca may rely on an allosteric modification of this regulator under such conditions.fig.  <dig>

interestingly, the level of pkn <dig> transcription increased from 3 h after nitrogen step down . such an increase was absent in the cse <dig> mutant, suggesting that the ntca protein activated pkn <dig> transcription under combined nitrogen starvation. the mechanism of action of ntca in response to nitrogen step down has been clearly elucidated. it relies on the interaction of this transcriptional regulator with 2-oxoglutarate, which is the molecular signal of combined nitrogen starvation  <cit> .

pkn <dig> regulon in response to peroxide stress
to address the molecular basis of the pkn <dig> signalling process, we began by performing a global transcription analysis of the pkn <dig> mutant compared to the wt strain under different growth conditions. the nostoc whole genome microarray from agilent was used as described previously  <cit> . the pkn <dig> insertion mutant used in this study was obtained previously and was shown to have a growth defect under combined nitrogen starvation, when compared to the wild type strain. this mutant was also demonstrated as unable to sustain growth under oxidant conditions  <cit> . the pkn <dig> gene is the first gene of an operon which also encodes the peroxiredoxin prxq-a and the cysteine desulphurase osis  <cit> . in order to avoid a putative polar effect of the pkn <dig> mutation and to determine which genes are under the control of pkn <dig>  we used in our transcriptomic analysis a pkn <dig> mutant strain harbouring a prl <dig> plasmid bearing a wild type copy of the pkn <dig> gene under the control of the pete promoter. the resulting recombinant strain was named wt#pkn22/pete-pkn <dig> 

the results of our rt-pcr experiment presented in fig. 3a show that whereas the induction of pkn <dig> gene expression after a peroxide treatment was abolished in the pkn <dig> mutant compared to the wt strain, the pkn <dig> gene was expressed in the absence and presence of peroxide in the wt#pkn22/pete-pkn <dig> strain which is consistent with the transcription of this gene from the pete promoter. before using this strain in our transcriptomic analysis, we wanted to check if the expression of the pkn <dig> gene under the pete promoter actually complemented the pkn <dig> mutation. for this purpose, we analysed the presence of the cp43′ protein in cyanobacterial cultures challenged with iron starvation. cp43′ is a chlorophyll-binding protein conserved among cyanobacteria and produced in response to iron starvation and oxidative stress  <cit> . under these conditions, cp43′ forms an antenna around photosystem i  <cit> , an association which results in a shift of the 680-nm chlorophyll a absorption peak towards lower values of the spectrum  <cit> . in nostoc, this association requires pkn <dig>  <cit> . we exploited this requirement for pkn <dig> to confirm the complementation of the pkn <dig> mutation. for this, the wild type, the pkn <dig> mutant and the wt#pkn22/pete-pkn <dig> strains were grown in the presence or absence of iron and the absorption spectra of the cultures were analysed. while the shift of the 680-nm chlorophyll a absorption peak, denoting the presence of cp43′, was absent in the pkn <dig> mutant spectrum, we found it in spectra of both the wild type and the wt#pkn22/pete-pkn <dig> strains . this result confirms that the pkn <dig> mutation was actually complemented in the wt#pkn22/pete-pkn <dig> strain. henceforth, compared to the wt strain, we considered those genes displaying a change in expression in the pkn <dig> mutant and not in the wt#pkn22/pete-pkn <dig> strain as being part of the pkn <dig> regulon.fig.  <dig>

we examined the variations in abundance of transcripts in the three nostoc strains after 1 h incubation with 100 μm h2o <dig>  figure  <dig> represents a robust hierarchical clustering of the differentially expressed genes. the transcript levels of  <dig> genes increased with induction factors higher than  <dig> in the pkn <dig> mutant. among them, the transcript level of only  <dig> genes increased in the pkn <dig> mutant and not in the wt#pkn22/pete-pkn <dig> strain. in accordance with the selection criteria explained above, these genes were thus considered as being part of the pkn <dig> regulon . of the proteins encoded by these  <dig> identified genes, nine have unknown function and six are involved in the biosynthesis of prosthetic groups and cofactors. a third group of responsive genes included genes related to phycobilisome components  and a fourth cluster contained the ndhd and ndhf genes encoding respectively the nadh dehydrogenase subunits  <dig> and  <dig>  finally, the mrna level of the translation elongation encoding gene tsf also significantly increased in the pkn <dig> mutant .fig.  <dig> global transcript abundance changes in response to oxidative stress  or to combined nitrogen starvation  represented by a colour-coded heatmap. rnas were extracted from wt strain or the pkn <dig> mutant  or the pkn <dig> mutant harbouring the prl <dig> plasmid expressing the pkn <dig> gene . genes were hierarchically clustered according to their pattern of expression. genes displaying a change in transcript level of at least 2-fold in at least one of the tested strains were represented. values are expressed in log <dig> scale



the transcript level of six genes specifically decreased in the pkn <dig> mutant. one  encodes a cell envelope protein and the other  a transport and binding protein . the four remaining genes encode conserved hypothetical proteins according to the functional classification of cyanobase .

pkn <dig> regulon in response to nitrogen starvation
we next obtained rna samples from wt, pkn <dig> mutant and wt#pkn22/pete-pkn <dig> strains grown in the presence of nitrate or subjected to nitrogen step-down for 24 h. microarray analysis then permitted a global transcription profiling by revealing the clustering of differentially expressed genes . the transcript level of  <dig> genes increased specifically in the pkn <dig> mutant . these genes included those encoding proteins associated with transport and binding , or those required for cell envelope synthesis and cell division, as well as the group  <dig> sigma factor sigd gene and two genes from the two-component regulatory gene family.

of  <dig> genes displaying a decrease in mrna abundance in the pkn <dig> mutant,  <dig> were specifically responsive to the deletion of the pkn <dig> gene . among them were genes involved in translation and transcription processes, the gene encoding phycobilisome core-membrane linker protein apce, and hypc and hypf genes required in the synthesis and maturation of hydrogenase .

to validate the microarray data for selected genes, we performed quantitative reverse transcription assays. the rnas used in these experiments were independent of those used for microarray studies. in particular, we analyzed the expression of  <dig> genes the transcript levels of which varied specifically in the pkn <dig> mutant strain. in response to peroxide stress, the expression of alr <dig>  all <dig> and all <dig> genes was upregulated whereas that of alr <dig>  alr <dig> and all <dig> genes was decreased . combined nitrogen starvation on the other hand led to an upregulation in expression of alr <dig>  alr <dig> and alr <dig> genes. whereas the expression of alr <dig>  all <dig> and all <dig> genes was decreased . all the qrt-pcr reactions presented greater than 80 % efficiency and in all cases results correlated well with the microarray data .table  <dig> validation of the microarray data by quantitative rt-pcr approach for selected representative genes. fold change values are in log2



nitrogen starvation does not generate oxidative stress or a decrease in iron
one hypothesis that could explain the involvement of pkn <dig> in both nitrogen starvation and peroxide stress would be that the metabolic changes occurring after nitrogen step down unbalance the redox homeostasis thereby generating an oxidative stress. however, the transcript abundance of only one gene  being common to the pkn <dig> nitrogen starvation and oxidative stress regulons rather invalidates this hypothesis. moreover, genes encoding proteins required in the defence against oxidative stress and which are highly responsive to peroxide stress  <cit> , were not affected by nitrogen starvation . since iron starvation generates oxidative stress in this bacterium  <cit> , we sought to investigate if combined nitrogen starvation could decrease the iron content of the cell. the intracellular concentration of iron in cultures grown in the presence or absence of nitrate and exposed or not to peroxide was measured as outlined in the methods section. surprisingly, our results clearly show that not only did nitrogen step down not lead to a decrease in the level of intracellular iron , it actually increased it by 10-fold compared to control in the three strains analysed. while an excess of iron can generate oxidative stress via the fenton reaction, this was not expected in the conditions tested here. indeed, the production of reactive oxygen species would cause an increase in the expression of oxidative stress related genes which was not the case . altogether, these data reinforce the notion that, under our experimental conditions, combined nitrogen starvation does not generate an oxidative stress. we therefore conclude that pkn <dig> is required both for the cellular response to oxidative stress and combined nitrogen starvation. it is worth noting that the iron content of the cultures submitted to both nitrogen starvation and peroxide stress was similar to that observed for nitrogen starvation alone, which suggests that the increase of the intracellular iron content is more likely a physiological response specific to combined nitrogen depletion.table  <dig> comparison of the mrna steady state of representative genes in response to peroxide stress and combined nitrogen starvation

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
our analysis of the ser/thr kinase pkn <dig> encoding gene revealed that its transcription is induced in response to oxidative stress generated by h2o <dig> and to combined nitrogen starvation, and it is regulated by the global regulators fura and ntca.

the expression of fura and several iron-responsive genes from nostoc pcc  <dig> is modulated by the master regulator of nitrogen metabolism ntca under combined nitrogen starvation  <cit> . this cross-talk provides a hierarchical regulation which places ntca at the top of the signalling cascade controlling pkn <dig> expression. the mechanism that leads to fura-derepression in response to oxidative stress remains to be elucidated. fura protein has recently been demonstrated to be a redox-sensitive protein  <cit> . we propose that the redox changes that occur under conditions of peroxide stress may affect the redox state of fura, leading to its dissociation from the promoter region of pkn <dig> gene .fig.  <dig> a schematic model summarizing the transcriptional regulation of pkn <dig> gene, and the genes downstream for which the transcript level is under the control of the pkn <dig> kinase. the red and the grey lines show the signalling cascade induced in response to peroxide stress and nitrogen starvation respectively. the dashed lines represent indirect controls. the genes are in boxes and the proteins in circles. the numbers in brackets refer to the number of genes displaying a change in level of expression in the mutant. the genes encoding proteins of unknown function and which are part of the pkn <dig> regulon are not represented in this model. they are listed in additional file 2: table s <dig> and additional file 3: table s3



the transcript profiling analysis of the pkn <dig> mutant grown under either nitrogen starvation or peroxide stress exposure, provided evidence for the kinase playing an important role in the transduction of both signals in nostoc. indeed, the expression of many genes was significantly affected in the mutant, with the absence of the kinase having a stronger impact under combined nitrogen starvation than peroxide stress conditions. indeed, the mrna levels of  <dig> genes changed when the mutant was grown under combined nitrogen starvation versus  <dig> genes when it was submitted to a peroxide stress . under peroxide stress conditions, pkn <dig> regulates genes encoding proteins involved in the uptake of inorganic carbon such as cmpc or subunits of the nadh dehydrogenase complex. pkn <dig> was initially identified as being necessary for the association of cp43′ with the photosynthetic machinery under oxidative stress  <cit> . such modulation of photosynthesis activity upon exposure to a highly oxidative environment is important for survival of photosynthetic organisms and makes pkn <dig> an important element in their cellular response to this stress. in addition, the mrna level of a large number of genes encoding proteins of unknown function varied in both conditions in the pkn <dig> mutant, suggesting an even greater role of this kinase in the signalling process of nostoc than that discussed here.

we recently reported the transcriptomic profiling of nostoc in response to peroxide stress  <cit> . the data published in this study highlighted that the perr repressor as the major regulator of the peroxide stress stimulon. it was found to directly control the transcription of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes, such as peroxidases. it was not surprising therefore to not find such genes in the pkn <dig> regulon. while we know that the signalling cascade of peroxide stress involves more than one regulator  <cit> , what appears now clear is that perr must be at the top of this cascade whereas pkn <dig>  and other transcriptional regulators most probably act downstream of perr.

increasing amounts of data support the existence of an overlap between oxidative stress and nitrogen regulatory networks in cyanobacteria. enzymes involved in the reduction of oxygen or its reactive intermediates have been found produced under limited nitrogen regime in several cyanobacteria. nitrogen limitation led to an increased synthesis of 2-cys peroxiredoxin  in synechococcus pcc  <dig>  <cit> , and the removal of nitrate from the growth medium induced the expression of prx gene encoding  <dig> cys-prx in both synechocystis pcc  <dig> and synechococcus pcc  <dig>  <cit> . it was thus tempting to postulate that combined nitrogen starvation generates oxidative stress which in turn triggers the expression of the pkn <dig> gene. the experiments we performed to analyse this hypothesis, however, revealed that the expression of genes known to be highly induced in response to oxidative stress do not vary under nitrogen starvation . while our results do not allow complete exclusion of the redox state of the cell being unbalanced upon forced adaptation to a new nitrogen regime, they do indicate that these cells were not transducing signals of strong oxidative stress. consequently, pkn <dig> induction in response to nitrogen starvation would appear to be independent of that from peroxide stress stimuli. this kinase can thus be considered as a regulator connecting these two signalling pathways, as suggested in the working model presented in fig.  <dig> 

the challenge faced by future investigations will be to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which pkn <dig> transduces the nitrogen availability and the oxidation level of the cell to its targets. the most intriguing questions left unanswered are which proteins are phosphorylated and where they are situated within the regulatory pathways that have emerged from this study.
