BACKGROUND
hessian fly  is one of the most destructive pests of hexaploid wheat  in the united states and worldwide  <cit> . hessian fly larvae live between leaf-sheaths at seedling stage in fall, inhibit wheat growth irreversibly, and the infested plants lose vigor and die after larvae become pupae. hessian fly larvae also attack stalks in spring, and the attacked plants may break easily before harvest. deployment of natural and genetic resistance in locally adapted wheat cultivars is the most effective, economical, and environmentally safe method to control this devastating insect.

at least  <dig> hessian fly resistance genes have been identified, designated as h <dig> to h <dig> and hdic <cit> . among these hessian fly resistance genes, however, only  <dig> genes  were identified in hexaploid wheat  <cit> . the remaining  <dig> genes were identified in distant and close relatives of hexaploid wheat. there are  <dig> genes  identified in tetraploid wheat species triticum turgidum subsp. durum   <cit> , and  <dig> of them  have been introgressed from tetraploid to hexaploid wheat  <cit> . other genes originating in wild diploid wheat or other relatives and introgressed to hexaploid wheat include six genes  from aegilops tauschii   <cit> , two genes  from secale cerale l.   <cit> , one gene  from aegilops ventricosa , and one gene  from aegilops triuncialis   <cit> . these genes provide important resistance sources but are problematic in variety development programs when they are associated with alien linkage drag.

simple sequence repeat  or microsatellite markers were used to map hessian fly resistance genes in previous studies. seven genes  were mapped on chromosome 1a, and these genes may comprise a cluster  of hessian fly resistance genes in the distal gene-rich region of wheat chromosome 1as  <cit> . the remaining mapped genes include eight genes  on chromosome 5a  <cit> , three genes  on chromosome 3d  <cit> , three genes  on chromosome 2b  <cit> , two genes  on chromosome 6d  <cit> , h <dig> on chromosome 5d  <cit> , h <dig> on chromosome 1d  <cit> , h <dig> on chromosome 6b  <cit> , h <dig> on chromosome 5b  <cit> , and h <dig> on chromosome 4d  <cit> . current understanding of ssr markers is that they can be effectively applied to marker-assisted selection  due to their relative simplicity. however, the ‘repeat’ feature of an ssr marker results in multiple and inconsistent locations of the same marker among divergent wheat cultivars  <cit> . only a gene marker that is developed for the specific functional polymorphism of a gene responsible for a given trait can provide the ultimate resolution needed for selection of the trait  <cit> .

the best strategy to find the regulatory sites of a gene is to clone the gene/qtl. the cloned gene is then used to develop perfect gene markers for use in conventional breeding programs or to manipulate transgenic wheat. to date,  <dig> genes have been cloned from wheat using the positional cloning strategy  <cit> , but no gene has been cloned for resistance to hessian fly. to clone a gene from hexaploid wheat using the map-based cloning approach remains a challenge because of the complexity imparted by three homoeologous genomes, the large genome size , high content of repetitive sequences , and the low polymorphism rate  <cit> . in recent studies, genetic association is also use to identify functional genes for important traits in wheat  <cit> .

recent progress in the application of high-throughput sequencing technologies and development of sophisticated genomic mapping tools has accelerated identification of agriculturally important genes in wheat. numerous wheat ests assigned to wheat deletion bins have facilitated the physical mapping of a gene  <cit> . the availability of genomic sequences from the model species rice  <cit>  and brachypodium distachyon <cit> , and synteny conservation in certain genomic regions between these species and wheat  <cit>  have allowed more precise determination of the physical distance between two markers flanking the target gene by a comparative genomics analysis. newly available wheat genomic sequences, though at low coverage , are useful for designing primers specific to a homoeologous gene for genomic mapping. with the integration of these techniques and tools, mutants of several genes including vrn-a <dig> <cit> , vrn-d <dig> <cit> , ppd-d <dig> <cit> , lr34-d <cit> , yr <dig> <cit> , and pm <dig> <cit>  have been identified in cultivated bread wheat. these genes each were initially mapped under the peak of a qtl for a relevant trait and their mutants were eventually confirmed. in this study, we aimed to determine if any genes known to confer insect resistance in plants are associated with a qtl for resistance in our mapping populations or in a genomic region where a qtl has been reported in published mapping populations.

plants possess multiple defense mechanisms in response to mechanical damage due to insect attack. jasmonic acid  and its conjugates, jasmonates, play a central role in regulating defense responses of plants to insect herbivores  <cit> . in higher plants, ja is synthesized via the octadecanoid pathway consisting of several enzymatic steps. the early steps of this pathway occur in chloroplasts where linolenic acid is converted to 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid  by means of three enzymes, lipoxygenase , allene oxide synthase , and allene oxide cylase  <cit> . opda is subsequently reduced in a cyclopentenone ring by a peroxisome-localized enzyme, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase  <dig> . the reaction product then undergoes three cycles of oxidation in the peroxisome, generating ja  <cit> .

in this study, we mapped  <dig> opr genes and  <dig> lox genes in a population of recombinant inbred lines  that was generated from a cross between two locally adapted winter cultivars, ‘jagger’ and ‘2174’, and showed demonstrable segregation for resistance to hessian fly. the implication in association and disassociation of the qtls for resistance to hessian fly with these opr and lox genes is discussed.

RESULTS
qtls mapped for wheat resistance to hessian fly
jagger was highly susceptible and  <dig> was highly resistant to hessian fly biotype gp when the two parental lines were tested with susceptible  and resistant  cultivars as controls . hence variation in hessian fly resistance between the two parental lines should facilitate mapping the resistance trait based on segregation in the available population of f6: <dig> rils generated by crossing the parental cultivars.

using  <dig> rils of the jagger ×  <dig> population and genome-wide ssr markers  <cit> , we mapped two qtls linked with hessian fly resistance. the first one was a major qtl on the distal end of chromosome 1as  , when the population was infested with the same biotype as the parental lines. qhf.osu-1a was mapped in tight linkage with the powdery mildew gene pm3a previously identified  <cit> . the lod value for qhf.osu-1a was  <dig> , which explained 70% of the total phenotypic variation. phenotypic data showed that those rils which carried the jagger allele had resistance at the level of 6%, whereas those rils that carried the  <dig> allele had resistance at the level of 59%.  <dig> has a resistant allele for both hessian fly and powdery mildew  genes.

the second qtl was a minor qtl on chromosome 2a  . the peak of this qtl was associated with a group of several tightly linked ssr markers and the marker for yr <dig> that was translocated from chromosome 2n of triticum ventricosum  in jagger  <cit> . the lod value for qhf.osu-2a was  <dig>  and this qtl accounted for 18% of the total phenotypic variation. phenotypic data showed that those rils which carried the jagger allele had resistance at the level of  <dig> %, whereas those rils that carried the  <dig> allele had resistance at the level of  <dig> %. the resistant allele at this locus in  <dig> is collinear to an yr17-containing-fragment translocated from chromosome 2n in jagger. jagger attained the translocated chromosome 2n fragment conferring resistance to stripe rust  <cit> . if the translocated fragment in jagger was introgressed into a breeding line or a cultivar such as  <dig>  the novel breeding line could lose approximately 60% of hessian fly resistance conferred by the opr2-a gene on chromosome 2a in  <dig> 

associations of qtls for hessian fly resistance with two opr genes
the peak of qhf.osu-1a was centered with ssr marker xcfa <dig> , which was physically located in a deletion bin of 1as- <dig> , or the distal 14% of the short arm of chromosome 1a  <cit> . wheat est be <dig> encoding an opr protein was also found present in this 1as- <dig> fl  <dig>  deletion bin. it is thus intuitive to hypothesize that this opr gene may be a candidate gene for qhf.osu-1a if it is mapped under the peak of this qtl. the be <dig> sequence was used to blast against the wheat genomic dna databases , and the wheat sequences retrieved from the databases were grouped based on sequence alignments of the homoeologous and paralogous opr genes. primers were designed for each group of these genes and tested for specificity to n1at1d, n1bt1d, and n1dt1b of ‘chinese spring’  nullisomic–tetrasomic  lines  <cit> . primers oprc1-abd-f <dig> and oprc1-r <dig> for one of the opr genes were identified specific to chromosome 1a .

a pcr marker, using primers oprc1-abd-f <dig> and oprc1-r <dig>  was developed for the opr gene taopr1-a, the first opr gene to be mapped on chromosome 1a of t. aestivum. the primers amplified a 337-bp fragment that was digested with kpni into  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp for the jagger allele  and into  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp, and  <dig> bp for the  <dig> allele  . taopr1-a was mapped under the peak of qhf.osu-1a and  <dig>  cm in genetic distance to xcfa <dig>  in the ril population of jagger ×  <dig> 

the second opr gene, taopr2-a, which showed 79% identity  to taopr1-a within a range of  <dig> bp , showed complete linkage with a group of markers for yr <dig> translocated from chromosome 2n and under the peak of qhf.osu-2a. the wheat est be <dig> that was mapped in 1as- <dig> fl  <dig>  deletion bin was used to blast against genbank nucleotide collection  databases, and it showed 82% identity within a range of  <dig> bp  to an orthologous opr gene in rice bac from chromosome  <dig> . specific primers were designed based on the grouped sequences retrieved from the wheat genomic dna databases. the primers opr22-c1-f <dig> and opr-r <dig> amplified a  <dig> bp fragment that was digested with hincii into  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp for the jagger allele  and into  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp, and  <dig> bp for the  <dig> allele  .

disassociations of opr and lox genes with mapped qtls for hessian fly resistance
in addition to the mapped associations of taopr1-a and taopr2-a with the two qtls for hessian fly resistance, another opr gene taopr7-b was linked with xbarc <dig> on chromosome 7b . initially, an opr gene present in rice bac  was analyzed and used to search for the wheat orthologous opr genes, because the rice bac could be in a collinear region to wheat chromosome 1a. specific forward primer opr1-c1f <dig> was used to combine with conserved reverse primer opr-r <dig> to amplify a single copy of the opr gene mapped on chromosome 7b . the chromosomal location of taopr7-b was confirmed by using cs nullisomic-tetrasomic lines . the primers opr-c1f <dig> and opr-c1r <dig> amplified a  <dig> bp fragment that was digested with ddei for the  <dig> allele into  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp but was not digested for the jagger allele  .

three lox genes were mapped in this study. initially, a wheat est  that was mapped in the 1as- <dig> fl  <dig>  deletion bin was used to blast against wheat gdna databases  and genbank est databases for the homoeologous and paralogous lox genes. this wheat est was expected to reside in a region collinear with rice chromosome  <dig> <cit> . it showed 86% identity within a range of only  <dig> bp  to an orthologous gene in rice bac from chromosome  <dig> , but it was more likely orthologous to other lox genes in rice, with 87% identity in a range of only  <dig> bp  to one in chromosome  <dig> , with 72% identity  to two genes on chromosome  <dig> . homoeologous chromosomes of hexaploid wheat could have three genes for each orthologous gene in rice. primers were designed specifically to each of the groups retrieved from the sequences by bf <dig> 

the first lox gene was mapped using primers lox-c5-f <dig> and lox-c5-r <dig> specific to chromosome 1a . the primers amplified a fragment of approximately  <dig>  bp that was digested with scrfi into several fragments, distinguishable by an extra fragment of approximately  <dig> bp for the  <dig> allele  compared with the jagger allele  . this lox gene was mapped on chromosome 1a  but outside of the qhf.osu-1a region .

the second lox gene was mapped using primers lox0-f <dig> and lox0-r <dig> that amplified a common band in both jagger and  <dig> and an additional lower band in jagger . pcr products from jagger were purified from the agarose gel, and direct sequence analysis showed that it was part of a lox gene . the high quality sequence result indicated that it was from a pseudo gene in jagger . the dominant marker for the lox gene in jagger was mapped with a linkage group of ssr markers on chromosome 2b , and this gene was thus designed talox2-b.

the third lox gene was mapped using primers lox-f <dig> and lox-r <dig> that amplified pcr products of polymorphic size with approximately  <dig> bp in jagger  and  <dig> bp in  <dig> . the sequencing results confirmed that these pcr products were derived from part of a lox gene, with an  <dig> bp deletion for the jagger allele or an  <dig> bp insertion for the  <dig> allele . this lox gene was mapped with a linkage group of ssr markers on chromosome 6b , and this gene was thus designed talox6-b.

fine collinearity at the qhf.osu-1a locus between wheat, rice and brachypodium
taopr1-a was used to screen the t. durum bac library, and one positive clone  was sequenced with low coverage to find genes that could be used to determine collinear regions of rice and brachypodium. four opr genes , and three genes encoding stress-induced receptor-like kinase  , catalytic domain of protein kinases  , and calcineurin-like phosphoesterase-like   respectively, were present in the wheat bac clone . allelic variation was observed in the srk gene for the jagger allele  and the  <dig> allele , the clp gene for the jagger allele  and the  <dig> allele , and the pkc gene for the jagger allele  and the  <dig> allele . howerver, no crossover was found between the opr genes and these linked genes in the the qhf.osu-1a region.

taopr1-a displayed the highest identity to orthologous opr genes in a rice bac from chromosome  <dig> , which contains  <dig> opr genes arranged in tandem . except for the wheat opr genes, however, the other wheat genes  were not present in the flanking regions of the opr genes in the two bac clones shown in figure 6a or in other bac clones containing oprs in rice. taopr1-a displayed the highest identity to three orthologous opr genes in brachypodium , but again, except for the wheat opr genes and srk gene, the other wheat genes  were not observed in the collinear region of brachypodium. the orthologous genes in brachypodium were not present in the flanking regions of the opr genes in rice either.

discussion
a resistance gene against hessian fly has been repeatedly mapped to the end of the short arm of chromosome 1a in previous studies, and it was suggested that this genomic region contained a cluster of major dominant resistance genes against multiple hessian fly biotypes, including h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  and hdic <cit> . however, all of the previous studies were performed in the tetraploid wheat t. durum. our study is the first report that a resistance gene against hessian fly exists in the short arm of chromosome 1a in bread wheat. the resistance gene at the qhf.osu-1a locus observed in hexaploid wheat cv.  <dig> could be orthologous to one or more of the previously mapped resistance genes in tetraploid wheat. this study provides an effective resistance source to manage biotype gp that frequently damage bread wheat cultivars in the southern great plains. further studies need to test if the qhf.osu-1a gene is allelic to genes h <dig> and h <dig> that confer resistance against hessian fly biotype l, the most virulent and prevalent biotype in the eastern usa  <cit> . the resistance gene at qhf.osu-1a in  <dig> and its derived cultivars can be immediately utilized to control hessian fly biotype gp in winter wheat improvement programs in the southern great plains in usa. the gene may also be useful for pyramiding to prolong the effective periods of other resistance genes.

mapping of qhf.osu-1a showed that it is closely linked with pm3a. previous studies indicated that pm <dig> was linked to h <dig> at a genetic distance of  <dig>  cm  <cit> . several alleles have been characterized for the pm <dig> gene  <cit> . leaf rust resistance gene lr <dig>  which has three paralogous genes and is effective against puccinia triticina eriks, was also mapped in the same chromosomal region on 1as  <cit> . the presence of a resistance gene cluster in the gene-rich distal region of 1as in bread wheat has made it difficult to determine which gene is the candidate for qhf.osu-1a. an effort was made to construct a fine physical map for qhf.osu-1a. however, low collinearity of the gene order in this region among wheat, rice, or brachypodium indicates that the fine physical map for qhf.osu-1a cannot be established by using genome information from rice or brachypodium only. the recent sequencing of wheat genomes may provide a powerful tool in cloning qhf.osu-1a.

two opr genes were identified in association with two qtls for resistance against hessian fly, but we cannot yet decisively conclude if either of the candidate opr genes is responsible for qhf.osu-1a. the two qtls were discovered in the same population, and resistance to hessian fly is inseparable between the two qtls. two specific ril lines  have been selected to backcross with the  <dig> parental line to generate progeny that will segregate for a single hessian fly gene. in these backcross populations, qhf.osu-1a will occur in the heterozygous state, whereas qhf.osu-2a will be fixed in a homozygous genetic background. we expect that the two alleles of qhf.osu-1a will produce clear segregation for resistance to hessian fly. bc1f2- <dig> populations will be used also to determine degree of dominance for the hessian fly gene.

talox6-b was mapped between xwmc <dig> and xbarc <dig> toward the centromere of wheat chromosome 6b. it was reported that h <dig> was translocated from rye to the long arm of chromosome 6b of wheat  <cit> , and thus, talox6-b is not allelic to h <dig>  talox2-b is located between xwms <dig> and xwms <dig> on the long arm of chromosome 2b. h <dig> was transferred from t. durum to chromosome 2b, and h <dig> was translocated from rye to chromosome 2b in wheat. however, more information is needed to further clarify any allelic relationship of talox6-b with either h <dig> or h <dig>  a recent study indicates that a novel wheat gene encoding a lectin-like protein  was associated with response to hessian fly  <cit> . the homoeologous hfr- <dig> genes are located on group  <dig> chromosomes of the hexaploid wheat. yet, no hessian fly resistance gene was reported on chromosome 7b where taopr7-b was mapped.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, a frequent objective of wheat breeding is to pyramid multiple genes for resistance to diseases and insects into a single cultivar. compared with  <dig>  jagger attained a translocated fragment that contains lr <dig>  yr <dig> and sr <dig> conferring resistance to leaf rust, stripe rust, and stem rust, but jagger lost the allelic region containing the resistance gene on qhf.osu-2a against hessian fly. the molecular marker can greatly facilitate the identification of such a candidate gene for the qhf.osu-1a locus, enabling opportunities for functional analysis which can then be used to better understand the defense mechanisms of wheat plants in response to this major insect.
