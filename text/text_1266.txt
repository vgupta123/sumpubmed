BACKGROUND
riemerella anatipestifer  is a gram-negative bacterium in the family flavobacteriaceae and rrna superfamily v  <cit> . r. anatipestifer can infect ducks, geese, turkeys, chickens, and other birds, and leads to a contagious septicemia  <cit> . transmission between ducks occurs vertically  as well as horizontally via the respiratory tract  <cit> . r. anatipestifer has a worldwide distribution and is one of the leading problems of the farmed duck industry, mainly infecting young ducks with a mortality of up to 90%. animals that survive infection may be stunted  <cit> , leading to decreased production. riemerellosis causes substantial economic losses in countries with significant duck industries, such as china and southeastern asia  <cit> . while serotyping is the traditional method to differentiate r. anatipestifer isolates  <cit> , other methods, including pcr based on 16s rrna or rpob genes  <cit> , repetitive-sequence polymerase chain reaction   <cit> , multiplex pcr  <cit> , matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight  mass spectrometry  <cit> , plasmid profiling, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , and pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism   <cit>  have also been used to characterize isolates.

at least  <dig> serotypes have been described in different countries  <cit>  with no cross-protection between different serotypes. among pathogenic isolates, serotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are the most common  <cit> . individual animals can be infected with multiple serotypes and changes in the predominant serotype from year to year within a single farm have been described  <cit> .

although reimerellosis causes serious economic losses, the pathogenesis of r. anatipestifer and the virulence factors remain mostly unknown. subramaniam et al. identified ompa as a predominant immunogenic outer membrane protein  <cit> . later, it was shown that ompa mutant strains were attenuated when used to infect ducklings, with decreased adhesion and invasion capacities in vero cells, indicating that ompa is a virulence factor  <cit> . recently, zhai et al. selected six proteins that cross-reacted with serotypes  <dig> and  <dig> for a vaccine trial. only administration of the recombinant outer membrane protein a  showed a protective effect when challenged by serotype  <dig>  and serotype  <dig>   <cit> . additionally, vapd was identified as a virulence factor, with homology to virulence-associated proteins of other bacteria  <cit> . camp cohemolysin was identified as another potential virulence factor, which may lyse red blood cells and release iron for use by the organism  <cit> .

the publication of the first r. anatipestifer genome, atcc <dig>  <cit>  has improved the understanding of the disease mechanisms underlying infection. however, the relatively limited number of published strains has hindered more in-depth analysis. in order to establish genetic differences between pathogenic strains, we sequenced two r. anatipestifer genomes, ra-ch- <dig> and ra-ch- <dig>  which were isolated from sick ducks from chengdu and mianyang, respectively, in the sichuan province of china, and compared these to the two previously sequenced strains, atcc <dig> and ra-gd .

RESULTS
general features of the r. anatipestifergenomes
genomic read-data for the two r. anatipestifer strains sequenced in this study were generated using a multiplexing approach in a single illumina hiseq lane. the resulting sequences were assembled using soapdenovo. the previously sequenced atcc <dig> has single  <dig> ,087 bp circular chromosome with  <dig> % gc content. in contrast, ra-ch- <dig> is larger at  <dig> ,519 bp with  <dig> % gc content while ra-ch- <dig> is similar at  <dig> ,321 bp with  <dig> % gc content. atcc <dig>  ra-ch- <dig> and ra-ch- <dig> contain  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   genes, respectively. all genomes have approximately the same codon usage frequency.

genes associated with iron/hemin metabolism
bacteria that reside in animal tissues must acquire iron from their host for growth. a large number of genes coding for iron and hemin metabolism and iron-dependent transcriptional regulators were annotated in all sequenced strains. a total of one siderophore-interacting protein  and three siderophore receptors were detected that could be involved in fe3+ uptake. the siderophore-interacting protein was previously found to be involved in iron utilization and mutation of this gene significantly decreased virulence in r. anatipestifer ch- <dig>  <cit> . there were two putative proteins, feoa and feob, for fe2+ uptake and two outer membrane hemin receptors. all sequenced strains had one extracellular hemin-binding protein , and no hemin degrading proteins were detected via sequence analysis, suggesting that r. anatipestifer may have a novel hemin degrading system. additionally, we found that several tonb-dependent receptors with a plug domain, one set of the exbb-exbd-tonb complex, one set of the exbb-exbd-exbd-tonb complex, and one tonb family protein. the tonb-dependent receptor tbdr <dig>  has been found to be involved in heme acquisition in r. anatipestifer. the median lethal dose of a tbdr <dig> mutant was approximately 45-fold higher than the wild-type ch- <dig> strain  <cit> . our group has confirmed the functions of tonb and the tonb complex and determined that the exbb-exbd-tonb complex is involved in heme uptake in atcc <dig> .

r. anatipestifer is usually grown on blood-enriched media. sequence analysis shows that r. anatipestifer does not encode for genes involved in heme synthesis, hemf, y, and g . this suggests that the heme compounds from the culture plate could be essential for growth. we have determined that r. anatipestifer can synthesize hemin using protoporphyrin as a substrate and subsequently use hemin as an iron source . however, the function of proteins involved in iron/hemin metabolism in maintaining and enhancing virulence still requires experimental investigation.

genes associated with gliding motility
cells of the phylum bacteroidetes can rapidly move over surfaces using a process called gliding motility. in f. johnsoniae, at least nineteen genes  involved in gliding motility have been identified . these motility proteins constitute a novel protein secretion system, the por secretion system   <cit> , which may be an integral part of the gliding motility machinery  <cit> . in f. johnsoniae, the por secretion system consists of gldk, gldl, gldm, gldn, spra, spre, and sprt, which are needed for secretion of an extracellular chitinase  <cit> . similarly, the p. gingivalis porss is needed for secretion of gingipain protease virulence factors  <cit> .

genome analysis finds that r. anatipestifer encodes for several genes involved in gliding motility, including glda, gldb, gldc, gldd, gldf, gldh, gldj, gldk, gldl, gldm, gldn, porp, and port. many of the proteins encoded by these genes are predicted to localize to the cellular envelope. in f. johnsoniae, gldk, gldl, gldm, and gldn are clustered together on in two adjacent operons, although gldk is transcribed separately from the other three genes  <cit> . a similar arrangement is found in r. anatipestifer as well as other bacteroidetes, such as f. psychrophilum and c. hutchinsonii
 <cit> . this organization suggests that the protein products of these genes work together as a part of a complex, and the extensive conservation of the genes encoding this protein secretion system indicates it is likely functional in r. anatipestifer. analysis of this system in r. anatipestifer has the potential to provide insight into disease pathogenesis. for example, in p. gingivalis, the porss is involved in gliding motility and pathogenesis  <cit> . the porss, its relationship to gliding, and its function in pathogenesis, needs to be further studied in r. anatipestifer.

complete genome analysis and structural variation
the genomes of ra-ch- <dig> and ra-gd were similar to the genome of atcc <dig>  while the genome of ra-ch- <dig> is significantly different. all four strains had some deletions unique to a specific strain. the missing parts of the ra-ch- <dig> and ra-gd genomes were focused in three different places as shown in the colinearity analysis . however, deleted sequences of ra-ch- <dig> were dispersed throughout the genome . moreover, there were more genome rearrangements between ra-ch- <dig> and atcc <dig> than the other two genomes. by analyzing the genomic coverage rate and sequence similarity of homologous regions for the four different genomes, we found that there is a higher degree of similarity between atcc <dig> and both ra-ch- <dig> and ra-gd than ra-ch- <dig> . compared to the genome of atcc <dig>  ra-ch- <dig> had a higher snp and indel density than ra-ch- <dig> and ra-gd. the distribution of snps and indels for ra-ch- <dig> and ra-gd are similar . furthermore, we found that the genomes of ra-ch- <dig> and ra-ch- <dig> had commons deletions compared to atcc <dig> and ra-gd . both ra-ch- <dig> and ra-ch- <dig> contain same inserted and deleted sequences, which suggests these deletions are localized to the region both these strains were isolated from.figure  <dig>

functional analysis of variant genes
based on analysis of mutation types, we found that indels mainly induced non-synonymous mutations, while snp primarily caused synonymous mutations. there were significantly more snps than indels . in addition, we analyzed three different types of genes using cog  <cit> , kegg  <cit> , pathway  <cit> , and go functional characterization databases  <cit>  . first were genes that were found by pairing with sequences from other strains, but were not annotated because of a mutation in the original sequence. second were structural variations  region genes. third were genes containing snps or small indels. among these three groups, the first have no significant difference in the three databases, indicating that there is no increased rates of change in any particular functional gene category or pathway.figure  <dig> 
variations due to snps and indels. the number of snps is in red, and the number of indels in blue. unshift: the mutation does not cause a frame change , outside_frame: the variation occurred outside the coding frame, unknow_codon: unrecognized variant codon, same_codon: the codon was unchanged by the mutation, start_nonsyn: non-synonymous mutations at start codon; stop_nonsyn: non-synonymous mutations at stop codon; start_syn: synonymous mutations at start codon; stop_syn: synonymous mutations at stop codon, total_mutate: the total number of various variants.

through cog analysis, we can find that the sv region sequences of ra-ch- <dig>  ra-ch- <dig>  ra-gd have no significant differences in polymorphism frequencies. ra-ch- <dig> had  <dig> areas with significantly higher rates of snps and indels, ra-ch- <dig> showed no significant differences, and ra-gd had significantly higher snp and indel rates in the cog “m: cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis”, which may be associated with host invasion or antibiotic resistance. snps are the main type of polymorphism, indicating that r. anatipestifer evolution mainly relies on this rather than deletion or insertion to generate genetic diversity.

gene family cluster analysis
a gene family is a set of several similar genes formed by duplication of a single original gene, generally with similar biochemical functions  <cit> . members of the same gene family can be closely arranged, forming a gene cluster, or can be scattered throughout the chromosome, with different patterns of expression and regulation. gene families play an important role in the evolution and functional analysis of different species  <cit> . for r. anatipestifer, most of the high copy number gene families were annotated as hypothetical genes, with ra-ch- <dig> having a higher copy number compared to the other strains . the number of gene families in different strains reflected phenotypic differences. copy numbers of core gene families may be related to quantitative traits, while non-core gene families may be associated with strain-specific traits. ra-ch- <dig> had four non-core gene families with higher copy numbers, but these were not detected using the kegg or cog databases. multi-copy gene family analysis showed that the four strains analyzed had only six multi-copy gene families, with ra-ch- <dig> family members having higher copy numbers. overall, ra-ch- <dig> had the most unique family members , while the other three strains had only 1– <dig> unique gene families per strain . ra-ch- <dig> had  <dig> unique genes, while each of the other three strains had approximately  <dig> unique genes each. this complexity could reflect the differing biological characteristics of r. anatipestifer strains.figure  <dig>

phylogenetic analysis
we constructed two phylogenetic trees of the four r. anatipestifer strains using conservative and non-conservative elements. the topological structures of the conservative and non-conservative trees are similar, but with different branch lengths . phylogenetic analysis determined that ra-ch- <dig> and ra-ch- <dig> belong to the same branch, but the relationship of their ancestor node with the atcc <dig> and ra-gd strains was unclear . ra-ch- <dig> and ra-ch- <dig> appear closely related to atcc <dig>  but are on different branches compared to ra-gd . additionally, structural analysis demonstrated that some conserved components were not in annotated cdss. most of the conserved components were in conserved regions and non-conserved regions had eight times the polymorphism rate of conserved regions . when compared to other flavobacteria, the four r. anatipestifer strains and r. columbina cluster in one group, while other flavobacterium belong to another group .figure  <dig>

riemerella. the phylogenetic trees were constructed using orthologous gene coding sequences, phase  <dig> site, and four-fold degenerate sites, respectively. as the relationship of the ancestor node of ra-ch- <dig> and ra-ch- <dig> with atcc <dig> and ra-gd was not clear, the phylogenetic trees were constructed using conserved  and non-conserved  elements.

CONCLUSIONS
we successfully isolated two r. anatipestifer strains, ra-ch- <dig> and ra-ch- <dig>  from chengdu and mianyang, respectively, in the sichuan province of china, and completed their genome sequences. using a mixture of comparative genomics strategies, we completed a comprehensive analysis of four r. anatipestifer strains: ra-ch- <dig>  ra-ch- <dig>  atcc <dig>  and ra-gd, to identify factors involved in pathogenesis. our findings will form the foundation of future investigations into the pathogenesis of r. anatipestifer.
