BACKGROUND
the plant root system is composed of primary roots, lateral roots, and adventitious roots. adventitious roots refer to roots that form from any non-root tissue. these roots can generates from the tissues of old roots, stems or leaves during normal development to replenish and strengthen the roles of primary roots and in response to stresses  <cit> . the formation of adventitious roots is an important technique for commercial propagation of homogeneous horticultural plants and forest trees  <cit> . in addition, the process of adventitious root formation provides an ideal experimental system with which to study the important physiological and molecular events that occur during the tissue dedifferentiation and morphogenesis  <cit> . many exogenous and endogenous factors that play important roles in adventitious rooting have been extensively studied using physiological and molecular methods. auxin is known to play a critical role in inducing cell dedifferentiation and root primordia formation in cuttings. other molecules, such as hydrogen peroxide  and nitric oxide  that produced by cells in response to various stresses, also act as signalling molecules that are involved in modulating of the induction and initiation of adventitious root formation  <cit> . h2o <dig> and no are considered as key components of the molecular control of adventitious root formation in cuttings responding to wounding and auxin  <cit> . li et al. reported that exogenous application of h2o <dig> promoted adventitious rooting in mung bean and cucumber hypocotyl cuttings and that h2o <dig> acts as a downstream signalling molecule in auxin-induced adventitious rooting  <cit> . yang demonstrated that h2o <dig> acts as a downstream modulator in sa-triggered adventitious root formation in mung bean seedlings  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms by which h2o <dig> promotes adventitious root development remain elusive.

h2o <dig> has been well known to act as a key signalling molecule that mediates a wide range of physiological processes  <cit> , including senescence  <cit> , photorespiration and photosynthesis  <cit> , stomatal movement  <cit> , cell cycle  <cit> , seed germination  <cit> , programmed cell death   <cit> , growth and development  <cit> , as well as coordination of responses to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . a number of studies have demonstrated that pre-treatment with an appropriate level of h2o <dig>  now known as h2o <dig> priming, can enhance tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses through the modulation of multiple physiological processes and stress-responsive pathways  <cit> . h2o <dig> pre-treatment induces increases in reactive oxygen species  scavenging enzyme activities and modulates the expression of genes involved in ros control; signal transduction; transcriptional regulation; and protein, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism  <cit> . for example, exogenously applied h2o <dig> increased the expression of genes encoding ros scavenging proteins, such as genes gpx  and gst   <cit> ; sod   <cit> ; gpx <dig>   <cit> ; cat <dig>  cat <dig> and cat <dig>   <cit> ; gst <dig>  <cit> ; apx   <cit> ; gr   <cit> ; and aox1a   <cit> , as well as genes encoding proteins required for peroxisome biogenesis  <cit> . another study demonstrated that h2o <dig> induced the expression of genes encoding proteins related to plant signalling and development, cell elongation and division, and cell cycle control, including 14-3-3-like protein, profiling  <dig>  proteasome-alpha-type- <dig>  translationally controlled tumour protein homolog, and benzoquinone reductase, but reduced the expression of genes encoding lectin, albumin- <dig>  aba-responsive protein abr <dig>  and cell-autonomous heat shock cognate protein  <dig>  <cit> . h2o <dig> also increased the expression of genes encoding pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase, sucrose- phosphate synthase, and small heat shock proteins  <cit> . furthermore, exogenous h2o <dig> has been shown to be involved in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascade pathways  <cit> . h2o <dig> strongly activates mapk <dig>  mapk <dig>  <cit> , mpk1/ <dig>  <cit> , mpk <dig>  and nucleotide diphosphate kinase  <dig> , which specifically interacts with mpk <dig> and mpk <dig>  thereby regulating the cellular redox state  <cit> . however, little molecular information is available regarding h2o2-induced adventitious root development.

in our previous studies, we reported that exogenous h2o <dig> strongly promoted adventitious rooting in mung bean hypocotyl cuttings  <cit> . recently, we characterized the mung bean transcriptome and gene expression profiles during the induction and initiation stages of adventitious rooting in water-treated  <cit>  or iba-treated  <cit>  mung bean hypocotyl cuttings using rna-seq technology. in the present study, rna-seq technology and qrt-pcr were exploited to reveal the transcriptome of h2o <dig> promotion adventitious rooting in mung bean hypocotyl cuttings. our main objective of the present study was to analyse the gene profiles and metabolic pathways that specifically responded to exogenous h2o <dig> treatment and further to uncover the molecular basis of h2o <dig> priming and promotion of adventitious rooting in plants.

RESULTS
rna sequencing, reads mapping, de novo assembly, unigene determination, and gene expression abundance analysis
in this experiment, the hypocotyl tissues that were treated with 10 mm h2o <dig> for 6 h or 24 h, designated as ho <dig> and ho <dig>  which represent the induction stage and initiation stage of adventitious root development in mung bean seedlings, respectively  <cit> , were separately sampled for total rna extraction, cdna library construction, and illumina solexa rna paired-end sequencing. the sequencing data and mapping results are listed in table  <dig>  this sequencing generated approximately 93% of the high-quality reads from the samples, and approximately 93% of the quality reads mapped uniquely to the reference sequences that were constructed in our previous study  <cit> . using the chrysalis cluster module of trinity, we identified a total of  <dig>  unigenes from all the samples  <cit> . the sequencing data were used for bioinformatics analysis with the data from the same batch samples treated with water for 6 h  or 24 h  that were reported in our previous study  <cit> . data analysis showed that the number of clean reads and expressed genes were increased by  <dig> % in ho <dig> and  <dig> % in ho <dig> and by  <dig> %  in ho <dig> and  <dig> %  in ho <dig> compared with wat <dig> and wat <dig>  respectively  <cit> ; and the expressed gene number were increased by  <dig> % and  <dig> % compared with 6- and 24-h iba treatments, respectively  <cit> . this result indicates that h2o <dig> treatment greatly increased the number of expressed genes during two time points in comparison to the water and iba treatments, particularly in the sample treated for 6 h. cluster analysis of the samples showed that the ho <dig> and ho <dig> treatments separately grouped with wat <dig> and wat <dig>  suggesting that the changes in gene expression abundance mainly depended on the time duration rather than the treatments during adventitious rooting in mung bean seedlings . furthermore, gene expression abundance was increased in ho <dig> and ho <dig> relative to wat <dig> and wat <dig> .table  <dig> data obtained from rna-seq

functional enrichment analysis of the genes expressed during h2o2-induced adventitious rooting
the functional enrichment results of the unigenes from the clusters of orthologous groups for eukaryotic complete genomes  database were clustered using blast2go software  <cit>  and wego software  <cit>  and designated as go terms. the differentially expressed unigenes with 2-fold changes  between the samples under each go category were further filtered. the statistical analysis results are listed in additional file  <dig> and table  <dig>  table  <dig> shows that the total number of gos enriched in ho <dig> is  <dig> % higher than that in ho <dig> and that there are  <dig> % and  <dig> % more up- and down-regulated gos in ho <dig> than in ho <dig>  respectively, indicating that a profound change in gene function occurred during the 6-h h2o <dig> treatment . there are  <dig> % more up-regulated gos than down-regulated gos in ho <dig> and  <dig> % more down-regulated gos than up-regulated gos in ho <dig>  suggesting that h2o <dig> mainly enhanced gene expression levels at the 6-h time point but reduced gene levels at the 24-h time point.table  <dig> changes in the go categories and ko pathways in the sample groups




we further analysed the ratio of differentially expressed genes  in each up- and down-regulated go category . in the up-regulated go group, nearly all of the deg ratios in ho <dig> were greater than those in ho <dig>  while the opposite result was observed in the down-regulated go group, suggesting that most of the degs were significantly up-regulated by the 6-h h2o <dig> treatment. the deg ratios under the go terms extracellular region and extracellular region part in cellular component, as well as electron carrier activity, antioxidant activity, enzyme regulator activity, and nutrient reservoir activity in molecular function were strongly increased from ho <dig> to ho <dig> in the up-regulated go group, suggesting the degs in these go terms were significantly up-regulated from 6 h to 24 h of treatment. in the down-regulated go group, deg ratios under the go terms cell killing in biological process and extracellular region part in cellular component were significantly increased in ho <dig>  while deg ratios under the go terms antioxidant activity, structural molecule activity, and nutrient reservoir activity in molecular function were significantly increased in ho <dig>  suggesting that the degs in these go terms were down-regulated by h2o <dig> treatment for 6 h and 24 h, respectively.

the most significantly up- and down-regulated gos that specifically responded to h2o <dig> treatment are listed in additional file  <dig> and table  <dig>  in summary, h2o <dig> treatment for 6 h significantly up-regulated the gos associated with the functions cellular component movement, transcription, dna synthesis, cell cycle, hydrolase activity, and response to stress and down-regulated the gos associated with oxidoreductase, cellular respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, and lipid transport. h2o <dig> treatment for 24 h significantly up-regulated the gos associated with oxidoreductase activity, transcription, isoflavonoid biosynthetic process, and ethylene biosynthetic process and down-regulated the gos related to protein synthesis, cellular biosynthetic process, and cell wall organization. interestingly, 6- and 24-h iba treatment mainly up-regulated the gos associated with auxin signalling, ribosome assembly and protein synthesis, and nucleolus  <cit> ; whereas, h2o <dig> mainly up-regulated cellular component movement, transcription, and response to stress. with respect to the down-regulated gos, the same were detected in both iba and h2o <dig> treated samples, such as extracellular region, oxidoreductase activity, ribosome, except photosynthesis. furthermore, cell wall loosening was up-regulated while cell wall organization was down-regulated in both iba and h2o <dig> treated samples.table  <dig> summary of the top differentially regulated gos in the sample groups

21 kda protein, which has pectinesterase inhibitor domain, and expansin-like b <dig> are implicated in the regulation of cell wall extension  <cit> . the above results indicate that, in comparison with 6-h treatment, a large number of genes were greatly up-regulated by 24-h h2o <dig> treatment. these genes are mainly associated with stress response, redox homeostasis, cell wall loosening and remodeling, auxin signalling pathway, ethylene and gibberellin signalling pathways, protein and lipid degradation, and cell differentiation and elongation. notably, the genes coding for endoglucanase 17-like, expansin-like b1-like, mate efflux family protein frd3-like, and pectinesterase 2-like were highly up-regulated 2193-, 544-, 526-, and 182-fold, respectively, in ho <dig> vs. ho <dig>  suggesting that cell wall loosening and remodeling and stress response were the profound molecular processes modulated by h2o <dig> from 6- to 24-h.

six genes were down-regulated 8- to 134-fold in both ho <dig> vs. wat <dig> and ho <dig> vs. ho <dig>  including a cationic peroxidase 1-like, a germin-like protein subfamily  <dig> member 7-like, a cprd <dig> , a 2-oxoglutarate/fe-dependent dioxygenase-like, a casparian strip membrane protein  <dig>  a protease inhibitor, and a lipoxygenase gene . the 2-oxoglutarate/fe-dependent dioxygenase belong to dioxygenase domain enzymes that is involved in the formation of plant hormones, such as ethylene, gibberellins, anthocyanidins and pigments such as flavones  <cit> . lipoxygenases  were involved in growth, development and oxidative stress  <cit>  and were up-regulated in tissue cultures for adventitious rooting  <cit> . loxs oxidize linolenic acid present in membranes, resulting in the lipoperoxidation of membranes  <cit> . the down-regulation of this gene may alleviate the lipoperoxidation of membranes. casparian strip membrane proteins  have recently been shown to form membrane scaffolds and direct the local modification of the cell wall in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> .

genes involved in plant hormone signalling were significantly regulated during h2o2-induced adventitious rooting
plant hormones are known to play vital roles in adventitious rooting; however, we do not known whether h2o <dig> promotes adventitious rooting by regulating the expression of plant hormone signalling-related genes. thus, these genes were searched among all degs, and a total of  <dig> genes with both fold change >  <dig> and rpkm ≥  <dig> were identified, including  <dig> abc transport family members,  <dig> auxin pathway genes,  <dig> ethylene pathway genes, six cytokinin pathway genes, ten gibberellin-related genes, and three abscisic acid-related genes .table  <dig> plant hormone-related genes that were differentially regulated by h2o <dig> treatment




eight and three genes of atp-binding cassette  transporter family members were up-regulated at 6 h and 24 h time points, respectively, but eight genes were down-regulated from 6 h to 24 h, suggesting that h2o <dig> increased the expression of abc transport family genes. abc transporters have been known to participate in the export or import of a wide variety of molecules for growth and development under abiotic stress  <cit>  and to act as an auxin carrier complex in cellular auxin efflux and influx  <cit> .

in the group of auxin-related genes, a total of  <dig> genes were identified, including  <dig> auxin-induced proteins, ten auxin response proteins , nine indole-3-acetic acid -amido synthetase gh3s, seven auxin response factor , four auxin transporter-like protein , an auxin efflux carrier , and an auxin-binding protein abp19a  gene . of the auxin-induced protein genes,  <dig> auxin-induced protein 5ng4-like genes were up-regulated at 6 h but down-regulated at 24 h and from 6 h to 24 h. among these genes, two auxin-induced protein pcnt115-like genes were highly up-regulated. the auxin-induced protein 5ng4-like proteins belong to the plant drug/metabolite exporter  family that consists of a group of plant wat <dig> -related proteins, which has been shown to be involved in secondary cell wall deposition  <cit> . the aux/iaas were down-regulated at 6 h and from 6 h to 24 h. the arfs were up-regulated at 6 h and 24 h but down-regulated from 6 h to 24 h. the iaa-amido synthetase gh <dig> genes were down-regulated at 6 h but up-regulated at 24 h and from 6 h to 24 h. pin <dig> and lax <dig> were up-regulated 6- to 20-fold from 6 h to 24 h. abp was up-regulated 136-fold from 6 h to 24 h. the auxin-inducible aux/iaa family proteins function as repressors of early auxin response genes at low auxin concentrations  <cit> . gh3s catalyse the synthesis of iaa-amino acid conjugates, providing a mechanism for the plant to cope with the presence of excess auxin  <cit> . pin <dig> and lax <dig> are involved in proton-driven auxin influx and mediate auxin gradient formation  <cit> . the abp is probably an additional auxin receptor that mediates rapid cellular auxin effects through a non-transcriptional auxin response pathway  <cit> . these results suggest that h2o <dig> increased the expression of auxin transporter and receptor genes and down-regulated arfs and aux/iaas from 6 h to 24 h after the treatment, resulting in the initiation of auxin signalling during h2o2-promoted adventitious rooting. this modulation mechanism of auxin signalling is similar to the iba-induced process  <cit>  and was reported during adventitious rooting in petunia cuttings  <cit> .

in the group of ethylene-related genes,  <dig> ap2-like ethylene-responsive transcription factor genes , six 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase  genes, two 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase  genes, and five ethylene-insensitive protein-like genes were identified. h2o <dig> treatment up-regulated the expression of aco and acs genes at 24 h but down-regulated their expression from 6 h to 24 h, indicating an increase in ethylene biosynthesis at 6 h compared with water treatment. ethylene-insensitive protein  <dig> , a central factor in signalling pathways regulated by ethylene, is involved in various processes including development, plant defences, senescence, nucleotide sugar flux, and tropisms  <cit> . the gene coding for ethylene-overproduction protein 1-like , which functions as an essential regulator of the ethylene pathway by regulating the stability of acs enzymes, was down-regulated from 6 h to 24 h  <cit> . most ap2/erf genes were down-regulated at 6 h but up-regulated from 6 h to 24 h. these genes may be involved in the regulation of gene expression by stress factors and by components of stress signal transduction pathways  <cit>  and have also been shown during adventitious rooting in petunia  <cit> . ethylene and its crosstalk with auxin have been showed to be required for adventitious root formation  <cit> . these results suggest that the h2o2-induced process leading to adventitious rooting may modulate ethylene gene expression, and this mechanism has been revealed in iba-induced adventitious rooting  <cit> .

six cytokinin-related degs were detected. of these degs, a cytokinin-induced message gene that code for expansin-like b <dig>  <cit> , was down-regulated 11-fold at 6 h but up-regulated 62-fold from 6 h to 24 h. a gene for cytokinin dehydrogenase  <dig> that degrades the phytohormone cytokinin  <cit> , two genes for cytokinin hydroxylase-like that catalyses the biosynthesis of trans-zeatin in plants  <cit> , and a cytokinin riboside 5′-monophosphate phosphoribohydrolase log <dig> that converts inactive cytokinin nucleotides to the biologically active free-base forms  <cit>  were down-regulated from 6 h to 24 h. this result indicates that h2o <dig> treatment inhibited cytokinin activity via the regulation of cytokinin-related gene expression. the same result was shown in iba-induced adventitious rooting  <cit> .

nine degs, including a gibberellic acid-stimulated protein  <dig>  seven gibberellin oxidase genes, and a gir <dig> gene, were down-regulated from 6 h to 24 h, while a gibberellin receptor gid1b-like was up-regulated during this period. both gibberellic acid-stimulated protein  <dig> and gir <dig> are the gasa gibberellins-regulated cysteine-rich proteins that are involved in cell division and/or elongation and that respond to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . the gibberellin oxidases are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of gibberellins and are involved in the production of bioactive ga for vegetative growth and development  <cit> . similar to iba treatment, h2o <dig> decreased the expression of the ga synthesis genes, leading to inhibition of ga synthesis  <cit> .

in summary, the above results indicate that, during the process of h2o2-induced adventitious rooting, h2o <dig> initiated auxin and ethylene signalling and repressed cytokinin and gibberellins signalling for improving rooting.

transcription factor -encoding genes were significantly regulated during h2o2-induced adventitious rooting
we further analysed the tf-coding degs during h2o2-induced adventitious rooting. a total of  <dig> degs with both fold change >  <dig> and rpkm ≥  <dig> were identified . during the 6-h treatment, the genes coding for bhlh , myb , zinc finger protein , wrky , nac , myb-like , homeobox-leucine zipper protein , dof , arf , and bzip  were highly up-regulated, while genes coding for ap2/erf , lbd , and aux/iaa  were down-regulated. of those genes, the most highly up-regulated tf genes were ap2-like ethylene-responsive transcription factor at1g16060-like  and myb <dig> , while the most highly down-regulated tf genes were lob domain  -containing protein <dig> , two erf086-like , wrky22-like , and zinc finger protein zat11-like . this result indicates that 6-h h2o <dig> treatment enhanced the expression of most of the tf genes except for most of the genes for ap2/erfs and lbds, which were decreased. during 24-h treatment, the genes coding for zf , wrky , and nac  were up-regulated, while the genes coding for ap2/erf  and bhlh  were down-regulated. of those genes, erf098-like , zinc finger protein stop <dig> homologue , wrky <dig> , and wrky31-like  were the most highly up-regulated tf genes, while the most down-regulated tf gene was transcription factor org2-like . clearly, the degree of up-regulation of the tf genes was higher than that of down-regulation, indicating that 24-h h2o <dig> treatment highly enhanced the expression of certain tf genes.table  <dig> transcription factor-coding genes that were differentially regulated by h2o <dig> treatment




comparing ho <dig> with ho <dig>  the tf genes for ap2/erf , myb , zf , lbd , wrky , and nac  were up-regulated, of which the genes for erf lep-like, erf086-like, lbd 16-like, erf098-like , erf088-like, wrky31-like, ap2/erf ail6-like, zinc finger protein stop <dig> homolog, wrky <dig>  zinc finger protein zat11-like, myb-like, bhlh135-like, lob 33-like, nac 100-like , bhlh93-like, mads-box transcription factor 1-like, hsf b <dig>  myb <dig>  lob 13-like, myb <dig>  hsf b-3-like, and myb <dig> were up-regulated 4- to 202-fold. the genes for bhlh , homeobox , myb , aux/iaa , nuclear tf , nac , hsf , ap2/erf , wrky , and zf  were down-regulated, of which the genes for myb <dig>  homeobox-leucine zipper protein hox27-like, erf034-like, myb4-like, bhlh126-like, erf 15-like, zinc finger ccch domain-containing protein 15-like, nac 43-like, myb86-like, bhlh18-like, zinc finger protein constans-like 15-like, hsf a-6b-like, transcription factor pif4-like, zinc finger protein magpie-like, bhlh137-like, transcription factor une10-like, hsf c-1-like, transcription factor bee 3-like , erf shine 3-like, and ap2/erf at1g16060-like were down-regulated 4- to 14-fold. this result indicates that most of the tf genes were down-regulated from 6 h to 24 h except for ap2/erf, zf, and lbd family genes; moreover, the degree of up-regulation of these genes is far greater than that of down-regulation.

notably, aux/iaa proteins are short-lived transcriptional factors that function as repressors of early auxin response genes at low auxin concentrations  <cit> . h2o <dig> treatment down-regulated the aux/iaa genes but up-regulated the arf genes, suggesting the involvement of h2o <dig> in the auxin signalling, which has been shown to be a key regulator of adventitious rooting  <cit> . furthermore, lbd family genes are up-regulated by auxin  <cit>  and have been found to act early in auxin signalling and to regulate adventitious rooting  <cit> . of those genes, lob <dig> and lob <dig> were up-regulated 16- to 32-fold by iba treatment  <cit> . in this study, five lbd family genes were up-regulated 4- to 31-fold by h2o <dig> treatment from 6 h to 24 h, of which lob <dig> was up-regulated 31-fold. most of the ap2/erf family genes were down-regulated at both 6 h and 24 h but up-regulated from 6 h to 24 h. for example, genes for erf lep and erf086-like were up-regulated by 202-fold and 60-fold, respectively. these two genes have been shown to act as cell division-promoting factors involved in various processes of plant developments such as leaf blade differentiation and inflorescence branching  <cit> . erf <dig> is also involved in the control of cell division patterns during early lateral root primordium development  <cit> . although most of the ap2/erf family genes were down-regulated at both 6 h and 24 h, the erf at1g16060-like and erf098-like were up-regulated by 7- and 238-fold at 6 h and 24 h, respectively. these two genes have been known to be involved in the regulation of gene expression by stress factors and by components of stress signal transduction pathways  <cit> . these results imply that h2o <dig> treatment initiated the ethylene signalling pathway, leading to adventitious rooting via up-regulating both the expression of stress responsive erf genes at 6 h and 24 h and cell developmental erf genes from 6 h to 24 h. recently, a number of studies have reported that the ap2/erf family genes were the most highly regulated tfs  <cit>  and were key endogenous regulators of adventitious rooting in petunia  <cit>  and poplar  <cit>  and iba-induced adventitious rooting in mung bean  <cit> . in addition, the wrky and nac family genes were highly up-regulated at 6 h and 24 h. these two families of genes have been known to be involved in plant defence responses. nac proteins are also involved in developmental processes, including the formation of the shoot apical meristem, floral organs and lateral shoots, as well as in plant hormonal control  <cit> . some of nac proteins, such as transcription factor jungbrunnen 1-like, are involved in modulating cellular h2o <dig> levels and enhancing tolerance to various abiotic stresses through the regulation of dreb2a  <cit> .

heat shock proteins -coding genes were significantly regulated by h2o <dig> treatment
interestingly, we found that a large number of genes coding for heat shock proteins  and heat stress transcription factors  were significantly up-regulated during h2o <dig> treatment. therefore, we screened the genes with both fold change >  <dig> and rpkm ≥  <dig>  and  <dig> hsps and  <dig> hsfs were identified . amongst these genes,  <dig> hsp genes were up-regulated 2- to 98-fold at 6 h,  <dig> hsp genes were up-regulated 2- to 94-fold at 24 h, and  <dig> hsp genes were up-regulated 2- to 4-fold from 6 h to 24 h. heat shock proteins are known to act as stress proteins, and their up-regulation is described more generally as part of the stress response  <cit> . many researchers have reported that this family of proteins was produced by cells in response to exposure to stressful conditions, including heat shock, cold, uv light, nitrogen deficiency, water deprivation, and wounding  <cit> , as well as exogenously applied h2o <dig>  <cit> . many hsp members function as intra-cellular chaperones that can protect other proteins against stress-induced denaturation and aggregation by stabilizing new proteins to ensure correct folding or by helping to refold proteins that were damaged by stress  <cit> . clearly, our result indicates that the up-regulation of hsp genes and hsf genes is an important mechanism under h2o2-induced adventitious rooting in mung bean seedling.table  <dig> hsp coding genes that were differentially up-regulated by h2o <dig> treatment




validation of gene expression by qrt-pcr
the rpkm values of the degs obtained from the transcriptome were validated using real-time quantitative pcr . for qrt-pcr, we selected a total of  <dig> interesting degs; the results are shown in fig.  <dig>  detailed information regarding these genes is presented in additional file  <dig>  we selected the housekeeping gene cpy <dig> as an internal reference gene for qrt-pcr measurement. the expression levels of most of the genes, as measured by qrt-pcr, showed a strong correlation to the rna-seq data . the qrt-pcr results showed that the expression levels of  <dig> genes, including arf <dig>  arf <dig>  arf <dig>  arf <dig>  arf <dig>  arf <dig>  arf <dig>  iaa <dig>  iaa <dig>  iaa <dig>  iaa <dig>  lax <dig>  aux22e, aux22b, lbd <dig>  nhx <dig>  nac, nac <dig>  nac <dig>  nac <dig>  rd <dig>  ahk <dig>  ahk <dig>  ahk <dig>  myb <dig>  and myb <dig>  significantly decreased at 6 h and 24 h in both the water and h2o <dig> treatments, but h2o <dig> treatments significantly up-regulated their expression at 6 h compared with the water controls. the expression levels of pin <dig>  aux15a, lbd <dig>  lbd <dig>  adh1b, qorl , per <dig> , and per <dig> significantly increased at both 6 h and 24 h. compared with the water controls, h2o <dig> treatments significantly up-regulated the expression of pin <dig>  aux15a, lbd <dig>  lbd <dig>  and adh1b at 24 h; up-regulated the expression of qorl at both 6 h and 24 h, but down-regulated the expression of per <dig> and per <dig> at both 6 h and 24 h. the expression of aux15a and aux22c significantly increased at 6 h and then decreased at 24 h. this result is fully consistent with the degs analysis from the rna-seq data, and further indicates the roles of h2o <dig> in regulating genes expression.fig.  <dig> validation for the rna-seq data using qrt-pcr. the qrt-pcr data were compared with rna-seq data and the con, wat  <dig>  and wat  <dig> data were from our previous study  <cit> . bars represent the mean  of three replicates. different letters  represent statistically significant differences  among the qrt-pcr data, which were analysed using student’s t-test




the genes involved in the auxin signalling pathway are required for the formation of adventitious roots. the auxin efflux carrier pin family members and auxin influx carrier aux family members mediate auxin polar transport and control auxin distribution to establish and maintain auxin concentration gradients for various developmental processes  <cit>  including adventitious rooting  <cit> . the arfs  <cit> , gh3-like proteins  <cit> , and lbds  <cit>  have also been shown to be essential for adventitious root formation. nac proteins are involved in plant developmental processes  <cit>  and defence responses  <cit> . for example, nac <dig> mediates auxin signalling to promote lateral root development  <cit> . ahk <dig> functions as an osmosensor histidine kinase and is required for the regulation of desiccation processes  <cit> . ahk <dig> acts as a cytokinin receptor and, together with ahk <dig>  functions as a redundant negative regulator of drought and salt stress responses and abscisic acid signalling  <cit> . these proteins were shown to be involved in the water stress response during the early vegetative stages of plant growth and regulation of meristem development  <cit> . arabidopsis mutants lacking ahk <dig>  ahk <dig>  and ahk <dig> exhibited enhanced adventitious root growth  <cit> . adh <dig>  and nhx <dig>  are involved in the osmotic stress response  <cit> . dehydration-responsive protein rd <dig> was up-regulated by dehydration, salt stress and abscisic acid and can enhance drought tolerance  <cit> . the arabidopsis homologue of quinone oxidoreductase-like protein  belongs to chloroplastic nadph-dependent alkenal/one oxidoreductase  which contributes to detoxifying lipid peroxide-derived reactive carbonyls  produced under oxidative stress and to protect respiration and growth  <cit> . pers are involved in the removal of h2o <dig>  oxidation of toxic reductants, biosynthesis and degradation of lignin, suberization, auxin catabolism, and responses to environmental stresses, such as wounding, pathogen attack and oxidative stress. briefly, these q-pcr results confirmed that h2o2-priming up-regulated the expression of several auxin signalling-related genes, such as arfs, aux/iaas, and pins, and several genes from the lob and myb transcription factor families, particularly promoting the expression of various stress response- and oxidative-related genes, such as pers and qorl, to further increase the stress tolerance of the cells.

in summary, all the above results indicate that a majority of most highly up- or down-regulated genes were similar during both h2o2- and iba-induced adventitious rooting, suggesting the similar regulation pattern of gene expression in the processes  <cit> . this supports the concept that h2o <dig> is an important component of auxin-mediated adventitious root formation in cuttings  <cit> . for example, both h2o <dig> and iba treatments up-regulated the genes coding for auxin signalling pathway proteins gh3s, abp, and auxin-induced proteins, whereas down-regulated aux/iaa and arfs genes; up-regulated genes coding for ethylene signalling pathway proteins ap2/erfs, acs, and aco, while down-regulated some members of ap2/erfs; up-regulated cytokinin-induced message genes but down-regulated cytokinin synthesis genes; up-regulated the cell wall related expansins and polygalacturonse genes while down-regulated caspl genes; up-regulated the most of lobs and wrkys transcription factor genes but down-regulated the most of bhlhs and mybs genes; up-regulated gst, pods, and polyphenol oxidase genes that are related to cell redox homeostasis but down-regulated some members of pod genes; up-regulated gdsl esterases and sugar transporter genes involved in metabolism but down-regulated lox genes. however, some significant differences on gene expression levels were also observed between h2o <dig> and iba treatments. for example, major of the most highly regulated genes by h2o <dig> were those involved in stress response, for iba, were those involved in auxin signalling, and ethylene signaling pathways, as well as lob family and meristems and primordial development-related. in addition, a lot of genes involved in secondary metabolism and flavonoid biosynthesis were down-regulated by iba. many of small hsps and hsfs genes were up-regulated by h2o <dig>  in short, iba application primarily initiated the auxin signalling processes, whereas, h2o2-priming initially started the stress response processes, further leading to adventitious rooting in mung bean seedlings  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
it is well known that h2o <dig> functions as an important regulator molecule that is involved in many signalling pathways in plant cells. exogenous application of h2o <dig> at an appropriate level has been demonstrated to improve cell tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. low concentration application of h2o <dig> also acts as a promoter of adventitious root formation. the present study provides a transcriptome insight into the molecular basis of specific responses to h2o <dig> priming under adventitious rooting in mung bean. h2o <dig> treatment highly increased the number of reads, the ratio of expressed genes, and the abundance of gene expression. in terms of the time duration, h2o <dig> strongly influenced the cell metabolism and functions by regulating gene expression, particularly up-regulating gene expression at 6-h time point, which is the induction phase for adventitious rooting in mung bean. the gene ontology  classification, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway enrichment, and differentially expression genes  profiling results revealed that h2o <dig> triggers adventitious rooting through the regulation of many cellular processes, including the functions associated with stress response, cell redox homeostasis and oxidative stress response, secondary metabolism and flavonoid synthesis, cell wall loosening and modification, nutrients and energy metabolic processes, cellular component movement, transcription, dna synthesis, cell cycle, and transcription factors , as well as plant hormone signalling pathways. in some ways, the gene expression profile that specifically responds to h2o <dig> during adventitious rooting in mung bean was similar to that in response to iba. last, this study provides a list of candidate genes that specifically respond to h2o <dig> priming in plants.

by integrating the results of go and ko enrichment and analyses of most highly differentially expressed genes in response to h2o <dig>  we proposed a model including the most highly regulated pathways by h2o2-priming that might be involved in the induction and initiation of adventitious roots in mung bean seedlings .fig.  <dig> a proposed model of important pathways that were highly regulated by h2o2-priming illustrates the molecular respects during the induction and initiation stages of adventitious roots in mung bean seedlings. the most highly regulated genes under each pathway are listed in fig.  <dig>  and additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 5
