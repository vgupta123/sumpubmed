BACKGROUND
ca2+ is an essential element for almost all organisms and plays comprehensive regulatory roles in eukaryotic cells; therefore, ca2+ must be maintained within a narrow concentration range in organisms . in terrestrial vertebrates, the whole-body ca2+ balance is mainly achieved by intestinal absorption and kidney reabsorption. ca2+ uptake mechanisms in the mammalian kidney have been most extensively studied, while fish gills, a specialized organ in non-mammalian vertebrates, is another model for studying ca2+ uptake mechanisms  <cit> . in fish, gills are the main site  of ca2+ uptake from the aquatic environment to maintain the ca2+ balance  <cit> , and skin takes the place of gills during early developmental stages when the gills are not yet developed and functioning  <cit> . compared with terrestrial vertebrates, ca2+ regulation mechanisms in aquatic animals are probably more complicated and challenging because of the dramatic fluctuations in ambient ca2+ concentrations which can occur .

according to the current model in mammals, active and transcellular ca2+ transport is carried out as a 3-step process  <cit> . following entry of ca2+ through apical epithelial ca2+ channels , ca2+ is bound to calbindins that facilitate diffusion to the basolateral membrane, and then it is extruded via the plasma membrane ca2+-atpase  and/or na+/ca2+ exchanger . in this way, net transepithelial ca2+ absorption from the luminal compartment  to the plasma is accomplished. a model of the capability of physiological regulation has also been similarly proposed in fish gills  <cit> . however, only very little molecular evidence is currently available to support this model in fish gills, which is a specialized organ for ca2+ uptake. the ecac gene has recently been cloned and sequenced in fugu, zebrafish, and trout  <cit> . in zebrafish embryos, low-ca2+ fresh water causes upregulation of the whole-body ca2+ influx and zecac expression in mitochondrion-rich  cells of both gills and skin, providing molecular evidence for the role of ecac in fish ca2+ uptake  <cit> . on the other hand, some biochemical and physiological studies have investigated the possibility of pmca and ncx's involvement in fish gill ca2+ uptake  <cit> . nevertheless, no convincing evidence has been presented demonstrating the existence and involvement of pmca and ncx in fish ca2+ uptake mechanisms.

three ncx genes  and  <dig> pmca genes  have been identified in mammals so far. the fundamental work of pmca is the highly regulated active extrusion of ca2+ from cells for maintaining a gradient across the plasma membrane  <cit> . pmca belongs to the p-type primary ion transport atpase superfamily with  <dig> transmembrane domains and  <dig> calmodulin-binding site. at least  <dig> alternative splicing variants of pmca have been found in mammals  <cit> . in mammals, pmca <dig> and pmca <dig> are ubiquitously expressed, whereas pmca <dig> and pmca <dig> are more tissue specific; it has been suggested that pmca <dig> and pmca <dig> are housekeeping isoforms involved in the maintenance of cellular ca2+ homeostasis  <cit> . however, no molecular data about pmcas are available in fish. on the other hand, at least  <dig> alternatively spliced isoforms of ncx <dig> gene products have been identified  <cit> . knock-out of ncx <dig> in mice is lethal due to cardiac defects before birth  <cit> , while many physiological studies have indicated that vitamin d <dig> modulates ca2+ balance by upregulating ncx <dig> expression  <cit> . recently, ncx1- <dig> and ncx <dig>  another putative prototype of ncx, have been reported in fish, indicating the existence of ncxs in non-mammals as well  <cit> . however, there is no molecular physiological evidence to support the involvement of ncx in fish ca2+ uptake mechanisms.

because of a theoretical process of whole-genome duplication  from ancestor vertebrates  <cit> , the numbers of gene isoforms found in teleosts are usually more than those found in mammals and tetrapods. while different isoforms coded from distinct genomic loci tend to have tissue-specific expressions, there are some cases of isoforms being differentially regulated upon facing environmental changes  and  <dig> isoforms of ncxs  were identified. moreover, we report that some duplication of pmca and ncx occurred, and the tissue distributions and expression patterns of these isoforms were analyzed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  and triple fluorescence labeling, respectively. the gene expressions in gills of zebrafish acclimated to high- or low-ca2+ environments were also examined by quantitative real-time pcr analysis. the present study provides molecular evidence to support the current ca2+ uptake model in fish gill cells  <cit> .

RESULTS
molecular cloning and bioinformatics analysis of pmca and ncx
in this whole-genome survey,  <dig> distinct pmcas  and  <dig> distinct ncxs  were found in zebrafish. according to the phylogenetic analysis, these transporters were annotated as zpmca1a, zpmca1b, zpmca <dig>  zpmca3a, zpmca3b, zpmca <dig>  and zncx1a, zncx1b, zncx2a, zncx2b, zncx <dig>  zncx4a, and zncx4b . zncx1a and zncx1b were previously described and named zncx1h and zncx1n, respectively  <cit> , and zncx2a, zncx <dig>  zncx4a, and zncx4b have also been published  <cit> . however, zncx2b and the other zpmcas are first described in this study.

based on the topological structures of pmca and ncx summarized in mammals  <cit> , zebrafish pmcas and ncxs share similar patterns as mammals at the deduced amino acid sequences. according to the hydropathy analysis,  <dig> putative transmembrane domains were predicted for zpmca , whereas ncx has  <dig> hydrophobic segments and  <dig> putative transmembrane domains  due to an intracellular helix front transmembrane domain  <dig> and a p loop-like structure of hydrophobic segment  <dig>  which contained the amino acid sequence "gig"  <cit> . pmca and sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium atpase , the closest kin to pmca, share a similar topological structure: hydrophobic segments span the membrane  <dig> times, and  <dig> intracellular loops consist of ca2+ binding and transporting, and calmodulin-regulating functions  <cit> ; the zpmcas were also found to have  <dig> cytoplasmic domains  <dig> each between tm <dig> and tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig>  and tm <dig> and the c-terminal . as for ncx, a large intracellular loop for ion translocation  <cit>  was located between tm <dig> and tm <dig> . there were  <dig> alternative splicing isoforms of zpmcas found when cloning was conducted, while  <dig> alternative splicing isoforms were found in zncxs . the hot spots of alternative splicing regions in the zpmcas are at the 5' untranslated regions , the fragments around the 300th amino acid including from  <dig> to  <dig> small exons , and 3' amino acid tails that usually stretch to the 3' utr and alter the location of stop codons. on the other hand, a region of alternative splicing sites was found in zncx1b and zncx <dig> around the 610th amino acid, which is a part of the intracellular loop.

zpmcas share 63%~86% identities with each other, while zncxs exhibit higher variety among isoforms . according to the phylogenetic analysis, zebrafish and  <dig> pufferfish species so far all have  <dig> pmca and  <dig> ncx isoforms . compared with the isoforms annotated in tetrapods, duplication from the ancestor ray-finned fish occurred in pmca <dig>  pmca <dig>  ncx <dig>  ncx <dig>  and ncx <dig>  according to the latest version of the genomic database utilized. moreover, in the karyotype, zpmcas and zncxs are located on different chromosomes , suggesting that these paralogous groups may have originated from genome duplication but not from tandem duplication. relationships among these pairs of duplicates were evident not only in the phylogenetic tree, but also in their gene structures . all teleost pmcas and ncxs examined in this study showed an outgroup topology to their orthologues of mammals , and the paralogous teleosts formed an inner-group topology. the  <dig> prototypes of ncxs, ncx4a and ncx4b, found in teleosts were most closely related to ncx <dig> and ncx <dig> in both phylogenetic trees  and gene structures . in gene structures, all of them had a relatively large first exon, even though some small introns were found in the split exons in zncx4s .

mrna expressions of pmca and ncx in various tissues
rt-pcr analysis revealed that zpmca <dig> and zpmca <dig> were ubiquitously expressed in various tissues compared with zpmca1a, zpmca1b, zpmca3a, and zpmca3b . all zpmcas were abundant in the brain and eye except zpmca1b, which was mainly expressed in the eye. these findings agree with the ca2+ homeostasis function of pmcas found in the mammalian neuron system  <cit> . zncx1b and zncx4a were also ubiquitously expressed, while zncx2b and zncx <dig> were only detected in the brain and eyes. zpmca1a, zpmca1b, zpmca <dig>  zpmca3a, and all the zncxs were expressed in ovary and 1-cell embryo , suggesting that these genes may regulate intracellular ca2+ homeostasis at earlier stages. zpmca1a, zpmca <dig>  zpmca <dig>  zncx <dig>  and zncx4a were expressed in gills .

effects of environmental ca2+ levels on ecac, pmca, and ncx mrna expressions
according to the quantitative real time-pcr analysis, low-ca2+ fw-acclimated zebrafish expressed significantly higher levels of zecac in gills than did high-ca2+ fw-acclimated fish . however, no significant difference was found between the  <dig> groups in the expressions of any of the zpmcas and zncxs . consistent with the results of the tissue scans shown in figure  <dig>  zpmca <dig>  zpmca1a, and zpmca <dig> exhibited more than 20-fold higher expression levels than did the other zpmca isoforms in gills, whereas zncx1b was found to have an approximately 5-times stronger signal compared with the other zncxs .

colocalization of ecac, pmca, and ncx mrnas and na+-k+-atpase
fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry were used to determine the isoforms of zpmca and zncx that were specifically expressed in gill ionocytes. specific mrna probes of all of the zpmca and zncx isoforms were used to conduct the in situ hybridizations for whole-mount embryos and adult gills. among the isoforms, only zpmca <dig> and zncx1b mrna signals were found in specific groups of cells in embryonic skin and adult gills .

subsequently, double-fluorescence in situ hybridizations were used for zecac and zpmca <dig> , and zecac and zncx1b , respectively. more gill cells expressed zpmca <dig> and zncx1b mrnas than zecac mrna . notably, zpmca <dig> and zncx1b were also abundantly expressed in gill lamellae, where fewer mr cells are usually found  <cit> . zecac and zpmca <dig> mrnas were colocalized only in a portion of gill cells, but were not colocalized all of the time. around half of the zecac-positive cells co-expressed zpmca <dig> signals , while only  <dig>  +/-  <dig> %  of zpmca2-positive cells showed zecac signals . similar results were found in the case of double labeling of zecac and zncx1b . the proportion of zncx1b-positive cells that co-expressed zecac was  <dig>  +/-  <dig> % , while zncx1b signals could be detected in all zecac-positive cells .

the subsequent triple-labeling experiments further demonstrated the colocalization of zecac mrna/zpmca <dig> mrna/na+-k+-atpase , and zecac mrna/zncx1b mrna/na+-k+-atpase , respectively, in specific groups of gill ionocytes. taken all together, only a portion of gill ionocytes co-expressed the mrna of zecac, zpmca <dig>  and zncx1b, and na+-k+-atpase.

discussion
so far,  <dig> pmca genes have been identified in mammals, and pmca <dig> and pmca <dig> were suggested to be housekeeping isoforms. mammalian pmca <dig> was found to be expressed in the hair bundle of hair cells of the inner ear  <cit> , suggesting that it is responsible for endolymph ca2+ homeostasis  <cit> . a null mutation of pmca <dig> caused balance and hearing defects in mice  <cit> . on the other hand, mammalian pmca <dig> was deemed a major ca2+ extrusion transporter for ca2+ absorption in intestine and kidney  <cit> . our data demonstrated opposite phenomena in fish pmcas. zpmca <dig> was expressed with a housekeeping pattern , while zpmca1a showed a hair cell expression pattern during embryonic stages . this functional substitution of paralogues found in ca2+ transporters is not a unique example. in zebrafish, the expression profiles suggest the hypothesis that zebrafish hoxb1a and hoxb1b are functional equivalents of mouse hoxb <dig> and hoxa <dig>  respectively. on the contrary, the zebrafish orthologue of mouse hoxa <dig>  zebrafish hoxa1a, is not expressed in a similar pattern  <cit> . further examination of the promoter regions of these genes may provide insights into this phenomenon. as far as our data, zpmca <dig> was proposed to participate in the transcellular ca2+ uptake pathway in fish gills. ncx1a and ncx1b from teleosts including zebrafish and pufferfish were not clustered within an inner group on the phylogenetic tree . further collection is necessary to enlarge the sequence pool, which may allow us to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree or to rename members of the gene family. in the present study, zncx1b was demonstrated to be responsible for the ca2+ extrusion mechanism in fish gill cells, while the paralogue, zncx1a, was proven to be a heart-specific isoform that causes cardiac fibrillations in zncx1a mutants  <cit> . the combined functions from both zncx1s are equivalent to those of mammalian ncx1; however, investigations of the direct function of ncx <dig> in ca2+ absorption were not possible due to fatal heart failure in knockout mice. therefore, teleosts may serve as a good model to examine the role of ncx in ca2+ uptake without resulting heart failure.

as described above, flik et al.  <cit>  proposed a model of a fish gill ca2+uptake mechanism, which is similar to that for ca2+ reabsorption in mammalian kidneys  <cit> . there has been no convincing or comprehensive molecular evidence to support the existence of the  <dig> major transporters, ecac, pmca, and ncx, in fish gill ionocytes until the present study. pan et al.  <cit>  for the first time demonstrated the expression of zecac in a subset of mr cells in zebrafish skin/gills and a correlation between zecac expression and in vivo ca2+ uptake function. subsequently in rainbow trout, perry and colleagues found the expression of ecac mrna and/or protein in both pavement and mr cells in rainbow trout  <cit> , which is inconsistent with the current view that mr cells are the predominant site for branchial ca2+ uptake  <cit> , and the authors also reported that hypercapnia, implantation with cortisol, and infusion with cacl <dig> affected ecac expression in mr cells and/or pavement cells  <cit> . in a recent study on isolated trout gill cells, pna+ mr cells showed an over 3-fold higher 45ca2+ uptake capacity compared to either pna- mr or pavement cells  <cit> . the subset of gill mr cells and/or pavement cells that expressed ecac is not necessarily involved in transepithelial ca2+ uptake as hwang and lee  <cit>  claimed, because those previous studies lacked molecular and physiological data to demonstrate the transport pathway across the basolateral membrane. the present triple in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical experiments demonstrate the co-expressions of zecac, zpmca <dig>  and zncx1b in a specific group of gill mr cells, providing comprehensive molecular evidence for the involvement of these transporters in a fish gill ca2+ uptake mechanism.

double in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry experiments indicated that about 90% of gill mr cells expressed zecac mrna, although this may have been underestimated because the antigenicity of na+-k+-atpase  is attenuated during the high-temperature treatments used for in situ hybridization. all zecac-expressing cells co-expressed zncx1b, and about half of the zecac-expressing cells co-expressed zpmca <dig>  indicating that about 50% of zecac-expressing cells co-expressed both zncx1b and zpmca <dig>  taking all these findings into account, only about 45% of the entire population of mr cells co-express zecac, zpmca <dig>  and zncx1b, and this subset of ionocytes may specifically carry out the function of transepithelial ca2+ uptake in zebrafish gills. it was noted that some gill cells express only  <dig> or  <dig>  of the  <dig> major ca2+ transporters. these cells may be in the process of terminal differentiation as hsiao et al.  <cit>  reported in skin ionocytes in zebrafish embryos. alternatively, the ca2+ transporter expressed in those cells may be involved in intracellular ca2+ homeostasis or other cellular events  <cit> . this remains to be confirmed in future studies.

ecac is a vitamin d-sensitive transporter in mammals  <cit> , and the expression of pmca <dig> was also found to be stimulated by  <dig> d <dig> in mammals and chicken  <cit> .  <dig> -vitamin d <dig> was shown to have a hypercalcemic effect on both freshwater and saltwater teleosts  <cit> , whereas stanniocalcin, a predominant hypocalcemic hormone produced by stannius bodies, was found to show opposite effect on fish  <cit> . stanniocalcin did not show a significant effect on basolateral ca2+ transport  <cit> , but quickly reduced the permeability of ca2+ at the apical membrane  <cit> . it has been proposed that ecac is the rate-limiting step and the gatekeeper channel for active ca2+ transport  <cit> . the present study provides further molecular physiological evidence to support this notion. the present study for the first time demonstrates that acclimation to a low-ca2+ environment, which would stimulate ca2+ uptake capacity in fish  <cit> , caused upregulation of mrna expression of zecac but not zpmca <dig> or zncx1b, implying that the steady-state expressions of zpmca <dig> and zncx1b may fulfill the requirement for the transepithelial transport machinery under all situations. moreover, this study provides molecular evidence to support a previous biochemical study by flik et al.  <cit> , who found that the basolateral ca2+ extrusion mechanisms by pmca and ncx is far below their maximum capacity in fish gills based on the kinetic properties of the  <dig> enzymes.

CONCLUSIONS
the major findings of the present study were that   <dig> pmcas and  <dig> ncxs were identified from zebrafish tissues;  differential expressions of these genes were found in various tissues including gills;  acclimation to low-ca2+ environment stimulated the mrna expression of ecac in gills, but not those of pmcas or ncxs; and  only a portion of gill mr cells co-expressed zecac, zpmca <dig>  and zncx1b mrnas.
