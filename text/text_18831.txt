BACKGROUND
clinical multidrug resistance  to bactericidal antibiotics is driving research into the underlying mechanisms of resistance and the discovery of novel drugs. in the past decade, numerous resistance proteins have identified, including the ubiquitous atp-binding cassette  family of multidrug transporters
 <cit> . these integral membrane proteins mediate the active extrusion of antibiotics and toxic compounds from cells. recent crystal structure analyses revealed that some abc-type multidrug proteins, such as msba from e. coli, vibrio cholera, and salmonella typhimurium <cit>  and btucd from e. coli <cit> , also mediate the import of substrates by altering the conformation of the transmembrane helices  from an ‘outward-facing’ state to an ‘inward-facing’ state
 <cit> . the abc transporters represent 2% of gene products in bacteria and play a critical role in their adaptation to the environment
 <cit> . some are involved in resistance to chemotherapy and, therefore, applied research has increasingly focused on the elucidation of the transportation mechanism of these proteins
 <cit> . furthermore, the self-protection afforded by the antibiotic producers is dependent on its endogenous drug resistance proteins. therefore, these resistance proteins may also represent targets for antibiotic production improvement strategies
 <cit> .

streptomyces rimosus, well known as an oxytetracycline  producer, has been investigated at the genetic level over many years, although only two antibiotic pump genes have been discovered to date: the otc resistance gene, otrb <cit>  and a putative abc transporter gene, otrc, which has been isolated, sequenced and deposited in genbank . the two open read frames  of the otrc gene encode a putative abc transporter atp-binding subunit and a putative transmembrane subunit. otrc was considered to be a putative abc transporter with an otc resistance function based on its amino acid sequences, although no evidence in support of this has been reported to date. generally, the location of resistance genes in the chromosome is close to the corresponding antibiotic biosynthesis clusters. in the case of otc, the otc cluster in s. rimosus is flanked by the resistance genes, otra and otrb <cit> , while otrc is distant from the otc cluster . we hypothesize that otrc plays a role as the mdr transporter in otc resistance. here, we present evidence that otrc encodes a protein with atpase and multidrug efflux activities and therefore may represent a manipulation target for strategies to improve of otc production in s. rimosus.

RESULTS
conserved motifs analysis and model prediction of otrc
the otrc gene contains two open reading frames , which encode a putative atp-binding subunit  of 38 kda and a putative transmembrane subunit  of 30 kda. a ncbi blast search of the amino acid sequence of the otrc protein identified a number of similar proteins, the majority of which were abc components of doxorubicin or mdr abc transporters from various phyla.

the atp-binding subunit usually contains conserved sequence motifs that play important roles in protein function. therefore, an alignment of otrc-orf <dig> with drra
 <cit>  and msr-orf <dig> from streptomyces <cit>  was performed for the identification of conserved motifs . the results showed that otrc-orf <dig> exhibits 41% amino acid identity with the doxorubicin resistance protein drra from s. peucetius and 43% identity with the multidrug abc transporter atp -binding subunit msr-orf <dig> from s. rochei f <dig>  the n-terminal of otrc-orf <dig> contains the well-described conserved walker a and b motifs and the abc signature sequence. these motifs are intimately involved in atp hydrolysis
 <cit> , which indicates that otrc belongs to the abc transporter superfamily. the alignment also showed the conserved ldeadqla and ldevfl motifs in the c-terminal region of otrc-orf <dig>  these motifs exhibit  <dig> % and 80% identity with those of drra and msr-orf <dig>  respectively. however, the creem motif was absent from otrc-orf <dig> and msr-orf <dig>  the ldevfl motif is known to be involved in the doxorubicin-stimulated nucleotide-binding function and also exists in the mdr protein
 <cit> . therefore, it was speculated that the atpase activity of otrc-orf <dig> is stimulated by doxorubicin and other drugs.

in contrast, the transmembrane subunit has more sequence diversity and varies in the total number of transmembrane helices. otrc-orf <dig> was then aligned with other abc transporters . the conserved eaa motif  that is present in malg was believed to be present only in the importers of the abc family, while the g−2e−1…a3r/k4…g <dig> motif present in btuc, which has similarity with eaa motif, has been identified in both the import and export functions of abc transporters
 <cit> . the alignment analysis revealed the present of a g−2….r <dig> motif that was present in all abc transporter proteins with an exporter function, including epea, drrb, msba and btuc. the g− <dig> residue has been identified to correspond with drug sensitivity by site-directed mutagenesis
 <cit> . we therefore assumed that the g−2….r <dig> motif was involved in the drug export function of the abc transporter and otrc functions as a drug exporter.

the prediction of the secondary structure of otrc-orf <dig> by the prof method using the predictprotein program  indicated the presence of a n-terminal hydrophobic domain with six putative α-helical transmembrane segments and cytoplasmic facing n and c termini. the reported canonical abc systems display a modular architecture composed of two nucleotide-binding domains/subunits and two transmembrane domains/subunits. therefore, it can be concluded that the otrc system is a tetrameric complex composed of two homodimeric constituents, similar to that of many other bacterial abc transporters
 <cit> .

functional characterization of otrc
e. coli bl <dig>  cells were transformed with the indicated plasmid petc <dig> , while otrc expression was induced by iptg and analyzed by coomassie blue staining of the sds-polyacrylamide gels  and western blotting. a band that corresponded to the 30-kda otrc-orf <dig> was detected in the cytoplasmic membrane by sds-page ; however, although the otrc-orf <dig> was fused with a his6-tag at the c terminal, the specific band of the gene product was absent in the western blot analysis. this could have been due to the embedding of the his6-tag by protein folding. the specific band that corresponded to the 68 kda-otrc, 38 kda-otrc-orf <dig> subunit could be visualized in whole cell protein fraction by sds-page and western blot analysis . these specific bands of otrc and its subunits were absent from e. coli that carried the empty pet28a plasmid, which suggested the successful heterologous expression of otrc in e. coli.

the malachite green assay was employed to determine the atpase activity of otrc. the results showed that the atpase activity of e. coli/petc <dig>  was significantly higher than that of e. coli/pet28a  , which indicates as expected that otrc has atp hydrolysis activity.

fluorimetric eb, a cationic substrate of abc transporters, was employed for the efflux assays to test if otrc can mediate the transport coupled to atp hydrolysis. the cells of e. coli transformants were suspended in 20 μm eb solution, and the eb efflux activity was triggered by glucose. as shown in figure
5a, the energization of cells resulted in an increased rate of eb extrusion for otrc-expressing cells compared to the control cells, which indicates that otrc displays an atp-dependent extrusion activity. the efflux activity of otrc was further confirmed by determining the effect of an abc transporter inhibitor orthovanadate on the accumulation of eb in otrc-expressing and otrc-nonexpressing cells. as the glycolysis pathway also can be inhibited by orthovanadate, cells were energized with atp instead of glucose. as shown in figure
5b, orthovanadate increased the level of eb uptake in otrc-expressing cells, while no increase was observed in otrc-nonexpressing cells. these observations indicate that orthovanadate inhibited the otrc-mediated efflux of eb.

effect of otrc expression on drug susceptibility
in order to identify the mdr function of otrc, the otrc-overexpressing and non-expressing mutants of the s. rimosus m <dig> strain were constructed and identified as described in the materials and methods .

several drugs with clinical importance were employed for drug susceptibility assays of otrc-overexpressing and otrc-nonexpressing strains of e. coli as well as s. rimosus. as shown in tables 
 <dig> and
 <dig>  the mic for ampicillin increased by  <dig> -fold, and in the order of  <dig>  fold for doxorubicin, 2-fold for eb and vancomycin in e. coli/petc <dig> compared with e. coli/pet28a. the mics of e. coli/petc <dig> to otc and ofloxacin were enhanced at 5 μg/ml and 2 μg/ml, respectively; in contrast, the growth of e. coli/pet28a was completely inhibited by these drugs. however, the overexpression of otrc had no effect on the susceptibility of e. coli to rifampicin, erythromycin and streptomycin .

‘-’, cell growth was completely inhibited.

‘+’, cell growth could not be inhibited by the antibiotic; ‘-’, cell growth was completely inhibited.

a clear difference in drug sensitivity to these drugs was also found in s. rimosus mutants m4018/psec and m4018/pkcΔotrc with respect to the control strain m4018/pset <dig>  the overexpression of otrc in m4018/psec resulted in significantly elevated mics to ampicillin , otc , doxorubicin , eb  and ofloxacin . furthermore, the otrc overexpressing mutant survived with 500 μg/ml vancomycin, while the growth of m4018/pset <dig> was completely inhibited by vancomycin . the mics for ampicillin and doxorubicin in the otrc-disrupting mutant m4018/pkcΔotrc were decreased by 20%, compared to a decrease of 67% for otc; however, the disruption of otrc had no effect on eb and vancomycin sensitivity . neither the otrc-overexpressing mutant nor the otrc-disrupting mutant showed any alternation in the sensitivity to rifampicin, erythromycin and streptomycin , which was in agreement with the results of drug susceptibility assays in otrc-overexpressing e. coli cells.

the otrc overexpressing cells showed a significantly enhanced mic to ampicillin, otc, doxorubicin, eb, ofloxacin and vancomycin, which indicated that otrc functions as a drug exporter with a broad range of drug specificities.

otrc expression affects otc production in s. rimosus
in order to explore the applications of otrc for antibiotic production, the identified recombinant plasmids, psec and pkcΔotrc , were introduced into an industrial otc overproducer, sr <dig>  after identification as described in the materials and methods. mutant strains were used for otc production measurements in addition to the mutant derived from strain type m <dig>  the results showed that the mutant m4018/psec yielded an otc production peak of  <dig>  μg/ml at 96 h, which was markedly higher than that of m4018/pset <dig> , while the otrc disruption mutant m4018/pkcΔotrc yielded a decreased otc production peak of  <dig>  μg/ml at 168 h . the otc production peak in m4018/psec at an earlier time than the controls suggested that the otc efflux function of otrc plays an important role in self-protective mechanisms and otc production.

the otc production profile in sr <dig> mutants showed that the otc production of the otrc knock-in mutant sr16/psec reached a peak of  <dig> .1 mg/l at 72 h, which was  <dig> -fold greater than that of sr16/pset <dig> at 96 h. in contrast, the production of otc was markedly reduced in the disrupted mutant sr16/pkcΔotrc. it yielded an otc production rate of  <dig>  mg/l at 168 h, which was approximately 80% of the peak production of sr16/pset <dig> . these results were in agreement with the above-mentioned conclusion that otrc expression efficiently affects otc production in s. rimosus.

the transcription levels of otrc in otrc-expressing s. rimosus strains were measured by qrt-pcr. the transcription level of otrc was significantly enhanced in s. rimosus m4018/psec compared with the control strain m4018/pset <dig> , which explains the significant improvement of otc production in m4018/psec. for the industrial overproducer sr <dig>  the otrc duplication mutant sr16/psec showed a marked enhancement in the transcription of otrc compared with the negative control, sr16/pset <dig> . these results suggest that otrc overexpression was responsible for otc overproduction in m4018/psec and sr16/psec.

discussion
the bacterial atp-binding cassette  family of multidrug transporters contains very important resistance proteins that have evolved over a long period. in the present study, we characterized the function of otrc, a putative abc transporter, from s. rimosus and report that otrc has major effects on the overproduction of otc in s. rimosus.

the multidrug exporter function of otrc from s. rimosus
the results of the amino acid sequence alignment analysis showed that otrc contains a n-terminal atpase activity-related conserved motif and a drug resistance activity-related motif at the c-terminal . as the highly conserved ldevfl motif of drra at the c-terminal was shown to be involved in doxorubicin efflux, this indicated that otrc might also be associated with antibiotic resistance. the present results  show that drug susceptibility levels to tetracycline, eb and floxacin were enhanced in strains of e. coli and s. rimosus that overexpressed otrc compared to corresponding otrc-nonexpressing strains, which were very similar findings to those published previously regarding drra and msr-orf1
 <cit> . additionally, we hypothesized that the low level of conservation of the amino acid sequence in the ldeadqla motif of otrc-orf <dig>  may be responsible for the consistently low sensitivity to erythromycin of otrc-expressing cells.

otrc-orf <dig> contains the g−2…r <dig> conserved motif, but does not possess the eaa conserved motif . the former might be involved in drug export function, and the latter was identified to be involved in import function
 <cit> . to verify the function of otrc as a drug transporter in cells, the e. coli cells that overexpressed otrc were given glucose, which resulted in the extrusion of eb rather than its uptake as was expected . furthermore, when the abc transporter inhibitor orthovanadate was added, eb extrusion was not observed in the otrc-expressing cells supplemented with atp. this indicated that otrc is responsible for the eb export activity in otrc-expressing e. coli transformant. hence, the drug resistance mechanism of otrc could be based on atp hydrolysis coupled with its transport ability.

the otrc-expressing e. coli transformant showed significantly enhanced susceptibilities to ampicillin, doxorubicin, otc, eb, vancomycin and ofloxacin . however, the mics of s. rimosus mutants to ampicillin, otc, doxorubicin and ofloxacin were markedly amplified compared with controls , which suggested that otrc could play an important role in the self-protection mechanisms of s. rimosus. interestingly, the mic of m4018/psec to vancomycin was 500 μg/ml, and the growth of m4018/pkcΔotrc and m4018/pset <dig> was completely inhibited under these conditions. this implies that otrc acts as an efficient vancomycin efflux pump. additionally, the significantly enhanced vancomycin resistance activity in s. rimosus m4018/psec might be attributed to the strong constitutive erme* promoter, which results in the overexpression of otrc during the early growth phase.

effect of otrc expression on otc production in s. rimosus
the m <dig> strain showed a stable production of otc. in contrast, the sr <dig> mutants showed an obvious drop of otc production after 3 days, which was probably due to the instability of sr <dig> . a red pigment was observed during sr <dig> fermentation , which, to our knowledge, has not been previously described in s. rimosus. we speculate that another competitive secondary metabolic pathway was activated in sr <dig> during the traditional mutation.

the real-time qrt-pcr analysis showed that otrc overexpression could lead to a significant otc production improvement by secreting otc out of cells in both the m4018 s. rimosus strain and an industrial overproducer, sr <dig>  hence, it is reasonable to suggest that otrc could be a valuable target for genetic manipulation, such as introducing extra copies of the abc transporter
 <cit> , overexpressing the pathway genes with the use of transcription regulators
 <cit>  and the replacement of heterologous promoters
 <cit> , in order to yield the overproduction of otc.

CONCLUSIONS
otrc is a putative abc-type transporter in s. rimosus, although it has been considered to be an otc resistance protein. however, the drug resistance function and mechanism of otrc have not been studied previously. in this study, the alignment of the amino acid sequence of otrc suggested that it could belong to an abc superfamily and could act as an atp-binding drug exporter, which was further identified by atpase activity determination and eb efflux assays in this study. the results of the drug susceptibility tests showed that otrc confers a functional resistance toward a broad range of structurally unrelated drugs. hence, otrc is a multidrug resistance protein based on an atp hydrolysis-dependent active efflux mechanism. it is the first reported multidrug resistance abc transporter in s. rimosus.

the further investigation of mutations of conserved amino acid residues that inhibit the otrc pump could be valuable for controlling drug resistance in clinically important pathogens. improvements in otc production were successfully made by introducing an extra copy of otrc into the high-performance sr <dig> strain, while the disruption mutant displayed a decreased otc yield. this highlights the potential value of otrc in otc industrial production. future studies on the otc efflux activity of otrc and the effects of otrc overexpression in s. rimosus will contribute to improvements in otc production.
