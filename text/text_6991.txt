BACKGROUND
high levels of soil salinity impose osmotic stress and ion toxicity on plants, leading to cell damage and growth arrest. most crop plants are sensitive to excess salt concentration in soil  <cit> . with the salt-affected farming land expanding nowadays , salinity stress has become one of the most serious limiting factors in crop production. as an urgent global challenge of food security occurs, it is of great importance to understand the mechanism underlying plant response to salinity stress and develop novel salinity tolerant crop cultivars.

in the past few decades, extensive studies on salinity stress in plants, especially in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana, have uncovered a number of genes involved in plant salt tolerance  <cit> . both abscisic acid -dependent and -independent signaling pathways play important roles during this process  <cit> . aba insensitive  <dig>  is an ap2/erebp transcription factor that functions as a positive regulator in the aba signaling pathway during seed development and germination  <cit> . abi <dig> participates in other aspects of plant development, including salinity response and retrograde signaling . under salinity stress, three loss-of-function mutations in abi <dig> conferred increased tolerance in both seedling and adult stage, while the transgenic plants overexpressing abi <dig> were hypersensitive to nacl treatment  <cit> . further studies revealed that abi <dig> negatively regulated the expression of a high affinity k+ transporter, hkt1; <dig>  by directly binding to two abi4-binding elements  in hkt1;1’s promoter region  <cit> .

besides osmotic stress and ion toxicity, high salinity condition also adversely affects photosynthesis, cellular energy depletion and redox homeostasis . production and accumulation of excess reactive oxygen species , such as superoxide  and hydrogen peroxide , cause oxidative damages in apoplastic compartments and cellular membranes. ros also function as signaling molecules to activate gene expression in nucleus  <cit> , including a number of ros scavenging genes, such as catalase   <cit> . in a. thaliana, a transient burst of ros production follows the imposition of abiotic stresses, and any disruption to ros synthesis has a negative effect on the plant’s growth and its ability in stress response  <cit> .

chloroplast is closely associated with salt response in plants. it is not only a factory for energy assimilation but also the site for synthesis of aba and other important metabolites, for pyruvic acid serves as the precursor. the bile acid/sodium symporter  <dig>  is responsible for pyruvate uptake into chloroplast  <cit> . in arabidopsis bass2- <dig> mutant, the plastidal isopentenyl diphosphate  synthesis is blocked, so the mutant seedlings exhibit increased sensitivity to mevastatin, an inhibitor of cytosolic ipp synthesis pathway  <cit> .

as an important staple crop, bread wheat belongs to glycophytes and displays high sensitivity to excess soil salinity, while its halophytic relative tall wheatgrass  is able to grow at salt concentrations as high as in seawater. in our previous study, a salinity-tolerant introgression wheat cultivar shanrong no.  <dig>  was bred using asymmetric somatic hybridization  <cit> . sr <dig> wheat plants exhibited high level of tolerance under osmotic and saline stresses, and better performance in removal of toxic substances  <cit> . in a further transcriptomic study, we identified a putative pyruvate transporter gene, tabass <dig>  was up-regulated by nacl treatment in sr <dig> instead of salinity-sensitive jn <dig>  <cit> . here, we isolated the tabass <dig> sequence and characterized its role in salinity tolerance. constitutively expressing tabass <dig> enhanced the salinity tolerance in transgenic wheat and arabidopsis. the ros contents and scavenging activity were enhanced in the transgenic plants as well. further experiments indicated tabass <dig> positively regulates plant response to salinity stress by repressing abi <dig> expression.

RESULTS
tabass <dig> is induced by nacl treatment
to determine the expression pattern of tabass <dig> under salinity stress, three-leaf-stage sr <dig> seedlings were treated with 200 mm nacl solution and monitored tabass <dig> expression in roots. as shown in fig. 1a, tabass <dig> was induced by two-fold as early as 1 h of the treatment, and the expression level increased up to four-fold at 24 h. the treatment with h2o <dig> or aba also resulted in a similar induction of tabass <dig> expression at 24 h . these results demonstrated that tabass <dig> expression responded to high level of salinity as well as other stress signals. various tissue types were also collected for another expression assay. the result showed that tabass <dig> was transcribed in all the tested tissues, with higher expression levels in the green tissues .fig.  <dig>

to study the biological role of tabass <dig> in plant response to salinity stress, the coding sequence  was cloned from a cdna library constructed from the nacl-treated sr <dig> seedlings. the resulting cds was  <dig>  bp in length, encoding a 413-aa putative bass protein with eight transmembrane domains. the ncbi non-redundant protein sequence database was searched for the homologues, and  <dig> similar proteins across various organisms were found. the multi-alignment with five closest homologs showed that the most conserved regions resided in the eight transmembrane domains . a phylogenetic analysis clustered the wheat bass amino acid sequence with those from monocots. the sequences from dicotyledonous species, including bass <dig> , clustered together, which together with the monocotyledonous cluster formed a bass <dig> clade. since the wheat bass protein sequence shared a high similarity with bass <dig>  the gene was therefore named as tabass <dig>  which was the first bass gene cloned in bread wheat.

tabass <dig> complements arabidopsis bass2- <dig> mutant
arabidopsis bass <dig> is a sodium-dependent pyruvate transporter localized in plastid. its knockout mutant in arabidopsis, bass2- <dig>  displays increased sensitivity to mevastatin  <cit> . to determine whether tabass <dig> has the same function as bass <dig>  the arabidopsis bass2- <dig> mutant was transformed with a 35s::tabass <dig> construct. two transgenic lines with high tabass <dig> expression levels, bass2-1;35s::tabass <dig> # <dig> and # <dig>  were selected to test the sensitivity to mevastatin . after a ten-day treatment with  <dig> nm mevastatin, the bass2- <dig> seedlings showed severe abnormality in cotyledon, while the bass2-1;35s::tabass <dig> seedlings developed a normal phenotype, the same as the wild-type arabidopsis . this result demonstrated that tabass <dig> completely complemented the mevastatin-sensitive phenotype of bass2- <dig>  moreover, the tabass2-gfp fusion protein was localized in plastid when transiently expressed in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts . these results together indicate that tabass <dig> is a genuine homolog of bass <dig>  which functions as a pyruvate transporter.fig.  <dig>

overexpressing tabass <dig> enhanced salinity tolerance in wheat seedlings
the induction of tabass <dig> by the nacl treatment suggests its role in plant response to salinity stress . to characterize its function in wheat, tabass <dig> was overexpressed in a salinity sensitive wheat cultivar ym <dig>  from  <dig> independent transgenic lines, two lines  with high transgene expression were selected for further experiments . both ox <dig> and ox <dig> transgenic lines developed shorter shoots and roots than the empty vector control  seedlings . thus, to determine the extent of salinity tolerance, the shoot/root lengths of nacl-treated plants were normalized by dividing the shoot/root lengths of untreated plants to get relative shoot/root growth rates. after an eight-day nacl treatment, the relative shoot growth in the vc line was around 72 % of that under the control condition, and the relative root growth was around 85 % compared with that under the control condition, displaying suppression in plant growth under high nacl concentration. however, in the nacl-treated ox <dig> and ox <dig> plants, both the shoot and root growth showed less suppression compared with the vc plants. after the nacl treatment, the relative shoot growths were 98 % and 95 % compared with the control in ox <dig> and ox <dig>  respectively, and the relative root growths were 90 % and 91 % of those under the control condition . these phenotypic results demonstrated that constitutively expressing tabass <dig> relieved the growth suppression imposed by high saline concentration, thus enhanced salinity tolerance in the transgenic wheat plants.fig.  <dig> constitutively expressing tabass <dig> enhances salinity tolerance in wheat. a, b the vector control  and two ubi::tabass <dig> wheat seedlings  after an eight-day mock or nacl treatment. bar = 1 cm. c

the constitutive expression of tabass <dig> in a. thaliana enhanced the salinity tolerance
to further reveal its biological role in salinity tolerance, transgenic arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing tabass <dig> driven by a 35s promoter were generated, from which two independent lines with high tabass <dig> expression levels, oe <dig> and oe <dig>  were selected for further experiments . the wild-type and transgenic lines were treated with a series concentrations of nacl to determine their salinity response. given that the roots of transgenic arabidopsis seedlings were shorter than those in the wild-type , the relative root growth rate was calculated to determine their salinity tolerance. under a 50 mm nacl treatment, the relative root growth rates of wild-type plants were 53 % of those under the control condition, while the relative root growth rates in the both transgenic plants were 73 % of those under the control condition . when the nacl concentration was raised to 100 mm, the relative root growth in the wild-type was 27 %, but 47 % and 33 % in oe <dig> and oe <dig>  respectively ; under the 125 mm nacl treatment, the relative root growth was about  <dig>   <dig> and 20 % in the wild-type and the two oe lines, respectively . this result demonstrated the arabidopsis seedlings with constitutive expression of tabass <dig> exhibited enhanced tolerance to salinity stress.fig.  <dig> constitutively expressing tabass <dig> enhances the salinity tolerance in arabidopsis.

a further experiment was carried out to determine the salinity tolerance in the adult transgenic plants constitutively expressing tabass <dig>  four-week-old soil-grown wild-type and two 35s::tabass <dig> lines were treated with increasing concentration of nacl for 14 days, and the survival rates were scored at the 14th day following the treatment . as shown in fig. 4f, after a ten-day nacl treatment, the leaves of wild-type plants developed chlorosis, while the leaves of oe plants showed less severe response. at the 14th day after treatment, more than half of the wild-type plants died of high levels of soil salinity, while the majority of oe plants kept alive and even grew bigger . consistent with the phenotypic response, the survival rate was 47 % in the wild-type plants at the 14th day after treatment, while it was 72 % and 58 % in the oe <dig> and oe <dig> lines respectively, significantly higher than that in the wild-type . it is also interesting to mention that bass2- <dig> mutant showed no difference in the survival rate under nacl treatment, probably due to the cytosolic ipp pathway . these results showed that the 35s::tabass <dig> transgenic plants exhibited enhanced tolerance to nacl treatment in both seedling and adult stages, demonstrating that constitutive expression of tabass <dig> enhanced salinity tolerance in arabidopsis.

the transgenic arabidopsis constitutively expressing tabass <dig> showed the enhanced oxidative tolerance
ros is involved in plant response to salinity stress. to determine the role of tabass <dig> in oxidative stress response, the 35s::tabass <dig> arabidposis plant were assessed under h2o <dig> treatment. as shown in fig. 5a, b and d, under the treatment of 1 mm h2o <dig>  the relative root growth rate of the wild-type plants was 25 % of that under the control condition, significantly smaller than the relative root growth rates  of oe <dig> and oe <dig>  respectively. when the h2o <dig> concentration was raised to  <dig>  mm, the relative root growth rates were  <dig>   <dig> and 29 % in the wild-type, oe <dig> and oe <dig> seedlings, respectively . these results demonstrated that the transgenic arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing tabass <dig> had higher tolerance to oxidative stress than the wild-type plants did. moreover, treatment with methyl viologen , which generates superoxide anions in plastids, demonstrated that these oe lines also displayed enhanced tolerance to plastidial oxidative stress .fig.  <dig> constitutively expressing tabass <dig> enhances ros content and ros scavenging activity. a-c the wild-type seedlings and two 35s::tabass <dig> transgenic lines  after a ten-day treatment with  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  mm h2o <dig>  bar = 1 cm. d relative root growth of the wild-type and oe plants treated with  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  mm h2o <dig>  e dab staining of the leaves from four-week-old soil-grown wild-type and oe plants. f the expression levels of atcat <dig> in 12-day-old wild-type and oe seedlings. g the catalase activity in 12-day-old wild-type and oe seedlings. error bars in  represent the standard errors , with each replicate comprising  <dig> seedlings. error bars in  represent the standard errors , with each replicate comprising at least  <dig> plants. columns labeled with an asterisk indicate means differing significantly from the wt result . the expression levels were determined by rt-qpcr using atact <dig> in arabidopsis as the internal control



dab staining results showed that both arabidopsis oe lines had higher h2o <dig> levels in vivo than the wild-type plants . and the expression levels of the ros-scavenging catalase  <dig>  were also constitutively up-regulated in the transgenic arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing tabass <dig> , along with enhanced cat <dig> enzyme activity . these results demonstrated that the constitutive expression of tabass <dig> led to an increase in ros content and ros-scavenging activity in the transgenic arabidopsis plants, suggesting constitutive activation of ros signaling.

the enhanced salinity tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis expressing tabass <dig> was achieved through repressing abi <dig> expression
aba plays an important role in response to salinity stress, so the relationship between aba signaling and the enhanced salinity tolerance was investigated in the transgenic plants constitutively expressing tabass <dig>  firstly, we found the endogenous aba contents were comparable among the wild-type arabidopsis and 35s::tabass <dig> transgenic plants . the expression levels of genes at the downstream of aba-dependent stress responsive pathway were also assessed. most of these genes, including responsive to desiccation 29a , rd29b, rd <dig> and myb <dig>  showed no difference in their expression levels between the wild-type and 35s::tabass <dig> plants . on the contrast, the expression of abi <dig>  a key component of aba signaling pathway, was reduced by more than one fold in the 35s::tabass <dig> transgenic lines compared to the wild-type . these results demonstrated that constitutively expressing tabass <dig> repressed abi <dig> expression without affecting aba biosynthesis. furthermore, the expression levels of hkt <dig>  the high affinity k+ transporter directly regulated by abi <dig>  <cit> , were higher in two oe lines than in the wild-type plants, and the na+ contents in arabidopsis shoots and roots were lower in those oe lines as well . these results were consistent with the repression of abi <dig> expression in the transgenic plants constitutively expressing tabass <dig> fig.  <dig> constitutively expressing tabass <dig> represses abi <dig> expression. a, b the expression levels of abi <dig> and hkt1; <dig> in 12-day-old wild-type and two 35s::tabass <dig> transgenic lines . error bars represent the standard errors , with each replicate comprising at least  <dig> plants. the expression levels were determined by rt-qpcr using atact <dig> in arabidopsis as the internal control c, d the na+ contents in the shoot and root tissue from ten-day-old wild-type and oe lines. error bars represent the standard errors , with each replicate comprising at least  <dig> plants. columns labeled with an asterisk indicate means differing significantly from the wt result 



as abi <dig> was repressed in the oe plants, it was of interest to determine the salinity response when abi <dig> remained comparable expression level as in the wild-type. thus, we carried out a genetic approach to constitutively express abi <dig> in 35s::tabass <dig> background. two transgenic lines  with abi <dig> expression levels comparable as in the wild type were selected for phenotypic assays . in comparison with the wild-type, both transgenic lines exhibited a similar response to nacl treatment , and comparable hkt1; <dig> expression levels . these results demonstrated the enhanced resistance conferred by ectopic expression of tabass <dig> vanished when abi <dig> expression was restored, indicating that constitutively expressing tabass <dig> in arabidopsis conferred enhanced salinity tolerance by repressing abi <dig> expression.fig.  <dig> the enhanced salinity tolerance in 35s::tabass <dig> arabidopsis plants relies on abi <dig> suppression. a-d the wild-type seedlings and two transgenic lines constitutively expressing both tabass <dig> and abi <dig>  after a ten-day treatment with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 125 mm nacl. bar = 1 cm. e relative root growth of the wild-type and tabass2oe abi4oe seedlings. error bars represent the standard errors , with each replicate comprising at least  <dig> seedlings. f, g the expression levels of abi <dig>  and hkt1; <dig>  in the wild-type and tabass2oe abi4oe seedlings. error bars represent the standard errors , with each replicate comprising at least  <dig> seedlings. the expression levels were determined by rt-qpcr using atact <dig> in arabidopsis as the internal control



the transgenic wheat plants overexpressing tabass <dig> have enhanced ros tolerance and lower na+ contents
dab staining determined wheat ox lines had higher h2o <dig> levels in vivo than the wild-type plants . the expression levels of the ros-scavenging catalase  <dig>  were also constitutively up-regulated in the transgenic wheat plants constitutively expressing tabass <dig> , along with the cat <dig> enzyme activity significantly higher in the transgenic lines . these results demonstrated that the constitutive expression of tabass <dig> led to an increase in ros contents and ros-scavenging activity in the transgenic wheat plants, suggesting a constitutive activation of ros signaling. the expression levels of tahkt1;5-d, the wheat homolog of athkt <dig>  were higher in two ox lines than in the wild-type plants . the na+ contents in shoots and roots were lower in those ox lines as well . these results suggest that tahkt1;5-d might be regulated to enhance salinity tolerance in transgenic wheat overexpressing tabass <dig> fig.  <dig> constitutively expressing tabass <dig> enhances ros tolerance and reduces na+ contents in wheat. a dab staining of the leaves from two-week-old soil-grown vector control  and two ubi::tabass <dig> lines . b the expression levels of tacat <dig> in two-week-old vc and ox seedlings. c the catalase activity in two-week-old vc and ox seedlings. d the expression levels of tahkt1;5-d in two-week-old vc and ox seedlings. error bars represent the standard errors , with each replicate comprising at least  <dig> plants. the expression levels were determined by rt-qpcr using tacyclophil in in wheat as the internal control. e, f the na+ contents in the shoot and root tissue from two-week-old vc and ox seedlings. error bars represent the standard errors , with each replicate comprising at least  <dig> plants. columns labeled with an asterisk indicate means differing significantly from the vc result 



discussion
plastid plays a vital role in plant development, stress response, and hormone biosynthesis  <cit> . since plasmid harbors its own genome, its function is orchestrated by a combination of anterograde and retrograde signaling . the primary aba biosynthesis pathway takes place in plastid; it starts with the methylerithrytol phosphate  pathway converting pyruvate to ipp  <cit> . bile acid/sodium symporter <dig>  is responsible for the transportation of pyruvate into chloroplast. knockout of bass <dig> in arabidopsis blocks pyruvate uptake into chloroplast, thus abolishes ipp synthesis in plastid, as evidenced by mevastatin-sensitive phenotype in bass2- <dig> seedlings  <cit> . the complementation of bass2- <dig> by constitutive expression of tabass <dig> demonstrates tabass <dig> functions as a pyruvate transporter in plastid . although ipp is the precursor of aba, its content in the plant tissue was unaffected by the constitutive expression of tabass <dig> . the marker genes in the aba signaling pathway remained unchanged as well . these results established that tabass2 did not affect aba biosynthesis or signaling.

abi <dig> has various biological roles in plant development and stress response . under salinity stress, abi <dig> regulates ion homeostasis by its control over the expression of the sodium ion transporter gene athkt1; <dig>  <cit> . in our 35s::tabass <dig> transgenic arabidopsis, the expression levels of athkt1; <dig> were constitutively up-regulated , which is consistent with the previous findings of abi <dig> regulating athkt1; <dig> in salt response  <cit> . moreover, the enhanced salinity tolerance was disrupted in the transgenic plants with abi <dig> expression level restored to the wild-type level . hence, the benefit of tabass <dig> constitutive expression in salinity tolerance depends on its repression of abi <dig> expression, which suggests tabass <dig> participates in salt response through regulating abi <dig> expression. because abi <dig> homolog has not been identified in wheat, it cannot be tested if tabass <dig> regulates such a signaling node in wheat response to salinity stress. however, we found up-regulation of tahkt1;5-d, the homolog of athkt1; <dig>  as well as reduced na+ concentration in the transgenic wheat seedlings overexpressing tabass <dig> . these results together suggest a similar mechanism as in arabidopsis. besides regulation of abi <dig> expression, the constitutive expression of tabass <dig> resulted in increased tissue ros contents in both wheat and a. thaliana, as did the activity of catalase and the transcription level of its encoding gene cat <dig> . as a result, the transgenic lines exhibited not just superior salinity tolerance, but also improved tolerance to oxidative stress .

how tabass <dig>  a plastidial pyruvate symporter, functions in salinity tolerance remains an interesting question. the elevated ros contents in tabass <dig> overexpression plants suggest the involvement of ros signaling in tabass <dig> function . recent studies have shown that ros not only causes oxidative stress in plant cells, but serves as potential signals in the pet retrograde signaling pathway  <cit> . ros accumulation triggers a series of stress-responsive genes, inducing ros scavenging activity and thereby contributing to the plant’s redox homeostasis  <cit> . coupled function of rbohd-derived ros production and plastid hemeoxygenases in salinity response strongly suggests that the chloroplast-to-nucleus retrograde signaling is involved in plant salinity response  <cit> . in retrograde signaling pathway, abi <dig> serves as a node in the tetrapyrrole and plastid gene expression . the pge marker genes light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein  and rubisco small subunit  are suppressed by retrograde pathway’s activator, norflurazone and lincomycin, while in arabidposis abi <dig> mutant these marker genes expression were de-repressed  <cit> . here, we also found these two genes were less suppressed in 35s::tabass <dig> plants than the wild-type , indicating that both pathways were affected by the constitutive expression of tabass <dig>  the transcription levels of genes in mecpp pathway, such as mecpp synthase  and hydroperoxide lyase , were comparable between the 35s::tabass <dig> and the wild-type plants . taken together, these results suggest that ectopic expression of tabass <dig> in arabidopsis regulates retrograde signaling by repressing abi <dig> expression.

CONCLUSIONS
here in this study, we characterized a putative plastidal pyruvate transporter, tabass <dig>  in wheat salinity response. constitutive expression of tabass <dig> enhanced salinity tolerance in both transgenic wheat and arabidopsis, accompanied with elevated ros contents and repression in abi <dig> expression. as ros and abi <dig> play crucial roles in plastid-nucleus retrograde signaling, our findings also suggest that tabass <dig> modulates retrograde signaling to positively regulate plant response to salinity stress.
