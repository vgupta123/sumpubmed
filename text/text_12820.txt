BACKGROUND
cytoplasmic male sterility is a phenotypic trait that is widespread among plants and results in the inability of the plant to produce viable pollen  <cit> . numerous studies have shown that cytoplasmic male sterility in plants is associated with aberrant recombination in the mitochondrial genome, which results in the production of chimeric orfs that are expressed as novel polypeptides  <cit> . since the first plant mitochondrial genome sequencing in arabidopsis <cit> , a large number of mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced in angiosperm plants , especially in those that contain cms cytoplasm. cms-associated mitochondrial genome of crop species reported to date include beta vulgaris <cit> , oryza sativa, triticumae stivum <cit> , zea mays <cit> , brassica napus <cit> , raphanus sativus <cit> . in this study, the mitochondrial genome of hau cms line, its maintainer line and the normal type line “j163-4” were fully sequenced and assembled into a master circle. as in other higher plants, all three sequenced mitochondrial genomes had large sizes and distinctive features, including slow evolutionary rates, rapid rearrangement, frequent insertion, complex multipartite structures, specific modes of gene expression, cis- and trans-splicing, rna editing and the use of universal genetic code  <cit> . comparative analysis of the cms line and its iso-nuclear maintainer line may help us verify the cms-associated gene in hau cms line, and contribute to a better understanding of the plant mitochondrial genome in brassicas.

the male sterile hau cms line  emerged as a spontaneous male sterile mutant in b. juncea. the anthers in the hau cms plants are replaced by thickened petal-like structures, and hau cms sterility starts at the stamen primordium polarization stage, much earlier than the other four cms systems used in brassicas   <cit> . a novel chimeric gene named orf <dig> was found to be located downstream of the atp <dig> gene and co-transcribed with this gene in the hau cms sterile line. subcellular localization analysis showed that this cms-associated gene was translated in the mitochondria of male-sterile plants. transgenic result also showed that orf <dig> is associated with the male sterility of hau cms in brassica juncea <cit> .

in this study, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes of hau cms line, its iso-nuclear maintainer line and the normal type line “j163-4” in b. juneca using roche/ <dig> pyro-sequencing technology. comparative analysis of the hau cms mitochondrial genome further confirmed that orf <dig> was a cytoplasmic male sterility-associated gene in b. juneca. the sequenced mitochondrial genomes may help us identify the mechanism of natural cms and uncover the origin and structure of the hau cms mitotype as well as understand evolutionary differences between the different mitotypes in b. juncea. our data give new insight into the evolution of the brassicas mitochondrial genome.

RESULTS
the mitochondrial genomes of the hau cms line and its maintainer line
the mitochondrial genomes of the hau cms line, its maintainer line and the normal type line “j163-4” were sequenced to an average depth of 52*, 196* and 69* multiple depths using roche  <dig> flx + pyro-sequencing technology. sequences were assembled to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contigs, respectively. the pcr primers used for the confirmation of contig linkage are listed in additional file  <dig> and the mitochondrial dna extracted from the etiolated seedlings in 7 days of the hau cms line and its iso-nuclear maintainer line were used as templates. results of the pcr amplification are presented in additional file  <dig>  a master circle was developed for each mitochondrial genome using a ‘parsimonious’ method  <cit> . given that the mitochondrial genome of the hau cms maintainer line and the line “j163-4” are identical to each other, we only performed comparative analysis of hau cms line and its maintainer line in this study. features of the hau cms line and its maintainer line mitochondrial are shown in table  <dig>  the b. juncea hau cms mitochondrial genome was assembled into a single, circular-mapping molecule with a size of  <dig>  bp and gc content of  <dig> %, both of which are close to the median values of other fully sequenced seed plant mitochondrial genomes. coding sequences constitute approximately  <dig> % of the genome, which contains  <dig> protein coding open reading frames ,  <dig> rrna genes,  <dig> trna genes, and  <dig> unidentified orfs . the size of its maintainer line is  <dig>  bp, and the gc content is  <dig> % with  <dig> % of the sequence as coding sequence. the maintainer line mitochondrial genome contains  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> rrna genes,  <dig> trna genes, and  <dig> unidentified orfs as shown in additional file  <dig> table  <dig>

after the initial sequence analysis, we compared the coding regions, orfs of unknown function and repeats of the two circular mitochondrial genomes. the electron carrier complexes i, iii, iv and v genes in the hau cms line and its maintainer line were conserved, while the rps <dig> gene encoding a subunit of ribosomal proteins in the hau cms line was absent when compared with its maintainer line. detailed information describing the trna gene content of the hau mitotype and its maintainer line  mitotype is shown in additional file  <dig>  after a comparative analysis of the predicted orfs in the two mitochondrial genomes, specific orfs were found occurring in both mitochondrial genomes. we also plotted the syntenic regions using the bl2seq algorithm with the hau cms line, its iso-nuclear maintainer line and the sequenced b. juncea  mitochondrial genome  <cit> . as shown in figure 2a, the genomic arrangement of the hau cms line mitochondrial genome was very divergent when compared with its maintainer line, with at least  <dig> apparent rearrangements. however, as shown in figure 2b, when the b. juncea mitochondrial genome sequenced by chang  <cit>  was compared with the hau cms maintainer line, no divergent genomic arrangement occurred except that of snps divergence. this result not only confirmed the accuracy of our sequence assembly but also showed that the hau cms line mitochondrial genome was extensively rearranged when compared with its maintainer line.figure  <dig>

repeats in the hau cms line and its maintainer line
repeats in the plant mitochondrial genome may be relevant to the rapid rearrangement, frequent insertion and complex multipartite structure in plant mitochondrial genomes. based on mitochondrial genomes of the hau cms line and its maintainer line, detailed information for repeated sequences greater than 100 bp was annotated in additional file  <dig> and shown in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  the number of repeats greater than 100 bp in the hau cms line  was almost two fold of that in its maintainer line . there were  <dig> direct repeats and  <dig> inverted repeats in the hau cms line, as well as  <dig> direct and  <dig> inverted repeats in its maintainer line. the largest repeats in the hau cms line were  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp with only  <dig> different indels between them . the largest repeats in the maintainer line were 2293 bp, and both were direct repeats. recombination across inverted repeats inverts the intervening sequences, whereas recombination across directly oriented repeats separates the genome into pairs of sub-genomic molecules  <cit> . repeats smaller than 100 bp were also investigated in the mitochondrial genome of the hau cms line and its maintainer line. intriguingly, we observed many small repeats in the  <dig> sequenced mitochondrial genomes. in both the hau cms line and its maintainer line, there were more than  <dig> short repeats smaller than 100 bp. some large repeats also contained a few small repeats smaller than 100 bp. the largest repeat in the mitochondrial genome of the hau cms line in figure 3a was analyzed, which encompassed  <dig> small direct repeats. the border of this repeat, the initiation codon of these small repeats and the nucleotide sequences of these three small repeats were marked. the same phenomenon was also found in other large repeats in the hau cms line and its maintainer line mitochondrial genomes. apparently, these small repeats were part of the large repeats. however the relations between these large and small repeats remain unclear. it is known that sub-genomic molecules are produced from the mc molecule through intra-molecular recombination. different sub-genomic molecules may constitute different mitochondrial genomes through recombination of these direct and inverted repeats. the short repeated sequences in higher plant mitochondria are usually inactive and may play key role in irreversible recombination producing a new stable mitochondrial genome structure  <cit> . these short repeats as part of the larger repeats in mitochondrial genome may help us to answer how the large repeats emerged, expanded and then gave rise to complex multipartite structures of plant mitochondrial genomes. three large repeats larger than 100 bp were also found between syntenic regions of atp <dig> and atp <dig> . they were located downstream of orf <dig>  which may be relevant to the emergence of this cms-associated gene.figure  <dig>

the specific orfs of different mitochondrial genomes
we further analyzed those orfs of unknown function in the sequenced mitochondrial genomes in this study. there were  <dig> and  <dig> such orfs in the hau cms line and its maintainer line, respectively. by virtue of mitochondrial rearrangement and indel mutations, specific orfs were found in the hau cms line and its maintainer line mitochondrial genome. there were  <dig> mitotype specific orfs in the hau cms line and its maintainer line separately. sequence analysis revealed that orf113a in the hau cms line had only snps differences when compared with orf113b in its maintainer line. although orf117b in the hau cms line had not been detected in its maintainer line, it was detected in the sequenced mitochondrial genomes reported by chang  <cit> . thus, we chose only  <dig> orfs from each of the  <dig> lines. among them orf <dig>  orf <dig> and orf <dig> were hau mitotype-specific orfs, while orf <dig>  orf <dig> and rps <dig> were the maintainer line specific orfs . pcr amplification of the mitochondrial specific scar markers was developed based on these specific orfs from the two sequenced mitochondrial genomes. they were both efficient in distinguishing the hau cms line from its maintainer line at the seedling stage. we confirmed these by pcr analysis after developing the mitochondrial specific orf markers which are shown in additional file  <dig>  as demonstrated in figure  <dig>  the p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> primers combinations were specific to the a line  while p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> primers were specific to the b line  after 25 cycles. however, after  <dig> and 35 cycles, hau cms specific orfs were amplified slightly in the maintainer line, and the hau cms maintainer line specific orfs were also amplified in the hau cms line, especially with the p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> primers. it is noteworthy that there was evidence suggesting that substoichiometrically different mitotypes coexisted in hau cms lines and their maintainer lines as reported by chen  <cit> .table  <dig>

subsequently, total rna was isolated from flower buds, fresh leaves, roots and hypocotyls . we examined the transcript pattern of these specific orfs in the hau cms line and its maintainer line. as shown in figure  <dig>  orf <dig> was constitutively expressed in all tissues tested, while orf <dig> was not detectable in the roots and orf <dig> only appeared in leaves and the etiolated seedlings of the hau cms line. in its maintainer line, orf <dig> was only expressed in the leaves, while the orf <dig> and rps <dig> were undetectable at the etiolated seedling stage. apart from orf <dig>  which was known to be the cms-associated gene in the hau cms line, understanding the function of these orfs requires further investigation.figure  <dig>

orf <dig> and rps <dig> both appeared in the flower, leaf, and root. however, orf <dig>  which is similar to orf <dig>  only appeared in the leaf of hau cms maintainer line.



the hau cms-associated gene orf <dig> in brassica juncea
cms is often associated with specific open reading frames  in plant mitochondrial genomes, but the origin of many cms-associated genes and the mechanism of this phenomenon are still unclear. utilizing next-generation sequencing, many more plant mitochondrial genomes have been released, especially for cms-associated genomes of various crops such as rice, maize, wheat, sorghum and rapeseed . value of mitochondrial genome information is also well established in the study of evolutionary patterns and processes of cms-associated genes in plants. results from transgenics showed that orf <dig> was responsible for the male sterility of hau cms in b. juncea <cit> . cms-associated genes in different mitochondrial genomes are often located downstream of the genes encoding components of the electron transport respiratory chain. for example, orf <dig> in the b.napus polima cms line, orf <dig> in the rice boro cms line, and orf <dig> in the ogura cms line are all located downstream of atp <dig>  the orf <dig> in the sunflower pet <dig> cms line is located downstream of atp <dig> <cit> . almost all these cms-associated genes were chimeric genes and had transmembrane domains. the transmembrane domains of these specific open reading frames in hau cms line were predicted using tmhmm server version  <dig> . this revealed that apart from orf <dig>  orf <dig> also had the transmembrane domains, albeit its function is still unknown. the hau cms-associated gene orf <dig> was also located downstream of atp <dig>  but how the cms-associated gene emerged remained unclear. the  <dig> large repeats located downstream of orf <dig> might have been relevant to the emergence of the cms-associated gene. like most cms genes, orf <dig> has similarities to known functional mitochondrial genes. apart from the unknown origin , the chimeric orf <dig> gene also contains a 94 bp partial sequence of nad <dig>  a subunit of complex i in the electron transport chain system. this is similar to the case of the 5′ region of the gene orf <dig> as reported in alloplasmic male sterile brassica tournefortii <cit> . the 3′ region was also similar to another predicted mitochondrial orf, orf <dig> in b. juncea . this result suggested that this recombinant structure evolved recently. by way of blast alignment analysis, it can be seen that orf <dig>  orf <dig>  orf <dig> and orf <dig> were homology sequenced separately from the sequenced mitochondrial genomes of b. tournefortii, b. napus, b. juncea and r. sativus in brassicaceae. other than orf <dig>  the cms-associated gene in brassica tournefortii and orf <dig> was previously reported by christopher a. makaroff in a cytoplasmic male sterility radish  <cit> . the other two open reading frames only appeared in the male fertility mitochondrial genomes of b. napus and b. juncea. a maximum-likelihood inference-based dendrogram was used to generate phylogenetic trees based on conserved orf <dig> genes in mitochondrial genomes . molecular phylogenetic analysis indicated that orf <dig> bore a strong similarity to orf <dig> in brassica tournefortii and the mitochondrial genomes of b. napus and b. juncea might be closer to each other than r. sativus.figure  <dig>

we also comparatively analyzed the mitochondrial genome of hau cms with the mitochondrial genomes of nap , cam , jun , ole , car , polima  and ogura  in brassicas. a phylogenetic guide tree  and locally collinear blocks  relating these eight sequenced mitochondrial genomes were calculated by using neighbor joining of the mauve alignment system. the  <dig>  kb segment from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp in ole mitochondrial genome was deleted for the reason that tandem repeats >10 kb in total length without an anchor are ignored by mauve. cluster analysis of the eight mitochondrial genomes showed that the mitochondrial genomes of hau cms and ogura cms are both diverged from the other six mitochondrial genomes in brassicas. and the evolutionary relationships among the six analyzed homologous mitotypes are consistent with previous research by chang  <cit> . these results confirmed the hau cms mitotype which caused male sterility in brassicas might be heterogeneous when compared with the other related mitotypes at molecular level.figure  <dig>

discussion
comparative analysis of the mitochondrial genome of the hau cms line with its maintainer line
over the past two decades, our knowledge of the organization and evolution of mitochondrial genomes has been rapidly expanding as a large number of fully sequenced mitochondrial genomes have been published along with their structure, expression and evolutionary profiles. in light of the pivotal role of the cms line in crop breeding and its convenience for studying the cytoplasmic and nuclear interaction, we compared the mitochondrial genomes of the hau cms line and its iso-nuclear maintainer line to investigate the origin of the hau cms mitotype and to dissect the structural and evolutionary differences between the different mitotypes. mitochondrial genome of the hau cms line  was larger than its maintainer line  and the repeats  appeared noticeably more frequent than those in its maintainer line. the size of plant mitochondrial genome was relevant to the repeats it contained, and the repeats in the mitochondrial genomes also revealed the structural dynamics of the mitochondrial genome in plant development via intramolecular and intermolecular recombination. in this study, we report that small repeats  might contribute to larger repeats  in the sequenced hau cms mitochondrial genome, but the emergence of these small repeats and their function in the hau cms line and its maintainer line mitochondrial genomes requires further study.

as reported in rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , pearl millet  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , b. napus <cit>  and cybrids in brassicaceae <cit> , our results also confirmed that substoichiometrically different mitotypes coexist in mitochondrial genomes of the hau cms line and its maintainer line in b. juncea. the ratio of the alternative genomes may be variable, but in plants, the usually prevalent main genome is accompanied by sublimons—substoichiometric mitochondrial dna  molecules  <cit> . in plants, the relative copy number of recombination-derived sub-genomic dna molecules within mitochondria is controlled by nuclear genes and a genomic shifting process can result in their differential copy number suppression to nearly undetectable levels  <cit> . most of the mitotype-specific orfs in one mitochondrial genome present at a substoichiometric level in the other genome. at 25 cycles of pcr amplification, only templates carrying specific orfs were able to produce a detectable pcr product in the hau cms line and its maintainer line, and when the cycles were up to  <dig> to  <dig>  all primer pairs  used were able to amplify specific orfs in hau cms line and its maintainer line, but the pattern of amplification differed in the  <dig> lines. the substoichiometric amount of specific orfs from one genome to the other is thus sufficient to be detected by pcr amplification but not enough to have been picked up by the coverage depth of the  <dig> sequencing that was performed  <cit> . although substoichiometrically different mitotypes coexist in mitochondrial genomes of different plants, the molecular mechanism of such coexistence in different mitotypes requires further study. the coexistence of different mitotypes may play a prominent role in the coordination of nuclear and mitochondrial interaction and also make valuable contributions to the hybrid vigor in different crop plants.

heterosis plays an irreplaceable role in china’s high-yield crop production, and male sterility, which is a prerequisite for the mass production of hybrid seeds, acts as a key factor  <cit> . cytoplasmic male sterility  in plant, which is determined by the mitochondrial genome is associated with a pollen sterility phenotype and caused by mitochondrial genome mutation. identification of a cms-associated gene and uncovering the mechanism of this trait may facilitate plant breeding. with the sequenced mitochondrial genome, more novel mitochondrial genome types and molecular markers for cytoplasm classifications will be identified. recently, chang et al.  <cit>  sequenced the mitotypes of cam , ole , jun  and car  and analyzed them together with previously sequenced mitotypes of b. napus  to show the evolutionary mechanism of mitochondrial genome formation in brassica. molecular markers such as rflps, aflps, scars, and ssrs were used to distinguish the cms line from its maintainer line in the brassicas. based on the sequenced mitochondrial genome, specific scar markers  were also developed to separate the hau cms line from its maintainer line at the seedling stage.

the origin and emergence of the cms-associated gene orf <dig> in b. juncea
a large number of cms-associated genes have been found in crop species, but the origin and precise mechanism of cms remains elusive. in different cms systems, the cms-associated genes show little or no structural relationship. often the cms-associated genes or loci are located close to an atp gene or contain parts of a gene encoding an atpase subunit and are co-transcribed with flanking mt-genes  <cit> . although the cms phenotype also occurs at different stages during reproductive development, they were the root cause of male sterility. in our study, the cms-associated gene orf <dig> located downstream of atp <dig> and is co-transcribed. the transgenic result further verified that orf <dig> is associated with the male sterility of hau cms in brassica juncea <cit> . as a chimeric gene, orf <dig> is composed partially of nad <dig> and orf <dig> in b. juncea, and there were  <dig> large repeats larger than 100 bp located downstream of orf <dig>  these repeats may be related to the formation of the cms-associated gene. although it has relatively high similarity with orf <dig> in alloplasmic male sterile brassica tournefortii at the nucleotide level, the restorer lines for tour cms systems were found to be ineffective for restoring fertility in the hau cms line. this may suggest that they were different from each other  <cit> . a comparative analysis of the mitochondrial genome of the hau cms line and its maintainer line further confirmed that orf <dig> was cms-associated gene in hau cms line in b. juncea.

voluminous evidence suggests that mitochondrial gene expression can affect the function of the nuclear gene products that control floral development. in honglian cytoplasmic male sterile rice, the cms-associated gene orfh <dig> impaired mitochondrial function via interaction with p <dig> , and resulted in an energy production dysfunction and oxidative stress in mitochondria, which may work as retrograde signals leading to abnormal pollen development  <cit> . in wild abortive cms rice, wa <dig> accumulates preferentially in the tapetum of anthers, where it inhibits cox <dig> function in peroxide metabolism and triggers premature tapetal programmed cell death and consequent pollen abortion. these cms models provided a mechanistic link between the gain of function of a newly identified mitochondrial cms gene product and the loss of activity of the essential nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein through their detrimental interaction  <cit> . it is thus likely that different recombinations in different plant mitochondrials gave rise to different chimeric genes that caused male sterility through interaction with genes in the anther development pathways and eventually caused male sterility in different cms systems. this hypothesis might explain why dissimilar cms genes in different plants all caused similar phenotypic male sterility. the nature of different cms-associated genes that interact with the anther development pathways still needs to be studied further.

CONCLUSIONS
the hau cms mitochondrial genome was highly rearranged as was reported for mitochondrial genomes in cms lines of other crops. the chimeric cms-associated gene orf <dig> was composed of 94 bp partial sequences of nad <dig>  and 749 bp sequences that were highly similar to orf <dig> in its maintainer line. three large repeats downstream of orf <dig> may be related to the formation of the cms-associated gene in the hau cms line. these findings may help us to identify the mechanism of natural cms in b. juncea and to uncover the origin of the hau cms mitotype and the structural and evolutionary differences between different mitotypes.
