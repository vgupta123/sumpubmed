BACKGROUND
ephrins are ligands for transmembrane eph-receptors, the largest group of receptor tyrosine kinases, that have been shown to be implicated in various developmental mechanisms such as cell adhesion, cell migration, boundary formation, axonal pathӿnding, axon guidance, layer-speciӿc arborisations, target area, topographic mapping and apoptosis  <cit> . a total of  <dig> members have been identified to date and are divided into two sub-families consisting of  <dig> ephrina  and  <dig> ephrinb  ligand types  <cit> . ephrina and b differ in their membrane-anchorage and on their receptor affinity: ephrina are glycosylphosphatidylinositol -linked proteins and bind generally to the epha-receptors, whereas ephrinb have a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic region, and interact preferentially with ephb-receptors. exceptions in the binding discrimination between classes are that ephrina <dig>  at high concentration, can bind to ephb <dig>  <cit> , and ephrinb-ligands to epha <dig>  <cit> . ephrins and their receptors are highly expressed in the developing nervous system and often in complementary gradients inside delimited regions of the central nervous system  <cit> . this feature is particularly well described in the retinotectal system, where graded eph and ephrin expressions establish the topographically ordered retinocollicular projection: temporal retinal axons, which express high levels of epha-receptors, terminate in a low ephrin expression region of the tectum , whereas, nasal axons, which exhibit a low eph-receptor expression, connect to the posterior tectum, which is a high ephrina expression region  <cit> .

within the ephrina group, ephrina <dig> has been extensively studied and was shown to be a ligand for epha <dig>  <cit> , epha <dig>  <cit> , epha <dig>  <cit> , epha <dig>  <cit>  and ephb <dig>  <cit>  receptors. the study of its expression, mainly explored at the mrna level in the rodent developing brain, has shown that ephrina <dig> is present from early organogenesis  <cit>  to postnatal stages throughout the central nervous system. in the telencephalon, ephrina <dig> mrna is expressed in the olfactory system  <cit> , in the lateral and medial ganglionic eminences and their ventricular zones  <cit>  and in the cortex  <cit> . ephrina <dig> transcript expression has been also detected in the diencephalon   <cit>  and in the inferior and superior colliculi as well as in the pretectal nuclei and the red nucleus of the mesencephalon  <cit> .

in several systems such as the retinotectal  <cit> , the retinothalamic  <cit>  and the thalamocortical  <cit>  ones, ephrina <dig> and its receptors have been found to be expressed in opposite gradients on the projections and their target respectively, leading to a repulsive ligand-receptor interaction. an exception to these observations was described in the olfactory system, where high ephrina <dig> expressing region is connected by axons containing an important concentration of ephrina <dig> receptors. this suggests that ephrina <dig> interaction with its receptors could also mediate an attractive signal in some systems  <cit> .

although ephrina <dig> mrna expression has been extensively described during development as mentioned above, distribution of the protein in the developing central nervous system is still lacking. thereby, putative functions of this molecule during development have been mainly deduced from its mrna expression pattern and from studies using ephrina <dig> knock-out mice. however, the use of these genetic tools may present some limitations, given that, partial redundancy that exists between ephrina-ligands  <cit> .

given the importance of this guidance membrane-anchored protein location in its actions, sometimes far from the neurone soma expressing the mrna, we used here immunohistochemistry to analyse the spatiotemporal ephrina <dig> protein expression in the mouse brain during embryogenesis and in newborns. we compared the distribution of ephrina <dig> protein to the transcript location, and to previous functional studies, providing new insights to the involvement of ephrina <dig> in the development of the brain.

RESULTS
to determine the ephrina <dig> protein expression, we used an affinity purified polyclonal antibody directed against a part of the c-terminal region of the human ephrina <dig> protein, described in our previous work  <cit> . specificity of this antibody was checked comparing immunohistochemistry on sagittal sections of e <dig>  wild type and ephrina <dig> knock-out  mouse brains. no staining was detected in the ea5ko brains as shown in figure  <dig> for the parietal cortex where ephrina <dig> wild type expression is particularly high.

in wild type mice, we identified the presence of ephrina <dig> protein in the mouse brain at four stages during embryonic development: e <dig> , e <dig> , e <dig> , e <dig> , and in newborns. both sagittal and coronal sections showed dynamic spatiotemporal ephrina <dig> immunoreactivity in the telencephalic, diencephalic, mesencephalic and metencephalic brain structures. following p <dig>  the ephrina <dig> signal was barely detectable.

ephrina <dig> was expressed in the same brain regions of the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon and metencephalon from e <dig> , throughout the embryonic development until p <dig>  the intensity of staining was high from e <dig>  to e <dig>  and then decreased until p <dig> to become non-existent in p <dig> animals . the names of brain regions exhibiting a strong ephrina <dig> protein expression were underlined and highlighted in bold, whereas names of brain structures showing a moderate ephrina <dig> protein expression were only underlined. names of brain regions exhibiting weak or non-existent ephrina <dig> protein expression were not highlighted. black arrowheads indicate ephrina <dig> protein expression gradients. abbreviations: see list.

ephrina <dig> protein expression at e <dig> 
the earliest stage we examined was embryonic day e <dig>  . within the telencephalon, the olfactory nerve  presented robust ephrina <dig> immunoreactivity. well-stained cell profiles were also observed in the neocortex  and in the piriform cortex . lateral ganglionic eminence  and lateral  and medial  ganglionic eminence differentiating zones exhibited strong ephrina <dig> immunoreactivity. in these latter structures, we detected a spatial disparity of ephrina <dig> expression in a lateral and ventral  to medial and dorsal  gradient .

among the diencephalic structures, the preoptic differentiating zone , the preoptic area , as well as the hypothalamus and the ventral thalamus, visualized on coronal  and sagittal sections , also exhibited strongly labelled ephrina <dig> immunoreactive cells. we noticed spatial variations of ephrina <dig> expression within the preoptic differentiating zone, the thalamus and the hypothalamus: in the preoptic differentiating zone, ephrina <dig> was expressed in a lateral and ventral  to medial and dorsal  gradient as shown by arrowhead in figure  <dig>  panel d and in a ventral and rostral  to dorsal and caudal  gradient in the ventral thalamus and in the hypothalamus .

in the mesencephalon, only the mesencephalic tegmentum exhibited a strong level of ephrina <dig> immunoreactivity . the ventral mesencephalon was unstained .

the metencephalon was moderately stained: ephrina <dig> protein was present in the isthmus and in the cerebellum, as visualized in figure  <dig>  panel g.

overall, at e <dig> , ephrina <dig> protein was strongly expressed in the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, whereas its expression was moderate in the metencephalon .

ephrina <dig> protein expression at e <dig> 
at e <dig> , ephrina <dig> expression was strongly expressed in the four major regions of the developing brain . in the telencephalon, high level of ephrina <dig> immunoreactivity was detected, except in the olfactory bulb  and in the subventricular zone  where ephrina <dig> protein expression was moderate. strongly immunoreactive cells were observed in the neocortex, especially in the cortical plate of the primitive somatosensory cortex  and in the piriform cortex . ephrina <dig> immunoreactivity was also robust in the lateral ganglionic eminence, visualized on coronal  and sagittal sections , in a lateral and ventral  to medial and caudal  gradient  and in a ventral and rostral  to dorsal and caudal  gradient .

in the diencephalon, ephrina <dig> was strongly expressed in the preoptic area  and in the ventral thalamus, visualized on coronal  and on sagittal sections in a ventral and rostral  to dorsal and caudal  gradient . we also observed a high ephrina <dig> staining in the subthalamic area  and moderate immunoreactivity in the hypothalamus .

in the mesencephalon, coronal  and sagittal  sections in the mesencephalic tegmentum exhibited robust ephrina <dig> immunoreactivity. furthermore, ephrina <dig> was strongly expressed in the inferior and superior colliculi  and in the pretectum . we observed a lateral and ventral  to medial and dorsal  gradient in the pretectum  and a lateral  to medial  gradient in the inferior colliculus . the commissure of superior colliculus  also presented robust ephrina <dig> immunoreactivity. in return, the ventral mesencephalon was unstained .

in the metencephalon, cells from the isthmus differentiating zone were weakly stained , whereas the cerebellar vermis exhibited a strong ephrina <dig> expression .

finally, we noticed that cells from the neuroepithelia of the third  and fourth  ventricles and of the aqueduct  exhibited strong ephrina <dig> immunoreactivity.

overall, ephrina <dig> protein was strongly expressed in the same brain regions than earlier in the development. the olfactory bulb, the subventricular zone, the hypothalamus and the isthmus differentiating zone were however moderately stained .

ephrina <dig> protein expression at e <dig> 
at e <dig> , the intensity of ephrina <dig> immunostaining was high in most of the developing brain structures . the telencephalon exhibited strong ephrina <dig> expression in olfactory structures such as the granule  and the mitral  cell layers of the olfactory bulb, the olfactory tubercle  and the lateral olfactory tract . we also detected a high level of ephrina <dig> immunoreactivity in the septum  and in the lateral ganglionic eminence, as visualized on coronal  and sagittal sections . within the lateral ganglionic eminence, ephrina <dig> was expressed in a ventral and rostral  to dorsal and caudal  gradient . moreover, the frontal  and parietal  parts of the neocortex exhibited a strong ephrina <dig> protein expression in the marginal zone, the cortical plate and the subplate as observed in the primitive somatosensory cortex . insular , retrosplenial  and piriform  cortices also exhibited ephrina <dig> immunoreactive cells, although these two latter structures showed less intense immunostaining. ephrina <dig> protein expression was moderate in the hippocampus .

in the diencephalon, ephrina <dig> staining in the preoptic area  was moderate compared to previous stages, whereas the thalamus, visualized on coronal  and sagittal sections , still exhibited strong ephrina <dig> expression. in this structure, ephrina <dig> staining was higher in the ventral and rostral part than in the dorsal and caudal part . an intense staining was also detected in the hypothalamus .

in the mesencephalon, the mesencephalic tegmentum  and the superior colliculus  exhibited strongly immunostained cells. ephrina <dig> labeling was also detected in the ventricular zone of the inferior colliculus in a caudal  to rostral  gradient . the ventral mesencephalon was unstained .

in the metencephalon, the isthmus was moderately stained  whereas high immunoreactivity in the cerebellum  and in the pons  was detected.

neuroepithelia of the third  and fourth  ventricles and neuroepithelium of the aqueduct  exhibited ephrina <dig> immunostaining as well.

moreover, to specify retinocollicular mapping, we tested the expression of ephrina <dig> protein in the retina. immunohistochemistry localized ephrina <dig> protein in the nasal part of the retina and the retinal ganglion cell layer .

overall, e <dig>  embryonic stage showed high levels of ephrina <dig> immunoreactivity in the same regions than those previously described earlier in the development, with the exception of the preoptic area that was moderately stained compared to e <dig>  and e <dig>  stages .

ephrina <dig> protein expression at e <dig> 
at e <dig> , ephrina <dig> protein expression was generally less intense than earlier in the development . in the telencephalon, the granule cell layer of the olfactory bulb , the olfactory tubercle and the lateral olfactory tract  exhibited a moderate immunoreactive intensity. moreover, ephrina <dig> expression was weak in the striatum as shown on coronal  and sagittal sections , and almost non-existent in the nucleus accumbens . a moderate ephrina <dig> expression was detected in the septum in a lateral and ventral  to medial and dorsal  gradient  and in the lateral migratory stream . the piriform , insular , cingulate , including the retrosplenial cortex , and the frontal cortex  exhibited weak staining intensity. moderate intensity of ephrina <dig> expression was observed in the perirhinal cortex , in layers i and v in the occipital cortex  and in the primary somatosensory region of the parietal cortex . in the hippocampus, weak immunostaining was localized in the ca <dig> and ca <dig> regions, and in the dentate gyrus .

in diencephalic structures, ephrina <dig> expression was moderate in the thalamus, with the strongest immunoreactivity in the dorsal part, contrary to the previous stages, thus leading to a lateral and dorsal  to medial and ventral  gradient . weakly stained cells were detected in the hypothalamus .

in the mesencephalon, the commissure of the superior colliculus , the mesencephalic tegmentum  and the superior and inferior colliculi  exhibited ephrina <dig> immunoreactive cells. ephrina <dig> expression was however stronger in the inferior part of the colliculus than in the superior region, exhibiting a lateral  to medial  gradient . the ventral mesencephalon was unstained .

in the metencephalon, the cerebellum and the pons were weakly stained .

finally, cells from the neuroepithelia of the third  and fourth  ventricles, and the neuroepithelium of the aqueduct  exhibited high immunoreactivity.

ephrina <dig> protein expression at p0
in newborn mice, ephrina <dig> expression intensity was dramatically decreased in all regions of the brain, compared to the previous stage e <dig>  . in the telencephalon, we were however able to detect weakly stained cells in the olfactory structures: the granule cell layer , the olfactory subventricular zone , the olfactory tubercle , and the lateral olfactory tract . moreover, ephrina <dig> immunoreactive cells were observed in the subventricular zone , in the striatum , and in the nucleus accumbens . in the striatum, we detected a discrete ephrina <dig> expression gradient from the lateral and ventral  to the medial and dorsal  parts . moderate ephrina <dig> staining was observed in the septum  whereas the parietal , the frontal  and the retrosplenial  cortices exhibited weak ephrina <dig> protein expression. the hippocampus , the piriform, the occipital and the perirhinal cortices were unstained .

within the diencephalic structures, a very weak ephrina <dig> signal was present in the dorsal and in the ventral part of the thalamus . the hypothalamus expressed moderate ephrina <dig> protein expression level .

in the mesencephalon, the mesencephalic tegmentum  exhibited weakly immunostained cells as well as the superior  and inferior  colliculi. in the inferior colliculus, we however detected a caudal  to rostral  gradient . the commissure of superior colliculus exhibited moderate ephrina <dig> immunoreactivity .

within the metencephalon, weak ephrina <dig> immunoreactivity was detected in the cerebellum .

ventricles and sylvius aqueduct's neuroepithelia were unstained .

overall, at p <dig>  ephrina <dig> protein expression decreased in all brain regions compared to previous stages. the strongest ephrina <dig> protein expression was found in the septum, in the hypothalamus and in the commissure of superior colliculus, although these protein expression levels were still moderate compared to the earliest developmental stages .

following p <dig>  ephrina <dig> expression was barely detectable.

discussion
the present work describes for the first time, the distribution of ephrina <dig> protein in the embryonic developing mouse brain. ephrina <dig> protein expression appeared to be dynamic and complex, and particularly high from e <dig>  to e <dig>  in the olfactory bulb, the cortex, the lge/striatum, the thalamus, and the colliculus. its expression generally decreased from e <dig>  to become very weak at p <dig> and extinct at p <dig> , contrary to the mrna level that stays elevated in the newborn  <cit> . in spite of this graded decrease, ephrina <dig> protein expression at p <dig> was still observed in the same regions of the brain than at earlier stages . as primary molecular events in topographic map formation occur between e <dig> and p <dig> in the mouse  <cit> , this suggests that high ephrina <dig> expression during embryogenesis, may participate in early target connection mechanisms, whereas ephrina <dig> may be implicated to a lesser extent in map remodelling process during the first postnatal week. this transient expression during embryonic development is in line with early axon guidance and topographic mapping in the olfactory, the retinotectal, the thalamocortical, the corticothalamic and the mesostriatal systems. this indicates multiple functions of this molecule in the establishment of these systems, as discussed in the following sections.

central olfactory system
to the best of our knowledge, the olfactory system is the only brain system, in which ephrina <dig> expression has been studied at the protein level, using immunohistochemistry  <cit> . our study is complementary to this one as it brings new data especially concerning the expression of the protein in the secondary olfactory neuron population.

olfaction initiates in the nasal neuroepithelium where primary olfactory neurons reside, each one encoding a single odour receptor type  <cit> . these neurons send axons, forming the olfactory nerve and project to the olfactory bulb in the rostro-ventral telencephalon, where they sort out and target specific glomeruli. glomeruli are designed as contact zone between growth cones of the primary olfactory neurons and dendrites of secondary olfactory neurons, known as mitral and tufted cells located in the olfactory bulb  <cit> . primary olfactory neurons, mitral and tufted cells are neurons supporting early synaptic relays of the mouse olfactory system and so arise in a relatively parallel fashion between e <dig>  and e <dig>   <cit> . in our study, we showed for the first time that the olfactory nerve expressed ephrina <dig> in early embryogenesis , suggesting either an involvement of this molecule in the guidance of primary olfactory neurons into the olfactory bulb or, an implication of ephrina <dig> in the fasciculation of primary olfactory axons inside the olfactory nerve, possibly through an interaction with epha4- and/or epha5-receptors, shown to be expressed during embryogenesis in the olfactory nerve  <cit> .

interestingly, we found that ephrina <dig> was expressed in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, transiently during embryogenesis, at e <dig> . the function of this molecule at this precise stage is still unclear but it may be implicated in the positioning of the mitral cell layer in the olfactory bulb. indeed, ephrins are known to be involved in cell migration and boundary formation in other nervous systems  <cit> , and at this stage the cell body of developing mitral cells appears to transform from tangential to radial orientation with rearrangement of its microtubules structure  <cit> . moreover, the presence of potential ephrina <dig> receptors such as epha <dig>  <cit> , ephb <dig>  <cit> , epha <dig>  <cit> , epha <dig> and epha <dig>  <cit>  has been also described in the mitral cells during embryogenesis. this suggests that ephrina <dig> and its receptors are not expressed in complementary gradient as it has been described for other systems such as the retinotectal one  <cit> . instead, we showed that ephrina <dig> is uniformly expressed in this structure as for its receptors  <cit> . this ligand-receptor interaction may result in an attraction of the cells, thus regulating the connections of mitral cells. indeed, this mechanism has already been demonstrated in the accessory olfactory system, where axons expressing high levels of ephrina <dig> project to regions of the accessory olfactory bulb that express high levels of epha <dig>  suggesting that epha6-ephrina <dig> interaction promotes adhesion or attraction between first and second order accessory neurones  <cit> .

later during embryogenesis, the mitral cells leave the olfactory bulb in the lateral olfactory tract, which synapses on five major regions of the mature telencephalon including the olfactory tubercle and the piriform cortex that project to the thalamus. we detected the expression of ephrina <dig> protein from e <dig>  on in the lateral olfactory tract and the olfactory tubercle. this expression was strong at e <dig> , slightly diminished at e <dig>  and became very weak at p <dig>  suggesting that this molecule may be involved in the secondary olfactory neuron guidance, since its presence is concomitant to the development of this telencephalic pathway  <cit> . ephrina <dig> expression in the lateral olfactory tract and olfactory tubercle may also have a role in the fasciculation of axons inside these structures, since fasciculation can be regulated by manipulating chemorepulsive interactions mediated by eph receptors  <cit> . as axon pathfinding in olfactory map formation has been mainly investigated when primary olfactory axons enter the olfactory bulb glomeruli  <cit> , our data give new insights concerning the guidance of the secondary mitral cell axons onto the thalamus.

finally, we detected the presence of ephrina <dig> protein in the piriform cortex at e <dig> , earlier than the expression of this protein in the mitral cells and in the lateral olfactory tract that appeared at e <dig> . this ephrina <dig> expression in the piriform cortex dramatically decreased from e <dig> , when the secondary olfactory axons connect this target  <cit> . this suggests that ephrina <dig> protein expression in the piriform cortex during early embryogenesis may not be related to the connection of the axons of the lateral olfactory tract, but rather may play a role in the formation of the piriform cortex architecture.

visual system
expression of ephrina <dig> transcript has been extensively studied in this system and especially in the retinocollicular topographic mapping  <cit> . we investigated ephrina <dig> protein expression in the retina and detected a high expression in the nasal part compared to the temporal one. this result is in accordance with the previously described retinal ephrina <dig> expression pattern in the chick  <cit>  and with ephrina <dig> mrna expression found in a high-nasal-to-low-temporal gradient in the developing mouse embryo retina  <cit> . as previously described, the mouse retinal ganglion cells also expressed epha <dig> and epha <dig> receptors  <cit> . this suggests that ephrina <dig> protein may be co-expressed with these molecules and interact in cis or in trans then modulating the tectum or colliculus connectivity. indeed, several studies confirmed the role of axonally expressed ephrina ligands in the development of the retinotectal projection  <cit> . however, whether growth cones switch between cis and trans configuration or cis and trans configurations occur in parallel in the same growth cone, is still unclear.

as our findings in the retina, the results of our analysis in the central visual system were generally consistent with the findings of the past surveys describing the mrna distribution of ephrina <dig> in the  <dig> main targets of retinal ganglion cell axons: the thalamus, the pretectum, and the superior colliculus. indeed, we showed that ephrina <dig> protein is strongly expressed in these structures especially from e <dig>  to e <dig>  , when the axons of the optic tracts reach their final destinations in the superior colliculus at e <dig>  <cit> , and in the thalamic dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei at e <dig>  <cit> . this is in accordance with an implication of ephrina <dig> in the topographic mapping of the visual connections especially in the superior colliculus  <cit> . it has to be noticed however, that ephrina <dig> mrna expression was described as soon as e <dig>  in the developing superior colliculus  <cit> , whereas we did not detect ephrina <dig> protein in this structure earlier than e <dig> . this suggests that ephrina <dig> may be implicated in this topographic mapping only from e <dig> , when the retinal connections reach the superior colliculus. on the contrary, in the thalamus and in the mesencephalic tegmentum, ephrina <dig> protein level was elevated from e <dig>  onwards. this expression seems to be too precocious to involve ephrina <dig> in visual connection mapping and more probably may be implicated in the formation of other systems involving the thalamus, such as the thalamocortical system as discussed below, and the mesencephalic tegmentum, such as the rubrospinal system.

the general high ephrina <dig> expression during embryogenesis, may highlight a role for ephrina <dig> in the initial diffuse projection when retinal ganglion cells substantially overshoot their appropriate target by e <dig> along the antero-posterior axis of the superior colliculus  <cit>  and at a lesser extent later on, when map remodelling occur during the first postnatal week.

ephrina <dig> rna is known to be expressed in a caudal  to rostral  gradient in the mouse superior colliculus  <cit> . this gradient is thought to be at the basis of the chemorepellent action of ephrina <dig> on retinal ganglion cell's axons arising from the nasal part of the retina  <cit> . however, at the protein level, ephrina <dig> expression was homogenous in the superior colliculus without any detectable expression gradient. as suggested by greferath et al.  <cit>  concerning epha <dig> receptor expression in the striatum, this may be due to the fact that the antibody localizes ephrina <dig> protein in both cell bodies and axons bundles, whereas rnas are concentrated in the cell somas. moreover, studies describing the epha <dig> protein expression in the developing mouse  <cit>  did not detect any protein gradient expression.

among studies exploring the expression of epha-receptors at the protein level in the developing mouse brain, some showed that the potential ephrina <dig> receptors epha <dig> and epha <dig>  are expressed in the central visual system: epha <dig> protein is present in the thalamus and superior colliculus from e <dig> to p6; and in the pretectal nucleus from e <dig> to p <dig>  <cit> . epha <dig> protein is expressed in the geniculate nucleus of the thalamus from e <dig> as well as in the pretectum and the superior colliculus from e <dig> to e <dig>  <cit> . together with our present work, these findings suggest a concomitant expression of ephrina <dig> with  epha <dig> and epha <dig> in the superior colliculus,  epha <dig> in the thalamus and  epha <dig> in the pretectum. moreover, a detailed analysis of protein gradients inside these regions may help to understand their interactions and their chemorepulsive or chemoattractive actions. however, it is unlikely that the co-expression of ligand and receptor in the same region of the visual system is responsible of an attractive mechanism, since it has been extensively shown, using in vitro studies and double ephrina2/ephrina <dig> knock-out mice  <cit> , that the topographic map of the visual system is established by a chemorepellent activity of ephrinas  <cit> . nevertheless, it may be that ligands and receptors are present on the same cells, as it has been shown in the chick retinal ganglion cells, where ephrina <dig>  ephrina <dig> and epha <dig> mrna are co-expressed  <cit> . in this case, the presence of ephrina-ligand on the retinal ganglion cells could control the epha-receptor function through a modulation of its intracellular signalling pathway  <cit>  as discussed above.

cortex and thalamocortical projections
we detected ephrina <dig> protein in the developing cortex from e <dig>  to e <dig>  with an expression pattern becoming more complex as cortical layers were forming. we found a particularly strong signal at e <dig>  in the primitive primary somatosensory cortex , when thalamic axons reach the subplate zone. this is consistent with the presence of ephrina <dig> mrna in the subplate and cortical plate of s <dig> at this stage  <cit> . indeed, ephrina <dig> is thought to interact with and repulse ventrobasal thalamic terminal arbors expressing epha <dig>  and to be responsible for the precise topographic mapping of thalamic afferents into s <dig>  <cit> . moreover, we showed a strong ephrina <dig> protein expression in other regions of the developing cortex, especially in the parietal, frontal and insular cortices at e <dig> , suggesting that ephrina <dig> may be involved in the refinement of other thalamocortical projections and probably through an interaction with  <dig> potential receptors: epha <dig>  epha <dig> and/or epha <dig> that have been detected in these regions during mouse embryogenesis. indeed, epha <dig> protein is expressed in the cortical plate and cortical intermediate zone from e <dig> to p <dig>  especially in thalamocortical axons  <cit> . epha <dig> protein is expressed from e <dig> to p <dig> in the developing cortex  <cit> , and epha <dig> protein is present in the intermediate zone and cortical plate  <cit>  whereas its transcript is expressed in the dorsal and medial thalamus that connect to the developing cortex  <cit> , suggesting an expression of epha <dig> protein in the thalamocortical projections.

thalamus and corticothalamic projections
previous studies showed different patterns of ephrina <dig> mrna expression, depending of the thalamic nuclei and the stage observed: at e <dig> , bolz et al.  <cit>  described a weak mrna expression in the ventricular zone of the dorsal thalamus at the caudal level with no detectable expression in the mid- or rostral levels of the dorsal thalamus. feldheim et al.  <cit>  described ephrina <dig> mrna expression from e <dig> , in the dorsal and ventral lateral geniculate nuclei in a ventral, lateral and anterior  to dorsal, medial and posterior  gradient. between e <dig>  and e <dig> , nuclei of the lateral part of the dorsal thalamus  <cit>  and ventral nuclei  <cit>  both exhibit ephrina <dig> mrna. our results partially match with these previous studies, as we showed here that ephrina <dig> protein was strongly expressed in the thalamus in a ventral and rostral  to dorsal and caudal  gradient especially from e <dig>  to e <dig> . interestingly, we observed that this gradient inverted from e <dig> , when cortical axons connect the thalamus  <cit> . this is consistent with an implication of ephrina <dig> in the corticothalamic projection establishment as proposed by torii and levitt  <cit>  who hypothesized that the corticothalamic projections are directed by ephrina-epha signalling and more precisely that axons from sensory cortex find a precise target in the thalamus by responding to local levels of ephrina <dig>  in this region, ephrina <dig> may interact with epha <dig> protein, described in the thalamus from e <dig>  to postnatal stages  <cit>  to ensure the formation of terminal corticothalamic arbors.

mesostriatal system
ephrina <dig> protein was strongly expressed in the main target structure of the ventral mesencephalic axons: the lateral ganglionic eminence and later in development, the striatum. as described for mrna levels  <cit> , this expression was high from e <dig>  to e <dig>  and then diminished later in development. we observed a graduated ephrina <dig> protein expression in a ventral and rostral  to a dorsal and caudal  gradient that was not spatially concordant with the ephrina <dig> rna expression, described as not graded in developing striatum  <cit> . as we discussed in a previous work, it is likely that the presence of this ephrina <dig> protein expression gradient helps mesencephalic neuron subpopulations to differentially connect the dorsal and ventral parts of the striatum during development  <cit> .

no ephrina <dig> protein was detected in the ventral mesencephalon from e <dig>  to p <dig>  suggesting that this protein was present exclusively at the target site of the mesotriatal projections, when the mesencephalic axons reach the lge  <cit> . this strongly suggests that ephrina <dig> may be involved in the refinement of mesencephalic arbors in the striatum especially by interacting with epha <dig>  expressed in the lge between e <dig> and e <dig>  <cit>  and in the ventral mesencephalon in the dopaminergic mesencephalic cells projecting to the lge  <cit> . finally, the implication of ephrina <dig> in the mesencephalic projections onto the striatum is in accordance with previous work showing that disruption of epha/ephrina interactions resulted in the mistargeting of a fraction of mesencephalic dopaminergic projections  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we provide the first detailed description of ephrina <dig> protein distribution in the embryonic developing mouse brain. we found that ephrina <dig> is strongly expressed from e <dig>  to e <dig> , in the olfactory bulb, the cortex, the striatum, the thalamus, and the colliculi, suggesting its implication in topographic mapping of olfactory, retinotectal, thalamocortical, corticothalamic and mesostriatal systems. these new data may help to characterise the molecular basis of pathfinding of these systems, during development. moreover, given the importance of developmental processes in brain repair, these results may open new tracks in the improvement of pathway restoration following cell transplantation in the damaged brain.
