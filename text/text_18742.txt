BACKGROUND
insulin resistance  is a state during which a higher than normal insulin level is required for glucose homeostasis. ir occurs in the periphery and in the brain, where it has recently been linked to the hyperphosphorylation of the neuronal cytoskeleton protein tau  <cit> , which is symptomatic for alzheimer’s neurodegeneration. after the glucose homeostasis is disturbed, an increase in the glucose level indicates the onset of type- <dig> diabetes .

in several clinical studies, t2d was found to increase the risk of alzheimer’s disease   <cit> . in the postmortem brains of both t2d and sporadic ad patients, central resistance to insulin was documented by attenuated insulin signaling, namely via a decreased phosphorylation of the insulin cascade kinases pdk <dig> , akt , and gsk-3β , and this effect was more pronounced in patients with both t2d and ad  <cit> . gsk-3β acts as both the insulin cascade kinase and the primary kinase phosphorylating tau  <cit> . the phosphorylation of ser <dig> in gsk-3β by akt inhibits the kinase activity of gsk-3β  <cit> , and the attenuated phosphorylation of ser <dig> logically increases the kinase activity of gsk-3β toward tau. central insulin resistance is linked to a hyperphosphorylation of tau through gsk-3β  <cit> .

severe hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, as well as the hyperphosphorylation of ser199/ <dig>  thr <dig>  and ser <dig> in tau, were found to increase progressively with age in the hippocampi of db/db mice with impaired leptin receptor signaling, a rodent model of t2d  <cit> . an augmented phosphorylation of ser <dig> in the hippocampal tau of db/db mice was later confirmed by another research team  <cit> . however, in whole-brain samples of db/db mice with fully developed t2d, changes in the insulin receptors and gsk-3β phosphorylation were not found  <cit> .

similar to db/db mice, zucker fatty fa/fa rats have a genetically homozygous leptin receptor mutation that results in leptin dysfunction. zucker fa/fa rats suffer from obesity induced by hyperphagia, severe hyperlipidemia, and hyperinsulinemia, resulting in ir in the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue . the ir in fa/fa rats is established prior to adulthood, at the age of 7 weeks  <cit> . unlike db/db mice, fa/fa rats are normoglycemic or have only slightly elevated glucose levels and do not develop diabetes  <cit> .

in this study, insulin signaling and tau phosphorylation were followed in the hippocampi of 12-  and 33-week-old  obese zucker fa/fa rats and their lean controls to verify the hypothesis that peripheral insulin resistance resulting from obesity and/or old age represents a risk factor for central insulin resistance and that such possible central ir is linked to the pathologic phosphorylation of tau protein. in short, we aimed to determine whether ir with hyperinsulinemia but normoglycemia is associated with a risk of tau protein pathology in the hippocampus.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
this study revealed attenuated insulin signaling and increased hyperphosphorylation of tau  in the hippocampi of fa/fa rats exhibiting peripheral insulin resistance or advanced age.

both the fa/fa rats in this study and the db/db mice in a previous work  <cit>  exhibited impaired leptin signaling, hyperinsulinemia and blood insulin levels approximately 10-fold higher than the normal values. these data indicate that peripheral insulin resistance developed at an early age  in the db/db mice and the fa/fa rats, respectively. ir in the fa/fa rats was indirectly demonstrated using the quicki test. dyslipidemia in the fa/fa rats could be linked to peripheral ir.

the fa/fa rats were normoglycemic even at an advanced age , whereas 8-week-old db/db mice had glucose levels double those of the control db + mice  <cit> . glucose or glucosamine availability is considered to determine the degree of glcnacylation of the serines and threonines in the tau protein that can be phosphorylated  <cit> . the attenuation of glcnacylation in favor of the augmented phosphorylation of the tau protein has been described as a possible mechanism of tau pathology . on the other hand, healthy mice deprived of food for one to three days  exhibited reversible phosphorylation of hippocampal tau ser <dig>  <cit> . the fa/fa rats in the present study exhibited an obvious increase in the hyperphosphorylation of hippocampal tau protein in the normoglycemic state. this finding supports the hypothesis that insulin ineffectiveness, rather than extreme glucose levels, is linked to tau hyperphosphorylation.

in this study, the obese rats had significantly reduced hippocampal levels of insulin receptor and pi <dig> kinase protein. statistically significantly attenuated phosphorylation of both akt thr <dig> and ser <dig> was detected in old-age rats, and this effect was more pronounced in fa/fa rats. a similar trend was found for the phosphorylation of ser <dig> in gsk3/β. gsk-3β, a kinase common in insulin cascading and tau phosphorylation, is constitutively active in resting neurons, and its activity is negatively affected by ser <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . gsk-3β is the primary tau kinase that hyperphosphorylates tau , with ser <dig>  thr <dig>  ser <dig>  and ser <dig> as the predominant targets  <cit> . cavallini et al.  <cit>  identified gsk-3β and also gsk-3α and mapk <dig> as the most active out of  <dig> kinases overexpressing both tau kinases and tau protein  <cit> . besides akt and gsk-3β, extracellular signal-regulated kinase , is involved both in insulin signaling and tau phosphorylation. however, there were found no differences in erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation between the groups in this study .

the ser <dig> and thr <dig> phosphorylations investigated in this study are essential in tau protein pathology for the following reasons. ser <dig> is directly phosphorylated by gsk-3β without priming   <cit> . moreover, a positive relationship between the phosphorylation of tau ser <dig> in the cerebrospinal fluid and the severity of the disease was found in ad patients  <cit> . additionally, nirco  mice without insulin receptors in brain neurons showed an increase in the phosphorylation of tau thr <dig>  which resulted from the attenuated phosphorylation of akt ser <dig> and gsk-3β ser <dig>  <cit> . cavallini et al.  <cit>  specified the main phosphorylation sites of tau as ser <dig>  thr <dig>  ser <dig>  and ser396/ <dig>  in addition to ser <dig> and thr <dig>  we examined tau phosphorylation at ser212/ <dig> and ser  <dig> in all the groups, but the results were inconsistent.

inefficient leptin signaling in fa/fa rats could contribute to tau hyperphosphorylation because leptin has been reported to prevent tau phosphorylation in neuronal cells via the activation of amp-dependent kinase  <cit> . this process was later found to be stress dependent  <cit> , making its role in tau pathology unclear.

this study demonstrated that the phosphorylation of ser <dig> and thr <dig> in hippocampal tau was related to the fa/fa obese phenotype; an interaction with the rats’ age was found for ser <dig> only. analogously, in the hippocampi of db/db mice with non-functioning leptin receptors and severe ir, tau phosphorylation at ser 199/ <dig>  thr <dig>  and ser <dig> was found to progress with age. unfortunately, the previous study of db/db mice  <cit>  did not provide data on hippocampal insulin signaling.

in a human study  <cit> , attenuated insulin signaling was inversely correlated with increased tau hyperphosphorylation in the frontal cortex of t2d patients, and this correlation was more pronounced in t2d patients with ad co-morbidity. however, data on insulin, glucose, and lipid levels were not accessible because of postmortem sampling. nevertheless, both impaired insulin signaling and tau hyperphosphorylation in the brain were obvious in both the human study  <cit>  and this rat study.

peripheral ir in old-age rats appeared to result in central insulin resistance and tau hyperprotein phosphorylation in the hippocampus. this effect was more pronounced in obese fa/fa rats, which are prone to obesity-induced ir. based on the normoglycemic state of the ir fa/fa rats, we conclude that a pre-t2d state with ir and normoglycemia is associated with an increased risk of central pathological ir and tau phosphorylation. the precise mechanism and the role of leptin signaling should be elucidated.
