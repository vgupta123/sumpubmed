BACKGROUND
cell protrusions are dynamic and morphologically varied extensions of the plasma membrane, supported by the actin cytoskeleton, that are essential for cell migration. fascin- <dig> is a prominent actin-bundling protein that characterizes the filopodia, microspikes, and dendrites of mesenchymal, neuronal, and dendritic cells, respectively, and also contributes to filopodia, podosomes, and invadopodia in migratory vascular smooth muscle cells and cancer cells  <cit> . fascin- <dig> is absent from most normal adult epithelia, yet is upregulated in human carcinomas arising from a number of tissues. there is evidence that fascin- <dig> supports the migratory and metastatic capacities of carcinomas  <cit> . fascin- <dig> is an independent indicator of poor prognosis in non-small-cell lung carcinomas and colorectal, breast, and other carcinomas  <cit> . in colon, breast, or prostate carcinomas, fascin- <dig> protein correlates with increased frequency of metastasis  <cit> . fascin- <dig> is thought to be the target of macroketone, which is under investigation as an anti-cancer agent  <cit> . for these reasons, identification of the signaling pathways that regulate fascin- <dig> in carcinoma cells has become an important focus of research.

actin bundling has been shown in vitro to be a conserved activity of fascins  <cit> . in filopodia, fascin- <dig> molecules crosslink actin filaments into parallel bundles, yet also move dynamically in and out of the bundle, which may allow for bundle turning and bending  <cit> . f-actin cross linking by fascin- <dig> involves the n-terminal and c- terminal domains of fascin- <dig>  and a major mechanism that inhibits the actin-bundling activity of fascin- <dig> is the phosphorylation of an n-terminal motif  by conventional isoforms of protein kinase c   <cit> . cpkc phosphorylation of s <dig> inhibits actin binding and drives the formation of a complex between phosphorylated fascin- <dig> and active cpkc, resulting in a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution of fascin- <dig>  <cit> . in migrating carcinoma cells, fascin- <dig> and cpkc associate dynamically in filopodia and at cell edges, and the cycling of phosphorylated fascin- <dig> is necessary for directional cell migration and experimental metastasis  <cit> . rac <dig> is a major upstream regulator of both these activities of fascin-1; it promotes the bundling of f-actin by fascin- <dig> in lamellipodia  <cit> , and drives the formation of a complex between phosphorylated fascin- <dig> and active cpkc, through a pathway involving group i p21-activated kinases  <cit> .

effective cell migration depends on integration of the f-actin cytoskeleton of protrusions with the contractile actomyosin stress fibers in the cell body  <cit> . the molecular basis of this integration is not well understood, but fascin- <dig> is known to associate with stress fibers under conditions associated with moderate extracellular matrix  adhesion, such as on mixed thrombospondin-1/fibronectin  surfaces or under conditions of partial impairment of cell spreading on fn caused by a function-pertubing antibody to α <dig> integrin  <cit> . in fish keratocyes, fascin-containing filopodia contribute actin filament bundles into myosin ii-containing stress fibers or fold back to incorporate into lamellipodial f-actin arcs  <cit> . the small guanine triphosphatase  rho is a major regulator of cell contractility that acts antagonistically to rac in several cellular pathways  <cit> . but whether rho regulates fascin- <dig> is unknown. several lines of evidence indicate functional links between fascin- <dig> protrusions and the contractile focal adhesions that are promoted by active rho; the phosphofascin-1/cpkc complex regulates the balance between protrusions and focal adhesions in mesenchymal cells, and depletion of fascin- <dig> from colon carcinoma cells inhibits focal adhesion disassembly and prevents filopodia formation  <cit> . whether rho participates in these processes is unknown. although overexpression of constitutively active rho alters fascin- <dig> localization in quiescent fibroblasts, dominant-negative rho does not inhibit the long-lived fascin- <dig> protrusions of cells adherent on thrombospondin- <dig>  <cit> . tenascin-c, another ecm glycoprotein that activates assembly of fascin- <dig> protrusions, suppresses rho activity in fibroblasts by a syndecan- <dig> dependent pathway  <cit> .

in this study, we investigated the hypothesis that fascin- <dig> is a functional target of rho and identified a pathway from rho via rho kinases to p-lin-11/isl-1/mec- <dig> kinases  <dig> and limk <dig>  we found that limk1/ <dig> is a novel positive regulator of the fascin-1/actin interaction and is a novel interaction partner of fascin- <dig>  these data have important implications for consideration of the role of fascin- <dig> in carcinoma metastasis.

RESULTS
rhoa supports the interaction of fascin- <dig> with actin in migrating cells
to investigate the novel hypothesis that rho activity regulates fascin- <dig>  we used two cell systems: mouse c2c <dig> skeletal myoblasts and human sw <dig> colon carcinoma cells. in both of these cell types, fascin-1-containing protrusions are known to be important for ecm-dependent cytoskeletal reorganizations and cell migration  <cit> . c2c <dig> mouse skeletal myoblasts adherent on fn undergo transient ruffling during attachment and spreading, followed by strong phosphorylation and complexing of fascin- <dig> with conventional pkc as focal adhesions assemble and then stabilize  <cit> . thus, after  <dig> hour of adhesion to fn, fascin- <dig> has a diffuse distribution, and there are few fascin-1-positive cell protrusions . in c2c <dig> cells treated with bisindolylmaleimide i  to inhibit cpkc, fascin- <dig> was increased in bundles at cell edges and was also aligned with stress fibers, confirming that pkc-dependent phosphorylation antagonizes the actin-bundling capacity of fascin- <dig>  <cit>  .

fn-adherent c2c <dig> cells have significant levels of endogenous active rho-guanine triphosphate  relative to cells adherent to thrombospondin- <dig> . under conditions of rho inhibition by c <dig> exotoxin, c2c <dig> cells adherent to fn have irregular shapes, with increased fascin- <dig> bundles at cell edges . these observations were confirmed by scoring the numbers of peripheral fascin-containing bundles in adherent cells. bim or c <dig> treatments increased the number of bundles, but did not alter the lengths of bundles containing fascin- <dig> . increased association of fascin- <dig> with microfilament bundles within the cell body was also seen in many c3-treated cells . the effects of bim and c <dig> were confirmed in sw <dig> colon carcinoma cells undergoing rac-dependent migration on laminin  by mechanisms previously identified to depend functionally on fascin-1-dependent filopodia, dynamic fascin/pkc complexing, and focal adhesion turnover  <cit> . bim treatment of sw <dig> cells on ln resulted in more irregular morphologies with non-polarized formation of fascin-1-positive protrusions at cell margins . sw <dig> typically contain relatively few stress fibers, and the effects of c <dig> on fascin- <dig> relocalization to cell edges was less pronounced in these cells . rho activity in migrating sw <dig> cells and its effective inhibition by c <dig> exotoxin was confirmed by measurement of rhoa activity under the different experimental conditions . together, these data implicate rho activity in regulation of the dynamic balance of fascin- <dig> interactions with f-actin.

to obtain precise evidence that rho activity can regulate fascin- <dig>  we tested the effect of rho inhibition on the interaction of fascin- <dig> with actin, using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy  to measure fluorescence resonance energy transfer . the abundance of actin in cells, coupled with issues of the conformational availability of fluorophores, has so far hindered attempts to measure interactions between fluorescently-tagged actin and its binding partners by fret/flim. thus, to measure the fascin-1/actin interaction directly, we took a novel approach, using green fluorescent protein -tagged lifeact as the fret donor. lifeact is a peptide of  <dig> amino acids, which is derived from yeast, and binds specifically and reversibly to f-actin in live cells without interfering with actin dynamics  <cit> . to set up conditions to measure the fascin-1/actin interaction without modulation or interference by dynamic fascin- <dig> phosphorylation, we used as the fret acceptor in these experiments a fascin- <dig> mutant, fascin-1s39a, which binds actin but does not interact with cpkc  <cit> , the monomeric red fluorescent protein -tagged fascin-1s39a showed strong fret with gfp-lifeact in both fn-adherent c2c <dig> cells and sw <dig> cells on ln ; figure 2c shows quantification from multiple cells). fret efficiency between gfp-lifeact and mrfp-fascin1s39a was strong at the cell peripheries and was also often detected in cell bodies . the interaction of phosphomimetic mrfp-fascin-1s39d was minimal, with the gfp fluorescence lifetime comparable with that of cells expressing gfp-lifeact alone . to confirm that the gfp-lifeact results were an accurate reflection of the distribution of f-actin in cells, cells co-expressing gfp-lifeact and mrfp-fascin1s39a were co-stained with phalloidin to visualize total f-actin, and then analyzed by flim. analysis of the cell edges showed that the highest gfp-lifeact signals were found within areas with the highest intensity of phalloidin staining, thus corresponding to concentrations of f-actin , and mrfp-fascin- <dig> was similarly distributed . the areas of highest fret efficiency occurred within the areas of highest intensity phalloidin staining, and overlapped partially with the concentrations of gfp-lifeact . thus, the fret/flim interaction accurately reflects the portion of total f-actin that is involved in fascin- <dig> binding.

as expected from the initial experiments , treatment with bim or c <dig> resulted in altered cell morphologies . c3-treated c2c <dig> cells typically showed reduction of actin stress fibers within cell bodies . bim treatment did not prevent the fascin-1s39a/lifeact fret/flim interaction, confirming the independence of this interaction from cpkc activity . in both cell types, the interaction between gfp-lifeact and mrfp-fascin-1s39a was strongly dependent on rho activity ). these fret data confirm that the direct interaction of fascin- <dig> with actin can be imaged using gfp-lifeact as a probe for f-actin, and that the interaction occurs preferentially with non-phosphorylated fascin- <dig> in intact cells. they also reveal that rho acts in intact, ecm-adherent cells to promote the interaction of fascin- <dig> with actin.

rho inhibition does not alter levels of the fascin-1/cpkc complex
to establish whether the mechanism by which rho promotes the fascin-1/actin interaction affects the fascin-1/cpkc complex, which is a known negative regulator of actin-bundling by fascin- <dig>  cell protrusions, and cell migration  <cit> , we carried out fret/flim measurements for the interaction of gfp-fascin- <dig> with cpkc-mrfp in control or inhibitor-treated cells. both c2c <dig> and sw <dig> contain cpkc; pkcα predominates in c2c <dig> cells and pkcγ in sw <dig> cells  <cit> . when activated, both isoforms interact with phospho-fascin- <dig>  <cit> . in both cell types, the fascin-1/cpkc interaction was abolished in bim-treated cells, confirming that this interaction depends on catalytically active cpkc )  <cit> . however, c <dig> treatment did not alter the fret efficiency significantly from that of control cells . strong decreases in gfp fluorescence lifetime, indicative of high fret efficiency, remained detectable at the cell edges and in cell bodies . thus, under native cell conditions, rho activity promotes the fascin-1/actin interaction , but is neutral for the fascin-1/cpkc interaction that is a known antagonist of f-actin bundling by fascin- <dig>  these data suggest that the rho-dependent pathway involves a novel form of regulation of fascin- <dig> 

modulation of the fascin-1/actin interaction by rho depends on rho kinases but not on myosin-based contractility
to identify molecular components downstream of rho in this novel pathway, we tested the effect of inhibiting rho effectors that are known mediators of actin-based cell contractility. c2c <dig> and sw <dig> cells each express both isoforms of rho-associated coiled-coil-forming kinases  . y <dig> treatment, which inhibits rho kinases, strongly inhibited the gfp-lifeact/mrfp-fascin-1s39a interaction in both cell types . the y27632-treated cells resembled c3-treated cells in having irregular morphologies . confocal immunofluorescence microscopy for endogenous fascin- <dig> showed that y27632-treated c2c <dig> cells on fn had more irregular morphologies, with fascin-containing protrusions around the cells , again resembling the morphology of c3-treated c2c <dig> cells . similarly, f-actin organization at cell edges  was altered from protrusive lamellipodial edges and linear filopodia in control cells to flexible filopodia around cell margins after y <dig> treatment . these protrusions were confirmed to be de novo filopodia, not retraction fibers, because they were assembled as new protrusions and stabilized throughout the course of the time-lapse experiments .

the effects of y <dig> treatment were analyzed further by confocal time-lapse imaging of live sw <dig> cells co-expressing gfp-fascin- <dig> and mrfp-lifeact, in order to enable clear visualization of fascin-positive filopodia. in control cells, all filopodia contained both fascin- <dig> and lifeact . individual filopodia initiated, extended, and retracted over  <dig> to  <dig> minutes . line-scan analysis of fluorescence intensities for gfp-fascin- <dig> and mrfp-lifeact along the length of individual filopodia showed a strong fascin- <dig> signal along the entire length of the shaft of each filopodium, and a progressive reduction in the lifeact signal towards the tip . the filopodia of y27632-treated cells were less linear, remained extended over a longer timescale ; see additional file  <dig>  movie 3), and had reduced fascin- <dig> intensity along the length of each filopodium . thus, the y27632-induced bending and altered dynamics of filopodia are probably due to alterations in organization of the core actin bundle of each filopodium and to the expected alteration in cell-body contractility caused by reductions in contractile stress fibers.

another major mediator of cell contraction is myosin light chain kinase,   <cit> . to establish whether either mlck or myosin activity act to inhibit actin bundling by fascin- <dig>  fn-adherent c2c <dig> cells were treated with ml- <dig> as an inhibitor of mlck, or  <dig> -butanedione monoxime  as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of actomyosin, which has also been reported to act as a chemical phosphatase  <cit> . in contrast to the y <dig> treatment, no enhancement of endogenous fascin- <dig> in peripheral bundles was detected, indicating that the inhibitory activity of rho kinases is not mediated by myosin-based contractility . similarly, expression of a dominant-negative truncated caldesmon that blocks stress-fiber assembly  <cit>  did not promote peripheral fascin-1/actin bundles . the possible roles of mlck and myosin atpase were also examined by fret/flim analysis of sw <dig> cells co-expressing gfp-lifeact and mrfp-fascin-1s39a. neither ml- <dig> nor blebbistatin  inhibited the interaction between fascin- <dig> and actin . thus, under native conditions, rho activity promotes the interaction of fascin- <dig> with actin through a rho kinase-dependent, myosin ii-independent mechanism.

fascin-1/actin binding is promoted by interaction of fascin- <dig> with lim kinases
having identified from the above experiments that a rho/rho kinase/fascin- <dig> pathway is active in two distinct cell types, our further experiments focused on sw <dig> cells migrating on ln, for which signaling regulation of fascin- <dig> has been studied extensively  <cit> . because the activity of rho kinases on fascin- <dig> is not mediated by myosin-based contractility, we first investigated if fascin- <dig> might interact with a rho kinase. sw <dig> express rho kinases i and ii . however, using flim analysis, there was no fret seen between mrfp-fascin-1s39a or mrfp-fascin-1s39d with either gfp-rho kinase i or gfp-rho kinase ii. furthermore, neither rho kinase i nor rho kinase ii co-immunoprecipitated with either endogenous or overexpressed fascin- <dig> in sw <dig> cells, or with purified hexahistidine-tagged fascin- <dig>  and fascin- <dig> was not a substrate in rho kinase assays in vitro . we conclude that fascin- <dig> is not a direct binding partner of rho kinase i or ii.

the lim kinases, limk <dig> and limk <dig>  are well-established substrates and effectors of rho kinases. limk1/ <dig> are dual-specificity kinases that function in organization of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, cell-motility processes including cancer metastasis, and cell cycle progression  <cit> . in migrating sw <dig> cells, endogenous limk <dig> and limk <dig> are located in the cytoplasm and at protrusive edges, where gfp-fascin- <dig>  promoter, 'specgfp'; see methods) also concentrates . to test for a possible direct interaction between fascin- <dig> and limk1/ <dig>  a fret/flim assay was set up. in sw <dig> cells, robust fret was detected between mrfp-fascin-1s39a and either gfp-limk <dig> or gfp-limk <dig> . the interactions were also analyzed using gfp-fascin- <dig> as the fret donor and mrfp-limk <dig> as the acceptor . interaction of mrfp-fascin-1s39a with either limk  <dig> or limk <dig> was inhibited in cells treated with either c <dig> or y <dig>  confirming that the interaction depends on active rho small gtpase and rho kinases . rho kinases activate limk by phosphorylation of threonine  <dig>  or threonine  <dig> ; this induces limk dimerization, autophosphorylation, and catalytic activation  <cit> . as expected, the levels of activated pt508/t <dig> limk1/ <dig> were sharply decreased in cells treated with c <dig> or y <dig> .

to confirm the novel fascin-1/limk1/ <dig> interaction by an independent biochemical method, and to investigate whether the s <dig> phosphorylation site of fascin- <dig> has a role in the interaction, hexahistidine -tagged fascin- <dig> , or 6his-fascin- <dig> with point mutations of s <dig> were expressed in escherichia coli, purified with metal-affinity beads, and matched amounts loaded onto fresh metal-affinity beads. equal protein loadings of sw <dig> cell lysate were passed over the beads, and bound candidate proteins were identified by immunoblotting after extensive washing. relative to a control bead matrix, limk <dig> was found to bind to all three forms of fascin- <dig>  indicating that s <dig> phosphorylation of fascin- <dig> does not control this interaction . however, some enrichment of limk <dig> on fascin-1s39a matrix was detected across multiple experiments . active limk1/ <dig> bound to both the wild-type and mutant fascin- <dig> proteins, as detected with an antibody to t508/t505-phosphorylated limk1/ <dig> . very low levels of limk <dig> were detected in sw <dig> cells, and limk <dig> binding to 6his-fascin- <dig> was not detected . the limk <dig> interaction with fascin- <dig> was specific, because binding of rho kinase i or ii was not detected  in agreement with the previous fret analyses of possible rho kinase binding to fascin- <dig>  also in agreement with the fret data, lysates from cells treated with c <dig> exotoxin or y <dig> showed reduced binding of limk <dig> to 6his-fascin- <dig> . this result again indicates the importance of limk <dig> activation for its binding to fascin- <dig>  the combined fret and biochemical data show that rho-dependent regulation of the fascin-1/actin interaction is achieved by activation of limk1/ <dig> and an unsuspected direct interaction of fascin- <dig> with limk1/ <dig> 

the fascin-1/limk1/ <dig> interaction depends on limk1/ <dig> activation and modulates filopodia dynamics
to study the mechanism and functional role of the fascin-1/limk interaction in carcinoma cells, we first measured interactions of non-activatable  or catalytically inactive  forms of gfp-limk <dig> with mrfp-fascin- <dig> by fret/flim in sw <dig> cells migrating on laminin. the catalytic activity of limk <dig> was not required for the interaction. by contrast, limk1t508a showed significantly reduced fret with fascin- <dig>  the phosphomimetic mutant, limk1t508d, had a similar level of fret to that of wild-type limk <dig> . thus, the activating phosphorylation of limk1t <dig> is important for the interaction of limk <dig> with fascin- <dig>  to relate these findings to filopodia assembly, the possible co-localization of wild-type or fascin-binding or non-binding mutant forms of gfp-limk <dig> with mrfp-fascin- <dig> was examined by confocal microscopy. fascin- <dig> was located along the length of each linear filopodium, and limk <dig> was detected at the base of filopodia . similar observations were made with cells co-expressing mrfp-lifeact and gfp-limk <dig> . these observations are in line with other reports on the cellular localization of limk1: typically, limk1/ <dig> are mostly cytosolic, without bulk co-localization with the actin cytoskeleton or substrates such as cofilin  <cit> . cells expressing gfp-limkt508a showed fascin-1/limk co-localization in some areas of protrusions , while cells expressing gfp-limk1d460a had fewer filopodia that contained less fascin- <dig> . as quantified from the static images, cells expressing gfp only, gfp-limk <dig>  or gfp-limk1t508a formed equivalent numbers of filopodia, and in each case the filopodia were around  <dig> μm in length . in cells expressing gfp-limk1d460a, the few filopodia that formed were around  <dig> μm in length .

the requirement for kinase activity of limk1/ <dig> in filopodia formation is in line with the known roles of limk1/ <dig> in stabilization of f-actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . the effects of expression of wild-type or mutant limk <dig> on filopodia dynamics in migratory sw <dig> cells were therefore examined by time-lapse confocal microscopy. kymography was also carried out to visualize physical displacement of individual filopodia over time. compared with cells expressing gfp only, the filopodia of gfp-limk1-expressing cells had a longer life , as measured by reduced displacement of the tips of filopodia over time . by contrast, the filopodia of cells expressing gfp-limk1t508a, which does not interact with fascin- <dig>  had motility equivalent to the filopodia of control cells . cells expressing catalytically inactive gfp-limk1d460a initiated filopodia that collapsed and did not persist, thus leading to fewer and smaller filopodia, in agreement with the static images . the motility and displacement over time of the few filopodia that did form in gfp-limk1d460a-expressing cells were equivalent to the behavior of filopodia of control cells . thus, promotion of the fascin-1/actin interaction stimulates the stability and persistence of filopodia.

discussion
several lines of indirect evidence have linked the formation of fascin-containing cell protrusions with the status of actomyosin contractility or focal adhesions, but the processes involved, in particular the role of rho gtpase, have remained obscure. in this study, we established, with multiple lines of evidence, that rho activity modulates the ability of fascin- <dig> to interact with actin in both normal and carcinoma-derived cells. the discovery of this novel function of rho was advanced by the development of a novel assay to measure the fascin-1/actin interaction by fret/flim microscopy. in this assay, a small, actin-binding peptide, lifeact, was adopted as the fret donor. lifeact binds reversibly to f-actin, and thus fret with fascin- <dig> takes place only when both molecules are in close proximity  and bound to filamentous actin. the specificity of the interaction measured was established by: 1) the lack of fret interaction of lifeact with the non-actin-bundling form of fascin- <dig>  fascin-1s39d; 2) the independence of fascin-1/lifeact fret from pkc kinase activity, and 3) the correspondence of lifeact distribution and fascin-1/lifeact fret with a subset of the f-actin structures to which phalloidin binds.

using the combined approaches of immunofluorescence microscopy, time-lapse imaging of cells expressing gfp-fascin- <dig>  and the novel fret assay, we found that inhibition of either rho or its effectors rho kinase i and ii resulted in inhibition of the fascin-1/lifeact interaction as measured by fret/flim. according to the indirect immunofluorescence of endogenous f-actin or fascin- <dig> and the imaging of live cells expressing gfp-fascin- <dig>  inhibition of either rho or rho kinases also altered cell morphology and led to the formation of more protrusions containing fascin- <dig> at cell edges. when analyzed in detail by confocal time-lapse microscopy, the filopodial activity of y27632-treated cells was seen to occur within regions of increased membrane ruffling. these filopodia had distinct characteristics: gfp-fascin- <dig> was not localized strongly along the filopodial shaft; the filopodia were less straight, probably as a result of loss of actin-bundle rigidity caused by decreased localization of fascin- <dig> towards filopodial tips , and the lifetimes of these filopodia were longer .

the fret assay studies a specific molecular interaction within the overall assembly/disassembly dynamics of protrusions. because rho kinase inhibition of sw <dig> migration on ln is fascin-1-independent  <cit> , it is likely that control of protrusion number has a multifactorial basis, for example, it may be linked to both actomyosin-based cell tension and chemical signaling. inhibition of rho or rho kinases is well known to inhibit stress-fiber microfilament bundles within cell bodies  <cit> ; however, in our experiments, many cells treated with these inhibitors displayed increased association of fascin- <dig> with cell-body microfilament bundles. fascin- <dig> and tropomyosin act as antagonists for actin binding, and previous studies of ecm-adherent cells have indicated preferential association of fascin- <dig> with cell-body microfilament bundles in cells under conditions of reduced focal adhesion assembly and contractility  <cit> . treatments with c <dig> toxin or y <dig> are likely to lead to similar conditions of reduced cell contractility in adherent cells.

by combining the new lifeact fret assay with biochemical analyses of cell extracts, we have identified rho-dependent regulation as a novel signaling process that affects both fascin- <dig> and the fascin-1/actin interaction. importantly, the mechanistic basis for the pathway downstream of rho and rho kinases resides in a previously unidentified process, the interaction of limk1/ <dig> with fascin- <dig>  both of the limk isoforms are expressed in many tissues, although specificity of expression patterns and subcellular localizations has been described  <cit> . in this study, we identified the interaction of fascin- <dig> with active limk1/ <dig> in sw <dig> cells by biochemical pull-down from cell extracts and by fret/flim in intact, migrating cells. as established by the immunoblots, fascin- <dig> pull-down experiments, confocal microscopy, and fret/flim analysis for limk <dig>  the mechanism of the interaction depends on limk <dig> activation by rho kinase phosphorylation, but is independent of the status of s39-phosphorylation of fascin- <dig>  both s39-phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated fascin- <dig> are needed for efficient migration of sw <dig> cells  <cit> , and these new data suggest that the limk1/fascin- <dig> interaction is a possible mechanism to retain s39-phosphorylated fascin- <dig> in proximity to actin structures at cell edges. we found that fascin- <dig> localized in filopodia in cells expressing wild-type or t508a mutant forms of limk1; however, only wild-type limk <dig> was competent to stabilize filopodia. limk1-t508a, which did not interact with fascin- <dig> in the fret assay, did not increase filopodial persistence. thus the limk1/fascin- <dig> interaction contributes to the stability of filopodia. as reported previously  <cit> , expression of kinase-dead limk <dig> reduced in decreased numbers of filopodia, and the remaining filopodia were not stabilized.

overall, these results identify a novel pathway that regulates actin-binding by fascin- <dig>  with functional consequences for filopodial stability . regulation of the fascin-1/actin interaction did not depend on activity of mlck or on myosin atpase activity, and is thus separable from the status of actomyosin contractility.

similar to fascin- <dig>  limk <dig> and limk <dig> contribute functionally to cancer cell invasion and metastasis, and are therefore of interest as therapeutic targets  <cit> . thus, fascin- <dig> and limk1/ <dig> might co-operate to promote protrusions and cell motility if they are co-expressed in tumors. for example, limk1/ <dig> overexpression is well known to increase f-actin, protrusions, and stress fibers in various cells, and correspondingly, limk1/ <dig> knockdown or expression of kinase-dead limk1/ <dig> decreases f-actin stability, filopodia/lamellipodia, and cell migration  <cit> . we propose that the cell protrusion phenotypes observed after limk1/ <dig> inhibition may, in part, be mediated by reduced actin binding and bundling by fascin- <dig>  interestingly, limk1/ <dig> are also downstream effectors of p21-activated kinases , which, as we have previously shown regulate formation of the fascin-1/cpkc complex in colon carcinoma cells, and which also correlate clinically with metastatic progression  <cit> . thus, limk1/ <dig> might represent a nexus between several pathways that regulate the ability of fascin- <dig> to participate in different protein complexes.

a well-characterized substrate of limk1/ <dig> is cofilin, an actin-binding protein that acts to depolymerise f-actin by its actin-severing activity. phosphorylation of cofilin on ser- <dig> by limk1/ <dig> inhibits its severing activity, resulting in the aforementioned stabilization or reorganization of actin structures  <cit> . similar to fascin- <dig>  the cofilin pathway has been linked to breast-cancer metastasis  <cit> . it was recently shown that cofilin associates transiently with retracting filopodia, and that its actin-severing activity is enhanced on actin bundles crosslinked by fascin- <dig>  <cit> . the relationship between the fascin-1/limk1/ <dig> complex and cofilin in the dynamics of filopodia are questions of future interest. it will be important to establish if fascin- <dig> competes with cofilin for limk <dig> kinase availability, thereby modulating actin dynamics directly, or whether limk1/ <dig> act directly or indirectly as a scaffold to maintain fascin- <dig> in proximity to f-actin. alternatively, fascin- <dig> binding might inhibit the kinase activity of limk1/ <dig>  thereby affecting actin dynamics indirectly, as previously shown for nischarin  <cit> . limk <dig> contributes to the transcriptional activity of serum response factor  <cit> , and it will be interesting to determine if this activity is modulated by fascin- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have identified a novel activity of the small gtpase rho in promoting the interaction of fascin- <dig> with actin in ecm-adherent, migratory cells. rho, rho kinases, and limk1/ <dig> were identified as key effectors, and activated limk <dig> or limk <dig> act as novel binding partners of fascin- <dig>  these findings have many implications for our understanding of how fascin- <dig> protein complexes and actin dynamics are coordinated in contractile and protrusive actin-based structures in intact cells, and may be particularly relevant to carcinoma cell migration and metastasis. in the course of the study, we developed a novel method for analysis of the fascin-1/actin interaction by fret/flim. this method has potential general applicability for analyzing the activities of actin-binding proteins in intact cells.
