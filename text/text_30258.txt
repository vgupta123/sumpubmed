BACKGROUND
felid herpesvirus  <dig> , an alphaherpesvirus, causes upper respiratory tract disease in cats that is characterised by pyrexia, severe nasal and ocular discharge, conjunctivitis and oral ulceration. it is a common cause of necrotising upper respiratory tract infections  in cats housed in shelters, with more than 50 % of cats shedding virus only one week after admission  <cit> . the virus typically replicates in epithelial cells of the conjunctiva and the upper respiratory tract and infects local neurons, establishing latency in the trigeminal, pterygopalatine and cranial cervical ganglia  <cit> . although virus replication is generally limited to the upper respiratory tract and conjunctiva, viraemia has been detected during the acute phase of infection  <cit>  and a recent report has described a case of non-suppurative meningoencephalitis in cats, suggesting that fhv- <dig> has potential to cause more invasive disease  <cit> . vaccination has been used to help control disease caused by fhv- <dig> since the mid-1970s. both attenuated and inactivated vaccines are in use currently, and while they can reduce the severity of disease, they do not prevent infection .

early studies demonstrated that isolates of fhv- <dig> were antigenically indistinguishable using conventional serological techniques. additionally, a high level of genomic homogeneity was identified using restriction endonuclease cleavage analyses  <cit> . a subsequent restriction endonuclease cleavage analysis study of  <dig> japanese isolates detected three fhv- <dig> genotypes, although these genotypes still appeared to be very similar  <cit> . since these early studies there has been only limited investigation of the extent of variation between vaccine and wild type strains of fhv- <dig> 

this study aimed to use next generation sequencing to compare the genomes of contemporary australian clinical isolates of fhv- <dig> to those of historical clinical isolates, including isolates that predate the introduction of live attenuated vaccines into australia. analysis of the genome sequences aimed to assess the level of genetic diversity, identify potential genetic markers that could influence the in vivo phenotype of the isolates and examine the sequences for evidence of recombination.

RESULTS
genome sequence analysis of  <dig> fhv- <dig> isolates
the full genome sequences of a panel of  <dig> fhv- <dig> isolates were assembled and analysed. this included  <dig> australian clinical field isolates spanning nearly 40 years, as well as isolates from two currently available vaccines. the genome sequence of the prototype c- <dig> fhv- <dig> strain , a historical isolate from north america, was also included in the analysis  <cit> . the genomes of the feligen vaccine isolate of fhv- <dig> assembled by two different methods  were identical, with the exception of the regions containing short sequence repeats. this provided a high level of confidence in genome assembly by mapping to a reference sequence and this method was used for all other fhv- <dig> isolates in this study. genome sequence data have been deposited into genbank under the accession numbers as listed in table  <dig> . the size of the fhv- <dig> full genomes ranged from  <dig>  kbp  to  <dig>  kbp . genome length variation occurred primarily as a result of differences in the large sequence repeat regions  and in the unique short region as a result of tandem repeat iterations.table  <dig> fhv- <dig> isolates sequenced in this study

despite the long time span over which the isolates were obtained, alignment of the fhv- <dig> genomes  revealed that diversity between them only ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %. while the limited geographical range of many of the australian isolates could have influenced this, three of the genomes analysed in this study were from isolates of north american origin. the most genetically diverse isolates , differed genome-wide by only  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms , while some isolates shared 100 % nucleotide identity . the identical viruses included 356/ <dig> with 571/ <dig>  while the eleven 2004/ <dig> field isolates differed by  <dig> to  <dig> snps, and the three  <dig> isolates differed by  <dig> or  <dig> snps. the two vaccines were identical  and so are both likely to have been derived from the widely used f <dig> strain. the c- <dig> strain, a field strain isolated contemporaneously with the f <dig> vaccine strain from the usa, varied from the f2-derived vaccine strains by only  <dig> snps genome-wide   <cit> . the non-synonymous nucleotide differences , as indicated by predicted amino acid residue differences between isolates, are provided in table  <dig> fig.  <dig> nucleotide sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree of the complete genomes of  <dig> fhv- <dig> isolates, excluding the terminal repeat region. a alignment of the complete genome sequences of fhv- <dig> isolates performed using mafft. the feligen vaccine f <dig> isolate was used as the reference sequence. vertical black lines indicate snps relative to the reference and dashes indicate sequence gaps. b phylogenetic tree generated from the complete genome alignment, using the jukes cantor model and the neighbor-joining method. one thousand bootstrap replicates were used to assess the significance of the tree topology. the bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site. the origin of isolates is indicated to the right of the isolate name

phylogenetic and recombination analyses of fhv- <dig> isolates
phylogenetic analyses revealed that fhv- <dig> isolates fell into two main groups . whilst some isolates with known geographical or temporal associations did cluster together , overall there was no clear relationship between viral genome sequences, the geographical location where the virus was isolated, the year of virus isolation or whether they predated the date of introduction of the attenuated fhv- <dig> vaccine into australia in  <dig>  no clear association was detected between the genome sequence and the presence or nature of disease in the cat from which the virus was isolated.

discussion
the genome sequences of australian isolates that predated the introduction of the fhv- <dig> vaccine into australia  had a high sequence identity with isolates obtained since then, and also with isolates originating from the usa. overall, our data demonstrated that fhv- <dig> genomes are highly conserved, more so than any of the other herpesviruses analysed to date, with a similar study of equine herpesvirus  <dig>  isolates finding variation of between  <dig> and  <dig> snps between ehv- <dig> isolates  <cit> . previous studies have suggested greater differences between fhv- <dig> isolates, including re-arrangements in the ul <dig>  gene  <cit> , restriction endonuclease cleavage site differences in the ul <dig> gene  <cit> , and differences in mlui cleavage patterns across the genome  <cit> . however, all the isolates examined in our study had conserved gene arrangements, with only one snp detected in ul <dig> , and the predicted restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns generated from the sequence data varied mainly as a result of variations in short tandem repeat iterations.

this study included analyses of fourteen fhv- <dig> isolates from cats housed in an animal shelter between  <dig> and  <dig>  the cluster of viruses from this shelter in  <dig> and  <dig> is of particular interest because of the apparent transience of a dominant virus in a shelter environment. the snp profile of the viruses from  <dig> to  <dig> was distinct from those of all the other isolates sequenced, but this pattern was not detected in the  <dig> isolates from the same shelter. the close phylogenetic relationship between the viruses isolated in 2004/ <dig>  and between those collected in  <dig>  suggests endemic circulation in each of these periods, with clear evidence of displacement of the 2004/ <dig> viruses by those detected in  <dig>  this displacement may have occurred as a result of increased transmissibility of the newer viruses, or management changes, such as seasonal crowding  <cit> , depopulation and repopulation of the shelter, or sampling bias .

in vitro studies have reported a high rate of recombination in fhv- <dig>  <cit> . however, no evidence of recombination was detected between the  <dig> fhv- <dig> isolates, irrespective of genomic region analysed or the program used . it is possible that recombination events may not have been detected because of the low levels of diversity among the viruses in our study. it is also possible that previous in vitro studies may have overestimated the likelihood of fhv- <dig> recombination because of the use of high multiplicities of infection and simultaneous infection, as both these factors have been shown in previous studies to increase the rate of recombination in vitro in other herpesviruses  <cit> . recombination would be predicted in circumstances where the opportunity for co-infection is high and where the recombinant progeny have a survival advantage over the parent viruses and dominant field strains. while infective pressure in a shelter environment would be expected to allow concurrent infections with different fhv- <dig> isolates, there may be insufficient selective pressure on recombinants for them to emerge and persist in vivo in a natural  environment, particularly as the low levels of diversity among fhv- <dig> viruses may result in insufficient selective distinction for specific viruses to emerge in a population.

CONCLUSIONS
attenuated herpesvirus vaccines are used not only against fhv- <dig> in cats, but also against marek’s disease virus and infectious laryngotracheitis virus  in poultry, bovine herpesvirus  <dig> in cattle, pseudorabies virus in swine, and ehv- <dig> and equine herpes virus  <dig>  in horses. previous studies of iltv in poultry have demonstrated that attenuated vaccine strains can participate in natural recombination events that lead to the generation of more virulent progeny  <cit> . the risk of recombination involving other attenuated veterinary herpesvirus vaccines has not been evaluated comprehensively, but the risk appears to higher in some viruses  and lower in others   <cit> . the results from this study suggest that the risk for fhv- <dig> vaccine recombination may also be low. although the fhv- <dig> genome sequencing data from this study confirms the findings of earlier studies that fhv-1 s are relatively homogeneous  <cit>  this study did detect snps unique to f2-derived vaccine strains, in genes ul <dig> and ul <dig>  a search of all fhv- <dig> sequences available on genbank identified only nine sequences covering these regions of the fhv- <dig> genomes, all relating to the ul <dig> gene. none of the sequences contained the vaccine-specific snp, however the sequences were mostly of unknown origin apart from two; a bac of the c- <dig> strain  and strain c <dig> . there is the potential to use the f2-derived vaccine unique snps to differentiate vaccine fhv- <dig> isolates from other circulating fhv-1 s, and thus facilitate future epidemiological studies in fhv- <dig>  especially to investigate the epidemiology of attenuated fhv- <dig> vaccines. sequencing of more geographically diverse isolates will help confirm whether these snps are suitable markers for such studies.
