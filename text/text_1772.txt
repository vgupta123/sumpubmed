BACKGROUND
plants are vulnerable to various biotic and abiotic stresses but have evolved to equip with sophisticated signaling networks to precisely regulate defense response to unfavorable stresses. upon perception of environmental stress, a set of early signaling events including changes in the cytosolic free calcium  concentration signatures  is often activated and integrated into different signaling pathways, which ultimately initiate transcriptional reprogramming leading to expression of a large set of stress-responsive genes  <cit> . extensive biochemical and genetic studies have demonstrated that cellular ca2+ as a universal second messenger plays critical roles in regulating defense responses to diverse biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> .

cellular ca2+ changes can be sensed and interpreted by calcium-binding proteins  including calmodulin , calcineurin b-like proteins and calcium-dependent protein kinases  <cit> . these cabps regulate cellular responses through two distinct pathways upon sensing different biotic and abiotic signals  <cit> . firstly, cabps trigger rapid responses by direct binding to cytosolic target proteins and modulating their activity. alternatively, cabps modulate indirect and relatively slow cellular responses by interacting with transcription factors to regulate gene expression. recently, a class of cam-binding transcription factors  has been identified in plants  <cit> . the camta proteins, also called signal-responsive  proteins, are present in all plant and animal species examined to date and are highly conserved in their protein structures. typically, the sr/camta proteins contain a cg- <dig> dna-binding domain  at the n-terminus, a tig domain , three ankyrin repeats  and five putative cam-binding motifs called as iq motif  <cit> . biochemical studies with the arabidopsis atsr <dig> and rice oscbt proteins have identified the primary target of dna cis-element for sr/camta proteins as cgcg and cgtg motifs in promoter regions of the target genes  <cit> .

the sr/camta proteins represent a small family of transcription activators in plants. for instance, six genes encoding for sr/camta proteins were identified in arabidopsis  <cit> . the sr/camta genes were shown to be responsive to multiple abiotic and biotic stresses including cold, wounding, drought and pathogen attack, as well as to stress-related hormones like ethylene, auxin, methyl jasmonate  and salicylic acid   <cit> . recent genetic studies with loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants have shown that members of the sr/camta family play important roles in plant response to abiotic and biotic stresses. the arabidopsis atsr <dig> knockout mutant showed enhanced disease resistance against multiple pathogens with different infection styles including pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato , botrytis cinerea and golovinomyces cichoracearum  <cit>  but decreased resistance against insect herbivores  <cit> . by contrast, overexpression of atsr <dig> conferred an increased susceptibility to pst dc <dig>  b. cinerea and g. cichoracearum  <cit> . similarly, the rice oscbt mutant exhibited significant resistance to blast fungal pathogen magnaporthe grisea and leaf blight bacterial pathogen xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae  <cit> . on the other hand, it was recently shown that the arabidopsis atsr <dig> and atsr <dig> also play important roles in regulating tolerance to low temperature  <cit>  and drought stress  <cit> . the function of sr/camta proteins in plant biotic and abiotic stress response is achieved mainly through regulating expression of genes whose promoter regions contain the cgcg boxes  <cit> .

seven slsrs/camtas  genes were identified in tomato and were shown to be developmentally regulated during fruit development and ripening and induced by ethylene  <cit> . further detailed analysis revealed that the slsr genes showed differential expression patterns in tomato fruit in response to low temperature, mechanical injury, infection of the necrotrophic fungal pathogen b. cinerea, and treatments with the signaling molecules sa and meja  <cit> . however, direct genetic evidence supporting the involvement of the tomato slsrs in biotic and abiotic stress responses is still lacking. in the present study, we investigated the possible functions of slsrs in disease resistance and drought stress tolerance using virus-induced gene silencing  approach. our vigs-based functional analyses demonstrate that both slsr <dig> and slsr3l are negative regulators of defense response against b. cinerea and pst dc <dig> while slsr1l is a positive regulator of drought stress response.

RESULTS
expression patterns of slsrs in response to pathogen infection
to explore the possible functions of slsrs in defense response against pathogen infection, we analyzed the expression patterns of slsr genes in tomato plants after infection with different pathogens, b. cinerea, a necrotrophic fungal pathogen causing grey mold disease, and pst dc <dig>  a  biotrophic bacterial pathogen causing bacterial leaf spot disease. in analysis of expression patterns of slsrs in response to infection of b. cinerea, leaf samples collected from the whole plant inoculation assays were used and the expression pattern of sllapa, a defense gene regulated by the ja/et-mediated signaling pathway  <cit> , was monitored to confirm the efficiency of the inoculation procedure. as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression level of sllapa in b. cinerea-inoculated plants increased significantly, leading to  <dig> folds of increase at  <dig> hr post inoculation  and > <dig> folds of increase at  <dig> hpi relative to those in the mock-inoculated plants, suggesting that our inoculation assays were appropriate for further analysis of the expression patterns of slsrs in response to b. cinerea. data from repeated qrt-pcr analyses revealed that the expression of almost all slsrs was induced by infection of b. cinerea and the induced expression of slsrs was evident after  <dig> hpi and showed distinct patterns . the expression levels of slsr <dig>  slsr1l, slsr2l and slsr3l were induced significantly by b. cinerea, leading to increases of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> folds at  <dig> hpi and of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> folds at  <dig> hpi, respectively, over those in the mock-inoculated plants . the expression level of slsr <dig> in the b. cinerea-inoculated plants showed 3-fold increase at  <dig> hpi, peaked with 7-fold of increase at  <dig> hpi and then declined to the level in the mock-inoculated plants . by contrast, the expression levels of slsr <dig> and slsr <dig> in the b. cinerea-inoculated plants exhibited slight increases with less than  <dig> folds as compared with those in the mock-inoculated plants . these results indicate that the expression of slsrs could be induced with distinct patterns by b. cinerea and that the expression of most slsr genes except for slsr <dig> and slsr <dig> was highly responsive to infection of b. cinerea.figure  <dig>

we next analyzed the expression patterns of slsrs in response to a virulent strain of pst dc <dig>  in these experiments, the expression pattern of slpr-p <dig>  a defense gene regulated by the sa-mediated signaling pathway  <cit> , was examined to confirm the efficiency of the inoculation procedure. as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression level of slpr-p <dig> in the pst dc3000-inoculated plants increased at  <dig> hpi and showed  <dig> and > <dig> folds of increase at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, over those in the mock-inoculated plants, confirming that the effectiveness of the inoculation procedure was satisfied for further analysis of the expression patterns of slsrs in response to pst dc <dig>  the expression levels of slsr1l, slsr <dig>  slsr2l and slsr <dig> in the pst dc3000-inoculated plants were similar to those in the mock-inoculated plants, indicating that their expression was not responsive to infection of pst dc <dig> . however, the expression levels of slsr <dig> and slsr3l were significantly induced by pst dc <dig> . a 3-fold increase of the expression of slsr <dig> in the pst dc3000-inoculated plants was observed at  <dig> hpi but no significant increase in the expression level of slsr <dig> in the pst dc3000-inoculated plants was observed within the first  <dig> hpi, as compared with those in the mock-inoculated plants . the expression level of slsr3l in the pst dc3000-inoculated plants exhibited 2-fold and 4-fold increases at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi, respectively, relative to those in the mock-inoculated plants . interestingly, the expression of slsr <dig> in the pst dc3000-inoculated plants was suppressed by pst dc <dig> during the first  <dig> hpi and this suppression of slsr <dig> expression was very quick as the expression level of slsr <dig> in the pst dc3000-inoculated plants decreased by approximately  <dig> folds relative to that in the mock-inoculated plants . the expression level of slsr <dig> in the pst dc3000-inoculated plants restored to the level in the mock-inoculated plants . these results indicate that the expression of slsrs could be induced with distinct patterns by pst dc <dig> and that the expression of slsr <dig> and slsr3l was induced but the expression of slsr <dig> was suppressed by pst dc <dig> figure  <dig>

silencing of slsr <dig> and slsr3l conferred an increased resistance to b. cinerea and pst dc3000
to explore the possible functions of slsrs in plant defense response, we used the trv-based vigs system  <cit>  to knockdown the expression levels of slsr genes in tomato plants and compared the phenotypes and severity of diseases caused by b. cinerea and pst dc <dig>  respectively. in our vigs study, we chose sequences that encode for the highly diverged regions in the slsr proteins to avoid interference with expression of other non-target slsr genes when one target slsr gene was attempted to be silenced . silencing efficiency and specificity were assessed by qrt-pcr analyzing the transcript abundance of the target slsr gene in the silenced and non-silenced ptrv2-gus-infiltrated control plants. as shown in figure  <dig>  the transcript levels of each slsr gene in the corresponding silenced plants were significantly reduced, leading to the silencing efficiency of 70–75% in standard vigs experiments, as compared with those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants. by contrast, the transcript levels of each slsr gene in those plants that were silenced for one of the other six slsr genes were comparable to the level in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated control plants , indicating that silencing only occurred for the targeted gene but not for the other non-targeted sisr genes. thus, the silencing efficiency and specificity under our experiment conditions were satisfied for further study and all the subsequent experiments were performed only on those ptrv2-slsr-infiltrated plants with high levels of silencing efficiency .figure  <dig> 
silencing efficiency and specificity for target genes in silenced plants. two-week-old tomato seedlings were infiltrated with agrobacteria carrying ptrv2-slsrs or ptrv2-gus constructs and leaf samples were collected from ptrv2-slsrs- and ptrv2-gus-infitlrated plants at  <dig> weeks after agroinfiltration. expression levels of each slsr genes in targeted and nontargeted slsr genes-silenced and non-silenced plants were analyzed by qrt-pcr and data obtained were normalized with actin transcript values. data presented are the means ± sd from three independent experiments.



we first examined the possible roles of slsrs in resistance against b. cinerea by challenging the ptrv2-slsrs-infiltrated plants with spore suspension of b. cinerea and comparing the disease severity and in planta fungal growth with those in ptrv-gus-infiltrated non-silenced plants. in our detached leaf assays, b. cinerea-caused lesions on detached leaves from the ptrv2-slsr1l-, ptrv2-slsr2-, ptrv2-slsr2l-, ptrv2-slsr3- and ptrv2-slsr4-infiltrated plants were similar to the lesions on the detached leaves from ptrv2-gus-infilrtratd plants , suggesting that slsr1l, slsr <dig>  slsr2l, slsr <dig> and slsr <dig> may not be involved in disease resistance against b. cinerea. however, b. cinerea-caused lesions on detached leaves from the ptrv2-slsr1- and ptrv2-slsr3l-infiltrated plans developed slowly and were still separated, as compared with the large merged lesions on leaves from the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants, at  <dig> days after inoculation  . at  <dig> dpi, the lesion sizes on detached leaves from the ptrv2-slsr1- and ptrv2-slsr3l-infiltrated plants were significantly reduced, leading to a reduction of approximately 35%, as compared with that of the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . we further analyzed and compared the in planta fungal growth in the ptrv2-slsr1-, ptrv2-slsr3l- and ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants after inoculation by foliar spraying with spore suspension of b. cinerea in whole plant inoculation experiments. qrt-pcr analysis of the transcript levels of the b. cinerea actin gene bcactin, which was used as an indicative of the rate of fungal growth in planta, showed that the fungal growth in the ptrv2-slsr1- and ptrv2-slsr3l-infilrated plants were significantly suppressed, resulting in reductions of 35–51% at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, as compared with those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . these results indicate that the slsr1- and slsr3l-silenced plants were more resistant to b. cinerea infection than the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants. taken together, these data demonstrate that silencing of slsr <dig> or slsr3l resulted in increased resistance against b. cinerea and thus both slsr <dig> and slsr3l may act as negative regulators of disease resistance against b. cinerea.figure  <dig>

we next explored whether slsrs have functions in resistance against pst dc <dig>  disease phenotypes and bacterial growth in planta were compared between the ptrv2-slsrs- and ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants after inoculation with a virulent strain of pst dc <dig>  at  <dig> dpi, the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants showed typical bacterial speck disease symptoms, including necrotic lesions surrounded by chlorosis . the disease severity and bacterial growth in planta in inoculated ptrv2-slsr1l-, ptrv2-slsr2-, ptrv2-slsr2l-, ptrv2-slsr3- and ptrv2-slsr4-infiltrated plants were comparable to those in the ptrv2-gus-inflitrated plants , suggesting that slsr1l, slsr <dig>  slsr2l, slsr <dig> and slsr <dig> are not involved in disease resistance to pst dc <dig>  by contrast, the ptrv2-slsr1- and ptrv2-slsr3l-infiltrated plants showed very weak visible symptoms of disease caused by pst dc <dig>  as compared with that in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . this reduced disease symptoms on leaves of the ptrv2-slsr1- and ptrv2-slsr3l-infiltrated plants were coincided with relatively low levels of bacterial growth in planta after inoculation with pst dc <dig>  at  <dig> dpi, the bacterial populations in leaves of the ptrv2-slsr1- and ptrv2-slsr3l-infiltrated plants were  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/cm <dig>  leading to a reduction of 10-fold, as compared to that in leaves of the ptrv-gus-infiltrated plants  . these results demonstrate that silencing of either slsr <dig> or slsr3l led to increased resistance against pst dc <dig> and thus both of slsr <dig> and slsr3l are also negative regulators of disease resistance to pst dc <dig> figure  <dig>

silencing of slsr <dig> and slsr3l resulted in constitutive defense response
the arabidopsis sr <dig> mutant plants were previously found to display chlorosis and constitutive expression of defense genes under lower temperature, indicating that loss of sr <dig> function in arabidopsis led to constitutive defense response  <cit> . to examine whether silencing of slsr <dig> or slsr3l could also confer constitutive defense responses, we analyzed and compared the accumulation of h2o <dig> and expression of genes involved in different signaling pathways and defense response between the ptrv2-slsr1- and ptrv2-slsr3l-infiltrated plants and the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants. results from  <dig> -diaminobenzidine  staining of in situ h2o <dig> accumulation showed that significant brown precipitates, representing the accumulation of h2o <dig>  were easily and clearly observed in leaves of the ptrv2-slsr1- and ptrv2-slsr3l-infiltrated plants without infection of pathogen, while no significant brown precipitate was seen in leaves of the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . these results indicate that silencing of either slsr <dig> or slsr3l resulted in constitutive accumulation of h2o <dig> in tomato plants. to explore the possible mechanism for the constitutive accumulation of h2o <dig> in the slsr1- and slsr3l-silencedd plants, we analyzed and compared the expression of genes encoding for nadph oxidases, which are plasma membrane-localized ros generating enzymes  <cit> , and for catalases , superoxide dismutases  and ascorbate peroxidases , which are involved in scavenging of ros, in the ptrv2-slsr1- and ptrv2-slsr3l-infiltrated plants. as shown in figure 6b, the expression levels of rboh <dig> and wfi <dig>  two genes for nadph oxidases, in the ptrv2-slsr1- and ptrv2-slsr3l-infiltrated plants were significantly elevated, giving increases of 5 ~ 7-fold for rboh <dig> and 4 ~ 5-fold for wfi <dig>  as compared with those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants. similarly, the expression levels of cat and apx in the ptrv2-slsr1- and ptrv2-slsr3l-infiltrated plants were also increased as compared with those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . by contrast, no significant difference was observed in the expression level of sod between the ptrv2-slsr1- and ptrv2-slsr3l-infiltrated plants and the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . these results indicate that the constitutive accumulation of h2o <dig> in the slsr1- and slsr3l-silenced plants might be attributed to the increased ros generating ability resulted from the high level of expression of the nadph oxidases.figure  <dig>

we next examined whether silencing of slsr <dig> or slsr3l led to constitutive expression of defense genes. the expression levels of five representative defense genes that are regulated through different defense signaling pathways and three marker genes for pathogen-associated molecular patterns-triggered immunity  were analyzed and compared between the ptrv2-slsr1- and ptrv2-slsr3l-infiltrated plants and the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants. as shown in figure 6b, the expression levels of pr1a, pr1b and pr-p <dig>  which are thought to be regulated by the sa-mediated signaling pathway  <cit> , and of pin <dig> and lapa, which are considered to be regulated by the ja/et signaling pathway  <cit> , were increased significantly in the ptrv2-slsr1- and ptrv2-slsr3l-infiltrated plants, leading to 8 ~  <dig> folds of increases for the pr1a, pr1b and pr-p <dig> genes and 1 ~  <dig> folds of increases for the pin <dig> and lapa genes, as compared with those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants. similarly, the expression levels of pti <dig>  lrr <dig> and wrky <dig>  three pti marker genes in tomato  <cit> , in the ptrv2-slsr1- and ptrv2-slsr3l-infiltrated plants were significantly higher than those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants, resulting in increases of  <dig>  ~  <dig>  folds in the expression levels . these data demonstrate that silencing of either slsr <dig> or slsr3l activates constitutively the expression of the defense and pti genes, leading to constitutive defense response in the slsr1- and slsr3l-silenced plants.

to determine whether silencing of slsr <dig> and slsr3l activates defense signaling pathways, we further analyzed and compared the expression levels of the key genes encoding important components involved in the sa- and ja/et-mediated signaling pathways between the ptrv2-slsr1- and ptrv2-slsr3l-infiltrated plants and the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants. the expression levels of npr <dig>  eds <dig> and tga <dig>  known to be critical components in the sa-mediated signaling pathway  <cit> , in the ptrv2-slsr1- and ptrv2-slsr3l-infiltrated plants were significantly increased, especially for the expression levels of the eds <dig> and tga <dig> genes, showing 1-fold increase relative to those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . similarly, the expression levels of etr <dig> and erf <dig>  known to be associated with et signaling pathway  <cit> , in the ptrv2-slsr1- and ptrv2-slsr3l-infiltrated plants showed 1 ~ 2-fold increase over those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . by contrast, the expression level of jaz <dig>  known to be associated with ja signaling pathway  <cit> , in the ptrv2-slsr1- and ptrv-slsr3l-infiltrated plants was reduced as compared with those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . these results suggest that silencing of either slsr <dig> or slsr3l can activate both the sa- and et-mediated signaling pathways but suppress the ja-mediated signaling pathway in the slsr1- and slsr3l-silenced plants.

expression patterns of slsrs in response to drought stress and aba
to explore the possible involvement of slsrs in drought stress response, we first examined whether the expression of slsrs could be induced by drought stress and abscisci acid  treatment. two different methods, the detached leaf and the whole plant assays, were adapted to analyze the expression of slsrs in response to drought stress. in these experiments, a previously reported drought stress-responsive gene, sgn- <dig>  <cit> , was included to confirm the efficiency of the drought stress treatment. the expression level of sgn- <dig> was markedly increased after drought stress treatment, leading to increases of >100-fold at  <dig> hr after treatment in the detached leaf assays  and at  <dig> days after treatment in the whole plant assays , indicating that the experiments for drought stress assays were satisfied for further analyzing the expression of the slsr genes. in the detached leaf assays, as compared with the expression levels of the corresponding genes in the water-saturated detached leaves, no significant change in the expression levels of slsr <dig>  slsr <dig>  slsr <dig> and slsr <dig> was observed over a period of  <dig> hr after detachment , whereas a maximal increase of 4 ~ 8-fold in the expression levels of slsr2l and slsr3l was observed during 3– <dig> hr after treatment . by contrast, the expression kinetic of slsr1l under drought stress condition was similar to that of the sgn- <dig> gene . the expression level of slsr1l in the drought stress treated leaves started to increase at  <dig> hr after detachment and exhibited approximately an increase of 50 ~  <dig> folds as compared with that in the water-saturated leaves . in the whole plant assays, the drought stressed plants exhibited clear wilting symptom at  <dig> days after withholding water whereas the normally watered plants did not show any wilting symptom . qrt-pcr analyses revealed that the expression of slsrs except slsr <dig> was induced by drought stress. the expression levels of slsr <dig>  slsr <dig>  slsr <dig> and slsr3l in the drought stressed plants showed a slight increase, leading to an increase of approximately  <dig> fold or less over those in the normally watered plants . however, the expression levels of slsr1l and slsr2l in the drought stressed plants increased significantly as compared with those in the normally watered plants, resulting in increases of  <dig> folds and  <dig> folds, respectively . taken together, these results suggest that some slsrs especially slsr1l are responsive to drought stress. we also analyzed whether the expression of slsrs could be induced by exogenous application of aba, a well-known hormone involved in drought stress response  <cit> . in these experiments, the expression level of the drought stress-responsive gene sgn- <dig> in the aba-treated plants was markedly increased, leading to increases of 5 ~ 34-fold over those in the control plants ; however, the expression levels of slsrs in the aba-treated plants showed changes with less  <dig> folds as compared with those in the control plants , indicating that exogenous aba did not affect the expression of slsrs.figure  <dig>

vigs assays were performed to explore the involvement of individual slsrs in drought stress response. for this purpose, we stopped watering for 7– <dig> days to compare the phenotype between the ptrv2-slsrs- and ptrv2-gus-inflitrated plants. in repeated experiments, silencing of slsr <dig>  slsr <dig>  slsr2l, slsr <dig>  slsr3l or slsr <dig> did not affect drought stress response over an experimental period of  <dig> days , indicating that these slsr genes may not be involved in drought stress response. however, the ptrv-slsr1l-infiltrated plants showed significant wilting symptom at  <dig> days after drought stress treatment as compared with that of the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants , implying a role for slsr1l in drought stress tolerance. the ptrv2-slsr1l-infiltrated plants grew well as the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants before withholding water, but they were easier to appear wilting symptom after stopping watering and their leaves became curly and the plants wilted at  <dig> days after withholding water . this result indicates that silencing of slsr1l attenuated the drought stress tolerance in tomato. to explore the possible mechanism for the reduced drought stress tolerance in the slsr1l-silenced plants, we first analyzed and compared the physiological and morphological changes between the ptrv2-slsr1l- and ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants before and after drought stress treatment. the rate of water loss in leaves from the ptrv2-slsr1l-infiltrated plants was higher than those in leaves from the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants during the first  <dig> hr after detachment , indicating that silencing of slsr1l accelerated water loss in leaves. the ptrv2-slsr1l-infiltrated plants had smaller root system as compared to the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . similarly, dry weights of the roots from the ptrv2-slsr1l-infiltrated plants were significantly lower than that of the roots from the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants, resulting in a reduction of approximately 40% . furthermore, we also analyzed and compared the expression of some previously reported drought stress-responsive genes slareb <dig>  <cit> , slareb <dig>  <cit> , sldreb  <cit> , slspusp  <cit> , slgrx <dig>  <cit> , sgn- <dig>  <cit>  and sgn- <dig>  <cit>  in the ptrv2-slsr1l- and ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants before and after drought stress treatment. before drought stress treatment, the expression levels of slareb <dig>  slareb <dig>  sldreb, slspusp and sgn- <dig> in the ptrv2-slsr1l-infiltrated plants were comparable to those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants, whereas the expression levels of slgrx <dig> and sgn- <dig> the ptrv2-slsr1l-infiltrated plants showed a slight increase as compared with those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . at  <dig> days after drought stress treatment, the expression levels of slareb <dig>  sldreb, slspusp, slareb <dig> and sgn- <dig> in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants increased significantly as compared with those in the normally watered control plants . after drought stress treatment, however, the expression levels of slareb <dig>  sldreb, slspusp, slareb <dig> and sgn- <dig> in the ptrv2-slsr1l-infiltrated plants decreased markedly as compared with those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . the expression level of sgn- <dig> decreased in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants as compared with that in the normally watered plants but increased significantly in the ptrv2-slsr1l-infiltrated plants as compared with that in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants after drought stress treatment .figure  <dig>

slsr <dig> and slsr3l are localized in nucleus and have transactivation activity
because of the importance of slsr <dig> and slsr3l in defense response against b. cinerea and pst dc <dig>  we investigated the biochemical characteristics of these two slsr proteins. firstly, we examined the subcellular localization of slsr <dig> and slsr3l using a transient expression approach. we transiently expressed slsr <dig> and slsr3l in leaves of 4-week-old n. benthamiana plants by infiltration with agrobacteria carrying pfgc-egfp-slsr <dig>  pfgc-egfp-slsr3l or pfgc-egfp constructs and gfp was observed at  <dig> days after agroinfiltration. as shown in figure 9a, the slsr1-gfp and slsr3l-gfp fusions accumulated exclusively in the nucleus of n. benthamiana cells, whereas the gfp protein alone accumulated in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, demonstrating that both slsr <dig> and slsr3l proteins are localized in the nucleus of cells. furthermore, we also examined whether the slsr <dig> and slsr3l proteins had transactivation activity using a yeast assay system. as shown in figure 9b, all yeast transformants grew well on sd/–trp medium. however, only yeast transformants containing pbd-slsr <dig> or pbd-slsr3l were able to grow on the sd/–trp/–his medium and produced a blue pigment after the addition of x-α-gal, showing a β-galactosidase activity, whereas transformants containing the pbd empty vector did not. these results indicate that both slsr <dig> and slsr3l have transactivation activity in yeasts. taken together, our experimental data demonstrate that both slsr <dig> and slsr3l are nucleus-localized transcriptional activators.figure  <dig>

discussion
previous studies have identified a total of seven slsrs genes in tomato and found that expression of slsrs was regulated in tomato fruit by developmental cues and by biotic and abiotic environmental stress signals  <cit> ; however, the biological functions of slsrs in tomato response to biotic and abiotic stress remain unclear. in the present study, data from our vigs-based functional analyses demonstrate that both slsr <dig> and slsr3l act as negative regulators of defense response against b. cinerea and pst dc <dig> while slsr1l functions as a positive regulator of drought stress tolerance in tomato. these findings not only demonstrate that members of the small slsr family play important roles in regulation of defense responses to biotic and abiotic stresses but also extend our understanding on the biological function of slsrs in regulating stress response.

in plants, members of the sr family have been shown to be induced by infections from different pathogens. for example, the expression of atsr <dig> in arabidopsis was induced by pst dc <dig> and g. cichoracearum  <cit> . in this study, we observed that the expression of slsrs could be induced with different patterns by pst dc <dig> and b. cinerea . in response to infection of b. cinerea, all the slsrs showed upregulated expression patterns in leaf tissues, especially for slsr <dig>  slsr1l, slsr3l and slsr <dig>  whose expression levels were significantly upregulated . the b. cinerea-induced expression patterns of slsrs in leaf tissues are somewhat different from the previous observation that the expressions of slsr <dig>  slsr1l, slsr2l and slsr <dig> in wounded tomato fruit were suppressed by b. cinerea  <cit> , probably due to the tissue-specific expression feature of the slsrs  <cit> . in contrast to the b. cinerea-induced expression patterns of slsrs, expression of slsr <dig>  slsr1l, slsr <dig> and slsr3l in leaf tissues was upregulated in response to infection of pst dc <dig> . the pst dc3000-induced expression of slsr <dig> is similar to that of the arabidopsis atsr <dig>  closely related to slsr <dig>  <cit> , whose expression was induced by pst dc <dig>  <cit> . however, infection of pst dc <dig> did not affect the expression of slsr <dig> and slsr <dig> but suppressed the expression of slsr <dig> in leaf tissues , which is contrast to the observation that the expression of slsr <dig> in fruit tissues was induced by b. cinerea  <cit> . therefore, it seems reasonable that the expression of slsrs is precisely controlled by complex mechanisms in response to infection from different pathogens. on the other hand, the b. cinerea- and pst dc3000-induced expressions of slsrs, especially for slsr <dig> and slsr3l, were much evident after  <dig> hr of inoculation , which is similar to the observation that the expression of atsr <dig> in arabidopsis leaves was only significantly induced by pst dc <dig> after  <dig> hr of inoculation  <cit> . it was also found that the expression of most slsrs in tomato fruits was markedly induced by exogenous sa and meja only after  <dig> hr of treatment  <cit> . these observations suggest that most of the slsrs should belong to late pathogen-responsive genes  <cit> . the b. cinerea- and pst dc3000-induced expression of slsr <dig> and slsr3l in leaves , along with their sa- and meja-induced expression patterns in fruits  <cit> , suggest that slsr <dig> and slsr3l may play important roles in defense response to infection of b. cinerea and pst dc <dig> 

in our vigs-based functional analyses of slsrs in defense response against different pathogens, we found that silencing of either slsr <dig> or slsr3l resulted in increased disease resistance against b. cinerea and pst dc <dig>  as the slsr1- and slsr3l-silenced plants exhibited less severity of the diseases and supported less in planta growth of the pathogens than the non-silenced plants , indicating that loss-of-function of either slsr <dig> or slsr3l confers a broad-spectrum disease resistance against different pathogens with distinct infection styles. slsr <dig> is phylogenetically closely related to the arabidopsis atsr <dig>  <cit> , whose loss-of-function mutant plants showed increased disease resistance against three different pathogens including pst dc <dig>  b. cinerea and g. cichoracearum  <cit>  and gain-of-function mutant plants exhibited compromised systemic acquired resistance and basal immunity  <cit> . similar results were also observed in the mutant plants of the oscbt gene, a rice sr family member closely related to atsr <dig> and slsr <dig>  which exhibited significant enhanced resistance to blast fungal pathogen m. grisea and leaf blight bacterial pathogen x. oryzae pv. oryzae  <cit> . thus, it is likely that loss-of-function of some of the sr family members can confer broad-spectrum disease resistance in plants. this may have extensive significance that members of the sr family can be used for generating transgenic varieties with broad-spectrum resistance in economically important crops through rna interference-mediated suppression of expression of target sr genes. notably, in addition to sr <dig>  the function of other sr family members in disease resistance has not been elucidated so far. in this study, we demonstrated that slsr3l, like slsr <dig> in tomato  and atsr <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> , acts as a negative regulator of disease resistance against different pathogens in tomato. this finding characterized one member with important function in disease resistance from the relatively small sr family. it will be interesting to examine whether the arabidopsis homologs of slsr3l, atsr <dig> and atsr <dig>  <cit> , play roles in regulating disease resistance. although expression of slsr1l, slsr <dig>  slsr2l and slsr <dig> was induced by b. cinerea and/or pst dc <dig> , silencing of each of these slsr genes had no effect on disease resistance against these two pathogens . the expression of slsr <dig> was induced by b. cinerea but suppressed by pst dc <dig> ; however, silencing of slsr <dig> did not lead to any alteration in disease resistance to b. cinerea and pst dc <dig> . these results indicate that the slsr genes are highly responsive to pathogen infection but the responsiveness of these slsr genes may be a side effect caused by pathogen infection but not a true reflection for their function in disease resistance.

the observed increased disease resistance against b. cinerea and pst dc <dig> in the slsr1- and slsr3l-silenced plants may be attributed to an improved basic immunity resulted from loss-of-function of slsr <dig> and slsr3l. this hypothesis is supported by several lines of evidence obtained from some biochemical and molecular analyses toward the slsr1- and slsr3l-silenced plants under pathogen-free conditions. firstly, the slsr1- and slsr3l-silenced plants constitutively accumulated high level of h2o <dig> in leaves, as revealed by in situ dab staining . similar phenomenon was also observed in the arabidopsis sr <dig> mutant plants that accumulated high level of h2o <dig> in leaves without pathogen infection  <cit> . it was previously found that suppression of slwfi <dig> expression resulted in significant decrease of h2o <dig> accumulation in antisense tomato plants  <cit> . the expression of slwfi <dig> and slrboh <dig>  encoding plasma membrane-localized nadph oxidases that are involved in generating ros  <cit> , was significantly upregulated in the slsr1- and slsr3l-silenced plants , indicating an accelerated generation of ros in these plants. by contrast, the ros scavenging capacity in the slsr1- and slsr3l-silenced plants might not be affected significantly as the expression of the sod gene was not changed . the upregulated expression of the cat and apx genes in the slsr1- and slsr3l-silenced plants might be a response to the high level of h2o <dig> accumulated in these plants as h2o <dig> was found to be capable of mediating the expression of cat genes under stress conditions  <cit> . an accelerated generation with an unchanged scavenging capacity in the slsr1- and slsr3l-silenced plants broke the ros generating and scavenging balance and favored to accumulate high level of h2o <dig>  which in turn acts as signaling molecules to activate defense response against pathogens. secondly, the slsr1- and slsr3l-silenced plants constitutively expressed defense genes and pti marker genes. similar to the observations that the arabidopsis sr <dig> and rice oscbt mutant plants constitutively expressed a diverse set of defense genes  <cit> , constitutive high levels of expression of defense genes including slpr1a, slpr1b, slpr-p <dig>  slpin <dig> and sllapa, which are regulated by different signaling pathways, were observed in the slsr1- and slsr3l-silenced plants . in addition, the expression of the pti marker genes including pti <dig>  lrr <dig> and wrky <dig>  <cit>  was also significantly upregulated in the slsr1- and slsr3l-silenced plants . these data indicate that both slsr <dig> and slsr3l negatively regulate pti response. in this regarding, silencing of either slsr <dig> or slsr3l would relieve their suppression on pti response and thus lead to increased resistance against multiple pathogens including b. cinerea and pst dc <dig> . this is supported by general knowledge that pti but not effector-triggered immunity  plays important roles in regulating immunity against necrotrophic fungal pathogens like b. cinerea  <cit>  while both the pti and eti are require for immunity to biotrphic/hemibiotrophic pathogens such as pst dc <dig>  <cit> . thirdly, the slsr1- and slsr3l-silenced plants constitutively activated the sa- and et-mediated defense signaling pathways. it was previously found that the arabidopsis sr <dig> mutant plants contained high level of sa and had upregulated expression of defense and signaling genes  <cit>  and that atsr <dig> can bind to the cgcg box in the promoters of eds <dig>  ndr <dig> and ein <dig>  <cit> , indicating the involvements of atsr <dig> in the sa- and et-mediated signaling pathways. our qrt-pcr analyses of expression of some defense signaling pathway-associated genes also demonstrated that both slsr <dig> and slsr3l have functions that negatively regulate the sa- and et-mediated signaling pathways in tomato, as revealed by the upregulated expression of the slnpr <dig>  sleds <dig>  sltga <dig>  sletr <dig> and slerf <dig> genes in the slsr1- and slsr3l-silenced plants . this is partially supported by the facts that the expression of slsr <dig> and slsr3l in tomato fruits was induced rapidly by exogenously applied sa and et  <cit> . in particular, it was shown that the arabidopsis atsr <dig> could bind to the cgcg box, a characteristic cis-elements for the sr proteins  <cit> , in the promoter region of eds <dig> and suppressed the expression of eds <dig>  <cit> , which is critical to biosynthesis of sa. bioinformatics analysis also identified a cgcg box within  <dig>  kb from the starting codon in the promoter of tomato sleds <dig> gene  <cit> . it is thus possible that slsr <dig> and perhaps slsr3ll regulate negatively the expression of sleds <dig> through binding to the cgcg box as the expression level of sleds <dig> was upregulated when either slsr <dig> or slsr3l was silenced . furthermore, the expression of sljaz <dig>  known to be associated with the ja-mediated signaling pathway  <cit> , was downregulated in the slsr1- and slsr3l-silenced plants , suggesting a negative impact of slsr <dig> and slsr3l on the ja-mediated signaling pathway. this is in agreement with the observations that the arabidopsis atsr <dig> is a negative regulator for ja biosynthesis and herbivory tolerance  <cit> . another possibility that the constitutively activated sa-mediated signaling pathway in the slsr1- and slsr3l-silenced plants antagonistically suppressed the ja-mediated signaling pathway cannot be ruled out because the antagonistic cross-talk between these two signaling pathways is a common phenomenon occurred in regulating defense response against infection by different pathogens  <cit> . taken together, these data suggest that both slsr <dig> and slsr3l negatively regulate basic immunity in tomato through modulating the sa- and et-mediated signaling pathways.

the involvement of the sr family members in abiotic stress was recently investigated using arabidopsis knockout mutant lines  <cit> . our vigs-based functional analyses discovered that silencing of slsr1l resulted in decreased drought stress tolerance . slsr1l is phylogenetically related to the arabidopsis atsr <dig>  <cit> , which was shown to regulate drought stress responses  <cit> . thus, it is likely that slsr1l plays an important role in regulation of drought stress tolerance in tomato. the expression of slsr1l was induced significantly by drought stress in detached leaves and in whole plants . the decreased drought tolerance in the slsr1l-silenced plants might be caused by multiple factors including morphological, physiological and molecular changes, which are affected by loss-of-function of slsr1l. like the stunted primary root in the arabidopsis sr <dig> mutant plants  <cit> , the slsr1l-silenced plants had limited root system and biomass under normal growth condition . although the exact function of slsr1l in development of the root system in tomato needs to be further investigated, the limited root system in the slsr1l-silenced plants may result in reduced capacity of water uptake. another fact that affected the water status in the slsr1l-silenced plants was the accelerated rate of water loss, as revealed in the detached leaves . furthermore, the expression of slareb <dig>  <cit> , sldreb  <cit> , slspusp  <cit> , slareb <dig>  <cit>  and sgn- <dig>  <cit>  was suppressed in the slsr1l-silenced plants , indicating that slsr1l may regulate the expression of a large set of drought stress-responsive genes. recent microarray-based analyses of gene expression profiling between the arabidopsis sr <dig> and wild type plants revealed that hormone-mediated signaling such as aba-mediated signaling plays important roles in atsr1-regulated abiotic stress response  <cit> . however, exogenous aba did not induce the expression of slsr1l in tomato  and atsr <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> . thus, it is likely that, as a transcription factor, slsr1l acts in a yet-unknown signaling pathway, in which some hormones such as aba are involved, to regulate drought stress response in tomato.

our data presented in this study clearly demonstrate that slsr1/slsr3l and slsr1l play important roles in biotic and abiotic stress responses, respectively. however, several questions regarding the mechanism of action of slsr1/slsr3l and slsr1l in biotic and abiotic stress response need to be addressed. further identification of downstream target genes regulated by slsr1/slsr3l and slsr1l will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and the signaling pathways involved in the slsr1/slsr3l-regulated defense response against pathogens and the slsr1l-regulated drought stress response. of particular, the slsr3l will be a priority for further study because the function of its orthologs in other plants such as the arabidopsis atsr <dig> and atsr <dig>  <cit>  has not been defined yet. on the other hand, biochemical studies have shown that the arabidopsis atsr2/camta <dig>  <cit> , rice oscbt  <cit>  and tomato slsr <dig> and slsr3l  are functionally transcriptional activators in yeast. however, the arabidopsis atsr <dig> was shown to bind to the cgcg box in the promoters of the eds <dig>  ndr <dig> and ein <dig> genes and repress their expression  <cit> . thus, the biochemical mechanism regarding how the sr proteins as transcriptional activators repress the expression of the target genes after binding to the cgcg box in the promoters of these genes needs to be further investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
tomato genome encodes seven slsr genes and expression of slsr <dig> and slsr3l was significantly induced by b. cinerea and pst dc <dig>  silencing of either slsr <dig> or slsr3l resulted in enhanced resistance to b. cinerea and pst dc <dig> and led to constitutive accumulation of h2o <dig>  elevated expression of defense genes, pti marker genes and regulatory genes involved in the sa- and et-mediated signaling pathways. meanwhile, expression of slsr1l was significantly induced by drought stress and silencing of slsr1l led to decreased drought stress tolerance. these results demonstrate that both slsr <dig> and slsr3l in the tomato slsr/camta family are negative regulators of defense response against b. cinerea and pst dc <dig> while slsr1l is a positive regulator of drought stress tolerance in tomato.
