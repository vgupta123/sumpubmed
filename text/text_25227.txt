BACKGROUND
endogenous small rnas  in plants, such as micrornas  and short-interfering rnas , were first reported in  <dig>  <cit> . since then, our knowledge about these regulatory molecules has been vastly improved  <cit> . plant mirnas are a class of short  srnas produced from non-coding, imperfectly complementary  rna precursors  <cit> , which can be transcribed by rna polymerase ii  <cit> . the majority of currently known plant mirnas was identified via size-selected cloning and sequencing  <cit> . recently developed high-throughput sequencing strategies have greatly expanded the depth of mirna cloning coverage  <cit> . in addition to model species, more srnas have been identified from crop plants such as rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , and wheat  <cit> . studies of plant mirnas have indicated that this group of regulatory molecules plays crucial roles in numerous biological processes, e.g., general plant development  <cit>  and responses to environmental signals  <cit> . moreover, plant mirnas and their roles in plant development have been extensively reviewed  <cit> .

seed production is a unique transitional process during the life cycle of higher plants, providing a physical link between parental and progeny sporophytic generations  <cit> . it is likely that the roles of mirnas in gene regulation are as critical in maturing seeds as they are in other tissues  <cit> . the millions of short sequence reads that have resulted from next-generation sequencing technologies make that technique explicitly suitable for the profiling of mirnas. because of high-throughput sequencing, researchers have been able to identify conserved and novel mirnas in the seeds of rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , barley  <cit> , and brassica napus <cit> . their presence in those species suggests that mirna-mediated negative regulation has a crucial role during seed development.

hexaploid wheat is one of the most valuable cereal crops, occupying 17% of all cultivated land and providing approximately 55% of the carbohydrates consumed by humans worldwide  <cit> . in addition to being a food source, these grains are used as livestock feed and industrial raw materials, which mainly exploits the endosperm reserves of starch and proteins that account for approximately 80% of a mature seed  <cit> . hence, the process by which wheat grains develop directly determines yields and quality of the end product. to improve those traits, researchers must have a keen molecular understanding of the mechanisms that modulate those steps in plant growth. because little is known about mirna-mediated regulation in developing wheat grains, our study employed high-throughput sequencing to characterize the mirnas that potentially participate.

RESULTS
dry matter accumulation and appearance of maturing grain
to evaluate the developmental process for wheat grains, we monitored the pattern by which dry matter was accumulated in those tissues. here, seed weights increased sharply between  <dig> and 18 days after pollination  and continued to rise until  <dig> dap . based on the pattern we observed, we continued our focus mainly on activities between  <dig> and  <dig> dap, the key period for grain-filling, as well as on grains sampled at both  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap so that we could compare the expression profiles of mirnas near the beginning and end of that stage of formation. the size and appearance of developing caryopses at those time points are shown in figure 1b.

deep-sequencing of srnas in developing grains
to investigate the enrichment of mirnas, we generated four libraries from developing wheat grains sampled on four dates. after sequencing via the illumina genome analyzer, we removed low-quality reads and corrupted adapter sequences . in all, we obtained  <dig> , <dig> reads  representing  <dig> dap,  <dig> , <dig> reads  for  <dig> dap,  <dig> , <dig> reads  for  <dig> dap, and  <dig> , <dig> reads  for  <dig> dap. our assessment of the size distributions demonstrated that approximately 98% of the detected srnas were  <dig> to  <dig> nt long, and that 24-nt srnas were prevailing in all stages whereas those that were  <dig> nt long were less abundant . further analysis revealed that the distribution of redundant srnas in various size classes was quite similar among the libraries from  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dap grains. we found it interesting that the abundance of 24-nt redundant srnas was significantly decreased in  <dig> dap grains while the proportion of those that were  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt were obviously increased . the distribution patterns for unique srnas were similar among all four libraries . the patterns of distribution between redundant and unique srnas indicated that the abundance of srnas fluctuated during the period of seed development. therefore, we evaluated their relative abundance from  <dig> to  <dig> nt based on the ratio of redundant/unique and found that expression was generally altered over time . transcript levels for most srna sizes were obviously decreased in the  <dig> dap samples. this was especially true for 24-nt srnas, which were gradually repressed. the canonical heterochromatic sirnas are  <dig> nt long and these results suggested that sirna-mediated gene regulation might be involved in the control of grain formation.

for annotation, we used the srna datasets to query the non-coding rnas deposited in the ncbi genbank , rfam database  <cit> , and mirbase . they were then classified into seven categories: mirna, rrna, sirna, snrna, snorna, trna, and those detected but without annotation . the number of unique mirnas increased gradually as the process of grain-filling continued , implying that mirna-mediated gene silencing is involved in developmental regulation. moreover, the total read of mirnas was relatively lower at  <dig> dap , leading to a lower ratio  of mirnas at that time point . small rnas were more abundant in the  <dig> dap library than in any other , suggesting that mirna expression was generally down-regulated at that later stage of maturation.

conserved mirnas differentially expressed in developing grains
to identify the conserved mirnas in developing grains, we aligned the srna sequences with known mature mirnas from plants in the mirbase. in all,  <dig> mirnas representing  <dig> families were identified . in general, we found that  <dig> conserved mirnas  were differentially expressed  over time . their scatter plots illustrated the similarities during the stages of grain formation, as well as the broad relationships among mirna expression profiles from  <dig> dap through  <dig> dap . however, some differences in profiles were apparent from this examination. when compared with values at  <dig> dap,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mirnas were significantly up- or down-regulated  at  <dig> dap,  <dig> dap, and  <dig> dap, respectively. it is likely that the number of up-regulated mirnas was gradually increased  over time, demonstrating that mechanisms for mirna-mediated repression are involved in this developmental regulation.

conserved mirnas associated with grain-filling
among those  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas, expression was lower for  <dig> mirnas, i.e., those with fewer than  <dig> tpms . for our investigation, we selected  <dig> mirnas  highly expressed  in developing grains . to find common expression patterns, we performed hierarchical clustering based on fold-changes in expression from a base line of  <dig> dap. in all,  <dig> mirnas could be sorted into eight clusters  that we considered to be potentially involved in the regulation of grain-filling.

the first four clusters  of conserved mirnas generally included those that were up-regulated in the process of grain-filling. clusters i and ii comprised  <dig> mirnas with expression that was very low at  <dig> dap, but which greatly increased at  <dig> dap, and remained high for most mirnas through  <dig> dap. considering that  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap are crucial stages during which a complex gene regulatory network is involved in endosperm development, we concluded that those significantly induced mirna candidates in clusters i and ii might have important regulatory roles. expression of the mirnas in cluster iii was gradually increased over time. for example, mir167a, mir156a, and mir156c, were quite abundant, with expression levels at  <dig> dap of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  tpm, respectively . although they were up-regulated by only a few fold at  <dig> dap, they could have a greater regulatory effect because of their more abundant basis. cluster iv had  <dig> mirnas that were only slightly up-regulated. of these, eight were more highly expressed, with tpm values of > <dig> at  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap. for example, the tpms for mir168a were  <dig>  at  <dig> dap and  <dig>  at  <dig> dap.

four clusters of mirnas showed repression, including six members that were rapidly down-regulated in cluster v. for example, although mir <dig> was highly expressed at  <dig> dap , its level decreased to  <dig>  tpm at  <dig> dap and was undetectable in  <dig> dap grains . clusters vi and vii contained  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas, respectively, all of which were significantly repressed at  <dig> dap and/or  <dig> dap. finally, cluster viii had  <dig> members, including mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were gradually repressed over time.

novel mirnas identified in wheat grains
novel mirnas were predicted according to the characteristic hairpin structures of their precursors, which distinguishes them from other endogenous srnas  <cit> . a total of  <dig> putative novel mirnas  were identified . among them,  <dig> showed at least a relatively higher expression  in developing grains . we were interested to learn that ta-mir034-3p and ta-mir034-5p are homologous to complementary sequences in the same stem-loop . moreover, ta-mir007-5p and ta-mir007-3p were also located in the same stem-loop generated from a wheat est .

further analysis revealed that these  <dig> highly expressed novel mirnas could be sorted into clusters i through vi . cluster i contained four mirnas for which expression rose sharply at  <dig> dap and was maintained at a high level throughout the process of grain-filling. for example, ta-mir021-1-5p was strongly up-regulated over time, peaking at  <dig> dap . expression of the five mirnas within cluster ii was obviously increased at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dap when compared with levels detected at  <dig> dap.

in cluster iii, ta-mir042-3p, ta-mir107-2-3p, and ta-mir106-5p were highly expressed at  <dig> dap, but not at any other developmental stages. by contrast, ta-mir051-3p and especially ta-mir154-5p, both in cluster iv, were significantly up-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dap. in cluster v, four novel mirnas were down-regulated over time. ta-mir068-5p and ta-mir057-1-3p were gradually repressed in developing grains whereas ta-mir007-5p and ta-mir007-3p were highly expressed at  <dig> and  <dig> dap, but undetectable at  <dig> and  <dig> dap. this contrast in up- and down-regulation among these  <dig> novel mirnas from clusters i through v demonstrated their important regulatory roles.

finally, the novel mirnas included in cluster vi were either expressed only at  <dig> dap  or else their transcript abundance fluctuated over time. therefore, their activity did not seem to be associated with this type of developmental regulation. the exception to this was ta-mir034-5p, also in cluster vi, which showed strong expression at all sampled time points.

validation of mirnas in developing grains
we conducted quantitative real time pcr  to validate the expression patterns of mirnas identified via high-throughput sequencing. based on their patterns of development-regulated expression, as determined by deep-sequencing, we selected eight mirnas for examination. seven of them -- mir167a, mir <dig>  mir156a, ta-mir021-1-5p, ta-mir004-1-5p, ta-mir044-1-3p, and mir827a -- were predicted to be induced while mir <dig> was expected to be repressed. in fact, mir167a, mir <dig>  mir156a, ta-mir004-1-5p, ta-mir044-1-3p,and mir827a were significantly up-regulated by  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap, with expression then peaking at  <dig> dap . their expression profiles were quite similar to those determined by high-throughput sequencing . although ta-mir021-1-5p was up- regulated over time while mir <dig> was down-regulated, the degree to which their expression was altered was not as dramatic as had been demonstrated with high-throughput sequencing . those responses may have been affected by the relative abundance of the other srnas. nevertheless, our qrt-pcr results were generally consistent with the data obtained from our high-throughput sequencing, thereby indicating that it is possible to create a set of grain filling-associated mirnas through deep-sequencing of wheat.

targets of grain filling-associated mirnas
the potential targets of  <dig> grain filling-associated conserved mirnas , as well as  <dig> highly expressed novel mirnas , were computationally predicted using the triticum aestivum  unigene library, dfci gene index , and the psrnatarget program   <cit> . all of the targets predicted for those conserved and novel mirnas are shown in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  functional annotations of those target genes were performed by blast analysis with ncbi and it is found that these grain filling-associated mirnas potentially target to multiple wheat genes, which including transcription factors, proteins involved in the membrane transporting, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, carbohydrate metabolism, responding to stress, signal transduction and phytohormone signaling.

to validate the expression patterns of potential targets for grain filling-associated mirnas, we selected six target genes  of candidate mirnas, which were significantly up-regulated with the development of grains, and gene specific qrt-pcr was performed. the expression analysis demonstrated that all detected target genes were strongly down-regulated during grain-filling , which were negatively correlated to the expression profiles of their corresponding mirnas . these results suggested that mirnas play a crucial regulatory role during the developmental processes of grain-filling in wheat.

discussion
for most eukaryotic cells, mirnas are a class of regulatory srnas involved in gene regulation. in plants, some mirnas play crucial roles in various developmental processes, such as the control of root and shoot architecture, transitions from the vegetative to reproductive phase, and leaf and flower morphogenesis  <cit> . in wheat,  <dig> mirnas have been detected in pooled tissue samples  as well as stressed leaves  <cit> . here, we identified  <dig> conserved mirna families and  <dig> novel mirna families, with many being differentially expressed during grain-filling in wheat. despite the growing knowledge about mirna functions in plants, only those of highly conserved mirnas, such as mir <dig> and mir <dig>  have been investigated in crop species. for example, mir <dig> in rice regulates spl , which promotes panicle branching and higher grain productivity  <cit> . likewise, mir <dig> regulates ap2-like genes that are involved in controlling floral organ identity in rice, maize, and barley  <cit> . both of these mirnas were significantly up-regulated and expressed at high levels in our wheat grains during the filling process. we also predicted several new potential targets for mir <dig> and mir <dig>  such as myb-related protein  and the starch negative regulator rsr <dig> .

the processes by which cereal grains mature strongly influence their yield and flour quality. formation of the starchy endosperm, which is the greatest contributor to human nutrition, occurs in several stages  <cit> . in wheat, a major transition point occurs at about  <dig> d after pollination, essentially marking the end of endosperm cell division and the start of grain-filling  in those cells  <cit> . after approximately  <dig> d, that deposition of storage reserves decreases and the grains begin to desiccate. to investigate the regulatory mechanisms mediated by mirnas in wheat, especially those involved in grain-filling, we used high-throughout sequencing for profiling at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dap, and identified a number of grain filling-associated mirnas , which were significantly up- or down- regulated during grain formation. several grain filling –associated mirnas identified in this study have also been previously detected in other cereal seeds. for example, mir156a, mir167d, mir168a, and mir172a are significantly up-regulated in barley grains  <cit> . additionally, these mirnas  were also highly expressed in developing seeds of maize  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . therefore, all of these data suggest that mirnas play crucial regulatory roles during grain development in cereal crops.

target prediction indicated that grain filling-associated mirnas identified in this study potentially target to a set of wheat genes, which are involved in various biological processes including carbohydrate metabolism, protein metabolism, developmental processes, transcription, transport, cell organization and biogenesis, response to stress, signal transduction and phytohormone signaling . of those predicted targets, some may be involved in regulating starch accumulation or grain formation. for example, the triose phosphate translocator , a potential target of mir <dig>  is an integral membrane protein found in the inner membrane of arabidopsis chloroplasts  <cit> . there, it is responsible for exporting all of the carbohydrates produced during photosynthesis. repression of the tpt leads to an increase in starch synthesis in that species. furthermore, phosphoglycerate kinase  might participate in regulating carbon-partitioning between starch and sucrose through a series of reactions  <cit> . in addition, mir <dig> potentially targets ap <dig> domain transcription factors ca <dig> and ca <dig>  with the former being a negative regulator of starch production, which is repressed during the middle stages of grain-filling  <cit> . the expansin gene tc <dig>  a potential target of mir <dig>  was highly abundant during early grain expansion but later repressed, implying that levels of expansin are a possible factor in determining grain size  <cit> . notably, mir <dig> potentially targets a plac <dig> family protein , which functions in regulating cell numbers and affects organ size in maize  <cit> . snf1-related protein kinase regulatory subunit beta- <dig> , a potential target of mir <dig>  has vital roles in a signal transduction cascade that controls gene expression and carbohydrate metabolism in higher plants  <cit> . its counterpart in barley is thought to modulate the accumulation of storage products during grain-filling  <cit> . drg <dig> , a potential target of ta-mir128-5p, may be crucial to the regulation of either vesicle transport or the activity of enzymes for processing storage proteins  <cit> . finally, ta-mir004-1-5p potentially represses sucrose-phosphate synthase, which is negatively correlated with the accumulation of starch  <cit> . overall, our results demonstrate that mirna-mediated mechanisms operate in the regulation of wheat grain development.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> mirnas  associated with grain-filling from wheat and their potential targets are involved in various biological processes, e.g., carbohydrate and protein metabolism, general plant development, transcription, cellular transport, cell organization and biogenesis, stress responses, signal transduction, and phytohormone signaling. these mirna-mediated networks play crucial roles during the maturation of wheat grains, and our mirna data are a valuable resource for future molecular studies that focus on the control of grain development in cereal crops.
