BACKGROUND
group a streptococcus  causes a broad spectrum of illness in humans, ranging from pharyngitis to severe systemic diseases. a resurgence in serious gas infections, such as rheumatic fever, and invasive diseases, such as bacteraemia, necrotising fasciitis, septic arthritis, sepsis, pneumonia and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, has been observed since the mid 1980s. indeed, these have become an important cause of morbidity and mortality all over the world  <cit> .

penicillin is the first choice treatment. macrolides and tetracyclines are the most common alternative antibiotics used with penicillin-allergic patients or when first line therapy fails. increases in macrolide resistance have been reported from many countries, being in europe, very common in the mediterranean countries  <cit> .

streptococci have two main mechanisms of macrolide resistance: target site modification and macrolide efflux systems. the first is achieved through a family of enzymes  that methylate an adenine residue  of the 23s rrna v domain. this leads to a conformational change that reduces the binding of macrolides, lincosamide and streptogramin b to ribosomes, conferring co-resistance to these antibiotics . the mlsb phenotype may be expressed constitutively  or inducibly . these methylases are encoded by erm  genes, with the erm and erm the most common  <cit> . in the second mechanism , transport proteins pump c <dig> and c <dig> macrolides out of the cell . the m phenotype is associated with the presence of the mef and msr genes, which code for the transmembrane and atp-binding domains of this pump respectively  <cit> .

less information is available on the characteristics of tetracycline resistance mechanisms. in streptococci, resistance to tetracycline is conferred by ribosome protection genes such as tet and tet and by efflux pumps encoded by the tet or tet genes, although these last genes are relatively rare  <cit> .

the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance is due to several circulating clones associated with certain emm types. the aim of the present study was to identify antimicrobial resistance in spanish group a streptococcus  isolates and to determine the molecular epidemiology  and resistance mechanisms of those resistant to erythromycin and tetracycline. this study is focused on spanish gas population collected from a wide spectrum of clinical backgrounds and not only from carriers as occurs for other studies. the long term studied period  and the different geographical origin may allow us to obtain an approach more real to susceptibility, phenotypes, genotypes, emm-types and pfge profiles distribution in spain.

RESULTS
overall gas susceptibility rates
all  <dig> spanish gas isolates showed susceptibility to penicillin and vancomycin. in addition, a  <dig> %  rate of resistance to erythromycin was seen, along with  <dig> %  resistance to clindamycin,  <dig> %  resistance to tetracycline, and  <dig> %  resistance to rifampin.

macrolide resistance phenotypes and genotypes
two hundred ninety five  erythromycin resistant isolates were detected among the  <dig> gas isolates gathered over the 13-year collection period. the m phenotype was clearly predominant , followed by the cmlsb  and imlsb phenotypes  . the isolates with the cmlsb phenotype showed high-level resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin , whereas those with the imlsb and m phenotypes showed lower erythromycin resistance values and susceptibility to clindamycin . to highlight, the cmlsb phenotype was more predominant among invasive that in non-invasive,  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively.

in the present work, the mef  and msr  genes were the most prevalent macrolide resistance determinants. erm and erm were observed in just  <dig> % and  <dig> % of isolates respectively . fourteen macrolide resistance genotypes were identified among the  <dig> erythromycin-resistant isolates , with msr/mef  and msr/mef/erm the two most common combination. both genotypes were associated with the m phenotype.

ano. of gas isolates. ball isolates were also resistant to tetracycline, showing co-resistance to both erythromycin and tetracycline. cone isolate showed co-resistance to both erythromycin and tetracycline.

tetracycline resistance phenotypes and genotypes
tetracycline-resistant phenotype was observed in  <dig> isolates , showed mics ranging from  <dig> to 64 mg/l  with a genotype distribution of tet/tet , tet  and tet .

erythromycin and tetracycline co-resistance
co-resistance was detected in  <dig> isolates . the erythromycin mic was >256 mg/l for  <dig> isolates and just 32 mg/l for one isolate. the clindamycin mics were also high at >256 mg/l for  <dig> of the  <dig> isolates. all isolates except one  had the cmlsb macrolide resistance phenotype. the resistance genes detected were erm , erm , mef , msr , tet  and tet , with tet the only tetracycline resistance determinant in  <dig> isolates, while in  <dig> it was simultaneously detected with tet .

t- serotypes and emm types  distribution
twenty one emm/t types were observed in the erythromycin-resistant population  , the  <dig> most common being emm4t <dig> , emm75t <dig> , emm28t <dig> , emm6t <dig> , emm12t <dig>  and emm11t <dig>  which represented  <dig> % of the erythromycin-resistant isolates. high macrolide resistance rates were associated with the above emm/t types: emm75t <dig> , emm4t <dig> , emm11t <dig> , emm28t <dig> , emm6t <dig>  and emm12t <dig> .

in the present tetracycline-resistant population ,  <dig> different emm/t types were identified . emm77t <dig>  was the main emm/t type associated with tetracycline resistance; all emm77t <dig> isolates detected over the 13 years of the study were resistant to this antibiotic.

in the erythromycin- and tetracycline-resistant population population ,  <dig> emm/t types were observed, the majority being emm11t <dig>  ; indeed,  <dig> % of all emm11t <dig> recovered from the initial gas population  were co-resistant.

the correlation between the different emm/t types and macrolide resistance genotypes is shown in table  <dig>  the mef/msr gene complex was the most common in almost all emm/t types, either alone or in combination with other genes. the mef/msr genotype was the most common in the emm1t <dig> , emm4t <dig> , emm6t <dig>  and emm12t <dig>  types. the msr/mef/erm was the most common genotype among the emm4t <dig>  and emm75t <dig>  types.

pfge typing
in the erythromycin-resistant population ,  <dig>  smai-restricted and  <dig>  smai-non-restricted isolates were identified. smai-restricted isolates generated  <dig> pulsotypes with a similarity range of  <dig> % to  <dig> % . their distribution by phenotype was: m , cmlsb  and imlsb .

the  <dig> smai-non-restricted isolates  were typed with sfii, generating  <dig> pulsotypes with a similarity range of  <dig> % to  <dig> % . the m phenotype  predominated over the cmlsb  and imlsb  phenotypes. in addition,  <dig> different emm/t types were detected  among  <dig> smai-non-restricted isolates, the most common being emm4t <dig> and emm75t <dig>  all emm4t <dig> and all emm75t <dig> erythromycin-resistant isolates but one were smai non-restricted and had the m phenotype; together these accounted for  <dig> % of the macrolide-resistant isolates in our study.

in the case of tetracycline-resistant isolates, all were smai-restricted, generating  <dig> pulsotypes with a similarity range of  <dig>  to  <dig> % . the sma10a emm77t <dig> and sma <dig> emm11t <dig> pulsotypes may be associated with tetracycline resistance since 100% of these isolates were resistant to this antibiotic. all co-resistant  isolates were smai-restricted.

discussion
several reports show that gas resistance to macrolides and tetracyclines are high some countries such spain and continue to increase; indeed, they have become clinically problematic.

in europe, the most northerly countries  have reported low levels of resistance   <cit>  while strong resistance has been reported from mediterranean countries such as italy , france , greece , spain  and portugal   <cit> . this values contrast with those of israel  and iran   <cit> .

in our study,  <dig> % of isolates showed resistance to macrolides. efflux pumps  are one of the major mechanisms conferring resistance to macrolide antibiotics, and streptococci making use of this system have been commonly reported from european countries, argentina, the usa and canada  <cit> . the m phenotype has been identified as predominant in several spanish studies, reaching a rate of  <dig> % in a multicentre study undertaken in  <dig> or  <dig> % in an extensive national multicenter surveillance study in 2006– <dig>  <cit> . in the present population, the efflux system was also the main macrolide resistance mechanism seen, being manifested by  <dig> % of isolates.

cmlsb phenotype, another common phenotype reported in europe  <cit> , was displaced by the m phenotype in several european countries from  <dig>  <cit> . in our study, cmlsb phenotype was the second most commonly encountered  like sauce project carried out in 2006– <dig>  <cit> . in this last report, flutuations in the rates of resistance to macrolides are observed  meanwhile there is an increasing trend in the prevalence of mlsb phenotype from 14% in 2001– <dig> to  <dig> % in 2006– <dig>  <cit> .

among spanish isolates of this work, imlsb phenotype was minority  in contrast to norway   or bulgaria   where it was reported the most prevalent phenotype  <cit> .

a gene-phenotype correlation previously described was also noticed  <cit> . mef and erm were predominant in isolates with the m and cmlsb phenotype respectively, whereas all isolates with the imlsb phenotype harboured the erm gene.

the mef gene responsible for the m phenotype was detected in all but three of the present spanish isolates with that phenotype. one of these three isolates showed none of the genes studied. in the remaining two, msr was observed alone or in combination with erm. in these last two cases, the msr gene might be only one of the determinants responsible for the m phenotype. msr and mef have been placed in the same genetic element  <cit> , suggesting that the proteins they encode may act as a dual efflux system. however, it has also been suggested that the msr-encoded pump can function independently of the mef-encoded protein  <cit> .

the erm gene responsible for the cmlsb phenotype was identified in all but three of the present isolates with this phenotype. none of genes tested could be amplified in two isolates, indicating that other resistance genes must be involved. the remaining isolate harboured erm and mef. in this case, erm may be responsible for the cmlsb phenotype since alterations in the regulatory region of the gene have been identified that induce constitutive expression  <cit> .

an ample macrolide resistance genes combination was identified, specifically fourteen genotypes. interestingly, single genotypes could show one or several phenotypes, a phenomenon reported by other authors  <cit> . one of these, erm/msr/mef genotype showed m and mlsb phenotypes in  <dig> and  <dig> isolates respectively, while the erm/erm/msr/mef genotype showed all three macrolide resistance phenotypes. nowadays, this correlation between genotype and phenotype is not well understood.

in our erythromycin-resistant population , the  <dig> most common emm/types: emm4t <dig> , emm75t <dig> , emm28t <dig> , emm6t <dig> , emm12t <dig>  and emm11t <dig>  have been previously associated with macrolide resistance in numerous reports  <cit> . emm <dig> and emm <dig> have been reported the most common in europe   <cit> , and to be responsible for an increase in erythromycin resistance among gas in spain, finland and quebec  <cit> . emm <dig> is the main resistant emm type in germany, greece, italy, portugal, israel  <cit>  and the second one in the united states, being surpassed only by emm <dig>  <cit> .

most of erythromycin-resistant isolates were sma-non-restricted  due to the presence prophage-like elements that confer the m phenotype and harbour the mef and msr genes. these genetic elements encode a dna-modifying methyltransferase that acts on the smai recognition sequence and renders dna refractory to cleavage by smai  <cit> . all but four of the present smai non-restricted isolates were susceptible to tetracycline and had an m phenotype. this suggests that these isolates carry mef and msr contained within a tn <dig>  transposon inserted into a larger genetic element such as the tn <dig>  or  <dig>  kb chimeric element, flanked by the comec gene from the tn <dig> /Φ <dig>  family  <cit> . in our study, all emm4t <dig> and all emm75t <dig> erythromycin-resistant isolates but one were smai non-restricted and had the m phenotype; together these accounted for  <dig> % of the spanish macrolide-resistant isolates. several resistant clones previously described in spain were identified  <cit> . the emm4t <dig> sfi <dig>  clone resembles to clone b described in  <dig>  <cit> . it was the most common in the present study, indicating it to still be circulating in spain. this clone has a wide distribution, and it has recently been identified in finland, greece, italy, england and sweden  <cit> . clone c, previously identified in spain, the united kingdom and the united states  <cit>  was not detected among the present isolates, although it might be related to the present clones emm4t <dig> sfi <dig> and emm4t <dig> sfi <dig> 

the major macrolide-resistant clone emm75t <dig> sfi <dig> was similar  to clone d described by perez-trallero et al.  <cit> . the emm6t <dig> sfi <dig> and emm84t <dig> sfi <dig> clones might be associated with resistance since they were only observed in isolates resistant to erythromycin.

regarding tetracycline resistance, we detected values of  <dig> % between  <dig> and  <dig>  indicating there to be no trend towards increased tetracycline in spain. however, higher rates have been found in other countries such as israel , denmark , portugal  or iran   <cit> .

in this study, a predominance of genotype with both genes tet and tet  was observed. but no spanish reports citing the predominance of both genes appears to exist, tet alone is usually the most common resistance determinant followed by tet  <cit> .

in the present tetracycline-population, emm77t <dig> was the main emm/t type. emm <dig> has been previously associated with resistance to tetracycline in israel and europe  <cit> . in italy and norway, an emm <dig> clone has been reported that is characterised by its carrying tet linked to ermand being associated with the imlsb phenotype  <cit> . in the present study, the two co-resistant emm77t <dig> isolates showed genotypes different to those described by palmieri et al.  <cit> .

with regard to co-resistance, we found that all isolates  except one had the cmlsb macrolide resistance phenotype such as greece  and norway  <cit> . in contrast, in finland, imlsb isolates showing co-resistance have reached rates of 93%  <cit> . a correlation between the m phenotype and co-resistance has been also reported  <cit> , but this was not detected in the present study.

of the  <dig> co-resistant isolates, five carried tet/erm as their only resistance genes, suggesting they may carry conjugative transposons of the tn <dig> family in which erm and tet are linked  <cit> ,whereas  <dig> harboured tet/erm associated with other resistance genes. in the remaining isolate, the erm, mef, tet and tet genes were all detected. mef and tet linkage has been previously reported in co-resistant isolates  <cit> . in the present work, mef appeared associated with other macrolide resistance genes and linked to tet  or to tet/tet . the main emm/t type detected in coresistant isolates was emm11t <dig> . this emm/t type has previously been associated with co-resistance  <cit>  with an erm/tet clone prevalent among spanish mlsb isolates  <cit> . four isolates with this genotype were found in the present work, but we can not confirm whether they belong to the above clone.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the resistance against erythromycin, single or together to tetracycline, is due to a wide combination of resistance genes in spanish gas. erythromycin resistance is mainly consequence of clonal spread of emm4t <dig>  emm75t <dig>  both associated with m phenotype and smai non-restricted, and emm28t <dig>  whereas tetracycline resistance and coresistance is due to clonal spread of emm77t <dig> and emm11t <dig>  respectively, all smai restricted.
