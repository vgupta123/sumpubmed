BACKGROUND
head and neck/oral squamous cell carcinoma  is a complex disease arising in various organs, including oral cavity, tongue, pharynx, and larynx. tumors from these different sites have distinct clinical presentations and clinical outcomes, and are associated with different risk factors  <cit>  and genetic characteristics  <cit> . in this study, we focused on the oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas , one of the most common sites for hnosccs. the incidence of otscc is actually increasing in young and middle age groups  <cit> . otscc is significantly more aggressive than other forms of hnosccs, with a propensity for rapid local invasion and spread  <cit> .

cancer cells harbor genetic alterations which are translated into unique expression patterns. these patterns may segregate cancer cells from normal tissue of the same origin and serve as a molecular biomarker. moreover, expression pattern changes may occur far earlier than clinical disease detection. the identification of such patterns has significant translational values for early detection and diagnosis, as well as for identifying novel therapeutic targets. while several recent studies have attempted to identify expression patterns for hnosccs  <cit> , to our knowledge, no study has been devoted to identify the unique expression pattern for otscc. in this study, we aim to identify the specific transcriptomic/expression patterns that associated with otscc.

RESULTS
genome-wide gene expression profiles were obtained on  <dig> otscc samples and  <dig> normal matching samples. principal component analysis  was performed based on all the probesets utilized in our microarray analysis. apparent separation between otscc and normal groups was observed with a few outliers . genes showing statistically significant differences in expression level were identified using rma and a mixed-effects model as described in the materials and methods section. a signature gene set that consists of  <dig> genes was created using stringent statistical criteria  . comprehensive lists of genes showing statistically significant upregulations  or downregulations in expression in otscc were presented in supplement table s <dig>  and s <dig> , respectively.

* the complete lists of upregulated and downregulated transcripts in otsccs were presented in supplement table s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively.

in this study, we identified and validated several interesting potential biomarkers for otscc diagnosis. one interesting observation is that  <dig> members of the matrix metalloproteinase  family  are among the genes that most significantly upregulated, which may contribute to the aggressive nature of the otscc. mmps are a large family of proteinases which remodel extracellular matrix  components and play a significant role in tumor development, survival, invasion and metastasis  <cit> . several members of the mmp family have been considered to be important biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis as well as potential therapeutic targets for many types of cancers, including hnoscc  <cit> . our recent study suggested that up regulation of the mmp <dig> gene is associated with advanced otscc and has predictive value for the identification of lymph node metastasis  <cit> . here, our data further suggested that mmp <dig> is one of the biomarkers for the detection of otscc. we also observed  <dig> chemokines  to be among the most significantly upregulated genes in otscc. the increase in the protein and mrna of il <dig> gene has been suggested as a biomarker for the early detection of oral cancer  <cit> . our data provided independent validation for this biomarker at the disease tissue level, and suggested that the increase of il <dig> molecules  is due at least in part to the increased expression of gene in the disease tissues. cxcl <dig>  also known as growth-regulated oncogene  <dig> , is vital for the survival, progression and invasion of several cancer types  <cit> , including oral cancer  <cit> . our results here further confirmed the importance of cxcl <dig> in the tumorgenesis of tongue cancer. other interesting observations include the up-regulation of krt <dig>  and down-regulation of krt <dig> , suggesting the potentially distinct roles of krt genes in tongue scc development and progression. in addition to those identified biomarkers, our results will also serve as a valuable reference data set for future development and validation of biomarkers for detection, diagnosis and prognosis of tongue cancer.

to test the utility of this 35-gene signature gene set for classifying otscc and normal groups, average linkage hierarchical clustering analysis was performed. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  our results demonstrated that this 35-gene set provides classification power for otscc based on gene expression analyses, which misclassified two cases for each of two groups .

our analysis demonstrated that otscc can be identified based on the gene expression signature. this finding should provide a foundation for the creation of a specific screen tool for otscc. one of the major factors accounting for the poor outcome of otscc patients is that a great proportion of oral cancers are diagnosed at advanced stages. patients diagnosed at an early stage of the disease typically have a better chance for cure and functional outcome. early detection of tongue cancer lesion will greatly improve patient survival and the quality of life. current clinical diagnosis and histopathologic examinations are usually based on biopsied material, which requires invasive procedures and surgical techniques. the emerging technology of saliva-based diagnosis may provide an alternative strategy for early diagnosis and screening of the subjects at risk  <cit> . the markers identified here may be suitable for the saliva-based early diagnosis and screening strategy  <cit> . additional validation studies will be needed to fully explore this possibility.

to gain a better understanding of the underlying molecular biological processes that dictate the observed expressional pattern alterations in otscc development, the gene ontology analysis was performed. it was carried out using the gostats package in the bioconductor  <cit>  and gene ontology consortium database  <cit> , based on the complete list of  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts . among those  <dig> genes,  <dig> were mapped to entrez genes. the gene universe in the analysis consists of  <dig> transcripts that were mapped to entrez genes. the gene ontology analysis suggested a number of altered biological processes in otscc. these include enhancement in phosphate transport, collagen catabolism, i-kappab kinase/nf-kappab signaling cascade, extracellular matrix organization and biogenesis, chemotaxis, as well as suppression of superoxide release, hydrogen peroxide metabolism, cellular response to hydrogen peroxide, keratinization, keratinocyte differentiation in otsccs . the complete lists of enhanced and suppressed biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components in otsccs were presented in supplement table s <dig>  and s <dig> , respectively.

* the complete lists of enhanced and suppressed biological processes , molecular functions  and cellular components  in otsccs were presented in supplement table s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively.

** the percent of genes exhibiting expressional changes among all genes that constitutes a specific go entity.

among the identified alteration in biological activities in otscc, the most significantly enhanced are related to the extracellular matrix remodeling , i-kappab kinase/nf-kappab cascade  and chemotaxis , which are known to be related to tumorgenesis and progression of the cancer. one interesting observation is the enhancement in phosphate transport  in otscc. this may be related directly to the enhanced metabolic activity and energy consumption rate in otsccs. it has also been suggested that phosphate can act as a signaling molecule on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase   <cit>  and adenylate cyclase/camp signaling pathways  <cit> , and ultimately affect cell growth. however, the precise role of enhanced phosphate transport in tumorgenesis is largely unclear. the significantly suppressed biological activities, such as superoxide release , hydrogen peroxide metabolism , and response to hydrogen peroxide  are all appeared to be related to the cellular redox state. the effects of redox state in malignancies are somewhat contradictory. in theory, reducing the oxidative stress may prevent dna degeneration and therefore prevent the development of cancer. however, doing so may also offer increased growth potential to tumor cells and protect them from excess of reactive oxygen species , which would otherwise lead to apoptosis or necrosis. at the center of this apparent controversy is superoxide dismutase  <dig> , which has been considered as one of the most important antioxidant enzymes. the role of sods in carcinogenesis has been widely studied but is still rather ambiguous. while the majority of in vitro studies have reported a protective role of sod <dig> against tumor progression in cancer cell lines  <cit> , including oral cancer cell lines  <cit> , the in vivo studies indicate more complicated roles. increased sod <dig> levels have been observed from esophageal, gastric, brain astrocytic and colorectal carcinomas, and often associated with metastasis and poor prognosis  <cit> . the status of sod <dig> in breast cancer is not clear, with some studies showing an increase  <cit> , while others showing a decrease in sod <dig> level  <cit> . reduction in sod <dig> level has been observed in prostatic carcinomas  <cit> . our microarray results indicated a significant increase in expression of sod <dig> gene  in otscc. these findings are in agreement with the recent observation in oral cancer  <cit> . additional studies will be needed to fully understand the role of redox state and sod <dig> in otscc.

to visualize the changes in gene expression patterns in relationship with the alteration of biological processes and cellular functions in otscc, gene expression heat maps for each identified go entities were generated based on the microarray results of  <dig> otscc and  <dig> normal samples . apparent differences in expression patterns can be observed between otscc and normal groups for all the altered go entities. the summarized statistical values on differential expression for each individual gene of go: <dig>  and go: <dig>  are presented in table  <dig>  the complete expressional analysis for all the altered biological processes identified in table  <dig> is presented in supplement table s <dig> .

among these differentially expressed genes, some have potential value as diagnosis and prognosis markers, and may be indicative of their respective biological pathways. for example, il <dig> is a prototypical chemokine  and is known for its involvements in the positive regulation of chemotaxis , which is enhanced in tongue cancers as indicated by our gene ontology analysis. il <dig> has also been suggested to be a potential biomarker for the early detection of oral cancer  <cit> . the over-expression of the mmp <dig> gene has been shown to be associated with progression of oral dysplasia to cancer  <cit> . our recent study suggested that over-expression of the mmp <dig> gene is associated with advanced otscc and has predictive value for otscc lymph node metastasis  <cit> . the upregulation of mmp <dig> in otscc is also involved in the enhanced collagen catabolism , as indicated by our gene ontology analysis. the qrt-pcr analyze were performed to validate the expressional differences of the il <dig> and mmp <dig> genes between tongue sccs and normal matching tissues. as shown in figure 4a and 4b, the differences of both il <dig> and mmp <dig> mrna levels are statistically significant  between otscc and normal tissues. the expression of mmp <dig> and il <dig> was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry tests performed using monoclonal antibody to il <dig> and mmp <dig> on  <dig> otscc cases . strong positive stained scc cells were observed in  <dig> cases for il <dig> and  <dig> cases for mmp <dig>  the observation of positive staining of il <dig> in otscc cells confirmed that scc cells are one of the major sources of il <dig> production at the site of oral cancer lesion.

CONCLUSIONS
the hnosccs are a diverse group of cancers, that develop from many different anatomic sites and are associated with different risk factors  <cit>  and genetic characteristics  <cit> . this is the first high-resolution genomic profiling study to our knowledge that has focused on identifying unique expression patterns for tongue cancer . otscc is one of the most common types of hnoscc, and is significantly more aggressive than other forms of hnosccs, with a propensity for rapid local invasion and spread  <cit> . recent epidemiological studies suggested that the incidence of otscc is actually increasing in young and middle age groups  <cit> . in this study, we utilized a relatively large sample size , which enabled us to capture a precise picture of the genome-wide expression pattern for this disease. it is possible that the genomic portrait of hnoscc originating from different anatomic sites may be different. more studies will be needed to address this important question.

in summary, we identified the unique expression pattern for otscc. several interesting candidate genes associated with otscc were identified. the gene ontology analysis indicated that several biological processes and cellular functions are consistently altered in otscc. our results demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing biomarkers discovered by global expression profiling analyses for the detection and diagnosis of otscc. in addition, we also provided a valuable reference dataset for future identification and validation of biomarkers for detection, diagnosis and prognosis of otscc.
