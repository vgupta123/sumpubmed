BACKGROUND
gene duplications are a common source of evolutionary novelties  <cit> . genome sequence analysis has shown that chromosomal fragments can become duplicated either in tandem or dispersed across chromosomes. the generic term “segmental duplications” has been coined for this form of duplication, and it is thought to have been particularly active in the primate lineage—especially in humans  <cit> . these duplications are associated with rapid structural changes, chromosomal instability and evolutionary rearrangements. the size of the duplicated regions ranges between one to several hundred kilobases. approximately  <dig> delimited blocks of the human genome have been identified as regions for multiple duplications during hominoid evolution. in general, segmental duplications comprise about 5% of the human genome  <cit>  and  <cit> .

some of the segmentally duplicated genomic regions are clustered around “core” duplication blocks   <cit> . the corresponding genes and gene families encoded by these core duplicons are different from classical segmentally duplicated gene families. most of these core sequences show ubiquitous or global patterns of expression versus the ancestral locus  <cit> . some of the most variable human cnv genes correspond to recently evolved gene families with embedded human core duplicons  <cit> . hence, it seems possible that gene families found with such core duplicons may be associated with specific adaptations during the evolution of the human lineage within the primate phylogeny . however, only one of these recently duplicated gene families, tbc1d <dig>  has been functionally characterized so far and was found to regulate egf signaling .

we focus here on the spata <dig> gene family , which is one of the fastest evolving gene families in the human lineage  <cit> . it belongs to the human core duplicon families  <cit> , and it evolved from a single copy gene in mammals. spata <dig> in mice  interacts with syntaxin and beta actin  <cit> . knock-out mice are infertile due to a reduced number of sperm cells suggesting a role of the gene in mouse spermatogenesis  <cit> . we present here a comparative analysis between mice, old world monkeys  and hominoids . we show that the spata <dig> gene family expanded within the great apes by segmental duplication from one copy in mice to two copies in macaque and to multiple functional and non-functional copies along chromosome  <dig> in hominoid primates and humans. the spata <dig> gene in primates acquired new upstream sequences that have led to broader expression and new protein domains suggesting an involvement in sensing and/or repairing uv damage. we provide experimental evidence in cell cultures that support this hypothesis.

RESULTS
gene duplication patterns
we conducted a detailed analysis of gene structure evolution and duplication patterns of spata <dig> based on genome sequence comparisons. the mouse harbors a single copy of the spata <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig>  in the macaque, there are two copies of spata31: type a and type c. both expanded along chromosome  <dig> in humans . there are other members of the gene family  sharing a fam75a domain, but they are otherwise much more diverged  and are not considered further here.fig.  <dig> 
spata <dig> gene family expansion in humans. the gene structure and chromosome localization of spata <dig> genes based on the human reference , rhesus macaque  and mouse  genomes are shown. the mouse harbors a single copy that has duplicated and diverged into an a and a c type in macaque. further segmental duplications are found in humans on chromosome 9




type a has seven segmental duplications in humans , of which one is a clear pseudogene due to multiple stop codons . another encodes a truncated protein  due to a frameshift mutation resulting in a premature stop codon in exon  <dig> . note that the annotation around spata31a <dig> and spata31a <dig> is uncertain because short non-sequenced regions interrupt the region. type c has two copies in the human genome—each is preceded by a duplication of the first exon including the promoter sequence . however, these additional promoters do not appear to initiate transcripts. the gene lengths and the protein coding regions of spata <dig> genes differ between a and c types. the predicted molecular weights are  <dig> kd for the a type  and  <dig> kd for the c type .

to trace the expansion of the family, we assessed copy numbers in fully sequenced genomes of sequenced individuals from macaque, orangutan, chimps and twelve humans including us_ishim, denisovan and neandertal. the results show that there was on average a progressive increase of segmental duplications of the spata <dig> gene locus towards humans .

a detailed comparison of the promoter regions including line/l <dig>  elements revealed that there are two different general promoter structures shared by all spata31a and spata31c genes respectively . in particular, the promoter region of spata31c was subjected to multiple rounds of rearrangement resulting in a composite promoter structure consisting of three line/l <dig>  md, mer31a, pa <dig>  three aluy and one erv <dig> elements. in contrast, the functional spata31a promoters are composed of line/l1-p <dig> and pa <dig> retroviral elements . the main expansion of the pa <dig> element occurred about  <dig> mya and the expansion of the p <dig> element occurred about  <dig> mya . accordingly, no p <dig> element is detected in the promoter regions of new world monkeys. an insertion of a ccccct simple repeat is observed in gorillas, chimpanzees and humans at the time where the main expansion of the family is observed. thus, we propose that the promoter region of spata31a was restructured in a stepwise manner by integration of line and a ccccct simple repeat within the primate phylogeny .fig.  <dig> evolutionary emergence of the human spata <dig> gene promoter structures. phylogenetic reconstruction of full length spata <dig> proteins  in different primates, cat, dog, rat and mouse species using the nj method  <cit>  with bootstrap values  indicated at the branches  <cit> . species names are: rat , mouse , cat , dog , tarsius , marmoset , saimiri , baboon , rhesus macaque , gibbon , orangutan , gorilla , chimpanzee  and human . repetitive elements line/l1-pa <dig> , line/l1-p <dig>  and n  that were found within the spata31a promoter region are indicated with an arrow to show approximate integration time




fig.  <dig> also includes phylogenetic comparisons of the a and c-type copies in humans and chimpanzees. the respective duplicated copies for each type are more similar within each species than between the two species. this is a clear sign of concerted evolution of the gene family within each species  <cit> . in case of segmentally duplicated genes, this would occur most likely by frequent gene conversion events such that the duplicated copies retain higher similarity within their evolutionary lineage.

protein domain evolution
motif scans and multiple alignment analysis  predict that there are several domain structures present in spata <dig> proteins and that they differ between the subtypes and between primates  and mouse . all share a fam75a domain in the middle, a nuclear localization signal in the n-terminal part of the protein and a pcna-interacting domain at the c-terminus. the primate genes have a cryptochrome/photolyase domain and a proline rich region. spata31a has a dna topoisomerase domain and a further nuclear localization signal in the middle of the protein. the mouse spata <dig> protein has an alkaline phosphatase and a trr-like domain that is not found in the primate proteins . the spata <dig> gene family also shows similarities to epstein barr virus –bplf <dig> and cry <dig> proteins , and we found through antibody staining  partial co-localization with cry <dig> protein . cry <dig> is one of the circadian clock proteins involved in blue light-dependent regulation of the circadian feedback loop  <cit> . cryptochromes play an important role in intrinsic apoptosis induced by uv mimetic and radiometric compounds  <cit> . ebv-bplf <dig> protein has been implicated to interact with pcna and to delay the dna trans-lesion synthesis  repair mechanism  <cit> . the tls repair mechanism was also shown to be important during uv irradiation-induced dna damage repair  <cit> . hence, the n-terminal region of the spata <dig> proteins acquired several important functional domains compatible with the acquisition of an uv response when compared to the mouse spata <dig> proteins.fig.  <dig> domain patterns of spata <dig> proteins. protein domain patterns of mouse spata <dig> , human spata31a <dig>  and human spata31c <dig>  based on comparative genomics, smart protein database  and motif search . protein domains are depicted with colored boxes . note that the human domain structure is the same as in the other primates including macaque. see additional file  <dig> for details of the domain descriptions and definitions




copy number variation of spata31a
to determine copy number variation for the spata31a genes in human populations we used genomic dna panels for a subset of individuals that were also used in the  <dig>  genomes project. we genotyped  <dig> samples from the mgp <dig> , mgp <dig> , mgp <dig>  and mgp <dig>  panels from the nhgri repository at cornell using digital pcr with spata31a-specific primers. we found on average around  <dig>  copies per diploid genome, with a range between  <dig>  to  <dig>  copies on the extremes . there were no obvious differences between the means of each population, but there were differences in the breadth of distribution with the highest in the chinese population , finnish , kenyan , yoruban ) .fig.  <dig> copy number variation of spata31a in human populations. copy numbers of individuals were estimated based on digital pcr and then binned into number classes 




rna and protein expression
we used rt-pcr to assess the expression of spata <dig>  in different mouse and human tissues. we found that the mouse expresses the gene only in the testis, while humans show expression in multiple tissues . such an expansion of expression into other tissue types was also seen for the segmentally duplicated morpheus  <cit>  and lrrc <dig> genes  <cit> ,  <cit>  and in primates  <cit> . the differences in expression may be associated with the observed restructuring of the spata31a/c gene and the promoter region by repetitive elements during the evolution of primates . however, quantitative pcr showed that even in humans the highest level of expression is still in the testis—expression in other tissues is still quite low .fig.  <dig> expression analysis of spata <dig> rna and protein within human primary fibroblast  cells. a rt-pcr analysis on cdna isolated from total human rna  and from mouse rna. the pcr primers were designed to amplify the highly conserved region within the long coding exon for human. for mouse, we amplified a region spanning exons 1– <dig>  the ube <dig> gene was used as control. quantitative pcr for the same tissue samples is shown in additional file  <dig>  b antibody staining of hff cells with fixation under dark conditions versus a treatment with 200 j/m <dig> uvc and 24 h further growth at two different magnifications . nuclei in the first column are stained with dapi , and spata <dig> staining is shown in the second column . in the third column, the green staining in the 63x pictures is cellular cytoskeleton detected with an antibody against tubulin and in the 100x columns the nucleolus with an antibody against per <dig>  <cit> . see additional file  <dig> for further quantification of spata <dig> response of re-localization upon different exposure to uvc. we noted some variation of relative spata <dig> protein localization between cytoplasm and the nucleus depending on the cell cycle and fixation protocol as well as dark–light conditions during fixation similar to other uv response proteins such as h2ax 




we raised an antibody against peptides shared by the a and c types to assess the protein localization at the sub-cellular level . we found that during mitosis the spata <dig> protein accumulates around the spindle . in lung and sinus tissue, the protein is mostly expressed in the epithelial layer, but almost all of the cells show expression in tonsil tissue . we focused most of the further analysis on human foreskin fibroblasts , which represent primary and non-immortalized cells of the ectoderm. here, spata <dig> proteins are primarily localized to the nucleus with an enhanced staining seen in the nucleolus—especially under dark conditions .

based on the domain and similarity analyses above, we reasoned that spata <dig> protein may be involved directly or indirectly in the repair pathway of uv-induced dna damage and/or for the recruitment of the dna repair molecules to damaged sites via its pcna interaction domain. therefore, we exposed various human cell lines to different strength and time intervals of uvc light. we found a consistent shift and/or upregulation from nucleolar localization to a spread across the entire nucleus in these experiments . this effect was also seen in other proteins involved in uv damage repair  <cit> .

spata <dig> function
to investigate the molecular function of spata31a/c genes, we targeted exon  <dig> of the spata31a/c genes via crispr/cas mediated mutagenesis  <cit>   in human foreskin fibroblast cells . we did not expect to obtain a full knockout because we were targeting a multi-copy gene; rather, the goal was a reduction in functional gene numbers. to estimate the types and frequencies of mutations induced across different copies, we amplified fragments around the expected lesion and sequenced them via illumina sequencing. this allowed us to identify single cell clones with low and high frame shift mutation numbers . for further analysis, we selected one of the best growing cell lines from each class, cl <dig>  and cl <dig>  using untreated hff cells as control.

we tested whether the mutated cell lines would show an effect with respect to uv-induced cell damage and death. both the cl <dig> and the cl <dig> cells had elevated sensitivity to uvc treatment compared to control. stronger effects were seen in the cl <dig> cells . using digital pcr analysis we found that the two different hff cell lines had incidentally a natural difference in copy number. cell line hf <dig> has eight copies of spata31a and three of spata31c; cell line hf <dig> has nine spata31a copies and four spata31c . we compared these two cell lines in the same uv damage test and found that the one with more copies is somewhat less sensitive to uvc irradiation .fig.  <dig> increased uv sensitivity of mutated hff cells. to assess the uvc sensitivity, we used the ldh cytotoxicity assay to measure the release of ldh from damaged or dead cells. this is a very sensitive cell toxicity test  <cit>  and  <cit> . a differences between controls and mutated cells between the two types of mutated cell lines, cl <dig>  and cl <dig>  and non-mutated control cells. b differences between the low copy cell line hff <dig> and the high copy cell line hff <dig>  p-values of student’s t test are indicated as * <  <dig> , ** <  <dig> , and *** <  <dig> 




CONCLUSIONS
the spermatogenesis phenotype of spata <dig> knockout in mice  <cit>  suggests that the ancestral function of spata <dig> is in the pathway of sperm formation. it is currently unknown whether it retained this function in humans, but the high expression in human testis points to an involvement in spermatogenesis as well. however, spata <dig> has clearly also acquired new functions in the primate lineage. its acquisition of a cryptochrome/photolyase domain may allow it to sense uv light, although photolyase domains are so far only known from circadian clock functions where they sense blue light  <cit> . further, it may recruit other dna repair genes through its topoisomerase domain and the pcna interacting motif by opening the chromatin structure.

given that increasing exposure to uv light would have played a role in primate and hominoid diurnal evolution, it is likely that the original acquisition of new functions is connected to the increased exposure to sunlight. the further expansion into multiple copies in the line towards humans may have had the same reason. humans in particular got exposed to more uv light in conjunction with loosing their body hair. but this would have been dependent on skin color and the parts of the world where they lived. this could explain why there is still copy number variation at this locus. however, these explanations remain necessarily speculative and require deeper population analysis in humans as well as further functional studies.
