BACKGROUND
streptococcus agalactiae or group b streptococcus  is the major cause of invasive neonatal infections in industrialized countries  <cit> . early and late onset disease in infants of  <dig> to  <dig> or at least  <dig> days old, respectively, are characterized by sepsis and meningitis. early onset disease usually results from mother-to-child transmission and can be prevented through intrapartum chemoprophylaxis. the routine use of screening protocols and intrapartum chemoprophylaxis has led to decrease in the incidence of early onset disease, whereas the incidence of late onset disease is not affected  <cit> . streptococcus agalactiae also causes a considerable burden of disease in adults, with case fatality rates approximating 15% in countries in north america, asia and europe  <cit> . the incidence of gbs disease in non-pregnant adults has increased in recent years  <cit> . in adults, s. agalactiae may cause meningitis or septicaemia as well as localized infections such as subcutaneous abscesses, urinary tract infection or arthritis  <cit> . the drivers behind emergence of s. agalactiae disease in adults are poorly understood.

to study the epidemiology of s. agalactiae, numerous molecular methods have been used. this includes comparative typing methods, such as pulsed field gel electrophoresis , which is suitable for outbreak investigations  <cit> . for population genetic analyses, highly standardized and portable typing methods are preferable, e.g. multilocus sequence typing , which targets the core genome, or 3-set genotyping, which targets the accessory genome content of s. agalactiae <cit> . mlst is an important tool for molecular epidemiology because the mlst databases for individual pathogen species currently cover far more isolates than have been characterized based on whole genome sequencing  <cit> . similarly, isolates that have been characterized by 3-set genotyping still outnumber isolates that have been characterized by whole genome sequencing, thus providing a less detailed but broader frame of reference than offered by whole genome sequences. mlst is an unambiguous method based on sequencing of the internal portion of selected housekeeping genes  <cit> . it is used to define sequence types , which may be associated with specific disease syndromes. for example, st <dig> is more prevalent among isolates from invasive disease in infants than among carriage isolates from pregnant adults  <cit> . three-set genotyping encompasses molecular serotyping  and profiling of surface protein genes and mobile genetic elements , and allows for further differentiation of isolates belonging to the same st  <cit> . for example, st <dig> isolates with molecular serotype iii- <dig>  c-α protein and c-α protein repeating units and the mges is <dig>  issag <dig>  and issag <dig> are associated with the emergence of gbs meningitis in adults in southeast asia  <cit> .

invasive disease due to s. agalactiae is not limited to humans. other species affected include terrestrial mammals such as cattle, dogs and cats  <cit>  and aquatic or semi-aquatic species such as sea mammals  <cit> , crocodiles  <cit> , bullfrogs  <cit>  and fish  <cit> . outbreaks of streptococcosis due to s. agalactiae have been described in wild fish, e.g. in mullet in kuwait bay  <cit>  and in giant queensland grouper and other wild fish in australia  <cit> . s. agalactiae is also a major pathogen in farmed fish, particularly in tilapia  <cit> . consumption of fish has been associated with an increased risk of s. agalactiae serotype ia and ib colonization in people  <cit> . furthermore, mlst, molecular serotyping and challenge studies have shown that invasive disease in humans and fish may be caused by the same strains of s. agalactiae <cit> . the aim of the current paper is to enhance our knowledge of the molecular epidemiology of s. agalactiae in fish and other aquatic species, with emphasis on use of standardized typing systems that cover housekeeping genes as well as virulence genes and that allow for assessment of transmission potential between aquatic species and humans based on comparison with existing databases.

methods
isolate collection and identification
a collection of  <dig> s. agalactiae isolates recovered from aquatic hosts was assembled, including isolates from poikilothermic and homeothermic host species originating from multiple countries and continents . of  <dig> isolates,  <dig> represented  <dig> separate disease outbreaks  with the remaining  <dig> isolates each representing a single, unrelated outbreak or death. thus, isolates in this study represented  <dig> epidemiologically independent events. most fish isolates  originated from infections in farmed tilapia  from honduras, colombia, costa rica, belgium, thailand and vietnam. the remaining fish isolates originated from infections in wild klunzinger’s mullets  that were part of an outbreak of streptococcosis in kuwait or from ornamental fish from australia, namely a rosy barb , a golden ram  and an undetermined fish species. sea mammal isolates  were recovered at post-mortem from lung swabs of  <dig> bottlenose dolphin  and  <dig> grey seals  that had stranded at various sites around the coast of scotland. finally, one amphibian isolate originating from an infected farmed bullfrog  in thailand was available for molecular characterisation.

bacterial isolates were streaked onto 5% sheep blood agar plates  and grown aerobically at  <dig> to 28°c for 48h in order to assess purity and haemolysis properties. this temperature is commonly used for culture of s. agalactiae from fish  <cit> . isolates were checked for gram reaction and morphology and tested in a group b-specific latex agglutination test . single colonies were transferred to brain heart infusion  broth  and incubated with gentle shaking at 28°c for 12h  or 48h . species identity of s. agalactiae was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction , using forward primer stra-agi  and reverse primer stra-agii , which target the 16s to 23s rrna intergenic spacer region  <cit> . broth cultures were also used for pfge as described below.

comparative typing: pfge
bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation of  <dig> ml of incubated bhi, re-suspended in  <dig>  ml of te buffer , warmed to 56°c and mixed with  <dig>  ml of 2%  low-melting point agarose  in te buffer. the mixture was then pipetted into reusable plug moulds  producing  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig>  mm <dig> agarose blocks. each solidified plug was placed into  <dig> ml of te buffer containing  <dig> mg of lysozyme   and incubated overnight at 37°c with gentle shaking. the buffer was then replaced with  <dig> ml of es buffer  n-lauroyl sarcosine ) supplemented with  <dig> mg of proteinase k   and incubated at 56°c for a minimum of  <dig> hr. plugs were washed  <dig> times for  <dig> hr in te buffer at room temperature and with gentle shaking. a slice  from each plug was exposed to digestion with restriction endonuclease smai  at 25°c overnight. pfge was performed with a chef-mapper system  in  <dig>  × tbe using a 1%  agarose gel , a run time of  <dig> hr and switch time of 3- <dig> s  at 14°c. patterns were observed by uv transillumination after sybr gold staining . computer-assisted data analysis and dendogram construction were performed with phoretix 1d pro software . similarities between pfge patterns were also assessed visually using standard criteria  <cit> .

housekeeping genes: multilocus sequence typing
mlst consisted of the amplification by pcr and sequencing of seven housekeeping genes, namely adhp, atr, glck, glna, phes, sdha, and tkt <cit> . consensus sequences were trimmed in seqman , and the s. agalactiae database  <cit>  was used for allele and sequence type  assignments. sequences of novel alleles were submitted to the database curator for allocation of new allele numbers and sts; these are now available in the database. the unweighted pair group method in phyilip and phylodendron was used to visualize the relationship between allelic profiles obtained from the isolates. the complete allelic profile list from the s. agalactiae mlst database was downloaded   <cit>  and eburst groups were identified based on sharing of  <dig> out of  <dig> alleles using standard eburst methodology  <cit> . in addition, a population snapshot of the entire s. agalactiae population was created in eburst to show the position of sts from our study in relation to all known sts, which predominantly originate from isolates of human origin. finally, for sts that were identified in the current study and that did not form part of an eburst group, the existence of double locus variants  and triple locus variants  was explored via st query in the s. agalactiae mlst database  <cit> .

virulence genes: three-set genotyping
a 3-set genotyping system, comprising ms, surface protein gene profiles and mge profiles, was used. molecular serotyping was performed using multiplex-pcr assays  <cit> . non-typeable  isolates were further investigated using other primer sets  <cit>  and serosubtyping of ms iii isolates was performed  <cit> . presence of surface protein genes was determined by pcr and sequencing of pcr products, using primers targeting the bca, bac, alp <dig>  alp <dig>  alp <dig> and alp <dig> genes  <cit> . finally, the prevalence of  <dig> mge, corresponding to  <dig> group ii intron  and  <dig> insertion sequences  was evaluated by pcr and amplicon identity was confirmed by sequencing of pcr products  <cit> .

RESULTS
isolate collection and identification
all isolates were lancefield group b, gram-positive cocci appearing in pairs and chains. they were either β-haemolytic or non-haemolytic on sheep blood agar . all were confirmed as s. agalactiae by species-specific pcr.

pfge analysis
all isolates were typeable by smai macrorestriction and  <dig> pulsotypes were identified. pulsotypes were indistinguishable when multiple isolates from a single outbreak were analysed. in some cases, pulsotypes were also indistinguishable for isolates from different host species or countries, e.g. for bullfrog and tilapia isolates from thailand or for tilapia isolates from honduras, colombia and costa rica . despite efforts to identify potential epidemiological relationships between farms sharing the same pulsotype, e.g. through shared broodstock or feed companies, no such links could be identified and each outbreak is considered to be epidemiologically independent.

mlst and eburst analysis
among the  <dig> s. agalactiae isolates,  <dig> sts were observed, including  <dig> new sts, i.e. st <dig> and st <dig> . the new sts were slvs of known sts and resulted from single nucleotide changes. sts were identical when multiple isolates from a single outbreak were analysed. in several cases, sts were also identical between isolates from epidemiologically unrelated animal deaths, outbreaks, countries or host species. for example, st <dig> was associated with three epidemiologically unrelated fish death in australia; st <dig> was found in tilapia from honduras, colombia and costa rica; and st <dig> was found in a bullfrog and tilapia from thailand and in mullet from kuwait . the st <dig> isolates from thailand originated from  <dig> provinces  and were epidemiologically unrelated. the two st <dig> isolates from thailand originated from tilapia farms in mukdahan province and phetchaburi province, respectively.

e-burst analysis  showed that all piscine isolates from asia and the middle-east and the frog isolate from asia  belonged to  <dig> related subgroups, both of which are part of eburst group  <dig>  the bottlenose dolphin isolate from the uk  also belonged to eburst group  <dig>  this large eburst group includes a number of major subgroups that used to be separate eburst groups or clonal complexes . for ease of reference and comparison with the literature, such subgroups or subccs are indicated in the figure and subsequent text by their founding st. all grey seal isolates from the uk belonged to st <dig>  which is the founder of eburst group  <dig> or cc <dig> and not related to st <dig> or st <dig>  piscine isolates from latin america  were part of a small eburst group that also includes st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> . the most likely founder of this eburst group is st <dig> and the group is also referred to as cc <dig>  based on additional analysis of dlvs, st <dig> and st <dig> may also be related to cc <dig> whilst st <dig> is a tlv of cc <dig> .

three-set genotyping
using the method of evans and colleagues  <cit> , isolates were identified as serotype ia, ib or nt. further investigation of nt isolates with additional primer sets  <cit>  showed that the isolates belonged to serotype iii subserotype  <dig>  based on the combination of serotype, surface protein genes and mge, seven 3-set genotypes were distinguished . three-set genotypes were identical when multiple isolates from a single outbreak were analysed. piscine and amphibian isolates from asia and the middle-east and all mammalian isolates were positive for is <dig> and issag <dig>  is <dig> was always found in combination with gbsii and vice versa but rarely in combination with issag <dig>  issag <dig> was found in all mammalian isolates tested but only  <dig> of  <dig> epidemiologically independent non-mammalian isolates carried issag <dig>  when the cβ protein gene  was present, it was always found in association with the cα protein gene  but bca could also present in the absence of bac . piscine isolates from latin america , australia  and europe , all shared serotype ib  but none of the surface protein genes or mge investigated in this study were detected in any of these isolates.

comparison across methods
all β-haemolytic isolates  belonged to ccs that are also found in humans and carried at least  <dig> mges . each cc correlated with a pfge cluster, although mlst could be more discriminatory than pfge and vice versa. for example, multiple pfge types were identified in st <dig> and in st <dig> . conversely, multiple sts were identified within pfge types in cc <dig>  and cc <dig> . results from 3-set genotyping were concordant with mlst and pfge typing and origin of isolates. all isolates from cc <dig>  carried at least  <dig> surface protein genes and  <dig> mges , which is more than was observed in any other cc in this study. within cc <dig>  the dolphin isolate was the most divergent isolate based on mlst, pfge typing, serotyping and number of surface protein genes. the dolphin isolate and the outbreak strain from kuwait had one extra mge, issag <dig>  compared with isolates from thailand , which were identical to each other in 3-set genotype. isolates in cc <dig>  and cc <dig>  carried the same mges  but differed from each other in presence of surface protein genes. within cc <dig>  two closely related pfge clusters were observed that corresponded with presence or absence of the surface protein gene alp <dig>  all non-haemolytic isolates  belonged to sts that have not been identified in humans and none of these isolates carried any of the surface protein genes or mges that were examined .

discussion
streptococcus agalactiae from sea mammals, fish and a frog belonged to  <dig> subpopulations based on a combination of two standardized typing methods which target the core genome and the accessory genome, respectively. of the  <dig> subpopulations that were identified,  <dig> have also been found in humans, both as carriage strains and as the cause of invasive disease in neonates or adults, whilst to date the fourth one has only been reported from poikilothermic animals.

s. agalactiae cc <dig> is associated with invasive disease in humans and fish
st <dig> with molecular serotype iii- <dig> has been associated with invasive disease in non-pregnant adults in hong kong  <cit>  and was isolated from fish in thailand in our study. isolates from humans and fish also shared the presence of the c-alpha encoding gene as well as identical mge profiles. the same 3-set genotype was found in an slv of st <dig>  the novel st <dig>  which was isolated from fish in vietnam in our study. st <dig> and another one of its slvs, st <dig>  have previously been linked to an increase in group b streptococcal meningitis in adults in southeast asia  <cit> . in france, st <dig> serotype iii has been isolated from cases of osteoarticular disease in non-pregnant adults  <cit> . the 3-set genotype shared by human isolates from hong kong and tilapia isolates from southeast asia in our study had already been reported from tilapia in thailand, but mlst data were not published for those isolates  <cit> . the recent emergence or recognition of invasive st <dig> and its slvs in humans and fish in southeast asia suggests that there may be an epidemiological connection between the two host species, as previously described for a closely related streptococcal species, streptococcus iniae <cit> . such a connection could result from human-to-animal transmission, animal-to-human transmission or joint exposure to a shared source. further study of st <dig> and the epidemiological connection between humans and fish will be needed to elucidate potential transmission mechanisms and risks.

s. agalactiae cc <dig> is associated with carriage and disease in humans, a bullfrog, fish and dolphins
in humans, st <dig> causes invasive disease in neonates and adults  <cit>  and the pathogenicity of human st <dig> isolates to fish is well-established  <cit> . st <dig> may also occur as vaginal carriage isolates in humans  <cit> . st <dig> was held responsible for a major fish kill in kuwait bay  <cit>  and results from our study using isolates from different fish from the same outbreak confirm this. human sewage was considered a likely source of this outbreak  <cit> , a route of transmission that is consistent with commensal occurrence of strains in the human urogenital tract. we report here for the first time the detection of st <dig> in an amphibian. previous reports on the occurrence of s. agalactiae in frogs mention non-haemolytic gbs strains  <cit>  but all st <dig> isolates in our study and in previous studies of aquatic s. agalactiae were β-haemolytic. thus, it is unlikely that infections described previously in frogs were due to st <dig>  like most st <dig> isolates in our study, the frog isolate originated from thailand, where this st is common in farmed tilapia .

s. agalactiae has been isolated from captive and wild dolphins  <cit> . st <dig> was cultured from a bottlenose dolphin  that died during the kuwait bay fish kill but no definitive link between bacterial isolation and death could be established  <cit> . similarly, we describe the first case of st <dig> in a free-ranging bottlenose dolphin calf from scotland without definitive evidence of a causal association with the animal’s death, which was attributed to trauma and infanticide. st <dig> is a rare slv of st <dig> and does not appear to be closely related to st <dig> in eburst analysis of the current mlst database . however, st <dig> is a dlv of st <dig> and alternative methods, e.g. clustering of mlst data using the unweighted pair group method, suggest that st <dig> should be classified as a member of cc <dig>  <cit> . due to the low number of dolphin isolates available, it is not possible to determine whether the isolation of two cc <dig> strains from temporally and geographically unrelated dolphins is coincidental or reflective of a host predilection. like st <dig>  st <dig> may occur as a vaginal coloniser in healthy women  <cit> . thus, its presence in sea water could result from microbial contamination by human effluent.

s. agalactiae st <dig> is associated with humans and seals but not with fish
streptococcus agalactiae has been detected in grey seals  and in antarctic fur seals  but those descriptions predate the development of mlst  <cit> . s. agalactiae was identified in  <dig> grey seals under the scottish strandings scheme whereas examination of a larger number of common seals  under the same scheme failed to recover s. agalactiae, suggesting that among scottish pinnipeds, s. agalactiae has a preference for grey seals. complete molecular typing data was available for  <dig> isolates, which are included in the current study, whilst mlst data was available for the remaining  <dig> isolates. one of the grey seals had died of a systemic infectious process, whilst other animals with s. agalactiae died with signs of storm damage, hypothermia, starvation, trauma or lung emphysema, in agreement with previous studies  <cit> . all seal isolates  belonged to st <dig>  within st <dig>  molecular serotypes ia and iii predominate  <cit> . st <dig> serotype ia is linked to humans whereas st <dig> serotype iii is primarily found in dairy cattle where it is a causative agent of mastitis, inflammation of the mammary gland  <cit> . all seal isolates included in the current study  had serotype ia, suggesting a human origin. in humans, st <dig> is common as vaginal-rectal carrier strain in adults although it may also cause neonatal invasive disease  <cit> . given the predominant niche of st <dig> in humans, it is conceivable that its presence in seals is due to microbial contamination of surface water. st <dig> probably has the broadest known host range of all s. agalactiae sts. both homeothermic and poikilothermic species can be affected, including humans, cattle, dogs, crocodiles and seals  <cit> . despite the high prevalence of st <dig> in humans, its wide host range and its ability to affect aquatic mammals and semi-aquatic reptiles, there are no reports on occurrence of st <dig> in fish. this may reflect the relatively small number of fish isolates characterized to date or it may indicate true biological differences, e.g. an inability to infect fish. challenge studies using st <dig> are required to assess its ability to cause disease in fish. if st-associated differences in virulence are confirmed, comparative genomic analysis of human, fish, seal and bovine isolates may help to identify molecular correlates of virulence.

s. agalactiae st <dig> and st <dig> are associated with fish but not with humans
the final subpopulation in our collection consisted of non-haemolytic strains of s. agalactiae. non-haemolytic s. agalactiae may cause invasive disease such as endocarditis in adult humans  <cit>  but no mlst data on non-haemolytic human isolates could be found. the prevalence of non-haemolytic s. agalactiae among carriage isolates has been estimated at  <dig> to 8%, although this value may be underestimated in studies that use β-haemolyis as a diagnostic criterion for identification of the organism  <cit> . all non-haemolytic isolates in our collection belonged to serotype ib, a serotype that has been associated with β-haemolytic and non-haemolytic human isolates  <cit> . the subpopulation of non-haemolytic serotype ib isolates in our study encompassed all fish isolates that did not originate from southeast asia, suggesting an association between geographic origin and strain. the association with host species and geographic origin is not absolute, as β-haemolytic serotype ib isolates and st <dig> have also been reported from frogs  <cit>  and st <dig> has been reported in fish from indonesia  <cit> . this is the first report of st <dig> in aquarium fish, which originated from australia. outbreaks of streptococcosis in wild fish have occurred repeatedly in australia in the past few years  <cit> . the isolates causing disease in queensland grouper and other reef fish were non-haemolytic with serotype ib, suggesting that they belong to the fish-associated subpopulation of s. agalactiae. human strains, such as st <dig> or st <dig>  could come into contact with reef fish through surface water contamination by effluent or divers but would be expected to be haemolytic. it is unknown whether there is an epidemiological connection between disease in aquarium fish and reef fish, e.g. due to capture of reef fish or release of aquarium fish into the wild.

using standard eburst group definitions, st <dig> but not st <dig> is recognized as part of cc <dig> . however, st <dig> is a dlv of multiple cc <dig> members and could be considered a member of the same group . this group also includes st <dig>  which has been isolated from trout, and st <dig> and  <dig>  which have been isolated from tilapia  <cit> . st <dig>  which has been isolated from striped bass  <cit> , is loosely connected to this group, which does not include any isolates from homeothermic host species. using the 3-set genotyping system, no surface protein genes or mges were detected among isolates from this group, further supporting that it is not closely related to any of the known clonal complexes of s. agalactiae found in humans. st <dig> was recently discovered in doctor fish  that are used in foot spas to remove dead skin from people’s feet and concern has been expressed that repeated exposure of fish-adapted strains to such an environment could eventually lead to human infections  <cit> . in the laboratory, members of the group that includes st <dig> and st <dig> do not grow well at 37°c, which may explain their current absence from homeothermic species. a vaccine to protect fish from non-haemolytic s. agalactiae is commercially available, but this vaccine does not provide protection to haemolytic strains  <cit> . thus, vaccination of fish can be used to limit production losses in some situations, but it does not protect against the most commons strains in southeast asia or against zoonotic infections from fish or fish products.

CONCLUSIONS
based on standardized molecular typing of housekeeping genes and virulence genes, s. agalactiae strains that have previously been associated with asymptomatic carriage and adult invasive disease in humans can also be found in fish, frogs and sea mammals. in particular, strains belonging to st <dig>  which is a common carriage strain in humans, were associated with seals, where they may be indicators of environmental pollution rather than causative agents of disease. st <dig> was not identified in any fish. strains belonging to st <dig> were associated with a bullfrog and fish from south-east asia whilst strains belonging to st <dig> and showing the same virulence gene profile as human invasive isolates were isolated from fish in asia. this suggests that there may be exposure of humans and fish to similar environmental sources of st <dig> and st <dig>  or transmission of s. agalactiae between the different host species. finally, strains belonging to st <dig> and st <dig> were associated with fish from the americas, europe and australia. these strains, and other members of their clonal complex, have only been reported from poikilotherms. comparative genomic analysis and functional studies of strains that do not appear to affect fish, e.g. st <dig>  and strains that primarily affect fish, e.g. st <dig> and st <dig>  may provide insight into host-adaptation of s. agalactiae. epidemiological studies are needed to provide insight into the likelihood and routes of interspecies transmission of strains that are associated with fish, sea mammals and invasive disease in humans as well as control measures needed to prevent transmission and disease.
