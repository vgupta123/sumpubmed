BACKGROUND
conservation genetics is a relatively new, yet growing field of research that can have immediate impact on practical issues confronting efforts to conserve biodiversity. technical developments of molecular procedures directly applicable to genetic analysis of virtually any organism have made important contributions to these efforts. here we present a unique example of the use of molecular conservation genetics to detect genetic contamination of an otherwise successful captive breeding-repatriation program of a once critically endangered species.

the genetically distinct population of giant galápagos tortoises  occupying the island of española in the extreme southeastern region of the galápagos archipelago was in grave danger of extinction in the late 1960s due to hunting activities from sealing, whaling, and pirate ships  <cit> , as well as habitat destruction by feral goats. in response, the charles darwin research station  and galápagos national park  initiated in late 1960s a captive-breeding and reintroduction program  <cit> . by  <dig>  thorough searches across the island found only  <dig> remaining individuals  and all were transferred to the breeding centre on the island of santa cruz. in  <dig>  a third española adult male from the san diego zoo  was incorporated into the breeding program. the first tortoises whose parents originated from española hatched at cdrs in  <dig> and were subsequently released in  <dig> after completion of a goat eradication campaign. to date, more than  <dig> offspring have been repatriated, the island has undergone significant ecological recuperation, repatriated tortoises now reproduce in situ, and the core population of  <dig> parents continues to reproduce in captivity at the breeding centre.

as minimization of inbreeding is probably as important a determinant as rehabilitation of habitat for long-term survival of the repatriated population  <cit> , we previously used molecular data to assess how much of the genetic diversity of the  <dig> breeders is represented in the repatriated population  <cit> . analysis of  <dig> informative microsatellite loci allowed us to determine the captive parents of  <dig> surviving released individuals collected in 1994; at that time, this represented about 40% of the repatriated population. this analysis indicated that contributions of the  <dig> breeders are highly skewed. the large variance in reproductive success  <cit>  in combination with a severely female-biased sex ratio  <cit>  reduces the effective population size  to an alarming low value of  <dig>   <cit> . because the long-term ne is the harmonic mean across generations  <cit> , we suggested rectifying the low ne in the parental population prior to continuation of the repatriation program. indeed, estimating that ne for the current repatriated population is  <dig>  ne over the two generations would only reach  <dig> . this is an overestimate as it is based on a 60% survival rate of released offspring , and on the optimistic assumption that sex ratio and reproductive success are not biased on the island. in other words, the current orchestration of the breeding program generated inbreeding that reduced genetic variation of the current population of about  <dig> individuals to a level equivalent to that expected for, at best, a population of  <dig> unrelated individuals. inbreeding could be effectively reduced by modification of the breeding program to more nearly equalize reproductive success among breeders.

in order to fine-tune the estimate of ne and analyse its evolution through time, we collected in  <dig> and  <dig> blood samples from  <dig> additional tortoises of which  <dig> were sampled on española and  <dig> were samples of f <dig> individuals awaiting release. the latter point is of importance as it allows us to distinguish between differential reproductive success and differential survival rates  <cit> .

RESULTS
surprisingly, one individual  sampled on española  exhibits one alien allele  at  <dig> of the  <dig> loci investigated . it is therefore impossible that both parents of this individual are among the  <dig> breeders. sequencing of a section of the control region in individual e <dig> reveals the single haplotype identified previously  <cit>  as specific to the española population. these results suggest that e <dig> is a hybrid between a female española tortoise and a male from another island. to assess the geographic origin of the father, we genotyped e <dig> at  <dig> loci  that had been previously used for analysing genetic variability and population structure of giant tortoises across the whole archipelago  <cit> . the "alien" alleles revealed for e <dig> are found at varying frequencies in populations throughout isabela, santiago, pinzón, santa cruz, and san cristóbal. using a genotypic database of  <dig> field-sampled individuals from all populations on the major islands, we performed assignment tests using rannala and mountain's approach  <cit>   and pritchard et al.'s method  <cit>  . the first method assigned e <dig> with high probabilities to the española and pinzón island populations with log likelihood values  of - <dig>  and - <dig> , respectively. all other individuals sampled on española exhibit much higher logl values , assigning them to española. the second approach also indicates that e <dig> exhibits a mixed history, with large contributions from both española and pinzón .

the "alien alleles"  are underlined. between parentheses after each breeder name is the number of loci that are incompatible with parentage of e <dig>  the three males in the pool of  <dig> breeders are indicated with an asterisk.

the most likely explanation is that e <dig> is a hybrid between an española female and a pinzón male. inspection of the genotype of e <dig>  indicates that none of the  <dig> captive females can be its mother , hence, the hybridization event must have taken place on española . the cause for the  presence of a pinzón male on española is unknown but is most likely linked to human transport. one possibility is the pinzón male was a transplant due to the extensive exploitation and sometimes translocation of tortoises by 17–19th century whaling and other activities. it is conceivable that such an animal was missed in the attempts to find all remaining tortoises on española in  <dig>  such transplants have been detected on other islands . this would imply pinzón genetic contamination should have been occurring for several generations, a possibility for which there is no evidence. indeed, the fact that only a single such hybrid offspring has been found in a sample of 400+ survivors on española  is strong evidence against long-term contamination. a more likely scenario is that early in the española releases , a pinzón male was accidentally incorporated into the repatriates. a captive breeding program of pinzón tortoises at the captive breeding centre predates the española program, so pinzón juvenile tortoises were present there at the time of release. furthermore, it is noteworthy that morphologies of pinzón and española tortoises, especially as juveniles, are largely indistinguishable.

CONCLUSIONS
clearly, if one wishes to maintain the guideline/principle of restoring "natural" populations  <cit> , it is important to remove from española the individuals that compromise the integrity of the española gene pool. in addition to e <dig>  we also need to search for the possible presence of its father and  siblings. note that we cannot rule out the possibility that the contaminating pinzón individual may be a grand-parent of e <dig>  however, given that our estimate based on size is that e <dig> is minimum  <dig> years old, and tortoises reach sexual maturity at about  <dig> years of age, it is impossible that e <dig> is a grandchild of a male released within the last  <dig> years. finding e <dig> should be relatively easy because we marked it with a permanent passive integrated transponder tag, as is the case for all individuals that we sampled on the island. finding the father and its descendants will be more difficult, because they do not carry any tag, as their blood has never been sampled. we will therefore need to search for unmarked tortoises, sample them, and use a diagnostic field-based test that will allow us to differentiate pinzón vsespañola alleles. note that, prior to  <dig>  all repatriated animals were marked at cdrs using shell notching. unfortunately, this method is problematic for animals that have grown from about ca.  <dig> cm to 60– <dig> cm plastron length in a highly abrasive environment. hence, we endorse the continued, systematic use of passive integrated transponder tags for marking individuals upon release.

regardless of the means by which pinzon alleles have entered the española lineage, our analysis  indicates that the rate of contamination of the española breeding-repatriation program is very low, and  underlines the utility of the approach used by the gnp and the cdrs, i.e., use molecular genetic approaches to monitor the breeding-repatriation program. one future step might be to routinely perform a diagnostic pcr-based test on all the tortoises that will be released in the future to assess their correspondence with the target population. despite this detected single contamination, it is highly noteworthy to emphasize the success of this repatriation program conducted by the png and cdrs over nearly  <dig> years in difficult conditions and involving release of over  <dig> captive-bred tortoises that now reproduce in situ. the recent incorporation of molecular genetic analysis of the program is providing further insights and guidance that will aid in assuring the survival of this unique linage of a spectacular animal.
