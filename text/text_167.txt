BACKGROUND
physical maps are important tools for genomic studies both in animal and plant species. among other, they facilitate positional gene cloning in crop plant species  <cit> . thus, cloning of at least thirteen genes is currently underway in hexaploid wheat , making use of physical contig map  <cit> . apart from positional gene cloning, physical maps have been used in genome sequencing projects  <cit> . although a majority of higher plant genomes have been sequenced by whole genome shotgun strategy  <cit> , hierarchical approach of genome sequencing with the intermediate in form of physical contig map anchored to individual chromosomes is a prerequisite to obtain high-quality reference sequences  <cit> . physical contig maps are typically constructed from bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries that are created from genomic dna digested by restriction enzymes and cloned in a bac vector  <cit> . after bac library construction, high-information content fingerprinting  technology  <cit>  detects clone overlaps on the basis of sharing restriction spectrum  <cit>  and fingerprinted data are statistically elaborated by finger printed contigs   <cit>  or linear topological contig   <cit>  software. a physical map consists from bac clones organized into contigs  whose number depends on genome coverage and insert size of bac clones.

the utility of physical maps for positional gene cloning and genomic studies is limited until the contigs of bac clones are ordered along chromosomes, usually with the help of high density genetic maps. an indispensable step in integrating physical and genetic maps is the screening of bac library, which assigns molecular markers to individual bac clones. the screening has been done either by pcr with marker-specific primers  <cit> , or by hybridization of markers to bac dna spotted on a filter  <cit> . historically, bac library screening was the most laborious and expensive step in constructing anchored physical map. the procedure has been gradually improved to achieve more effective anchoring of a majority of contigs. a bac library could be screened using multidimensional pooling strategy  <cit> . a bac pool is prepared by combining predefined set of bac clones within or between 384-well plates in which the clones are stored  <cit> . three-dimensional pooling strategy   <cit>  has been the most popular approach, which could be further improved by adding superpools to minimize the number of pcr reactions needed to link a marker with a bac clone  <cit> . to simplify and speed up the anchoring process, it is also possible to use methods like multiplex tandem pcr with high resolution melt analysis  <cit> , microarray platforms  <cit> , or illumina goldengate assay  <cit> . all these techniques avoid gel electrophoresis, which is most laborious part of pcr screening and cannot be done in a high-throughput manner.

another critical aspect in contig anchoring is the availability of a high-density genetic map with a sufficient number of molecular markers covering evenly the whole genome. such maps are becoming available for a growing number of species  <cit>  thanks to progress in methodology and instrumentation of molecular biology and genomics, which resulted in negligible cost per data point. however, general problem of genetic maps is a poor resolution in centromeric and pericentromeric regions due to the lack of recombination. in fact, poorly recombining regions may represent 40% of chromosome as show in barley  <cit> . alternative approaches have been developed to organize molecular markers along the chromosome independently on meiotic recombination, and included deletion bin mapping  <cit> , happy mapping  <cit>  and radiation-hybrid mapping  <cit> . a recent addition is the approach called “genomezipper”  <cit> . genomezipper is a bioinformatic pipeline constructing a virtual gene order in a particular genome through comparative analysis using synteny conservation with species already sequenced. for crops belonging to tribe triticeae, brachypodium  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and sorghum  <cit>  are typically used to order genes along chromosomes  <cit> .

the crops in tribe triticeae are characterized by large and complex genomes. bread wheat , one of the three major crops worldwide has hexaploid  genome of  <dig> gbp, which comprises three closely related sub-genomes and contains more than 90% repetitive dna. special approach called “chromosome based genomics” has been developed to handle physical mapping and sequencing of the wheat genome  <cit> . bac libraries have been constructed from dna of flow sorted chromosomes and chromosome arms  <cit> . the availability of bac libraries from individual chromosomes greatly simplifies the construction of ready to sequence physical maps and the analysis of the complex allohexaploid wheat genome.

here we present novel approach for bac library screening and contig anchoring based on illumina sequencing of three-dimensional bac pools prepared from minimum tilling path . genetic markers as well as any other sequences can be mapped easily to bac clones in a single in silico experiment. we used wheat chromosome arm 3ds to demonstrate the utility of our novel approach by anchoring about  <dig> sequences of intra- and inter-specific origin to the physical contig map.

RESULTS
ordered physical contig maps are valuable resources for genome analysis, production of reference sequences of complex genomes, and positional gene cloning. however, efficient use of physical maps requires that clone contigs are anchored to chromosomes and ordered along them using molecular markers. the aim of the present work was to develop in silico procedure for bac contig anchoring. the approach we have validated makes screening of bac library cost effective and more flexible. the procedure includes mas parallel sequencing three dimensional bac pools, mapping sequence reads to marker sequences, positive pool identification and bac address deconvolution .figure  <dig> graphical overview of the procedure for in silicophysical map anchoring.



bac-pool sequencing
the original target for the sequencing was at least 10x coverage for each of bac pools. finally, about  <dig> million reads were generated in three illumina hiseq <dig> lines. mean coverage of bac pools reached nearly 35x. however, the coverage ranged from  <dig>  for pool p <dig> to  <dig>  for pool rp . so large differences in coverage of bac pools were not expected. to investigate the effect of sequencing depth, we selected and mapped reads representing different depth of pool rp from 1x to 50x to genomezipper sequence dataset and counted the sequences identified in the pool. this parameter reached a plateau at 30x coverage .figure  <dig> coverage test for read alignment. reads representing different sequencing depth of bac pool rp from 1x to 50x were randomly selected from sequencing data and aligned to  <dig> sequences represented in genomezipper dataset. sequences covered with aligned reads at least from 80% of the length were considered positive . the curve reached plateau at about 30x coverage. the noise of the growth curve is due to random selection of reads for alignment.



read alignment optimization
reads of bac pool rp were aligned using mosaik to genomezipper sequence dataset with the aim to optimize alignment parameters. the bac pool was considered positive for a particular sequence if “covered region”  was at least 80% of the sequence length. hash size  was optimized first without any limitation of alignment candidate threshold. time needed for read mapping, decreased dramatically for hash size between ten and fifteen . further decrease of computation time is shown in figure 3a. the sensitivity of alignment was not influenced by hash size, and the number of sequences found in the pool rp remained  <dig> for any hash size used . considering these results, hash size  <dig> was selected for further analysis.figure  <dig> hash size test for read alignment. hash size was tested with respect to alignment sensitivity and time needed for analysis. a) time needed to align 30x coverage of pool rp to  <dig> sequences in genomezipper dataset. b) the number of sequences positive for pool rp. sequences covered with aligned reads at least from 80% of the length were considered as positive . while hash size has no effect on alignment sensitivity, increasing hash size reduced time needed to align reads.



alignment candidate threshold  was optimized with hash size  <dig>  when the alignment candidate threshold is set, only alignments reaching at least the set length are considered. we tested this parameter for values between  <dig> and  <dig>  in parallel to hash size, time needed for the analysis decreased with the increased alignment candidate threshold. however, the effect was negligible when compared to that for hash size . the number of positive sequences found in the pool ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  and decreased with alignment candidate threshold getting close to 100 bp . however, the sensitivity of sequence alignment remained stable for alignment candidate thresholds up to half of the read length in our case . alignment candidate threshold  <dig> was selected for further analysis as there was no reduction in the analysis time if it was further increased, and this value was low enough to keep the expected alignment sensitivity.figure  <dig> alignment candidate threshold test for read alignment. alignment candidate threshold was tested with respect to alignment sensitivity and analysis time. a) time needed to align 30x coverage of pool rp to  <dig> sequences represented in genomezipper dataset. b) the number of sequences positive for pool rp. sequences covered with aligned reads at least from 80% of the length were considered as positive . while alignment candidate threshold has negligible effect on alignment sensitivity, increasing hash size reduced number of positive sequences as it is getting closer to read length .



the pool rp should be positive for  <dig> % of sequences  as it was one of sixteen row pools. thanks to overlaps of bac clones in the mtp, each row pool represents more than  <dig> % of entire physical map. on the other hand, one cannot expect that physical map represents the complete chromosome arm as it may carry regions lacking restriction site for the enzyme used to construct the bac library. overall, the  <dig> positive sequences out of  <dig> for pool rp agreed well with our expectation.

read alignment
the criteria optimal for row pool rp  were used for all other pools: hash size 20; alignment candidate threshold  <dig>  the number of positive sequences per bac pool  was counted after the final read alignment. alignment of reads of individual bac pools to  <dig> genomezipper sequences resulted in  <dig> to  <dig> positive sequences per pool. on average,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequences were aligned to plate, row and column pools, respectively . the smallest number of positive sequences was found in plate pool p <dig>  which was significantly under-sequenced . a distribution of sequences in pooling dimension  showed reduced detection of sequence markers in plate pools. on average, only  <dig>  sequences per  <dig> bac clones were detected in plate pools,  <dig>  sequences per  <dig> clones in row pools and  <dig>  sequences per  <dig> clones in column pools. this phenomenon could reflect larger growth differences among  <dig> clones in plate pools as compared to  <dig> and  <dig> clones in row and column pools, respectively. under-representation of a particular clone  in the pool could then lead to false negative result for the pool after read alignment.

twenty nine to ninety five positive sequences per bac pool  were identified in ae. tauschii sequence dataset . mean values were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  positive sequences per plate, row and column pool, respectively. as for the genomezipper dataset, plate pool p <dig> had the smallest number of positive sequences, and plate pools showed the lowest number of detected sequences. on average,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequences were detected in  <dig> bac clones in plate, row and column pools, respectively. pools with sequencing depth lower than twenty were more likely to have lower number of positive sequences . these observations suggest that minimal coverage for each pool should be  <dig>  otherwise, increased frequency of false negative results for under-sequenced pools  can lead to reduced number of anchored sequences.

positive pool detection
alignment of reads from individual bac pools to genomezipper sequence dataset resulted in a variable number of positive pools per individual sequence .  <dig>  genomezipper sequences were found in at least one pool and the remaining  <dig> sequences were not scored in any of the fifty pools. to explain this, we screened the pools with primers specific for ten of the sequences using pcr. out of ten markers, eight identified at least one positive pool after pcr screening the pools , which were prepared in the same way as for sequencing. this indicates high level of false negative results. as mentioned above, sequencing depth could influence the identification of pools containing target sequences. thus, the pools with lower sequence depth could be more frequently false scored as negative. further, individual clones in pools could be under-represented in the sequence reads, and hence not covering particular sequence by reads enough to reach the threshold. finally, duplicated regions among sequences with 100% identity could not be covered by any read as only reads mapping to unique positions were used for the analysis.figure  <dig> positive pool detection. each individual pool was considered positive, if its reads covered at least 80% of particular sequence. a) distribution of the number of sequences positive for given number of pools for genomezipper and ae. tauschii sequence dataset. only sequences with at least one positive pool were considered. b) distribution of sequences with at least one positive pool among seven ae. tauschii chromosomes. note that a majority of sequences originate from chromosome 3d.



similarly to genomezipper dataset, alignment of reads from bac pools to ae. tauschii sequence dataset resulted in a variable number of positive pools per sequence . excessive number of pools was positive for several sequences, and for three sequences even all fifty pools were positive . this fact led to the modification of bac address deconvolution script and all markers with more than five positive pools in any of the dimensions  were considered repetitive and were not assigned to any of the bac clones detected by the script. out of the  <dig>  ae. tauschii sequences,  <dig>  were detected in at least one bac pool. while genomezipper was constructed specifically for 3ds chromosome arm, ae. tauschii sequences originate from all seven chromosomes. this led to lower fraction of sequences detected in pools as compared to the genomezipper dataset. on the other hand, it allowed us to screen pools for sequences originating from other genome regions and thus estimate the rate of false positive results. for non-target chromosomes  the frequency of sequences scored in at least one pool ranged from  <dig> % for chromosome 7d to  <dig> % for chromosome 6d . these results indicate low level of false positive results, which we estimated below 3%.  <dig> % sequences genetically mapped to ae. tauschii chromosome 3d were detected in pools. the ratio of molecular sizes of the short and long arm of 3d chromosome can be used to estimate the number of markers on the short and long arm. using the ratio 321: <dig> mbp  <cit> ,  <dig> ae. tauschii sequences with up most positions on genetic map should correspond to 3ds chromosome arm. among them,  <dig>  were indeed found in at least one pool. out of the markers mapped to the long arm of ae. tauschii chromosome 3d, only  <dig>  were positive in bac pools from wheat 3ds.

bac address deconvolution
each bac clone is present in a single plate, row and column pool . thus, it should be possible to deconvolute positive pools to individual clones using the information about the presence of individual clones in pooled samples. in other words, each combination of single plate, row and column pools could be unambiguously deconvoluted to a single bac clone. thus, it was possible to link sequences with one positive pool in each dimension to a particular bac clone . this type of sequences represented  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all sequences scored in at least one pool using genomezipper and ae. tauschii datasets, respectively . for sequences with more than one positive pool in any of the dimensions, positive clones were selected from all possible candidates. for example, in case of two positive plate pools, two positive row pools and two positive column pools, there are eight  candidate clones. as all positive clones contain the same unique sequence, they should overlap, at least partially. we used the information from the physical map to verify this. first, if two or more clones among the candidate clones were in the same contig in the physical map, they were selected as positive clones . second, information about putative clone overlap at relaxed cutoff  was utilized. two or more clones were selected as positive out of the candidates if they were placed at the ends of bac contigs  and they matched each other at cutoff 1e- <dig> . these two approaches resulted in anchoring  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequences from genomezipper dataset. using the same strategy for ae. tauschii dataset,  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequences were anchored to physical map contigs. altogether,  <dig>  sequences from genomezipper and  <dig> ae. tauschii datasets were linked with physical map contigs. within the ae. tauschii dataset,  <dig> sequences were assumed to originate from chromosome arm 3ds representing  <dig> % of sequences mapped genetically to chromosome arm 3ds. after the deconvolution, some sequences remained not anchored as no positive bac clone was identified for them even if they were positive for at least one pool. majority of them were represented by sequences with a missing positive pool in at least one of the dimensions  and sequences for which no overlap/match of any two candidate clones was identified in physical map . for those sequences, false negative results for some pools prevented identification of positive bac clones.figure  <dig> anchoring results for sequences with at least one positive pool. for both sequence datasets , about half of sequences were anchored to bac clones/physical map contigs. a particular bac pool was considered positive if its reads covered at least 80% of particular sequence after read alignment to complete sequence set. a majority of the remaining sequences were not anchored either due to missing positive pool in one of the dimensions  or no candidate clone overlap during the deconvolution .



analysis with decreasing stringency of positive pool detection
based on the results of the initial analysis , we performed the analysis with successively lower value for covered region . we decreased the covered region from 80% to 30% of sequence length in steps of 10% . with the genomezipper dataset, the threshold 30% of covered region resulted in at least one positive pool for  <dig>  sequences. the increased number of sequences found in pools confirmed false negative results obtained after the initial stringent analysis, which was indicated by pcr screening .  <dig> sequences from genomezipper dataset could be anchored to bac clones based on less stringent criteria . this represented more than twofold increase in the number of anchored sequences as compared to more stringent conditions . similarly, 60% increase of anchored sequences  was achieved when the same conditions of anchoring were applied to ae. tauschii sequences mapped to chromosome arm 3ds . after the analysis at several successive lower covered regions, we compared anchoring results between the most and least stringent analysis. among  <dig> genomezipper sequences anchored at covered region 80%,  <dig> were anchored to the same contig with covered region 30%. this indicates the robustness of the pipeline. in case of six sequences, identification of additional positive pools under less stringent conditions resulted in identification of different clones/contigs after bac address deconvolution. for the remaining eleven markers, additional positive pools prevented unambiguous identification of positive bac clones. we used pcr to confirm the presence of particular sequence in clones detected using either high or low stringency conditions. in four cases , bac clones identified under low stringency conditions  were positive after pcr with specific primers. in one case , clones under both high and low stringency conditions of analysis were found positive after pcr screening. for the last sequence  no clone identified after bac address deconvolution in in silico analysis was positive . all these results indicate a tendency for false negative pool detection rather than for false positive pool detection.

anchoring quality control
after the analysis with a decreasing stringency, we used pcr to verify the results of in silico analysis. we randomly selected fifteen representatives of anchored sequences  and used specific primers to confirm the presence of sequences in particular clone. in all fifteen cases, pcr confirmed the presence of particular sequences in clones detected in silico . to further confirm the anchoring results, we investigated all physical map contigs with two and more sequences anchored and assessed the distance of anchored sequences based on their order in the virtual map . out of the  <dig> bac contigs with multiple genomezipper sequences, a majority  contained neighbouring genes in genomezipper. in eight contigs, genes more distant in genomezipper were found . some of these genes could be anchored to incorrect contigs. however, there are at least four explanations: 1) chimeric bac clones; 2) missassembly of physical map contigs; 3) incorrect order of genes in genomezipper; and 4) false anchoring of sequences to particular contigs. similarly, we checked the genetic distance of ae. tauschii sequences anchored to one physical map contig. we found  <dig> contigs with more than one sequence genetically mapped to chromosome 3d of ae. tauschii. in  <dig> cases , genetic distance of particular snps was lower than 1 cm.

utility of bac pools sequencing for physical map anchoring
we were able to anchor  <dig> sequences from ae. tauschii dataset genetically mapped to chromosome arm 3ds using combination of high and low stringency anchoring conditions . under the same conditions,  <dig> sequences represented in 3ds genomezipper dataset were assigned to physical map contigs. this represent  <dig> % of  <dig> non-redundant gene fragments  organized in wheat 3ds genomezipper . recently, poursarebani et al.  <cit>  used similar approach for physical map anchoring. authors used short sequence tags produced from whole genome profiling   <cit>  to anchor sequences to physical map of wheat chromosome 6a. they were able to anchor 67% genes used for anchoring. in comparison, we successfully anchored 79% gene fragments. while reads produced after bac pools sequencing are distributed evenly along the whole bac insert, sequence tags are produced from specific sites surrounding recognition pattern of restriction enzyme used for wgp. consequently, missing restriction site in the region of a gene could make anchoring of that particular gene impossible. poursarebani et al.  <cit>  used for physical map building bac clones with 6– <dig> sequence tags. it is likely, that clones with low number of sequence tags could more frequently miss a tag in the regions of genes they contain. clear advantage of the method used by poursarebani et al.  <cit>  over our approach is the absence of additional cost after the physical map building. however, bac clone fingerprinting using whole genome profiling is not the only possibility for physical map construction and may not be always the best possibility. as an alternative, hifc technique  <cit>  for bac fingerprinting could be used and was used many times. no sequence tags are produced by hifc technique and physical map cannot be anchored by approach used by poursarebani et al.  <cit> .

hybridization of pooled bac-dna with wheat 40 k unigene array  <cit>  was recently used to anchor genes to several wheat physical maps of wheat chromosome arms  <cit> . for the wheat chromosome 1a,  <dig> and  <dig>  genes were placed on the physical map of short and long arm, respectively  <cit> . genes syntenic with brachypodium distachyon represent about one third of those genes . here we anchored a comparable number of syntenic genes with b. distachyon . compared to physical map of chromosome arm 1al, we reached higher efficiency of gene positioning. while lucas at al.  <cit>  were able to anchor  <dig>  out of  <dig>  syntenic genes or gene fragments, we were able to found bac address for 79% of syntenic genes. the advantage of our approach is a possibility to change stringency of anchoring conditions. in case of array hybridization, this means re-hybridization of bac-dna with the array under changed conditions, which increases the cost of experiment. once bac pool sequencing is done, there are no additional expenses for in silico anchoring using different parameters. philippe et al.  <cit>  used array hybridization to anchor isbp  markers. they succeed in anchoring of  <dig>  isbp markers to physical map of wheat chromosome arm 1bl. however, the experiment again required hybridization of all pooled bac-dna samples with an array. as the isbp markers are a popular type of marker, we tested the utility of in silico anchoring also for this type of markers and found that many repetitive sequences, which are not present in high copy number in wheat genome could be assigned to individual bac clones . in the present study we tested in silico anchoring with a relatively small number of sequences. nevertheless,  <dig> contigs were anchored to 3ds chromosome arm by at least one marker, and these contigs represent  <dig> % physical map length . we expect that a majority of contigs could be anchored in a single experiment as additional sequence resources have recently become available for hexaploid wheat  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the first step after bac contig building is anchoring the contigs to genetic map as it increases the utility for physical map based cloning and genomic studies. here we present novel approach for contig anchoring based on mass parallel sequencing 3-dimmensional bac pools prepared from mtp of physical map. we demonstrate that genetic markers as well as other sequences can be easily mapped to bac clones in a single in silico experiment. we used physical contig map of wheat chromosome arm 3ds in a pilot experiment to validate the utility of this approach by anchoring  <dig> sequences of intra- and inter-specific origin. the approach described in present study could significantly reduce anchoring costs and time needed and is applicable to any genomic project aiming at constructing anchored physical map. the only prerequisite is the availability of sequenced markers ordered along the chromosome. however, such markers can be easily obtained by mass parallel sequencing and linearly ordered through the comparative analysis and synteny conservation with the sequenced model species  <cit> .
