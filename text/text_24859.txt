BACKGROUND
the prevalence of diabetes in the world has been estimated at  <dig> % in  <dig>  and is projected to increase to  <dig> % by  <dig>  <cit> . the disease currently affects approximately  <dig> % of the us population, and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. diabetes is a major cause of stroke, blindness, heart disease, and end-stage renal disease   <cit> . among these sequelae, diabetic nephropathy  is one of the most common complications of both type  <dig> and type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> .

the pathophysiology of dn is complex and multiple mechanisms contribute to its development and outcome. early hemodynamic changes and defective autoregulation of glomerular filtration rate lead to glomerular hyperfiltration and hyperperfusion  <cit> . mechanisms involving glycosylation of tissue proteins  <cit> , activation of protein kinase c  <cit> , and the aldose reductase pathway  <cit>  are believed to promote tissue damage, glomerular basement membrane thickening, glomerular hypertrophy and mesangial expansion. other factors linked to the development and progression of dn include the expression of nephrin  <cit> , inflammatory cytokines, vascular endothelial growth factor   <cit> , lipid mediators  <cit> , and reactive oxygen species  <cit> . although, there is evidence that genetic predisposition influences the incidence and severity of dn, the low likelihood of identifying a single gene for the pathogenesis of dn has shifted research towards a multigene approach to understand mechanisms and etiology of the disease  <cit> .

current management of dn centers on preventing the development of risk factors such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia, early diagnosis, and antihypertensive therapy to reduce rate of decline in renal function  <cit> . despite advancements in therapy, dn continues to be the most common cause of esrd and requires dialysis in the u.s.  <cit> . the human and economic costs associated with esrd raise the importance of risk factor reduction and the need to identify novel therapeutic targets to manage diabetes-induced kidney damage.

a large number of studies have now documented the protective role of pigment epithelium-derived factor  against a wide range of oxidative and excitotoxic insults . the neuroprotective, anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties of pedf have been exploited in many preclinical therapeutic strategies  <cit>  especially since the gene is expressed in several tissues  <cit>  including the kidney where the highest expression is in the glomeruli  <cit> . in diabetes, serum levels of pedf increase whereas tissue levels in the eye and kidney decrease in diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy respectively . such studies imply that restoring pedf levels could reduce damage to tissues in diabetes. for example, increasing pedf levels in the kidney by injecting an adenovirus expressing the protein significantly alleviates microalbuminuria in the early stages of diabetes  <cit> .

because pedf is a large 50kd protein it has limited usefulness as a therapeutic agent in many cases. however, an active  <dig> amino acid fragment of pedf  can block ischemic damage to retinal ganglion cells and reduce neuronal death, vascular abnormalities and inflammatory changes in a mouse model of diabetic retinopathy  <cit> . we have shown that continuous infusion of this peptide in diabetic mice protects against development of diabetic nephropathy as indicated by reduced albuminuria, blood urea nitrogen, macrophage recruitment and expression of inflammatory cytokines and fibrotic markers, balanced nephrin expression, and decreased histological changes in diabetic kidneys  <cit> . in a proof of concept extension of those studies we confirmed that continuous systemic infusion of p <dig> blocks the progression of well-established diabetic nephropathy in the ins2
akita mouse model of dn  <cit> . here we used kidney samples obtained from the recently published proof of concept experiments  <cit>  to study transcriptome changes in these non-treated and p78-treated diabetic nephropathy mice to identify novel gene candidates and pathways as regulators in the pathogenesis of dn.

methods
p <dig> drug delivery in diabetic ins2akita mice
kidney tissue samples were obtained from a recently published study that tested physiological effects of p <dig> on kidney function and pathology  <cit> . animals were treated as previously described  <cit>  prior to extracting rna for rna-seq analysis. the animal studies were approved by the penn state university college of medicine institutional animal care and use committee, and performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals of the national institutes of health. all experiments were conducted using male d <dig> b6-ins2
akita/matbj diabetic animals and their wild type  littermate mice , recommended by the animal models of diabetes complications consortium  as a model of dn  <cit> . the diabetic d <dig> b6-ins2
akita mice develop hyperglycemia at 3 weeks of age and all treatment carried out when the mice were either 6 weeks  or 12 weeks  of age. only mice with blood glucose levels > 350 mg/dl  were considered diabetic and used in the study.

the drug tested was p <dig>  a small pedf active peptide  <cit> , generated by methods previously described  <cit> . briefly, p <dig> peptide at a dose of  <dig>  μg/g/day or vehicle  was administered by continuous subcutaneous infusion via the osmotic minipump , implanted dorsally between the shoulders of the animals as previously described . transcriptome analysis of wild-type and diabetic kidney samples were performed at two stages of diabetes where treatment was initiated at an early stage  and late stage . age, gender, and weight matched diabetic ins2akita and wild-type non-diabetic controls were used in the study. all animals including wild-type were implanted with an osmotic minipump infused with either vehicle  or the p <dig> peptide . duration of treatment was 6 weeks with either peptide or vehicle. one group received treatment at the early stage of diabetes  at 6 weeks of age and the experiment terminated at 12 weeks of age. treatment in the second group was initiated at late stage diabetes  at 12 weeks of age and terminated at 18 weeks of age. mice were provided ad lib access to food and water and were euthanized at the end of the experimental period. kidney samples for rna extraction were immediately harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen at the termination of the experiment.

tissue samples preparation and rna isolation
for rnaseq we used  <dig> kidney tissue samples from wild-type mice,  <dig> from the diabetic ins2
akita mice,  <dig> from early p <dig> treatment of diabetic ins2
akita mice, and  <dig> from late p <dig> treatment the diabetic ins2
akita mice  <cit> . total rna was extracted using mirvana kit  with some modifications. briefly, a bead mill homogenizer  was used to homogenize the tissue using a safe-lock microcentrifuge tube  and a mass of stainless steel beads  equal to the mass of the tissue. immediately after two volumes of lysis buffer were added to the tube, samples were mixed in the bullet blender for 1 min at a speed of six. samples were visually inspected to confirm desired homogenization and then incubated at 37 °c for 5 min. the lysis buffer was added up to  <dig>  ml, and samples were mixed in the bullet blender for 1 min. optical density values of extracted rna were measured using nanodrop  to confirm an a260:a <dig> ratio above  <dig> . rna integration number  was measured using bioanalyzer  rna  <dig> nano kit to confirm rin above  <dig> 

library preparation and sequencing
the cdna libraries were prepared using sureselect strand specific rna library preparation kit  as per the manufacturer’s instructions. briefly, polya rna was purified from 1000 ng of total rna using oligo  beads. extracted rna was subjected to fragmentation, reverse transcription, end repair, 3’-end adenylation, adaptor ligation and subsequent pcr amplification and spri bead purification . the unique barcode sequences were incorporated in the adaptors for multiplexed high-throughput sequencing. the final product was assessed for its size distribution and concentration using bioanalyzer high sensitivity dna kit  and kapa library quantification kit .  <dig> libraries were pooled and diluted to  <dig> nm in eb buffer  and then denatured using the illumina protocol. the denatured libraries were diluted to  <dig> pm by pre-chilled hybridization buffer and loaded onto truseq sr v <dig> flow cells on an illumina hiseq  <dig> and run for 50 cycles using a single-read recipe  according to the manufacturer's instructions .

quality control, mapping and quantification of rna-seq reads
illumina casava pipeline version  <dig>  was used to extract de-multiplexed sequencing reads. fastqc   was used to validate the quality of the raw sequence data. additional quality filtering used fastx-toolkit  using a quality score cutoff of  <dig>  next, alignment of the filtered reads to the mouse reference genome  was done using tophat   <cit>  allowing  <dig> mismatches. picard   was used to assess proportion of mapped bases to coding, utr, intronic, and intergenic regions, respectively. picard was used to find coverage across gene body to determine 5’- or 3’- bias. fpkm  values were calculated using cufflinks version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  as provided with the ensembl gene annotation .

differential gene expression  analysis
only reliably expressed genes were included in the analysis, defined to be those with at least  <dig> samples with fpkm > =  <dig>  the combat function of the sva v <dig> . <dig> r package was used for batch normalization of the fpkm values. the degexp function of the degseq v <dig> . <dig> r package  <cit>  was used to identify differentially expressed genes  between diabetes and control , treatment and diabetes , early treatment and diabetes  and late treatment and diabetes , using the likelihood ratio test method. significantly deg were defined to be those with q-value <  <dig>  calculated by the storey et al.  <dig> method.

RESULTS
global transcriptome changes
results obtained from degseq analysis applied on rna-seq fpkm  showed significant differences in coding and non-coding genes expressed in the kidney among control , diabetic , early , and late  p <dig> treatment in the ins2akita mouse model of diabetic nephropathy . below we provide results for protein coding and non-coding genes that were regulated in the diabetic kidney relative to p <dig> treated and wt controls: the comparisons are  diabetic relative to wild type ,  p <dig> treated relative to non-treated diabetic ,  diabetic returned to normal levels by treatment , and  p <dig> early stage treatment  compared to late stage treatment . early  and late  p <dig> treatments are grouped in the tvd analyses to determine all gene targets of the treatment whether given at early or late stages of diabetes. these are later separated in the study to determine those targets that were unique to et and those unique to lt.

p <dig> treatment normalized gene expression altered by diabetes
from this analysis , we identified a small set of genes where the changes in diabetes were substantially  or completely reversed by p <dig> treatment. these are listed in table 3c and rank-ordered by fc > = <dig>  . of these, non-homologous end-joining factor  <dig>  had the highest absolute fold change in expression with both diabetes and treatment. diabetes induced expression levels of nhej <dig> by + <dig>  while p <dig> complete reversed expression by - <dig>  fold changes. treatment also completely reversed diabetes-induced expression changes of mamdc <dig>  kdm4b, tmem <dig>  selm, and hpd while others were returned in the direction of normal levels from their diabetes-induced state by ~50% .

this small subset of genes regulated in opposite directions by both diabetes and p <dig>  a treatment previously shown to reduce dn pathology  <cit>  may be critically involved in diabetes-induced mechanisms that control the development of the disease.

transcripts regulated by early and late stage p <dig> treatment
since treatments were given at early and late stage diabetes, we sorted the data to identify genes that were regulated by early treatment and those regulated by late treatment . several transcripts were unique targets of p <dig> in early and in late stages of diabetes but many were common targets of p <dig> regardless of the stage of diabetes  in which case treatment completely reversed diabetes-induced regulation. nhej <dig>  for example showed regulation from fc = + <dig>  in the diabetic kidney  to - <dig>  and - <dig> , for early and late treatments, respectively . nhej <dig>  a dna repair gene, showed the highest fold changes of the protein coding genes regulated by p <dig> treatments  in both stages of diabetes. we identified sixteen protein-coding genes that were targets of p <dig> that were significant and reliably altered in expression levels regardless of the diabetic stage when treatment was given . these represented ~50% similarity in gene expression changes by treatment at both early and late stages of diabetes. with the exception of c <dig>  which showed increased expression  with early treatment and change in expression in the opposite direction  with late treatment, the other  <dig> genes were regulated in the same direction by p <dig> and with similar fc in both diabetic stages treated . many differences in genes showing expression changes were also observed between the early and late stage diabetes treatments. for example in early diabetes treatment increased levels of ugt1a <dig> , s100a <dig> , plk <dig> , and lcn <dig>  and decreased levels of cyp24a <dig>  and tfpi <dig> , genes whose expression changes were not evident with late treatment using our cut off criteria. others that showed changes in gene expression with late stage diabetes treatment including alox5ap , etf <dig> , psmd <dig> , and adck <dig>  did not show changes with early stage treatment.table  <dig> protein coding genes differentially expressed with the highest positive or negative fc in kidney samples of the ins2

the tables show only those genes that were significant and reliably expressed with fc > = <dig>  , fc > = <dig>    and those that were regulated by both treatments .these were rank-ordered by highest numerical +/- fc values. a. p <dig> treatment administered at early  or late  stage diabetes relative to diabetic controls.  <dig> genes were regulated by treatment with p <dig> at the early stage of diabetes and  <dig> by treatment at the late stage of diabetes. b. the table shows all protein-coding genes that were regulated by p <dig> in the same direction  at both stages of diabetes which represented ~50% of the genes




non-coding small rnas 
diabetes and p <dig> also regulated a group of small non-coding rna precursor biotypes, with yet unknown or speculative function but are generally believed to control expression and biological function of coding genes. twenty nine of these with the greatest expression changes  <dig>   were identified in the diseased kidney compared to wild-type controls  and include mirna, snrna, snorna, and pseudogene biotypes. mirnas highly regulated in dn with fc > = <dig>  include mir <dig> , mir142b , mir <dig> , mir196a- <dig> , mir27a  . from this analysis, we also identified a set of small rnas, categorized as mirna by gencode, that was highly regulated by diabetes  and whose expression levels were completely or partially reversed by p <dig> treatment . these are rank ordered by fc  in table 5b. of interest in the development and treatment of dn are those mirna regulated by diabetes whose expression levels were complete reversed by p <dig> treatment including gm <dig>  gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  gm <dig>  mir <dig>  gm <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  others including mir <dig>  and mir142b  where expression changes in diabetes were not significantly returned to normal levels by treatment. while the functions of many of these sequences are still being elucidated, they represent a class of rnas that may be useful in understanding the dn pathobiology and in developing treatments for the disease.table  <dig> differentially expressed precursor mirnas including gms assigned as mirna by gencode with highest fc in kidney samples of the ins2

biological function - pathways ingenuity pathway analysis 
ipa analysis shows that protein-coding genes regulated by diabetes and returned to near normal levels by treatment  are associated with key biological functions including lipid metabolism, post translational modification, endocrine and hematological functions, cell death and survival, and protein synthesis, all important processes associated with the disease . many of these are also associated with other pathologies including organismal injury and abnormalities, cancer, developmental and hereditary disorders fig.  <dig>

ipa gene ontology algorithms and knowledgebase mining identified several important canonical pathways enriched for the differentially expressed genes  in our dataset. deg fell into one of several functionally relevant canonical pathways associated with diabetes and kidney pathology. figure  <dig> shows the top pathways represented with fc > = <dig>   and fig.  <dig>  the percentage of genes regulated relative to those present in the ipa knowledgebase that are assigned to a given pathway and the direction of their regulation  for diabetic  and p <dig> treatment  groups . the total number of genes assigned to a pathway in the ipa knowledgebase is given to the right of each bar. the open area of each bar represents genes in the pathway that are not represented in our dataset. pathways were rank-ordered by ipa base on the significance of the directional change  and are limited to those enriched in ipa knowlegebase.fig.  <dig> canonical pathways identified by ingenuity pathway analysis  gene ontology algorithms for all significant and reliable deg in the dataset. a. dvc: diabetic ins2

the graph in fig. 8a shows a striking trend in diabetes-induced degs with mitochondrial dysfunction in the diabetic group relative to wild type controls. the largest functional cluster of genes modulated by diabetes was represented in the mitochodrial dysfunction canonical pathway. approximately 50% of the  <dig> genes assigned to this pathway were differentially expressed by diabetes and ~48% of these were downregulated. the overall trend observed from this analysis was that diabetes decreased expression of more kidney genes clustered in these pathways  when compared to controls. in three of these pathways associated with chronic renal injury, renal failure, and renal inorganic phosphate homeostasis, all genes were downregulated by diabetes that were present in our kidney dataset.

p <dig> targeted some of the same pathways as diabetes but fewer genes showed altered expression levels after treatment relative to controls . for example, ~50% of the genes in the mitochondrial pathway showed changes in expression in the diabetes group relative to controls while only ~5% showed altered expression in the treated diabetes group relative to controls. genes in the p <dig> treated diabetic mice represented in the cytochrome p- <dig> and reversible glomerulonephritis associated pathways were all downregulated compared to those in the same pathway for non-treated mice. while those assigned to the recovery from ischemic acute renal failure pathway showed increased levels of expression after treatment compared to the non-treated diabetic mice. since we previously showed that p <dig> significantly reduced physiological and pathological changes in diabetic nephropathy  <cit>  these target pathways and their associated genes may give mechanistic clues to the disease.

discussion
in this study we identified a set of transcriptome changes in the kidney of the ins2
akita mouse model of diabetic nephropathy  with and without pedf-p <dig> peptide treatment. kidney samples were obtained from our recently published studies in which we showed that continuous infusion of p <dig> reduced albuminuria, blood urea nitrogen, and progression of dn  <cit> . the results from this study provides a panel of biomarkers that shed light into the dn pathology and validate the use of p <dig> as a therapeutic approach for renal injury.

using an rnaseq approach  <cit> , we identified a panel of genes dysregulated in dn. genes showing the greatest decrease in expression in dn include srd5a <dig> , aif <dig> , a protein that modulate insulin secretion in prediabetic rats  <cit> , angptl <dig> , thrsp , and ucp <dig> , found in the mitochondrial membrane of brown adipose tissue  <cit> . in addition, functional annotation using ingenuity pathway analysis and knowledgebase revealed the highest enrichment of dn regulated genes in oxidation-reduction reaction and lipid biosynthesis pathways including the genes srd5a <dig>  scd <dig> , hsd17b <dig> , fasn , degs <dig> -desaturase, sphingolipid 2), alox <dig> , and pecr  . scd <dig>  for example, catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction of monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis  <cit>  and is regulated by leptin, a key regulator of obesity-linked diabetes, through insulin independent mechanisms  <cit>  while fasn deregulation is linked to metabolic diseases and insulin-resistance  <cit> . while clear associations between these genes and dn are not yet elucidated, their involvement in important biochemical pathways of insulin metabolism, oxidative stress, and obesity, suggest they have important influences on renal injury.

we also identified genes whose expression in diabetic animals was affected by p <dig> treatment.  <dig> %  of all rna transcripts showing abnormal expression in dn were reverted back to partial or complete normal levels by treatment. because p <dig> is effective in reducing many of the pathological features of dn  <cit> , we propose that this core set of p <dig> targets may be responsible for the pathology seen in dn and represent key druggable targets.

non-homologous end-joining factor  <dig> , for example, had the highest expression increase in dn  and the highest decrease  by both early and late p <dig> treatments. nhej <dig> encodes an essential repair factor in double-stranded dna breaks  <cit> . its elevated expression may be a response to diabetes-induced dna damage in renal proximal tubule cells  <cit> . the protective role of p <dig> in reducing assault on the kidney by diabetes-induced dna damage, may in turn, result in decreased levels of nhej <dig>  thus, implicating genotoxicity as a mechanism in renal injury.

ept <dig>  and selm , genes related to the selenoprotein gene family, were also in the group regulated by both diabetes and p <dig>  ept <dig> is involved in the formation and maintenance of vesicular membranes with relevance to golgi function  <cit> , while selm codes for a selenocysteine containing protein that maintains redox balance and is linked to obesity and amyloid beta aggregation in the brain  <cit> . both genes were upregulated by diabetes with expression reversed by treatment. these along with txnrd <dig>  which plays a role in oxidative stress and hyperglycemic events  <cit>  form a cluster of genes with roles in selenium metabolism and oxidative stress that may be linked to renal damage. ugt1a and mamdc <dig>  which were downregulated and cyp4a <dig> and kdm4b, which were upregulated in diabetes by 2- <dig> fold also had near complete restoration of expression levels to control by p <dig>  ugt1a genetic variants predict high risk for type  <dig> diabetes mortality  <cit>  while mamdc <dig> deletions are associated with a group of inflammatory axial diseases  <cit> . cyp4a <dig> ko mice have increased hypertension and develop diabetic nephropathy when treated with streptozotocin  compared to wild-type treated with stz  <cit>  and kdm4b, a lysine demethylase, plays a role in regulating chromatin structure  <cit> . given their regulation by both diabetes and p <dig> treatment, and their association with important metabolic functions, these genes are candidate biomarkers with clinical relevance in dn.

we also noted that expression changes in some genes were unique to early or late stage diabetes suggesting that some pathological events/pathways in the diabetic kidney transcriptome are stage-specific. on the other hand since ~64% of the gene changes in the kidney were similar in the two stages of diabetes, it can be argued that most of the pathology in dn are initiated at a very early stages of the disease. intervention at either stage with p <dig> is likely to reduce diabetic insult to the kidney, as we have previously shown  <cit> , through its regulation of these genes. genes regulated by diabetes and not reversed by treatment are likely to be important as well and may be clustered in yet unknown pathways, which could represent metabolic responses to hyperglycemia that may or may not result in deleterious pathological consequences.

ipa analysis showed mitochondrial dysfunction as the most significantly regulated pathway by diabetes. it was enriched with the highest number  of kidney genes showing expression changes in diabetes. after treatment those numbers were reduced by ~85-90% relative to controls. this analysis strongly implicates mitochondrial dysfunction as a key event in the development of dn, regardless of whether it is a primary or secondary target of diabetes, and provides unequivocal evidence for the utility of p <dig> treatment in its management. in addition, since treatment reversed several diabetes-induced changes in both early and late stage pathology, the p <dig> peptide has broader clinical relevance for the disease. other canonical pathways enriched by diabetes-regulated genes were fatty acid metabolism, nrf2-mediated oxidative stress, oxidative stress, and those implicated in renal injury, many of which were less populated after treatment.

non-coding transcripts including mirna, snrna, and snorna, were some of the most highly regulated molecules in the diabetic kidney. small rnas are known to control the transcriptome, kinome and proteome domains and are involved in normal and pathological gene regulation. many that showed changes in expression with diabetes were also reversed in the direction of these changes after p <dig> treatment suggesting that members of this group, with functions yet unknown, are important in development and progression of the disease as well as in understanding its future management.

the ins2
akita mouse is a good model of type i diabetes. however, it will be interesting to see how many of the diabetes-induce gene expression changes we have documented are common to type ii diabetes and how many are found in other diabetic complications such as diabetic retinopathy.

CONCLUSIONS
diabetes altered expression of a group of coding and non-coding genes in the d <dig> b6-ins2
akita/matbj model of dn. treatment of diabetic mice with p <dig> reversed expression of a specific subset of these genes. these may be key regulators of diabetes-induced kidney dysfunction as p <dig> was previously shown to reduce physiological and pathological features of dn. while the precise roles of these genes in dn pathology remain unclear, they give initial clues to how the disease develops. our study provides a set of unique biomarkers to be exploited in dn and other diabetic complications and suggests that the pedf-p <dig> peptide holds promise for the management of this disease.
