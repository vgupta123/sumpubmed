BACKGROUND
robustness, a fundamental and ubiquitously observed phenomenon in biological systems, is defined as the ability to maintain stable functioning in the face of various perturbations, and is characterized as genetic or environmental robustness, depending on whether the perturbations are inheritable or not  <cit> . genetic robustness describes insensitivity of a phenotype facing genetic mutations, and the insensitivity to environmental factors is called environmental robustness. phenotype robustness appears at various levels of biological systems, including gene expression, protein folding, metabolic flux, physiological homeostasis, development, and even organism fitness  <cit> . it is consequently not surprising that biologists have a long-standing interest in robustness, going back to fisher's work on dominance  <cit> , and to waddington's developmental canalization research  <cit> . hiroaki kitano argues that the requirements for robustness and evolvability are similar, since robustness facilitates evolution and evolution favours robust traits  <cit> . a proper understanding of the origin of robustness in biological systems will catalyze our understanding of evolution  <cit> .

the evolution of mechanism underlying the buffering of the phenotype against genetic and environmental influences has received much theoretical and experimental attention in recent years, yet the evolutionary origin of the observed robustness remains unresolved. whether it is a consequence of natural selection or a nonadaptive correlated side-effect of other phenotypic traits is by and large unknown. a recent review article categorized the theories addressing the evolution of genetic robustness into three main classes: adaptive, intrinsic, and congruent  <cit> . the most straightforward explanation for the evolution of robustness, according to the darwinian tradition, is adaptive robustness. in this scenario, almost all mutations lead to deviations from the optimum, and robustness is favored by natural selection. high mutation rates, large populations, and asexual reproduction generally favor the evolution of robustness  <cit> . genetic robustness may also evolve simply because buffering is a necessary consequence of character adaptation; that is, robustness is a nonadaptive correlated side effect of the stabilizing selection acting on other traits  <cit> . additionally, because environmental perturbations often have a higher frequency and stronger impact on fitness, they will serve as the driving force; that is, genetic robustness evolves as a correlated side-effect of the evolution for environmental robustness. this is an appealing hypothesis as there is no aspect of an organism that is inherently and persistently vulnerable to genetic but not environmental perturbations  <cit> . support for this theory comes from a recent computational study of rna secondary structure by ancel and fontana  <cit> , who find that rna shapes that are robust against environmental  perturbations are also robust against mutational perturbations. simplified modeling of protein structures suggests that a similar correlation between genetic robustness and thermodynamic stability might also exist for proteins  <cit> . further supports come from recent studies of heat-shock proteins, such as hsp <dig> and groel, which are thought to have evolved to protect organisms from environmental and developmental perturbations, but appear to also buffer against genetic perturbation in drosophila  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , and escherichia coli  <cit> . however, to date, the extent to which each of these evolutionary forces contributes to the evolution of robustness remains unresolved, partly due to the difficulty in providing evidence for robustness in natural biological systems  <cit> .

addressing this challenge, recent studies have resorted to bioinformatics and experimental approaches. one important effort to provide the evidence of environmental robustness has focused on the thermodynamic stability of noncoding rna secondary structures  <cit> . although the shuffling sequences generated in these studies rule out the bias of base composition, they do not preserve the structural phenotype of the native rna sequences. consequently, it cannot be determined whether the observed increased robustness goes beyond the intrinsic robustness of specific, functionally important structures. comparing with environmental robustness, genetic robustness, on the other hand, is connected with major technical difficulties  <cit> . the classical approach has inferred genetic robustness from the increase in genetic variance after a major mutation or exposure to an environmental challenge during development  <cit> , as exemplified by the measurements of vibrissae number in mice, ocelli in d. subobscura, and wing- and cross-vein interruptions and scutellar bristle numbers in d. melanogaster, which are all discussed in detail by scharloo  <cit> . however, the evidence is often indirect and suffers from the lack of a natural reference genotype  <cit> . experimental evolution is a more direct approach that has been applied to the study of robustness recently, which utilizes direct laboratory observation of short-term evolutionary processes, mostly in microbes  <cit> . although its evolutionary potential is limited by time constraints, this approach does not suffer from a lack of control and promises exciting new data and insights for a more comprehensive theory of the evolution of genetic robustness  <cit> .

using a plausible background model is another strategy applied to elucidate the evolution of robustness, allowing evaluation of the significance of any greater robustness found in the wild-type   <cit> . wagner and stadler have compared the mutational stability of conserved and non-conserved elements in the secondary structure of a rna viral genome with respect to point mutations, using non-conserved elements as the reference set  <cit> . their research has demonstrated that the conserved elements show a consistently lower variability than non-conserved elements, suggesting that the virus evolves to a state of increased mutational robustness. while their data do not prove that selection that acts directly on the mutational stability of the rna secondary structure, increases thermodynamic stability, this study do provide the first hint that "genetic canalization"  can, in fact, evolve as a correlated response to selection for "environmental canalization" , as predicted by population genetic models  <cit> . on the other hand, experimental studies have demonstrated that mirna secondary structures are tolerant to some structural changes  <cit> , with reports that mirna precursors exhibit a significantly higher level of thermodynamic stability  <cit> . we therefore hypothesize that mirna genetic robustness may evolve as a correlated side effect of the evolution for environmental robustness. to our knowledge, no systematic effort has been made to test this hypothesis in a genome-wide scale, with the exception of an experimental study on the effect of single point mutation for limited mirnas  <cit> .

previous researches have demonstrated that mirnas are abundant endogenous ~22-nucleotide  noncoding rnas, occupying between 1–5% of the genes in any given animal genome  <cit> . mirnas regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level for cleavage or translational repression through the binding of a minimal-recognition 'seed' sequence  <cit> . recent comparative phylogenetic studies have revealed that conserved mirna-binding sequences are in more than one-third of all genes, suggesting that mirna regulation may be relevant to a large portion of cellular processes  <cit> . mature mirnas are cleaved from ~ <dig> nt precursors  that fold into a stem-loop hairpin structure, through the action of dicer endonuclease  <cit> . the mirna stem-loop structure is conserved in evolution, and plays a crucial role throughout mirna gene maturation processing steps  <cit> . additionally, there is a selective pressure to stabilize the stem-loop structure and some structural changes are tolerated  <cit> , which may result in the evolution of robustness. as well, the use of program packages for rna secondary structure prediction, such as mfold  <cit>  and vienna rna package  <cit> , facilitates genotype-phenotype mapping and measurement of the structural robustness of a given mirna stem-loop sequence, by comparing the predicted structure of this sequence with the predicted structure of all its one-mutant neighbors. different types of reference sequences, with similar phenotypes and/or with exact or nearly exact mononucleotide and dinucleotide base composition as the real pre-mirna, can be easily generated for mirnas, allowing for careful control of the effects of secondary structure evolution. these merits make the mirna stem-loop structure an ideal system to study the evolution of genetic robustness.

in our previous study, we have developed a method to quantitatively measure the genetic robustness of rna secondary structure  <cit> . here, we will apply this method to investigate the robustness of  <dig>  mirna genes from six different species. our data suggest that the hairpin structures of mirna precursors exhibit a significantly higher level of mutational robustness. additionally, through the careful design of reference backgrounds, we show that this excess robustness goes beyond the intrinsic robustness of the stem-loop structure, and is not the byproduct of a base composition bias. examination of the environmental robustness of real mirna stem-loops also demonstrates that the phenotype of mirnas buffers against genetic variations, at the same time is insensitive to environmental perturbations. these data suggest that the increase in genetic robustness may evolve as a correlated side effect of the evolution for environmental robustness.

the mononucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies of an rna sequence, not preserved in random sequences, are crucial for the physical stability of the secondary structure  <cit> . it is consequently essential to verify that the greater robustness of real pre-mirnas is not a byproduct of a bias in the base composition of the real pre-mirna sequences, compared with random sequences. to this end, we generate four types of shuffled mirnas that preserve the exact or nearly exact mononucleotide and dinucleotide base composition as the real pre-mirna . the robustness γ1m

due to the correlation between the thermodynamic stability of the minimum free energy structure of a given sequence and its genetics robustness  <cit> , the increased genetic robustness described above may arise from the increased thermodynamic stability of mirnas, as recently reported by bonnet et al.  <cit> . if so, genetic robustness may have evolved as a correlated side effect of environmental robustness. here, we not only examine the thermodynamic stability of mirnas in an analogous manner to that done by bonnet et al.  <cit>  but also using a background model, based on random and shuffled pseudo pre-mirnas, that maintain the stem-loop structure as in the real pre-mirna . figure  <dig> graphs p-value against z-score of environmental robustness for all the  <dig>  mirnas, and the corresponding p-value distribution is showed in figure  <dig>  comparison with random sequences suggests  <dig> out of  <dig>   show a high level of thermodynamic stability at fdr-controlled p-value of <  <dig> , similar to that previously reported  <cit>  . as comparing with random pseudo pre-mirnas, significant thermodynamic stability is also observed in most mirnas  at fdr-controlled p-value of <  <dig> , suggesting that it is not a byproduct of the special stem-loop structure . there are also a high proportion of mirna sequences at each fdr-controlled p-value , when compared with the four types of shuffling sequences. over 90% of the  <dig>  mirna sequences show a high level of thermodynamic stability at fdr-controlled p-value of <  <dig> , based on four types of shuffled methods . there is also a high proportion of mirnas  with fdr-controlled p-value <  <dig>  as filter . the reference sets of shuffled pseudo pre-mirnas generated for each mirna are utilized to further confirm that the increased thermodynamic stability is not the product of the specific stem-loop structure . our data suggest that more than  <dig> of the  <dig>   mirna sequences show a high level of thermodynamic stability at fdr-controlled p-value of <  <dig> , with a high proportion  is also observed at fdr-controlled p-value of <  <dig>  . additionally, examining the thermodynamic stability of mirna genes within species provides a similar picture for each species separately .

we also investigate the correlation between genetic robustness and thermodynamic stability of mirna. figure  <dig> shows the scatter plots of z-scores of genetic and environmental robustness for all the  <dig>  mirnas. although a strong correlation is not observed , most of the significantly genetic robust mirna genes exhibit significant thermodynamic stability at the same time. of the  <dig>  mirna genes investigated,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mirnas are showed significantly genetic and environmental robustness with fdr-controlled p-value of <  <dig>  , compared with random sequences and random pseudo pre-mirnas, respectively. these also can be seen from the 3d histogram plots of z-scores of genetic and environmental robustness . furthermore, the correlation between the genetic and environmental robustness is not a byproduct of a base composition bias . our results demonstrate that the stem-loop structures of mirnas buffer against genetic variations, at the same time is also insensitive to environmental perturbations, indicating that the increase in genetic robustness may evolve as a correlated side effect of the evolution for environmental robustness.

discussion
there has been a growing interest of evolutionary biologists in the origins, mechanisms and consequences of robustness  <cit> , which is a fundamental and ubiquitously observed property of biological systems  <cit> . a greater understanding of the evolution of robustness is needed to clarify whether genetic robustness evolved as a direct consequence of natural selection , as a byproduct of stabilizing selection acting on fitness-related traits , or as a correlated response to environmental robustness   <cit> . recent studies have demonstrated that the stem-loop structures of mirna are tolerant to some structural changes and show thermodynamic stability. we therefore hypothesize that the genetic robustness of mirnas may evolve as a correlated side effect of the evolution for environmental robustness in the current study. using the method proposed in our previous study  <cit> , we examine the robustness of  <dig>  mirna genes covering six species, and show that the stem-loop structures of mirna precursors exhibit a significantly higher level of genetic robustness at different fdr-controlled p-values. additionally, we generate a reference background of phenotypes similar to real pre-mirnas , and demonstrate that this excess robustness of mirna genes goes beyond the intrinsic robustness of the stem-loop structure. the effect of base composition bias on robustness is ruled out by careful design of corresponding shuffling reference backgrounds. examination of the environmental robustness of real pre-mirnas also demonstrates that the phenotype of mirna buffers against genetic perturbations, and at the same time is insensitive to environmental perturbations. these results suggest that increased genetic robustness may evolve as a correlated side effect of the evolution for environmental robustness.

pang et al.  <cit>  argue that even slight changes in mirna sequences can fundamentally alter their function, when they interpret the conservation of mirnas and snornas. our data suggest this interpretation might be premature. experimental studies also have demonstrated that stem-loop structures of mirnas are, to a certain degree, tolerant to some structural changes, as exemplified by studies in which no effects are noted resulting from changes in the loop sequence  <cit>  and further suggesting that the sequence/structure requirements for mirna processing are quite lax, in agreement with our results.

a recent study, published during the course of our work, reports that the stem-loop structures of mirna precursors show excess robustness with respect to mutational perturbation, compared with random rna sequences with similar stem-loop structures  <cit> , suggesting that this excess robustness of mirnas goes beyond the intrinsic robustness of the stem-loop hairpin structure. the study further demonstrates that this excess robustness is not the byproduct of a base composition bias. these results are in much agreement with our findings, although the quantitative measures of genetic robustness defined in these two studies are quite different. the authors then reexamine the thermodynamic stability of mirna utilizing the method used by bonnet et al.  <cit> , with a background model based on inversely folded sequences rather than the shuffled sequences, and find that most of the statistical effect vanished, suggesting that the excess robustness of mirna stem-loops is the result of direct evolutionary pressure toward increased robustness. the different conclusions  may have resulted from differences in the reference backgrounds employed. the reference backgrounds in our study are made up of random and shuffled pseudo pre-mirna sequences with preserved phenotypes that are similar to real pre-mirnas . their reference backgrounds, on the other hand, are produced by inverse folding.

on the other hand, hermission and wagner classify robustness as adaptive and intrinsic  <cit> . the adaptive robustness in their definition encompass both adaptive and congruent scenarios within the classification system established by de visser et al.  <cit> . they consider robustness to be adaptive if the buffering of that trait with respect to some source of variation has the target of natural selection. in other words, robust character states are selected because of their reduced variability. according to this view, our study and the study of borenstein and ruppin  <cit>  come to the same conclusion of adaptive robustness, which is a property that evolves for its own sake. the difference is that the natural forces, assumed to be responsible for its evolution, function as a kind of stabilizing selection acting directly on a character, or on some highly correlated pleiotropic trait  <cit> .

our study will facilitate the in silico identification of novel mirnas. computational identification of mirnas is based largely on the phylogenetic conservation and the structural characteristics of mirna precursors  <cit> . a recent study integrating bioinformatics predictions with microarray analysis and sequence-directed cloning, that does not include inter-species conservation, identifies hundreds of new human mirnas, many of which are poorly conserved beyond primates  <cit> . the significantly greater robustness of the mirna stem-loop structures that buffers environmental and genetic perturbations may also facilitate improved mirna identification on a single genome and can serve as a complementary method to filter out random pseudo pre-mirna sequences. our findings may also be utilized for the improvement of in vitro selection or selex , an experimental method for selecting functional rnas from a large pool  of random sequences  <cit> . the use of designed sequences with thermodynamic stability and genetic robustness, in lieu of random sequences, may increase the probability of identifying novel functional rnas.

the in silico approach utilized in the current study is a simple yet powerful, biologically well-grounded model for studying the evolution of genetic robustness. the importance of this computational approach is emphasized by the fact that the large numbers of perturbations  analyzed here are not easily studied in laboratory experiments. although this in silico study can not completely rule out all alternative hypotheses, the carefully designed reference background model and the statistical analysis of the results strongly support the hypothesis of congruent evolution of robustness. a greater understanding of the evolution of robustness will require quantitative knowledge of the forces producing robustness, such as the distribution of fitness effects of mutations  <cit> . further researches are needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of the evolution of robustness.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study investigate the evolutionary origin of genetic robustness – a fundamental evolutionary molecular biology problem which has not been fully elucidated. we have shown that mirna stem-loop structures exhibit a significantly higher level of genetic robustness at different fdr-controlled p-values, which goes beyond the intrinsic robustness of the stem-loop structure and is not a byproduct of a base composition bias. furthermore, we have demonstrated that the phenotypes of mirnas buffer against genetic perturbations, and at the same time are also insensitive to environmental perturbations. our findings suggest that the increased robustness of mirna stem-loops may evolve as a correlated side effect of evolution for environmental robustness.
