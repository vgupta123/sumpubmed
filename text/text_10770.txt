BACKGROUND
the human gene cc3/tip <dig> was originally identified as a metastasis-suppressor of variant small cell lung carcinoma   <cit> . cc <dig> is a phylogenetically conserved protein whose expression is absent or much reduced in a variety of aggressive or metastatic tumors such as vsclc  <cit> , neuroblastoma and glioblastoma  <cit> , metastatic breast cancer  <cit> , gastric cancer  <cit> , hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> , colorectal carcinomas  <cit>  and lung cancers with poor prognosis  <cit> . forced expression of cc <dig> in vsclc  <cit> , mouse melanoma, breast carcinoma  <cit> , hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit>  and gastric carcinoma cell lines  <cit>  inhibits metastatic behavior in vitro and/or metastasis in vivo. the deletion of cc <dig> in germline results in spontaneous tumorigenesis in mice  <cit> , and cc3-null mammary epithelial cells undergo immortalization in vitro  <cit>  indicating that cc <dig> could be not only a metastasis suppressor, but also a tumor suppressor  <cit> . one study on the role of tip <dig> in metastasis reported that tip <dig> expression actually enhances growth and metastatic behavior of prostate carcinoma cells in vitro  <cit> , but majority of published results support the hypothesis that cc3/tip <dig> suppresses tumor development and metastasis.

high levels of acutely overexpressed exogenous cc <dig> induce apoptosis  <cit>  while stable expression of exogenous cc <dig> results in sensitization of cells to apoptosis after treatment with a variety of factors such as serum withdrawal, cytotoxic drugs, γ-irradiation, and microtubule poisons  <cit> . expression of cc <dig> in cc3-negative tumor cells has an inhibitory effect on the ability of these cells to produce angiogenic factors in vitro  <cit> , consistent with the conclusion that down regulation of cc <dig> contributes to the development of aggressive metastatic phenotypes.

the precise cellular function of cc <dig> remains obscure. a significant sequence homology was reported between cc <dig> and short-chain dehydrogenases-reductases or sdrs  <cit> . cc <dig> sequence contains a domain, well conserved between cc <dig> and sdr enzymes, that was predicted to serve as a nadp binding site  <cit> , and the structural analysis of cc <dig> protein confirmed this prediction  <cit> . a clue to the potential cellular function of cc <dig> came from the findings that cc <dig> plays an unanticipated inhibitory role in the regulation of nuclear transport  <cit> . cc <dig> binds directly to the karyopherins of the importin β family in a rangtp-insensitive manner and associates with nucleoporins in vivo. cc <dig> inhibits nuclear import of proteins with either the classic nuclear localization signal  recognized by importin α:β <dig>  or the m <dig> signal recognized by transportin . cells modified to express higher levels of cc <dig> are predisposed to apoptosis and have a slower rate of nuclear import  <cit> . cc <dig> protein with mutated nadp binding site lacks pro-apoptotic activity, is displaced from transportin by rangtp, and fails to inhibit nuclear import in vitro and in vivo. our results suggest that the ability of cc <dig> to form a rangtp resistant complex with importins and the npc is central to its ability to inhibit nuclear import and induce apoptosis  <cit> .

an independent confirmation for the function of cc <dig> as a negative regulator of nuclear transport came from other studies. cc <dig> was shown to be aberrantly expressed in the oligodendrocyte precursors found in the lesions associated with multiple sclerosis. these high levels of cc <dig> cause the arrest of the nuclear import of the intracellular domain of notch . in these cells ncid, rather that accumulating in the nuclei, is sequestered in cytoplasm in a complex with importin and cc3/tip <dig>  <cit> . the observed lack of the nuclear translocation of nicd leads to the failure of remyelinaiton that could play a causative role in pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis  <cit> .

the function of cc <dig> in nuclear transport is likely to be evolutionarily conserved. a large scale two-hybrid analysis of the yeast proteome uncovered that the s. cerevisiae homologue of cc <dig>  yer004w, interacts with exportin crm <dig> and with ntf <dig>  <cit> , the import factor for rangdp. global analysis of yeast transcriptome changes after exposure to dna damaging treatments strongly indicates that cc <dig> might be also involved in the dna damage responses. the yeast homologue of cc <dig>  yer004w belongs to a small group of nine genes that are known as "dna damage signature set"  <cit> . transcription of this group of genes, including yer004w, is increased significantly and specifically after several different types of dna damage in a mec <dig> -dependent manner  <cit> . additionally, six of the genes in the dna damage signature set, among them yer004w, are expressed at higher levels in the dna2- <dig> replication mutant that undergoes premature aging most likely due to the spontaneously accumulating dna damage  <cit> . these data, and the possibly conserved role of yer004w in nuclear transport in yeast, indicate that the yeast homologue of cc <dig> could be involved in control of nuclear transport in response to dna damage.

we have initiated this work to examine the potential role of human cc <dig> in regulation of dna damage responses. we report here that enforced expression of exogenous cc <dig> significantly impairs the repair of dna after exposure to uv and oxidative agent as well as negatively influences cell survival, while silencing of endogenous cc <dig> in human cells has a mild delaying effect on repair of uv induced damage. our results are consistent with findings that demonstrate a role for cc <dig> in decreasing cell survival in response to a variety of death signals including dna damage.

RESULTS
excess of cc <dig> impairs the repair of dna damage
for the initial assessment of the potential effects of cc <dig> on repair of uv induced dna damage we have employed the host cell reactivation assay . hcr is a transfection-based assay in which cells repair transfected uv damaged reporter plasmid. through measurement of the activity of a reporter enzyme, the relative amount of damaged plasmid that a cell can "reactivate" or repair, and express, can be quantified. we have used a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid damaged by uv and a renilla luciferase plasmid as an internal control of the transfection efficiency. these luciferase plasmids were co-transfected into recipient hela cells along with the effector plasmids , and dual luciferase activity assays were performed  <dig> hours after transfection.

cc <dig> expression vectors for wild type cc <dig> and the mutant version with a mutation in the nadph binding site, as well as the empty vector, were used as effector plasmids. the mutant version of cc <dig>  does not bind to importins in a ran-independent manner, and does not inhibit nuclear transport  <cit> . results in figure 1a show that expression of wild type but not mutant cc <dig> negatively affects repair of dna damage. transfection of twice higher amount of wild type cc <dig> vector  had a stronger inhibitory effect of the repair of dna damage  indicating a dose response relationship between the amounts of cc <dig> and inhibition of dna repair.

to confirm the inhibitory role of cc <dig> in uv induced dna damage repair, hcr was conducted in cc3-negative glioblastoma cell line u <dig> stably transfected with exogenous cc <dig> . out of several cc3-negative transformed cell lines that were stably transfected with cc <dig>  <cit> , we have chosen the u <dig> cells because, unlike in other lines, expression of exogenous cc <dig> had no noticeable effect on the proliferation rate of u <dig>  and did not induce an appreciable increase in their susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli such as uv irradiation or dna damaging drugs . this allowed monitoring the repair of dna damage without interference from the different growth rates or from differential induction of cell death by uv. a control clone transfected with empty vector  and a clone expressing moderate levels of cc <dig>  were used in hcr assay with luciferase reporters. figure 1c shows that in u373neo cells the repair is more efficient that in u373cc <dig>  thus confirming the inhibitory effect of cc <dig> on dna damage repair in an additional cellular context.

stably expressed exogenous cc <dig> delays repair of both cpds and 6-4pps
irradiation of cells with uvc light induces two major types of mutagenic dna photoproducts: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers  and pyrimidine  pyrimidone photoproducts . the latter are repaired relatively quickly, while repair of cpds can continue for periods well over  <dig> hours. we have used the comet assay to examine repair of 6-4pp and other fast-repaired lesions such as oxidized nucleotides and apurinic/apyrimidininc bases, while cpds were detected with a specific antibody by elisa. figure 2a shows that repair of 6-4pp is significantly delayed in u373cc <dig> cells. in control cells the maximum number of breaks, resulting from recognition and excision of damaged bases, was observed at  <dig> minutes after exposure, whereas in u373cc <dig> cells the maximum number of comets was observed at  <dig> hours after exposure. this suggests that the process of damage recognition and/or excision is delayed in u373cc <dig> cells, while the fill-in synthesis and ligation proceed normally, because by  <dig> hours after exposure both clones have mostly repaired the fast-repaired uv-induced lesions.

repair of cpd was monitored over a period of  <dig> hours. figure 2b shows that removal of cpd is also significantly delayed in u373cc <dig> cells, and after  <dig> hours 60% of cpds remain unrepaired in dna from u373cc <dig> cells versus less than 40% in control cells.

we have examined if delays in dna damage repair observed in u373cc <dig> cells have an effect on cell viability or proliferation. cell death assays  showed no appreciable apoptosis or non-apoptotic cell death in either of u <dig> clones subjected to uv at  <dig> j/m <dig> . the short term  cell proliferation was quantified using cck- <dig> assay, and figure 2c shows that proliferation after uv exposure was somewhat slower in u373cc <dig> cells, but the decrease was relatively minor. the colony formation after uv exposure was affected by cc <dig> only slightly, decreasing the number of colonies formed by u373cc <dig> cells by  <dig> to 10% compared to u373neo . glioblastoma cells are notoriously resistant to death induced by dna damage, and expression of cc <dig> apparently does not affect the apoptotic resistance of these cells.

silencing of cc <dig> has a modest effect on the repair of cpd lesions
we have next examined if silencing of cc <dig> expression affects the efficiency of dna damage repair. expression of cc <dig> was silenced in mcf10a cells, which derive from immortalized normal mammary epithelium . these cells were infected with lentivirus expressing cc <dig> specific shrna and puromycin resistance gene, and after selection the infected population showed very little residual expression of cc <dig> . examination of the fast branch of repair of the uv induced dna damage  did not detect any significant differences in the rate of repair . however, repair of cpd as measured by elisa showed a somewhat slower kinetic of cpd removal in mcf10a cells with silenced cc <dig>  though at  <dig> hours similar percentages of cpd were repaired in both cell populations . this was somewhat unexpected considering that the exogenously expressed cc <dig> has an inhibitory effect on repair of cpd lesions .

to examine if the results obtained using mcf10a cells with silenced cc <dig> are unique to this cell line, we have silenced cc <dig> expression in a breast cancer cell line mcf <dig>  we have again observed a modest delay in the removal of cpd . to further confirm these results, we performed immunoblot analysis of dna from uv-irradiated cells with a different anti-cpd antibody. as shown in figure 3d, the delay in repair in cells with silenced cc <dig> was also detected by blotting assay in mcf <dig> cells, as well as in mcf10a cells . this confirms that the reduction in the levels of endogenous cc <dig> has a modest delaying effect on repair of uv induced dna damage. this minor delay in the repair of cpd in absence of cc <dig> had no effect on the viability of cells after uv exposure . however, we have observed that silencing of cc <dig> had a negative effect on cell proliferation after uv exposure .

changes in gene expression in cells forced to express cc3
to address the possible causes of the impaired repair of uv induced dna damage we have conducted expression array analysis of u373neo and u373cc <dig> cells, before and after treatment with uv. the array analysis showed expression changes in a large number of transcripts in untreated u373cc <dig> cells compared to u373neo . these transcripts represented genes that could be involved in a wide variety of cellular processes. examination of genes induced by uv exposure showed that in general transcriptional responses to uv of u <dig> cells with or without cc <dig> expression are very similar; i.e. same mrnas are induced or repressed in both cell lines, with a few exceptions . this indicates that the transcriptional program induced by uv remains essentially unchanged in presence of exogenous cc <dig> 

two of the transcriptional changes observed in cc <dig> expressing cells versus parental u <dig> cells could be directly related to the differences in the uv induced dna damage repair between the clones. array results showed a rather high upregulation of the c-fos transcript  in untreated u373cc <dig> cells versus u373neo, and  <dig>  fold downregulation of ddb <dig> . c-fos is an early response gene induced by uv  <cit> , and was shown to be required for the efficient repair of the uv-induced dna damage  <cit> . ddb <dig>  also known as xeroderma pigmentosum group e, is intimately involved in the nucleotide excision repair  of dna damage by recruiting ubiquitinating protein complex of ddb1-cullin 4a  <cit> .

changes in the expression of the rna for c-fos were examined by quantitative rt-pcr. we have also examined expression of egr <dig>  an early response gene induced, among other treatments, by uv  <cit> , because the array results showed upregulation of egr- <dig> in untreated u373cc <dig> cells versus u373neo . u373cc <dig> cells showed a major increase in transcription of c-fos and egr <dig> compared to u373neo , but the protein levels of c-fos  and egr- <dig>  in untreated u <dig> clones were not affected indicating that the increase in c-fos transcription in u373cc <dig> cells does not results in the increase in protein levels. the array analysis also showed that uv induces c-fos in u373neo cells  but not in u373cc <dig> . western blotting confirmed induction of c-fos protein by uv only in u373neo cells . to examine if cc3-induced inhibition of c-fos induction by uv is unique to u <dig> cells, we have analyzed levels of c-fos in cc <dig> null hepg <dig> cells transduced with a cc <dig> expressing lentivirus. similar to u <dig> cells, exogenous cc <dig> also had a delaying effect on the repair of cpd lesions in transduced hepg <dig> cells . figure 4b shows that introduction of cc <dig> into hepg <dig> resulted in increase of basal c-fos levels in untreated cells , but, similar to the observations with u <dig> cells, prevented increase in c-fos after uv exposure. these data indicate that exogenous cc <dig> might prevent induction of c-fos by relatively low doses of uv . we have not detected any effect of cc <dig> on subcellular localization of c-fos which was exclusively nuclear in all cells .

we have then examined expression of c-fos in cells with silenced cc <dig>  expecting that perhaps the latter will have an enhancing effect on c-fos induction by uv. indeed, while there was no change in the basal levels of c-fos in mcf10a cells with silenced cc <dig>  induction of this protein by uv was much higher in mcf10a cells with silenced cc <dig> . these observations suggest that both endogenous and exogenous cc <dig> might restrain induction of c-fos by uv in different cellular contexts.

next, we examined expression of ddb <dig> protein in cell lines where cc <dig> expression was manipulated. figure 5a shows that the basal levels of ddb <dig> are lower in u373cc <dig> cells, in agreement with transcriptional downregulation found in the expression array analysis . the basal levels of ddb <dig> protein were found to be higher in both mcf10a and mcf <dig> cells where cc <dig> was silenced . these data indicate that cc <dig> has an inhibitory affect on expression of ddb <dig>  we have examined the subcellular localization of ddb <dig> protein in various lines used above, but ddb <dig> was nuclear in all cells. we suggest that lower levels of ddb <dig> could be directly relevant to the delay in repair seen in u373cc <dig> cells.

cc <dig> expression increases levels and nuclear localization of p21cip1
in a recent publication, cc <dig> was reported to regulate levels of p <dig> and p21waf1/cip <dig>  via stabilization of their mrnas  <cit> . in addition, p <dig> protein levels have been shown to be regulated by ddb <dig>  <cit> . we have therefore examined if manipulation of cc <dig> affects the levels of p21cip <dig> because p21cip <dig> was shown to be involved in the uv induced dna damage response in numerous publications. western blot analysis of u <dig> cells for p21cip <dig> showed somewhat lower levels in u373cc <dig> cells compared to u373neo, and disappearance of detectable p <dig> after uv exposure. we could not reliably examine the subcellular localization of p21cip <dig> by immunofluorescence in u <dig> cells because these cells have very low levels of p21cip <dig> most likely due to the lack of functional p <dig> 

we have therefore examined levels and localization of p <dig> in cc <dig> protein null hepg <dig> cells that express p <dig>  hepg <dig> cells were transduced with a cc <dig> expressing lentivirus  or a control vector . expression of exogenous cc <dig> in hepg <dig> cells lead to a decrease in the basal levels of p21cip <dig>  and prevented the increase in its levels and nuclear localization after uv exposure observed in hepg2con cells . changes in levels and localization of p21cip <dig> in cells with exogenously expressed cc <dig> are likely independent of p53-dependent regulation of p <dig>  because the levels of p <dig> were only marginally affected by cc <dig> expression , and the exclusively nuclear localization of p <dig> in hepg <dig> cells was not affected by cc <dig> .

examination of mcf10a and mcf <dig> cells with silenced cc <dig> showed that in both cell lines abrogation of cc <dig> protein expression leads to increased basal levels of p <dig>  but no further increase at  <dig> hours after uv exposure, unlike in control cells . silencing of cc <dig> did not affect the levels of p <dig> in cells before or  <dig> hours after uv exposure  . we have examined the subcellular localization of p21cip <dig> in cells before and after uv irradiation. in untreated cells, similar percentages of cells had predominantly nuclear p21cip <dig> irrespective of their cc <dig> status, but exposure to uv led to the nuclear accumulation of p21cip <dig> in a higher percentage of cc3-silenced cells . we have not detected changes in localization of p <dig> protein as a consequence of cc <dig> silencing . we conclude that lack of cc <dig> expression leads to increased nuclear localization of p <dig> after dna damage.

even though p21cip <dig> has been implicated in regulation of dna damage repair itself, some older and recent publications suggest that it is a negative regulator of the translesion  dna synthesis after uv exposure. to examine if tsl is affected in mcf10cc3-si cells, we have examined the rate of dna synthesis after uv exposure. figure 5f shows that the number of cells in s phase after uv irradiation was significantly reduced in mcf10acc3-si cells, which have higher levels of p <dig> that the control cells . considering that the effect of cc <dig> silencing on the efficiency of dna repair was relatively minor in mcf10a and mcf <dig> cells , we conclude that the silencing of cc <dig> has a minor effect on the efficiency of dna repair but strongly impairs the translesion dna synthesis probably through increase in levels of nuclear p <dig> 

exogenous cc <dig> affects repair of oxidative dna damage
we have examined if repair of oxidative dna damage is also affected by the exogenously introduced cc <dig> expression. u <dig> clones were treated with hydrogen peroxide for a short time and allowed to recover in fresh medium. repair of oxidative damage was monitored by comet assay. figure 6a shows that cells expressing cc <dig> have a decreased capacity for the repair of oxidative lesions in dna. a similar deficiency in the repair of oxidative dna damage was observed in a small cell lung carcinoma cells n <dig>  forced to express exogenous cc <dig> .

the array expression analysis of u <dig> clones  identified nucleoredoxin  <cit> , a gene of the peroxiredoxin family, as downregulated  <dig>  fold in u373cc <dig> cells. nucleoredoxin  is involved in regulation of wnt signaling pathway during oxidative stress and  <cit> , and similar to the other members of the peroxiredoxin family, could be related to the control of the reactive oxygen species after oxidative insult. we examined levels of nucleoredoxin first by quantitative rt-pcr in u <dig> and n <dig> cell lines with and without cc <dig> and confirmed a very significant decrease in the transcript levels in presence of cc <dig> .

next, we have examined the levels of the nucleoredoxin protein by western blot analysis. unexpectedly, nucleoredoxin levels were not diminished in u373cc <dig> cells compared to u373neo cells in spite of the very significant reduction in rna level . therefore, in u <dig> cells the impairment of the oxidative dna damage repair is unlikely to be a direct or indirect consequence of the reduced levels of nucleoredoxin. in addition, the levels of both endogenous and peroxide treatment induced reactive oxygen species  in u373cc <dig> and u373neo cells were quantitatively similar, as measured by flow cytometric analysis of cells pre-loaded with ros- sensitive probe cm-h2dcfda . analysis of cell survival after treatment with peroxide showed that it is diminished in u <dig> cells , indicating that the delayed repair of oxidative damage might impact cell survival.

because we have observed that in u373cc <dig> cells transcriptional changes are not necessarily "translated" into corresponding changes in protein levels , we have examined expression of nucleoredoxin in other cells stably transfected with cc <dig>  in n417cc <dig> cells nucleoredoxin protein was almost undetectable . a significant reduction in nucleoredoxin protein levels was seen in two other lines forced to stably express exogenous cc3: cc3-negative neuroblastoma sknsh and cc3-low breast carcinoma mda mb  <dig> . this suggests that suppression of nucleoredoxin expression by cc <dig> might be a common consequence of forced cc <dig> expression.

discussion
our data show that the forced expression of exogenous cc <dig> and, to a much lesser degree, silencing of endogenous cc <dig> delay the repair of uv induced dna damage. these findings are not entirely contradictory considering the role of cc <dig> in the regulation of nuclear transport. changes in levels of cc <dig> could disrupt the existing balance in the nuclear import and export of any number of shuttling proteins, including those involved in dna damage repair.

we have chosen to examine the possible consequences of forced expression of cc <dig> on dna damage repair in a glioblastoma cell line lacking endogenous cc <dig>  because introduction of cc <dig> did not affect its proliferation rate or sensitivity to death signals, unlike negative effects reported in many other tumor cell lines stably transfected with cc <dig> . therefore, we were able to analyze effects of cc <dig> on dna damage repair apart from the described negative effects of cc <dig> expression on cell survival and growth rate. in retrospect, however, we observed that some transcriptional changes induced by cc <dig> in u <dig> cells did not result in corresponding changes in protein levels . the lack of correlation between a change in a certain mrna level and a corresponding change in level of protein it encodes appears to be limited to u <dig> cells. in particular, the fos protein is induced by cc <dig> in hepg <dig> but not in u <dig> ; nucleoredoxin is downregulated by cc <dig> in three tumor cell lines but not in u <dig> ; vimentin, whose rna is upregulated  <dig> fold in u373cc <dig> cells  is practically unchanged at the protein level, but is strongly induced in n <dig> cells . it appears that the u <dig> cells exercise a strong post-transcriptional control of protein levels in u <dig> cells, either at the level of translation per se, or by altering protein stability. this could be relevant to the ability of these cells to maintain levels of critical proteins that are compatible with the high proliferation rate and apoptotic resistance characteristic for glioblastoma.

we have attempted to identify some of the proteins relevant to dna damage responses whose levels/localization are affected by changes in cc <dig> levels. the rna expression array analysis was based on a rationale that cc <dig> might affect nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of certain transcription factors, which could have consequences for the expression levels of a number genes that are co-regulated by these transcription factors. in particular, we were interested to find if the introduction of cc <dig> into cc3-negative cells might have a generalized effect on transcription changes induced by uv. as seen in the additional file  <dig>  the sets of genes affected by uv in cc3-negative versus cc3-expressing cells are remarkably similar, excepting a few quantitative changes in the degree of suppression/induction. this indicates that cc <dig> expression does not induce a major shift in the transcriptional response to uv.

this is, perhaps, not surprising, considering that cells differing in cc <dig> expression could be expected to have significant changes in subcellular localization of the relevant shuttling proteins rather than changes in their mrna levels. we have detected changes in the expression levels of two proteins closely related to ner: ddb <dig> and p21cip1; in addition, the well-known induction of c-fos by uv was significantly inhibited in cc3-expressing cells, and increased in cc3-silenced cells . the role of ddb2/xpe in ner has been studied extensively, but remains incompletely understood. thus, degradation of ddb <dig> is thought to be essential for the initial stages of ner, but ddb complex activity is dispensable for the ner in vitro . the prevailing notion was that ddb <dig> is an essential part of the uv-activated ddb1-ddb2-cul4a ubiquitin ligase, and as such participates in the initiation of global ner. this complex was variously reported to be responsible for degradation of ddb <dig> itself  <cit>  or ubiquitination of histones at the sites of damage  <cit> . however, a very recent report showed that ablation of cul4a, a ubiquitin ligase in the complex, actually increases the capacity of normal cells to repair uv damaged dna  <cit> . ddb <dig> was shown to act as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor  <cit> , but to complicate the issue further, ddb <dig> is expressed at higher levels in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells, and its knockdown negatively impacts the growth rate of these cells  <cit> . this, however, could be due to the functions that ddb <dig> likely has in cellular processes other than ner. we show that ddb <dig> levels are increased in mcf10a and mcf <dig> cells when cc <dig> expression is silenced, and ddb <dig> levels are decreased in u <dig> cells forced to express cc <dig>  the latter change correlates with a slower kinetics of uv induced dna damage repair. we conclude that expression of cc <dig> has an inhibitory effect on expression of ddb <dig>  and that could play a role in the delay of dna repair.

the role of p21cip1waf/cip <dig> in ner remains controversial, in spite of hundreds of research papers published on the topic. earlier reports indicated that higher levels of p21cip <dig> are not inhibitory for ner, but can inhibit translesion dna synthesis   <cit> , while subsequent publications suggested an inhibitory role of p <dig> in the repair process itself via its interaction with pcna . p <dig> was strongly implicated in the negative regulation of tls, preventing association of polymerase eta with pcna  <cit> . our findings show that increased levels of p21cip <dig> in cells where cc <dig> is silenced correlate with the significant inhibition of tls, but have a minor effect on uv induced dna damage repair.

expression of c-fos was shown to be necessary for the efficient repair of uv-induced dna damage  <cit> , and c-fos negative cells show a significant decrease in their repair capacity. two cell lines expressing exogenously introduced cc <dig>  fail to increase expression of c-fos after uv exposure, which could be a contributing factor to the observed delay in repair. our observations of the complex effects that manipulation of cc <dig> levels has on levels of the three investigated proteins relevant to dna damage responses are illustrated in figure  <dig> 

we have also investigated the effect of manipulating levels of cc <dig> on the dna damage repair and cell survival after oxidative stress. while we could not detect any effects of cc <dig> knockdown on the repair of oxidative dna damage, excess of cellular cc <dig> significantly delayed repair, and, in addition, had a negative effect on cell proliferation. these findings are in agreement with the published results that overexpression of cc <dig> leads to increased sensitivity to the apoptotic induction by oxidative stress  <cit> . an increase in levels of p <dig> and p <dig> proteins trough the stabilization of the p <dig> rna was suggested to play a role in predisposition to apoptosis induced by cc <dig> expression.

it is possible that the delays in repair of oxidative dna damage induced by cc <dig> might contribute to the lower survival of glioblastoma cells expressing exogenous cc <dig> . other cell lines forced to express cc <dig>  also show an impaired survival after treatment with oxidative agents . in these cell lines, the negative effect on viability could be due not only to impaired dna repair, but also to a decrease in levels of nucleoredoxin, induced by cc <dig> . lower levels of nucleoredoxin in cells forced to express cc <dig> could result in lowered ability to neutralize ros, more severe dna and other types of oxidative damage, and consequently more death. indeed, n <dig> cells expressing exogenous cc <dig> have higher levels of endogenous ros as measured by conversion of ros-sensitive probe cm-h2dcfda to fluorescent form . the possible role of nucleoredoxin in this process has not been studied, but peroxiredoxins in general have been implicated in the ability of both saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit>  and mammalian cells  <cit>  to protect themselves from the deleterious effects of oxidative insults on dna repair, genomic stability and survival. nucleoredoxin was shown to act as a negative regulator of the wnt/β-catenin signaling in peroxide-treated cells  <cit> . the long-term consequences of this effect on cell survival have not been investigated. however, assuming that nucleoredoxin shares with other peroxiredoxins the ability to control ros levels, it is reasonable to suggest that lowering levels of cellular nucleoredoxin will have an adverse effect on cell survival after oxidative insult.

CONCLUSIONS
our experiments show that exogenously expressed cc <dig>  by virtue of its effects on levels and subcellular localization of proteins involved in dna damage responses, negatively affects dna damage repair after both uv exposure and oxidative stress. we have identified c-fos, ddb <dig> and p21cip as proteins whose levels or localization are affected by cc <dig>  and these changes are potential culprits in the effects of cc <dig> on cellular responses to uv. our findings are consistent with the known role of cc3/tip <dig> in impairing cell survival after apoptotic treatments and its role as a tumor and metastasis suppressor. inhibition of nuclear transport by cc <dig> most likely plays a role in its activity as metastasis suppressor and cell death promoter. further work will be needed to identify critical proteins whose localization is affected by cc <dig> and impacts responses to dna damage.
