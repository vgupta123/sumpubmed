BACKGROUND
mammalian embryonic development is best understood using the mouse model  <cit> . fertilized eggs develop into a blastocyst by embryonic day  <dig>  . at this stage, the blastocyst is composed of both an inner cell mass , which is fated to become the embryo, and an extraembryonic trophectoderm . the blastocyst implants into the uterus at e <dig> , and during this time the embryo forms the epiblast  and primitive endoderm . during implantation the epi rapidly proliferates and expands to form an egg cylinder, which is composed of both embryonic ectoderm  and extraembryonic ectoderm  covered by visceral endoderm . during egg cylinder expansion, the distal tip of the embryo differentiates into the distal visceral endoderm , establishing a proximal-distal  axis. during the transition from e <dig>  to e <dig> , the dve migrates up the anterior portion of the embryo to create the anterior visceral endoderm  where it has organizer activity through secreting several inhibitors of the tgfb and wnt family ligands. the secretion of these inhibitors constrains tgfb and wnt signaling activity to the posterior portion of the embryo, which promotes the differentiation of the primitive streak and the anterior-posterior  axis.

early mammalian development, and the establishment of asymmetric axes , require coordinated gene expression  <cit> . gene expression is regulated by both transcription factors and epigenetic regulators. both operate within chromatin, which is composed of nucleosomes at its fundamental level  <cit> . essential epigenetic regulators in eukaryotes are chromatin remodeling complexes. chromatin remodeling complexes are usually multi-subunit enzymes that slide or evict nucleosomes, or exchange its histone subunits. these activities change chromatin structure by altering the position, occupancy or composition of nucleosomes  <cit> . in turn, changes in chromatin structure regulate access to the underlying dna, that in turn influences nuclear processes like transcription.

chromatin remodeling complexes are classified into the swi/snf, iswi, chd or ino <dig> families based upon the sequence homology of their atpase subunit  <cit> . in mammals, the ino <dig> family is composed of the srcap, p <dig>  and ino <dig> remodeling complexes. these complexes are large, 12- <dig> subunit, complexes that are unique among chromatin remodeling complexes because they catalyze histone exchange reactions  <cit> . in addition to histone exchange, ino <dig> has significant nucleosome sliding activity, suggesting that it can either alter nucleosome position or occupancy, or change nucleosome composition in vivo. presumably through these activities, ino <dig> regulates a variety of nuclear processes which include transcription, dna repair, dna replication, and telomere structure  <cit> .

while much has been done to characterize the nuclear functions of ino <dig>  little has been done to determine its functions in metazoan development. in plants, ino <dig> is essential for flowering and reproductive organ development, possibly through functions in homologous recombination and regulated transcription  <cit> . in flies, ino <dig> mutants are late embryonic lethal, deregulate hox gene expression, and manifest homeotic transformations  <cit> . in addition to hox genes, ino <dig> regulates ecdysone response genes, which are essential for pupal development and molting  <cit> . localization and nucleosome mapping studies in insect cells show that ino <dig> is widely distributed throughout the genome and remodels nucleosomes onto energetically unfavorable dna sequences  <cit> . similar to studies in plants and flies, mammalian ino <dig> is also essential for development. ex vivo studies with ino <dig> knockout  or shrna knockdown  pre-implantation embryos show that ino <dig> maintains stem self-renewal by promoting the expression of pluripotency factors like oct <dig> and stabilizing dna replication forks  <cit> . in utero, ino <dig> ko embryos implant into the uterus but fail to develop to mid-gestation, possibly due to roles for ino <dig> in regulating telomere structure or dna damage repair  <cit> . because ino <dig> is a well-documented regulator of gene expression, developmental defects could also result from abnormal gene expression  <cit> .

building on these earlier studies, we show that ino <dig> ko embryos fail to specify a dve and a p-d axis in utero. coincident with defects in the dve, ino <dig> ko embryos aberrantly express bmp <dig> in the eme, a known repressor of dve specification  <cit> . molecular studies using differentiating esc models show that ino <dig> is specifically localized to the bmp <dig> promoter, remodels its chromatin structure, and regulates the binding of transcription activators to its dna sequence. these results in combination suggest that ino <dig> directly represses bmp <dig> expression in the eme through its chromatin remodeling activity to promote dve specification and p-d axis establishment.

RESULTS
ino <dig> ko embryos fail to develop beyond the egg cylinder stage
to discover the functions of ino <dig> in mammalian development, we created a conditional ko allele in mice using cre-loxp technology  <cit> . with this strategy, essential exons are flanked by loxp sites that can be excised by tissue-specific cre recombinase expression. the targeted floxed-neo allele  is designed to delete exons 2- <dig> of the ino <dig> gene with cre excision, deleting the initiating atg . to create both the ino <dig> floxed allele  and the ino <dig> deletion allele , we crossed mice carrying our targeted allele to mice constitutively expressing the flp or cre recombinases. successful recombination and germ line transmission of the floxed and ko alleles were identified by southern blotting and pcr-based genotyping strategies .

to determine if our targeted allele resulted in a loss of ino <dig> protein, we crossed a tet inducible cre expression system  into our ino <dig> floxed mice  <cit> . homozygous ino <dig> floxed  mouse embryonic fibroblasts , with or without teto-cre, were isolated from mid-gestation e <dig>  embryos. as expected, the addition of doxycycline to teto-cre, ino <dig> f/f fibroblast cultures resulted in the conversion of the ino <dig> floxed alleles to ino <dig> ko alleles in two days . over this same time course, western blotting demonstrated a complete depletion of the ino <dig> protein by day  <dig> . coincident with the depletion of the ino <dig> protein, we observed a loss of the exons 1- <dig> ino <dig> transcript and the appearance of two smaller ino <dig> transcripts  by rt-pcr . cloning and sequencing these smaller pcr products identified aberrant exon 1- <dig> and exon 1- <dig> splice events for the ino <dig> transcript, with the deletion of exons 2- <dig> by cre-mediated recombination . in silico translation from the first atg of each aberrant splice product results in an out of frame transcript and a random protein product . these results demonstrate that our ino <dig> floxed allele can be successfully excised by cre recombinase, resulting in loss of the ino <dig> protein.

a previous publication showed that mefs depleted of ino <dig> arrest the cell cycle and senesce  <cit> . to determine if depletion of ino <dig> using our ino <dig> floxed allele resulted in similar phenotypes, we counted the number of viable fibroblasts over 12 days post-cre expression by doxycycline exposure. as described previously  <cit> , we observed that after doxycycline exposure ino <dig> ko mefs stopped proliferating and senesced as identified by an increased number of cells positive for endogenous b-gal activity, an indicator of senescence  <cit>  . reproducing previous phenotypes of ino <dig> ko mefs supports the conclusion that our ino <dig> ko allele is a null allele.fig.  <dig> ino <dig> is essential for embryonic fibroblast and early embryonic development. a growth curve of conditional ino <dig> ko mef induced by doxycycline treatment.  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells of control  or ino <dig> ko  were seeded into media containing 10 μg/ml doxycycline. numbers of trypan blue negative cells were counted every two days over a 12-day period . b day- <dig> control and ino <dig> ko cells from panel a were stained for endogenous β-galactosidase activity at ph  <dig>  to measure cellular senescence  <cit> . black arrows designate β-galactosidase positive cells. c quantification of percentage β-galactosidase positive cells for day- <dig> control and ino <dig> ko cells from panel  . d whole mount analysis of e <dig> -, e <dig> -, and e <dig> -day wild-type  and homozygous ino <dig> ko  embryos harvested from +/ino <dig> ko intercross breeding. e length of e <dig> - and e <dig> -day wild-type and ino <dig> ko embryos were measured in whole mount using a calibrated microscope . ko knockout, mef mouse embryonic fibroblasts, e embryonic day



phenotypes for ino <dig> ko embryos are largely uncharacterized. to identify the functions of ino <dig> in mammalian development, we intercrossed mice heterozygous for the ino <dig> ko allele. genotyping litters of mice from this intercross identified no homozygous ino <dig> ko mice, demonstrating that ino <dig> is essential for mouse viability . to stage the earliest point where ino <dig> is required for development, we genotyped litters of embryos at mid-gestation , gastrulation , and peri-implantation . results from these experiments showed that ino <dig> ko homozygous embryos were absent at e <dig> , but present at the expected mendelian ratios at gastrulation  and prior to implantation  . these results demonstrate that ino <dig> is essential for mammalian development post-gastrulation. a gross analysis of ino <dig> ko embryos prior to , during , and post-gastrulation  reveled that ino <dig> is important for expansion of the egg cylinder during gastrulation . quantitation of embryo length showed that the size of ino <dig> ko embryos at e <dig>  is similar to that observed for ino <dig> ko embryos at e <dig>  . embryo reabsorption likely occurs after e <dig>  because ino <dig> ko embryos after e <dig>  begin to show a loss in structural integrity .

ino <dig> ko embryonic stem cells are viable but exhibit an unstable pluripotent state
to characterize roles for ino <dig> in the early embryo, we isolated ino <dig> ko embryonic stem cells  from the icm of pre-implantation e <dig>  ino <dig> ko embryos. collection and genotyping pre-implantation e <dig> -day blastocysts from ino <dig> ko heterozygous intercrosses showed that ino <dig> ko homozygous blastocysts look morphologically similar to wild-type littermates by gross inspection . these same isolated blastocysts successfully attached and outgrew onto gelatinized plates in media containing serum and leukemia inhibitory factor . after seven days of outgrowth, we observed a similar expansion of trophoblasts and the icm between wild-type and ino <dig> ko blastocysts . from these outgrowths, we successfully cloned ino <dig> ko escs under culture conditions that maintain ground state pluripotency   <cit> . western blotting showed that the ino <dig> ko escs do not have the ino <dig> protein, further confirming that our ino <dig> ko allele is a null allele . unlike ino <dig> ko mefs, ino <dig> ko escs proliferate and are not apoptotic when maintained in culture under conditions that promote ground state pluripotency . a microscopic analysis shows that ino <dig> ko escs did not form prototypical undifferentiated colonies and exhibit slight cell scattering when maintained at ground state pluripotency . cell scattering is more pronounced when the escs were passaged in a media formulation that maintains a metastable pluripotent state  . the percentage of colonies that maintain alkaline phosphatase  staining was equivalent between wild-type and ino <dig> ko escs when maintained at ground state pluripotency . however, ino <dig> ko escs did not form robust ap positive colonies if the colony formation assay was repeated when cells were maintained in a metastable state . the ability to form ap positive colonies was recovered if cells maintained in the metastable state are returned to ground state conditions . these results demonstrate that ino <dig> ko escs are viable, ap positive, and morphologically show evidence of slight cell scattering when compared to wild-type controls when maintained at ground state pluripotency. however, ino <dig> ko escs lose ap staining and exhibit cell scattering when grown under conditions that maintain a metastable pluripotent state.fig.  <dig>

to further characterize phenotypes of ino <dig> ko escs grown under differing culture conditions, we measured transcript levels of several markers of pluripotency, stem cell differentiation, and lineage commitment. when maintained at ground state pluripotency, ino <dig> ko escs have equivalent expression of pluripotency markers nanog, oct <dig>  klf <dig>  sox <dig>  and essrb. markers of ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm lineages were also approximately equivalent between wild-type and ino <dig> ko escs . in contrast, we observed reduced pluripotency marker expression  when ino <dig> ko escs were maintained in the metastable state for five days   <cit> . these results are consistent with the metastable pluripotent state, but not ground state pluripotency requiring ino <dig> 

ino <dig> ko escs fail to differentiate using models of mammalian development
to further characterize roles for ino <dig> during mammalian development, we differentiated ino <dig> ko escs using the teratoma model  <cit> . to create teratomas, both wild-type and ino <dig> ko escs maintained at ground state were introduced into opposing flanks of nod/scid mice. teratomas were allowed to grow until control tumors were approximately 1 cm in diameter. from five inoculations, we harvested four wild-type tumors and two ino <dig> ko tumors. a histological analysis showed that control tumors formed a wide range of differentiated tissues from each of the three germ lines. differentiated tissues include blood islands, keratin pearls, and neural rosettes from the ectoderm lineage, both striated and smooth muscle from mesoderm, and ciliated endoderm from the endoderm lineage . in contrast to the well-differentiated tissues observed in wild-type teratomas, we observed that ino <dig> ko teratomas are composed of undifferentiated mesenchyme with a thin layer of epithelial cells on the outer periphery .fig.  <dig> ino <dig> is essential for cell and tissue differentiation. a low-magnification analysis of wild-type and ino <dig> ko esc differentiation as teratomas in nod/scid mice. scale bar = 500 μm. b high-magnification analysis of teratomas derived from wild-type escs showed evidence of  blood islands,  striated muscle,  ciliated endoderm,  neural rosettes,  keratin pearls, and  smooth muscle fields when sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin . teratomas formed from ino <dig> ko escs are composed of  undifferentiated tissue surrounded by a  thin epithelial cell layer. scale bar = 75 μm. c analysis of 9-day embryoid bodies derived from wild-type and ino <dig> ko escs. frozen sections of embryoid bodies derived from wild-type escs stained with h + e showed evidence of dark staining endoderm  and evidence of internal cavitation  as previously described  <cit> . embryoid bodies from ino <dig> ko escs show evidence of disorganized endoderm and other differentiated cell types. scale bar = 200 μm. d gene expression analysis of embryoid bodies derived from either wild-type or ino <dig> ko escs differentiated over nine days. quantitative rt-pcr was used to measure the expression of a variety of differentiation markers, including gata <dig>  gata <dig>  foxa <dig>  hnf4a, wnt <dig>  fgf <dig>  t, fgf <dig>  bmp <dig>  and nodal, and pluripotency markers, including nanog, klf <dig>  sox <dig> and oct <dig>  . ko knockout, esc embryonic stem cell



in addition to forming teratomas, we utilized the embryoid body esc differentiation model  <cit> . to create embryoid bodies, escs maintained at ground state were dispersed in clumps and aggregated in serum containing media without 2i + lif. esc aggregates were then harvested at three-day intervals over the course of nine days. histological analysis of day- <dig> wild-type embryoid bodies provided evidence of differentiated cell types including a well-defined endoderm, and an organized mesenchyme with evidence of cavitation as previously described  <cit>  . in contrast, embryoid bodies derived from ino <dig> ko escs were not well organized and lacked a continuous endoderm . we subsequently used rt-pcr to measure markers of pluripotency and differentiated tissues in the embryoid bodies. from these experiments, we observed that pluripotency marker repression during embryoid body differentiation is largely ino80-independent . in contrast to pluripotency markers, we observed ino80-dependent expression for several differentiation markers during embryoid body differentiation. ino <dig> ko embryoid bodies showed enhanced expression of endoderm markers gata <dig> and gata <dig>  <cit> , and the stem cell maintenance factor bmp <dig>   <cit> . the expression of these markers could be linked since bmp <dig> positively regulates gata <dig> and gata <dig> expression  <cit> . in contrast to these changes, ino <dig> ko embryoid bodies showed reduced expression of the ectoderm marker fgf <dig>  <cit> , the endoderm marker hnf4a  <cit> , and mesoderm markers fgf <dig>  <cit>  and t  <cit>  . because the expression of these markers is essential for embryonic development, ino80-dependece of these same genes could contribute to a post-implantation lethal phenotype.

ino <dig> is expressed in the embryonic and extraembryonic ectoderm of post-implantation embryos
in a first step towards understanding why ino <dig> ko embryos fail to develop beyond e <dig> , we determined where ino <dig> is expressed during embryonic development and in the adult. towards this end, we performed in situ rna hybridization  using both sense and antisense probes to the ino <dig> transcript in e <dig> - to e <dig> -day embryos. whole mount ish of e <dig>  to e <dig>  with sense and antisense ino <dig> probes showed widespread staining of embryos with the antisense probe, but not the sense probe . the most intense staining with the antisense probe was observed in both the eme and exe, and comparatively less staining was observed in the ve . the eme contributes to all cell types of the embryo proper, whereas the exe contributes to the placenta and umbilical cord  <cit> . to better visualize ino <dig> ish, we sectioned e <dig> -day embryos either sagittal or in cross section. inspection of these sections showed that staining with the antisense ino <dig> probe is highest in the exe and eme, with less staining in the ve . consistent with widespread expression in the early embryo, northern blotting for ino <dig> transcripts showed that it is expressed in all adult tissues analyzed . the combination of these results supports the conclusion that ino <dig> is widely expressed in many tissues of post-implantation embryo and the adult.fig.  <dig> 
ino <dig> is widely expressed in embryonic tissues and is essential for establishing the proximal-distal axis of the post-implantation embryo. a whole mount rna in situ hybridization  of e <dig> -, e <dig> -, and e <dig> -day embryos using either sense or antisense ino <dig> riboprobes. all embryos were photographed at identical magnification. extraembryonic ectoderm , embryonic ectoderm  and visceral endoderm  are designated. b increased magnification showing reduced antisense ino <dig> riboprobe staining in the visceral endoderm  in e <dig> -day embryos. embryos were photographed at identical magnification. c frozen sections of e <dig> -day embryos stained whole mount with antisense ino <dig> riboprobe. sagittal and cross sections through the exe and epi were obtained for representative embryos. d whole mount rna in situ hybridization of e <dig> -, e <dig> -, and e <dig> -day embryos was performed with antisense riboprobes for markers of tissue differentiation. markers used include the exe marker , eme marker , mesoderm marker , epi marker , ve marker , and pre/dve/ave markers . embryos were photographed at identical magnification. e whole mount ish of e <dig> -day embryos was performed with antisense probes to the exe marker bmp <dig>  and the eme marker otx <dig> . embryos were photographed at identical magnification. f whole mount analysis of tunel positive cells in wild type and ino <dig> ko e <dig> -day embryos. a representative negative control  is shown. representative tunel positive cells are shown by black arrows. g quantitation of apoptosis as percentage of tunel positive cells from panel f . n =  <dig> wild type  or ino <dig> ko embryos. e embryonic day, epi epiblast, pre primitive endoderm, dve distal visceral endoderm, ave anterior visceral endoderm



ino <dig> ko embryos have a defective distal visceral endoderm and fail to gastrulate
to better understand why ino <dig> ko embryos fail to develop, we used whole mount ish to monitor marker expression for several essential cell types of the gastrulating embryo. we focused our ish on markers previously analyzed from our studies of ino <dig> ko embryoid bodies . in the early embryo, gastrulation occurs at e <dig>  when the posterior of the embryo differentiates into mesoderm and definitive endoderm  <cit> . initial ish experiments documented a lack of mesoderm marker t expression in ino <dig> ko embryos, suggesting that they do not differentiate mesoderm and likely do not gastrulate . gastrulation requires the specification of the ave and is the first organizer of the mammalian embryo. the ave secretes inhibitors to tgfb and wnt ligands including cer, and its expression at e <dig>  is a marker of the ave  <cit> . at e <dig>  cer <dig> is not expressed in the ino <dig> ko embryo, suggesting that ino <dig> is required for ave establishment . in addition to the ave, signaling molecules that originate from the exe are essential for ave establishment and gastrulation  <cit> . one such molecule is the tgfb superfamily member bmp <dig>  <cit> . ish for bmp <dig> transcripts showed that it is weakly expressed in the exe in ino <dig> ko e <dig>  embryos . the results from these analyses demonstrate that ino <dig> ko embryos do not gastrulate and have defects in specifying both the ave and exe.

to determine if defects in gastrulation result from defects at earlier stages of development, we measured tissue differentiation in ino <dig> ko e <dig>  embryos. from these experiments, we observed that bmp <dig>  which is normally expressed in the exe  <cit> , is abnormally expressed in the eme in ino <dig> ko e <dig>  embryos . to further confirm eme bmp <dig> expression we performed a double ish using bmp <dig> and the eme marker otx <dig>  <cit> . from this experiment we show co-localization of bmp <dig> and otx <dig> expression in ino <dig> ko e <dig> -day embryos . to further monitor for defects in the eme, we next measured nodal expression. at e <dig>  nodal is expressed in the eme where it promotes proliferation of the epiblast and differentiates the dve  <cit> . in ino <dig> ko e <dig>  embryos, nodal was normally expressed suggesting that the eme is partially specified . previous reports have shown that over expression of bmp <dig> in the early embryo inhibits dve differentiation  <cit> . to determine if ino <dig> ko embryos have a defective dve, we measured the expression of dve markers cer <dig>  hex <dig>  and lefty <dig>  <cit> . none of these markers is expressed in e <dig>  ino <dig> ko embryos, suggesting that ino <dig> ko embryos do not specify a dve . defects in dve specification could be due to a general defect in the ve because we observed reduced expression of the extraembryonic ve marker hnf4a in ino <dig> ko embryos   <cit> . these results demonstrate that the dve does not form in ino <dig> ko e <dig>  embryos, which could result from expression of the inhibitory molecule bmp <dig> in the eme and general defects in the ve.

both the ve and the dve originate from the pre, which is specified during implantation at e <dig>   <cit> . to determine if defects in the dve result from defects in the pre, we stained ino <dig> ko e <dig>  embryos with the pre markers, lefty <dig> and hex <dig>  from these experiments, we observed equivalent expression of lefty <dig> and hex <dig>  suggesting that the pre of ino <dig> ko embryos are specified at e <dig>  . in addition to the pre, the e <dig>  embryo has an epi that is the precursor to the e <dig>  eme  <cit> . we next determined if the epi is specified by staining for nanog, a marker of the icm and epi. from these experiments we observed equivalent expression of nanog in the epi, suggesting that it is specified in ino <dig> ko embryos .

we next stained e <dig> -day embryos using tunel to determine if defects in development are due to increased apoptosis with ino <dig> ko. from these experiments we observed no increase of tunel positive cells between wild-type and ino <dig> ko embryos, suggesting that the observed defects are not due to increased cell death  and likely are due to reduced cell proliferation.

in combination, these expression studies demonstrate that ino <dig> ko embryos do not gastrulate. defects in mesoderm differentiation coincide with a lack of the ave and its organizer activity, and are not due to increased cell death. the lack of an ave at e <dig>  is due to the inability of ino <dig> ko embryos to specify a dve at e <dig> . the lack of a dve coincides with the abnormal expression of bmp <dig> in the eme, a known negative regulator of dve differentiation  <cit> . defects in the dve are not likely due to defects prior to e <dig>  because both the pre and epi appear to be normal in e <dig>  ino <dig> ko embryos.

ino <dig> represses bmp <dig> expression during embryonic stem cell differentiation
ish experiments suggest that ino <dig> represses bmp <dig> expression during embryoid body differentiation and in the eme of early post-implantation embryos . these results suggest a model where ino <dig> directly represses bmp <dig> expression in the eme. to explore if ino <dig> directly represses bmp <dig>  we used an in vitro model of early embryonic development. the differentiation of escs in monolayer by withdrawal of 2i + lif in the presence of serum is a relevant model of early embryonic development. when escs are grown under these conditions, they differentiate into epi lineages including eme and mesoderm precursors  <cit> . under these conditions, we observe elevated expression of bmp <dig> in ino <dig> ko escs . elevated bmp <dig> expression coincides with repression of dve markers cer <dig>  hex, and lefty <dig>  defects in dve marker expression are not due to general defects in endoderm differentiation because we observed equivalent expression of endoderm markers gata <dig> and gata <dig> . in embryonic tissue lineages bmp <dig> is regulated by two upstream enhancers   <cit> . chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiments showed that ino <dig> is localized to the bmp <dig> promoter, but not the enhancers, when escs are differentiated for six days in serum containing media lacking 2i + lif . under these same conditions, we next used formaldehyde assisted isolation of regulatory elements  to detect differences in open chromatin at the bmp <dig> promoter in ino <dig> ko escs. from these studies, we detected increased open chromatin ~ <dig>  kb upstream of the bmp <dig> transcription start site in ino <dig> ko escs . these changes in chromatin structure at ~ <dig>  kb upstream of bmp <dig> correlated with increased h3k4me <dig> and sp <dig> occupancy . h3k4me <dig> is a well characterized mark of active promoters  <cit> , and sp <dig> is a transcription factor known to activate bmp <dig> expression  <cit> . in combination, these experiments suggest that bmp <dig> is a direct target of ino <dig> chromatin remodeling activity with consequences to sp <dig> binding and bmp <dig> expression. from these studies, we present a model where ino <dig> normally represses bmp <dig> expression in the eme. when ino <dig> is deleted, bmp <dig> expression increases, dve differentiation is repressed, and embryonic development is stopped .fig.  <dig> ino <dig> localizes to bmp <dig> promoter and regulates its expression during embryonic stem cell differentiation. a quantification of bmp <dig>  hex, lefty <dig>  cer <dig>  gata <dig>  and gata <dig> expression by rt-qpcr during esc differentiation in serum containing media without 2i + lif in monolayer . b cartoon showing the bmp <dig> gene, location of upstream enhancers, and immediate downstream convergent gene gm <dig> position of pcr amplicons used in chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiments are shown as black bars labeled 1- <dig>  c localization of ino <dig> to regulatory elements of bmp <dig> by chromatin immunoprecipitation . chip was performed with wild-type and ino <dig> ko esc after differentiation as a monolayer for six days in serum containing media lacking 2i + lif. position of pcr amplicons are shown in panel a . d cartoon showing the bmp <dig> promoter and the location of pcr amplicons used in faire experiments are shown as black bars labeled 1- <dig>  e changes in chromatin structure ~ <dig>  kb upstream of bmp <dig> in ino <dig> ko esc. faire was performed with wild-type and ino <dig> ko esc after differentiation in serum containing media lacking 2i + lif as a monolayer for six days. position of pcr amplicons is shown in panel d . f increased h3k4me <dig> occupancy at bmp <dig> in ino <dig> ko esc. chip was performed with wild-type and ino <dig> ko esc after differentiation as a monolayer for six days in serum containing media lacking 2i + lif. pcr amplicon  <dig> from panel b was used for chip . g increased sp <dig> occupancy at bmp <dig> in ino <dig> ko esc. chip was performed with wild-type and ino <dig> ko esc after differentiation in serum containing media lacking 2i + lif as a monolayer for six days. pcr amplicon  <dig> from panel b was used for chip . h model for ino <dig> function during proximal-distal axis establishment. in wild-type embryos, ino <dig> in part functions in the eme to repress bmp <dig> expression. bmp <dig> repression in the eme promotes dve differentiation. in ino <dig> ko embryos, bmp <dig> is abnormally expressed in the eme, which inhibits dve differentiation. a lack of a dve prevents the ave from forming, which subsequently prevents gastrulation. esc embryonic stem cell, lif leukemia inhibitory factor, faire formaldehyde assisted isolation of regulatory elements, ko knockout, eme embryonic ectoderm, dve distal visceral endoderm, ave anterior visceral endoderm



discussion
in the last few decades it has been discovered that chromatin remodeling complexes are essential for many aspects of mammalian development  <cit> . several chromatin remodeling complexes are essential for pre-implantation development including swi/snf   <cit> , nurd  <cit> , and tip60/p <dig>  <cit>  complexes. in contrast, several other complexes including nurf   <cit>  and chd <dig>  <cit>  have post-implantation phenotypes, suggesting that they regulate specific developmental pathways. similarly, we showed that ino <dig> ko embryos implant, but fail to develop beyond the egg cylinder stage. these findings contrast with the cell essential functions for ino <dig> in differentiated mefs, where it regulates telomere structures and dna replication  <cit> . the viability of ino <dig> ko escs, but not mefs, could be due to differences in telomere structure and dna replication, which are known to occur between the cell types  <cit> .

to understand better how ino <dig> regulates embryonic development, we derived ino <dig> ko escs from pre-implantation embryos. we maintained ino <dig> ko esc under growth conditions that promote either ground state  or metastable pluripotency . previous studies have shown that these culture conditions simulate growth conditions of the e <dig>  blastocyst icm  or e <dig>  epi and pre   <cit> . ino <dig> ko escs remain undifferentiated at ground state pluripotency, but begin to show signs of differentiation in the metastable state, including loss of robust ap staining, and down-regulation of pluripotency markers nanog, oct <dig>  klf <dig>  and esrrb. these results support a model where ino <dig> is not required to maintain the pluripotent e <dig>  blastocyst icm in utero, but rather has essential functions in regulating cellular differentiation of the e <dig>  peri-implantation embryo. our conclusions deviate slightly from previous studies which document that ino <dig> is required to maintain esc pluripotency and pre-implantation development  <cit> . differences in methods used to achieve loss of function could explain these contrasting reports. the use of a sirna kd approach could deplete maternal ino <dig> transcripts, thus revealing pre-implantation phenotypes  <cit> . conversely, a genetic ko approach would leave maternal ino <dig> transcripts intact, mask any pre-implantation phenotypes, and allow the embryo to progress to post-implantation development .

in addition, the discrepancy could arise because ino <dig> is required for oct <dig>  nanog, and sox <dig> expression in the metastable state   <cit> , but not the ground state  . the ability of 2i + lif to mask the self-renewal defects of ino <dig> ko esc is not unprecedented as it has also been reported for mbd <dig> ko esc  <cit> . in the metastable state, fgf4/mapk signaling upregulates pro differentiation transcription factors promoting differentiation  <cit> . it is plausible that depletion of ino <dig>  and the accompanying reduction in oct <dig> expression  <cit> , could synergize with aberrantly expressed pro differentiation factors to promote differentiation in the metastable state. alternatively, increased h3k4me <dig> modified nucleosomes at the promoters of pluripotency regulators in the ground state  <cit>  could recruit a redundant set of activating histone readers, masking the ino <dig> dependency of oct <dig> expression.

to characterize functions for ino <dig> during early embryonic development we performed rna ish of several differentiation markers in peri- and post-implantation embryos. our analysis documents that the dve markers cer <dig>  hex, and lefty <dig> are not expressed in ino <dig> ko e <dig>  embryos. dve establishment involves several smad signaling pathways including those activated by the nodal and bmp <dig> ligands  <cit> . nodal was the first discovered ligand to promote the dve  <cit> , then later it was discovered that bmp <dig> signaling repressed the dve  <cit> . bmp <dig> is normally expressed in the exe, which is proximally located from the distal tip of the embryo, and future site of the dve  <cit> . during egg cylinder expansion , the exe is rapidly moved away from the distal tip of the embryo. during this period, the repressive effects of bmp <dig> on the distal tip of the embryo subside due to the increased distance between the exe and distal tip during egg cylinder expansion  <cit> , and activating nodal signals become dominant due to increased nodal expression in the eme  <cit> . in this model, the combined loss of bmp <dig> signaling and increased nodal signaling to the distal ve, establishes the dve  <cit> . from our studies, we observed that nodal is ino80-independent during embryoid body differentiation and embryonic development. in contrast to nodal, we observe that bmp <dig> is upregulated during embryoid body differentiation and in the e <dig>  eme. the abnormal expression of bmp <dig> in the eme could result in down regulation of dve markers  <cit> . alternatively, defects in the dve could result from general defects in the ve as supported by reduced hnf4a expression with ino <dig> ko, or due to reduction in epiblast proliferation. ino <dig> repression of bmp <dig> expression in the eme could be direct because it localizes to, regulates chromatin structure and transcription factor occupancy at, the bmp <dig> promoter during esc differentiation. in addition to these factors, we observed reduced bmp <dig> expression in the exe, suggesting that ino <dig> could also be an activator of bmp <dig> in extraembryonic tissues. these activities could also be direct, and the study of bmp <dig> expression in differentiating ino <dig> ko trophoblast stem cells could test this hypothesis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
from the data presented in this manuscript, we show that ino <dig> is required to pattern the early embryo. using several models of development, we showed that ino <dig> ko embryos upregulate bmp <dig> expression, and when measurable, we observed a coincident repression of the dve markers cer <dig>  hex, and lefty <dig>  because bmp <dig> represses the dve, we propose that the lack of a dve in ino <dig> ko embryos is in part due to elevated bmp <dig> expression in the eme. ino <dig> functions in regulating bmp <dig> expression are likely direct because we observed specific ino <dig> localization to its promoter in differentiating escs. we also observed evidence that ino <dig> remodels chromatin and regulates sp <dig> binding at the bmp <dig> promoter under these same conditions. these results support a model where ino <dig> directly represses bmp <dig> expression in the eme, and its repression is essential for dve establishment and ultimately a functional p-d axis .
