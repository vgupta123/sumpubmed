BACKGROUND
soil salinization owing to agricultural irrigation leads to crop growth rate reduction and yield decrease. the understanding of the mechanisms by which plants cope with high concentration of salt could enhance productivity in the high saline conditions. excess nacl inhibits plant growth both in shoots and roots
 <cit> . a significant growth reduction in the maize shoot and primary root is observed following nacl treatment
 <cit> . one reason of the growth suppression is inadequate photosynthesis due to stomatal closure and consequently limited carbon dioxide uptake under salt stress
 <cit>  and thus most morphological and transcriptional studies on the effect of excess salinity have been focused on shoots and leaves because they are responsible for photosynthesis. but the effect of this stress on roots should be more obvious as the root is the organ that is directly exposed to the salinity soil
 <cit> . the molecular and cellular mechanism why the growth of young roots was repressed under salt stress is not precisely known.

the plant growth requires concerted water uptake and irreversible cell wall expansion to enlarge cells
 <cit> . the mechanical character of the cell wall controls the cell size and shape through the governance of cell expansion, which determines the morphology of tissues and organs
 <cit> . several studies using transgenic materials have confirmed the role of expansins in promoting cell enlargement by affecting cell wall loosening
 <cit> . the plant cell wall is a dynamic network structure that consists of cellulose microfibrils and helicellulose embedded in a pectin matrix and contains proteins and numerous enzymes
 <cit> . this structure is important in plant growth and development and in response to various environmental stresses
 <cit> . the cell wall related proteins are believed to play a role in modulating cell wall extensibility that mediates cell enlargement and expansion. these proteins include xyloglucan endotransglucosylase , endo- <dig> -b-d-endoglucanase , expansins , and the plasma membrane proton pump 
 <cit> . the low water potential is found to increase xet activity in the apical region of maize roots
 <cit> , although the possible role of xet in cell wall extension could not yet be confirmed in vitro
 <cit> . expansins have been reported to induce immediate cell wall loosening in vitro and in vivo
 <cit> , and may be involved in acid-induced growth through disrupting the link between cellulose microfibrils and adjacent matrix
 <cit> . the expansin gene family that shares conserved motifs comprises four gene subfamilies: α-expansin , β-expansin , expansin-like a, and expansin-like b
 <cit> . the expansin gene expression level is highly related with the elongation growth of roots, internodes and leaves
 <cit> . however, individual expansins are observed to be prior expressed in specific organs, which suggested that individual expansin genes had specific roles for plant development. pm-h+-atpase can pump protons into the apoplast from the cytosol to acidify the apoplast where acidification activates expansin activity that in turn loosens the cell wall and expands cells
 <cit> . xyloglucan is the most common hemicellulose in the primary cell wall in most plants. xet has been proposed as a potential cell wall extension protein because xet is able to cleave and rejoin xyloglucan chains
 <cit> . an up-regulation of the zmxet <dig>  zmexpa <dig>  and zmmha mrnas is found in maize shoots
 <cit> .

the gene expression is influenced by chromatin structure, which is dependent on epigenetic regulation, such as histone post-translational modifications and dna methylation. the basic repeated unit of chromatin is the nucleosome in eukaryotes, which is formed by wrapping approximately 146 bp of dna around a histone octamer that consists of two copies of each histone proteins, h2a, h2b, h <dig> and h4
 <cit> . the n-terminus tail  amino acid residue of the histones, exposed on the surface of the nucleosome, is subjected to post-translational modifications, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination, catalyzed by histone modification enzymes
 <cit> . histone acetyltransferases  are classified into two categories based on their subcellular distribution: the type a hats and the type b hats
 <cit> . histone acetylation is regulated by hats and often correlated with gene activation
 <cit> . histone modification is involved in transcriptional regulation of many genes under salt stress
 <cit> .

an understanding of the growth response of crop roots at cellular and molecular levels to salinity is of fundamental importance for a better comprehension of plant resistance to excess salinity and the breeding of salt stress-adapted crops. the cell wall is thought to be the major control point for cell enlargement, which is related with plant stress response. currently, little is known about whether the histone modification is involved in regulating the expression of the cell wall related genes under salt stress conditions. this study aimed to analyze cell morphological alterations in maize roots as a consequence of excess salt in relation to the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of the cell wall related protein genes. salt stress induced maize growth inhibition along with root swelling and cell enlargement, which were accompanied by an up-regulation in some cell wall related genes. the global histone acetylation levels of h3k <dig> and h4k <dig> were increased in treated seedlings and the transcript levels of the zmhatb and zmgcn <dig> genes were increased, which might be an adaptive response of plants to salt stress. chip results displayed that up-regulation of the zmexpb <dig> and zmxet <dig> genes was associated with an increase in histone h3k <dig> acetylation levels on the promoter regions and coding regions of these two genes in response to salt stress. our data indicated that salt stress-induced elevation of h3k9ac was accompanied by the change of cell well related gene expression, resulting in an adaptive cellular and growth response.

RESULTS
high salinity causes the elongation zone swelling and the meristematic zone shortening
six-day-old maize seedlings were transferred to 1/ <dig> hoagland’s nutrient solution supplemented with different concentrations of nacl and were further grown for 7 days, and the results showed that seedling growth was inhibited as well as the secondary root was reduced obviously in varying degrees . as expected, 250 mm nacl often cause leaves to wither and even die, and thus 200 mm nacl was chosen for this study, also based on the reported result
 <cit> . after exposure to 200 mm nacl, the primary root got shorter, while roots were swollen at the elongation zone and the length of the meristematic zone was decreased. the swelling zone became longer with the increasing of the treatment time as compared with the control group . following 200 mm nacl treatment, the primary root length and the plant height were dramatically reduced and after 96 h the primary root length was decreased by 27%  and the plant height was reduced by 26%  as compared with the control group. next, we wanted to know cellular changes at the swollen region. the transverse sections of the swollen part in the elongation zone of roots  showed that the diameter of roots in this region were increased, accompanied by cortical cell radical enlargement and distortion after stressed with 200 mm nacl for 48 h and 96 h as compared with the control group . in the control group, epidermal and cortical cells were isodiametric and uniformly placed , whereas in the stressed plants the shape and distribution of epidermal and cortical cells were irregular . the size of the cortical cells was slightly increased after treatment with 200 mm nacl for 48 h but greatly increased for 96 h and accompanied by cortical cell radical enlargement. furthermore, the number of cortical cell layers was not changed in the treated seedlings for 48 h and 96 h, but the number of the stele tissue cell layers was increased . the increase of the cortex in the width must have predominantly been due to the cortical cell radical enlargement, which concomitantly caused the root swelling, which might be adaptive responses of plants to high-salinity stress.

we also used root longitudinal sections to analyze effects of nacl on roots. the longitudinal sections of the roots  were observed after 48 h and 96 h of treatment with 200 mm nacl. root growth is a consequence of cell division in the meristematic zone and cell elongation in the elongation zone. according to root morphology and feulgen staining, above the root cap is the meristematic zone  and the elongation zone  is located between the mz and the root hair zone. the diameter of the longitudinal section of the root was increased especially in the elongation zone after 200 mm nacl treatment . after 48 h of treatment with 200 mm nacl, the width of cortex was almost not changed, but the width of the stele tissue was increased . after 96 h of treatment, the width of cortex and stele tissue was dramatically increased . the root cells were vertical alignment with almost uniform size for the cortex and stele tissue in the control group , but messed alignment with totally different size in cortex and stele tissue in the stressed plants . the meristematic zone cells are applanate with a bigger size and aligned in control plants . in contrast, the meristematic zone cells were arranged disorderly with a smaller size but with increased cell numbers after subjected to high-salinity stress . the cell proliferating activity was reduced, which was verified by feulgen staining . root elongation growth is dependent on massive expansion of cells continuously produced by meristematic tissues at the root tip; inhibition of the root growth by salinity is associated with an inhibition of this cell expansion
 <cit> . thus, the reduction of cell division activity and the inhibition of meristematic zone cells to expand to elongation zone cells may cause the inhibition of root growth. after 48 h of treatment, the number of cortical cell layers and the size of the cortical cell were almost not changed, but the number of stele tissue cell layers were increased, which was highlighted by a black rectangular frame, and accompanied by transverse and radial enlargement of the cells emerging in the stele tissue pointed out by an arrow . after 96 h of treatment, the number of cortical cell layers was almost not changed, but the cortical cell radial enlargement was observed, and the total number of cortical cells per column of cells in the elongation zone was decreased compared to the control group . the number of the stele tissue cell layers was increased after treatment which was pointed out by a black rectangular frame, accompanied by transverse and radial enlargement of the cells emerging in stele tissue pointed out by an arrow . this result was consistent with that at 48 h . furthermore, control plants showed well-organized stele tissues with almost horizontal cell division planes in the elongation zone , but the stressed plants exhibited irregular cell-division planes  which might increase the number of stele tissue cell layers.

high salinity activates the expression of hats and increases global histone acetylation levels in the genome
recent studies have demonstrated that histone acetylation of chromatin is involved in plant responses to drought and cold stress
 <cit> . to investigate total dynamic changes in histone acetylation under salt stress in maize roots, we carried out in situ chromatin immunostaining of interphase nuclei prepared at various time points using commercially available antibodies to h3k9ac and h4k5ac. as shown in figure 
4a and figure 
4b, in the control groups the signals in nuclei for the histones h3k <dig>  and h4k <dig>  acetylation were not significantly altered under normal growth conditions, but in contrast, acetylation signal intensity was increased after treatment with 200 mm nacl compared to the control groups, indicating that the acetylation levels of h3k <dig> and h4k <dig> were increased under salt stress. quantification of the signal intensity of mean gray values showed that the h3k9ac and h4k5ac levels were increased by approximately 40% to 60% after 200 mm nacl treatment . we further performed western blot detection of h3k9ac and h4k5ac in the untreated and treated seedlings with 200 mm nacl. the results showed that the h3k <dig>  and h4k <dig>  acetylation levels under normal growth conditions were not significantly altered at the indicated times, but salt stress induced an increase in global acetylation of h3k <dig>  and h4k <dig>  as the duration of exposure was increased . it is known that histone acetylation is catalyzed by hats
 <cit> . thus we analyzed hat expression pattern in maize roots treated with and without 200 mm nacl using rt-pcr. two hat genes  were selected from two types of hats . using quantitative real-time pcr after reverse transcription of rna, we found that mrna levels of the zmhatb and zmgcn <dig> genes were increased from  <dig> to 96 h in response to salt treatment . in untreated seedlings, the mrna levels of the zmhatb and zmgcn <dig> genes were almost not increased during growth process. by comparison, the transcript level of zmhatb  reached the maximal value at 96 h which was  <dig> , while the transcript level of zmgcn <dig>  reached the maximal value at 4 h which was  <dig> .

high salinity selectively affects the expression of the cell-wall related genes
growth is a process of an increase in cell numbers and cell volumes. the cell enlargement is accomplished by simultaneous vacuolar enlargement and irreversible cell wall expansion
 <cit> . expansins are proteins involved in cell wall loosening
 <cit> . xet has been proposed as a potential protein for cell wall extension
 <cit> . the plasma-membrane proton pump  can pump protons from the cytosol into the apoplast, resulting in cell wall loosening and cell expansion
 <cit> . the above anatomy experiment showed that roots were swollen due to cell radial enlargement in the elongation zone after high salinity treatment, so we wanted to know whether the expression of these cell wall related genes was affected. to further analyze the temporal expression patterns of these genes, time course analysis by rt-pcr was performed. six-day-old maize seedlings were exposed to 200 mm nacl, and maize root samples were harvested after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 96 h for rna isolation. the mrna levels of the tested genes were normalized with respect to the level of the beta actin gene, whose transcription level was stable in maize under salt stress
 <cit> . previous work identified four expansin genes highly expressed in the maize roots, namely the two α-expansins, expa <dig> and expa <dig>  and two β-expansins, expb <dig> and expb <dig> <cit> . the expression pattern of zmexpa <dig> is not consistent with that of zmexpa <dig>  and zmexpa <dig> has a role in wall loosening for shoot cell elongation under salt stress
 <cit> . expb <dig> is a gene particularly expressed in pollen, and as one of the group- <dig> allergens, has a wall-loosening role, aiding penetration of the pollen tube through the stigma and style by softening the maternal cell walls
 <cit> . so we analyzed the expression of three α-expansin genes, zmexpa <dig>  zmexpa <dig> and zmexpa <dig>  three β-expansin genes, zmexpb <dig>  zmexpb <dig> and zmexpb <dig>  and the zmxet <dig> and zmmha genes in maize roots. our data showed that the transcript levels of zmexpa <dig>  zmexpa <dig>  zmexpa <dig>  zmexpb <dig>  zmexpb <dig> and zmxet <dig> were remarkably increased from  <dig> to 96 h after exposure to high-salinity treatment . the zmexpa <dig>  zmexpa <dig>  zmexpa <dig>  zmexpb <dig> and zmexpb <dig> mrna levels began to substantially accumulate after 2 h of salt stress , and the zmexpa <dig>  zmexpa <dig> and zmexpb <dig> mrna levels  were substantially and steadily increased from 2 h to 96 h after the treatment, while zmexpa <dig>  was substantially increased from 2 h to 24 h after the treatment but slightly increased from 48 h to 96 h. the zmexpb <dig>  were substantially increased at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  96 h and slightly increased at  <dig>  48 h but decreased at 24 h. the zmxet <dig> transcript level  was substantially increased from 4 h to 48 h after salt stress but slightly increased at 2 h and 96 h, which was 40-fold higher than untreated seedlings at 4 h. in contrast, zmexpb <dig> and zmmha mrna levels were decreased from  <dig> to 96 h after the treatment .

the local h3k9ac levels of zmexpb <dig> and zmxet <dig> were increased under high-salinity stress
the transcript levels of zmexpb <dig> and zmxet <dig> were increased after treatment with 200 mm nacl for 48 h. it is generally accepted that histone acetylation is generally associated with gene transcription
 <cit> . to determine whether the change of the transcript levels of zmexpb <dig> and zmxet <dig> at 48 h under salt stress was due to the alteration of histone modifications, we performed chip experiments using an antibody against at histone h <dig> acetylated at k <dig>  on the maize roots untreated and treated with 200 mm nacl for 48 h. four different regions of the zmexpb <dig> and zmxet <dig> genes were selected to conduct chip experiments . for zmexpb <dig> gene, the acetylation levels were substantially increased on promoter regions a and c, and slightly increased on the promoter region b and the coding region d . for zmxet <dig> gene, the acetylation levels were substantially increased on the promoter region b and the coding regions c and d, and slightly increased on the promoter region a .

discussion
high salinity inhibited root growth and resulted in cell enlargement and root swelling
a high concentration of nacl reduced root growth in many crop plants
 <cit> . in this study, 200 mm nacl treatment caused maize growth inhibition, and the primary root length was significantly reduced. this was consistent with previous observations in maize and cotton seedling roots
 <cit> . the swelling elongation zone became wider and longer and the meristematic zone was reduced in length with the increasing of the treatment time with 200 mm nacl . root swelling was also observed in maize roots exposed to salt stress
 <cit>  and aluminium stress
 <cit> . the formation of tuberized roots also has been reported in a.thaliana to be a consequence of drought stress
 <cit>  and salt stress
 <cit> . it has been reported the length of the meristematic zone of the primary root tips was reduced by 56% after 1 week of 1% nacl treatment in a.thaliana. our cytological analysis showed that the cortical cell radical enlargement after 200 mm nacl treatment resulted in an increase in the root diameter. similarly, a significant decline in the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the stele to area of the root was observed with increasing nacl concentration in cotton roots
 <cit> . it has been reported that a radical swelling of all cell layers in root tips of arabidopsis thaliana after 2 weeks of 1% nacl stress
 <cit> . the length and volume of the cortical cells were increased, but the cell density in the cortex was significantly decreased, indicating that the cell production was decreased during salt stress. it has been reported that in cotton roots salinity diminished the rate of cell production
 <cit> . burssens et al.
 <cit>  reported that the inhibition of a.thaliana root growth with salt stress is at least partially due to a decrease of cell production. the stele tissue cells transport water and soluble mineral nutrients from the roots to shoots. the transverse and radical enlargement of stele tissue cells was first emerged on the longitudinal section and the number of stele tissue cell layers was increased both in the transverse section and longitudinal section of the roots. these may help cells uptake more water and create more barrier to reduce na+ concentration, which may be an adaptive mechanism to defense ionic toxicity. a decrease in the meristematic zone length of the primary root and the elongation zone cell numbers may be the reasons why the root growth was inhibited.

high salinity induced cell enlargement and root swelling in the elongation zone are accompanied by up-regulation of some cell wall related genes
the expression levels of expansin genes were increased in response to submergence in deepwater rice internode
 <cit> . the gmexp <dig> expression level was very high in soybean roots where rapid root elongation took place and ectopic expression of gmexp <dig> accelerated the growth of transgenic tobacco roots, which showed insensitivity to stress
 <cit> . excised stem segments treated with auxin rapidly increased cell elongation, and the mrnas of expa <dig>  expa <dig>  expa <dig> and expa <dig> were increased within 1 h
 <cit> . expb <dig> plays a role in the elongation of maize roots, and may be also involved in plant responses to environmental stimuli
 <cit> . it has been reported that the expression of exp <dig>  exp <dig>  exp <dig> and exp <dig> genes was up-regulated in maize primary roots after grown at low ψw, which likely contributed to enhanced cell wall extensibility and thus helped root cells maintain elongation at reduced turgor pressure
 <cit> . the expression of xet and expansins was about 100-fold higher in cotton fiber cells, corresponding to their proposed role in cell enlargement
 <cit> . the transcription levels of expansins and xet were increased after salt stress
 <cit> . the xet activity was enhanced in the apical region of maize roots from plants grown under low water potentials, and was suggested to be necessary for maintaining elongation
 <cit> . our rt-pcr experiment showed that the transcript levels of zmexpa <dig>  zmexpa <dig>  zmexpa <dig>  zmexpb <dig>  zmexpb <dig> and zmxet <dig> were increased from  <dig> to 96 h after exposure to high-salinity treatment. we presumed that the up-regulation of these five expansin genes and zmxet <dig> was an adaptive mechanism to regulate the transverse and radical enlargement of the elongation zone cells, which may mitigate the decrease in root growth and the damage under high-salinity stress. it has been reported that the average cell length of mesocotyls was increased by up to 58% in the transgenic lines that overexpressed osexp <dig> <cit> . the zmexpb <dig> gene was down-regulated after treatment with 200 mm nacl. hormone treatment induced expression of exp <dig> but repressed that of expb <dig> in maize roots
 <cit> . therefore the differential expression patterns of expansins suggest that each expansin member may play a specific role in root growth and development, and in response to external stimuli. the acid growth theory thought that an auxin-induced acidic environment was needed for elongation growth
 <cit> . pm-h+-atpase can pump protons into the apoplast from the cytosol to create a acidic environment and thus the down-regulation of zmmha may reduce root elongation growth.

histone acetylation may be involved in high salinity-induced gene expression regulation
recent studies have revealed that gene expression is regulated by dynamic histone modification, which could be an important mechanism for plants to adapt to abiotic stress
 <cit> . in tobacco by <dig> and arabidopsis t <dig> cells, high-salinity and cold stress triggered rapid up-regulation of histone h <dig> ser- <dig> phosphorylation and histone h <dig> acetylation that was correlated with activation of stress-responsive genes
 <cit> . the mutations of gcn <dig> and ada <dig> that encode the components of histone acetyltransferase complexes affected the expression of the cold stress-responsive genes in arabidopsis <cit> . the enrichment of h3k <dig> acetylation and h3k <dig> trimethylation was related with the up-regulation of rd29a, rd29b, rd <dig>  and rap <dig>  genes in response to drought treatment
 <cit> . similarly, salt stress enriched h3k9k <dig> acetylation and h3k <dig> trimethylation on the promoter and coding regions of dreb2a, rd29a, and rd29b <cit> . our results showed that the total acetylation levels of h3k <dig> and h4k <dig> in the genome were increased after treatment with 200 mm nacl and this increase could be associated with the enhanced expression of zmhatb and zmgcn <dig>  therefore overall histone acetylation level change is likely to be an adaptive response to salt stress at the epigenetic levels. it has been reported that the overall acetylation level alteration may be related with basal transcription and help rapid restoration of the acetylation level when the recruited hat is removed
 <cit> . our results diaplayed salt stress caused the up-regulation of zmexpb <dig> and zmxet <dig> genes, which was accompanied with the elevated h3k <dig> acetylation levels on promoter regions and coding regions of these two genes. these data support the conclusion that epigenetic regulation plays a vital role in rapid regulation of gene expression in plant adaptive response to environmental stimuli
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that the stele tissue and cortex cells were enlarged after treatment with 200 mm nacl, which was associated with an up-regulation of cell wall related genes zmexpa <dig>  zmexpa <dig>  zmexpa <dig>  zmexpb <dig>  zmexpb <dig> and zmxet <dig>  the expression of histone acetyltransferase genes zmhatb and zmgcn <dig> was increased accompanied by an increase in the global acetylation levels of histones h3k <dig> and h4k <dig>  suggesting that epigenetic regulation was involved in salt stress response. chip experiment further indicated that the up-regulation of zmexpb <dig> and zmxet <dig> genes was associated with the elevated h3k <dig> acetylation levels on promoter regions and coding regions of these two genes. these data imply that an epigenetic control of the expression of the cell wall related genes in response to salt stress results in cell enlargement and root swelling which is an adaptive response.
