BACKGROUND
cataract development is the leading cause of defective vision in humans, and cataracts can be classified as either congenital or age-related. congenital cataracts account for 10% of cases of childhood blindness, half of which have a genetic cause. more than  <dig> genes have been implicated in human cataractogenesis  <cit> , and these can be divided into two clusters according to the stage of lens development at which they are involved. the first group of genes, including pax <dig>  six <dig>  rx, sox <dig>  pitx <dig> and maf, consists of transcription factors at the top of the hierarchy of lens development that are required for the early stages of lens development  <cit> . mutations in these genes prevent correct formation of the primary lens fibers, leading to most severe lens defect phenotypes. the second group contains genes that determine lens structure and genes related to structure, including the crystallins, bfsp, mip, and the connexins  <cit> . most of the genes identified as causing congenital cataracts fall into the second category. the relationship between transcription factors and lens structural genes warrants further study.

hsf <dig>  hsf <dig>  and hsf <dig> are members of the heat-shock transcription factor  family. only hsf <dig> lacks the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic repeat  that inhibits the formation of active trimers, suggesting a unique functional property  <cit> . earlier, we found that mutations in hsf <dig> cause autosomal dominant lamellar and marner cataracts, suggesting a new pathway for cataract formation  <cit>  i, 1997; tanabe,  <dig>  two years later, smaoui et al. reported that the mutation in intron  <dig> that causes the exon  <dig> splicing shift is associated with autosomal recessive total cataracts  <cit> . fujimoto et al. and min et al. reported that disruption of the hsf <dig> gene caused lens defects in mice, indicating a requirement for hsf <dig> in fiber cell differentiation during lens development  <cit> .

neither the relationship between hsf <dig> and crystallins nor the detailed mechanism of the maintenance of lens transparency by hsf <dig> is fully understood. we used an hsf <dig> knockout mouse model and a human epithelial cell line to analyze the changes in lens components. our results indicate that hsf <dig> regulates a comprehensive array of lens structural proteins. it has a unique role in the development of the lens at the late embryonic and postnatal stages of mouse development; specifically, disruption of the hsf <dig> gene leads to cataracts via multiple pathways.

RESULTS
the hsf4-/- mouse exhibits aberrant fiber development in the pericentric region of the lens, partially mimicking human hsf <dig> mutation cataracts
in order to examine the function of hsf <dig> in lens formation in detail, we generated targeted disruption of the mouse hsf <dig> gene by homologous recombination of 129s <dig> embryonic stem  cells. in the vector, exons 3– <dig>  which encode the dna-binding domain, were replaced with the neomycin-resistance gene followed by the pgk cassette . the es cells  were electroporated with the linearized targeting vector under positive-negative selection  <cit> , and eight correctly targeting clones were obtained . es cells with correctly targeting clones were injected into a c57bl/ <dig> blastocyst ; the genotypes of the offspring were analyzed by pcr to identify wild-type , heterozygous , and homozygous  varieties . as expected, the ratio of phenotypes was in accordance with mendelian frequency. hsf4-/- mice are largely normal across all developmental stages except for cataract formation. under slit-lamp detection, we observed a cataract phenotype in the hsf <dig> knockout mouse . opacity of the lens of the hsf4-/- mouse appeared at an early postnatal stage and increased with age.

the structure of the hsf4-/- lens fibers became loose, and a vacuole-like cavity that appeared in lens fiber cells at day e <dig>   became severe compared to wild-type; undegraded nuclei were clearly seen under a light microscope. however, the bow region of the lens, where the lens epithelial cells differentiate into fibers, was generally normal . sem images revealed loose fibers in the lenses of hsf <dig> knockout mice that showed much less interaction than those of their wild-type counterparts .

hsf <dig> has a crucial role in the expression of γ-crystallins, notably γs-crystallin, during postnatal maturation of the lens
the hsf4-/- mouse lens is fragile and much lighter, but of a similar size, compared with its wild-type counterpart . more than 90% of lens proteins are in the soluble form and include a variety of crystallins; in mammals, the crystallins are αa and αb; βb <dig>  βb <dig>  βb <dig>  βa3/a <dig>  and βa4; γa, γb, γc, γd, γe, γf, and γs. in mice, the γ-crystallins are the major contributor to the weight of the mature lens proteins. in humans, β-crystallins and γ-crystallins are in almost equal proportions, with a slightly lower amount of α-crystallins. fujimoto et al. detected markedly reduced expression of γ-crystallin genes in adult hsf4-null mice, even at  <dig> days old, but the expression levels of γ-crystallin genes were normal in the lens of e <dig>  hsf4-null embryos. they used chromatin ip  analysis to show that hsf <dig> binds upstream of the γf-crystallin gene, suggesting that hsf <dig> regulates expression of the γf-crystallin genes  <cit> . in contrast, min et al. did not observe a significant reduction of γ-crystallin genes in 1-day-old to 28-day-old hsf4-null mice, except the γf-crystallin gene, which showed reduced expression in 10-day-old hsf4-null mice compared to wildtype mice  <cit> . these conflicting results may be due to differences in hsf4-null mice construction, differences in the genetic background of the mice being tested, and other unknown factors. however, neither min et al. nor fujimoto et al. studied another important crystallin protein, γs-crystallin. during maturation of the mouse lens, the level of γs-crystallin increases fivefold, replacing other types of crystallins and accounting for up to 15% of the total weight  <cit> . this finding prompted us to examine the expression of γ-crystallins  in the lens of knockout and wild-type mice. we quantified the mrna expression of γ-crystallins and assayed the transcriptional activity of hsf <dig>  we found that hsf4-/- mice have reduced expression levels of all subtypes of γ-crystallins directly after birth compared with wild-type mice, and there was almost a complete lack of γ-crystallin expression at  <dig> weeks old. in wild-type mice, the level of γs-crystallin mrna indicates that γs-crystallin is only a small proportion of total γ-crystallin at birth, and the level increases to make it the major γ-crystallin at  <dig> weeks old . the hsf <dig> and γs-crystallin genes are first expressed at the late embryonic stages and are up-regulated in late embryonic development  <cit> . the γcrystallin genes are located in a gene cluster and are regulated by sox <dig> and maf, but the regulation of γs-crystallin gene  has not been well characterized  <cit> . to further evaluate the role of hsf <dig> in the regulation of γs-crystallin expression, we analyzed the expression of γs-crystallin mrna in the human lens epithelial cell line sra01/ <dig> under conditions of hhsf4b overexpression  <cit> . the γs-crystallin mrna expression level was tenfold higher in hhsf4b-overexpressing cells than in the control . as the γs-crystallin promoter region contains a heat-shock element  that is less conserved than in the promoters of γ-crystallin , we asked whether hsf4b can interact directly with the endogenous promoter of crygs to regulate its expression. we used chip assays to test this hypothesis. the immunoprecipitation of solubilized chromatin prepared from hsf4b-expressing sra01/ <dig> cells with an anti-hsf4b antibody was followed by pcr using primers that target the potential hsf4b-binding site in the crygs promoter region. pcr yielded the expected band in the cells expressing hsf4b, and no band for the normal goat igg control . additionally, we assumed that hsf4b would bind crygs-hse to activate γs-crystallin transcription. under this assumption, the crygs-luc vector, which contains an upstream sequence of the γs-crystallin gene, was constructed, and luciferase activity levels with and without overexpression of hsf4b were determined in the sra01/ <dig> cell line. the relative luciferase activity with overexpression of hsf4b was about sixfold greater than that of the system without overexpression. the dominant-negative hsf4b, which had lost the dna-binding domain of hsf4b, had no significant effect on luciferase activity . these results indicate that hsf4b could regulate the expression of γs-crystallin by binding to crygs-hse.

the γs-crystallin mutant rncat is a recessive cataract mouse model with a g to a transition point mutation at position  <dig> in exon  <dig> of the γs-crystallin gene  <cit> . in heterozygous rncat mice, the lens is nearly normal. our results suggested that hsf <dig> regulates the expression of the γs-crystallin gene . if this is true, lack of hsf <dig> would decrease the production of the wild-type γs-crystallin and might facilitate the cataract development. as reference, lens opacity of the rncat mouse appeared at  <dig> days old in the nuclear region  <cit> . interestingly, when we intercrossed the hsf4-/- mouse with the rncat mouse, the offspring  developed cataract in the posterior part of the lens, whereas the lenses of the hsf4+/+/rncat/+ mice remained basically clear . the cataract in double null hsf4-/-/rncat/rncat mice developed earlier, appearing at  <dig> days old, and seemed more severe than that in hsf4+/+/rncat/rncat mice . lack of hsf <dig> worsens the lens fiber defect in γs-crystallin mutation mouse rncat . the mrna levels of γs-crystallin in the hsf4-/-/rncat/+ and hsf4-/-/rncat/rncat mice were reduced by more than 90% compared with the hsf4+/+ and rncat/rncat mice . to certain degree, our results further suggest that hsf <dig> disruption reduces crygs expression along with the cataract formation in the offsprings in such intercross.

intermediate filament genes  are down-regulated in the lens of the hsf4-/- mouse
an important aspect of hsf4-/- cataract formation is the abnormal development of lens fibers that cannot be explained completely by crystallin regulation. the loose fiber structure of the lens of the hsf <dig> knockout mouse is similar to that of the bfsp1/ <dig> knockout mouse. knockout of bfsp <dig> or bfsp <dig> resulted in a loose fiber structure with fewer connection proteins among the fibers  <cit> . therefore, we quantified the levels of bfsp <dig> and bfsp <dig> mrna in the lens of hsf <dig> knockout mice. at birth, the level of bfsp <dig> mrna in hsf <dig> knockout mice was half that of wild-type mice, whereas the level of bfsp <dig> mrna was similar to that of wild-type mice. at  <dig> weeks old, the levels of both bfsp <dig> and bfsp <dig> mrna in the lens of hsf <dig> knockout mice were reduced by more than sevenfold compared with wild-type mice, except for the level of bfsp <dig> mrna at birth . it has been suggested that the 129s <dig> strain mouse has a deletion that causes the loss of exon  <dig> from bfsp <dig> mrna and dramatically reduces mrna levels of bfsp <dig>  the bfsp <dig> protein in this strain was undetectable by antisera to the wild-type protein  <cit> . since we obtained the expected pcr product size from hsf4-/- mice using primers from the deletion region of the bfsp <dig> gene , there is at least one copy of the c57bl/6j bfsp <dig> allele in the hsf4-/- mouse. although hsf4-/- mice carry at least one copy of the highly expressed c57bl/6j bfsp <dig> allele, hsf4-/- mice had a much lower level of expression of bfsp <dig> compared to the 129s <dig> wild-type mice. therefore, lack of hsf <dig> results in reduced expression of bfsp <dig> 

overexpression of hhsf4b in sra01/ <dig> cells up-regulated transcription of bfsp <dig> and bfsp <dig>  and this up-regulation could be inhibited specifically by short hairpin rna  targeting hsf4b . as both bfsp <dig> and bfsp <dig> promoters have the less-conserved hse sequence , we asked whether hsf <dig> can directly bind the promoter region of bfsp <dig> and bfsp <dig>  we used chip assays and detected the expected bands of the promoter sequences of the bfsp <dig> and bfsp <dig> genes in cells expressing hsf4b . this result suggests that hsf <dig> can bind to the promoter regions of the bfsp <dig> and bfsp <dig> genes. we then used the dual-luciferase system to assess whether hsf <dig> activates the expression of bfsp <dig> and bfsp <dig>  human bfsp1-luc or bfsp2-luc vectors were co-transfected with or without hsf4b into sra01/ <dig> cells. the relative luciferase activities of hsf4b co-transfected with bfsp1-luc or bfsp2-luc were approximately eightfold that of cells transfected with bfsp1-luc or bfsp2-luc alone . these results indicate that hsf <dig> may bind specifically to the bfsp1-hse/bfsp2-hse sequences and regulate expression of the intermediate filament proteins bfsp <dig> and bfsp <dig> 

the 2d electrophoretic analysis of hsf4-/- lens components
to analyze changes in the lens components of hsf4-/- mice, we used 2d electrophoretic  analysis to generate maps of lens lysates from 8-week-old hsf4-/- and wild-type  mice, and identified selected spots using liquid chromatography  with tandem mass spectrometry . by comparison with published 2d-e maps of the mouse lens  <cit> , it was possible to identify most of the crystallin proteins in the 2d-e maps of both hsf4-/- and wild-type mice. the lens of hsf4-/- and wild-type mice generally had similar 2d-e protein expression patterns with silver staining. however, alterations of some spots were observed in the 2d-e map of the hsf4-/- lens, which generally had less crystallin protein than the wild-type lens . we selected and identified some altered spots in the lens map of hsf4-/- mice, where signals were either absent or weaker than in wild-type mice . interestingly,  <dig> of  <dig> spots were identified by ms as αa-crystallin. these αa-crystallin molecules had a molecular mass of 15– <dig> kda and migrated to the acidic region  of the 2d-e gel. other differentially expressed spots were identified as αb-crystallin, βa1-crystallin, βb2-crystallin, γc-crystallin, γb-crystallin, heat shock protein  <dig>  and  <dig> unknown proteins. due to the limited amount of sample, the terminal sequences of selected spots were not characterized. a similar pattern has been reported during aging or cataractogenesis in mice  <cit> . truncation of αa-crystallin is probably caused by the activation of a class of calcium-activated proteases known as calpains, such as lp <dig> or calpain <dig>  <cit> , which have 'clipping' activity in vitro. we used real-time pcr to determine the levels of lp <dig> and calpain <dig> mrnas in the lens of hsf <dig> knockout mice and of wild-type mice. the mrna levels of lp <dig> and calpain <dig> in hsf <dig> knockout neonatal mice were reduced fourfold compared with wild-type mice; this reduction was even greater in 8-week-old mice . therefore, loss of αa-crystallin and reduced expression of lp <dig> and calpain <dig> may be correlated with hsf <dig> disruption.

discussion
the hsf <dig> protein is a member of the heat-shock transcription factor family. recently, there have been two reports that disruption of the hsf <dig> gene generated a lens defect, indicating that hsf <dig> is important for lens cell differentiation  <cit> , but the molecular mechanism needs further study. to this end, we generated a hsf4-/- mouse model and analyzed the lens components by molecular biological and biochemical approaches. the roles of γs-crystallin and the lens intermediate filaments bfsp <dig> and bfsp <dig> in cataract formation in the hsf4-/- mouse were investigated.

crystallins are a large protein family  that contains the main lens components. some crystallins are heat-shock proteins, and most crystallin genes contain an hse motif, which can specifically be bound by hsf <dig> in the lens  <cit> ; therefore, down-regulation of crystallins in the lens of the hsf4-/- mouse was expected. however, the levels of the main αa-crystallin components and some β-crystallin components were not significantly altered in the lens of the hsf4-/- mouse at either the mrna or the protein level  <cit> . this paradox probably reflects the modulation of crystallins by multiple transcription factors at different stages. hsf4-/- abrogated the expression of γ-crystallins in the lens of mice in the late embryonic stage and postnatally, indicating a time point at which hsf <dig> functions more independently. in particular, the expression of γs-crystallin seems to be contemporaneous with the postnatal expression of hsf <dig>  <cit> , whereas the weight percentages of γ-crystallins maintain the same relative distribution throughout development of the mouse lens  <cit> . as expression of γs-crystallin is up-regulated such that it accounts for 15% of the total weight of crystallin protein during lens maturation, the down-regulation of γs-crystallin could be one of the main events caused by hsf <dig> gene disruption. the role of hsf <dig> is crucial and cannot be replaced under normal circumstances. cataract development could therefore be considered a disease state in which there is altered interaction among lens proteins, leading finally to the insolubility of these proteins. in humans, hsf <dig> germline mutations were reported to be associated with recessive adult-onset pulverulent cataract  <cit>  and lamellar cataract that appear late in adult life  <cit> . the data indicate that hsf <dig> plays a critical role in age-related cataract formation. the diversity of phenotypes indicates that the hsf <dig> mutation family might be involved directly in the development of a background context-dependent cataract.

another important aspect of hsf4-/- cataract formation is the abnormal development of lens fibers. the development of lens fibers involves multiple cellular processes, including differentiation of lens epithelial cells and fiber cell maturation. the lens of the hsf4-/- mouse exhibited an abnormal, loose fiber structure. it has been reported that hsf <dig> suppresses the expression of fibroblast growth factor genes which regulate growth and differentiation of lens epithelial cells  <cit> . a high level of transparency and refraction of the lens is also due to the 'short-range' order between highly concentrated crystallins  <cit> . therefore, cataracts can result from changes in protein interactions that are essential for the structure of crystallins. the critical role of protein interactions can be attributed mainly to the lens intermediate filaments bfsp <dig>  and bfsp <dig>  these two genes are expressed exclusively in lens fiber cells and can be used as markers of differentiation  <cit> . the lens fiber structure of the hsf <dig> knockout mouse is similar to that of bfsp <dig> or bfsp <dig> knockout mice  <cit> , suggesting that cataract formation probably involves lens intermediate filament deficiency. however, there are also some definite differences, including the looser fiber structure and lack of cellular degeneration in the fiber layers in bfsp1/ <dig> knockout mice. these are apparent in bfsp1/ <dig> knockout mice, strongly suggesting that hsf <dig> acts through an additional pathway. the short deletion of the bfsp <dig> gene in the  <dig> strain  <cit>  did not weaken our results; in fact, it enhanced the function of hsf <dig>  our q-pcr analysis revealed that expression of the intermediate filaments bfsp <dig> and bfsp <dig> is down-regulated in the lens of the hsf4-/- mouse. using dual-luciferase analysis, we further identified these two genes as possible direct targets for regulation by hsf <dig>  down-regulation of lens intermediate filament proteins caused by lack of hsf <dig> could be an important aspect of abnormal differentiation and continued fiber cell maturation. high levels of transparency and refraction of the lens are due to the short-range order among highly concentrated crystallins  <cit> . the critical role of this protein interaction is attributed mainly to the lens intermediate filament proteins bfsp <dig> and bfsp <dig>  the bfsp <dig> mutation is associated with cataract, suggesting it has an important role in formation of the lens fiber  <cit> . these proteins have been proposed to function in the assembly and connection of crystallins  <cit> . these proteins form a thin filament backbone that is decorated at regular intervals among mature fibers. bfsp <dig> and bfsp <dig> are the main components of this backbone  <cit> .

over a lifetime, lens crystallins undergo a wide variety of irreversible and covalent modifications by processes such as proteolysis, deamidation, and oxidation. these post-translational modifications are often considered the cause of changes in protein interactions, resulting in reduced solubility of crystallins in the aging lens  <cit> . we characterized the expression of hsf4-/- lens proteins using 2d-e and subsequent ms. these modifications were attributed to activation of a class of calcium-activated proteases called calpains, including lp <dig> and calpain <dig>  lp <dig> co-localizes with crystallins in the lens fiber cell cytoplasm and may be important for the truncation that occurs during lens maturation and for maintenance of crystallin architecture. calpain <dig> is more likely to be involved in cell-signalling pathways, as suggested by its localization in the epithelium and peripheral fibers of the lens  <cit> . we observed that expression of lp <dig> and calpain <dig> is reduced during lens development in the hsf <dig> knockout mouse. this potentially indicates a novel role for hsf <dig> in lens development.

CONCLUSIONS
we have determined a high hierarchical position for hsf <dig> in the regulation of lens formation, and we have assessed its unique, important regulatory effects during the later stages of lens maturation. this regulation is active specifically in the formation of delicate fiber structures that eventually contribute to lens development and the maintenance of transparency. maintaining the delicate microscopic structure and transparency in a systematic manner, the lens can be considered to be constructed of crystallins connected by intermediate filament proteins and shaped by lens proteolysis systems in the hsf <dig> regulatory system.
