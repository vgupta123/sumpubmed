BACKGROUND
tripeptide glutathione  is the most abundant non-protein thiol compound of the most living organisms that protects cells from nutritional, environmental and oxidative stresses  <cit> . more than 90% of microbial, plant and mammalian cell glutathione is present in the reduced form, designated as gsh  <cit> . both thiol gsh and disulfide form of oxidized glutathione, gssg, are widely used in medicine and cosmetic industry, as well as food additives  <cit> . as an active ingredient of food, drugs and cosmetic products, gsh could alleviate harmful oxidative processes, scavenge toxic compounds at different kinds of human intoxications and strengthen whitening, skin repair anti-aging effect. oxidized form of glutathione, gssg, could be used as cryoprotector, immunomodulator etc.  <cit> . thus, production of glutathione has great commercial importance.

in spite of the expanding commercial demand for glutathione, its application is restricted due to the high production costs. gsh and gssg could be produced by enzymatic methods  and by fermentation using natural or engineering microorganisms   <cit> . as a rule, microbial gsh overproduction is limited by mechanisms of feedback inhibition by gsh of the activity of the first and rate-limiting enzyme of gsh biosynthesis, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase  as well as gsh-exerted repression of the structural genes coding for gcs  <cit> . thus, the search and/or construction of new and efficient glutathione producers as well as optimization of conditions of glutathione biosynthesis would assist in its bringing to market for the improvement of quality of food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products.

during the last decades the methylotrophic yeast hansenula polymorpha from three genetic lines, dl- <dig>  cbs <dig>  ncyc <dig>  have gained increasing interest, both for basic research and biotechnological applications, which include studying the mechanisms of thermotolerance, peroxisome homeostasis, production of numerous heterologous proteins and high-temperature alcoholic fermentation  <cit> . the industrial relevance of h. polymorpha is mostly explained by several technologically interesting features. this yeast grows to very high cell densities in bioreactors, possesses strong regulatory and constitutive promoters and consequently gives high product yields. like s. cerevisiae, h. polymorpha is characterized by simple cultivation mode in inexpensive growth media, well established genetic tools and experience on industrial cultivation and scaling-up. h. polymorpha is considered as gras organism, it does not harbour pyrogens, pathogens or viral inclusions. in addition, completed genome sequencing  <cit> , established proteome and transcriptome databases  <cit>  makes h. polymorpha suitable organism for metabolic engineering in order to modify and improve particular biosynthetic pathways  <cit> .

h. polymorpha is regarded as a rich source of glutathione, due to the role of this tripeptide in detoxifications of key intermediates of methanol metabolism, formaldehyde, as well as hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides, which are accumulated during methylotrophic growth  <cit> .

in our previous study, we estimated physiological role of some h. polymorpha genes involved in gsh homeostasis: h. polymorpha gsh <dig> gene, hpgsh <dig>  a homologue of s. cerevisiae gsh <dig> gene coding for gcs,  <cit> ; h. polymorpha ggt <dig> gene, homologue of s. cerevisiae cis2/ecm <dig> gene encoding for gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase  <cit> ; h. polymorpha met <dig> gene, hpmet <dig>  similarly to s. cerevisiae met <dig> gene involved in global sulfur regulation  <cit> . we identified gsh as the sole cadmium ion chelator in h. polymorpha  <cit> . meantime, until now, biotechnological potential of h. polymorpha in production of glutathione was not elucidated. in the present study, we studied glutathione producing capacity of h. polymorpha dl- <dig> wild-type strain and several recombinant strains with overexpression of the first gene in glutathione synthesis hpgsh <dig>  depending on parameters of cultivation , carbon substrate  and type of overexpressed genes of gsh biosynthesis in recombinant strains during batch and fed-batch fermentations. under optimized conditions of glucose fed-batch cultivation, engineered strains accumulated more than  <dig> mg of total intracellular glutathione  or gsh+gssgin, per liter of culture medium, which slightly exceeds the known before maximal glutathione production in s. cerevisiae of  <dig> mg/l   <cit> . one of constructed by us h. polymorpha recombinant strains was promising producer of the extracellular glutathione in methanol medium as accumulated 5-times higher titer of total extracellular glutathione  or gsh+gssgex, as compared to best level achieved before for yeasts  <cit> .

RESULTS
growth and glutathione production of h. polymorpha dl- <dig> wild-type strain cultivated in fermenter batch cultures with glucose at different modes of ph control and aeration
to choose the most glutathione productive strain for further work, we compared intra- and extracellular gsh+gssg levels  in h. polymorpha wild-type strains dl-1l, cbs4732l and ncyc495l from three genetic lines   <cit>  using simple enzyme assay that does not differentiate reduced and oxidized forms of glutathione, as both have biotechnological application.

so, the strains of h. polymorpha derived from the genetic line dl- <dig> with the highest levels of gsh+gssgin  as well as gsh+gssgex  were used for the next studies .

the growth and total intracellular glutathione  content in h. polymorpha dl- <dig> wild-type strain during batch cultivation in fermenter was studied depending on growth parameters, ph and aeration . it was shown that this yeast produced more tig during cultivation in glucose minimal medium under conditions of spontaneous ph acidification from ph  <dig>  to  <dig>  as compared to that at mode during ph  <dig>  maintenance using an active ph control . it was demonstrated also that tig was higher at low stirrer speed  than under intensive aeration , independently of ph control regime . after  <dig> h of cultivation at  <dig> rpm, do parameter dropped from  <dig> - 98% to  <dig> - 4% and was maintained at the latter level till the end of process, in contrast to cultivation at 600- <dig> rpm, when the excess of oxygen was provided to culture during all process . maximal cell biomass concentration was higher under conditions of high saturation with oxygen  as compared to low aeration , independently on the mode of ph control .

it should be noted that the level of total extracellular glutathione  gsh+gssgex relative to that of tig  became significant in the cases of high agitation , independently on ph control mode . to explain these results, one may suggest that supply cells with more oxygen at 600- <dig> rpm provided more optimal growth conditions as we observed increase in biomass concentration. oxygen-limited yeast cells cultivated at low stirrer speed,  <dig> rpm, most probably are suffered from metabolic stress induced by oxygen limitation. this stress could reduce growth activity and turned on cellular protection mechanisms including glutathione biosynthesis  <cit> . the reasons of gsh+gssgex changes depending on oxygen level remain obscure.

biomass and glutathione production by h. polymorpha dl- <dig> wild type strain under fed-batch fermentation in glucose minimal medium under different modes of aeration
we compared biomass and glutathione producing capacities of h. polymorpha dl- <dig> wild-type strain under different dissolved oxygen  saturation conditions, do-stat 30% and do-stat 60%, provided in fed-batch cultures in glucose minimal medium  . similarly to batch culture cultivation, we observed elevated level  of tig content during fermentation at low oxygen supply, do-stat 30%, as compared to those at do-stat 60% . unexpectedly, enhanced oxygen supply  caused reduction of biomass yield of fed-batch cultivated wild-type cells in glucose-containing minimal medium . we hypothesize that yeast cells supplied with enhanced oxygen suffered from excess of reactive oxygen species. it is known that the lasts could suppress growth activity and trapped accessible for measurement glutathione in the reactions of s-glutathiolation of protein and conjugation with product of lipid peroxidation  <cit> .

in the meantime, intensification of oxygen supply led to slight increase in teg level . the maximal concentration of teg by the wild-type cells was negligible and comprised 4- <dig> mg/l as compared to maximal tig content ~ <dig> mg/l achieved under conditions of low oxygen supply, do-stat 30% under fed-batch conditions for the same cells .

biomass and glutathione production by h. polymorpha dl- <dig> recombinant strains at fed-batch fermentation in glucose minimal medium
we hypothesized that accumulation of elevated tig level can be achieved in recombinant h. polymorpha strains which overexpress this tripeptide. consequently, we have studied tig production in several h. polymorpha recombinant strains which harbored the additional copies of hpgsh <dig> gene. as it was revealed earlier, h. polymorpha gsh <dig> gene, hpgsh <dig>  a homologue of s. cerevisiae gsh <dig> gene, encoding gcs, the first enzyme of gsh biosynthesis, is essential for yeast growth and stress reply  <cit> . one of the obtained in the present study recombinant strains designated as mcgsh <dig> transformant possessed 2- <dig> copies of hpgsh <dig> expression cassette under native h. polymorpha gsh <dig> promoter . another recombinant strain, named as moxp-gsh <dig> transformant, acquired hpgsh <dig> expression cassette under control of the strong promoter of h. polymorpha alcohol oxidase mox gene. the mox promoter is known to be regulated in h. polymorpha by mechanisms of glucose repression-derepression and methanol induction  <cit> . we also studied transformant named as mcmet <dig> that obtained 2- <dig> additional copies of h. polymorpha met <dig> gene , putative homologue of s. cerevisiae met <dig> gene involved in biosynthesis of gsh and its precursor, cysteine  <cit> .

all indicated strains displayed the growth kinetics under fed-batch fermentation process at do-stat 30% in glucose minimal medium very similar to that of the wild-type strain, except slightly elevated maximal biomass concentration of mcgsh <dig> and mcmet <dig> recombinant strains  . if to express glutathione/protein ratio, the highest tig concentration was found in mcgsh <dig> transformants . however, when we compared tig concentrations as the mass percentage of total glutathione to the total dry cell weight  or per liter of culture medium , the best tig producer appeared to be the moxp-gsh <dig> recombinant strain . we explained such data discrepancy by differences in protein content of the compared strains. the strains in decreasing order of tig concentrations  can be ranged in the following order: moxp-gsh <dig> -  <dig> %, mcgsh <dig> -  <dig> %; mcmet4-  <dig> %; wild type - <dig> %. the same order of strains was if to express tig concentration in mg/l: moxp-gsh <dig> -  <dig> mg/l; mcgsh <dig> -  <dig> mg/l; mcmet4-  <dig> mg/l; wild type - <dig> mg/l.

thus, introduction of additional copies of putative hpmet <dig> gene into the genome of recipient strain  <dig> -fold increased the tig level in mcmet <dig> transformant, probably, due to activation of biosynthesis of gsh precursor, cysteine.

mcgsh <dig> transformant displayed only  <dig>  times enhanced tig level as compared to that in the wild-type strain in spite of obtaining of 3- <dig> copies of hpgsh <dig> gene. we have found the hpgsh <dig> gene overexpression in mcgsh <dig> transformant cultivated in medium without any carbon substrate . such conditions resembled fed-batch cultivation where glucose concentrations was maintained at the level lower than  <dig> - <dig> %. it seems that gsh excess restricted glutathione overproduction in our recombinant strains by mechanism of feedback inhibition of gcs activity.

nevertheless we did not confirm regulated from mox promoter expression of hpgsh <dig> gene  in the recombinant strain that obtained such construct. mode of expression of hpgsh <dig> gene from mox promoter was the same as in the wild-type strain . so,  <dig>  times improvement of glutathione production in moxp-gsh <dig> transformant could be explained by insertion of cassette into some regulatory locus important for gsh biosynthesis or under unknown promoter.

concentration of the teg  by the studied wild type and recombinant strains was negligible: 2- <dig> mg/l as compared to their tig level comprising of 910- <dig> mg/l .

biomass and glutathione production by h. polymorpha dl- <dig> wild type and moxp-gsh <dig> recombinant strains during fed-batch fermentation in methanol minimal medium
hpgsh <dig> transcript analysis revealed methanol-dependent induction of this gene expression in all studied strains compared to that of glucose incubated yeast cells . nevertheless, we did not observe strong increase of tig concentration in methanol-feeding wild type cells  relative to that of glucose-feeding cells  . methanol fed-batch fermentations study was carried out only under do-stat 60% that provides the highest biomass yield of h. polymorpha compared to do-stat 30%  <cit> . moderate tig concentrations  during methanol feeding process was partially compensated by high maximal concentration of biomass . we suggested that application of oxygen control during methanol feeding under fed-batch cultivation prevents the over-feeding of methanol and overaccumulation of toxic intermediates that could additionaly induce gsh biosynthesis  <cit> .

studied here moxp-gsh <dig> recombinant strain was characterized by normal growth in glucose fed-batch cultures with minimal medium  but displayed retarded growth in methanol as the sole carbon source as compared to the wild-type strain . during growth in methanol fed-batch culture, moxp-gsh <dig> recombinant strain accumulated about 2- <dig>  fold more tig  than the parental strain . the concentration of tig  in this transformant two-fold exceeded that produced by the wild-type strain only in the last period of cultivation . the level of teg in moxp-gsh <dig> transformant grown in methanol was found to be the highest  among all tested strains and conditions , though it was significantly elevated only at the late fermentation period .

reduced ability of moxp-gsh <dig> recombinant strain to grow in methanol medium could be caused by inhibition of key enzyme of formaldehyde assimilation, dihydroxyacetone synthetase, by excess of gsh  <cit>  or partial impairment of mox gene expression as the result of moxp-gsh <dig> expression vector integration into the chromosomal mox locus  <cit> .

so, high-cell-density cultivation of h. polymorpha dl- <dig> wild type strain led to accumulation of large amount of glutathione under dual control of substrate feeding . glucose feeding controlled by do-stat 30% was found to promote the biomass and tig concentration of the wild-type strain to  <dig> g/l and  <dig> mg/l, respectively . using the methanol feeding control by do-stat 60%, the biomass and tig levels of the wild-type strain reached  <dig> g/l and  <dig> mg/l, respectively. genetic engineering of sulfur metabolism and glutathione biosynthetic pathway improved the productivity of glutathione synthesis in h. polymorpha recombinant strains  <dig> - <dig>  times. tig, teg and biomass concentrations of the best glutathione-producing recombinant strain, moxp-gsh <dig>  under methanol fed-batch cultivation comprised  <dig> mg/l,  <dig> mg/l and  <dig> g/l, respectively, and at glucose feeding process these parameters were  <dig> mg/l,  <dig> mg/l and  <dig> g/l.

one of the best published results on gsh and biomass level for high-gsh-accumulated strain of s. cerevisiae g- <dig> was reported to be  <dig> mg/l and  <dig> g/l, respectively, after  <dig> h of high-cell-density cultivation with control of glucose feeding by respiratory quotient and ethanol concentration. optimized process for this strain with addition of amino acids resulted in the glutathione concentration elevation to  <dig> mg/l  <cit> . genetically modified strains of the methylotrophic yeast h. polymorpha dl- <dig> studied in the present work, appeared to be competitive glutathione producer with good perspectives for further improvement.

to develop the process of glutathione production based on described here h. polymorpha producers, we plan to further optimize growth conditions to increase biomass concentration. other approach we plan to use will be based on engineering gcs protein for impairment of feedback inhibition normally exerted by glutathione. gcs feedback inhibition engineering will be carried out on the isolated in our laboratory h. polymorpha mutants defective both in glutathione uptake and secretory pathways which we found to possess elevated glutathione pool . it is known that s. cerevisiae mutants defective in glutathione transport and in secretory pathways overaccumulate glutathione in the medium  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study has estimated biothechnological potential of the methylotrophic yeast h. polymorpha to produce antioxidant glutathione used as medicine, food additives and in cosmetic industry. our data showed that recombinant strains of h. polymorpha with genetically engineered pathway of global sulfur and glutathione metabolism accumulated the highest to our knowledge titre of intracellular and extracellular glutathione under optimized conditions. we consider h. polymorpha as the yeast with good perspectives for further improvement especially for production of extracellular form of glutathione.
