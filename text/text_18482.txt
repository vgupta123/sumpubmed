BACKGROUND
streptococcus agalactiae, or group b streptococcus, is a gram-positive bacterium known as a commensal of the digestive and genitourinary tracts of 10–30% of the human population  <cit> . it emerged during the 1960s as a leading cause of neonatal infections, causing pneumonia, septicemia and meningitis  <cit> . it also represents an increasing cause of infections in the elderly and in adults with underlying diseases  <cit> . in addition, s. agalactiae is frequently associated with animal diseases, being responsible for bovine mastitis  <cit>  and for massive epidemic outbreaks in fish farms  <cit> . while a number of s. agalactiae factors involved in host colonization or in virulence have been described  <cit> , the transcriptional networks coordinating their expression during the progression from commensalism to virulence, or in response to changing host environments, are still largely unknown  <cit> . as many as  <dig> putative transcriptional regulators and 17– <dig> two-component regulatory systems  are annotated in s. agalactiae genomes  <cit> . five tcss  were shown to control the expression of virulence factors  <cit> . in particular, the covrs system, also called csrrs, is a major regulator of gene expression in s. agalactiae, governing directly or indirectly the expression of more than 7% of the genome, including many virulence associated genes  <cit> . the expression of the covr/covs-controlled genes was found to be deeply modified in response to environmental variations such as shifts to acidic ph  <cit> . s. agalactiae encounters acidic ph at crucial steps of the colonization and invasion processes, such as during the adaptation to the vaginal cavity or during intracellular survival in macrophages  <cit> .

over the past ten years, our understanding of bacterial transcription has greatly advanced thanks to the combination of high-throughput technologies, namely tiling arrays and deep rna sequencing  with classical genetics and biochemical assays. in particular, rna-seq has offered tremendous power for high-resolution transcriptome characterization, allowing both differential-expression analysis and identification of new transcripts not predicted by bioinformatics. characterization of the primary transcriptome, which is a catalog of all expressed rna molecules that carry a 5′-triphosphate group indicative of transcription start sites , has also greatly facilitated the identification of promoter regions and their interspecies comparisons  <cit> . these genome-wide transcriptome studies revealed a widespread antisense transcription, frequent read-through of terminators and transcription initiations inside cistrons, which altogether challenged the conventional view of the operon  <cit> . they also identified dozens of novel small rnas  potentially involved in the regulation of gene expression by interfering with rna transcription, translation and stability  <cit> . as their target genes were characterized, these srnas emerged as key regulators of metabolic, physiological and pathogenic processes.

in this work, we aimed at characterizing the transcriptional landscape of s. agalactiae by a thorough identification of the promoter regions and operon structure, as well as of srnas and cis regulatory 5′ untranslated regions . we combined differential rna-seq , and strand-specific rna-seq on multiple rna samples from the model strain nem <dig> to maximize the identification of 5′ and 3′ ends. this revealed an unexpected high number of tsss associated with a reiterative transcription suggesting new potential regulatory mechanisms. among  <dig> cis-regulatory regions identified, eleven were novel and two were found to respond to acidic conditions. ten out of  <dig> intergenic srnas were also predicted to be involved in s. agalactiae response to acid stress. this comprehensive characterization of s. agalactiae transcriptional landscape paves the way for further deciphering the regulatory networks that coordinate gene expression during the progression from commensalism to virulence.

RESULTS
genome-wide mapping of tsss maximized by multiple differential rna-seq
to globally identify tsss in s. agalactiae, we used a differential rna-seq  strategy, based on selective tobacco acid pyrophosphatase  treatment and 5′ adapter ligation, which differentiates primary transcripts and processed rnas  <cit> . to increase the sensitivity and the robustness of tss detection, we performed four independent experiments with rna extracted from strain nem <dig> grown under different growth or stress conditions : mid-exponential and late-exponential growth phases in a rich culture medium  and acid stress condition. the last sample was a mix of rnas prepared at mid-exponential and stationary growth phases in rich culture medium and at the beginning of stationary phase in a poor culture medium. in addition, we performed tss mapping on three nem <dig> derivatives in which the ciarh, relrs or covrs tcs loci were deleted. as these tcs may act as positive or negative regulators depending on their targets, we speculated that their inactivation would increase the transcription of genes weakly or not expressed in the wt strain under the conditions tested. two growth conditions  were used for the covrs mutant, while the relrs and ciarh mutants were grown to early or late exponential phases, respectively.

a total of ~ <dig> million sequence reads were generated under tap+ and tap- conditions for the  <dig> libraries . reads were aligned on the s. agalactiae nem <dig> genome sequence  <cit> , with  <dig>  and  <dig>  million reads on average aligning to non-ribosomal regions under tap+ and tap- conditions, respectively. the density of reads aligned on the chromosome was higher on the leading strand . this reflects the general bias in gene orientation in s. agalactiae, with 81% of the coding sequences transcribed in the same direction as the movement of the replication fork. tap+ and tap- profiles were similar except at discrete positions, mostly found close to the annotated start codon of coding sequences , where the number of reads under tap+ conditions largely exceeded that under tap- conditions . this difference was used to discriminate between native and processed rna ends and to predict tsss. the large number of sites corresponding to processed ends was used to estimate the dispersion parameters of the experiments and to infer a statistical significance to the tap+/tap- differences at each position, as described in the “methods” section. combination of the tsss identified under the eight experimental conditions led to a final list of  <dig>  tsss determined with high confidence. in addition  <dig> tsss predicted with a lower degree of confidence from the drna-seq experiments were confirmed by the rna-seq analysis . 80% of the  <dig>  tsss were detected in the rna sample pool corresponding to the mixture of growth conditions  and 60% of the tsss were predicted under at least four conditions . globally, the sensitivity of detection was strongly improved by combining growth conditions and by including mutants of transcriptional regulators. the position of the  <dig>  tsss and the normalized number of tap+ reads associated to these tsss under the eight conditions are given in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig> characterization of transcription start sites in s. agalactiae.

tsss were further classified according to their position relative to the cdss. 75%  were tsss upstream protein-coding genes, among which  <dig> corresponded to primary tss and  <dig> to secondary tss. we identified  <dig> and two protein-coding genes preceded by two promoters and three promoters, respectively. the start codons for  <dig> genes, in which the tss was downstream the previously predicted translation initiation codon, were corrected and two new potentially coding genes were annotated.  <dig> tsss were located inside cds,  <dig> initiating transcription in the same orientation as the cds and  <dig> in the opposite orientation. five supplementary tss, close to cds  but in opposite orientation also initiated an antisense transcription. finally  <dig> tsss in intergenic regions were upstream potential srna and trna genes .table  <dig>

canonical sigma <dig> promoters are major determinants of transcription initiation in s. agalactiae
by analyzing the  <dig> nucleotides upstream each tss, we predicted promoter sequences related to the prototype sigma <dig> promoter   <cit> ) upstream 90% of the tsss  . for  <dig>  additional promoters, only the consensus sigma <dig> - <dig> box was identified. 64% of all the promoters had a tgn sequence extending the − <dig> consensus sequence. this high frequency of sigma <dig> promoters is in agreement with the identification of only three sigma factors in the genome sequence of strain nem316: the housekeeping sigma <dig>  comx and an ecf-type sigma factor  <cit> . for approximately 70% of the promoters, transcription initiation occurred at a single nucleotide located on average six nucleotides downstream the tata box . the initiating nucleotide was a  or g  reflecting the preference of the rna polymerase for purine residues as initiator nucleotides, as observed in bacillus subtilis and escherichia coli  <cit> . for the remaining 30% of the promoters, initiation arose at two to six tightly clustered nucleotides resulting from an alternative choice of the initiating nucleotide for half of the cases or from the incorporation of pseudo-templated nucleotides, which modified the apparent tss position.figure  <dig> the vast majority of s. agalactiae promoters are sigma <dig> dependent. a. motif search upstream of 1179/ <dig> s. agalactiae tsss reveals extended pribnow or − <dig> boxes and less conserved − <dig> boxes. the consensus sequence was generated using weblogo . b. mean distances between the − <dig> box and the tss  and between the − <dig> and − <dig> boxes . distances were calculated between the 3′ end nucleotide of the − <dig> box and the tss and between the 3′ nucleotide of the − <dig> box and the 5′ nucleotide of the tataat sequence.



reiterative initiation of transcription is frequent in s. agalactiae
reiterative transcription, also known as transcript slippage or pseudo-templated transcription was documented as an intrinsic property of rna polymerase from as early as  <dig>  <cit> . however, as it has been studied on a gene-by-gene basis, only a few examples have been reported to date in bacteria. its functional importance as a regulatory mechanism was demonstrated in the transcription of several genes involved in nucleotide metabolism such as pyrb <dig>  pyrg, carab, codba, upp-uraa in e. coli or b. subtilis and for the gal operon in e. coli  <cit> . we developed a method to mine drna-seq data for reiterative transcription at a genome-wide level. indeed, while the rna-polymerase stuttering at a promoter may lead to non-productive transcription, the switch to a non-reiterative nucleotide addition will generate a transcript differing in its 5′ end from its dna-template, by one or several nucleotides detectable by rna-seq.

by modifying our alignment protocol to systematically detect pseudo-templated nucleotides at transcript 5′ ends, we observed that up to 15% of s. agalactiae tsss were associated with a reiterative transcription . the proportion of transcripts with pseudo-templated nucleotides  and the number of added nucleotides  were variable among tsss. these non-templated nucleotides, most often a repeats   were generally associated with the presence of nucleotide stretches on the dna template, as reported  <cit> . however, we also observed reiterative process involving di or tri-nucleotides, as noted in eukaryotes  <cit> , with 15% of au reiteration.figure  <dig> extensive reiterative transcription in s. agalactiae.

analysis of genes subjected to reiterative initiation of transcription according to kegg functional annotation revealed an enrichment in genes involved in nucleotide metabolism , e.g., pyrg encoding the ctp synthetase. in b. subtilis, reiterative incorporation of pseudo-templated g nucleotides at pyrg tss was shown to occur when cells are starved for pyrimidines and to prevent transcription attenuation  <cit> . in s. agalactiae, both a similar tss sequence and a rho-independent terminator are detected upstream pyrg , suggesting a similar regulatory mechanism. another key enzyme in nucleotide biosynthesis, thymidylate synthetase , might also be regulated by reiterative transcription in s. agalactiae. indeed, transcription of thya occurs at a g or at the adjacent upstream t, where it leads to reiterative addition of up to six u residues . the thya gene has a short 12-nt long 5′utr and the tss corresponds to the first g residue of the shine-dalgarno sequence . this suggests a mechanism where, depending on the intracellular pools of gtp and utp, the amplitude of reiterative transcription might modulate thya mrna translation initiation. interestingly the proportion of rnas with pseudo-templated nucleotides varied according to the growth condition tested, supporting that reiterative transcription has a regulatory function .

our results show for the first time that reiterative transcription is an extensive process in s. agalactiae. we only considered the incorporation of pseudo-templated nucleotides linked to the switch to productive transcription. therefore our data provide a minimal estimate of the whole tendency of the polymerase at a given tss sequence to enter into the reiterative mode and the true incidence of reiterative transcription is likely underestimated. expression of several genes regulated by reiterative transcription-dependent mechanisms was found to be strongly affected during cellular stress created by intermediary metabolites imbalances in e. coli leading to variations in intracellular nucleotide pools  <cit> . our results show that drna-seq may be used to capture some of the modifications at the transcript 5′ end, allowing a more systematical characterization of the metabolic factors that regulate gene expression by acting on the extent of repetitive nucleotide addition or on the choice of the initiating nucleotide.

the s. agalactiae transcriptional landscape
 <dig>  protein coding genes,  <dig> pseudogenes, seven rrna clusters and  <dig> trna genes were annotated in strain nem <dig> genome  <cit> . to describe the operon organization, we combined to the tss analysis whole transcript sequencing . we chose a two-step adaptor ligation-based directional rna-seq protocol, which provides transcript coverage in a strand-specific manner and permits a precise mapping of transcript 3′ ends  <cit> . rna-seq analysis was performed on three independent biological replicates of exponentially growing bacteria submitted or not to a 20 minutes acid stress . for each library more than ~ <dig> million reads mapping to non-ribosomal regions were analyzed . the number of reads mapped to each coding sequence  was corrected for gene length and library depth to generate normalized reads per kilobase  per million mapped reads . under the conditions tested, 79%  of the annotated genes or pseudogenes of s. agalactiae were expressed, using a detection threshold of three rpkm. by analyzing the distribution of the reads along the genome sequence, we characterized the 3′ end of  <dig> transcripts . 92%  of them correspond to rho-independent terminators predicted in the s. agalactiae genome  <cit>  confirming that they are bona fide transcription termination sites.

taking into account the information from tss and transcript mapping, we predicted  <dig> polycistronic transcription units containing two to  <dig> genes . seventy-one contain internal tsss and  <dig> internal terminators and might be further divided into sub-operons . this occurrence of internal promoters and terminators might lead to differential expression of the genes of the same operon as already noted in other genome-wide studies  <cit> .  <dig> additional internal tsss  were located in monocistrons or in the last gene of an operon. they might correspond to promoters of small coding or non- coding rnas transcribed in the same orientation as the major transcription unit. two operons associate protein coding genes and trna genes . finally,  <dig> genes are transcribed as monocistronic units . globally, our operon map covers 85% of s. agalactiae coding genes and 98% of the genes expressed in the conditions we have tested .

we also detected a significant level of antisense transcription  on  <dig> genes . for more than 70% of these genes, the antisense transcript was found to likely result from transcriptional read-through of terminators of genes in convergent orientation. these antisense transcripts, resulting from terminator read-through, extended up to 12 kb beyond the 3′ boundaries of their cognate cds.

length distribution of 5′ untranslated regions 
analysis of the distance between tsss and the translation initiating codons in s. agalactiae  showed that about half of the coding transcriptional units have 5′utrs 15- to 35- nt long. conversely, 8% of the mrnas  are leaderless, an intermediate proportion compared to helicobacter pylori   <cit>  and deinocococcus deserti   <cit> . all of the leaderless transcripts share an aug start codon and 90% of them begin at the a residue of the initiation codon. these two characteristics were found to be major determinants of ribosome recognition and binding to leaderless mrnas in e. coli  <cit> , suggesting efficient translation of leaderless mrnas in s. agalactiae. interestingly, the hola/gbs <dig> and gbs <dig> leaderless transcripts, encoding the dna polymerase iii subunit delta and a nad-dependent dehydrogenase also showed an addition of pseudo-templated nucleotides at their 5′ ends and their translation might vary according to the amplitude of reiterative transcription. on the other hand,  <dig> transcription units, including genes involved in virulence such as the cyl  operon, the scpb gene encoding the c5a-peptidase, and the major tcs regulator of virulence covrs displayed 5′utr longer than  <dig> nucleotides possibly involved in the regulation of transcript stability and translation.figure  <dig> distribution of 5′utr lengths in s. agalactiae. numbers of mrna individual 5′utrs according to their length based on  <dig> primary tsss upstream coding genes.  <dig> genes were considered as leaderless with 5′utrs shorter than  <dig> nucleotides, as indicated by the red box. 49% of the 5′utrs have a size comprised between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides as indicated by black vertical lines



rna-seq evidence for riboswitches and new cis-regulatory sequences
we combined different approaches to identify riboswitches and cis-regulatory sequences. first, long 5′utrs  were screened for similarity to known cis-regulatory sequences in the rfam database  <cit>  and for the presence of predicted rho-independent terminators . this in silico analysis was then confronted to experimental evidence: premature termination of transcription and production of a srna deduced from rna-seq data. altogether,  <dig> regulatory regions belonging to known rfam families were detected , among which  <dig> were previously predicted through a computational analysis of the genome of s. agalactiae strain 2603 v/r  <cit> . for  <dig> of them, a non-coding rna was detected together with a longer transcript encompassing the downstream cds. four additional 5′utrs contained predicted rho-independent terminators, but transcription termination was not observed by rna-seq analysis. the absence of termination likely results from a fully “open” conformation of the regulatory elements under the experimental growth conditions used. therefore  <dig> out of the  <dig> rfam-predicted 5′ cis-regulatory regions might act through a premature termination of transcription.

we identified riboswitches for flavin mononucleotide  , for thiamine pyrophosphate  , for purine , for glycine  and for prequeuosine , as well as seven t-box leaders responsible for the response to uncharged trnas . the other cis-regulatory elements included leader sequences acting through the binding of the ribosomal proteins l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig> and binding sites for the regulator of pyrimidine biosynthesis pyrr. the ligands for certain sequences, such as one known as the yybp-ykoy leader found upstream the gene for a putative ca2+ or mg2+/atpase  are still unknown. interestingly, we observed that the efficiency of transcription termination directed by the yybp-ykoy leader increased in conditions of acid stress . indeed, while the expression of the leader sequence was not significantly modified after 20 minutes at ph  <dig> , expression of the gbs <dig> cds decreased by more than three-fold. this result suggests that, in s. agalactiae, the yybp-ykoy leader riboswitch senses directly or indirectly a ph modification. a function of ph-responsive riboregulator was also recently proposed for the srfa riboswitch in e. coli, the sequence of which partly overlaps with the yybp-ykoy leader sequence consensus  <cit> . an inverse behavior was observed for the glycine riboswitch upstream gbs <dig> encoding a putative alanine/glycine cation symporter. while transcription predominantly terminated at the rho-independent terminator at neutral ph, the shift to a lower ph was associated with an increased transcription of the coding part, suggesting a change in the riboswitch structure. this glycine riboswitch might therefore act as a dual riboswitch sensing both the presence of glycine and another signal induced during acid stress .

eleven sequences located in the 5′utr of coding genes share characteristics with cis-regulatory elements, despite the absence of similarity with rfam families . for all these sequences, rna-seq experiments revealed a short non-coding  form and a long transcript sharing the same tss, supporting a cis-regulatory mechanism. we identified one of these sequences in the 5′utr of the essential operon gbs0413-gbs <dig> encoding the ribosome maturation factor rimp, the elongation factor nusa, the translation initiation factor if <dig>  the ribosome-binding factor a and two conserved proteins of unknown functions. transcription termination occurred  <dig> nucleotides downstream the tss at a predicted intrinsic terminator. nusa has been shown to stimulate pausing of the elongating rna polymerase, facilitating transcription termination at rho-independent terminators  <cit> . combined with our data, this suggests that nusa mediates in s. agalactiae a negative feedback regulation of the gbs0413-gbs <dig> operon. a similar mechanism has been proposed from the analysis of nusa mutations in e. coli for the mety-nusa-infb operon  <cit> . therefore, this autoregulation might be conserved among the gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.

two potential cis-regulatory elements, 195- and 270-nt long, respectively, are located upstream two paralogous operons encoding abc-transporters, gbs1262-gbs <dig> and gbs2033-gbs <dig>  respectively, hinting that transcription of these operons might be regulated by new riboswitches sensing the substrates of the abc-transporters. searching for similar sequences revealed that the two elements are conserved among lactobacillales . a secondary structure based on sequence alignment and sequence covariations was predicted for each element . in addition to genes encoding abc transporters, the gbs <dig> riboswitch was also identified upstream the enterococcus faecium arofbc-tyra operon involved in aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. a sequence similar to gbs <dig> riboswitch was identified upstream the gene encoding a tryptophan synthase beta chain in fusobacterim nucleatum. these results suggest that these cis-regulatory elements belong to new families of riboswitches sensing aromatic amino acids or their precursors.figure  <dig> identification of a novel riboswitch upstream gbs <dig>

genome-wide identification of s. agalactiae srna repertoire
tss mapping identified  <dig> tsss potentially initiating an antisense transcript, as well as  <dig> tsss in intergenic regions not directly linked to protein coding genes or to trna genes. the rna-seq data confirmed transcription of these  <dig> antisense or intergenic srna and identified three supplementary srnas: two located in intergenic regions, which likely result from the processing of a longer rna, as no tss was identified by drna-seq experiments and one srna initiated at a tss located at the end of a non-expressed coding gene .  <dig> among the  <dig> srnas detected were predicted in a previous in silico study that identified  <dig> srnas in intergenic regions and  <dig> antisense rnas  <cit> . the incomplete overlap between srnas identified through bioinformatics and experimental detection has already been noticed  <cit>  and may be due to srnas expressed under very specific conditions. on the other side, in silico approaches may generate false positive candidates or incomplete predictions linked to the criteria used. some of the antisense rnas, such as those overlapping sfba  <cit>  or the gene for the streptococcal histidine-triad family protein   <cit> , might be involved in the regulation of s. agalactiae virulence by interfering with the stability or translation of their cognate mrna.

seven srnas  were chosen for further expression analysis by northern blot . these experiments confirmed that all are expressed and showed differential patterns of growth phase-dependent accumulation and induction in response to stresses. for example, srn <dig> was induced at the onset of the stationary phase  and during stress adaptation to high nacl concentration . in contrast expression of srn <dig>  a 200 nt-long rna with a rfam asd rna motif  <cit>  also identified in streptococcus pyogenes  <cit> , was strongly down-regulated at late stationary phase .

cia-dependent srnas  were first described in streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans where they are involved in stationary-phase autolysis  <cit> , regulation of competence  <cit>  and virulence  <cit> . based on sequence similarity, four csrnas were predicted in s. agalactiae  <cit> . here, we detected by rna-seq these four csrnas, showed that their sizes ranged from  <dig> to 140 nt and identified their respective tsss and promoter sequences . the tsss could not be detected in drna-seq experiments with the ∆ciarh mutant, in agreement with a strong control of their expression by ciar . northern blot analysis on csrna10/srn <dig>  csrna11/srn <dig> and csrna12/srn <dig> showed growth-phase dependent accumulation . in addition, srn <dig> and srn <dig> were strongly induced in response to acid stress . this induction was confirmed by quantitative analysis of the rna-seq experiments . the expression of the  <dig> csrnas and of  <dig> additional srnas  was induced by more than two-fold at a ph of  <dig> , whereas four others  were downregulated. these observations strongly suggest that srna-mediated regulation plays a role in s. agalactiae adaptation to the various environments it encounters during colonization and infection, particularly to acidic conditions. quantitative analysis of the rna-seq data also revealed more than two-fold variations in the expression of  <dig> coding genes as a result of ph modification . in particular, many genes involved in s. agalactiae virulence were expressed at a higher level at neutral ph, such as the cyl operon and the capsule operon and the genes encoding the c5a peptidase, the c5a-related peptidase and the fibrinogen-binding proteins a, b and c, in agreement with previously published results  <cit> . significant variations in the expression of four srnas  and the cyle gene in response to acid stress were further confirmed by using qrt-pcr experiments .figure  <dig> modifications in srna expression in response to an acidic stress. a. detection of srn015/csrna <dig> and srn070/csrna <dig> by combined analysis of rna-seq and drna-seq experiments is given as an example of srna detection b. srna expression was quantified using rna-seq  on exponentially growing bacteria submitted or not to a 20 min-acid stress. normalization and statistical assessment were performed using the edger software. expression values were arbitrarily fixed to  <dig> for samples grown at ph <dig>  ten srnas were shown differentially regulated  in acidic conditions:  <dig> up-regulated, left panel and  <dig> down-regulated, right panel.



in addition to the four csrnas,  <dig> other srnas matched rfam families, including transfer-messenger rna  involved in the recycling of stalled ribosomes, 6s/ssrs rna, signal recognition particle rna  and m1/rnpb rna, the rna component of ribonucleasep  involved in the maturation of trnas and of some srnas. combined tss mapping and rna-seq revealed that rnpb rna likely results from the processing of a longer transcript, comprising the cds for the cell division protein gpsb , for a rna methylase potentially involved in the modification of 23s rna m2g <dig>  and for a protein of unknown function . the association between the three coding genes and rnasep mrna is conserved among all streptococci, suggesting a functional and regulatory link between these genes. recently, rnasej was shown to be implicated in generating rnpb 5′ end in staphylococcus aureus  <cit> .

the tracrrnas are key components of type ii clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  system. as first shown in s. pyogenes, they direct the processing of crrnas involved in the sequence-specific recognition and the silencing of invading mobile elements  <cit> . two tracrrna forms, with the same 3′ end but differing by their tss, were identified, as well as  <dig> small crrnas resulting from the efficient processing of a  <dig>  nt-long pre-crrna in strain nem <dig>  the leader-proximal and leader-distal crrnas were more abundant than crrnas from the central part of the array, suggesting differential maturation or stability of the crrnas of the array . analysis of rna 5′ ends allowed the characterization of crrna maturation sites at the nucleotide level, showing that crrnas resulted from processing at two sites, as previously observed in s. pyogenes  <cit>  . unique to s. agalactiae, a short ~100 nt-long antisense rna transcript, overlapping the tracrrna 3′ end, was detected and might indirectly regulate the crispr response by modulating expression of the tracrrnas . this supplementary level of complexity in the regulation of crrna maturation might help s. agalactiae to cope with the various genome invaders encountered in the different niches it colonizes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we combined drna-seq and strand-specific rna-seq to characterize, at the single nucleotide resolution, the transcriptional landscape of s. agalactiae. with our modified protocol of drna-seq analysis, we were able to detect a surprising high level of reiterative transcription in s. agalactiae. to our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide determination of the genes affected by reiterative transcription. initiation of transcription is a target of global regulations such as these, which are mediated by the intracellular concentration of initiating nucleotides and by the stringent response. in this context, repetitive nucleotide addition might serve as a mechanism to translate this global information on the metabolic status of the cell into modifications in gene expression. this might be accomplished by affecting the transition to the transcription elongation step or by leading to changes in the secondary structure of the transcript. based on this work, systemic mining of rna-seq data will likely uncover the extent of reiterative transcription in other prokaryotes or eukaryotes and reveal new mechanisms of regulation relying on the non templated addition of nucleotides at the 5′-end of mrnas. combined rna-seq and drna-seq approaches were also efficient in characterizing new cis-regulatory regions, riboswitches and srnas. by introducing this new information into the quantitative analysis of our rna-seq data, we analyzed variations in srna levels in response to acid stress. we found that expression of at least ten srnas, including the four csrnas, is modified in response to a ph variation, suggesting that these srnas are involved in s. agalactiae adaptation to its changing environments. since adaptation to acidic conditions is important to colonize the vaginal niche and to survive in macrophage phagosome, these srnas might play a role in controlling the virulence of s. agalactiae, as previously shown for one of the csrnas in s. pneumoniae  <cit> . our results pave the way for deciphering the regulatory networks in which these srnas are involved and further understanding their biological functions.
