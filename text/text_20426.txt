BACKGROUND
cycles have a central role in control of continuing processes . therefore we expect the regulatory mechanism of a cell to have many cycles of interactions. only some of these interactions have the form of a transcription factor  regulating expression of a target gene. our question is: given that there are cycles of transcription interactions, are they important in the regulation of life processes?

graph properties of the regulatory networks have been reported in a number of papers. shen-orr et al.  <cit>  analyzed the regulatory networks statistically and observed certain characteristic motifs that are more frequent than in the random model and which have functional significance . cycles, or feedback loops also may have some typical regulatory role, e.g. they may be related to multiple steady states  <cit> .

luscombe et al.  <cit>  studied the dynamics of the regulatory network of saccharomyces cerevisiae as it changes for multiple conditions and proposed a method for the statistical analysis of network dynamics. they have found large changes in the topology of the network and compared it with random graphs. we have found that the transcription network of saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a single large strongly connected component , which we call lscc, and that the topology changes discussed by luscombe et al.  <cit>  are well reflected within lscc, in spite of its small size.

yu and gerstein  <cit>  have examined the structure of regulatory networks and showed that it exhibited a certain natural hierarchy. we propose another hierarchical partition of the network: above the lscc, the lscc, below the lscc and "parallel" to the lscc  and we show that this partition is in some sense natural.

comparisons of biological networks with random graphs were subject of methodological investigations of barabasi and albert  <cit>  who proposed a scale-free model. this model is difficult to apply here. while the networks we investigated have the key property of scale-free networks, i.e. they have many nodes with degree much higher than the average, the distribution of the degrees is too irregular to match with a particular power law. in a scale free network the ratio #{nodes with degrees k to 2k - 1} to #{nodes with degrees 2k to 4k - 1} is convergent, but in our networks it varies widely for different k's . therefore milo et al.  <cit>   proposed several methods of generating graphs that have the same in- and out-degrees as the reference network. we used their "matching algorithm" whenever possible, as well as faster and somewhat biased variants.

RESULTS
in the data set of luscombe et al.  <cit>  we can see the lscc with  <dig> tfs and one small strongly connected component with two tfs.

to see if the cycles of the lscc are significant, we checked how the topological changes of the transcription network during various physiological conditions are reflected inside the lscc, we checked several graph characteristics of the tfs in the lscc, and we compared the characteristics of the lscc to the cycles in random networks.

general characterization of the cycles
size of lscc is relatively small
the cycles form two connected components, one "degenerate", consisting of  <dig> tfs, and one "large", consisting of  <dig> tfs.

the degenerate component consists of two tfs with indistinguishable interactions that have self-loops, thus they are tfs of themselves, and of each other. this may be a result of a relatively recent gene duplication. thus we will ignore this cycle in our discussions.

the size of the largest cyclic component,  <dig>  is rather small compared with random models , with p-value ca.  <dig> . the number of nodes in the remaining cycles,  <dig>  is not very different from the average .

by the way of contrast, the transcription network of escherichia coli is either devoid of cycles or it contains very few of them .

lscc connected very strongly to the cell cycle
the transcription network reported by luscombe et al.  <cit>  has  <dig> tfs and  <dig> interactions, of which we disregard  <dig> "self-loop" interactions of the remainder  <dig> are tf to tf; we use itf to denote the latter set .  <dig> tfs and  <dig> interactions form the lscc. the subnetworks associated with the  <dig> stages of the cell cycle have  <dig> interactions in common , all of them directed to tfs  and  <dig> of them are present in the lscc. if even one of these two sets, lscc or ccc, is random, the expected number of common elements would be smaller than  <dig>  and the probability of |lscc ∩ ccc| ≥  <dig> would be below 10- <dig> . this shows that lscc is very strongly related to the cell cycle.

cycles of subnetworks other than cell cycle
stress response is special in the sense that it has cycles of its own, all of which involve yap <dig> that is not active in any other subnetwork. it seems that the cyclic interaction of this tf with two other tfs is a differentiating part of stress response condition from other exogenous conditions, diauxic shift and dna damage. the latter have similar sets of active interactions in lscc, but they lack  <dig> interactions involving yap <dig> 

one cycle consists of  <dig> interactions that are common to all conditions, reb <dig> → sin <dig> → hsf <dig> → reb <dig>  note that hsf <dig> is a heat stress factor, very important in the stress response, but also in "basal level sustained transcription" . one possible role of cycles in stress response is slowing down the recovery transition from the stress condition, so it can last several hours  <cit> . during the recovery, sporulation and cell cycle activities are suppressed. in this sense, stress response is partially endogenous to use the classification of luscombe et al.  <cit>  .

lscc has an orderly layout
fig.  <dig> shows the graph formed by the transcription factors and interactions of lscc, with nodes placed on a square grid as to minimize the edge lengths.

in the diagram, al  marks the nodes present in the cycles of all subnetworks. the cycles in the diauxic shift and dna damage subnetworks contain only these nodes. 

the cycles in the sporulation subnetwork sp contain apricot and strawberry nodes.

the cycles in the cell cycle subnetwork cc contain apricot, strawberry and cerulean nodes.

the cycles in the stress response subnetwork sr contain apricot and sienna nodes.

nodes that are not included in the cycles of any subnetwork are black.

we managed to find an orderly layout for lscc, in which few edges are long while nodes with the same color are grouped together.

lscc has small feedback vertex set
another property of lscc is that it has a small and unique minimum feedback vertex set, a set of nodes whose removal destroys all cycles.

the fact that there exists a unique minimum feedback vertex set with three nodes  can be clearly seen in fig.  <dig>  let us call this set f = { <dig>   <dig>  25}.

we can use f to distinguish three natural cyclic units within lscc, sb for each b ∈ f. we can think that b is the "boss" of sb. we define sb as the union of all simple cycles that go through b but not through f - {b}. only one node can have two bosses: {4} = s <dig> ∩ s <dig>  because there is only one path from  <dig> to  <dig> and three disjoint paths from  <dig> to  <dig>  we remove  <dig> from s <dig> to make our units disjoint. the three sets coincide well with functional categories: s <dig> = { <dig>   <dig>  24} are the nodes on cycles of lsccsr, s <dig> are the nodes on cycles of lsccsp, and s <dig> are the nodes on cycles of lscccc minus s <dig> . 

thus the cyclic subnework has three cyclic parts, plus two acyclic parts:  <dig> nodes on paths from s <dig> to s <dig>  and  <dig> node on a path from s <dig> to s <dig>  we show this schematically in fig.  <dig> 

differences and similarities of subnetworks are reflected in lscc
for subnetwork a we define lscca as the set of interactions of a that are also in lscc; to measure the difference between two sets we use |a ⊕ b|, the number of elements that are in one of the sets a and b but not in both.

one way that shows the importance of lscc to regulatory mechanism is that the differences and similarities between physiological conditions tend to be "exaggerated" when we use lscc as the "window". when we compare a symmetric difference of |itfx ⊕ itfy| with |lsccx ⊕ lsccy|, the size of the latter should be, on the average, 49/ <dig> of the former. these comparisons are in figure  <dig>  in general, sp is very related to cc, and the difference inside lscc is smaller than expected, while dd, ds and sr are unrelated, and the differences in lscc are larger than expected, especially in the case of sr, the stress response.

statistic profile of the tfs from the lscc for three different original networks
we tested properties of lscc in randomly generated networks. we also tabulated results of random tests based on two larger data sets. in our tables, we refer to the networks using names of the first authors of the paper in which they were published  <cit> , hence we call them luscombe, yu and balaji.

in our random networks we kept all original connections from tfs to terminal targets . the remaining connections were "rewired" at random, using three criteria, r, f and b. criterion r was a uniformly random permutation of the edge ends, conditional on obtaining a "correct network" – no self-loops or duplicated edges. criterion f was creating a bias in the selection of the permutation so the resulting number of feed-forward loops was close to the actual value in the original network. criterion b was similar, but with bi-fans rather than feed-forward loops.

when we refer to our computed average value we used form x  to denote "average obtained using criterion r ".

average size and out-degree
the size of lscc is quite a bit smaller than the average,  <dig> versus  <dig> , with p-value of  <dig>  , and the situation is similar for yu and balaji. 

the average number of targets for the tfs of the lscc is much higher than the average for all tfs,  <dig> versus  <dig>  this discrepancy is somewhat smaller when we make such a comparison in a random model,  <dig>  versus  <dig>  because cycles are sets of edges, it is very clear that a node with large out-degree has more chances to belong to a cycle, or a union of overlapping cycles that is lscc. for example, in the actual network, almost half members of lscc  belong to the top  <dig> tfs if we rank them by the number of the targets.

we use sscc to denote small cyclic scc's. the tfs that are neither in lscc nor in its in- or out-components are classified according to mpl, the maximal path length for a path that includes a given tf; when mpl is  <dig> or  <dig>  tf is in simple, if mpl is more than  <dig>  tf is in excp, and if mpl is  <dig>  we could make either decision, so here we inluded intermediate class int.

random graphs were produced to get a uniform distribution among graphs in which tfs have the same in-and out- degrees as in the original network, without changing the tf-tt connections.

see explanations for table  <dig>  generation of random graphs was altered to achieve the same number of feedforward loops as in the original network.

see explanations for table  <dig>  generation of random graphs was altered to achieve the same number of bi-fan motifs  as in the original network.

the lower average out-degree of the lscc in random models is perhaps a simple consequence of the fact that they have, on the average, much larger lscc, so the tfs from the top  <dig> tfs do not dominate the average as much as in the smaller lscc of the actual network. detailed comparisons of average out-degrees can be found in table  <dig> 

in this table, we have separate columns for results of random tests according to model r, f and b respectively. columns out give the average number of targets, and columns outf give the average number of targets that are tfs. note that in random networks the number of targets is the same for each tfs, so the average values for all tfs are always the same.

position of lscc in the hierarchy
only  <dig> tfs belong to the in-component of the lscc  in the sense that there are paths from these tfs to the lscc; of these  <dig> paths  <dig> are single edges and one consists of two edges. if we consider that path to be exception, collectively the lscc has unambiguous hierarchical position 2nd from the top. in a random network, on the average we have  <dig>  tfs in in-lscc. in this sense, the lscc is higher in the hierarchy than the average in the random models.

almost all paths with more than  <dig> edges are related to the lscc in the following sense: either they include a tf from the lscc, or form the final part of a path that starts in the lscc. two tfs form an exception to that rule, namely they can start a path with more than  <dig> edges that is not such a final part.

after collapsing scc's to single nodes we measured for each tf the maximum path length , and we call it mpl. for  <dig> tfs the value of mpl is at most  <dig>  and they form a rather separate part of the transcription network which we call simple.  <dig> tfs have mpl of at least  <dig>  maximum of mpl is  <dig>  more than the average in random networks that is  <dig>  . 

yu and gerstein  <cit>  propose a partition of networks according to the length of shortest paths to those tfs that have only tts as their targets. this definition would not work with the length of the shortest paths to tts: this length is  <dig> for all tfs but ten, and for that ten, it is  <dig>  so the hierarchy would be trivial. because lscc has such a special and statistically significant position in the network, we propose to partition tfs by their relation to lscc, as it is indicated in fig.  <dig>  in particular, tfs with a path to or from lscc are partitioned into hierarchy in-lscc, lscc and the out-component of lscc , while the remaining tfs are classified according to mpl; if mpl is at most  <dig>  they are in simple, if it is more than  <dig>  they are in excp, and if it is equal  <dig>  we place them in the intermediate class int .

we performed our study using the data of luscombe et al.  <cit>  because we wanted to compare the cycles with physiological subnetworks described in their paper. nevertheless, we compared our definition of a hierarchy with that of yu and gerstein  <cit> , who performed their investigation in a larger transcription network.

when we apply our program to the latter network, the proportions between the class sizes remain similar : in-lscc , lscc , out-lscc , simple  and excp . tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> show detailed comparison of class sizes.

we performed two tests applied by yu and gerstein to their classes .

when we checked the percentage of essential genes in our classes, we got 15% in in-lscc and lscc, 13% in out-lscc and 12% in simple, a more uniform distribution than among classes of yu and gerstein. a more striking difference exists when we check the percentage of cancer related genes: 10% in in-lscc,  <dig> % in lscc,  <dig> % in simple and  <dig> % in out-lscc.

the division we propose is closely related to the notion proposed by yu and gerstein: a division of transcription control mechanisms into reflex processes and cogitation processes. simple clearly corresponds to reflex processes. in a cogitation process, one that involves a long path of interactions, we can partition the process into beginning, middle and the ending part. as the various paths have very different lengths, identifying lscc as the middle is both "objective" and independent from the path length, and in the same time quite arbitrary. however, we show in the next subsection that lscc has a "switchboard" property even in the physiological conditions in which paths do not form cycles, and we just have seen that the percentage of cancer related genes sharply drops as we move from the middle to the final part of the long paths.

topological changes inside lscc
in fig.  <dig> and fig.  <dig> we can see the interactions of lscc that are active in various physiological conditions. we can observe large difference between the subnetworks, both in the composition and in topological characteristics like average path length.

luscombe et al.  <cit>  measured the following topological characteristic in the subnetworks: the average length of shortest paths from tfs to tts. by its very nature, lscc is disproportionally involved in that characteristic. in the full network there are  <dig>  such paths, and the average length is  <dig> ; among those paths,  <dig>  go through lscc, and their average length is  <dig> , while only  <dig>  paths does not go through lscc and their average length is  <dig> .

this domination of lscc directly follows from the fact that every tf in lscc and in-lscc has a path to every tt that can be reached from lscc, as a result, on the average one can reach  <dig> tts from these tfs through lscc . the average number of tts reachable not through lscc is  <dig> .

in other words, only 12% of shortest connections between tfs and tts does not go through lscc, and these paths contribute only  <dig> % to the sum of lengths.

because so many tf-to-tt paths go through lscc, the differences between average path lengths that were observed for different subnetworks by luscombe et al.  <cit>  are largely caused by the different presence of these networks in the lscc. in table  <dig> we use percentpath to denote the percentage of the shortest paths from transcription factors to the terminal targets that either originate or go through lscc, and percentlength to denote the similar percentage for the sum of lengths of shortest paths.

in each physiological subnetwork we consider the set p of pairs of the form tf-tt such that there is a chain of interactions  from the tf of the pair to the tt; for p ∈ p we define ℓp, the length of the shortest path for this pair; moreover, q is the subset of p such that the respective path has to go through lscc. then average path length = ∑p∈pℓp/|p|, percentpath = |q|/|p|, and percentpath = ∑p∈qℓp/∑p∈pℓp.

CONCLUSIONS
we inspected graph-theoretic properties of the cycles in the transcription network of saccharomyces cerevisiae. while in general cycles are "avoided" by the network, interactions common to all phases of the cell cycle form a big exception, and interactions specific to the stress response form a smaller exception. in spite of their modest number , the transcription factors that are included in cycles have a large topological impact: most of the shortest paths between transcription factors and terminal targets go through them.

one should compile many kinds of data to establish the exact role of the cycles of transcription interactions in controlling life processes. in particular, cell cycle, which is closely related to cancer, possesses a long cycle that can be easily interrupted at many different points, and the process itself can be interrupted by a number of different conditions .

we have shown that lscc is a key part of the regulatory network and that it can be divided into functional subunits. further work will yield fuller and clearer picture of these subunits and their interactions under various conditions.
