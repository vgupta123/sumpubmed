BACKGROUND
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  isolates have emerged as a leading cause of infectious diseases . once confined primarily to hospitals and patients with defined risk factors, infections caused by community-associated mrsa  isolates have become epidemic in the united states and now frequently occur among previously healthy individuals without these risk factors  <cit> . although the majority of ca-mrsa infections are mild, some ca-mrsa infectious syndromes such as complicated skin and soft tissue infections, necrotizing pneumonia, bacteremia, and sepsis can be life-threatening . after the first report of ca-mrsa deaths in children in it became recognized that the strain type was usa <dig> . during the early emergence of ca-mrsa, isolates of both mrsa and mssa with the usa <dig> pulsed field pattern were identified as causes of severe sepsis and death characterized by rapidly progressive clinical deterioration, with necrotizing pneumonia and multiple-organ-system involvement and bilateral adrenal hemorrhage characteristic of the waterhouse–friderichsen syndrome  <cit> . however, among community associated mrsa infections, usa <dig> has been nearly completely replaced by another ca-mrsa background, called usa <dig> . the reasons for the replacement of usa <dig> by usa <dig> are not known.

many have speculated that the dominance of usa <dig> is evidence of altered fitness. in support of this notion, usa <dig> strains are hypervirulent, compared with usa <dig> strains, in several animal models of skin infection and pneumonia  <cit> . although the relationship between fitness and virulence is not clear, understanding the mechanisms of the extraordinary virulence of usa <dig> strains will shed light onto the reasons for its emergence. the virulent nature of s. aureus is mediated by a wide array of cell surface proteins, secreted toxins and mobile genetic elements . as such there are at least two possible explanations for the virulence of usa <dig>  one is that usa <dig> strains have acquired novel genomic content that enhances its fitness and/or virulence. for example, among sequenced s. aureus isolates, the arginine catabolic mobile element  is present in most usa <dig> strains circulating in the united states, but not usa <dig> isolates  <cit> . acme is a large mobile genetic element also found in some staphylococcus epidermidis isolates encoding at least  <dig> open reading frames  <cit> . deletion of acme from usa <dig> enhanced survival in a rabbit model of bacteremia  <cit> , but acme was not necessary for virulence in rodent models of pneumonia or skin infection  <cit> . however, acme encodes an arginine deiminase gene, called arca that allows for enhanced survival in acidic environments  <cit> . interestingly, this process drives the synthesis of host polyamines that are toxic to s. aureus. it is likely not a coincidence that acme therefore also encodes a spermine acetyl transferase, speg, which counteracts the toxic effects of polyamines. in this regard, acme appears to at least partially account for the observed pathogenesis of usa <dig> in skin infection  <cit> . nevertheless, acme-deficient usa <dig> clinical isolates have been described supporting the data from animal models that acme is not a necessary component of pathogencity or survival in humans.

an alternative explanation is that usa <dig> has evolved to alter the expression/activity of s. aureus regulatory genes that are part of the core genome. in support of this idea, usa <dig> isolates have increased expression of the global regulatory systems agr and saers, and attendant increased expression of downstream toxins such as the panton-valentine leukocidin , the alpha-hemolysin , and phenol soluble modulins , compared to usa <dig>  <cit> . although there is a strong epidemiologic association of pvl carriage with severe disease caused by ca-mrsa, its role in pathogenesis is controversial. since pvl is present in both usa <dig> and usa <dig> isolates, it is not likely that its presence accounts for the differences in virulence between the genomic backgrounds. in contrast, agr, saers, hla and the psms which are core genes present in almost all s. aureus strains, clearly advance the pathogenesis of usa <dig> in animal models  <cit> . although it is known that usa <dig> has altered regulation of selected global regulators and virulence genes compared with usa <dig>  it is not known whether there are global differences in the transcription profiles between usa <dig> and usa <dig> 

by comparing the in vitro transcriptional profiles of usa <dig> and usa <dig> using dna microarray technology, we tested our hypothesis that usa <dig> strains have global regulatory alterations that contribute to their hypervirulent phenotype. to identify the possibility that the in vivo environment in host tissues can influence bacterial gene expression, we quantified bacterial gene expression in the lungs of animals infected with mrsa strains usa <dig> and usa <dig>  together our data offer a glimpse into ca-mrsa usa <dig> and usa <dig> pathogenesis and suggest a potential model for the observed increased virulence of s. aureus usa <dig> strains.

RESULTS
genomic characterization of usa <dig> and usa <dig> strains
to better understand the genomic diversity of usa <dig> and usa <dig> strains and the features that distinguish these two lineages,  <dig> usa <dig> clinical isolates and  <dig> usa <dig> isolates  were sequenced using roche  <dig> flx sequencing technology. the completely sequenced usa300_fpr <dig> strain was used as a reference for comparison to usa <dig> isolates, whereas usa <dig> strains were compared to s. aureus usa <dig> strain mw <dig>  these comparisons allowed us to identify  <dig>  genes that are uniformly conserved between all of the sequenced usa <dig> and usa <dig> isolates. the number of genes unique to either lineage was similar. usa <dig> genomes uniquely encode  <dig> genes  across all isolates, whereas usa <dig> isolates uniquely encode  <dig> genes  across all isolates. these genes were examined in greater detail by assessing their predicted functional roles. novel genes present in usa <dig> include a toxin-antitoxin system, the chemotaxis-inhibiting protein , and a number of hypothetical proteins in the Φsa3usa phage. each of these sequences displays an overall strong conservation within usa <dig> isolates. specifically, there were  <dig> genes that were unique to usa <dig> isolates compared to usa <dig> isolates in the Φsa3usa phage, as well as the acme element. all usa <dig> and  <dig> isolates were also compared to a variety of s. aureus sequence-types in a pangenome analysis . pangenome analysis revealed  <dig> major branches . these branches demonstrate strong clustering of our usa <dig> and usa <dig> lineages, compared to other sequence-type . genes specific to the usa <dig> lineage appear to be associated with bacteriophage and mobile genomic elements present in usa <dig> that are absent in the usa <dig> lineages. furthermore, ksnp analysis of core genes within our usa <dig> and  <dig> lineages  demonstrate a strong correlation with s. aureus strain sequence type.table  <dig>

in vitrodifferential gene expression between usa <dig> and usa <dig> isolates
in order to test our hypothesis that usa <dig> and usa <dig> strains differ in their global gene expression patterns, we compared global gene expression between a clinical usa <dig> isolate  and a clinical usa <dig> isolate  using dna microarrays. we compared gene expression patterns of cells grown in tsb medium at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 120 minutes of growth. an analysis of significant differences in gene expression using sam revealed  <dig> genes . the usa <dig> isolate displayed increased expression for genes encoding cell envelope proteins  and a large number of hypothetical and genes of unknown function compared with the usa <dig> isolate  <dig>  interestingly, genes belonging in mobile elements were more highly expressed in the usa <dig> strain compared to the usa <dig> isolate.figure  <dig>

among the genes with differential expression between the strains, there is higher expression in transcription of regulatory genes including agrbdc and rot, and differential expression of the two prophages present in the genomes of the sequenced usa <dig> and usa <dig> genomes. interestingly, among the genes deemed significantly differentially expressed that reside in the prophage Φsa2usa ,  <dig> were more highly expressed in the usa <dig> isolate, whereas  <dig> genes were more highly expressed in the usa <dig> strain. in contrast, the genes residing in prophage Φsa3usa were highly expressed in the usa <dig> strain and not detected in the usa <dig> strain . this is consistent with the fact that the prophage Φsa3usa insertion was only found to be present in the usa <dig> isolate and absent in the usa <dig> isolate, which is consistent with the reference usa <dig> and usa <dig> genomes.

analysis of genes known to play a role in neutrophil evasion functions displayed differential expression . genes that had significantly higher expression in the usa <dig> isolate compared with the usa <dig> strain included: immunoglobulin g binding protein a precursor , fibrinogen-binding protein , superantigen-like protein  and a leukocidin family protein . several genes encoded in the pathogenicity islands vsaα and vsaβ also more highly expressed in the usa <dig> isolate additional file 11: table s9). interestingly, compared with usa <dig>  we observed an overall reduced expression of genes located in the s. aureus pathogenicity island sapi <dig>  with the exception of the gene encoding the ear exoprotein that is associated with virulence in usa <dig>  there were also a number of lipoproteins and proteases more highly expressed in the usa <dig> isolate compared with usa <dig> strain. the gene encoding the igg binding protein, sbi, displayed slightly increased expression in the usa <dig> isolate. surprisingly, expression of agra and the δ-hemolysin were more highly expressed in the usa <dig> strain. other genes of interest that were more highly expressed in the usa <dig> strain included two antibacterial proteins and lukf-pv.

in vivodifferential gene expression comparison of usa <dig> and usa400
because it is not known if in vitro gene expression correlates with that seen in vivo, we sought to determine the differential expression of usa <dig> and usa <dig> isolates in vivo in a mouse model of lung infection by using complete genome qrt-pcr analysis. we chose to assess in vivo expression of bacteria during infection of lungs of mice 4 hours after inoculation with s. aureus because the number of bacteria recovered from the lungs at this time point is the same, regardless of the infecting isolate, because all animals are sick at this time, and because it is before the onset of mortality. consistent with this, all infected animals appeared ill at 6 hours post-infection. our results recapitulate other virulence studies as, nearly all  mice infected with usa <dig> strains died within  <dig> to 48 hours after inoculation, whereas none  of the mice infected with usa <dig> strains died. when using a cutoff of two-fold change in expression, we observed  <dig> genes with higher expression in the usa <dig> isolate compared to  <dig> genes displaying elevated expression in the usa <dig> strain. among these usa <dig> genes were encoded in acme, the prophages Φsa2usa and Φsa3usa, the pathogenicity islands vsaα and vsaβ, and genes arcc, argr, and coa. these data suggest that, although the usa <dig> isolate has increased in vitro expression compared with usa <dig> strains, the converse is true in vivo .

as we observed in the in vitro expression analysis, there were striking differences in the expression of the prophages Φsa2usa and Φsa3usa between usa <dig> and usa <dig> in vivo . in concordance with the in vitro data, genes in Φsa3usa were more highly expressed during lung infection in the usa <dig> isolate compared with the usa <dig> strain. however, whereas genes encoded in Φsa2usa were generally expressed at higher levels in usa <dig> compared with usa <dig> in vitro, the in vivo expression was generally higher in the usa <dig> isolate. this suggests that in vivo cue, and a potentially novel signal transduction network, is required for full expression of Φsa2usa, and other virulence genes, in s. aureus usa <dig> 

the in vivo expression of genes contained in acme was detected in lungs infected with usa <dig> but not usa <dig>  this was expected and validates our dna sequence data showing that acme is not present in the usa <dig> strain. as we observed in vitro, there were a number of lipoproteins whose expression during lung infection was higher in usa <dig> compared with usa <dig>  interestingly, there was strongly induced expression of the epidermin immunity protein operon after infection with usa <dig>  compared with usa <dig>  this operon has been previously associated with increased fitness of ca-mrsa strains due to its role in lantibiotic resistance  <cit> . notably, there was also higher expression of a cluster of urease genes in usa <dig> during infection of lungs compared with usa <dig>  these genes have been demonstrated to be induced during acid shock, and may serve as a mechanism to neutralize acidification of the phagolysosomal compartment and promote intracellular survival  <cit> . among the genes in usa <dig> whose expression increased during lung infection compared with usa <dig>  we were surprised to find the two-component global regulatory system saers and δ-hemolysin, in part, which is under the control of the agr effector, rnaiii. there was also increased in vivo expression of the toxin encoding genes hla, hlb, and hlc in usa <dig> strain .

discussion
usa <dig> mrsa isolates have emerged as the dominant cause of ca-mrsa infections in the united states. however, it has been unclear why usa <dig> has replaced its predecessor  in ca-mrsa infection. furthermore, understanding the rapid evolution that led to increased virulence of s. aureus usa <dig> isolates, compared with highly virulent usa <dig> isolates, can inform better strategies for treating and preventing ca-mrsa infections. previous work has suggested that the increased virulence of usa <dig> isolates might be due to increased expression of global regulators and toxin genes  <cit> . although this would explain the hypervirulent phenotype of usa <dig> isolates, the relationship between virulence and fitness is less well understood. in an effort to understand the contribution of genetic factors that contribute to the success of usa <dig>  we performed comparative genome sequencing of usa <dig> and usa <dig> isolates, in vitro gene expression analysis, and assessed in vivo gene expression by means of complete genome qpcr in an established mouse model of s. aureus necrotizing pneumonia.

analysis of the sequenced isolates revealed a strong conservation of genes between st <dig>  and st <dig>  isolates as expected. however, genes that were deemed unique to usa <dig> isolates include genes encoded in the acme element, the prophage Φsa3usa and a toxin-antitoxin system. however, many of these genes are not functionally characterized and are annotated as hypothetical with no defined function. it is well documented that mobile elements often encode genes that provide a fitness advantage in the form of antibiotic resistance determinants, toxins and intracellular survival determinants. it is plausible that many of the hypothetical genes we identified that are unique to usa <dig> isolates may have provided an in vivo fitness advantage and increased the virulence compared with usa <dig> and other s. aureus isolates.

although s. aureus gene expression was globally higher in isolate usa <dig> compared with usa <dig> in vitro, expression was globally higher in vivo during lung infection in usa <dig> isolate  <dig> compared with usa <dig> isolate  <dig>  in some cases, there was higher expression of lipoproteins in usa <dig> compared with usa <dig> during infection, just as there was in vitro. expression of the acme element was also increased in usa <dig> after infection, compared with usa400; this was expected because acme is only present in usa <dig> but it serves as a validation of the experiment. there was also increased expression of agrb, agrd, and Φsa3usa in usa <dig> during infection of lungs compared with usa <dig>  in concordance with the in vitro data. also to note was the increased expression of agra and hla in usa <dig> compared with usa <dig> during in vitro growth. previously, we observed increased in vitro expression of both agra and hla in usa <dig> compared with usa <dig>  however that observation was at a later time point during infection  <cit> .

on the other hand, expression of saers and δ-hemolysin  was higher in usa <dig> during infection compared with usa <dig>  both sae and agr are necessary for virulence in s. aureus necrotizing pneumonia caused by usa <dig> and it is likely that these are also important in usa <dig> necrotizing pneumonia  <cit> . there was also increased expression of the agr- and saers- controlled toxin genes hla, luks-pv, and  <dig> psms in usa <dig> compared with usa <dig> during infection. although usa <dig> has a higher ld <dig> than usa <dig> in rodent experimental models, it is nevertheless capable of producing a high mortality rate in groups of mice infected at its lethal dose  <cit> . moreover, when usa <dig> was still in circulation among humans in the united states, it was highly virulent as it was recognized for causing severe sepsis and rapidly progressive disease leading to death  <cit> . therefore, the finding that agr- and saers- controlled toxin genes hla, luks-pv, and  <dig> psms were expressed at higher levels in usa <dig> in this study reinforces the observation that usa <dig> was a virulent strain of s. aureus in humans. we note that our study is a single time point, and s. aureus gene expression may differ significantly at different stages of growth/infection  <cit> .

one possible scenario for the discordance in s. aureus gene expression during in vitro and in vivo growth is the absence of complex host/immune factors that act as environmental cues resulting in modulation of s. aureus gene expression. data generated from in vitro growth conditions have provided the wealth of knowledge that has given the scientific community the foundation required to understand the complex regulatory networks that modulate signaling/expression pathways. however, conclusions drawn from in vitro gene expression studies must be interpreted with caution as numerous details of the s. aureus transcriptome may differ significantly between in vitro and in vivo growth as our study attests. thus, effort must be made to measure virulence gene expression of signal transduction networks directly from infection models using approaches similar to the one described in this study if we are to identify vaccine targets relevant to infection.

an intriguing possibility of the features bestowed to usa <dig> strains to be successful may be related to increased emphasis on immune evasion during infection. this hypothesis is supported by the increased expression of Φsa3usa observed after infection with usa <dig> compared with usa <dig>  Φsa3usa encodes a number of immune evasion genes, including chips and staphylokinase  <cit> . there was also higher expression of the epidermin immunity protein operon in usa <dig> during infection, compared with usa <dig>  this cluster of genes has been previously associated with increased fitness of ca-mrsa strains due to its role in lantibiotic resistance. along these lines, there was higher expression of genes encoding urease subunits and metabolism in usa <dig> during infection compared with usa <dig>  these genes have been demonstrated to be induced during acid shock, and may serve as a mechanism to neutralize acidification of the phagolysosome and promote intracellular survival and fitness. therefore, usa <dig> may exploit increased urease activity under low ph, to neutralize the phagolysosomal compartment, allowing usa <dig> isolates to survive an acute immune response and may explain why usa <dig> is associated with persistent and recurrent infections. our hypothesis is supported by recent observation of a s. aureus strain that inhibits acidification of a phagolysosome following phagocytosis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our findings have important implications in the characterization of pathogenesis and virulence effectors in s. aureus. the discordant findings between the in vitro and in vivo settings suggest that studies to characterize s. aureus virulence should attempt to mimic the hostile host environment ; and must be comparatively analyzed with ex vivo and in vivo time-course models to fully reconstruct the arsenal of virulence factors and pathogenesis of s. aureus. complete understanding of the host-pathogen signal interaction during acute and persistent infections is critical for the treatment and prevention of ca-mrsa and all other s. aureus infections. in summary, there are differences in the genetic content of usa <dig> and usa <dig> strains. this is the first study to document the global transcription differences between usa <dig> and usa <dig> strains during both in vitro and in vivo growth.
