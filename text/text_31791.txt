BACKGROUND
third-generation cephalosporin-resistant  enterobacteriaceae represent a major threat in both hospital and community settings worldwide  <cit> . the resistance is mediated mainly by acquired extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  genes carried by mobile genetic elements such as plasmids and transposons. this situation is of great concern, as esbl enzymes can hydrolyse almost all beta-lactams  and are frequently associated with genes that confer resistance to several other classes of antibiotic. during the past decade, ctx-m enzymes have gradually replaced the classical tem and shv-type esbls in many countries  <cit> . rapid international spread of ctx-m- <dig> has been associated with global dissemination of escherichia coli clones, such as sequence type  <dig>  harbouring blactx-m- <dig> on incompatibility group  fii conjugative plasmids  <cit> .

plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance has emerged in enterobacteriaceae, with three mechanisms described: qnr, which mediates target protection; aac-ib-cr, which mediates drug modification; and oqxab and qepa, which mediate drug efflux  <cit> . these mechanisms increase the minimum inhibitory concentration  of fluoroquinolones, thereby facilitating the selection of mutants with greater resistance in the presence of quinolones through sequential chromosomal mutations in genes coding for the target enzymes, dna gyrase and dna topoisomerase iv  <cit> .

surgical-site infection is the most frequent health care-associated infection in the developing world, with a strikingly higher prevalence than in developed countries  <cit> . the alarming global burden of avoidable complications resulting from unsafe surgery has been highlighted by the world health organization  <cit> . few good-quality data are, however, available in africa on the phenotypic antimicrobial resistance of strains associated with surgical-site infections, and the mechanisms underlying antimicrobial resistance are unknown. we studied the prevalence of resistance to antibiotics in enterobacteriaceae isolates from surgical-site infections collected in three major tertiary care centres in bangui, central african republic; we also studied the genetic basis for antibiotic resistance and the genetic background of 3gc-r enterobacteriaceae.

RESULTS
patients, antibiotic prophylaxis, bacterial strains and antibiotic susceptibility
a total of  <dig> patients  with surgical-site infections were included during the study period in the general surgical departments of the complexe pédiatrique , the orthopaedics department of the community hospital , and the general surgery , gynaecology  and urology  departments of the amitié hospital. most of the operations were class i  in the altemeier classification, mainly with a pre-operative physical status score of i . the duration of most operations did not exceed 2 h . antibiotic prophylaxis was administered to  <dig> patients , most frequently consisting of beta-lactams , mainly ceftriaxon , penicillin g  and ampicillin .

of the  <dig> non-duplicate biological samples taken,  <dig> were culture positive . as  <dig> cultured specimens had mixed growth, a total of  <dig> bacterial isolates were collected. the bacteria isolated were e. coli , staphylococcus aureus , enterobacter cloacae , acinetobacter baumanii , klebsiella pneumoniae , pseudomonas aeruginosa , proteus mirabilis , morganella morganii , salmonella spp. , enterobacter aerogenes , enterobacter amnigenus , enterobacter sakazakii  and k. oxytoca .

neither p. aeruginosa nor a. baumanii was resistant to imipenem, whereas 9%  of s. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant, and  <dig> %  of enterobacteriaceae  were resistant to 3gc-r antibiotics. c3g-r enterobacteriaceae strains were resistant to all the beta-lactams tested, except for cefoxitin , and all were susceptible to ertapenem . in addition, they were characterized by high rates of resistance to netilmicin , kanamycin , gentamicin , tetracycline , ciprofloxacin  and cotrimoxazole , and a high rate of susceptibility to amikacin . the double-disc synergy test was positive for all strains. older patients were more susceptible to c3g-r enterobacteriaceae infection than younger ones  .table  <dig>

antibiotic resistance determinants and replicons in c3g-r enterobacteriaceae strains
the blactx-m- <dig> and aac-ib-cr genes were detected in all strains. of the  <dig>  qnr-positive strains,  <dig> were qnrb,  <dig> were qnrs and none were qnra, with  <dig> strains each harbouring  <dig> qnr genes.

rep-pcr, eric-pcr and multilocus sequence typing of c3g-r enterobacteriaceae
rep- and eric-pcr analysis showed  <dig> patterns for e. coli strains,  <dig> for enterobacter cloacae,  <dig> for k. pneumoniae and  <dig> for p. mirabilis. three clones were found in at least two surgical departments in the same hospital and six clones in at least two different tertiary care centres: two enterobacter cloacae clones, three k. pneumoniae clones and three e. coli clones .table  <dig>

aqepa was not found in any isolates.



six multilocus sts were found in the  <dig> e. coli isolates: st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig>  and st <dig>  . all the st <dig> isolates corresponded to the multi-resistant pandemic e. coli b2-o25b-st <dig> group.

resistance transfer determination of c3g-r strains
resistance transfer assays were performed on one strain randomly selected for each rep- and eric-pcr pattern. transfer of esbl by conjugation with e. coli j53- <dig> was successful for  <dig>  of the  <dig> esbl clones, which consisted of  <dig> e. coli isolates,  <dig> enterobacter cloacae and  <dig> enterobacter amnigenus. esbl transfer by plasmid dna electroporation into e. coli dh10b was successful for  <dig>  of the  <dig> remaining isolates: 2 k. pneumoniae isolates,  <dig> p. mirabilis and  <dig> enterobacter cloacae. the presence of blactx-m- <dig> and aac-ib-cr was confirmed by pcr in the  <dig> transconjugants and transformants . the plasmid harbouring the blactx-m- <dig> gene was systematically associated with aac-ib-cr, in contrast to qnr genes, as no qnrs and  <dig> %  of qnrb genes were co-transferred with blactx-m- <dig>  additional resistance genes  were probably transferred, as shown by antimicrobial susceptibility testing .table  <dig>

genetic support of resistance determinants
pcr-based replicon typing in the  <dig> transconjugants and transformants demonstrated the presence of plasmids of the incompatibility groups incf  and inchi <dig>  . the plasmid in two p. mirabilis isolates could not be typed. in the incompatibility group incf, identical replicon st were found in most isolates: f31:a4:b <dig>  and f36:a4:b <dig> . these two conjugative plasmids were found in strains collected from different hospitals. the other combinations were f1:a1:b <dig> , f1:a1:b <dig> , fnew:a-:b <dig>  and k4:-:b-  .

discussion
enterobacteriaceae strains were the microorganisms most frequently associated with surgical-site infections, of which  <dig>  were 3gc-r, as described previously in africa  <cit> . cross-transmission probably plays a major role, as suggested by the fact that patients in different surgery departments and different hospitals shared clonally related strains. this was the case not only for k. pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae strains, which are well known to be highly diffusible in hospital settings, especially in intensive care units  <cit> , but also for e. coli, in contrast to the situation in developed countries  <cit> . further investigations are needed to identify the mechanisms of transmission.

e. coli was the most frequent species among c3g-r enterobacteriaceae. the  <dig> isolates belonged to six sts, of which three corresponded to at least two rep- and eric-pcr patterns, namely st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig>  the pandemic e. coli b2-o25b-st <dig> group has contributed extensively to global dissemination of ctx-m- <dig>  <cit> , as has st <dig>  with the dispersal of both ctx-m- <dig> and ctx-m- <dig> group enzymes  <cit> . in addition, st <dig>  which is typical in the human gut but is also responsible for intestinal and extra-intestinal infections, was recently associated with dissemination of ctx-m- <dig>  ctx-m- <dig> and ctx-m- <dig> groups  <cit> . these data, combined with those from nigeria, south africa and tunisia  <cit> , show that dissemination of pandemic e. coli multi-drug resistant sts also occurs in african hospitals. the reasons for the wide dissemination and expansion of these clones are unknown but may include increased transmissibility, greater ability to colonize and/or persist in the intestinal tract, enhanced virulence and more extensive antimicrobial resistance than other e. coli  <cit> . the three minor sts have been described sporadically in humans and animals, associated with various ctx-m groups  <cit> : st <dig> in germany, st <dig> in france, great britain and portugal, and st <dig> in italy, portugal and spain. five of the isolates found in two hospitals in this study were assigned to the st <dig> genetic background, indicating its ability to spread.

plasmid typing showed that horizontal gene transfer by incf plasmid exchange was probably also involved in the dissemination of blactx-m- <dig>  the esbl blactx-m- <dig> gene was carried in all strains on plasmids of incf incompatibility groups, except in one enterobacter cloacae. incf plasmids were the most prevalent in e. coli and k. pneumoniae carrying esbl genes and also genes that confer resistance to tetracyclines, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. these plasmids can be considered pandemic, as they have been detected in different countries and in bacteria of different origins and sources. the occurrence of these plasmid types appears to be closely linked to positive selection exerted by antibiotic use, incrementing their prevalence over that in bacterial populations that are not preselected for antimicrobial resistance. their occurrence is also linked to virulence factors that contribute to the fitness of their bacterial host  <cit> . in the majority of isolates, including the three major e. coli sts, blactx-m- <dig> genes were found within incf conjugative plasmids, with identical replicon st formulae , two plasmids reported to be abundant in humans  <cit> . the f <dig> and f <dig> alleles differ by only a single point mutation. this, in the context of the diversity of the rep- and eric-pcr patterns of the isolates and their presence in different species and in different hospitals, suggests that horizontal transfer of plasmids is probably an important mechanism of blactx-m- <dig> spread, as described previously  <cit> . the dissemination of plasmids was probably preceded by the centre-to-centre transmission of several strains by patient transfer, as indicated by the identification by rep- and eric-pcr of closely related k. pneumoniae, e. coli and enterobacter cloacae isolates in at least two different hospitals.

various sets of antibiotic resistance genes within f31:a4:b <dig> and f36:a4:b <dig> plasmids indicate their capacity for gene rearrangement and their evolution into new variants. esbl blactx-m- <dig> and aac-ib-cr genes were inconsistently associated with qnrb on these plasmids and also with other resistance genes, as shown by antimicrobial susceptibility testing of transconjugants. this suggests the presence of a multidrug resistance region, as described for incfii plasmids pek <dig> and pek <dig> isolated in the united kingdom from the e. coli st <dig> group and for the pc15-1a plasmid disseminated in e. coli sts in canada  <cit> . further mapping of this region is needed. frequent association of blactx-m- <dig>  qnrb and aac-ib-cr genes has been described in k. pneumoniae isolates in north, west, central and east africa, consistent with the hypothesis that these resistance-determinant genes are carried together on the same plasmid  <cit> . such accumulation of resistance gene determinants on the same plasmid and their dissemination is a matter of concern, especially in countries with inadequate health care systems, because of the shortage of effective antibiotics and the consequences with respect to mortality, length of hospital stay and hospital costs. in addition, uncontrolled use of antimicrobial agents through self-medication, inappropriate antibiotic prescription and the substandard quality of some drugs favour the spread of antimicrobial resistance in these countries. the emergence of carbapenem resistance, which has been described in africa  <cit>  but was not found in our study, could be a serious challenge for infection control and antibiotic therapy in the future, as carbapenems are often the most effective antibiotics against 3gc-r enterobacteriaceae.

CONCLUSIONS
this study is of particular importance because of the difficulty of carrying out such studies in hospitals in countries with inadequate health care systems. our data suggest that diverse modes of transmission of resistance are involved, probably with a major role of plasmid dissemination. all necessary measures should be taken in african hospitals to prevent nosocomial infections and the selection of resistant bacteria, with efficient nosocomial infection surveillance programmes. standard hygiene and especially adherence to hand hygiene policies are the cornerstone for preventing transmission of multidrug-resistant bacteria.
