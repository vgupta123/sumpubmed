BACKGROUND
breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related death in women. it is estimated that one out of eight american women will develop breast cancer some time in their lifespan and  <dig> % will die from this disease  <cit> . for the year  <dig>  about  <dig>  new invasive breast cancer diagnoses and  <dig>  breast cancer related deaths are expected in the united states  <cit> . due to this high prevalence and severe consequences, genetic factors contributing to breast cancer risk have been intensively studied.

family history is known to be associated with 20% - 30% of breast cancer incidence in the united states  <cit> . pedigree analysis of clustered familial cases followed by positional cloning in the 1990s led to the discovery of tumor suppressor genes, brca <dig> <cit>  and brca <dig> <cit> , two major breast cancer susceptibility loci. deleterious mutations in these genes increase the risk of developing breast cancer by more than  <dig> fold and overall account for 15% - 30% of observed risks in familial breast cancer cases  <cit> . to discover breast cancer susceptibility alleles that constitute the remainder of genetic risk, genes associated with brca1/ <dig> pathways were investigated in brca1/ <dig> mutation negative familial cases. such candidate gene approaches revealed that germline mutations of tp <dig> <cit> , pten <cit> , atm <cit> , chek <dig> <cit> , brip <dig> <cit> , palb <dig> <cit> , nbs <dig> <cit>  and rad <dig> <cit>  are correlated with breast cancer risk, but to a much more moderate extent than brca <dig> and brca <dig>  therefore, new unbiased genomic approaches are needed for identifying genetic factors that influence breast cancer susceptibility.

over the last decade, advances in array technologies have resulted in the ability to evaluate the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously. these platforms offer a powerful tool to test multiple biomarkers for breast cancer tumorigenesis and prognosis, as well as targeted breast cancer therapy  <cit> . however, gene expression assessed by current techniques represents the total level of transcripts produced by both parental alleles. the absolute transcript level failed to resolve potential imbalances in relative allelic contribution to the total expression. this perspective is particularly important for familial breast cancers, where an individual inherits a germline mutation on one parental allele, followed by a somatic mutation of the second allele in the tumor cells. previously, we have reported that mutant brca <dig> transcripts containing premature stop codons were eliminated or destabilized by nonsense-mediated mrna decay   <cit>  and could lead to a state of haploinsufficiency. as a result, the ratio between the expressions from the wild-type allele and the corresponding mutant allele was significantly increased, resulting in what we coined differential allele-specific expression  or allelic imbalance   <cit> .

dase is a common phenomenon in human tissues  <cit> . although its contribution to breast cancer susceptibility has been implicated  <cit> , it has not been studied on a transcriptome-wide scale in breast cancer precursor tissues. since the phenomenon of dase at a locus may help identify nearby cis-acting transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory sites as well as mutations resulting in non-mediated rna decay  <cit> , we propose that dase is a sensitive functional index for genetic variants, and can be used as a novel approach to identify risk alleles for breast tumorigenesis. the main objectives of this study are to identify genes with dase by comparing the allele-specific expression  and to demonstrate that global dase analysis could be a powerful new approach to identify breast cancer risk alleles.

RESULTS
global dase profiling in hmecs
there have been successful applications of illumina’s infinium assay on global dase analysis  <cit>  since it provides genotyping results based on quantified fluorescent signal intensity of both alleles at a specific snp site  <cit> . the samples we used are paired gdnas and ds-cdnas derived from eight human mammary epithelial cell lines. in this study, we performed a transcriptome-wide dase analysis using illumina’s humanomni1-quad beadchip platform . among the total  <dig> , <dig> markers on the omni <dig> beadchip, we focused on snp markers representing transcribed regions of the female genome for global dase analysis. raw data from the array were filtered as described in the methods section for quality control purposes, and  <dig>  qualifying snps, representing  <dig>  transcribed loci crossing all eight samples, survived for the final dase analysis. the global dase pattern at each snp locus is shown as a circos plot in figure 1a . as shown in the dase distribution histogram , about 30% of loci are with a dase ≥  <dig>  which we used as the cut-off to define a locus with a positive dase event. this result is consistent with previous array studies which suggest dase is a relatively common event across the human genome  <cit> .

identification of candidate loci exhibiting significant dase
dase values of transcribed loci were calculated as described in the methods section. although a previous study successfully validated candidate loci exhibiting a fold change of  <dig>   <cit> , we raised the stringency by arbitrarily setting the dase value cut-off bar at  <dig>  equal to a 4-fold variance between alleles, to ensure the significance of the findings. by using snp-based calculation,  <dig> snps representing  <dig> transcribed genes showed statistical significance  . similarly, using gene-based calculation,  <dig> genes exhibited statistical significance  . however, each method presents some degree of limitation. for example, the snp-based dase measurement may only represent certain transcribed isoforms of a certain gene, and it is practically true when the targeted snps are located in the 5′ or 3′ utrs of this gene. for the gene-based approach, an outlier of dase value from one snp could have too much weight for final dase results. to decrease the chance for false positive “hits’, it is important that only gene candidates  discovered by both methods  were carried forward for further analysis.

*: only loci with dase ≥ 2; p ≤  <dig> ; and fdr ≤  <dig>  were included.

ingenuity pathway analysis  analysis revealed interaction networks within candidate dase loci
to help interpret the candidate dase loci in the context of biological processes, pathways and networks, ipa analyses were performed on our dase candidates. the result showed that  <dig> out of  <dig> protein coding loci are involved in known molecular interactions. among those interactions, there are two major networks. interestingly, one of the major networks covers  <dig> dase candidates, including cancer causative genes znf <dig> and usp <dig> and known breast cancer associated gene dmbt <dig>  and most of them are downstream players of sex hormones  and mmp pathways, suggesting their potential for being breast cancer risk alleles . in addition, ipa analysis also revealed a variety of biological functions that candidate dase loci are significantly associated with . the cellular functions of these genes are wide-ranging, including cell proliferation, cell death, and inflammation.

validating candidate dase loci by sanger sequencing
we utilized sanger sequencing to validate nine dase candidates in one major interaction network . in brief, regions flanking dase-associated snps were amplified by pcr followed by sequencing and comparing trace chromatograms between paired gdna and cdna samples. the dase value between two alleles in a sample of a given snp was evaluated by measuring the peak height of each allele in the chromograms originated from the cdna sample, justified by that originated from the genomic dna sample. figure 2c showed the examples of sequencing trace files in the validation of dase in znf <dig>  usp <dig>  and dmbt <dig>  a positive dase event by sequencing is defined when the height of the peak representing one allele is less than half of the peak height of the other allele. as summarized in table  <dig>  we clearly observed dase in  <dig> candidate loci by sequencing in  <dig> out of  <dig>  of samples with dase identified by global dase analysis. these results supported that our approach reported here to identify dase loci by high dense snp array is successful.

*: a positive dase event is defined when the ratio of ase levels from one allele to another allele is either more that  <dig> or less that  <dig> .

†: only two samples were able to be validated because of unsuccessful cdna sequencing at this locus for some samples.

§: dase were confirmed by sequencing in total  <dig> out of  <dig> samples whose cdna sequencings were successful.

identifying causative variants for dase in dmbt1
candidate dase locus dmbt <dig> was identified and validated by analyzing snp rs <dig> . a nearby snp, rs <dig>  in 5′utr region of dmbt <dig>  has been reported to be associated with increased breast cancer risk and rs2981745-t has decreased promoter activity compared with rs2981745-c  <cit> . since rs <dig> is not covered in the humanomni <dig> beadchip, we carried out additional genotyping across all eight hmecs and found rs <dig> heterozygous in  <dig> hmecs that are also heterozygous for rs <dig> . sequence analysis of dmbt <dig> 5′ race product revealed that rs11523871-c co-presents with rs2981745-a in all six hmecs, which suggests that dase observed in dmbt <dig> was caused by the loss of expression of rs2981745t allele . to examine if any variants in dmbt <dig> 3′ utr could also contribute to dase in dmbt <dig>  we fully sequenced 3′utr region in the genomic dnas of all  <dig> hmecs and identified two common snps, rs <dig> and rs <dig>  both presented in samples hmec- <dig> and − <dig> . we further sequenced the same regions in cdna products isolated from these two hmec lines. the results from hmec- <dig> are consistent with dase pattern discovered by analyzing heterozygous rs <dig> in this sample . importantly, the results from hemc- <dig>  in which both rs <dig> and rs <dig> are homozygous, revealed typical bi-allelic expression . we then used an online mirna targeting tool, probability of interaction by target accessibility   <cit> , to compare the effects of these variants on mirna binding, and only very subtle differences of mirna targeting were found among all genotype combinations . taken together, we concluded that in our study, variants in dmbt <dig> 3′utr region unlikely contribute to dase. our data suggested that rs <dig>  if not exclusively, appears to be one of the causative variants for dase in dmbt <dig> 

discussion
in our current study, we demonstrated transcriptome-wide dase analysis as a novel approach to identify breast cancer susceptibility loci. the humanomni1-quad beadchip we utilized has state of the art coverage of common snps on the human transcriptome. our study identified  <dig> candidate dase loci by both snp- and gene-based methods . pathway analysis reveals one major dase gene network which is likely associated with breast tumorigenesis . using pcr and sanger sequencing, we successfully validated the dase predictions in this breast cancer-related network, which includes cancer causative genes znf <dig> and usp <dig>  and breast cancer risk associated gene dmbt <dig> . by analyzing the 5′utr region of dmbt <dig>  we successfully identified rs <dig> as the causal variant for the dase in dmbt <dig> . therefore, we presented an example supporting our original expectation that dase analysis may lead to the discovery of functional dase-causing variants. dase in znf <dig> has possibly resulted from genomic imprinting as indicated from studies in human extraembryonic tissues  <cit> , but we are not able to verify such speculation for the lack of genetic material from parents. nevertheless, we reported for the first time about such phenomenon of znf <dig> in primary cultures of adult human tissue. we did not investigate further with the  <dig> non-coding dase candidate loci in current studies largely because very little information could be obtained to help interpret their roles. however, there have been a few studies denoting the importance of non-coding rnas in cellular processes during recent years  <cit> . considering the high percentage  of such loci in our candidate list, it is an important next step for us to validate non-coding candidate dase loci and study their likely roles in breast tumorigenesis.

as the illumina human omni1-quad array is originally designed for targeting genomic dna sequences instead of cdna sequences, intronic snps and many snps at the exon/intron boundary are left out for dase profiling. although the number of “usable” snps covers the majority of transcripts, the coverage could be further increased with newly developed platforms with additional snp markers. furthermore, the size of the probes on the illumina snp array is 50mer, and it is likely difficult for them to pick up small size transcripts, such as mirnas. therefore, it would be logical to consider designing customized beadchips covering pre-selected probes to improve both cost-effectiveness and specificity, and to reduce the data processing load for global dase profiling as well. in addition, we observed fluorescent interference between x and y channels during the data analysis due to the initial probe design  <cit> , and it was able to be alleviated by canonical data normalization. despite these limitations, infinium-based beadchip is still a practical platform for whole transcriptome dase analysis as indicated by the results of successful validation using sanger sequencing .

as mentioned in the introduction, currently known high and moderate penetrance risk alleles help only to explain a fraction of familial breast cancer incidents and the existence of more susceptibility genes are likely to be very rare. thus, it is plausible that the remaining cases could be complemented by the synergistic effects of multiple low penetrance alleles, each conferring an elevated risk of < <dig>  fold  <cit> . the completion of the human genome project and fast development of snp array technologies have made it practical to perform genome-wide association studies  to identify genetic factors that account for breast tumorigenesis. since the first wave of gwas to search for such alleles,  <dig> loci have been reported to significantly associate with breast cancer risk by  <dig> studies  <cit> . among those candidate risk loci, nearly half  were reproducible in multiple independent studies, which denotes the reliability of gwas prediction. despite these successes, the mechanisms of how these gwa variants affect breast cancer pathogenesis are often unknown, because in most cases it is not clear which gene are associated with gwa signals  <cit> . therefore, understanding the function of these breast cancer associated variants and the mechanisms of how they contribute to breast cancer is a logical next step to validate gwas findings. until now, most of them are merely snp tags for yet unknown breast cancer causal variants  <cit> . a couple of exceptions so far were rs2981582-a  <cit>  and rs1219648-g  <cit>  on fgf2r locus. the discovery of these two common low risk variants eventually pinpointed rs <dig> and rs <dig> as causal variants by genetic mapping and chip assay  <cit> . evaluation of the functional impact of putative causal variants identified by gwas could be very challenging as many gwa signals  map some distance from the nearest coding regions, and are likely to mediate disease predisposition through remote regulatory effects on transcription  <cit> . in addition, the causal alleles involved in breast cancer susceptibility are likely to have moderate molecular and cellular effects, and the measurable effects of an allele in a given functional assay may not exhibit a causal role in breast cancer pathogenesis by itself. therefore, novel strategies are required to functionally characterize the multiple gwa signals in a genome-wide manner for convincing genetic evidence. based on previous reports  <cit> , our study has pinpointed a likely causal variant for dase in dmbt <dig> . in addition, genetic mapping in mice has indicated that dmbt <dig> is a candidate modifier of mammary tumors and breast cancer risk  <cit> , and our results further support that allelic loss of expression in dmbt <dig> could contribute to breast cancer development, which is consistent with the reports from previous studies  <cit> . these findings support the idea that global dase profiling mapping could be a powerful approach to validate gwas findings when the dase loci map is overlapped with existing data from gwas  <cit> .

in our study, we have compared top dase loci identified in our genome-wide ase studies with the current cancer genome database provided by cancer gene census  and have identified two dase loci  listed as cancerous genes  <cit> . somatic mutations in usp <dig>  and in znf <dig>  have been reported in 1% of primary breast cancer and 2% of ovarian cancer, respectively  <cit> . these findings suggest that global dase profiling could be a powerful tool in combination with currently available cancer genome databases to identify novel breast cancer “driver” genes. furthermore, on-going cancer genome sequencing projects  have identified thousands of so-called variants of unknown/uncertain significance , including variations typically characterized by a single base change, or a change to several intronic bases. this large amount of vus data produced by the next generation sequencing-based cancer genome projects has been termed “overkill” from a clinical perspective  <cit> . currently, the consequence of most vus in oncogenesis has yet to be established. as dase is a sensitive functional index for pathogenic mutations, it can be applied for validating these vus at a genome-wide scale as well.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated for the first time that global dase analysis is a novel approach to identify breast cancer risk alleles. the results from our study are very promising and we expect our strategy will help validate the functional variants identified by the gwas and cancer genome projects. importantly, the research strategy developed here could be easily applied to investigating susceptibility for many other types of cancers.
