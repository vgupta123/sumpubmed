BACKGROUND
leucine rich repeat containing  <dig> , also known as glycoprotein a repetitions predominant , is a member of the leucine rich repeat family that exhibits evolutionary similarity to toll-like receptors  <cit> . it was initially localized to chromosome 11q13- <dig> but has since been further defined and mapped to the 11q <dig> - <dig> region  <cit> . the lrrc <dig> gene consists of two coding exons and is expressed as two different transcripts,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb in length  <cit> . the homologous mouse gene has been found in the 7f chromosomal region and shares high sequence homology to human lrrc <dig>  <cit> . the homologous gene in grass carp  shares 37% homology with human lrrc <dig>  and it has been found to contain transcription factor binding sites for ap <dig>  irf- <dig>  irf <dig>  irf- <dig>  and nfat, which are critical for the expression of many cytokines, suggesting a role for lrrc <dig> in the immune system  <cit> .

lrrc <dig> has been shown, via northern blot, to be expressed in placenta, lung, kidney, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas but not brain  <cit> . furthermore, lrrc <dig> mrna is also highly expressed in activated tregs and appears to mediate foxp <dig> expression, enabling tregs to suppress effector cell activation  <cit> . with respect to the structural aspects of lrrc <dig>  a sequence analysis of the human  <dig> amino acid protein product initially suggested that it was almost entirely extracellular, with  <dig> leucine rich repeats in the extracellular portion of the protein followed by a hydrophobic stretch of proteins thought to be a transmembrane domain, followed by a short cytoplasmic domain consisting of  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . sequence analysis by signalp  <dig>  revealed a putative n terminal signal peptide with a likely cleavage site after residue  <dig> of the pro-peptide. surface localization of this protein in transfected cells has been confirmed  <cit> . n-linked glycosylation has also been reported to play a role in post-translational processing of this protein  <cit> .

lrrc <dig> is expressed on the surface of expanded tregs, and il-2-expanded lrrc32-positive cd25hi cells are more suppressive than their il-2-expanded lrrc32-negative counterparts  <cit> . inhibition of lrrc <dig> expression using lentiviral or sirna strategies in expanded treg populations results in decreased suppressive capacity of the targeted cells  <cit> . the studies summarized above used previously-expanded tregs. therefore, they do not address the suppressive capacity of freshly isolated naturally-occurring lrrc32+ and lrrc32- subpopulations of cd25hi regulatory cells. although addition of tgf-β to lrrc32-cd25- cells induced foxp <dig> expression, lrrc <dig> was not upregulated, and cells treated in this manner were unable to suppress the proliferation of t effectors, suggesting that the upregulated expression of foxp <dig> was not sufficient to confer suppressive capacity on effector cells  <cit> . furthermore, over-expression of foxp <dig> on activated cd4+ t cells did not induce expression of lrrc <dig> on the cell surface  <cit> . finally, it has also recently been reported that lrrc <dig> binds latency-associated protein  and that surface expression of lap, in turn, is upregulated on activated tregs in conjunction with lrrc <dig> upregulation  <cit> . as previously reported, tregs may also use cell-surface bound transforming growth factor beta  to directly inhibit teff growth in a cell to cell contact dependent manner  <cit> .

naturally-occurring tregs are currently defined by the phenotypic expression of numerous surface markers including cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  gitr, ctla <dig>  and the intracellular transcription factor foxp <dig>  <cit> . since no single marker identifies the treg subset, the potential use of lrrc <dig> as an additional surface marker for potent tregs is of interest. we surmised that lrrc <dig> surface expression on tregs might have utility for the selection of tregs for functional studies as well as differentiation and activation studies. although previous studies have looked at the functional suppressive capacity of tregs that were expanded with cytokines such as il- <dig>  we chose to study the suppressive capacity of naturally-occurring freshly isolated activated tregs in the absence of long-term culture or repeated rounds of stimulation.

a previous study utilized a signal peptide deletion construct to show that naive t cells transfected with an lrrc <dig> signal peptide deletion construct lacked protein upregulation of cd <dig>  cd62l, and foxp <dig> compared to transfection with wildtype lrrc <dig>  <cit> . this study utilized gfp-tagged signal peptide deletion constructs that were transfected into hek <dig> cells to study the contribution of signal peptide to surface expression of lrrc <dig>  <cit> . surface expression was only evaluated by phase contrast and dapi confocal microscopy of single cells. these images suggested that some of the lrrc <dig> signal traffic to the cell surface, in contrast with our prediction. because experiments by wang et al. were unclear and did not conclusively show that deletion of the signal peptide region affects cell surface expression of conformationally intact native lrrc <dig> using antibodies capable of recognizing the extracellular domain of lrrc <dig>  we decided to characterize the functional and phenotypic properties of tregs expressing lrrc <dig> by immunuohistochemistry.

we show that lrrc <dig> is a marker for a more potent subset of freshly isolated activated tregs. we further characterize treg subsets with respect to the expression of other treg markers in the context of lrrc <dig> expression. we examine the intracellular processing of lrrc <dig> and conclusively demonstrate in multiple cells that the n-terminal portion of lrrc <dig> is cleaved prior to expression of the protein on the cell surface and that cleavage of this signal peptide is necessary for translocation of the mature protein to the cell surface. furthermore, we directly confirm, using antibodies specific for native lrrc <dig>  that the signal peptide region of lrrc <dig> is critical for its surface expression. we also demonstrate low levels of intracellular lrrc <dig> prior to activation via the t cell receptor  and cd <dig>  suggesting that low levels of lrrc <dig> are sequestered intracellularly and that t cell activation is necessary for the synthesis and surface expression of lrrc <dig>  expression of lrrc <dig> may enhance treg function. therefore, refinement of immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at targeting lrrc <dig> may improve strategies for treg isolation and yield more potent tregs.

methods
isolation of cd4+ cells
peripheral blood was donated by healthy human volunteers coordinated by the skin diseases research center at university hospitals case medical center. signed informed consents were obtained from volunteers prior to their participation in the study. the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of university hospitals case medical center. peripheral blood mononuclear cells  were prepared by histopaque- <dig>  density gradient separation in accordance with manufacturer's protocols. negatively selected cd4+ t cells were purified using magnetic bead technology, per manufacturer's instructions .

generation of constructs
plasmid dna encoding the cdna of full length human lrrc <dig> protein  was used to transform competent one shot top  <dig> e. coli , according to the manufacturer's instructions. selection of positive clones was performed on kanamycin  lb agar plates. plasmids were recovered and purified using a qiaquick maxiprep purification kit . the following primers encoding regions flanking the entire lrrc <dig> sequence were used to amplify the lrrc <dig> cdna sequence via pcr and insert a topo cloning site for pentr/d-topo : pcmv6-lrrc <dig> reverse , pcmv6-lrrc <dig> reverse readthrough , and pcmv6-lrrc <dig> forward .

the following 1x pcr buffer conditions were used: accuprime pfx 1x reaction buffer ,  <dig> mm of forward primer,  <dig> mm of reverse or reverse readthrough primer,  <dig> ng of template dna, and  <dig> unit of accuprime pfx dna . pcr conditions were as follow: initial denaturation at  <dig> c for  <dig> minutes followed by  <dig> cyles of denaturation, annealing, and extension at  <dig> c,  <dig> c, and  <dig> c for  <dig> s,  <dig>  and  <dig> minutes, respectively, followed by final extension at  <dig> c for  <dig> minutes.

pcr products containing the lrrc <dig> sequence derived from reactions utilizing either the forward and reverse primers or forward and reverse readthrough primers were then inserted into pentr/d-topo, per the manufacturer's instructions to generate two different respective constructs: pentr/d-topo/c-terminus lrrc <dig>  and pentr/d-topo/n-terminus lrrc <dig> . one shot top  <dig> e. coli were transformed as described above, and positive clones were selected using lb agar plus kanamycin plates. plasmid dna was isolated using a qiaquick miniprep  kit, and m <dig> forward and reverse primers were subsequently used to facilitate sequencing of the inserted pcr products within each of the screened and purified plasmids via the sequencing core at case western reserve university. the reported sequence was aligned with the reported cdna sequence of lrrc <dig> obtained from origene using the vector nti  software system, and sequence alignments were then confirmed prior to further utilization of the lrrc <dig> sequence-verified plasmids.

lrrc <dig> sequence-verified pentr/d-topo/n-terminus lrrc <dig> or pentr d-topo/c-terminus lrrc <dig> plasmids were then used in a gateway  cloning strategy utilizing either the vivid colors pcdna <dig> /n-emgfp or pcdna <dig> /c-emgfp  as destination vectors, per manufacturer's instructions to generate two products, pcdna <dig>  n-terminus lrrc32/c-emgfp and pcdna <dig>  c-terminus lrrc32/n-emgfp, encoding "c-gfp/lrrc32" and "n-gfp/lrrc32" respect-ively. products were used to transform one shot top  <dig> e. coli., and selection of positive clones was performed on lb agar plus ampicillan plates. purified plasmids derived from expanded clones were screened again using restriction enzyme analysis to confirm expected restriction sites in the sequence.

to generate an lrrc <dig> signal peptide deletion construct, we utilized the newly created pcdna <dig>  c-terminus lrrc32/n-emgfp vector as a template for pcr amplification. the pcmv6-lrrc <dig> reverse readthrough primer, described above, as well as a newly created pcmv6-lrrc32Δsp primer , designed to anneal optimally to bases just distal to the presumed signal peptide cleavage site of lrrc <dig>  were utilized to generate a pcr product containing the lrrc <dig> sequence without a putative signal peptide sequence. the pcr product was then inserted into pentr/d-topo, and an identical strategy as that described above was utilized to create a pcdna <dig>  n-terminus lrrc32Δsp/c-emgfp product coding for a lrrc <dig> signal peptide deletion construct  tagged at the c-terminus end with gfp. the primer "c-emgfp topo internal rev"  was utilized to confirm that the gfp and lrrc <dig>  coding regions were in frame.

realtime pcr analysis
rna was extracted using the rneasy kit .  <dig> ng of total rna was then processed using the superscript iii first-strand synthesis system  and random hexamers as primers and to generate cdna, per manufacturer's protocol. the following gene expression assays were subsequently used for rt-pcr analysis: foxp <dig> , lrrc <dig> , 18s , and gfp . rt-pcr analysis was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's suggested protocol  with an applied biosystems  <dig> realtime pcr system, and stepone  <dig>  analysis software was used to analyze the data.

transfection of and establishment of stable cell lines
hek <dig> cells  were transfected with plasmid containing either pentr d-topo/c-terminus lrrc <dig>  or n-terminus lrrc <dig> , utilizing a 3: <dig> ratio of fugene  <dig>  to plasmid  according to the manufacturer's protocol. stable transfectants were selected using blastocidin  according to the manufacturer's protocol, and individual cells were sorted based upon their gfp expression using a facs aria cell sorting system  into  <dig> well plates. stable clones expressing n-gfp/lrrc <dig>  c-gfp/lrrc <dig>  or c-gfp/lrrc32Δsp were thus derived from sorted single cells with the highest gfp expression.

biotinylation of cell surface proteins, immunoprecipitation and western blotting
sulfo-nhs-lc-biotin  was utilized to label cell surface proteins, in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. biotinylated cells were lysed in glo lysis buffer  per manufacturer protocols. gfp-tagged proteins derived from the cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-gfp  using an exactacruz e system, per manufacturer's instructions . immunoprecipitated proteins were electrophoresed on precast nupage gels  with their corresponding premade mops sds buffers . proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride  membranes , per manufacturer's protocol, for subsequent probing using anti-gfp antibody  or isotype control antibody . a supersignal pico  kit containing hrp-coupled rabbit anti-mouse antibody was used for detection of gfp-tagged proteins. hrp-coupled goat polyclonal to mouse igg  was also used to recognize bound murine antibody. rabbit polyclonal antibodies to foxp <dig>  were used to probe for human foxp <dig> on membranes, and hrp-coupled goat polyclonal antibodies to rabbit igg were used to recognize bound rabbit antibodies. for detection of biotinylated proteins, streptavidin-hrp  was utilized.

for the assessment of cellular lrrc <dig> expression in the context of the signal peptide deletion constructs, an identical protocol as above was used except that cells were lysed using the m-per mammalian protein extraction reagent . plato- <dig> was used to detect lrrc <dig>  and the pierce fast western blot kit  was used to visualize immunoblots.

flow cytometry analysis of cd4+ cells
cd4+ cells were placed in culture media  and rested overnight in 96-well plates or stimulated in anti-cd3-coated plates supplemented with soluble murine anti-human cd <dig>   <cit> . cells were subsequently stained using antibodies to cd <dig> , lrrc <dig> , foxp <dig> , and a panel of antibodies specific for cd <dig> , cd62l , gitr , ctla <dig> , hla-dr , and cd45ro , per manufacturer's protocol for staining cells for flow cytometry . cells were fixed and then permeabilized using a fixation permeabilization kit  after staining surface antigens in order to study the intracellular expression of certain proteins . for assessment of intracellular expression of lrrc <dig>  permeabilized cells were incubated with  <dig>  micrograms/ml of igg2b control isotype antibody  for  <dig> minutes prior to incubation with labeled anti-lrrc <dig> antibody to decrease non-specific binding. isotype controls were performed for compensation. cells were analyzed on a becton dickenson lsr ii flow cytometer. in all instances, with the exception of the mrna studies, cd25hi cells represented the top 5% of cd25+ cells. in the case of the mrna studies in which cd25hi and mid populations were identified, cd25hi++ cells represented the top  <dig> % of cd25+ cells, and cd25hi+ cells represented the next highest 2-3% of cd25+ cells as depicted in figure 1a.

expansion and stimulation of tregs
cd4+ cells were isolated as described above. subsequently, the cells were stained with anti-cd <dig> . the top 5% of cd25hi cells were sorted, and cells were expanded and stimulated for  <dig> weeks using beads coated with anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> according to manufacturer directions  prior to characterization. unstimulated sorted cd25hi cells derived from isolated cd4+ cells from the same patient were used as a control for unsimulated tregs.

proliferation assay
negatively selected cd4+ cells were stained with anti-cd <dig>  and the top 5% of cd <dig> cells  were sorted using a becton dickenson facs aria cell sorter. isolated cells were stimulated overnight on anti-cd3-coated plates  supplemented with soluble murine anti-human cd <dig>  as described above. cd25- effector t cells were maintained in culture media. stimulated cd25hi cells were subsequently stained with antibody specific for lrrc <dig> , and lrrc32+ and lrrc32- subpopulations were further sorted. lrrc32+ positive and lrrc32- treg subpopulations were then co-cultured with cd25- effector t cells plus irradiated allogeneic antigen presenting cells  at various treg:teff ratios ranging from 1: <dig> to 1: <dig> in a  <dig> well round bottomed tissue culture plate  as previously described  <cit> . each well contained  <dig>  teffs and  <dig>  apcs which had been previously irradiated at  <dig>  rad. mixed lymphocytes were cultured for  <dig> days, and cells were pulsed with  <dig> μci/well thymidine  for the last  <dig> h. proliferation was measured using a topcount scintillation counter . maximum proliferation was calculated by measuring the proliferation of cells in wells lacking tregs and containing only teffs and apcs. background proliferation was ascertained via measurement of proliferation of teffs only in the absence of apcs.

statistical analysis
statistical analysis was performed using student's t test  or a three way anova  as indicated in the figure legends. a value of p =  <dig>  was considered significant, unless otherwise indicated.

for the anova, the overall p value reported is reflective of the difference between the average proliferation of tregs using lrrc <dig> as an independent variable while controlling for the individual assays as well as the titration. the r <dig> value represents the amount of variability in the anova analysis that is accounted for by the presence or absence of lrrc <dig> on the surface of a treg, the individual assays, as well as the titration.

RESULTS
lrrc <dig> is preferentially expressed in tregs
a preliminary microarray analysis demonstrated upregulated lrrc <dig> gene expression in tregs  <cit> . to confirm these findings, we performed rt pcr analysis examining lrrc <dig> mrna expression in sorted subpopulations of cd25-expressing cells as depicted  representing  <dig> % of the cd4+ cell population with the highest expression of cd <dig> , 2-3% of the cd4+ cell population with high expression of cd <dig> , 17-20% of the cd4+ cell population with reduced expression of cd <dig> , or no expression of cd <dig> . these analyses revealed that lrrc <dig> expression increased with surface cd <dig> expression in a manner similar to foxp <dig> expression , confirming that lrrc <dig> is preferentially expressed in tregs. to confirm that lrrc <dig> is specifically upregulated in activated tregs, we compared the surface expression of lrrc <dig> in the cd25hi population and the cd25- teff population of cd4+ cells stimulated overnight with plate bound anti-cd <dig> and soluble anti-cd <dig> and found that lrrc <dig> is preferentially expressed on the surface of activated tregs but not activated teffs , in accordance with a previous study  <cit> . furthermore, in accordance with this previous study, we also confirmed that surface lrrc <dig> is present on sorted cd4+cd25hi tregs representing 5% of the cd4+ cell population with the highest expression of cd <dig>  that had been activated for  <dig> weeks with beads coated with anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> but not on unstimulated sorted cd4+cd25hi tregs   <cit> . a low intracellular expression of lrrc <dig> in resting sorted cd4+cd25hi tregs was noted . this suggests that low levels of lrrc <dig> may be sequestered in tregs or might require additional processing prior to surface expression. increased expression of lrrc <dig> could be seen in activated cd4+cd25hi sorted tregs that had been permeabilized  and was higher than that seen on the surface only , as would be expected for a surface protein that is initially produced intracellularly upon cell activation before trafficking to the cell surface.

lrrc <dig> is cleaved after processing
sequence analysis of murine lrrc <dig> predicted that lrrc <dig> would be expressed as a transmembrane protein  <cit> . we analyzed the sequence of human lrrc <dig> using the transmembrane domain prediction server at stockholm bioinformatics center with a dense alignment method and confirmed the existence of a putative  <dig> amino acid transmembrane domain incorporating residues  <dig> through  <dig> , in agreement with prior reports that this protein was expressed at the cell surface  <cit> . using the signalp  <dig>  server, we also identified a putative  <dig> amino acid signal peptide sequence and cleavage site between residues  <dig> and  <dig> , consistent with the requirement for a signal peptide to be present in a protein destined for expression at the cell surface  <cit> . to further understand protein processing and surface expression of human lrrc <dig>  we generated lrrc <dig> constructs incorporating green fluorescent protein  at either the n- or c- terminus, thereby allowing us to examine the tagged signal peptide or the mature protein, respectively . using anti-gfp antibodies, we examined total lysates from hek-transfected c- and n- terminus tagged lrrc32-expressing clones . here, we show that 99kd  and  <dig> kd  fusion proteins, respectively, are generated in hek transfectants overexpressing lrrc <dig>  consistent with a cleaved n-terminus signal peptide generated prior to surface expression of lrrc <dig> 

lrrc <dig> on transfected hek <dig> cells is expressed at the cell surface regardless of stimulation
although tregs appear to require activation prior to expressing lrrc <dig> on their surface, the same is not true for transfected cell lines such as hek <dig>  and the use of the hek <dig> cell line allowed us to easily study factors affecting the surface expression of lrrc <dig> in a system that would not require constant t cell isolation and activation  <cit> . we used c- and n-terminal gfp-tagged lrrc <dig>  expressing hek <dig> cell clones for surface biotinylation and analysis. following surface biotinylation, cell lysates were prepared and anti-gfp antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate the fusion proteins. precipitated protein was transferred to a pvdf membrane. the membrane was then probed for biotin using streptavidin-hrp  or for gfp using an anti-gfp antibody . our results demonstrate biotinylated surface protein only in c-gfp/lrrc32-expressing clones , consistent with both surface membrane expression of lrrc <dig> and intracellular n-terminal processing  prior to membrane localization. probing the membrane with anti-gfp  demonstrates the surface and intracellular portions of lrrc <dig> after cleavage.

confocal studies with c-terminal gfp-tagged lrrc <dig> -transfected hek <dig> cells confirm that gfp expression is found on the cell surface without stimulation, in accordance with predictions that lrrc <dig> would be found on the cell surface . in contrast, n-terminal gfp-tagged lrrc <dig> -transfected hek <dig> cells exhibit gfp expression diffusely within cells, and gfp expression is not concentrated at cell surfaces, presumably since the gfp-tagged cleaved signal peptide of n-gfp/lrrc <dig> remains intracellularly after cleavage, prior to the translocation of the mature lrrc <dig> protein to the cell surface . antibody staining of surface lrrc <dig> confirmed that mature c-gfp/lrrc <dig> and n-gfp/lrrc <dig> traffic to the cell surface . our untransfected control cell line did not express gfp or lrrc <dig> staining, as expected . furthermore, our c-terminal gfp-tagged chloramphenicol acetyltransferase  control cell line did not express lrrc <dig> staining, as expected .

a putative signal peptide region corresponding to the first  <dig> amino acids of lrrc <dig> is required for surface protein expression of lrrc32
since signal peptides are generally necessary to direct surface expression of proteins, we next decided to see whether deletion of the putative signal peptide region would inhibit surface expression of lrrc <dig>  <cit> . hek <dig> cells transfected with a c-terminus gfp-tagged lrrc <dig> construct lacking the signal peptide  did not express surface lrrc <dig> by confocal microscopy . furthermore, they did not express surface lrrc <dig> by flow cytometry but were gfp positive, compared to hek <dig> cells transfected with the full length c-terminus gfp-tagged lrrc <dig> construct, expressing both gfp and surface lrrc <dig> . control untransfected cells did not express gfp or surface lrrc <dig>  as expected .

given the absence of surface expression of lrrc <dig> in cells transfected with c-gfp/lrrc32Δsp, we concluded that the signal peptide portion of lrrc <dig> was critical for surface expression of lrrc <dig>  it was unclear, however, whether the absence of surface expression of lrrc <dig> was due to intracellular sequestration of lrrc <dig>  we therefore conducted a western blot analysis of lysates from hek <dig> cells transfected with our various constructs using an anti-lrrc <dig> antibody. our results showed that while lrrc <dig> can be detected in cell lysates from cells transfected with full-length lrrc <dig> constructs , lrrc <dig> could not be detected in cell lysates of hek <dig> cells transfected with the c-gfp/lrrc32Δsp, suggesting that lrrc <dig> is either produced at levels that were undetectable or is rapidly broken down following translation .

to confirm that lrrc <dig> was being transcribed, we utilized rt-pcr to analyze mrna from lysates of hek <dig> cells transfected with our various constructs. our analysis showed that lrrc <dig> mrna was detected in the c-gfp/lrrc <dig> as well as the c-gfp/lrrc32Δsp-transfected hek <dig> cell lysates . in contrast, untransfected hek <dig> cells as well as the control c-terminus tagged chloramphenicol acetyltransferase -transfected hek <dig> cell lysates had undetectable levels of lrrc <dig> mrna. furthermore, as expected, gfp expression was observed in all of the hek <dig> transfected cells examined . as we utilized stable clones derived from sorted single cells with the highest gfp expression, as described above, the different efficiencies of c-gfp/lrrc <dig> vs. c-gfp/lrrc32Δsp may be due to differential stability/integration of the plasmids in the selected clones. furthermore, it is possible that the signal peptide mutant may be less stable, and as a result, cells transfected with gfp/lrrc32Δsp may compensate by producing more mrna to produce more protein.

characterization of cd62l expression and functional status of lrrc32+ and lrrc32- naturally-occurring freshly isolated human tregs
using polyclonal activation via the tcr in combination with anti-cd <dig> co-stimulation, we confirmed that lrrc <dig> is expressed on the surface of naturally-occurring freshly-isolated activated tregs compared to unstimulated tregs  vs.  <dig> % ±  <dig> % , data not shown), respectively. we subsequently confirmed that surface lap expression is also observed in this cell population following activation with plate-bound anti-cd <dig> and soluble anti-cd <dig>  in agreement with a recently published report   <cit> .

to date, no single surface marker is sufficient for identifying naturally-occurring tregs. in order to address the expression of lrrc <dig> in the context of previously described surface markers, we analyzed lrrc32+ and lrrc32- subsets of cd4+cd25hifoxp3+lrrc32+ tregs, as well as unactivated tregs, with respect to the surface co-expression of cd62l, cd45ro, cd <dig>  gitr, ctla <dig>  and hla-dr . stimulated tregs demonstrated expected increases in the surface expression of gitr, cd <dig>  and ctla <dig>  of interest, however, stimulated lrrc32+ tregs exhibited less cd62l and cd45ro than resting and stimulated lrrc32- tregs, suggesting that lrrc32+ tregs may represent a subset of activated or differentiated tregs.

to address whether or not functional differences in lrrc32+ and lrrc32- subsets of naturally-occurring freshly isolated tregs exist, we examined the suppressive capacity of lrrc32+ and lrrc32- tregs. given previous reports that transfection of lrrc32-bearing constructs into "pre-regulatory t cells" could induce them to upregulate foxp <dig> expression, we hypothesized that the lrrc32+ subset of naturally-occurring freshly-isolated cd4+cd25hi tregs would be more suppressive than the lrrc32- subset of cd4+cd25hi tregs  <cit> . as described above, our data demonstrates that lrrc <dig> expression comports with foxp3+ expression. therefore, we first sorted cd25hi cd4+-purified cells and then activated these and sorted again for tregs expressing surface lrrc <dig>  isolated lrrc32+ or lrrc32- tregs were then used in mixed lymphocyte response assays to assess the relative suppressive capabilities of each isolated population of tregs. our results confirmed that naturally-occurring freshly-isolated lrrc32+ tregs are more suppressive than lrrc32- tregs , exhibiting significant increases in suppression at treg:teff ratios of 1: <dig>  1: <dig>  and 1: <dig> .

discussion
the isolation of naturally-occurring functional tregs will be a prerequisite for successful adoptive immunotherapy techniques in humans. murine adoptive immunotherapy models have demonstrated proof of concept that isolated tregs can be used as therapy for several autoimmune disorders  <cit> . the isolation of functional tregs in humans, however, is problematic, in part due to a paucity of specific surface markers. in this report, we demonstrate direct evidence of the surface expression of lrrc <dig> on freshly-isolated, naturally-occurring, and non-expanded cd4+ cd25hi human tregs following tcr activation. we furthermore have characterized lrrc <dig> processing and demonstrate that sorted subsets of freshly isolated tregs bearing this marker appear more suppressive than subsets lacking this marker.

previous studies have shown that constitutive over-expression of lrrc <dig> in cd25- teffs can lead to foxp <dig> upregulation and that these cells subsequently acquire a suppressive phenotype  <cit> . similarly, overexpression of foxp <dig> has been shown to result in increased mrna levels of lrrc <dig>  suggesting positive feedback between foxp <dig> and lrrc <dig>  <cit> . although other groups have shown that surface lrrc <dig> is highly elevated in expanded activated tregs compared to cd25- teffs, we demonstrate here that low levels of intracellular lrrc <dig> are detectable in naturally-occurring freshly-isolated unstimulated tregs   <cit> .

previous studies utilizing an antibody generated against amino acids 296- <dig> of lrrc <dig> failed to detect lrrc <dig> on transfected jurkat cells or on native cd4+cd25hitregs  <cit> . however, as shown here, a commercially available anti-lrrc <dig> monoclonal antibody does recognize surface lrrc <dig> on transfected heks and naturally-occuring freshly-derived tregs that have undergone stimulation. furthermore, it detects low intracellular expression of lrrc <dig> in naturally-occurring freshly-derived tregs. failure to detect surface lrrc <dig> by the antibody raised against peptide 296- <dig> may be due to competitive occupation by a ligand as this region of lrrc <dig> corresponds to a loop and has been hypothesized to correspond to a ligand binding site  <cit> . one proposed ligand that could occupy this site may be lap, as recently published work has demonstrated an interaction between lap and lrrc <dig>  <cit> . if residues 296- <dig> of lrrc <dig> act as a binding site for lap, occupation of this site may account for the failure of previous lrrc32-specific antibodies to recognize surface lrrc <dig> expression.

to determine if lrrc <dig> is sequestered in tregs, we examined the intracellular expression of lrrc <dig> in naturally-occurring freshly-isolated unstimulated tregs by flow cytometry. we show that unstimulated tregs contain low levels of intracellular lrrc <dig> protein. however, coupled with our rt-pcr studies showing high levels of lrrc <dig> mrna in unstimulated tregs relative to teffs, these data suggest that post-transcriptional mechanisms may play a role in controlling lrrc <dig> production and expression in non-activated tregs. such post-transcriptional controls may be diminished upon stimulation via tcr/cd <dig> signaling, as indeed, upon stimulation, evidence of increased intracellular lrrc <dig> protein was evident in tregs as assessed by flow cytometry .

in addition, our signal peptide deletion construct studies reveal that the putative signal peptide in lrrc <dig> is critical for the cell surface expression of lrrc <dig>  consistent with other reports that signal peptides are necessary for surface protein expression  <cit> . our data showing that lrrc32Δsp is transcribed  but not detected intracellularly  suggest that lrrc32Δsp is rapidly broken down in the cytosol or is not translated at detectable levels following transcription. however, mechanisms for the rapid degradation of misfolded proteins exist to maintain cell viability, and as such, cytosolic lrrc32Δsp, unable to enter the endoplasmic reticulum owing to the lack of a signal peptide, may be translated but rapidly degraded afterwards by processes such as ubiquitination  <cit> .

finally, using freshly isolated, non-expanded cd4+cd25hilrrc32+ tregs, we show that such cells expressing surface lrrc <dig> appear to be functionally more suppressive than cd4+cd25hilrrc32- tregs. previous reports have shown that upon activation of teffs, surface cd62l is usually decreased  <cit> . however, tregs normally maintain cd62l expression and functional phenotype  <cit> . furthermore, previous reports have shown that cd62l+cd4+cd25hi tregs are more suppressive than their cd62l- counterparts  <cit> .we show here that expression of surface cd62l appears to decrease significantly on lrrc32+ tregs compared to lrrc32- treg populations.

differences in cd62l processing may be responsible for the observed difference in cd62l expression between lrrc32+ and lrrc32- activated tregs. it has been shown that 90% of cd62l is rapidly cleaved from the surface within  <dig> hours of t cell activation prior to increasing over the next  <dig> hours, due to enhanced message stability, before ultimately decreasing due to downregulation of gene transcription  <cit> . furthermore, it has been reported that cd62l is rapidly shed in t cells, including tregs, after activation  <cit> . in accordance, our data show that unstimulated lrrc32- cd4+cd25hifoxp3+ tregs expressed more surface cd62l than stimulated lrrc32+ or lrrc32- cd4+cd25hifoxp3+ tregs. however, upon activation, decreases in surface cd62l expression of lrrc32+ versus lrrc32- cells were noted, suggesting that lrrc32+ cells are more activated compared to lrrc32- tregs. given that an overnight stimulation is sufficient to induce lrrc <dig> expression on the cell surface of tregs, we chose this as our timepoint for phenotypic analysis. however, altering the time course of stimulation may also alter surface treg marker expression.

activated tregs that express lrrc <dig> may also represent a distinct population of more highly activatable tregs compared to lrrc32- tregs  <cit> . indeed, our phenotypic studies using lrrc32+ and lrrc32- subsets of tregs in the context of cd62l expression would appear to support the interpretation that lrrc32+ tregs, relative to lrrc32- tregs, are more prone to activation, as shown by increased cleavage of surface cd62l, and that this more highly activated state may translate into increased suppressive activity. notably, although only a fraction of tregs expressed lrrc <dig> upon activation overnight, these cells appeared to be more functionally suppressive than their lrrc32- counterparts.

most natural foxp3+ adult tregs are cd45ro+, and the expression of cd45ro is typically a marker of t cell activation  <cit> . as lrrc32+ tregs appear to be more suppressive than lrrc32- tregs, it is possible that lower expression of cd45ro on lrrc32+ tregs relative to lrrc32- tregs may be due to increased auto-suppressive activity by lrrc32+ tregs compared to lrrc32- tregs. as noted above, stimulated tregs demonstrated expected increases in the surface expression of gitr, cd <dig>  and ctla <dig>  gitr, or glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor, was originally shown to be highly expressed on unactivated tregs but relative to teffs, and its expression was increased upon cell activation  <cit> . it appears that gitr is a co-stimulatory molecule, and although it is preferentially expressed on cd25hi cells, it is also expressed at lower levels on teffs, and upon activation, teffs can also upregulate gitr  <cit> . hence, the use of gitr as a specific marker for tregs appears to be limited. cd <dig> has been described in the context of a cd69+cd4+cd25- treg subset that does not express foxp <dig> but does express surface-bound tgf-β <dig> in an erk-dependent manner  <cit> . normally, cd <dig> is upregulated upon t cell activation, and thus expected on our tregs  <cit> . since lrrc <dig> also binds lap, thereby helping to concentrate tgf-β <dig> at the cell surface, it is interesting to speculate whether cd <dig> in tregs may play a role in helping to upregulate tgf-β <dig> surface expression in the context of lrrc <dig> when the latter is available. although our data did not find any significant differences in the cd <dig> expression in stimulated lrrc32+ and lrrc32- treg subsets , it is possible that part of the reason for the observed difference in suppressive activity between the lrrc32+ and lrrc- treg subsets may be in part due to synergy between cd <dig> and lrrc <dig> via increased surface expression of tgf-β <dig>  ctla <dig>  or cytotoxic t lymphocyte antigen- <dig>  can inhibit teff activation via 1) binding b <dig>  and b <dig> , thereby depriving cd <dig> on teffs of the ability to bind these co-stimulatory ligands, 2) inhibiting il- <dig> transcription and progression of cells through the cell cycle via inhibition of cyclin d <dig>  cdk <dig>  and cdk <dig> production, and 3) decreasing the amount of time the tcr is engaged  <cit> . as we did not see any significant differences in ctla <dig> expression in the lrrc32+ and lrrc32- treg subsets, we do not have data to suggest that differences in ctla <dig> expression might have contributed to the observed differences in suppressive function in the lrrc32+ and lrrc32- treg subsets. clearly, the results in this set of experiments raise many more interesting questions and suggest that the role of lrrc <dig> in the context of these other cell activation markers is complex.

previous studies examining lrrc <dig> and t cell regulation have utilized teffs transfected with constructs containing either wildtype lrrc <dig> or lrrc <dig> lacking leucine rich repeat regions, the signal peptide, the cytoplasmic domain, or lrrc <dig> with a mutated cytoplasmic residue postulated to be part of a pdz domain and thus thought to bind an intracellular protein  <cit> . these experiments were performed to address how lrrc <dig> may be processed and ultimately function in treg cells. pdz domain mutation studies have suggested that the intracellular portion of lrrc <dig> is critical for surface expression, and other studies examined the lrrc <dig> deletion mutants in the context of downstream effector molecules such as foxp <dig>  <cit> . these studies concluded that because foxp <dig> expression was markedly decreased upon deletion of the leucine rich regions or the signal peptide, these regions were critical for lrrc <dig> function  <cit> . however, these studies never demonstrated actual cleavage of the putative signal peptide  <cit> . here, we demonstrate via immunoprecipitation and confocal studies that lrrc <dig> encodes a signal peptide that is cleaved, and upon cleavage, allows mature lrrc <dig> to reach the cell surface.

it is likely that the lrrc <dig> signal peptide is cleaved from the newly translocated preprotein by type i eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum signal peptidase, based upon the amino acid sequence of lrrc <dig>  <cit> . the initial amino acid sequence of lrrc <dig> incorporating a charged n-terminal domain followed by a hydrophobic domain is consistent with published reports of the consensus motif for eukaryotic type i endoplasmic reticulum signal peptidase  <cit> . furthermore, the sequence g-l-a at positions  <dig> though  <dig> of the preprotein is consistent with the - <dig>  - <dig> rule, stating that residues at the - <dig> and - <dig> positions, relative to the cleavage site, must be neutral and have small side chains  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have demonstrated a cleaved signal peptide site in lrrc <dig> is necessary for surface localization of native lrrc <dig> following activation of naturally-occurring freshly-isolated regulatory t cells. we show that lrrc32+ cd4+cd25hifoxp3+ tregs express lower levels of surface cd62l compared to lrrc32- cd4+cd25hifoxp3+ tregs, suggesting that lrrc <dig> expression may alter surface expression of other activation markers of t cells such as cd62l. finally, functional data demonstrate that lrrc32+ tregs appear more suppressive compared to lrrc32- tregs, suggesting that lrrc <dig> surface expression may be useful as a marker that selects for more potent treg populations, although our data suggest that the functional difference in suppression between these two populations is not markedly robust. hence, lrrc <dig> selection may be most useful when used in combination with other treg markers  <cit> .
