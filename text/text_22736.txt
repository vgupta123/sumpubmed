BACKGROUND
the notochord is the synapomorphy that gives chordates their name. in vertebrates, this embryonic structure is transient, as it is replaced by the vertebral column, and acts as a powerful organizer, secreting signals required for the patterning of several organs, such as the floor plate, somites, pancreas, heart and dorsal aorta  <cit> . developing chordate embryos, including all vertebrates as well as the invertebrate chordates , require a notochord for structural stability, tail elongation, and as an anchor point for muscle contraction  <cit> . due to the limited experimental accessibility of the vertebrate notochord and the time and expenses required to generate transgenic vertebrate embryos, a considerable amount of the recent research on notochord genes and their transcriptional regulation has been carried out in invertebrate chordates, particularly ascidians, such as ciona intestinalis  <cit>  and halocynthia roretzi  <cit> , which together with thaliaceans and larvaceans  <cit>  are part of the tunicate subphylum. studies in ciona intestinalis have identified numerous notochord genes, both evolutionarily conserved  <cit>  and lineage-specific  <cit> . parallel studies of a subset of orthologs of ciona notochord genes have shown their expression in the mouse notochord  <cit> .

while these observations indicate that ascidians represent a valid model for studying the evolutionary origins of the notochord, they also raise questions on the applicability of these findings to other invertebrate chordates. in fact, a considerable degree of variability in the structure and genetic makeup of the notochord has been found among invertebrate chordates; the most striking example of such variability is arguably the notochord of amphioxus , which is functionally related to the ascidian notochord but expresses numerous muscle genes  <cit> , in addition to typical notochord markers  <cit> . even within ascidians, divergent species such as ciona  and halocynthia , employ different molecular strategies to build morphologically similar structures, as shown by studies on the molecular control of secondary notochord induction  <cit> .

in this study, we have begun probing the extent of variation tolerable in the notochord gene complement used by representatives of two classes of tunicates. to this aim, we tested in the larvacean oikopleura dioica the expression patterns of notochord genes previously characterized in the ascidian ciona intestinalis.

oikopleura dioica  is a small pelagic tunicate which possesses the most compact genome identified in any chordate, at only  <dig> mb  <cit> . oikopleura has a 6-day life cycle at 15°c  <cit>  and can be cultured in vitro in a suitably staffed laboratory. oikopleura and other larvaceans are unique among tunicates in that they retain the notochord throughout their lifespan  <cit> . differently from the notochord of a ciona tailbud, which consists of  <dig> cells and is flanked on each side by  <dig> muscle cells  <cit> , the notochord of a tailbud oikopleura embryo contains only  <dig> cells , flanked on each side by  <dig> muscle cells  <cit> . while in ciona the  <dig> notochord cells cease to divide by the early tailbud stage  <cit>  and are gradually reabsorbed at metamorphosis  <cit> , the notochord cells in oikopleura increase their number through additional mitoses, which bring their final count to 120- <dig> by the third day of life  <cit> . nevertheless, the overall "stack-of-coins" arrangement of the notochord cells and the morphogenetic events that characterize notochord differentiation, including the formation of vacuoles which eventually coalesce to form a hollow lumen, appear quite similar between these tunicates  <cit>  . the main difference identified so far at the molecular level is in the expression of hox genes, which are absent from the ciona notochord  <cit>  but are expressed in the oikopleura notochord in a spatial sequence resembling the colinear expression seen in vertebrates  <cit> . most importantly, the oikopleura notochord also expresses brachyury  <cit> , a t-box transcription factor necessary for notochord formation in ciona and in all chordates analyzed thus far  <cit> . most of the currently known brachyury-downstream notochord genes have been identified in ciona intestinalis  <cit> .

the conserved notochord expression of brachyury homologs in ciona and oikopleura prompted us to use the  <dig> notochord genes identified so far as bona fide ciona brachyury  targets to assess whether, and to what extent, oikopleura retains the notochord gene battery identified in ciona. the work presented here therefore begins by surveying the oikopleura genome and by identifying in silico orthologs of ci-bra target genes. the expression of these genes was then analyzed by wmish on oikopleura embryos fixed at embryonic stages that correspond, approximately, to the stages at which notochord expression is detected in ciona  <cit>  as well as on embryos at later developmental stages. our results show that of the  <dig> ci-bra target genes that were used as a starting point,  <dig> did not have detectable counterparts in the oikopleura genome. we were able to clone and analyze  <dig> of the remaining  <dig> genes , and found that  <dig> of these genes were expressed in the notochord, seven were expressed at low levels throughout the tail, thus possibly including the notochord, six were clearly expressed in tissues other than the notochord, and two were not detectable under the experimental conditions employed. taken together, our results suggest a considerable divergence in the notochord genetic toolkit between ciona and oikopleura and begin to pinpoint genes and pathways that might be conserved in this structure as a result of evolutionary constraints.

RESULTS
lineage-specific duplication events among oikopleura orthologs of ciona notochord genes
to identify notochord genes in oikopleura, we used as a starting point a list of  <dig> notochord genes which had been previously characterized in ciona intestinalis as ci-bra transcriptional targets  <cit>  . one gene, ci-collagen α <dig> type xviii  <dig>  included in a previously published list of ci-bra targets  <cit> , was excluded from this study due to discrepancies in gene model references. we used the reciprocal best blast hit method  <cit>  to detect and characterize bona fide orthologs of ci-bra targets present in the oikopleura genome. briefly, we used both the allelic and reference first draft genome assembly of oikopleura, as well as  <dig>  computer-generated gene models  as databases for our blastx or tblastn queries  <cit> , using ciona jgi version  <dig>  translated gene models  for first-pass screens and subsequently comparing the results with the updated ciona kh  gene models  <cit>  as reported in the aniseed database . out of  <dig> queries, only  <dig> yielded identifiable positive reciprocal best blast hits .

for each reciprocal best blast hit, the corresponding oikopleura genomic region, gene model and available ests sequences were collected and aligned to allow manual curation prior to cloning . this procedure uncovered possible duplication events. in particular, we noticed that two different genes seemed to have been duplicated in oikopleura, od-noto <dig> and od-calumenin, while a third one, od-noto <dig>  was found to be present in three copies. for this reason, in the case of these genes  and a few more , we resorted to the generation of phylogenetic reconstructions in order to minimize mis-assignments of orthologous relationships.

to construct a phylogenetic tree of orthologs of ci-noto <dig> , we performed a blast search against genbank . interestingly, this search retrieved predominantly tunicate sequences, from the ascidians ciona savignyi, halocynthia roretzi, molgula tectiformis and diplosoma listerianum, as opposed to other deuterostome sequences. extensive blast searches of specific databases of genomic and est sequences, including strongylocentrotus purpuratus, saccoglossus kowalevskii, branchiostoma floridae, petromyzon marinus and mus musculus, yielded hits with poor e-values , even though a conserved ras-like domain  <cit>  was detected in the ci-noto <dig> protein sequence. among those hits, five uncharacterized predicted protein sequences from branchiostoma floridae  with e-values between 2e- <dig> and 6e- <dig> were retrieved . to root the tree, we used two different representative sequences of the ras-superfamily  as outgroups. surprisingly, tunicate noto <dig> putative orthologs bundled together, while no clear relationships were found with any of the five predicted amphioxus proteins, which group themselves separately in our tree , though without sufficient statistical support. this suggests that we retrieved bona fide tunicate noto <dig> orthologs which belong to either a novel family specific to the tunicate lineage, or to a group of divergent members eluding identification, or that the noto <dig> and unidentified amphioxus genes represent a group of chordate-specific genes that arose early during the evolutionary history of the lineage, and has been preserved in cephalochordates and tunicates but secondarily lost in the vertebrate lineage. moreover, the two putative noto <dig> orthologs found in oikopleura are grouped together with a statistical support of 99% by both neighbor-joining and bayesian inference methods; this suggests that these copies arose from a duplication event specific to oikopleura. in an effort to trace back this event, we studied the genomic localization and neighboring genes of od-noto15a and od-noto15b, but we did not find conclusive syntenic relationships between these genes, either intra- or interspecifically .

three copies of the ciona noto9/fusebp gene are present in the oikopleura genome
we used the reciprocal best blast hit method to identify orthologs of ci-noto <dig> in other deuterostome sequence databases. all best hits corresponded to far upstream element binding proteins   <cit>  and were found in diverse animals spanning the main branches of the deuterostome lineage . fusebps belong to the large superfamily of rna-binding proteins, and more specifically to the k-homology  rna-binding domain  <cit> . we therefore rooted the tree with various deuterostome heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein k  protein sequences as outgroups. in most deuterostomes, a single copy of fusebp  was found, while  <dig> fusebps were found in mammalian genomes as well as in oikopleura. however, our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the three copies found in mammals and oikopleura arose from independent lineage-specific duplication events. in fact, vertebrate fusebps group together with a statistical support of 98% with the neighbor-joining method and 100% of posterior probabilities as calculated by the bayesian inference method, whereas od-noto9a, od-noto9b and od-noto9c group together with a statistical support of 92% and 100%, respectively, in a related yet separate tunicate monophyletic group. despite our efforts, no other copies were found in other tunicate databases, which tentatively indicates that these duplications were isolated events circumscribed to the peculiar genomic evolutionary history of oikopleura; however, this conclusion might have to be revisited once complete genomic sequences become available for other tunicates.

gene duplications, synteny and genomic rearrangements: the case of the calumenin genes
another phylogenetic tree was constructed to study the evolutionary history and reciprocal relationships of calumenin genes from basal deuterostomes . calumenin proteins belong to a family of low-affinity ca2+-binding, multiple ef-hand proteins which includes cab <dig>  reticulocalbin, erc- <dig>  and calumenin   <cit> . as numerous copies of these genes are present in mammalian genomes, and as these were not annotated following a rigorous phylogenetic reconstruction, we restricted our analysis to basal deuterostomes by excluding gnathostome sequences from this study. to root the tree we employed ascidian reticulocalbin sequences. we found multiple copies of calumenin genes in invertebrate deuterostome genomes: two copies in the sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus, two in oikopleura and three copies in the sister species ciona intestinalis and ciona savignyi. despite our extensive efforts, only single-copy genes were found in amphioxus, enteropneust and lamprey genomes. we also observed that in our phylogenetic reconstructions putative calumenin orthologs in oikopleura were not satisfactorily linked to any monophyletic group in this tree. although od-calumenin <dig> is found inside a statistically supported group with all other calumenin sequences, od-calumenin <dig> is not reliably linked to this group, likely because of the high evolutionary rate of divergence of oikopleura genes. in addition, the two copies found in the sea urchin genome seem to have arisen from a duplication event independent from that which gave rise to the three copies found in ascidians. in order to trace these duplication events, we analyzed the genomic location and flanking genes of calumenin paralogs found in ciona, strongylocentrotus and oikopleura . this allowed us to gain more insights into the evolutionary history of these genes in different genomes, as we found that all calumenin paralogs map to a single chromosome  in ascidians as well as in the sea urchin. in particular, the calumenin paralogs that we found in ciona savignyi are clustered in a contiguous arrangement on reftig <dig>  which suggests that they originated from two tandem duplication events. in ciona intestinalis, the three calumenin genes are found on the same chromosome, but calumenin1a and calumenin1b are separated by more than  <dig>  mb from calumenin <dig> . nevertheless, we found that calumenin paralogs are flanked in both ciona species by two genes: a gene similar to the unannotated gene model kyotograil <dig> . <dig>  , and a gene annotated as gpr <dig>  . these observations indicate that the linked arrangement found in ciona savignyi might have been split by a chromosomal rearrangement in ciona intestinalis. the fact that the genes flanking calumenin paralogs are identical between the two ciona species but different from those found in the sea urchin, strengthens the hypothesis that the echinoderm calumenin paralogs arose from distinct duplication events. in oikopleura, calumenin paralogs map to different scaffolds and are flanked by genes that are not found in the vicinity of the ascidian calumenin paralogs, which limits the conclusions that can be drawn on their origin.

identification of novel oikopleura notochord genes
specific cdna fragments corresponding to  <dig> oikopleura genes identified as bona fide orthologs of ciona notochord genes were cloned by pcr , and used to synthesize antisense rna probes that were tested on oikopleura embryos by wmish. time-points of  <dig>  ,  <dig> , and  <dig>   hpf at 21°c were used, as these corresponded, approximately, to the developmental stages at which the ciona counterparts are known to be expressed  <cit> . of the  <dig> probes tested, two  yielded no signal at any of the stages analyzed, despite repeated attempts. thirteen of the genes tested were expressed in all or part of the notochord in at least one developmental stage: od-prickle, od-quaking, od-thrombospondin  <dig>  od-fibrillar collagen  <dig> , od- β <dig> -galactosyltransferase , od-calumenin <dig>  od-calumenin <dig>  od-ezrin/radixin/moesin , od-iq motif-containing gtpase-activating protein , od-leprecan, od-zipper , od-netrin and od-laminin α <dig> . seven probes, od-cdc <dig>  od-noto9a, od-noto9b, od-noto9c, od-noto <dig>  od-noto15a and od-noto <dig>  yielded a diffuse, weak signal in the tail, which might indicate low expression levels in the notochord . finally, six of the probes tested revealed distinct staining patterns which did not include notochord: od-aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator , od-proliferating cell nuclear antigen , od-tensin, od-atp citrate lyase , atp sulfurylase/adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate  kinase  and od-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase  .

we found that conserved oikopleura notochord genes exhibited variable expression patterns , and some of these genes were expressed in other tissues in addition to the notochord. od-prickle  and od-calumenin <dig>  were also expressed in some areas of the trunk, while od-quaking , od-fcol <dig> , and possibly od-β4-galt  were expressed in muscle cells as well as in notochord cells. interestingly, similarly to od-quaking and od-fcol <dig>  ci-quaking and cifcol <dig> are also expressed in notochord and muscle cells, with the latter gene being expressed also in nervous system and endoderm in addition to these territories  <cit> . od-thrombospondin  <dig> , od-calumenin <dig> , od-erm , od-iqgap , od-leprecan  and od-zipper  were notochord-specific at these stages. additional variability was seen in the developmental windows of expression of these genes. while most genes were expressed in the notochord at all time-points between mid-tailbud/early hatchling and stage  <dig>  four of them, od-β4-galt , od-calumenin <dig> , od-erm  and od-iqgap , were expressed only transiently and their expression had more or less faded by stage  <dig>  for eight of these oikopleura notochord genes we identified expression in notochord precursors at the neurula stage ; remarkably, however, none of the oikopleura genes were expressed in the notochord after stage  <dig> . these observations confirm the correlation previously described between the morphogenetic events of notochord formation for ciona intestinalis and oikopleura dioica  <cit> , according to which by eight hours after fertilization oikopleura dioica embryos reach the ascidian stage iv, which is characterized by completion of vacuolization and formation of a hollow tubular notochord.

while little is known about the possible role of the putative non-muscle myosin heavy chain encoded by zipper in notochord formation, the conserved ci-bra target orthologs expressed in the oikopleura notochord encode proteins that in other organisms have been reported to serve a wide range of functions. od-fcol <dig>  od-thrombospondin  <dig> and od-leprecan encode components of the extracellular matrix which are required for notochord integrity  <cit> . prickle, which encodes a planar cell polarity protein, has been shown to be necessary for notochord cell intercalation in both ciona intestinalis and ciona savignyi  <cit> . ezrin-radixin-moesin, which belongs to a class of proteins which help to organize the cell cortex through their cytoskeletal and transmembrane interaction domains  <cit> , has been shown to be required for notochord cell elongation in ciona intestinalis  <cit> . the conserved notochord genes, quaking, β4-galt, calumenin <dig>  calumenin <dig> and iqgap, which encode, respectively, an rna-binding protein, an enzyme involved in lactose biosynthesis, ca2+-binding proteins, and a scaffolding protein of the rho family, respectively, have also been found to be expressed in the notochord of other chordates  <cit> . in particular, the quaking rna-binding protein has been shown to be necessary for notochord formation in xenopus, where it stabilizes the mrnas for proteins that are required for notochord development, including that of xenopus brachyury  <cit> , while xiqgap <dig> has been reported to be predominantly localized to lamellipodia and filopodia in the xenopus notochord, at the time when the morphogenetic movements leading to notochord formation take place  <cit> .

oikopleura netrin, laminin α <dig>  and the molecular heterogeneity of the notochord of basal chordates
among the oikopleura genes for which we found conserved notochord expression, one, od-netrin, displayed a strikingly uneven pattern, being detectable only in a subset of notochord cells. proteins of the netrin family are diffusible chemoattractants required for axon guidance in a wide variety of animals  <cit> . od-netrin was first detected in a few notochord precursors at the neurula stage ; at the mid-tailbud/early hatchling stage and stage  <dig>  notochord expression was distinctively discontinuous  and the signal began fading from the notochord cells shortly after, by stage  <dig>  when it was detected only in anterior notochord cell , although it remained clearly visible in the trunk. while in mid-tailbud embryos there were two groups of stained notochord cells separated by a gap, in all embryos at stage  <dig> we could distinguish three groups of contiguous stained cells separated by two gaps of blank cells . the anterior-most segment of stained notochord contained on average 2- <dig> cells, while the middle segment contained five cells, displaying variable levels of staining  and the posterior-most segment contained two cells. the gaps usually spanned three cells . the pattern that we observed for od-netrin is substantially different from that reported for ci-netrin, as the latter is expressed quite homogeneously in all notochord cells at all stages analyzed  <cit> .

a discontinuous pattern similar to the pattern that we observed for od-netrin had been previously reported for one of the oikopleura hox genes, od-hox <dig>  which shows a distinct gap between two stained regions of the notochord  <cit>  ; another oikopleura hox gene, od-hox <dig>  is expressed only in a stretch of six contiguous notochord cells . however, the od-netrin pattern cannot be perfectly superimposed to the pattern seen for either of the two od-hox genes, suggesting that other transcription factors and/or additional regulatory mechanisms might be modulating this peculiar expression. within tunicates, a similarly irregular pattern in notochord cells has been reported for ciona multidom, a ci-bra-downstream notochord gene that does not have counterparts in oikopleura . however, ci-multidom is expressed in a completely mosaic fashion, whereby expression surfaces randomly in a variable number of notochord cells whose position along the anterior-posterior axis of the notochord is randomized as well  <cit> . remarkably, an amphioxus netrin gene, amphinetrin, has been described to be expressed with variable intensity along the notochord in a stage-dependent fashion  <cit> . in particular, at neurulation, amphinetrin is strongly expressed in the anterior extension of the notochord underlying the cerebral vesicle, while in early larvae expression in this region is no longer detectable  <cit> .

the functional meaning and developmental consequences of a discontinuous source of netrin in the notochord remain to be elucidated. however, it is intriguing that the oikopleura caudal nerve cord contains ganglia scattered along its length at irregular intervals  <cit> , from which thin peripheral nerve fibers project ventrally on the surface of the notochord cells  <cit> . in hatched larvae around  <dig> hpf , which is approximately the stage shown in figure. 5c and 5e-i, the first nerve fibers become visible in the caudal ganglion and in the nerve cord, dorsal to the notochord  <cit> , and by  <dig> hours and  <dig> minutes after fertilization the full complement of post-mitotic neurons has already been reached  <cit> . it is therefore conceivable that the unevenly distributed sources of netrin that we have identified in the notochord might serve a specific role in the guidance of the peripheral nerve fibers which emanate from the ganglia of the nerve cord.

another peculiar expression pattern has been revealed by this study for od-laminin α <dig>  in embryos at the mid-tailbud stage, this gene is visibly expressed in the trunk and in what appears to be the posterior-most of the  <dig> notochord cells present at this stage . this notochord cell is also known as the "terminal" cell or "t-cell"  <cit>  and displays a characteristic round shape . transient staining was also observed in other cells of the tail flanking the notochord ; however, no signal was detected in notochord cells other than the terminal cell at either earlier  or later stages . in embryos at 7- <dig> hpf and 10- <dig> hpf, expression of od-laminin α <dig> is detected in a small region of the developing intestine and also in the subchordal cells  <cit> , whose function is yet to be elucidated .

oikopleura genes expressed at low levels throughout the tail
seven of the oikopleura probes employed in this study yielded a more or less diffuse staining throughout the tail at one or more of the developmental stages that were tested . the diffuse staining that we observed in the tail in these cases appeared to encompass the notochord  and was frequently accompanied by staining in the trunk. in the majority of cases, the diffuse staining in the tail was observed exclusively at the mid-tailbud/early hatchling stage . however, in the case of od-noto9a, only embryos at stage  <dig> displayed a weak signal in some regions of the notochord . interestingly, this diffuse staining was observed for all three noto <dig> genes , although while the spatio-temporal expression pattern of od-noto9b and od-noto9c appear practically identical, expression of od-noto9a becomes detectable only at stage  <dig>  in embryos at 7- <dig> hpf, expression of all three genes became confined to the pharynx, in a region likely including the developing ciliary funnel . in embryos at 10- <dig> hpf, expression in the presumptive ciliary funnel was still detectable for od-noto9b and od-noto9c  but not for od-noto9a .

oikopleura genes that are not expressed in notochord cells
six of the oikopleura orthologs of ciona notochord genes analyzed in this study turned out to be expressed in tissues other than the notochord . three of these genes, od-arnt , od-pcna  and od-tensin  were predominantly expressed in the trunk. od-tensin was also transiently expressed in what might be one of the neurons of the caudal ganglion . for three additional genes, od-acl, od-asak and od-camk, we could not detect any signal in neurulae, mid-tailbud/early hatchlings and stages  <dig> and  <dig> ; however, we were able to detect convincing staining in embryos at later stages, namely 7- <dig> hpf and 10- <dig> hpf . in particular, od-acl was detected in a subpopulation of tail neurons, some of which grouped in the caudal ganglion, at both these stages . od-asak expression at 7- <dig> hpf was localized to the spiracles and to some of the posterior trunk cells that eventually constitute the base of the langerhans receptors , and to the presumptive ciliary funnel and various epithelial regions at 10- <dig> hpf . the od-camk probe labeled the ciliary funnel at both 7- <dig> hpf and 10- <dig> hpf ; in addition, at 10- <dig> hpf, a strong signal was detected in the cerebral ganglion, in an area that seems to encompass the statocyst .

considering the morphological similarities between the notochords of ciona and oikopleura, it seems surprising that the oikopleura genome is apparently lacking roughly half of the notochord genes that we searched for, and that only a fraction of the ciona notochord genes that possess identifiable counterparts  in oikopleura are expressed in the notochord. the ciona notochord genes that we used as a reference for this study are active in many cellular processes; genes of still unknown function comprise the largest percentage, while genes encoding transcription factors and other nucleic acid-binding proteins make up the smallest portion . only 21% of the genes of still unknown function  were found in the oikopleura genome, and only some of them are expressed in the notochord . genes involved in cellular metabolism and replication represented the largest category of ciona notochord genes for which we found orthologs in the oikopleura genome, although only  <dig> % of them were expressed in the oikopleura notochord .

it has been demonstrated by previous studies that extracellular matrix proteins are crucial for notochordal integrity  <cit>  and we have previously shown that extracellular matrix genes are highly conserved between the notochords of vertebrates and ciona  <cit> . only seven of the ciona notochord genes included in this study encode extracellular matrix proteins ; of these, four are present in the oikopleura genome, and are indeed expressed in the oikopleura notochord, either homogeneously, as in the case of od-thrombospondin  <dig>  od-fcol <dig>  and od-leprecan , or in an unusually restricted pattern, as in the case of od-laminin α <dig> . these data might tentatively suggest that either fewer extracellular matrix proteins are required in oikopleura for notochordal integrity, or, perhaps more likely, that in oikopleura different extracellular matrix genes, which are not necessarily found or are still undescribed in the ciona notochord, have been co-opted to this structure. nevertheless, the similarity in the expression pattern of od-fcol <dig> in notochord and muscle cells, which is directly comparable to that of the cifcol <dig> pattern  <cit> , seems a strong indication of the requirement of fibrillar collagen for the structural role of the notochord, and possibly of its flanking muscle  <cit> .

first insights into the cis-regulatory mechanisms controlling notochord gene expression in oikopleura
a comparison between the expression patterns of the oikopleura notochord genes identified by this analysis and the published expression pattern for oikopleura brachyury  reveals considerable differences, at both the spatial and the temporal level. differently from ci-bra, which is notochord-specific at all stages  <cit> , odit is expressed in a notochord-specific fashion only at early embryonic stages, while in larvae incubated at 12°c and fixed  <dig> minutes after hatching  expression begins to expand to endodermal territories in the trunk and to slowly decline in notochord cells  <cit> . finally, in larvae one hour after hatching , odit is still strongly expressed in the trunk, but has completely faded in the notochord  <cit> .

most of the notochord genes identified in this study are expressed in the notochord at mid-tailbud and stage 1; however, in stage  <dig> embryos expression of several of these genes begins to fade in notochord cells, and in older embryos all these genes become no longer detectable. this suggests that the temporal regulation of the transcription of these genes is differentially modulated in oikopleura, possibly through the interplay of more activators that might be themselves transiently expressed in notochord cells. a complementary scenario would imply that late-onset transcriptional repressor begin counteracting the function of the notochord activator by the time stage  <dig> is reached. in either case, it is still possible that odit might be regulating the transcription of at least some of the genes described here in notochord cells. this hypothesis seems supported by the observation that the genomic loci of most of the newly discovered oikopleura notochord genes contain various putative brachyury binding sites matching the core sequences previously identified in ciona  <cit> , although their distribution is quite variable and does not mirror that of the binding sites found in the ci-bra direct target genes . therefore, the notochord genes identified through this analysis are likely to provide a useful platform for future studies of the molecular mechanisms through which notochord gene expression is controlled in oikopleura.

CONCLUSIONS
tunicate embryos provide excellent model systems for studies of notochord development and evolution. here we have compared the molecular toolkits of the simple notochords of two divergent tunicates, ciona intestinalis and oikopleura dioica, and we have begun to make inferences about the commonalities and discrepancies among their genetic makeup. based only upon the low conservation of the  <dig> notochord genes that we analyzed in these two tunicates, it might be concluded that significantly less genes than expected are required for notochord formation in oikopleura. however, since the oikopleura genome is considerably divergent from those of other tunicates, it seems reasonable to assume that other genes might fill the roles played by the non-conserved genes. in fact, despite the apparent absence from the oikopleura genome of a large fraction of the notochord genes found in ciona, which parallels the striking lack of genes required for the metabolism of retinoic acid  <cit> , we have found that two of the genes that are single-copy in ciona, noto <dig> and noto <dig>  are duplicated in oikopleura. gene losses accompanied by duplications of some of the remaining genes seem to match a general genome-wide trend in oikopleura  <cit> , which has been previously observed in the divergent and compact genome of c. elegans . it has been hypothesized that retention of duplicates can be causally linked to genome compaction  <cit> . the retention of duplicate genes might also explain why, despite its smaller size and the lack of several genes that are found in ciona, the oikopleura genome is estimated to contain approximately  <dig>  genes  controlling the expression of the duplicated genes. for example, od-calumenin <dig> and od-calumenin <dig> are both expressed in the oikopleura notochord, although they lie on different scaffolds, suggesting, among other scenarios, the possibility that their notochord crm were duplicated along with their coding regions. however, od-calumenin <dig> is expressed in the notochord at all stages tested, while od-calumenin <dig> expression is curtailed by stage  <dig>  which in turn indicates that the temporal regulation of the notochord expression of these genes has changed. similar differences are observed when the expression patterns of the od-noto <dig> paralogs are compared, whereby the expression patterns of od-noto9b and od-noto9c are practically overlapping and od-noto9a seems to have a later developmental onset.

in higher chordates, the notochord is known to serve a dual function: providing structural support to the developing embryo, and secreting patterning signals required for tissue specification and organogenesis  <cit> . the conserved expression of netrin in ciona  <cit>  and in oikopleura suggests that the tunicate notochord, in addition to its structural role, is able to provide some essential positional cues to the developing nervous system. we included in this study also four genes that we had previously found to be expressed in both the ciona and mouse notochord, namely asak, leprecan, pellino and noto <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, od-leprecan was also expressed in the oikopleura notochord, while od-asak was undetectable in this structure at all the stages analyzed. no signal was obtained for od-pellino, and no ortholog was identified in oikopleura for noto <dig> 

these observations, together with the remarkable absence from the oikopleura genome of sonic hedgehog  and previous observations that in ciona neither one of the two hedgehog-related genes seems to be expressed in notochord cells  <cit> , begin to pinpoint the molecular pathways that are already present in the simple tunicate notochord, as opposed to vertebrate innovations. oikopleura and ciona therefore provide us with a model for investigating the role of mechanisms such as co-option and divergence in notochord evolution and for ascertaining the extent of modifications that its genetic toolkit can sustain without major morphogenetic changes. by comparing the essential complement of genes employed by these divergent tunicates to build their simple notochords, we can begin to envision how notochord structure and function have changed during chordate evolution.
