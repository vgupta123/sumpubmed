BACKGROUND
fibronectin  <dig>  is a large adhesive glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix composed of  <dig> nearly identical subunits with a variety of binding domains for cell surface and extracellular ligands. by means of these multiple interaction sites, fn <dig> is involved in a variety of biological processes. its major function is the support of cell adhesion, but fn <dig> also plays a role in cytoskeleton organisation, cell migration, many important physiological processes such as wound healing, thrombosis and ageing  <cit> , and in diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis and arthritis  <cit> .

structurally, fn <dig> is composed of  <dig> types of repeating structural domains  and a single type iii connecting segment . this organisation is conserved among species  <cit> . the functional complexity of fn <dig> is carried out through its protein diversity, which consists of multiple isoforms including plasma fn <dig>  <cit>  and cellular fn <dig> filaments  <cit> . those fn <dig> isoforms are the products of a single gene, and are generated by alternative splicing at  <dig> sites  of the mrna precursor  <cit> . splicing at the eiiia and eiiib regions happens by exon skipping, while the iiics region can be totally included, partially included or totally excluded due to  <dig> alternative splice acceptor sites and one alternative splice donor site within this exon  <cit> . in human and bovine, about  <dig> different protein encoding mrna transcripts are theoretically produced, but it is still unknown whether all of these combinations do exist in vivo  <cit> . the expression level of the spliced isoforms and their relative proportion changes during embryonic development and in pathological processes both spatially and temporarily  <cit> . each alternatively spliced domain has unique biological functions and a lot of studies have been done to reveal the functions of each domain and the splicing regulation mechanisms  <cit> . the eiiia and eiiib regions are absent in plasma fn <dig> and eiiia/eiiib containing fn <dig> is poorly expressed in normal adult tissue but overexpressed in developing embryos, wound healing and tumours  <cit> .

integrins are heterodimeric cell surface glycoprotein receptors composed of  <dig> non-covalently associated subunits α and β, linking the extracellular matrix  with the intracellular cytoskeleton. integrins mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions and the dimerisation of specific α with specific β subunits determines the specificity for the ligand as well as intracellular signalling events  <cit> . upon binding of a ligand, e.g. fn <dig>  integrins transduce signals into the cell interior , but they can also receive intracellular signals that regulate their ligand-binding affinity   <cit> . at least  <dig> different integrins can serve as fn <dig> receptors. some are specifically binding fn <dig> but others have multiple ligands  <cit> .

fn <dig> and its receptors have different functions in mammalian reproduction and embryogenesis   <cit>  and both the fn <dig> alternative splicing as well as the expression of the integrin receptors are developmentally regulated. so far, most studies have focussed on implantation and placentation, but bovine embryos are special in the way that they have a delayed implantation. in contrast to human, the bovine blastocyst elongates in the uterine lumen for several days, until attachment starts around day 19– <dig> post insemination   <cit> . nevertheless a significant rise in bovine fn <dig> expression was already observed at time of transition from morula to blastocyst, more than  <dig> days before bovine implantation occurs. moreover a significantly higher fn <dig> rna expression was found in bovine in vivo golden standard blastocysts, compared to in vitro produced ones  <cit> . until now, little is known about the importance of the fn <dig> matrix during compaction and early blastocyst formation. takahashi et al.  <cit>  described that trophectodermal cells of bovine hatched blastocyst have already acquired the ability to adhere and outgrow on fn <dig>  but, since at this stage of development no attachment of the bovine blastocyst to the uterine epithelium is occurring, other functions for fn <dig> may be assumed. moreover, a study about fn <dig> fibrillogenesis in xenopus  <cit>  suggested that the dynamic assembly of the fn <dig> matrix is cell-type dependent and a key event in regulating cell adhesion, migration and differentiation. based on these data we set up the hypothesis that the embryonic fn <dig> matrix, formed at the onset of blastocyst formation, may have the adhesive property to link cells together and to provide a substrate for cell layer migration.

in a first step to investigate this hypothesis, and to find a link between the embryo culture conditions and alterations in fn <dig> expression, rt-qpcr was performed for the quantitative analysis of the fn <dig> splice variants in bovine oocytes, pre-implantation embryos, cumulus cells and a selection of adult tissues, followed by rt-qpcr and immunofluorescent staining for the determination of integrins as candidate fn <dig> receptors in bovine preimplantation embryos.

for the quantification of the amount of expression of each splice isoform, different standard curves were generated using specific pcr fragments obtained from plasmid constructs containing the specific splice variants as explained in the section methods. after determination of the mass concentration, equimolar concentrations of the pcr products were used for the generation of ten-fold serial dilution series.

pcr efficiencies ranged from  <dig> to 100% and the accuracy of the standard curves was evaluated by analysing each standard dilution point as an unknown sample  <cit> .

results of the qpcr amplification of each splice variant in the presence of excess of the alternative splice variant gave equal ct values and quantities for each dilution point demonstrating the specificity of the primer pairs for each splice isoform . the repeatability of the assay was good, with a standard deviation of less than  <dig>  ct between technical replicates. the accuracy of the standard curves was evaluated by analysing each standard dilution point as an unknown sample  <cit> . the coefficients of variation were less than 1% for the ct values and ranged between  <dig> and 15% for the calculated quantities.

quantification of alternative transcripts using boundary spanning primers
in a first step, conventional rt-pcr with primers surrounding the alternatively spliced regions  were used to get an indication of the presence or absence of each splice isoform in bovine oocytes, embryos, cumulus cells and adult tissues. the results  demonstrated that the eiiib region was nearly absent in bovine oocytes and embryos whereas the eiiia region and the full-length iiics region were highly present. cumulus cells on the other hand, had a different expression pattern with lower expression of the eiiib region and near absence of the eiiia and iiics regions. in adult tissue samples, the eiiia and eiiib regions were mostly absent and the presence of multiple iiics fragments, suggest the expression of more than one transcript isoform. the two main iiics isoforms were the iiics null and the iiics full-length isoforms while the intermediate iiics forms were hardly expressed in the analysed samples.

in the second experiment, rt-qpcr with specific primers pairs was used for quantitative expression analysis of the splice isoforms in the samples .

the overall fn <dig> expression was very low in bovine oocytes and early embryonic stages and increased from the morula stage onwards, followed by a spectacular rise at the blastocyst stage . the fn <dig> rna expression was variable in the adult tissue samples with very low fn <dig> rna expression in udder, spleen, muscle and heart tissue, moderate expression in kidney, uterus and ovaries and high fn <dig> rna expression in liver, lung, placenta and skin tissues.

the eiiib+ isoform was absent or very low expressed in most tissue samples, except in the uterus and cumulus cells in which the eiiib+ splice variant was predominantly expressed. during embryo development, there was a shift in the eiiib splice isoform expression from the eiiib- variant to the eiiib+ variant around the hatched blastocyst stage.

the eiiia+ isoform was the main variant in all embryonic stages. in cumulus cells and most tissue samples on the other hand, the eiiia- variant was mainly expressed. in the reproductive tissues – placenta, uterus and ovary – the eiiia+ variant had a higher rna expression level compared to the other tissue samples.

the iiics full length splice isoform was the only iiics variant expressed during bovine preimplantation embryo development. in cumulus cells the iiiics null isoform was virtually the only iiics variant, whereas in most tissue samples both the null and full-length isoforms were expressed.

comparison of the fn <dig> expression between in vivo and in vitro produced blastocysts by rt-qpcr  showed a  <dig>  fold higher fn <dig> rna expression in in vivo compared to in vitro produced blastocysts . the splice variant ratios did not differ between the two groups for the eiiib and the iiics region , and only a slight increase in eiiia- splice variant expression was observed in in vivo blastocysts but this difference was not significant .

when the information of the  <dig> regions was taken together, sequenced and compared to the  <dig> in silico predicted bovine fn <dig> splice variants in the ncbi entrez gene database  <cit>  none of the described bovine splice variants agreed with the bovine embryo specific variant . the embryo specific transcript variant, , expressed in both in vivo and in vitro preimplantation embryos, was similar to the in silico predicted transcript variant  <dig>  but had a  <dig> bp longer iiics domain .

the combination of the mainly expressed subunits in cumulus cells  also yielded a new fn <dig> splice isoform, temporarily nominated as fn1-csv . in tissue samples, the expression pattern was more diverse and in most of the cases a mixture of more than one transcript variant was expressed but the main transcript variant in bovine tissues agreed with the in silico predicted fn <dig> transcript variant  <dig> .

expression analysis of integrins as candidate fn <dig> receptors during bovine preimplantation embryo development
rna expression analysis
based on a literature search  <cit>  primers were designed for  <dig> integrin α and  <dig> integrin β subunits described to act as receptors for fn <dig> .

rt-qpcr analysis  for those  <dig> integrins revealed that the rna expression pattern of  <dig> subunits – itga2b, itga <dig>  itga <dig>  itga <dig>  itgav and itgb <dig> – followed largely the overall fn <dig> rna expression during bovine preimplantation embryo development, whereas itga <dig>  itga <dig> and itga <dig> were expressed in oocytes, 2-cell and 8-cell embryos but were absent in morulae and blastocysts. itgb <dig> was continuously expressed during preimplantation embryo development. itgb <dig> and itgb <dig> on the other hand, were absent in bovine embryos and itgad and itgb <dig> were only expressed at the hatched blastocyst stage.

the integrins that follow the fn <dig> rna expression pattern  are considered as candidate receptors for the fn1-esv isoform .

for the  <dig> integrin subunits that followed the fn <dig> rna expression pattern  rt-qpcr analyses were run on both in vitro and in vivo embryo samples . the results  showed significant differences in rna expression between in vivo and in vitro produced embryos for  <dig> of the tested integrins. itga2b  and itga <dig>  were significantly higher expressed in in vitro produced blastocyst, whereas the opposite was the case for itga <dig>  and itgb <dig> . the expression of itgb <dig> was not only increased at the blastocyst stage, but itgb <dig> also showed a significantly higher expression in 8-cell in vivo embryos. the differences in rna expression for itga <dig> and itgav were not significant .

protein expression analysis
double immunofluorescent stainings were performed for fn <dig> in combination with one of the  <dig> integrins for which suitable antibodies were commercially available,  on bovine in vitro produced embryos of different developmental stages .

bovine morulae and blastocysts were strongly positive for fn <dig>  itga <dig>  itga <dig> and itgav. fn <dig> was mainly expressed in the inner cell mass  of the blastocysts but a filamentous network of fn <dig> fibrils was also observed from the icm towards the trophectodermal cells  . the integrin subunit itga <dig> was predominantly detected at the cell membranes of the te whereas itga <dig> and itgav were both found mainly in the icm and less in the te . yellow spots on the merged images  showed a partial co-localization of fn <dig> with itga <dig> and itgav in the icm and a partial co-localization between fn <dig> and itga <dig> in the te.

in order to study the fn1-integrin interaction in more detail, higher magnification images  were analysed and confirmed few yellow merged dots for fn1/itga <dig> and fn1/itgav double immunofluorescent stainings, indicating a slight co-localization between fn <dig> and those integrin subunits. however, neither for itga <dig>  nor for itgav full colocalization with fn <dig> was observed.

in the te cells, fn <dig> appeared as a filamentous network of fibers in close apposition to the itga <dig> positive cell membranes but true co-localization between itga <dig> and fn <dig> could not be observed.

discussion
in this study, the analysis of fn <dig> splice variants and integrins as candidate fn <dig> receptors was performed in order to test our hypothesis that bovine embryonic fn <dig> expressed at the morula and early blastocyst stage, may be involved in the adhesion and migration of embryonic cell layers at the onset of differentiation.

the first objective of this study was to determine the fn <dig> splice isoforms expressed during bovine preimplantation embryo development and to compare them with the ones expressed in oocytes, cumulus cells and adult tissue samples. the optimized rt-qpcr assay revealed large differences in overall fn <dig> rna expression and, more importantly, large differences in splice variant expression.

the maternal fn <dig> transcript isoform, expressed in oocytes and gradually degrading in 2-cell embryos, was identical to the embryonic fn <dig> transcript isoform expressed from the morula stage onwards. sequencing followed by the comparison of this splice variant  with the in silico predicted bovine fn <dig> transcript variants in the ncbi entrez gene database  <cit>  revealed that it constitutes a new fn <dig> splice isoform  supporting our hypothesis that fn <dig> exerts a specific function during compaction and early blastocyst formation.

previous studies  <cit>  reported that in vitro produced embryos had a reduced fn <dig> rna expression compared to in vivo "golden standard" embryos. in vitro culture conditions are largely different from the in vivo environment in the maternal tract and deficiency in survival factors such as cytokines and growth factors are known to have consequences for the quality of the in vitro embryo by induction of changes in gene expression, metabolism and even epigenetic modifications. as growth factors, cytokines, hormones and even stress are also reported to act as regulators of alternative splicing  <cit>  a comparison of the fn <dig> splice variant expression between in vivo and in vitro blastocysts was performed. the significantly higher fn <dig> rna expression found in in vivo blastocysts was not associated with a switch in splice variant composition. the fn1-esv splice variant was also found in in vivo blastocysts and the ratios between the splice variants remained largely constant.

from the hatched blastocyst stage onwards, the expression of the eiiib region increased, pointing to a shift in fn <dig> splice variant expression from the fn1-esv isoform towards the in silico predicted fn <dig> isoform  <dig> . this shift goes together with the onset of initial differentiation of the primitive endoderm or hypoblast in cattle  <cit>  and is not surprising since the primitive endoderm was demonstrated to be the major source of fn <dig> production  <cit> . the fn <dig> isoform  <dig>  is involved in cell lineage and tissue rearrangements  <cit> , processes that occur extensively during early embryogenesis. the expression of a second fn <dig> transcript variant in hatched blastocysts supports our hypothesis that fn <dig> exerts multiple functions during blastocyst formation.

another remarkable finding was the difference in fn <dig> isoform expression between the oocyte  and the surrounding cumulus cells. the cumulus cells express another new fn <dig> isoform, named fn1-csv . the adhesion of spermatozoa to the oolemma is mediated by integrins recognizing the rgd sequence in glycoproteins such as fn <dig> and vitronectin  <cit> . but since a different fn <dig> isoform is expressed in oocytes and cumulus cells, a different function for fn <dig> can be expected.

in adult tissues, a variety of different splice variants was found. in general, the eiiib and eiiia region were excluded, agreeing with other studies describing exclusion of these regions in normal adult tissues  <cit>  but inclusion during pathological conditions  <cit> . soluble plasma fn <dig>   <cit>  is particularly secreted by hepatocytes, probably explaining the higher expression of the iiics- variant in liver tissue. it was not the main focus of our research to study the fn <dig> isoform expression in adult tissue samples, but the aberrant splice variant pattern  in the reproductive tissues  was remarkable, although not entirely unexpected. these tissues are very proliferative and active, and the inclusion of eiiia and eiiib occur under such conditions  <cit> . embryo implantation and placenta formation require, besides cell migration, trophoblast differentiation and villous mesenchyme formation, also intensive vascular proliferation and angiogenesis  <cit> , explaining the higher inclusion of the eiiia and eiiib regions.

taking a closer look at the fn1-esv isoform, it was seen that the main difference with the most closely related isoform  was the inclusion of a  <dig> bp fragment containing a second rgd motif, a tyr fosforylation site and an asn glycosylation site. the rgd motif is the recognition site for interaction with integrins and the conserved rgd motif is located in the 10th type iii domain, next to the phsrn synergy site located in the 9th type iii domain. upon interaction with the rgd ligand, the integrins can transduce signals into the cell interior, but they may also receive intracellular signals regulating their cell binding affinity  <cit> . the various α integrin subunits have different cytoplasmic tails by which they are able to activate different cellular responses upon binding to a common extracellular ligand  <cit> . by the binding of cytoskeleton linkage proteins such as talin, vinculin and α-actinin to their cytoplasmic tail, integrins serve as transmembrane links between extracellular contacts and the cytoskeleton  <cit>  and act as modulators of cytoskeleton organisation, an important process during blastocyst formation. as the fn1-esv isoform contains a second rgd motif, the study of the integrin expression in bovine embryos may help to find out more about the functions of fn <dig> during blastocyst formation. itga5b <dig> and itgavb <dig> are classical receptors for fn <dig> but at least  <dig> other different integrins may serve as receptors for fibronectin and many integrins can bind multiple ligands. rt-qpcr analysis was performed for  <dig> selected α and  <dig> selected β subunits. the integrin subunits following the fn <dig> expression profile  and the itgb <dig> subunit expressed in all the tested developmental stages, were considered as potential receptors for the new embryonic fn <dig> splice isoform. itgad and itgb <dig> were only expressed at the hatched blastocyst stage, making them good candidate receptors for fn <dig> isoform  <dig>  furthermore, remarkable differences in integrin rna expression were found between in vivo and in vitro produced blastocysts. the embryonic origin might not only influence the fn <dig> expression but also the integrin expression, or ligand and receptor might regulate each others expression.

the double immunofluorescent stainings on in vitro produced bovine blastocysts found itga <dig> mainly located in the te cells, whereas itga <dig> and itgav were stronger expressed in the icm. although the integrins were expressed in close proximity to fn <dig>  there was no full co-localisation between fn <dig> and one of  <dig> the receptors. either, none of the tested integrins was the unique fn <dig> receptor, each integrin receptor can bind to other ligands besides fn <dig>  or the fn1-esv isoform can interact with more than one integrin receptor by the dual rgd sequences. one should keep in mind that analogous to the differences observed for rna expression, differences in protein expression can exist between in vitro and in vivo golden standard embryos. itga2b and itga <dig> were not tested in this study due to the lack of suitable, specific antibodies. our approach using rna expression pattern analysis and double immunofluorescent stainings excluded some integrins as candidate binding partners for the embryo specific fn <dig> isoform, but we were not able to identify one specific fn <dig> receptor in bovine blastocysts. the application of other molecular techniques such as the yeast two hybrid method  <cit>  or the mappit strategy  <cit>  will be necessary for further analysis of the fn1-integrin interaction in bovine blastocysts in order to find out more about the function of fn <dig> during early blastocyst formation.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have established a reliable assay for mrna quantification of different fn <dig> splice isoforms. the assay was used for fn <dig> expression analysis in bovine oocytes, embryos, cumulus cells and adult tissues and as such we have identified  <dig> novel fn <dig> isoforms, specifically expressed in early embryos and cumulus cells, respectively. the existence of the fn1-esv transcript variant strengthens our hypothesis that fn <dig> may exert a specific function during blastocyst formation.

expression analysis of integrins, the main family of fn <dig> receptors, during bovine preimplantation embryo development was a first step towards unravelling the fn <dig> function during blastocyst formation. rt-pcr identified candidate binding partners for the fn1-esv isoform, but detailed identification of its receptor needs further investigation to test our hypothesis that the embryonic fn <dig> matrix has the adhesive property to link cells together and provides a substrate for cell layer migration.
