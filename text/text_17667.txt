BACKGROUND
yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague, an infectious disease that results in lymphatic and blood infections  <cit> . the y. pestis genome has been sequenced  <cit> . y. pestis carries three plasmids of approximately  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> kilobasepairs and each carries genes necessary for or that contribute to the pathogenicity of the bacterium  <cit> . the  <dig> kilobasepair plasmid encodes the low-calcium response stimulon . components of the lcrs include yops  and a type iii secretion apparatus, or ysc. the type iii secretion apparatus is responsible for the translocation of the yops to host cells that in turn down-regulate the response of the host phagocytic cells to infection  <cit> . natural lcrs-negative mutants of y. pestis occur, resulting in avirulence of the bacteria  <cit> . besides the three plasmids, another pathogenicity factor is pigmentation. cells of y. pestis adsorb hemin at 26°c but not at 37°c and are pigmented  and virulent. spontaneous nonpigmented  mutants of y. pestis have been isolated. the yersiniabactin iron transport system is part of the pgm locus, and its loss results in a pgm- mutant that is avirulent in mice unless hemin, ferrous sulfate, or ferric chloride is injected into mice along with the bacterial challenge  <cit> .

recently, a new class of molecules has been shown to regulate gene expression in bacteria, small non-coding regulatory rnas . these srnas have gained much attention as recent genome-wide studies have identified srnas in a wide variety of organisms  <cit> . most of these bacterial srnas are between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides  in length and play important roles in global regulation  <cit> . hfq is a small rna binding protein and srnas in particular are targets for hfq  <cit> . binding of these srnas by hfq in some way facilitates base pairing between the srnas and their respective target rnas  <cit> . in vibrio cholerae, srnas  have been shown to regulate virulence genes  <cit>  and in brucella abortus an hfq mutation is lethal  <cit> . these results suggest that srnas and hfq likely play important roles in the virulence of certain gram-negative pathogens.

the e. coli gcvb gene encodes srnas that are not translated in vivo  <cit> . a strain carrying a deletion of gcvb has constitutive synthesis of oppa and dppa, periplasmic binding proteins of the two major peptide transport systems normally repressed in cells grown in rich medium  <cit> . in addition to oppa and dppa, several other proteins were shown to increase or decrease in response to gcvb rna levels, but the specific proteins were not identified  <cit> . nevertheless, the results show that the gcvb rnas are regulatory and possibly serve as global regulators. a computer search of the y. pestis sequence showed that y. pestis has a gcvb gene that shares considerable sequence homology with the e. coli gcvb sequence . thus, the gcvb rnas from e. coli likely have functional counterparts in y. pestis. the results of this study show that the y. pestis gcvb gene encodes two srnas that, in turn, have regulatory activity. in addition, a deletion of the gcvb gene from the y. pestis chromosome alters growth rate and colony morphology.

RESULTS
identification of the y. pestis gcvb gene
the e. coli gcvb gene is divergently transcribed from gcva, which encodes the activator protein for gcvb expression   <cit> . thus, we used computer searches of genome sequences with the gcva gene product as a query to predict gcvb homologs in other organisms. we identified gcvb-like rna sequences in the genera yersinia, salmonella, haemophilus, vibrio, pasteurella, shigella, erwinia, klebsiella, photorhabdus and actinobacillus. despite considerable sequence variation in many of these homologs, they are predicted by the mfold algorithm  <cit>  to assume a similar secondary structure. a comparison of three of these gcvb rnas is shown in fig.  <dig>  the location of the putative y. pestis gcvb gene adjacent to and divergent from gcva, its 77% sequence similarity to the e. coli gcvb sequence and its predicted secondary structure make it a likely homolog of gcvb in y. pestis. furthermore, identical gcvb sequences can be found in all other y. pestis strains presently in the data base, both virulent and avirulent strains.

the y. pestis gcvb gene encodes two srnas
the e. coli gcvb gene encodes two srna transcripts that are not translated in vivo  <cit> . to determine if the gcvb gene in y. pestis is functional and possibly encodes srnas, we initially constructed plasmid pgcvbyp+53::lacz, carrying a transcriptional fusion of the gcvb gene at basepair  + <dig> to lacz. plasmid pgcvbyp+53::lacz and the vector alone were transformed into y. pestis strain kim <dig>  the transformants grown in heart-infusion broth  + ampicillin  to mid-log phase of growth and the cultures assayed for β-galactosidase activity. the kim <dig> and kim <dig>  control transformant gave  <dig> ±  <dig>  and  <dig> ±  <dig> units of β-galactosidase activity, respectively, whereas the kim <dig>  transformant gave  <dig>  ±  <dig> units of β-galactosidase activity. the results suggest that the gcvb gene is expressed in y. pestis.

the gcvb gene from y. pestis possesses two possible rho-independent transcription terminators, which if functional, would allow the production of two srnas of about  <dig> nts and  <dig> nts . three transcriptional gene fusions of the y. pestis gcvb gene to lacz were created to determine if these putative terminator sites function as transcription terminators in vivo. the three fusions, designated λgcvbyp+53::lacz, λgcvbyp+164::lacz and λgcvbyp+251::lacz, were used to lysogenize e. coli strain gs <dig>  the lysogens were then grown in luria-bertani broth   <cit>  to mid-log phase of growth and the cultures assayed for β-galactosidase activity. about 44% of the β-galactosidase activity seen when the fusion precedes both terminators  is lost when the fusion point follows terminator t <dig> , implicating t <dig> as a site of transcription termination in vivo . the remaining activity that escapes termination by t <dig> is not seen in gs162λgcvbyp+251::lacz, indicating t <dig> also functions as a terminator in vivo . when the  <dig> nts preceding terminator t <dig> for gcvb were analyzed, there were only short open reading frames  that could encode polypeptides of  <dig> amino acids or less. these orfs all lack good translational start sites and were not tested to determine if they encode small polypeptides. the e. coli gcvb rnas are not translated into polypeptides  <cit> . thus, we conclude that the products of the gcvb gene in y. pestis are two srnas that are not translated, although the results do not completely rule out the possibility that the y. pestis gcvb srnas encode small peptides. in e. coli, about 90% of the transcripts that initiate at the gcvb promoter terminate at terminator t <dig>  and the remaining 10% terminate at terminator t <dig>  <cit> . a comparison of the e. coli and y. pestis t <dig> sites shows that an additional  <dig> bps occur between the predicted gc-rich stem-loop structure and the run of t residues in the y. pestis t <dig> site that are not present in the e. coli sequence, suggesting that the y. pestis t <dig> site is likely less functional as a transcription terminator than the e. coli t <dig> site . nevertheless, the results are consistent with the y. pestis gcvb gene encoding two srna molecules of about  <dig> and  <dig> nts and in roughly equal amounts.

we used northern blotting to confirm that the gcvb locus in y. pestis encodes srna transcripts of about  <dig> and  <dig> nts. two small rna molecules were detected in rna isolated from y. pestis kim <dig> grown in hib medium using a probe specific for the gcvb locus . these results are consistent with the in vivo results with the y. pestis gcvb transcriptional fusions.

regulation of the y. pestis gcvb gene
the e. coli gcvb gene is activated by gcva in the presence of glycine and repressed by gcva + gcvr in its absence; this repression is enhanced by the addition of purines  <cit> . the regulation of the y. pestis gcvb gene was tested with respect to the effects of glycine and purine supplementation to the growth medium and with respect to the gcvr and gcva proteins and the gcvb rnas. for these experiments we used the λgcvbyp+53::lacz fusion to lysogenize appropriate e. coli host strains. the lysogens were grown in glucose minimal  or gm supplemented with glycine or inosine to mid-log phase of growth and assayed for β-galactosidase levels. in the wild-type  gs162λgcvbyp+53::lacz lysogen, the addition of glycine to gm growth medium resulted in an  <dig> -fold induction of β-galactosidase expression, whereas the addition of the purine inosine resulted in a  <dig> -fold repression below the unsupplemented gm level . in the gcva mutant lysogen gs1118λgcvbyp+53::lacz, the β-galactosidase levels were low and non-inducible by glycine . the addition of inosine had no significant effect in the gcva mutant strain. in the gcvr mutant lysogen gs1053λgcvbyp+53::lacz, the β-galactosidase levels are constitutively high under all three growth conditions . the results suggest that activation of the y. pestis gcvb gene requires the gcva protein and that repression requires the gcvr protein. whether the negative regulation by gcvr requires a direct interaction of gcvr with gcva as in e. coli  <cit>  awaits further investigation. furthermore, there appears to be no autoregulation of gcvb by its own srna products as the gcvb mutant lysogen gs1144λgcvbyp+53::lacz shows normal regulation of the gcvbyp+53::lacz fusion .

y. pestis gcva encodes an activator protein for gcvb expression
since activation of the y. pestis gcvbyp+ <dig> fusion in e. coli was dependent on gcva , we determined if the y. pestis gcva gene also encodes an activator protein for gcvb expression. we assumed this would be the case, as the e. coli and y. pestis gcva proteins are 88% identical at the amino acid sequence level. the y. pestis gcva gene was cloned into plasmid pacyc <dig> and tested for its ability to complement an e. coli gcva mutant. the e. coli strain gs <dig> carries a deletion of the gcva gene  <cit> . this strain was lysogenized with an e. coli λgcvb::lacz transcriptional gene fusion and subsequently transformed with the control plasmid pacyc <dig>  or pacyc <dig> carrying either the e. coli or the y. pestis gcva gene. the cells were grown in lb to mid-log phase of growth and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. as reported previously  <cit> , expression of the e. coli gcvb::lacz fusion was increased about 400-fold in the presence of the e. coli gcva gene . the y. pestis gcva gene also complemented the e. coli Δgcva strain, restoring gcvb::lacz expression to nearly the same level as seen with the e. coli gcva gene . these results show that the y. pestis gcva gene codes for an activator protein capable of activating expression of an e. coli gcvb::lacz fusion.

the y. pestis gcvr gene encodes a repressor protein for gcvb expression
since deletion of the gcvr gene in e. coli results in constitutive expression of the y. pestis gcvbyp+ <dig> fusion , we tested if the y. pestis gcvr gene encodes a repressor for gcvb expression. we assumed this would be the case, as the e. coli and y. pestis gcvr proteins are 75% identical at the amino acid sequence level. the e. coli strain gs <dig> carries a tn <dig> element inserted into the gcvr gene  <cit> . this strain was lysogenized with an e. coli λgcvb::lacz+ <dig> transcriptional gene fusion  <cit>  and subsequently transformed with the control plasmid pacyc <dig>  or pacyc <dig> carrying either the e. coli gcvr gene or the y. pestis gcvr gene. the cells were grown in gm media to mid-log phase of growth and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. expression of the e. coli gcvb::lacz fusion is constitutive in the absence of a functional gcvr protein . the gcvb::lacz fusion, however, was repressed in the presence of either pgs <dig>  carrying e. coli gcvr, or pgcvryp-p <dig>  carrying y. pestis gcvr .

in e. coli, the gcva and gcvr proteins interact to form a repressor complex  <cit> . the above results suggest that the y. pestis gcvr protein interacts with the e. coli gcva protein to form a repression complex. we tested if the y. pestis gcva and gcvr gene products also likely form a repressor complex to control expression of an e. coli gcvb::lacz fusion. strain gs1131λgcvb::lacz carries Δ gcvr Δgcva mutations. strain gs1131λgcvb::lacz was transformed with plasmid pgcvayp-p <dig>  pgcvryp-p <dig>  or both plasmids. the vectors for pgcvayp-p <dig> and pgcvryp-p <dig> are pacyc <dig> and pbr <dig>  respectively, to insure an excess of gcvryp versus gcvayp. the cells were grown in gm media + appropriate antibiotics, harvested in mid-log phase of growth and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. the y. pestis gcva gene complemented the Δgcva mutation, resulting in activation of the gcvb::lacz fusion . the y. pestis gcvr gene complemented the gcvr mutation, as repression of the gcvb::lacz fusion occurred in the pgcvayp-p <dig> pgcvryp-p <dig> double transformant . these results suggest that the gcva and gcvr proteins likely interact to form a repression complex in y. pestis. in e. coli, gcva also activates the gcvthp operon and gcva + gcvr repress the operon  <cit> . whether the y. pestis gcva and gcvr proteins also regulate the y. pestis gcvthp operon, or have additional regulatory roles, awaits further investigation.

the y. pestis gcvb rnas regulate the e. coli and y. pestis dppa genes
the e. coli gcvb gene negatively regulates the dppa and oppa genes  <cit> . in addition, many other genes were shown to be either negatively or positively regulated by the gcvb rnas  <cit> . thus, the e. coli gcvb rnas are likely global regulators of gene expression. y. pestis has homologs of dppa and oppa. to determine if the y. pestis gcvb rnas are regulatory, we transformed an e. coli Δ gcvb λdppa::lacz lysogen with pgcvbyp-p <dig>  the transformant and the parent lysogen were grown in lb to mid-log phase of growth and assayed for β-galactosidase levels. as expected, deletion of gcvb caused an increase in dppa::lacz expression . however, pgcvbyp-p <dig> complemented the e. coli Δ gcvb mutation, repressing the e. coli dppa::lacz fusion . thus, the y. pestis gcvb rnas regulate the e. coli dppa::lacz fusion. we then tested the regulatory activity of the gcvb rnas in y. pestis directly. a single-copy plasmid carrying a y. pestis dppa::lacz fusion was used to transform y. pestis strain kim <dig> and kim6Δ gcvb. the transformants were grown in hib + ap to mid-log phase of growth and assayed for β-galactosidase levels. deletion of the gcvb gene resulted in a  <dig> -fold increase in dppa::lacz expression . the results suggest that the y. pestis gcvb rnas are regulatory molecules. however, the mechanism of gcvb rna repression of dppa has not been determined. although there is a region of 13– <dig> nucleotides in the y. pestis gcvb rna that can potentially base-pair with both the e. coli and y. pestis dppa mrnas near their ribosome binding sites, further studies are necessary to determine if base-pairing of gcvb rna and dppa mrna is part of the regulatory mechanism. furthermore, in e. coli, the  <dig> nucleotide gcvb rna is required for repression of oppa and dppa  <cit> . we are constructing a plasmid that will only produce the  <dig> nucleotide y. pestis gcvb rna to determine whether the  <dig> or  <dig> nucleotide rna species is required for activity in y. pestis.

deletion of the y. pestis gcvb gene slows growth rate and alters colony morphology
the kim6Δ gcvb strain routinely gave smaller colonies on hib plates than the parent kim <dig> strain. thus, we investigated the growth of kim6Δ gcvb to determine the effect of the Δgcvb mutation on growth rate. the parent strain kim <dig>  kim6Δgcvb and kim6Δgcvb  were grown in hib broth at 37°c. the generation times were then calculated. the kim <dig> generation time at 37°c was  <dig> ±  <dig> minutes whereas kim6Δgcvb had a generation time of  <dig> ±  <dig> minutes . the presence of pgcvbyp-sc in kim6Δgcvb complemented the gcvb deletion, as the generation time was reduced to  <dig> ±  <dig> minutes, close to the generation time of strain kim <dig>  thus, deletion of the gcvb gene impairs the ability of y. pestis to grow as well as the parent strain on either solid media or in liquid media. this is in contrast to e. coli gcvb deletion mutants that have no observable phenotype. the kim6Δ gcvb strain also showed a different colony morphology from wt kim <dig>  wt kim <dig> colonies appear smooth and sticky, whereas the kim6Δ gcvb colonies appear dry and compact. the presence of pgcvbyp-sc in kim6Δgcvb again complemented the gcvb deletion, as the phenotype was restored back to the wt colony morphology.

in e. coli, many genes respond to the gcvb rnas  <cit> . the pleiotropic nature of the y. pestis gcvb deletion suggests that the y. pestis gcvb rnas are likely global regulators as well. identification of the specific genes regulated by the gcvb rnas that are responsible for the altered phenotype will allow us to test directly their involvement in virulence of the organism. in addition, the gcvb sequences and regulatory regions from bp - <dig> to + <dig>  which include the putative gcva binding sites for activation of gcvb, are 100% identical in all yersina pestis strains, and greater than 92% identical in other yersinia species. thus, expression of gcvb and the regulatory mechanisms of the gcvb rnas are likely similar in all yersinia species.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the y. pestis gcvb gene is activated by the gcva protein and repressed by the gcvr protein. the gcvb gene encodes two srnas that have regulatory activity, repressing dppa expression. a gcvb deletion is pleiotropic, suggesting that the gcvb rnas possibly serve as global regulators in y. pestis.
