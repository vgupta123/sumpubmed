BACKGROUND
the metazoan mitochondrial genome  usually consists of a single compact circular dna with a highly conserved gene content. it harbours the coding capacity for  <dig> proteins of four complexes of the respiratory chain, two ribosomal rnas, and  <dig> genes coding for the trna set, including two gene copies for each leucine and serine trnas  <cit> . a non-coding region  of variable length is also typically present ; this region provides the site for the initiation of transcription and the initiation of replication of one or both strands .

a wealth of data on dna sequence and gene organization of metazoan mitogenomes has been gathered in the last decades, with about  <dig> complete mitochondrial genomes already deposited in dna sequence databases , of which two thirds correspond to vertebrates  <cit> . data gathering has been fuelled by the advancements performed in “next generation sequencing” techniques and the need of generating robust phylogenetic information for evolutionary studies at all taxonomic levels, from deep metazoan evolution  <cit> , relationships among vertebrate orders  <cit> , or even to resolve species-level phylogenies after rapid radiation processes  <cit> .

up to now   <dig> crustacean mitogenomes have been completely sequenced,  <dig> of them corresponding to species in the class malacostraca . within the malacostracan peracarid order amphipoda, the sequences of species within the genera parhyale , caprella , onisimus , gondogeneia , gammarus , eulimnogammarus , pseudoniphargus , bahadzia  and metacrangonyx  have been reported or are deposited in sequence databases .

in a previous work we sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of several metacrangonyctid taxa by both classic and next-generation sequencing techniques to resolve, in combination with nuclear ribosomal sequences, the phylogenetic relationships within this family and to establish a time frame for its diversification  <cit> . the metacrangonyctidae is a phylogenetically enigmatic amphipod lineage composed of stygobiont  species with an extreme disjunct geographic distribution  <cit> . our phylogenetic reconstruction suggested that the major lineages of metacrangonyctidae diversified during the cretaceous, c. 96– <dig> million years ago , and that the diversification of an insular clade was compatible with vicariance by plate tectonics  <cit> . in the present study we aim to analyse in more detail the mitochondrial dna sequences of metacrangonyctidae, their genome organization and evolution and compare them to other amphipodan mitogenomes. aside of two species of caprella
 <cit> , the few known amphipod mitogenomes derive from species placed in distant genera and families. here we analyse  <dig> metacrangonyctid mitochondrial complete or nearly complete genome sequences , to explore their phylogenetic signal and to perform a comparative intra-familiar genomic analysis. we have compared them also with the mitogenomic features displayed by other amphipod families. we have paid particular attention to the role played by trnas and the secondary structure of the small/large ribosomal rnas and their nucleotide substitution patterns, since few data are available for these genes in crustaceans.

RESULTS
genome organization
in previous studies we obtained the sequence information and complete or nearly complete mitochondrial genome of  <dig> metacrangonyctid specimens belonging to  <dig> species plus six taxa that are not formally described yet, covering the entire geographical range of the family   <cit> . the sequence coverage of mitogenomes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  × for the shearing/shotgun sequencing approach, to between 80–178 × and 59–281 × for the roche gs junior and roche flx approaches, respectively . all mitochondrial dnas were circular molecules with a total size ranging  from  <dig>   to  <dig>  bp  . genome content comprised the typical metazoan mitochondrial gene set consisting of  <dig> genes , with  <dig> coded at the  strand and  <dig> at the  strand . mitochondrial gene order in all taxa was identical to that previously reported for m. longipes
 <cit> , where trnl <dig>  gene appears between cox <dig> and cox <dig> as in the putative pancrustacean  pattern. this pancrustacean pattern is assumed to derive from a translocation of this gene with respect to the arthropod presumed ground pattern, but it shows also many rearrangements compared to the hypothetical ancestral pancrustacean gene order . gene arrangement in metacrangonyctids is unique among the amphipoda although several gene blocks are conserved in most amphipods  <cit>  . the mitogenomes of other amphipods known, such as those of parhyale hawaiiensis
 <cit> , caprella scaura and c. mutica
 <cit> , gondogeneia antarctica
 <cit> , onisimus nanseni
 <cit> , gammarus duebeni
 <cit> , pseudoniphargus daviui and bahadzia jaraguensis
 <cit> , all show the gene string cox <dig> trnl <dig> ,cox <dig> trnk,trnd,atp <dig> atp <dig> cox <dig> conserved, except for a transposition of trnk,trnd in gondogeneia antarctica . in addition, the pancrustacean gene order nad <dig> trnh,nad <dig> nad4l is conserved at the same location of the  strand in all amphipod mitogenomes studied . however, in caprella scaura and c. mutica this gene arrangement is placed in a different position between the rrns gene and the control region, with the gene nad <dig> on the  strand. all amphipod species but p. hawaiiensis display also the string trna,trns <dig> ,trnn,trne,trnr, so this probably represents an apomorphic feature of the amphipoda  <cit> . all metacrangonyctid mitogenomes have the particularity of having the trns <dig>   and cob genes coded at the  strand next to the control region, flanked at the other side by a string of trnas and the nad <dig> gene. this gene order differs from the putative pancrustacean gene arrangement and is unique among amphipods . the breakpoint distances  calculated with crex  <cit>  between the hypothetical pancrustacean gene order and the amphipod gene arrangements are high, with a minimum distance of  <dig>  and a maximum of  <dig>  . therefore many rearrangements have occurred in this lineage making it difficult reconstructing the ancient events. the mitogenome of metacrangonyctidae have suffered at least four trna gene transpositions , the inversion of trnt, one inversion coupled with transposition of the string trns ,cob and two complex tandem duplications with subsequent random gene loss. the more similar gene orders are the ones of gammarus duebeni and eulimnogammarus verrucosus  only differing in the orientation of the rrnl gene .table  <dig>

mitochondrial genome maps of amphipoda. changes with respect to the hypothetical pancrustacean gene order are highlighted in grey. genes located above the central line correspond to genes coded on the  strand, whereas those coded on the  strand appear below. the dashed segment of the mitogenome of parhyale hawaiensis corresponds to accession numbers fm957525- <dig>  <cit> . the control region  of metacrangonyctidae is depicted in the middle line of the genome map to account for the uncertainty of in which strand lies the replication origin.



base composition and at- and gc-skews
the variation in at% across metacrangonyctid taxa  ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, with an average value of  <dig> % . this high at richness is typical of hexapodan species and appears also in many crustacean mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . the average whole mitogenome at-skew was - <dig> , with a variation ranging from - <dig>  to + <dig> . the average gc-skew was - <dig>   with most mtdnas displaying negative skews . figure  <dig> graphically depicts the at%, at- and gc-skews for the entire mitochondrial genomes across species. average at% variation for the protein-coding genes in all metacrangonyctid species ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   . three species  displayed similar significantly lower at-content . no particular trend was observed in at-content of genes placed at different strands. the atp <dig> gene showed the largest variation in at-content across species. two species, m. goulmimensis erfoud and “m. boutini boutini” displayed outlier lower at% values for most of the protein coding genes.figure  <dig>

metazoan mitogenomes show a marked strand bias in nucleotide composition, which is thought to be due to exposure to different mutational pressures during replication, transcription or during both processes  <cit> . most malacostracan mitogenomes exhibit a negative gc-skew for genes coded in the  strand and positive values for genes of the  strand  <cit> . the isopoda  seem to be an exception to this rule since their mitogenomes show a reversed pattern where most genes of the  strand have a positive gc-skew; i.e. more g than c. nevertheless, we have found that metacrangonyctid amphipod mitogenomes show gc-skew positive values at both  and  strands , with the exception of cob and nad <dig> genes. at-skew values are in turn negative for all protein-coding genes but atp <dig> , with genes coded on the  strand showing lower overall values than those coded on the  strand. the reversed strand bias pattern of isopodan mitogenomes and in general any other metazoan strand bias have been explained advocating to the occurrence of an inversion of the control region. this inversion presumably included the replication origin at the base of isopoda, changing the mutational pressure leading to strand-bias . the control region is placed between the rrns  and trny  genes in the amphipod completed mitogenomes . the segment assigned as the control region in metacrangonyctids is flanked also by rrns  but trns <dig> , followed by the cob gene are at the other side. it can be deduced that both trns <dig>  and cob have suffered a reverse transposition  respect to the hypothetical arrangement displayed by other amphipods suggesting that this could have caused an inversion of the control region in the metacrangonyctidae lineage. in the isopods eophreatoicus sp. and ligia oceanica, that show a similar strand bias pattern as metacrangonyctids, the control region appears between the trnq and trni genes  strand in l. oceanica while trni is at the  strand in eophreatoicus sp.). in any case, the strand bias pattern of metacrangonyctid mitogenomes is not only more similar to the condition found in the isopoda than to amphipods, but also to other non-peracarid crustaceans such as hutchinsoniella macracantha ; tigriopus californicus, t. japonicus, lepeophtheirus salmonis, calanus hyperboreous ; argulus americanus  and some decapods . all these species share with metacrangonyctids the display of a positive gc-skew in genes coded in the  strand . this suggests that the reversal of the ordinary strand bias has occurred independently multiple times, and not only in very distant metazoans  <cit>  but also within the crustacea, even within members of the same taxonomic order. this is presumably due to the fixation of different independent ancestral inversions of the same block of mitochondrial genes with respect to the control region, or vice versa  <cit> .nucleotide composition per codon site showed a sharp contrast between third and first/second positions, as expected . third codon positions displayed a high at-content with similar values at both strands  strand; 80% on  strand), and a large variation across species. in contrast, at-content at the first and second codon positions were lower and differed in genes coded on different strands, in particular the first codon positions. at skew was close to zero at first codon positions, second codon positions showed a t nucleotide-enrichment  in genes of both strands, whereas third codon positions showed intermediate negative at skews. gc skew per codon position was positive for first codon positions, slightly negative or close to zero for second codon positions, showing a substantial variation for third codon positions .

amino acid frequencies and codon usage
the analysis of amino acid frequencies indicate that five amino acids account for more than half of the total amino acid composition . overall amino acid frequency patterns were similar irrespective of the coding strand, with the more used amino acids showing a higher variation across species . similarly, a measure of the extent that synonymous codons depart from random usage  showed a conserved pattern in both strands, evidencing the high prevalence of a or t nucleotides at third codon positions . the effective number of codons  is another measure of the synonymous codon usage bias  <cit> . enc values averaged 40 ±  <dig>  for the  strand and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the , indicating that only about two-thirds of the possible codons are used in metacrangonyctid mitogenomes. the positive correlation between enc and gc content at third codon positions has been reported also in other mitochondrial genomes   <cit> . the influence of a strong compositional bias for a + t and highly biased codon usage has been also recently described in aphid mitogenomes  <cit> .figure  <dig>

protein coding gene phylogenetic informativeness
the phylogenetic informativeness approach  aims to determine the power of a gene  to resolve branching order in a particular time frame in a phylogenetic tree  <cit> . pi values for the  <dig> pcgs are relatively high from phylogenetically recent time up to 20– <dig> mya in the metacrangonyctid phylogenetic tree obtained elsewhere  <cit> , with third positions providing most of the phylogenetic informativeness  . saturation of nucleotide substitutions is mostly concentrated at third codon sites as expected, with phylogenetic signal dropping deeply in the phylogenetic tree from  <dig> to  <dig> mya. first and second codon sites, however, appear to maintain most of their weak phylogenetic signal through time. comparison of the pi values for the different protein-coding genes confirms the expectation that there is a positive correlation between phylogenetic informativeness and gene length. however, if a correction by length is applied, the atp <dig> gene shows the highest pi value, followed by nad <dig>  nad <dig> and nad <dig> . on the other hand, the less informative genes in terms of phylogenetic content when we take into account gene length are cox <dig>  cox <dig> and cox <dig>  interestingly, atp <dig> gene shows the highest pi for the first and second codon positions combined compared to any other pcgs . we can conclude that the genes with more accumulative phylogenetic informativeness are nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  cob and nad <dig>  while cox <dig> and cox <dig> are relatively poor in phylogenetic informativeness despite their prevalence in phylogenetic reconstruction studies. havird and santos  <cit>  have recently analysed a large metazoan mitogenomic data set concluding that nad <dig>  nad <dig> and nad <dig> genes were the more likely to reproduce the phylogeny obtained from concatenation of all  <dig> pcgs, while the popular marker cox <dig> and some of the other long pcgs were the less phylogenetically reliable at this deep taxonomic level. although particular genes can provide phylogenetic power at distinct divergence time intervals and be more informative in some lineages than others, our data agree with the analysis by  <cit>  in that genes of the nadh dehydrogenase subunits have in general more phylogenetic power than genes coding for the cytochrome subunits.figure  <dig>

non-synonymous/synonymous substitution rates
the pcgs of the  <dig> mitogenomes were used to estimate dn/ds ratios  by maximum likelihood, assuming rate constancy per codon site and branch. the ω value is a proxy of the intensity and type of natural selection acting on a particular protein, with expected values of ω as <  <dig>  =  <dig>  or >  <dig> under negative  selection, neutral evolution, or positive  selection, respectively. figure  <dig> shows the pairwise ω estimates for each of the  <dig> genes of the metacrangonyctid mitochondrial genome using the species phylogeny obtained by  <cit> . all ω values fall well below  <dig>  suggesting that metacrangonyctid mitochondrial protein-coding genes are under purifying selection, with cox <dig> and atp <dig> genes being submitted to the strongest and weakest negative selection, respectively. this has also been shown to be the case in other mitochondrial comparisons such as those established among parasitic nasonia wasps  <cit> , aphids  <cit> , xenopus species  <cit>  or among other vertebrate mitogenomes  <cit> . oliveira et al.  <cit>  noticed that atp <dig> amino acid substitutions accumulate three times faster than average mitochondrial pcgs in nasonia, suggesting that either positive or relaxed selection is acting on this gene. a similar pattern is observed for vertebrate mitogenomes, where the genes of the respiratory complex v  are under the least efficient selection while cytochrome b  and cytochrome oxidase genes  of the iii and iv respiratory complex are submitted to the most efficient purifying selection  <cit> . in metacrangonyctidae mitogenomes atp <dig> ω pairwise comparisons vary extensively , showing an overall  <dig>  value across the phylogenetic tree. this value is almost seven times higher than the one estimated for cox <dig>  the slowest evolving gene in the metacrangonyctid lineage in terms of non-synonymous substitutions, with ω =  <dig>  across the tree. this pattern is in accordance with the phylogenetic informativeness of both genes.figure  <dig>

start and stop codons
most pcgs displayed atn start codons, with atg and att as the most frequent . the rest of start codons found are considered as canonical for invertebrate mitochondrial pcgs, such as ttg, which is conserved in all metacrangonyctid mitogenomes except in m. remyi that shows the non-canonical ctg. in addition, the canonical start codon gtg is present in the atp <dig> gene of two species  instead of the atn displayed in the rest of metacrangonyctids. the taa complete or incomplete taa or taa stop codons are usually the norm in metacrangonyctid mitogenomes, although tag appears as the stop codon for the gene nad <dig> in the majority of species . incomplete stop codons are believed to be completed by post-transcriptional polyadenylation  <cit> .

trna structures
we identified all the expected  <dig> trna genes in the metacrangonyctid mitogenomes, some of them only after implementing a - <dig> cove score cut off and using bacterial or nematode mitochondrial trna models that lack the dhu or the tψc-loop arms. in this analysis, we annotated the gene trns <dig>  of m. longipes mallorca that was not found in the previous search  <cit> . all sequences could be folded into typical cloverleaf structures showing the anticodon triplets, although several lacked the dhu arm . thirteen trna genes were on the  strand while nine were on the  strand . trna length ranged from  <dig> to 64 bp in the reference species “metacrangonyx boveei”. figure  <dig> shows the secondary structures of the reference species and the conservation of primary sequence among metacrangonyctid trnas. four trnas  lacked the dhu stem, a helix that is highly conserved in the primary structure of other trnas. aberrant secondary trna structures with missing dhu and tΨc stems have been reported in other amphipods  <cit> . the dhu-domain of trna-serucn has been lost in almost all metazoans, while for trna-seragn has occurred preferentially within particular lophotrochozoan and ecdysozoan lineages, probably due to independent loss events  <cit> . the basic conserved structure of the remaining  <dig> trnas is composed of the amino acid acceptor stem , the dhu stem , dhu loop ; anticodon stem  and loop ; variable loop  and tΨc stem  and loop . the amino acid acceptor and dhu stems appear always separated by two nucleotides and the latter from the anticodon stem by one nucleotide. the two genes specifying trna-ser were relatively variable in sequence  showing only a high conservation of the anticodon loop sequence, while the two genes for trna-leu were the most conserved  . no clear conservation pattern was observed with respect to placement of genes on the  or  strand. based on the secondary structure estimation, 43% of nucleotide substitutions were deduced to be a < -- > g changes, 28% were t < -- > c and 19% a < -- > t, with most substitutions deduced to correspond to compensatory mutations occurring at stems . compensatory nucleotide substitutions have been previously described in other ribosomal sequences such rrnas and viral rna  <cit> . several mismatched pairs were observed at stems . it has been proposed that post-transcriptional mechanisms can mend and transform into fully functional those trnas with non-watson-crick matches or displaying other aberrant characteristics  <cit> .figure  <dig>

mitogenomic spacers
a total of eighteen different sequence spacers  were inferred to occur across the studied mitogenomes. their length varied between  <dig> and 246 bp, although most of them were short 1–3 bp spacers . six genome spacers appear to be conserved since they are placed in the same position in almost all species, suggesting an ancestral common origin although the primary sequences are not conserved. two of these spacers are intergenic sequences separating pcgs: ish has  <dig> or 3 bp and is situated between cox <dig> and nad <dig> and isl, placed between nad <dig> and nad <dig>  varies from  <dig> to 246 bp. the mitogenome of m. goulmimensis  has the longest isl due to  <dig> perfect repeats of the motive aaatttattt flanked by non-repetitive regions of  <dig> and 12 bp, respectively, while the spacer in the mitogenome of m. goulmimensis  forms a palindrome capable of forming a stem of 26 bp. in turn, the isl spacer of “m. notenboomi” is 73 bp long, of which 51 bp possibly derive from a duplication of the 3′ end of the gene nad <dig> . all other genomic spacers are located between trna genes. the mitogenome of m. spinicaudatus shows a unique internal spacer  of 173 bp between trnr and trnf genes; it could have originated from duplication since it shows a 73% similarity with gene trnd. the long inverted repeats present in mitogenomic spacers have been interpreted in some cases as an extra origin of replication . in other cases, spacers could be just remnants of a duplication process produced by slipped strand mispairing or imprecise termination during replication  <cit> .

control region
the non-coding unassigned region located between the rrns and trns <dig>  genes in all mitogenomes show the expected characteristics of control regions such as a high a-t content, presence of a secondary structure with t-rich loops, plus repetitive elements and palindromes  <cit> . this region displays also the lowest gc-skew, a feature indicative of the presence of the origin of replication  <cit> . the complete control region was obtained for eight mitogenomes and showed an at-richness in the range  <dig> -100% and lengths between  <dig> and 963 bp. although variable in size and sequence, all control regions showed five common features  <cit> ; namely: i) a tata motif followed by ii) a 14– <dig> poly-t stretch; iii) a variable region  capable of forming one or several stem-loop structures; iv) a 10– <dig> poly-a stretch and v) a gant motif embedded in the trnsucn gene . the variable region of m. goulmimensis  comprises one motif of 216 bp followed by the sequence in inverted orientation . m. spinicaudatus has flanking repeats with inverted orientation of 93 bp . seemingly, “m. boveei” shows a long inverted repeat of 378 bp . in some mitogenomes these palindromes could have in part originated from a short tandem repeat, such as in the mitochondrial genome of m. goulmimensis  where five monomers of 24 bp show a  <dig> % identity . two of the mitogenomes  showed minimal and similar control regions with the motif 14–1513– <dig> as they lack the variable region and show a secondary structure identical to the one deduced for m. longipes   <cit>  . similar structures have been described in the control regions of the isopods armadillium vulgare and a. pelagicum
 <cit> .

rrnsand rrnlstructure
metacrangonyctid mitogenomes show the large and small rrna subunits placed as in the ancestral pancrustacean gene order  <cit> , i.e. between the trnl <dig>  and the trnv genes  and between the trnv and the control region . the boundaries of the two rrnas were tentatively established in our taxa by alignment with published annotated ribosomal rnas, although the 5′ and 3′ ends were found to be quite divergent among taxa. the rrns sequences ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nts, while the gene rrnl attained lengths between  <dig> and  <dig> nts. the predicted structure of the small and large mitochondrial rnas of the species “metacrangonyx boveei”, taken as representative of the metacrangonyctidae, are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . these, to our knowledge, are the first predicted mitochondrial ribosomal structures ever shown for an amphipod, and the second for a crustacean. the deduced rrns structure shows the three conserved domains displayed by metazoan 12s rnas and in particular by the crustacean artemia franciscana   <cit>  and all insect species whose 12s rna structure has been determined  <cit>  and references therein) . despite the considerable sequence dissimilarity between both taxa, there are several highly conserved sequence motifs common to artemia and the metacrangonyctid 12s rna; namely: in the loop at domain i presumably involved in tertiary folding , in three helices at domain ii and in most of the primary sequence of domain iii . the high conservation of primary sequences and structure in domain iii has been reported also from hexapod mitogenomes  <cit> . the fourteen complete metacrangonyctid rrns sequences obtained showed an average  <dig> % at content. the multiple alignment consisted of  <dig> positions, of which  <dig> were conserved , with domain iii being the most conserved region . figure  <dig> depicts the pattern of conservation of particular positions among metacrangonyctid rrns sequences, suggesting that regions conserved in artemia franciscana are also highly conserved in the different metacrangonyctid species. notice that the nucleotide positions capable of interacting into tertiary structures are coincident with those proposed for the artemia franciscana rrns structure.figure  <dig>

the rrnl sequences were similarly at-rich  and the inferred secondary structures showed the five canonical domains  displayed in all metazoans and absence of domain iii as in all arthropods  <cit>  . the metacrangonyctid rrnl multiple alignment comprised a total of  <dig> positions, of which  <dig> were conserved . domains i and ii were the most variable, showing only  <dig> and 25% identical positions, respectively, while domains iv, v and vi were more conserved  . a similar conservation pattern is shown in neuropterid insects 16s rnas  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the analysed metacrangonyctid mitochondrial genomes have a conserved gene order with a diagnostic translocation of the trns <dig>  and cob genes. this gene order differs from the pancrustacean gene arrangement and is unique among amphipods. in addition, pcgs show a reversed strand mutational bias pattern with gc-skew positive values at both strands except for two genes , while codon usage seems to be influenced by base composition and strand mutational bias. the atp <dig> gene displays the highest non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio, being the more phylogenetically informative per position due to the frequent occurrence of non-synonymous changes at first and second codon positions. purifying selection appears to have been stronger on genes of the cytochrome oxidase respiratory complex, in particular the cox <dig> gene as shown for other mitogenomes. trna genes show a mutation dynamics similar to other metazoans, with frequent compensatory mutations at stems. aberrant secondary structures lacking the d-stem have been determined in several metacrangonyctid trnas. at-rich control regions, albeit quite variable in length, show common features and sequence motifs that can be related to their possible role as the replication origin. the rrns and rrnl secondary structures of a reference metacrangonyx mitogenome have been modelled based on the structures determined elsewhere in artemia and sequence conservation within metacrangonyctidae mapped on the obtained structures. these structures are similar to those shown in other arthropods, where conservation is concentrated at certain segment domains. to our knowledge these are the first rrns and rrnl secondary structures determined for a peracarid and second for a crustacean.
