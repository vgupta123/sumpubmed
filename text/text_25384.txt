BACKGROUND
musical ability as a term is used to describe the sensitivity for music, the ability to understand music, and/or the ability to produce music. there is no standard definition, and it is hard to measure musical ability. one can only measure how well a person can perceive musical stimuli such as small changes in pitch, loudness, rhythm, and other sub-domains of music processing. it is generally accepted that some people show higher musical ability than others. but what are the correlates for the term ‘musical ability’ in the human brain? what are the differences between people with and without musical ability?

these questions and many others about music and music processing in the human brain have been a subject of interest in neuroscience research. the methods used in this field range widely from eeg, event-related potentials , magnetic resonance imaging  to the different methods of functional imaging. the processing of auditory stimuli and the differences in such processing between musicians and non-musicians have been investigated especially by means of auditory erp which can objectively quantify latencies of stimulus processing. this evaluation is regarded as a measure for the quality of some aspects of cognitive processing such as stimulus evaluation, cognitive processing speed and internal short-term memory functions.

in general, rare target stimuli and frequent non-target stimuli are presented to subjects in erp studies. the latencies and amplitudes of the potentials evoked by the target stimuli are analyzed such as the mismatch negativity  in auditory erp studies and the p <dig> in both visual and auditory erp studies. in previous music research studies, the subjects were either professional and non-professional musicians, people with absolute pitch, or non-musicians.

looking at the results of different studies , one can sum up that musicians with absolute pitch ability and musicians with relative pitch seem to have a shorter p <dig> latency in the auditory evoked erp and also a smaller p <dig> amplitude than non-musicians. the p <dig> could even not be found at all in some musicians with absolute pitch  <cit>  when the method that led to a p <dig> signal in all musicians with relative pitch was the discrimination between major thirds as non-target and minor thirds as target stimuli. in a timbre discrimination study  <cit> , subjects with absolute pitch showed a shorter p <dig> latency and a smaller p <dig> amplitude than other musicians and non-musicians. the subjects had to differentiate between the sound of a tone with the same pitch played on a viola or a cello, on two different kinds of flutes and on two different kinds of tubas. in the last  part, the musicians showed a significantly shorter p <dig> latency than the non-musicians.

in a different approach, a piano phrase by bach was used for eliciting erp  <cit> . they presented the original phrase  or the same phrase with an inharmonic note  or the same phrase with an unexpected mordent  to a group of musicians and a group of non-musicians. a shorter p <dig> latency for musicians could not be shown, but instead of that and among other results, a shorter n <dig> latency was detected. in a study in  <dig>  <cit> , the reaction time of musicians was shorter in comparison to non-musicians when the subjects had to discriminate between small differences in frequency. further, it was incidentally found a significantly decreased p3a latency in musicians  compared to non-musicians, evoking the p <dig> by means of pitch deviants  <cit> . the p3a signal was suggested to be a sensitive index of musical expertise.

all in all, the studies mentioned above suggest a faster discrimination of auditory stimuli in musicians . none of the studies had analyzed the latencies of visually evoked erp, and only two  <cit>  have measured the amplitudes of the visually evoked p <dig> latency in subjects with absolute pitch, which was not found to be changed.

we raised the question whether people with absolute pitch have a different cognitive stimulus processing as measured by erp, and not just a different processing of auditory stimuli, as most of the studies mentioned above suggest. in an experiment with three participating groups , our group was able to show that both people with absolute pitch compared to non-musicians and musicians compared to non-musicians show a significantly decreased p <dig> latency in the auditory and visually evoked erp  <cit> . the p <dig> amplitudes were not significantly different. in a similar study, our group was able to show a significantly decreased auditory and visually evoked p <dig> latency in musicians as well as a larger amplitude of the p <dig> in the auditory domain  <cit> .

in the present study, we were interested in aspects of the specific visual cognitive processing in musicians versus non-musicians. in particular, we aimed to correlate the erp results of visual and auditory stimulus processing with musical ability as evaluated by a psychometric measure. we chose an oddball paradigm since this is a very easy task not detracting the probands too much. furthermore, oddball paradigms are often used in research on musical cognitive processing in the past. since a specific cognitive processing of erp has been shown for auditory stimuli, a similar result for visual stimuli would suggest that musical ability is associated with a specific cognitive processing in all modalities.

RESULTS
as shown in table  <dig>  there were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to age and the scores of the zerssen scale. all subjects showed a normal mental well-being. this is important since feeling unwell could impair the results of the musical testing.table  <dig> data at baseline of the two subject groups

the latencies in the auditory erp showed similar differences between the two groups: the p <dig> latency in the musician group was 328 ± 34 ms as opposed to 360 ± 10 ms in the non-musician group . the p <dig> latency habituation differed by  <dig>  ms between the two groups with a p <dig> habituation of − <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms in the group of musicians .

we further calculated the correlation between the results in the seashore test and the p <dig> latencies. as shown in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  there was a negative correlation between the p <dig> latency of the visual erp and the total score of the seashore test , as well as between the p <dig> latency of the auditory erp and the total score of the seashore-test . this means that a higher musical ability is correlated to a shorter visual and auditory p <dig> latency.fig.  <dig> correlation between p <dig> latency of the visual event-related potentials and the total score of the seashore-test

discussion
testing musical ability
in the amusia test, the musicians scored significantly higher than the non-musicians, except for the categories ‘emotion’ and ‘identification of melodies’. the purpose of this amusia test was to rule out a clinically relevant amusia in the non-musician group. the average score of  <dig> is within the normal range of > <dig>  <cit> . therefore, the non-musician group did not have a relevant impairment of musical ability. one has to take into account that this test has a high ceiling effect and was not designed for measuring small interindividual differences in musical ability, although different categories of musical ability are tested. this explains why in two of the categories the results were not significantly different between musicians and non-musicians; and this is also the reason why we used the seashore test results for further analysis of musical ability and the correlation analysis with the p <dig> latencies.

the musicians scored significantly higher in the seashore-test. this confirms that the group of musicians has a higher musical ability than the group of non-musicians. but what are the reasons for this? several studies have investigated the question whether a higher degree of musical ability in musicians could be a result of practice-induced cortical plasticity or an innately given talent .

in two studies  <cit> , non-musicians who had learned to play a certain rhythmical sequence or different melodic sequences showed an increased mmn in response to rhythm or pitch incongruities. another group of non-musicians, who had just listened to the other group practising, did not show an increased mmn response. the authors interpret this finding as a sign of practice-induced cortical plasticity. therefore, we assume that the musicians’ higher score in the seashore test is a result of the musical training of 14 ± 2 years on average, although parts of the musical ability could also be a genetically driven talent.

it was shown that professional musicians compared to amateur and non-musicians have an increase in grey matter volume in several brain regions such as motor, visual-spatial, and especially auditory regions  <cit> . because of the associations found between structural differences, musician status, and practice intensity, the authors interpret their results as practice-induced adaptations of the brain. in  <dig>  changes induced by private keyboard lessons in young children who had no prior musical training were studied  <cit> : the results showed that instrumental children  showed a greater size of certain motor and auditory areas after 15 months of training and that their outcomes in motor and melody/rhythm tests also improved significantly. again, this supports the hypothesis of practice-induced musical skills going along with structural brain changes.

p <dig> latency and musical ability
the p <dig> response to the target stimuli of both the visual and auditory erp was significantly earlier in the group of musicians. this result confirms the results of previous studies  <cit> . an early p <dig> response indicates fast stimulus processing and discrimination. thus, musicians seem to be able to discriminate faster between auditory stimuli. considering their long and special exposition to auditory stimuli in form of practising and listening to music, this result does not seem surprising.

even though the mechanisms that determine latency of the p <dig> response have not yet been fully understood, there are several studies which have shown differences in the  brain structures of musicians. several studies suggest a practice-induced brain plasticity and thus a functional and structural difference in auditory brain areas of musicians versus non-musicians . the fact that musicians show an earlier p <dig> latency than non-musicians and thus have a faster auditory stimulus processing may be associated with those results. supporting this notion, a negative correlation between p <dig> latency and the years of musical training was found  <cit> .

in our study, not only the auditory p <dig> latency was earlier in musicians but also the visual p <dig> latency. musical training and/or musical ability therefore seem to affect also the visual perceptive system. this also goes along with the results of other studies concerning the musicians’ visual abilities. it was shown that musicians outperformed non-musicians in the ability of perceptual speed, which requires quick visual information processing  <cit> . visual memory was also reported to be better in musicians than in non-musicians ; even primary visual perception  <cit>  and somatosensory cognitive processing  <cit>  were reported to be enhanced in musicians. however, these studies used psychometric measures and did not evaluate cognitive processing in an objective way. a difference in grey matter volume in visual-spatial areas was found  <cit> , going along with other results  <cit>  indicating an improvement of visual-spatial tasks in musically trained children.

correlation of seashore test results and p <dig> latency
in our study, we were also able to link the early p <dig> responses in the auditory and visual paradigms to the results of the seashore-test and found a negative correlation between the data. in studies on musicians, a musician is usually defined as a subject who has learned to play an instrument for a certain amount of years and musicians can be classified as ‘professional’ or ‘amateur’. these definitions usually are the criteria for the participation of musicians in studies, but having had music lessons for a certain amount of years does not necessarily yield in a high musical ability. with our results, we showed that not just the status ‘musicianship’, but the amount of musical ability as measured by a psychometric test is related to the improved cognitive processing of musicians versus non-musicians.

all in all, people with high musical ability seem to have a faster auditory and visual cognitive processing. the question is, however, whether this connection between musical ability and cognitive processing is inherited or whether the acquisition of musical ability  leads to an enhancement of cognitive processing. at this time, one can only speculate about the answer: on the one hand, fast cognitive processing is probably helpful for learning an instrument, which requires fast interaction of auditory, motor, and visual stimuli. one could even conjecture that musical ability is a congenital ability of cognitive processing. some studies have shown evidence that the conditions upon which musical ability develops are innately predetermined. hassler for example showed that a certain androgynous level of testosterone is characteristic of musicians, and that differences between musicians and non-musicians are possibly formed prenatally under the influence of hormones  <cit> .

on the other hand it also seems plausible that by practicing an instrument the processing of all these stimuli becomes faster, which then might lead to the improvement of auditory and visual abilities, as shown in the studies mentioned above. in an meg study, an enhanced auditory evoked magnetic field response concerning violin tones was shown in children who had been musically trained for 1 year  <cit> . there has also been a study not connected to music, which showed alterations in adults’ erp in response to an auditory discrimination task  <cit> . hence, it has been shown before that training can have an influence on stimulus processing and therefore it is plausible that musical training which leads to a higher amount of musical ability could have an effect on auditive and visual processing  <cit> .

all in all we suppose that there might be certain inherited conditions such as fast cognitive processing upon which musical ability develops but that a stimulating environment as well as long-term musical practice also leads to an improvement of cognitive processing and/or aptitude. this is also important for disturbances of cognition e.g. after stroke, after brain injury, or in different types of amusia  <cit> .

p <dig> latency habituation
in our study, we calculated the p <dig> latency habituation and found that musicians showed a habituation for both the visual and the auditory latencies close to zero, whereas in non-musicians it was significantly higher. there is evidence that, in normal subjects, the visual and auditory p <dig> latency increases over trial blocks . a loss of habituation in the visual p <dig> latency of migraine patients during the migraine interval was shown  <cit> , similar to our findings of a loss of habituation in musicians. we believe that the loss of habituation and the generally decreased p <dig> latency in musicians indicate that musicians have a remarkable cognitive processing with the ability of keeping the processing of stimuli faster for a longer time than normal subjects. this could be an indicator of an improved working memory in musicians, as it has been reported by some authors  <cit> . keeping the results from migraine patients in mind, it would be interesting to study whether in musicians a similar effect like the normalization of the habituation during a migraine attack could be observed after an interval of increased alertness.

a loss of cognitive habituation  also means that stimuli on different levels might be processed faster and more accurate for a certain amount of time. this can be regarded as an advantage for musicians, e.g. when playing in an orchestra or playing both complex rhythmic and complex melodic music.

limitations
our study has some limitations which have to be considered when interpreting our results. first of all, the concept of musical ability is still under discussion. there is no clear definition and no commonly accepted measure to evaluate musical ability. the sub-domains of musical ability as measured in both the seashore test and the amusia test only include some aspects of musical ability which are commonly accepted as basic skills of musical ability ; other aspects such as creativity, emotional perception of music, the ability of interpreting music etc. are not included because these aspects are hard to measure in an objective way. nonetheless, they determine the amount of one’s musical ability. we accept that our study did not comprise all aspects of musical ability.

a second problem is the procedure of testing musical ability. the test results depend strongly on the cooperation and motivation of the subjects, which in turn is hard to evaluate. this leads to a reduced objectivity of the testing of musical ability.

third, when looking at the p <dig> latency results one has to consider that they only apply to our testing range. since we looked at p <dig> latencies that were within in the normal range and only included healthy subjects one cannot transfer the results of the correlation analysis to subjects with pathological p <dig> latencies, i.e. pathological p <dig> latencies certainly do not yield in a total lack of musical ability.

fourth, it is not clear whether or to which extent a decreased p <dig> latency has an impact on everyday life. a decreased p <dig> latency implies a faster cognitive processing. some authors suggest an improved working memory, but there is still an ongoing discussion about this .

CONCLUSIONS
our most important finding is that measures in tests of musical ability are associated with decreased latencies in auditory and visual erp suggesting that musical ability is associated with a general enhancement of cognitive processing.

regarding the auditory p <dig> latency, we were able to reproduce findings of previous studies . additionally, we were able to show a significant correlation between the level of musical ability as measured by the seashore test and both the visual and the auditory p <dig> latency. also, a significant difference in habituation of the visual and auditory p <dig> latencies between non-musicians and musicians could be observed. these results cannot be attributed to a different mental state of the two groups, as this would have lead to significantly different results between the two groups in the zerssen self-rating scale.
