BACKGROUND
regarding adaptation to infectious diseases, genes of the major histocompatibility complex  are the most commonly studied in mammals. mhc genes play a significant role in the functionality and effectiveness of the immune response of vertebrates and are directly involved in fitness and adaptation of hosts to their pathogens  <cit> . therefore, studying mhc gene diversity in non-model animals, known to be reservoirs of pathogens, is a critical tool to assess its evolutionary process and implication in  the variation of individual fitness,  population viability and  evolutionary potential in a changing environment  <cit> . studies have essentially focused on the genetic variability of exon  <dig> of the mhc class ii dr beta  gene given that this exon encodes the peptide-binding region   <cit> . hence, most of the variability displayed is recorded on this exon. variations within the pbr define the repertoire of antigenic determinants and subsequently the ability to recognize a variable number of circulating pathogens  <cit> . optimum resistance to pathogens is, therefore, the result of all intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence the genetic variability of individuals’ immune system  <cit> . most of the vertebrate populations studied so far exhibited high levels of mhc diversity both in the number of alleles and in their heterozygosities and allelic variation . pathogen-driven balancing selection and sexual selection seem to play a fundamental role in the preservation of this high level of polymorphism  <cit> . pathogen-driven balancing selection acts through antagonistic host–parasite coevolution via several mechanisms: overdominant and frequency-dependent selection  <cit> , as well as spatial and temporal variation in host pathogens  <cit> . sexual selection pressures encompass mechanisms such as maternal–fetal interactions  <cit>  and mate selection  <cit> . however, when assessing the genetic variability of both neutral markers and mhc genes, studies have highlighted the role of past demographic processes  in shaping the pattern of mhc variability that can sometimes surpass that of natural selection .

local immunogenetic adaptation of hosts that live in different environments was associated with different parasite and pathogen pressures . indeed, differences in the diversity of pathogens  are directly linked to environmental components. these latter  modulate parasite and pathogen species richness, their survival and adaptability, as well as their distribution, transmission, developmental success and their ability to induce diseases  <cit> . environmental components likewise impact the richness, population dynamics, immunocompetence and nutritional status of host species, all of which subsequently determine resistance or susceptibility to disease  <cit> . a strong correlation was also shown between host and parasite species richness, their life history and ecological traits . moreover, anthropogenic alterations of habitats induce changes in host–pathogen–environment interactions and are consequently linked to the emergence of infectious zoonotic diseases . therefore, considering the role of the environment is critical for the assessment of mhc gene variability.

bats  are the second largest species-rich mammalian order, accounting for 20 % of all mammal species in the world. compared to other mammals, their uncommon biological features  and their long-term evolutionary history with pathogens make them excellent reservoirs and spreaders of viruses , which have a significant impact on both human and animal health  <cit> . however, bats rarely exhibit clinical or pathological signs of diseases and appear to coexist with their pathogens in a disease-free state, characteristic of reservoir hosts  <cit> . at the order level, the monophyly of chiroptera was evidenced via phylogenetic relationships inferred from intron sequences of drb  <cit> . the monophyletic origin of drb genes was also evidenced at the family level via phylogenetic relationships inferred from drb sequences from saccopteryx bilineata, myotis spp., noctilio spp. and carollia perspicillata  <cit> . other studies, investigating the diversity of mhc drb, showed significant differences in the polymorphism of mhc genes between species. this polymorphism was essentially influenced by  a pathogen-driven selection  <cit> ,  a social structure driven by mhc-mediated post-copulatory mechanisms  <cit> ,  diversifying selection and recombination events  <cit>  and  geographical constraints resulting in spatial variation of pathogen-mediated selection and enhanced susceptibility to environmental changes  <cit> .

the amazon, a major biodiversity hotspot in south america, possesses a large diversity of bat species and pathogens in a wide variety of climates and vegetation formations  <cit> . french guiana, a tropical amazonian region near the equatorial zone, harbors a great diversity of bats, with  <dig> species registered  <cit> . in this region, the impact of deforestation on the composition and dynamics of bat communities was assessed  <cit>  as well as, the role of habitats on rabies virus circulation and maintenance  <cit> .

in this study, we analyzed the genetic variability of the expressed mhc class ii drb exon  <dig> in three bat species: two phyllostomidae, carollia perspicillata and desmodus rotundus, and one molossidae, molossus molossus. these three widely distributed species have ecological plasticity and tolerance to disturbance. in french guiana, these species are sympatric and use the same habitats .

the key hypothesis of this study was that composition and distribution of mhc drb alleles were specific to the environments , rather than randomly distributed in space. consequently, we should observe local immunogenetic adaptation to the contrasting pathogen pressures or equally adapted alleles. to assess which are the best factors that predict the mhc diversity, pathogen-mediated selection, recombination, gene conversion, demographic history and population structure were investigated.

there is a higher diversity of microorganisms in forest environments, compared to disturbed environnments, due to greater host species richness and better transmission-promoting parameters  <cit> . for this reason, we expect higher levels of mhc diversity in forest environments facing lower disturbance pressures, where higher parasite and pathogen diversities imply a higher selection pressure. furthermore, assuming that bats using the same roosting area and/or the same foraging areas would be subjected to similar pathogen pressures, we should observe similar trends in intra- and inter-specific mhc diversity. in contrast, once the demographic neutral genetic histories—which may also influence mhc diversity—are controlled, we should observe differences in selective histories between bats inhabiting different environments.

to identify different signatures of selection in the drb exon  <dig>  which would imply area-specific recognition capabilities, conformation of the hla-drb <dig> was used as a reference to detect putative sites directly involved in antigen binding  and consequently subjected to selection. additionally, to reduce the misidentification bias of abs, the selection signature within the pbr was investigated without a priori identifying species-specific abs for further comparisons.

mhc genes exhibit high levels of allele similarity within species as well as between related species and the occurrence of identical mhc alleles in related species is frequent. convergence and trans-species polymorphism are thought to be responsible for this trans-species evolution. to highlight which of these two mechanisms acts predominantly on the evolutionary history of the drb gene in the three species investigated, phylogenetic relationships were inferred from the drb sequences obtained here and with other available chiropteran sequences. finally, mhc spatial diversity was compared to that of neutral markers  to highlight the impact of demographic processes and population structure on the diversity pattern in the three bat species investigated.

methods
ethics statement
animals were captured, handled, sampled and, whenever necessary, euthanized following asm guidelines  <cit>  under the supervision of researchers who had been granted the french “expérimentation animale niveau 1” diploma. bats are not protected by law in french guiana; however, the project was submitted to the conseil scientifique régional pour le patrimoine naturel de la guyane and approved. captures that occurred within protected areas  received approval by the conseil scientifique régional du patrimoine naturel on  <dig> january  <dig> and ad-hoc authorizations .

study areas, sample collection, dna and rna extraction
the three bat species  were sampled at  <dig> sites. three sites were located in pristine lowland forests  with low disturbance pressure, four sites were located in edge habitats , five in anthropized areas , and two in urban and periurban areas  .fig.  <dig> map of sampling sites of all individuals used in this study across four environments. for clarity, nearby collecting sites within 15 km were grouped. sites are numbered and labeled according to the type of environment to which they correspond: edge habitats , anthropized areas , pristine primary lowland forests , urban and periurban areas . pie charts indicate the proportion of the most frequent alleles ; dero-drb* <dig> and  <dig> for d. rotundus ; momo-drb* <dig> for m. molossus ), other shared alleles and private alleles  in each collecting sites/environments, for each species: c. perspicillata , d. rotundus  and m. molossus 




bats were trapped with mist nets erected near breeding sites, roosts, at forest edges, around livestock, or through putative foraging courses. bat species were identified in the field using external morphology and, prior to release, a brachial vein puncture and wing biopsies were performed. a few individuals captured were euthanized at the laboratory to collect organs. a total of  <dig> c. perspicillata,  <dig> d. rotundus and 42 m. molossus were sampled.

nucleic acids were extracted from blood, liver or spleen depending on sampling. extractions were performed using the nuclisens easymag bio-robot .

amplification and genotyping of the mhc class ii drb gene
all amplifications of mhc drb genes for the three species were performed using cdna obtained from liver and spleen rnas. all cdnas were synthesized using superscript® iii reverse transcriptase  and random hexamers  following the manufacturer’s recommendations. expressed mhc drb genes of the three bat species were amplified by a minimum of two independent polymerase chain reactions  using a standard procedure with the amplitaq gold dna polymerase pcr kit . to optimize the detection of different alleles, a minimum of two distinct pcrs per individual were performed. species-specific primers were designed for c. perspicillata and d. rotundus to avoid occurrence of non-amplifying alleles . to amplify the m. molossus drb gene, primers designed by richman et al.  <cit>  were modified. primers located in conserved parts of exon  <dig> , exon  <dig> , exon  <dig>  and exon  <dig>  were used to amplify functional mhc class ii drb alleles from the cdna of three bats from each species, c. perspicillata, d. rotundus and m. molossus. the sequences obtained were used to design specific primers complementary to conserved parts of exon  <dig>  and batcmhiif. <dig> , table 1) and exon  <dig>  and batcmhiir. <dig> , table 1). the primer combinations f-r and f1-r <dig> were used as the first pcr for d. rotundus and c. perspicillata . for the second pcr, all of the newly designed primers were used together with jsex <dig> , ex1rd, ex3rd and l <dig> in different combinations to screen the cdna of a total of  <dig> c. perspicillata and  <dig> d. rotundus . two different primer combinations with js2cape, ex3rd, r and r <dig> were used to amplify the drb alleles from the cdna of 40 m. molossus . the pcr products were cloned using the pcr™4-topo® ta cloning® kit . ten clones per pcr amplification were sent for sequencing to beckman coulter genomics  using t <dig> and t <dig> primers.table  <dig> pcr primers used to amplify mhc class ii dr beta loci in the three species investigated: c. perspicillata, d. rotundus and m. molossus

amplification and sequencing of the mtdna d-loop
all amplifications of mitochondrial dna  control region  for the three species were performed using genomic dna. the primers f and p  <cit>  were used to amplify the hypervariable domain hvi of mtdna d-loop. pcrs were performed using a standard procedure with biotaq™ dna polymerase pcr kit . sequencing was carried out by beckman coulter genomics  using f and p primers.

sampling analysis
to assess the environmental impact on the mhc class ii drb diversity, the data were analyzed according to the location of the capture sites and the type of environment at these sites. for d. rotundus and m. molossus, each capture site corresponded to one environment type. d. rotundus sampling sites corresponded to two different roots  and cave m ), considered as pf sites, and one foraging area ), an eh site . m. molossus individuals were captured in one foraging area ), an aa site, and two different roosts located at the eh site with different disturbance levels: paracou  with a high level of disturbance and the sa site with a low level of disturbance . c. perspicillata individuals were captured in the four types of environments pf, eh, aa and ur . to explore the potential bias induced by the spatial structure of collecting sites in c. perspicillata samples, spatial structure was compared with environment structure.

data analysis
sequences were edited using geneious r <dig>  <cit> . dna sequences were aligned using the mafft alignment tool  <cit>  included in the software. sequences were confirmed as mhc class ii drb and mtdna d-loop by homology analysis using the ncbi blast search  <cit> . a drb clone sequence was regarded as valid if the following criteria were met:  incidence in at least two independent pcrs either from the same individual or different ones, or amplification by two different primer pairs, and  identified by at least three identical clones  <cit> . haplotypes were reconstructed for each bat species using the dnasp  <dig>  <cit> . as proposed by  <cit> , the nomenclature of mhc alleles for non-human species was used: to each allele a prefix  was given, with the serial number attached as follows: cape-drb for c. perspicillata, dero-drb for d. rotundus and momo-drb for m. molossus. cape-drb alleles identified in this study were named after the  <dig> alleles previously described by  <cit> .

sequence diversity
allele frequencies , proportion of segregating sites , nucleotide diversity , observed  and expected  heterozygosities, and gene diversity  were estimated using arlequin  <dig>   <cit> . allelic richness , with a correction for sample size using a rarefaction method and inbreeding coefficients  were calculated using fstat  <dig> .  <cit> . the mean number of differences between nucleotide and amino acid alleles were counted using mega  <dig>   <cit> . analyses were performed per species for the entire dataset, and for each environment subgroup separately.

gene conversion and recombination events
evidence of genetic recombination or gene conversion events between drb sequences was assessed using geneconv  <dig> a  <cit> . this program detects lengthy patterns shared between sequences despite the existence of a pronounced polymorphism. p-values were determined from both global and pairwise permutation tests, with  <dig>  replicates. no mismatches between fragments were accepted, and global p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons . recombination breakpoints were identified using the gard and sbp algorithms  <cit>  implemented in the hyphy package  <cit> , available in the standard datamonkey analysis library .

codon-based analysis of positive selection
putative antigen-binding sites  were identified by comparison with the human abs of the hla-drb <dig>  <cit> . the relative rates of dn and ds substitutions were calculated for putative abs, non-abs and all codons following the method of nei and gojobori with the jukes and cantor correction for multiple hits  <cit> . a z-test was performed to assess the deviation of the dn/ds  ratio from  <dig> . these tests were performed using mega  <dig> .

codons potentially subjected to positive selection were further identified with no a priori assumption of abs. for this purpose, two maximum-likelihood  frameworks were carried out as proposed by  <cit> . first, two alternative models comprised in the codeml program included in the paml package version  <dig>  were executed  <cit> . the first one  allows codons to evolve either neutrally  or under purifying selection , while the second one  considers a class of sites under positive selection . these models were compared with a likelihood ratio test  with two degrees of freedom   <cit> . as previously described, each analysis was run twice, with starting ω values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , to ensure convergence  <cit> . the f3 ×  <dig> model of codon frequencies was assumed for all analyses. the amino acids positively selected were identified using the bayes empirical bayes approach , as recommended by yang  <cit> , with the cutoff posterior probability set at 90 %. secondly, five ml methods proposed in the hyphy package were used. for all analyses, the best fitting nucleotide substitution model was assessed with the automatic model selection tool available on the server. a single likelihood ancestor counting  model was used to detect evidence of the non-neutral evolution of the drb gene  <cit> . based on ancestral reconstruction, this model counts dn and ds changes at each codon position in a phylogeny. fixed  and random effects likelihood  models were performed to estimate the ω ratio on a site-by-site basis  <cit> . for the fel model, ω ratios were estimated with an a priori distribution of rates across sites, while this distribution was determined by the present data for the rel model. an internal fel  model was carried out to highlight selection pressure at the population level . finally, a mixed effects model of evolution  was performed to highlight both diversifying and importantly episodic selection at individual sites  <cit> . codon positions were regarded as candidates for positive selection if the following two criteria were met:  p-values <  <dig>  for slac, fel, ifel and meme and  bayes factor >  <dig> for rel. accordingly, only sites identified as being under positive selection by at least two approaches were considered  <cit> . analyses were performed per species for the entire dataset and for each environment subgroup separately.

genetic differentiation and past population dynamics
for both neutral and functional markers, the genetic differentiation  among environment subgroups and collecting sites was calculated through an implementation of analysis of molecular variance  using arlequin  <dig> .

isolation-by-distance  was examined with the web service idbws v. <dig>   by assessing the statistical significance of the correlation in a mantel test with  <dig>  permutations. the quantity f
st/ was used as a genetic distance according to rousset  <cit> . geographic distances between populations were determined from gps coordinates recorded at each collecting site.

to add a measurement of relationships between alleles at the intraspecific level, haplotype networks were constructed for each species using the parsimony statistical algorithm tcs implemented in popart  <dig>   <cit> .

a bayesian skyline plot was used to investigate changes in effective population size  over time with beast  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , using mtdna d-loop data only. markov chain monte carlo samples were based on 2 ×  <dig> generations, logging every  <dig> steps, with the first  <dig> , <dig> generations discarded as the burn-in. the best-fitted model hky + g was used with a relaxed molecular clock. the number of stepwise changes in ne was set at five.

mhc class ii drb phylogeny
phylogenetic relationships and trans-species polymorphism between drb alleles were inferred using a bayesian inference approach implemented in mrbayes  <dig>  <cit> . the hla-drb <dig> sequence  was used as outgroup. the gtr + g + i model was selected as the best-fitted model of nucleotide substitution using jmodeltest  <dig>  <cit>  under corrected akaike information criteria . the program was run 10 ×  <dig> generations, with a sampling frequency of  <dig> and a 25 % burn-in. validation of the inference was assessed based on the standard deviation of split frequencies, less than the expected threshold value of  <dig> .

RESULTS
drb sequence characterization
one hundred and three bats  were tested for the amplification of mhc drb using cdna. pcr product sizes ranged from 357 bp to 600 bp, for both c. perspicillata and d. rotundus and covered all of exon  <dig>  . for m. molossus, we successfully amplified 244 bp, excluding primers, of exon  <dig>  we successfully obtained  <dig> mhc drb-like fragments from  <dig> bats . based on blast searches, sequences showed homologies to only drb loci.

detection of indels
two alleles  presented a 3-bp deletion at position 217– <dig> of the nucleotide alignment . these single-codon indels did not induce a frame-shifting mutation or a stop codon. bats carrying these alleles were heterozygotes and found in eh and ur environments. two other alleles  presented a 6-bp insertion at position 115– <dig> of the alignment. these two-codon indels – one serine  and one asparagine  – did not alter the reading frame. dero-drb* <dig> was carried by four bats, all captured in sa, with one homozygote. dero-drb* <dig> was carried by one heterozygote bat captured in cf. no indel event was detected for m. molossus.fig.  <dig> amino acid sequence variation and overall frequency of mhc class ii dr beta exon  <dig> alleles of c. perspicillata, d. rotundus and m. molossus. drb sequences of homo sapiens , c. perspicillata , n. albiventris  and a. jamaicensis  are given for comparison. antigen-binding sites  of the hla-drb <dig> molecule are shadowed  <cit> . dots mark identity with the top sequence. numbers in italics indicate the amino acid positions within the beta  <dig> domain of the hla-drb <dig> molecule. asterisks indicate the positively selected sites  identified in each species, according to acceptance criteria described in the methods section  <cit> . † indicates pss identified by  <cit> , and ‡ indicates pss identified by  <cit>

discussion
in this study, we explored the genetic variability of the expressed mhc drb genes of three sympatric neotropical bat species, looking for selection signatures within the pbr and investigating the role of the environment and the population structure on mhc diversity.

diversity patterns in the mhc class ii drb gene
in the three species, identified alleles  were unique in amino acid sequences, suggesting a non-redundant nucleotide polymorphism. the number of alleles detected per species and per environment subgroup within each species indicated a relatively high level of mhc drb variation. these results are in agreement with previously reported allelic copy number variation between or within bat species .

this high drb polymorphism was observed in the three species whatever the degree of habitat disturbance . in addition, no loss of polymorphism induced by low host and/or pathogen diversity, expected to occur in disturbed environments  <cit>  was observed. furthermore, mtdna d-loop sequences, considered as neutral, revealed high levels of genetic diversity for c. perspicillata and m. molossus. high levels of neutral diversity have been associated with either multiple geographic origin and/or population admixture  <cit> , suggesting that c. perspicillata and m. molossus populations originated from one of these two phenomena or from both. the high level of drb polymorphism can be related to population history for these two species with the effects of additional selection factors such as pathogen-mediated selection.

a high number of drb homozygotes was also found in m. molossus in all habitats as well as in c. perspicillata but in edge habitats only. for these two species, the presence of a specific allele  ensuring an adequate immunity can be hypothesized  <cit> . considering d. rotundus, a high number of heterozygotes for drb was observed in all habitats. this result suggests a heterozygote advantage related to the forest  environment known to encompass higher species and pathogen richness  <cit> .

the most frequent mhc drb alleles encountered in each bat species  were all identified in forest environments. these alleles are likely ancient and play a significant role in the immune response, conferring a selective advantage to the bats in sympatry in these habitats. indeed, given that forest environments are characterized by a high level of pathogen diversity, these alleles most likely possess enhanced recognition capabilities and might be able to recognize a broader range of pathogens. they thus allow a more efficient immune response in line with the ecological diversity. moreover, the geographical structure highlighted in d. rotundus, using mtdna d-loop results, did not affect the allelic distribution. indeed, most of the alleles identified in d. rotundus were shared between sites, and one allele  was present at all sites. in contrast, no geographical structure was found in c. perspicillata even if the alleles identified in urban and periurban areas were rare and not shared with other groups. these results suggest that environment rather than population structure drives the allelic distribution, corroborating a local adaptation hypothesis. although edge and forest habitats may differ in pathogenic pressures , the results observed for c. perspicillata may be related to the high tolerance of this species to habitat disturbance and to its dominance in bat communities in edge habitats  <cit> , likely allowing continuous exposure to the communities of pathogens of both pristine and disturbed forests, and pathogen transfer between these habitats.

duplication detected in phyllostomidae
gene conversion and recombination events were not detected for any species. the identification of three expressed drb alleles in individuals from c. perspicillata and d. rotundus supported the existence of at least two functional drb loci. however, underestimation of the number of alleles and expressed loci can be suspected, considering the limited number of recombinant clones per primer combinations and the use of cdna only allowing the detection of the most frequently expressed alleles. the occurrence of multiple mhc drb loci varying in the number of loci between individuals and species was reported in neotropical bat species such as c. perspicillata , s. bilineata   <cit> , a. jamaicensis   <cit> , as well as in other animals  <cit> . together with environmental and biological patterns, gene conversion and recombination processes are known to drive the extensive mhc polymorphism  <cit> .

variable gene duplication between closely related taxa and among individuals from the same species is characteristic of mhc genes and plays a critical role in the adaptive evolution of the host  <cit> . gene duplication can occur over different time scales and therefore predates or follows speciation events. furthermore, the absence of recombination between alleles of different species was reported. this result was regarded as evidence of recent duplication events between loci that occurred after speciation  <cit> . our findings support this hypothesis since some recent radiation events occurred in neotropical bat species during the pleistocene era  .

despite the indels detected in some c. perspicillata and d. rotundus sequences, the reading frames remained unaltered, suggesting that these sequences encode functional proteins . nevertheless, the heterozygote-dominant character of individuals with these alleles suggests a turnover of these loci generated by evolutionary processes such as the silencing of duplicate genes by mutation or deletion  <cit> . under the birth-and-death model, genes created by duplication can be maintained for long periods, deleted or transformed as pseudogenes and, therefore, contribute to host fitness and adaptability  <cit> . the phenomenon is especially significant among heterozygote d. rotundus, for which one of the two alleles is among the most widespread in the population studied , and supports a shift towards an allele with better recognition capabilities.

evidence of historical positive selection
higher rates of non-synonymous  vs. synonymous  nucleotide substitutions were observed, especially in sites supposedly involved in antigen-binding. this excess of dn over ds in abs is consistent with balancing selection acting on drb loci, as a sign of historical positive selection in polymorphic mhc genes  <cit> . furthermore, an unexpected excess of dn in putative non-abs for c. perspicillata suggests strong positive selection acting on these sites and highlights species-specific divergence on sites involved in antigen recognition.

a high congruence was observed between species-specific positively selected sites  in the three species and human abs demonstrating the functional homology of these sites. in contrast, pss not identified as human abs might play a role in mhc drb recognition capability or in the molecule stability for the species studied. here, nine of the pss were detected in c. perspicillata, while only one was detected in both d. rotundus and m. molossus. therefore, the observed excess of dn in c. perspicillata was attributed to pss identified as non-abs in humans. this result demonstrates the critical role of positive selection in shaping mhc diversity and corroborates that positive selection is driven by a species-specific immune response. focusing on c. perspicillata, comparisons of pss identified here with those previously described revealed high congruence, even among pss not identified as human abs  <cit> . a similar result was observed between c. perspicillata and a. jamaicensis, two phyllostomidae with the same diet  <cit> . taken together, these findings reveal family and species-specific selection pressures acting on mhc genes. moreover, the high similarity of pss between a. jamaicensis and c. perspicillata highlights that bat species sharing similar feeding strategies might be subjected – independently of their habitats – to similar pathogenic pressures, mainly from their microbiota  <cit> . comparisons between each environment subgroup, for each present case, revealed the existence of private pss depending on the area, suggesting a habitat-specific selection pressure process. indeed, while six private pss were counted in urban and periurban areas for c. perspicillata, only two were detected in edge habitats and one in pristine forest.

phylogeny, trans-species polymorphism and demographic process
two mechanisms are thought to be responsible for the trans-specific similarity of mhc genes: convergent evolution  <cit>  and trans-species polymorphism  <cit> . evidence of trans-species polymorphism in bats was reported in both myotis spp. and noctilio spp.  <cit>  and at the family level between the two phyllostomids a. jamaicensis and c. perspicillata  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses in our study did not reveal any characteristic clustering of mhc alleles depending on the habitat, but rather clades at the family, genus and species levels . these results suggest either similar pathogenic pressures or that these alleles possess a larger antigenic recognition capability that constitutes a major asset to the immune response of these species. intermingled clusterings observed in this survey  are in agreement with trans-species polymorphism reported in bats  <cit> . the observed trans-species polymorphism for myotis spp.  <cit>  was not detected in the present study. the results highlighted clustering between s. bilineata and m. velifer. however, this clustering was no longer observed by analyzing full-length exon  <dig>  observation of trans-species polymorphism within bat families  strengthens the scenario of independent modes of evolution of mhc drb alleles, allowing balancing selection to retain substantial allelic lineages before speciation events  <cit> . extended periods of host–pathogen coevolution is thought to contribute to trans-species polymorphism given that host-sharing pathogens and exposure to similar pathogen pressures are believed to induce similar changes in different host species  <cit> .

although pathogen-driven selection is known to be crucial in mhc diversity  <cit> , demographic processes such as genetic drift, bottlenecks, expansions, fragmentation and geographic isolation have been demonstrated to also participate in the shaping of this extensive polymorphism  <cit> . evolutionary analyses of mhc drb alleles for the three species did not reveal any area-dependent clustering effect. furthermore, analyses of partial sequences of the mtdna d-loop revealed no structuration for c. perspicillata and m. molossus, whereas it was observed for d. rotundus. demographic analysis performed for the three species did not detect any substantial bottleneck or expansion. while the patterns observed for the first two species corroborate the hypothesis of a similarity between the intrinsic genetic diversity of the species and that of mhc, the lack of similarity between these patterns of diversity for d. rotundus contradicts this statement. these results suggest that the signature of an area-limited pathogen-driven selection, supported by the presence of private pss rather than by demographic processes such as distance isolation, is observed in this case.

CONCLUSIONS
this study was the first to investigate mhc drb polymorphism in three sympatric bat species, m. molossus, c. perspicillata and d. rotundus, from the amazonian region. our results revealed a high genetic variability in the mhc drb gene. natural selection, as well as local adaptation driven by different parasite and pathogen exposures across environments, contribute to the maintenance of an extensive mhc polymorphism. the richness of pathogens in the different habitats should be investigated to strengthen our assumptions on potential local adaptation. further studies using finer neutral markers such as microsatellites will be necessary to detect possible confounding effects, such as hidden structuring and demographic history, and thus to better understand the drivers of mhc allelic diversity.
