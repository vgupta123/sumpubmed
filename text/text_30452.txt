BACKGROUND
chromatin immunoprecipitation  is a technique widely used to study interactions of proteins with specific genomic regions  <cit> . several methodologies have been devised for the detection of the genomic fragments generated by a chip experiment . in particular, the use of dna microarray methodology  allows for high-throughput analysis of thousands of genomic sequences simultaneously  <cit> . genome tiling arrays covering entire genomes  <cit>  can be used to map the sites of dna-protein interaction on a genomic scale, although at a high cost.

here, we propose the use of snp microarrays  to evaluate chip products  as an alternative to genome tiling arrays. snp microarrays are designed to genotype thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms  by hybridization of genomic fragments to an array of short nucleotide sequences  <cit> . the evaluation of snp-chip hybridization in binary terms  might be appropriate for chip-on-chip experiments where a large number of dna-protein interaction sites have to be detected and the evaluation of the strength of each interaction is not an issue. the mapping of histone modifications throughout the genome fulfills these requirements. to illustrate the chip on snp-chip methodology, we present here a genome-wide analysis of histone h <dig> hyperacetylation in human myoblasts and myotubes.

histone h <dig> hyperacetylation has been associated with increased gene expression  <cit> , and, although the molecular basis of this effect is under investigation  <cit> , the precise pattern of histone acetylation and its effect on gene expression is not completely understood  <cit> . the assembly of an active transcriptional complex at the promoter is an essential feature of eukaryotic gene expression  <cit> . histone acetylation of the promoter precedes the activation of many genes and is thought to establish a chromatin environment suitable for the assembly of the transcriptional complex  <cit> . the genomic distribution of h <dig> acetylation has been studied for individual genes , across human chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , and at whole genome level in yeast  <cit> , but never for a complete mammalian genome. quantification of the pattern of histone h <dig> hyperacetylation in the human genome will add valuable information about the mechanisms by which this histone modification affects chromatin structure and controls gene expression.

the analysis of our results indicates significant clusters of h <dig> hyperacetylation at a range of  <dig> kilobases in human samples from both myoblasts and myotubes. complementary analysis of gene expression of the same samples indicates that histone h <dig> hyperacetylation is positively associated with gene expression at a range of  from the start of gene transcription; a much greater range than previously reported. these results show that chip on snp-chip can be used to provide biological insight into how histone h <dig> hyperacetylation affects both eukaryotic transcription and chromatin's structural integrity.

RESULTS
we assessed the genomic distribution of hyperacetylated histone h <dig> by chip with an antibody specific to the n-terminal tail of histone h <dig> acetylated at residues lys <dig>  lys <dig>  lys <dig>  and lys <dig>  hybridization of the chip products to the affymetrix  <dig> k snp microarray produced reproducible results for  <dig>  probes  in a sample of human myoblasts, and for  <dig>  probes  in a sample of human myotubes . an overview of the genomic distribution of these results is given in figure  <dig> 

analysis of the hybridization reported by snp-array probes indicates that there is a tendency for probes detecting h <dig> hyperacetylation to cluster in nearby genomic positions . this tendency is significant up to a range of  <dig> kb meaning that histone h <dig> hyperacetylation occurs in clusters that can span  <dig> kb. in contrast, non-hybridized probes do not cluster . it is unlikely that the clustering effect is due to chip'd dna fragments hybridizing to multiple probes in the snp-array, since the dna is digested with xbai, which cuts once every  <dig> kb in the human genome, on average.

to study the relationship between histone h <dig> hyperacetylation and gene expression, we obtained gene expression data from equivalent human myoblast and myotube samples. analysis of mrna cellular transcripts using the affymetrix hgu133a/b chip set produced reproducible results for  <dig>  probesets  in human myoblasts, and for  <dig>  probesets  in human myotubes. an overview of the genomic distribution of these results is given in figure  <dig> 

in contrast to our observation for the snp-array probes, we did not observe correlation between probesets corresponding to transcripts in neighbouring regions of the genome . this is consistent with multiple evidence showing the general lack of gene expression correlation between neighbouring genes in eukaryotic genomes with few exceptions such as the histone genes or hox genes . therefore, the clusters of hyperacetylated h <dig> that were identified cannot be explained by the correlated expression of clusters of genes.

next, we studied how the distribution of hybridization values reporting histone h <dig> hyperacetylation near the start of transcription of genes is modified by the status of expression of the gene. indeed, we observed that histone modification was significantly higher around the start of transcription of expressed genes than non-expressed genes, both in human myoblasts and myotubes, with a somewhat larger effect upstream the transcription start site than downstream . we identified a significant effect at a distance of  <dig> kilobases from the start of transcription. at this range, in myoblasts the ratio of hybridizing to non-hybridizing snp-probes was  <dig> / <dig> =  <dig>  for expressed genes, and of  <dig> / <dig>  =  <dig>  for non-expressed genes . similarly, in myotubes, the ratio of hybridizing to non-hybridizing snp-probes was  <dig> / <dig> =  <dig>  for expressed genes, and of  <dig> / <dig>  =  <dig>  for non-expressed genes . both value distributions are significant at p value <  <dig>  according to a chi-square test. statistically significant, though less marked, differences were observed at distances up to  <dig> kilobases .

imprinted loci should display allele specific distribution of specific chromatin modifications. therefore, we examined all heterozygous loci following determination of genotypes by snp analysis of total dna isolated from myoblasts to identify novel regions displaying reciprocally modified chromatin. of the snps assessed,  <dig>  snps were found to be heterozygous.  <dig> and  <dig> of the heterozygous snps had a relative signal above background in myoblasts and in myotubes, respectively. the contribution of each allele to the overall relative signal was equivalent in the majority of these heterozygote snps. however,  <dig> of the  <dig> and  <dig> of the  <dig> heterozygous snps had signal from only one allele in myoblasts and myotubes, respectively. in most of the  <dig> heterozygous snps with signal both in myoblasts and in myotubes, the relative contribution of each allele was maintained between the myotube and myoblast samples . however, the other  <dig> snps suggested a change . together, these data indicate an unanticipated level of complexity in chromatin structure acetylation present at numerous heterozygous loci.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we have presented the novel use of snp-arrays for identification of dna fragments in a chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment . our application of this methodology to the analysis of histone h <dig> hyperacetylation in human myoblasts and myotubes suggests that this histone modification happens in clusters across large genomic distances .

the study of gene expression in equivalent samples indicates no correlation of gene expression in nearby genes, but that the clusters of hyperacetylated histone h <dig> are associated with expressed genes at ranges of up to  <dig> kilobases. these results together suggest that histone h <dig> hyperacetylation is a relatively imprecise mechanism that acts over genomic regions sometimes spanning multiple genes, that are then expressed or not according to the more precise activity of the transcription factor machinery. it has been suggested that such a mechanism could facilitate rapid gene transcription in response to external stimuli  <cit> .

we have demonstrated that chip on snp-chip can be used to characterize genomic sites of dna-protein interaction. chip on snp-chip makes it feasible to establish general rules of association between proteins and dna but does not provide precise information regarding the strength of individual interaction sites because of the intrinsic noise level of the snp-array used in this way. we recommend this methodology for experiments like the one presented in this manuscript, where the aim is to identify a large number of genomic sites of protein-dna interaction. in particular, this methodology is ideally suited to the study of histone modifications. in addition, the use of snp chips provides information about the allelic distribution of the chromatin modifications under study. this could be of value if the researcher is studying imprinting or alternatively the effect genetic variants on the binding of a protein to dna. our analysis of heterozygous loci suggest an unanticipated level of complexity in chromatin acetylation between alleles. since we performed the analyses presented in this manuscript, newer snp arrays with higher resolution have been produced. for example, the new genome-wide human snp array  <dig>   features more than  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  and more than  <dig>  probes for the detection of copy number variation. without question, the new generation snp arrays allow thorough coverage of the genome for efficient analysis of chip products.
