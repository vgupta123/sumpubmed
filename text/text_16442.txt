BACKGROUND
salmonella species are some of the most important food-borne pathogens in the world. members of the genus salmonella are gram-negative, facultative anaerobic rods which are composed of more than  <dig> serotypes  <cit> . salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium  is an important causative agent for gastroenteritis. for most bacteria, adhesion to host epithelial cells is the first step in establishing an infection. adhesion proteins or hair-like appendages called fimbriae on the outer membranes of bacteria have been implicated in adherence  <cit> . whole-genome sequencing identified  <dig> separate fimbrial gene clusters that may have the potential to encode fimbria-associated proteins in s. typhimurium  <cit> . among these, type- <dig> fimbriae are the most commonly found type in s. typhimurium, as in other members of the family enterobacteriaceae <cit> . in addition to adherence, type  <dig> fimbriae also contribute to virulence and biofilm formation  <cit> .

phenotypic expression of type  <dig> fimbriae in s. typhimurium involves the interaction and cooperation of genes in the fim gene cluster. briefly, fima, fimi, fimf, and fimh are structural proteins that are incorporated to assemble a fimbrial shaft structure, while fimc and fimd proteins located in the periplasmic space and on the outer membrane respectively, function to transport and anchor the fimbrial proteins. fimz, fimy, fimw, and an arginine transfer rna fimu, regulate fimbrial production by a complicated network  <cit> . studies also demonstrated that a global regulator, leucine-responsive regulatory protein , and other genes outside the fim gene cluster also take part in the regulatory expression of type- <dig> fimbriae  <cit> .

bis--cyclic dimeric gmp  is a universal second messenger that controls cell surface-associated characters in bacteria  <cit> . recent studies revealed the importance of c-di-gmp in regulating many physiological process such as adhesion, biofilm formation, exopolysaccharide synthesis, virulence, and motility  <cit> . the cellular c-di-gmp concentration is regulated by diguanylate cyclase  and phosphodiesterase . dgc catalyzes the formation of c-di-gmp through a linear intermediate, pppgpg, while pde degrades it into guanosine monophosphate . the most prominent conserved protein domains in the pde are eal and hd-gyp  <cit> . an open reading frame named stm <dig>  located between fimy and fimw, has not previously been investigated to determine its involvement in type- <dig> fimbrial regulation in s. typhimurium . the amino acid sequence of the stm <dig> protein could encode a putative pde. multiple alignments of the eal domain of stm <dig> with other known pde enzymes demonstrated the preservation of several regions throughout the domain sequence >. since stm  <dig> influences curli fimbrial expression in s. typhimurium, and mrkj controls type  <dig> fimbriae production and biofilm formation in klebsiella pneumoniae <cit> , we decided to investigate whether stm <dig> encodes a functional pde that plays a role in type  <dig> fimbrial expression.

in the present study, a stm <dig> mutant was constructed by allelic exchange. phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of this mutant were analyzed. purified stm <dig> protein was tested for its putative function as a pde in vitro. a possible role of stm <dig> in type  <dig> fimbrial regulation in s. typhimurium is discussed.

RESULTS
type  <dig> fimbrial expression by the s. typhimurium stm <dig> mutant strain
the bacterial strains and plasmids used were described in table  <dig>  while the primers used was indicated in table  <dig>  the s. typhimurium stm <dig> knockout mutant strain was constructed by a one-step gene inactivation method  <cit> . primers stm0551-f and stm0551-r external to stm <dig> amplified a  <dig> -kb dna fragment from s. typhimurium lb <dig> genomic dna, while the same primer set generated a  <dig> -kb dna fragment from genomic dna of the s. typhimurium stm <dig> mutant strain, indicating a kanamycin cassette inserted into the stm <dig> gene. this dna fragment was also sequenced to determine its identity. the confirmed stm <dig> mutant strain was then designated s. typhimurium Δstm <dig>  s. typhimurium lb <dig> mediated yeast agglutination and guinea pig erythrocyte when cultured in static lb broth, whereas agglutination was not detected when cells were collected from lb agar . in contrast, the s. typhimurium Δstm <dig> strain mediated agglutination when grown on lb agar. nonetheless the degree of agglutination was not as strong as the same strain grown in static lb broth. transformation of the pstm <dig> plasmid that contains the coding sequence of stm <dig> conferred on s. typhimurium Δstm <dig> strain the ability to inhibit type  <dig> fimbrial expression in both culture conditions, while the s. typhimurium Δstm <dig> strain carrying a plasmid that possessed a stm <dig> coding sequence with the glutamic acid  at position  <dig> replaced with an alanine , or a pacyc <dig> cloning vector exhibited the same phenotype as the s. typhimurium Δstm <dig> strain. the figure  <dig> demonstrated the yeast agglutination tests performed on glass slides.

aampr ampicillin resistant; cmr chloramphenicol resistant; kanr kanamycin resistant; tetr tetracycline resistant

a phenotypic expression of type- <dig> fimbriae was determined using a mannose-sensitive yeast agglutination test and guinea pig erythrocyte hemagglutination test

electron microscopy
s. typhimurium lb <dig> prepared in static lb broth culture demonstrated fimbrial appendages on the outermembrane of the cell . on the contrary, s. typhimurium lb <dig> grown on agar medium did not produce type <dig> fimbriae . the s. typhimurium Δstm <dig> strain prepared from static broth medium  or agar  produced fimbrial structures.

quantitative rt-pcr analysis
total rna from lb <dig>  Δstm <dig>  Δstm <dig> , and Δstm <dig>  strains were prepared and analyzed for the fimbrial subunit gene, fima, and the regulatory genes, fimz, fimy, and fimw, by quantitative rt-pcr. 16 s ribosomal  rna expression was used as a control. individual gene expression profiles were first normalized against the 16 s rrna gene and then compared to the expression level of fima, fimz, fimy, and fimw obtained from agar. as for the parental lb <dig> strain, fima expression obtained from static lb broth was about 150-fold higher than the value obtained from lb agar. the fima expression of the Δstm <dig> strain grown on agar was significantly higher than that of lb <dig> grown on agar. transformation of Δstm <dig> with a plasmid possessing the stm <dig> coding sequence repressed fima expression whether this strain was cultured on agar or in static broth, whereas transformation of the same bacterial strain with the plasmid cloning vector pacyc <dig> de-repressed fima expression in both culture conditions . the fimz expression levels from different strains demonstrated a similar profile to that observed for fima. the parental lb <dig> strain exhibited significant elevated level of fimz when grown in broth than on agar. the fimz expression of Δstm <dig> was higher than that of the parental strain grown on agar. transforming Δstm <dig> with pstm <dig> repressed fimz expression on both culture conditions, while transforming Δstm <dig> with pacyc <dig> cloning vector de-repressed fimz expression, leading to comparable level of expression as seen in the Δstm <dig> strain . however, the expression levels of fimy were not significantly different between strains under both growth conditions . Δstm <dig> had higher fimw expression than Δstm <dig> did when both strains were culture on agar medium .

pde activity
since the predicted amino acid sequence of stm <dig> suggested that it was related to a family of proteins that exhibit pde activity, we determined whether stm <dig> possessed pde activity. the in vitro pde activity of the purified stm0551-his fusion protein was determined using the specific substrate, bis . the purified fimy-his fusion protein was used as a control since fimy amino acids exhibited no domain related to pde activity. stm <dig> possesses “evl” conserved residues that may form the putative active site that varies from the consensus “eal” sequence. we constructed a substitution mutation in which the glutamic acid  at position  <dig> was replaced by alanine  in the stm <dig> allele. a fusion protein of this construct was prepared with the same procedure described for stm <dig> and fimy and was designed as stm0551e49a-his. the reactions that contained stm <dig> exhibited a statistically significant  <dig> -fold increase in the release of p-nitrophenol compared to that containing fimy and stm0551e49a  . this result suggests that stm <dig> could function as a pde.

discussion
the regulatory pathway of type  <dig> fimbriae in s. typhimurium involves several genes including the fim gene cluster and other genes such as lrp <cit> . the salmonella pathogenicity island  <dig>  and flagellar systems also crosstalk with type  <dig> fimbriae  <cit> . several studies have indicated that the mechanism controlling the intracellular c-di-gmp concentration plays a critical role in regulating fimbrial production. for example, mrkj, a pde, regulates type- <dig> fimbrial production in klebsiella pneumoniae <cit> . deletion of mrkj resulted in an increase in type- <dig> fimbrial production  <cit> . in escherichia coli s fimbriae are regulated by a pde, sfay  <cit> . production of cupa fimbriae of pseudomonas aeruginosa is controlled by both the ggdef domain in protein, pa <dig>  and pvrr that contains an eal domain  <cit> . the fimk of klebsiella pneumoniae contains the eal domain and deletion of fimk conferred hyperpiliation of type  <dig> fimbriae in this bacterium  <cit> . our present finding may add one more example to this fimbrial regulation/c-di-gmp concentration circuit.

the stm <dig> gene of s. typhimurium is located within the fim gene cluster but has not previously been investigated. the predicted amino acids of stm <dig> showed similarity to those of proteins with pde activity, so it was interesting to further dissect the function of stm <dig> in terms of type  <dig> fimbrial regulation. the parental strain s. typhimurium lb <dig>  is an lt <dig> derivative and displays a variable fimbrial phase  <cit> . a static broth culture favors s. typhimurium to produce type  <dig> fimbriae, while non-fimbriae phase bacteria were obtained by growth on solid agar medium  <cit> . a stm <dig> knockout mutant strain constructed in the present study enabled it to produce type  <dig> fimbriae on the solid lb agar medium. this phenotype was correlated with the rt-pcr result that the mrna expression of the major fimbrial subunit, fima, was enhanced on solid-agar culture medium. these suggested that stm <dig> plays a repressive role in type  <dig> fimbrial regulation perhaps in a similar manner to the role played by fimw in the fim regulatory circuit  <cit> . the expression of fima of the transformant Δstm <dig>  grown on agar decreased to the same level as that of the parental lb <dig> strain grown in the same conditions. however, this transformant did not exhibit visible yeast agglutination and guinea pig erythrocyte hemagglutination when grown in static broth, nor did this strain exhibit fima expression, which was unexpected. one of the reasons could have been the relatively high level of stm <dig> production due to presence of the multiple copies of the pstm <dig> recombinant plasmid in these cells. an excessive stm <dig> level in s. typhimurium could presumably cause a dramatically decreased concentration of c-di-gmp locally, and subsequently interfere with fima expression. however, the mechanism by which stm <dig> interacts with fima gene expression remains unclear. one possibility is that the stm <dig> product maintained the local concentration of c-di-gmp at a level such that only a certain amount of c-di-gmp was bound by a hypothetical pilz domain containing protein. this low concentration of c-di-gmp-bound, pilz domain-containing protein was not able to activate fima gene expression. disruption of stm <dig> increased the local c-di-gmp concentration and consequently also increased the “functional” pilz domain-containing protein to enhance fima expression. the fimy protein of s. typhimurium could possibly function as such a pilz domain-containing protein since recently we found that the amino acid sequence of fimy demonstrated relatedness to those of mrkh of k. pneumoniae and ycgr of the e. coli k- <dig> strain . both mrkh and ycgr were shown to be transcriptional activators with c-di-gmp-binding pilz domains  <cit> . our hypothesis about the role fimy correlates with the finding that stm <dig> did not affect fimy at the transcriptional level . more detailed study of fimy is necessary to define its role in a possible c-di-gmp regulatory network. both fimy and fimz are required to activate fima expression in s. typhimurium  <cit> . fimz is a dna binding protein that binds the fima promoter and activate its expression  <cit> . our qrt-pcr results demonstrated very similar profiles for both fima and fimz expression . according to the results reported by saini et al., fimy and fimz independently activate the fima gene expression, in addition, fimy and fimz also activated each other’s expression  <cit> . inactivation of stm <dig> could possibly increase the local concentration of c-di-gmp, which results more c-di-gmp bound fimy  available to activate fimz and fima, and eventually amplifies the fima expression. fimw is a repressor for fima in s. typhimurium. fimw may achieve this repressive role by repressing fimy transcription or by protein-protein interaction with fimz  <cit> . in the present study, little information was obtained regarding how stm <dig> may interact with fimw.

the purified stm <dig> fusion protein possessed the ability to cleave the pde-specific substrate, bis , in vitro, thus confirming the putative phosphodiesterase function assigned to it in the current databank. the construct stm0551e49a-his contained a point mutation in which the conserved glutamic acid residue at position  <dig> within the putative active site was replaced with an alanine residue; the stm0551e49a mutant protein was unable to cleave bis . in accordance with this result, when the stm0551e49a-containg construct cloned into a pacyc <dig> vector  was transformed into Δstm <dig>  the resulting transformant exhibited the same phenotype as that of Δstm <dig> or Δstm <dig> possessing pacyc <dig> cloning vector . this further suggested that the glutamic acid at position  <dig> of stm <dig> did play a critical role for phosphodiesterase activity. therefore, the in vivo agglutination phenotype results correlated with the in vitro phosphodiesterase activity result. in addition, the purified fimy protein, a positive regulator of type  <dig> fimbriae, also did not demonstrate such activity. our results indicated that stm <dig> has pde activity in vitro. currently, we can only say that stm <dig> takes part in the complicated type  <dig> fimbrial regulatory network and play a repressive role. we have no direct evidence about whether stm <dig> actually modulates the concentration of the c-di-gmp pool in s. typhimurium to achieve its impact on fim gene regulation. although the determination of the intracellular concentration of c-di-gmp of Δstm <dig> mutants warrants further investigation, this may be prove to be difficult because the c-di-gmp concentration fluctuates locally, due to the spatial compartmentalization of proteins  <cit> . one example of this phenomenon is that the majority of the c-di-gmp in acetobacter xylinum is bound by a membrane protein and is released only in response to certain signals  <cit> ; therefore we need to take into consideration that the actual and measured concentrations of c-di-gmp might be different.

besides fimbrial production, it is interesting to investigate whether stm <dig> can influence other phenotypes of s. typhimurium. we tested the ability of bacteria to form biofilm, swimming and swarming motility, and the ability to bind congo red  in the lb <dig> and Δstm0551strains, but both strains exhibited the same phenotype  <cit>  . in summary, our study has suggested for the first time that stm <dig> allele which encodes a pde, play a regulatory role in the production of type  <dig> fimbriae in s. typhimurium.

CONCLUSIONS
the c-di-gmp pathway is used by most bacteria  to regulate numerous biological processes  <cit> . several lines of evidence have indicated the concentration of c-di-gmp, balanced by diguanylate cyclase  and phosphodiesterase , account for the fimbrial regulatory network in some microorganisms. in s. typhimurium, it has been demonstrated that production of curli fimbriae was inhibited by a pde stm <dig> <cit> . however, no other type of fimbrial expression in this microorganism has thus far been shown to be controlled by dgc or pde. the present study revealed that a previously uncharacterized stm <dig> gene, which could encode a pde, contributes to the down-regulation of type  <dig> fimbrial expression in s. typhimurium. our finding may provide valuable information that may help to further elucidate the complicated type  <dig> fimbrial regulatory circuit in this pathogen.
