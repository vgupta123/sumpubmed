BACKGROUND
nasopharyngeal carcinoma  is a common malignant cancer in southern china  <cit> . epidemiological investigations have revealed that the incidence of npc has remained high in endemic regions, particularly in southern china with an incidence of 30– <dig> per  <dig>  people per year  <cit> . npc has the feature of high invasion and metastasis, and cervical lymphadenopathy is often the only clinical manifestation at initial diagnosis of npc patients  <cit> . therapeutic failure in advanced npc has resulted from both high rates of local recurrence and distant metastasis.

in chinese populations in high-incidence regions, the relative risk of npc is related to their eating habits of the region, particularly with dietary intake of salt-preserved fish  <cit> . the process of salt preservation is inefficient and foods can become partially putrefied , consequently, these foods accumulate significant levels of nitrosamines  <cit> , which are known carcinogens  <cit> . nn ′-dinitrosopiperazine  is a predominant volatile nitrosamine in salted fish  <cit> . the carcinogenic potential of dnp in salt-preserved fish is supported by experiments in rats, which develop malignant nasal and npc  <cit> . furthermore, dnp can induce malignant transformation of human embryonic nasopharyngeal epithelial cells  <cit> . our previous works have shown that dnp induces rat npc and shows organ specificity for nasopharyngeal epithelium, and found that dnp triggers over-expression of hot shock protein  <dig> and mucin 5b  <cit> . additionally, dnp induces ezrin phosphorylation at thr <dig> through activating rho kinase and protein kinase c, and increases motility and invasion of npc cells  <cit> . in the present study, to fully understand the mechanism of dnp-mediated npc invasion and metastasis, we used a stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture  to further analyze the proteomic changes caused by dnp. we found that  <dig> proteins were regulated by dnp, most of which were not previously reported to be involved in npc metastasis. analysis of this vast information provides us with better understanding of the complex regulatory mechanism of npc high metastasis. using bioinformatics analysis, we detected many novel signaling components in dnp-regulated signaling pathways.

methods
cell culture and stable isotope labeling
npc cell line 6-10b was derived from the cell line sune- <dig>  and has a low metastatic ability  <cit> . thus, 6-10b cells were used in the present study to investigate dnp-mediated npc metastasis. dnp was a carcinogens specially for npc and its chemical structure is shown in figure 2a. additionally, heavy lysine and arginine  were purchased from sigma-aldrich. 6-10b cells were grown in dmem containing 2h4-l-lysine and 13c6 15n4-l-arginine  or conventional l-lysine and l-arginine  supplemented with dialyzed fetal bovine serum. after six cell doublings, we assessed the labeled amino acids in cells, and then identified whether cells were completely incorporated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using an autoflex maldi-tof-ms instrument . mass spectra were searched against a database of human proteins and subsequently quantified using mascot server .


3--5--2- -2h-tetrazolium assay
to determine the non-cytotoxic concentration of dnp, 3--5-- 2- -2h-tetrazolium  assay was performed to determine the viability of “heavy” labeled 6-10b cells. briefly, “heavy” labeled 6-10b cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5 ×  <dig> cells / well and treated with dnp at a concentration between  <dig> and  <dig> μm at 37°c for  <dig> h. thereafter,  <dig> μl mtt  was added per well for  <dig> h. the viable cell number per dish is directly proportional to formazan production, which can be measured spectrophotometrically at  <dig> nm following solubilization with isopropanol.

lactate dehydrogenase assay
to further evaluate the non-cytotoxic concentration of dnp in “heavy” labeled 6-10b cells, lactate dehydrogenase  activity in cell culture media was detected after dnp treatment. briefly, “heavy” labeled 6-10b cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/well and treated with dnp at a concentration between  <dig> and  <dig> μm at 37°c for  <dig> h. after the exposure period, media were collected for ldh activity measurement using the ldh assay kit .

dnp treatment and protein preparation
dnp crystals were dissolved in dmso. appropriate amounts of the dnp stock solution were added into the culture medium to achieve the indicated concentrations  and then incubated with cells for the indicated time periods. at approximately 60% confluence, the “heavy” labeled 6-10b cells were treated with  <dig> μm dnp for  <dig> h according to mtt assay data, while the “light” labeled 6-10b cells were treated with only  <dig> % dmso, served as the control. the treated cells were then harvested and suspended with lysis buffer. lysate was centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm at 4°c for  <dig> min. supernatant fractions were collected and protein concentrations were determined using bca assay kit .

cell invasion and motility assay
cell invasion and motility were assayed according to methods described previously with minor modifications  <cit> . for the invasion assay, “heavy” labeled 6-10b cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of dnp for the indicated times. the treated cells were seeded into boyden chamber with matrigel  at the upper part at a density of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/well in  <dig> μl serum-free medium and incubated for  <dig> h at 37°c. the bottom chamber also contained standard medium with 20% fetal bovine serum. the cells invaded to the lower surface of chamber membrane were fixed with methanol and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the invaded cell numbers were counted under a light microscope. the motility assay was performed as described in the invasion assay without matrigel coating.

evaluation of the effect of dnp on npc metastasis in nude mice
nude mice experiments were performed as previously described  <cit> . twenty babl/c nude mice  were purchased from the animal center of central south university. all animal studies were conducted according to the standards established by the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory by animals of central south university. additionally, the present study protocols were approved by the ethical committee at central south university. briefly, 100-μl aliquots of 6-10b cell suspensions  were mixed with matrigel and injected respectively into the tail veins of the  <dig> nude mice. they were then randomly divided into two groups, dnp-treated and control groups, containing  <dig> mice per group. the dnp-treated group was abdominally injected with dnp at a dose of  <dig> mg/kg  twice a week for  <dig> days using a 1-ml sterile syringe. the control group was treated with  <dig> % dmso. after dnp treatment, the metastasis of 6-10b cells to the lung, liver, and lymph nodes was observed. their metastatic abilities were evaluated by counting tumor metastatic foci on day  <dig> after the injection.

gel electrophoresis and in-gel trypsin digestion
prior to gel electrophoresis, equal amounts of dnp-treated and untreated cell proteins were mixed, separated using 10% sds-page , and stained silver solution to visualize the gel bands. the entire protein gel lanes were horizontally excised and cut into  <dig> slices each, and then destained, reduced, alkylated and digested with gold-trypsin at 37°c overnight as described previously  <cit> . the resulting tryptic peptides were extracted by 90% acetonitrile  and  <dig> % trifluoroacetic acid , lyophilized in a speedvac, and dissolved in 1% formic acid and 2% acetonitrile before liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  analysis.

lc-ms/ms analysis
the peptide mixtures were separated using finnigan surveyor high-performance liquid chromatography system  on a c <dig> reverse phase column, which was coupled online to a linear ion trap/orbitrap  mass spectrometer . briefly, the peptide mixtures were first loaded onto a c18-reversed phase column , and then separated at a maximal flow rate of  <dig> nl/min controlled by intelliflow technology. the peptide mixtures were separated using the following parameters: 1) mobile phase a:  <dig> % formic acid, 2% the acetonitrile, dissolved in water; 2) mobile phase b:  <dig> % formic acid, dissolved in acetonitrile; 3) flow rate: 300nl/min; 4) gradient: b-phase increased from 5% to 35%, 120min. next, the eluate was online analyzed online in ltq-orbitrap mass spectrometer operated in a data-dependent mode, the temperature of the heated capillary was set to 200°c, and the spray voltage was set to  <dig>  kv. full-scan ms survey spectra  in the profile mode were acquired in orbitrap with a resolution of  <dig>  at m/z  <dig> after the accumulation of  <dig> , <dig> ions, and followed by five ms/ms scans in ltq with the following dynamic exclusion settings: a repeat count of  <dig>  a repeat duration of  <dig> s, and an exclusion duration of  <dig> s. the lock mass option was enabled for survey scans to improve mass accuracy  <cit> . the data were acquired using xcalibur .

protein identification, quantification and bioinformatics analysis
protein identification and quantification were performed as previously described with minor modifications  <cit> . briefly, the mass spectrometric raw data were analyzed using maxquant  <dig> . <dig>  software and the derived peak lists were searched using the mascot search engine  against a concatenated real and false international protein index human protein database . mascot search results were further processed by maxquant  <dig> . <dig>  at the false discovery rate of 1% at both the protein, peptide, and site levels. the normalized heavy versus light  ratios, significance, and variability  were automatically produced by maxquant  <dig> . <dig>  software. the final reported protein ratio represents a normalized ratio of h/l silac obtained in all technological repeats where the same protein was identified. international protein index numbers of all significantly regulated proteins and some unaltered proteins were imported into the ingenuity pathway analysis software tool  for bioinformatics analysis based on published reports and databases such as gene ontology, uniport, and trembl.

western blotting analysis
western blotting was used to validate the expression levels of eight dysregulated proteins in dnp-treated and untreated 6-10b cells as described above. 6-10b cells were treated with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> μm for dose-course and treated with  <dig> μm for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> h for time-course. after treatment, supernatants were centrifuged at  <dig> × g for  <dig> min and  <dig> × g for  <dig> min to remove dead cells and cell fragments, and proteins were concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration using microcon ym- <dig> centrifugal filters . the treated cells were disrupted with  <dig>  ml lysis buffer . cell lysates were then subjected to centrifugation of  <dig> × g for  <dig> min at 4°c. equal protein amounts of cell lysates and culture supernatants were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes . the membranes were subsequently incubated with 5% non-fat milk in tris-buffered saline containing  <dig> % tween- <dig> for  <dig> h to block non-specific binding and then overnight with antibodies against aldo-keto reductase  1b <dig>  s100p, cathepsin b, cathepsin d, ferritin, α-e-catenin , or clusterin, agr <dig>  and gapdh , then incubated with the secondary antibody for  <dig> h at room temperature. the band signal was developed using 4-chloro −1-napthol/ <dig> -o-diaminobenzidine, and relative photographic density was quantitated using a gel documentation and analysis system .

gene transfect and wound-healing assays
wound-healing assay was performed as previously described with minor modifications  <cit> . 6-10b cells  were seeded in 10-mm plates at 37°c for  <dig> h, and transiently transfected with si-agr <dig> or si-mock   <cit>  using lipofectamine  <dig> reagent  following the manufacturer’s suggested protocol, and then confluent monolayer of the transfected cell was wounded using a plastic tip. cells were treated with dnp at  <dig> μm, and then photographed after  <dig> h. the cells moving cross the boundaries lines were counted. the transfect cell samples were harvested, and total proteins were extracted. these protein samples were subjected to western blotting analysis.

RESULTS
in this study, quantitative proteomics with silac were used to identify the different protein of 6-10b cells with or without dnp treatment. as the first step 6-10b cells were labeled with amino acid, and then we assessed the incorporation efficiency of 2h4-l-lysine and 13c6 15n4-l-arginine in 6-10b cells for full incorporation in all proteins after six cell doublings. three peptides, vevtefedik , ghytegaelvdsvldvvr  and lrqpffqk  were separated by  <dig> da,  <dig> da, and  <dig> da corresponding to the mass difference between the above light and heavy isotopes. the entire signal corresponded to the heavy peptide, indicating that incorporation of 2h4-l-lysine or 13c6 15n4-l-arginine was complete. to illustrate the quality of the protein identifications reported, we present ms and ms/ms spectra of clusterin and akr1b <dig> from the data obtained from the ltq-orbitrap mass spectrometer .

dnp is a carcinogenic n-nitroso compound, and its chemical structure is shown in figure 2a. although it is known that the non-cytotoxic concentration of dnp to 6-10b cells is 0– <dig> μm, even up to  <dig> μm  <cit> , we determined the non-cytotoxic concentration of dnp in stable isotope-labeled 6-10b cells, cell viability was not significantly altered at 0– <dig> μm dnp compared with control cells . to further confirm that 0– <dig> μm dnp was non-cytotoxic, ldh activity in the cell culture media was detected after dnp treatment. the data revealed that ldh activity was not significantly altered by treatment with dnp concentrations between  <dig> and  <dig> μm . thus, in all subsequent experiments, the concentration of  <dig> μm dnp was used.


although previous work has shown that dnp is involved in npc metastasis, we first confirmed here that dnp mediated npc metastasis. a matrigel-coated boyden chamber was used to measure invasion. 6-10b cells were treated with dnp at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> μm for  <dig> h and then seeded into the boyden chamber. the cells that invaded the lower chamber were counted. the invaded cells increased dose-dependently after dnp treatment . compared with the control, the increase was  <dig> -fold with  <dig> μm dnp . for detecting 6-10b cell motility with dnp treatment, the treated cells were seeded into a boyden chamber uncoated with matrigel, and motile cells were counted. a similar effect was observed for the motility of dnp-treated cells . the cell motility increased by  <dig> -fold after treatment with  <dig> μm dnp . to further confirm dnp –involved metastasis in vivo, the treated 6-10b cells were mixed with matrigel, and then were injected into the tail veins of babl/c mice. tumor metastatic nodes of 6-10b cells in the lungs, livers and lymph nodes were detected. metastatic foci in mice lungs were significantly observed in nude the mice with dnp treatment , and pathologically confirmed under microscope . these data indicated that dnp mediates npc metastasis in vitro and in vivo.


to fully investigate the mechanism of dnp-mediated npc metastasis, silac coupled with lc-ms/ms was used to identify and quantify the proteomic differences. a total  <dig> proteins were detected, and  <dig>  proteins could be quantified. of these  <dig> protein,  <dig> were calculated to be highly up-regulated, and  <dig> were significantly down-regulated at a ratio h/l > <dig>  or ratio h/l < <dig>  and p <  <dig>  . to gain functional insight into the cellular proteome, the  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated proteins were respectively assigned to different molecular functional classes and subcellular annotations according to the underlying biological evidence from the gene ontology database . because some proteins generally have more than one component annotation or function annotation, the sum of each category may be higher than 100%. the  <dig> most abundant terms are shown in figure 4b, c, with additional data shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  mitochondrion proteins and proteins related to junctional mechanisms were highlighted in up-regulated and down-regulated proteins individually , suggesting that further exploration at subcellular levels is necessary. functional analysis of these differential proteins showed that dnp-treated high metastatic 6-10b cells demonstrated significant changes in oxidoreductase activity, cofactor binding, and cytoskeletal protein binding .


proteins that changed significantly in dnp-treated cells were mapped to  <dig> specific functional networks with each network containing  <dig> or more “focus” members . the four networks of interest correspond to the following:  cancer, renal and urological disease, cell death ;  cancer, reproductive system disease, cell death ;  cellular movement, lipid metabolism, molecular transport , and  protein synthesis, cell death, cellular growth and proliferation . proteins that are present in these pathways and that were identified in our analysis as up-regulated are depicted in red, and proteins that were identified as down-regulated are shown in green. proteins known to be in the network but that were not identified in our study are depicted in white. the shade of the color indicates the magnitude of the change in protein expression level.


to confirm the silac results, eight proteins with different fold changes, akr1b <dig>  clusterin, cathepsin b, cathepsin d, ferritin, α-e-catenin, agr <dig>  and s100p were chosen to validate silac results. western blotting results showed that the ratios of eight representative proteins between treated and untreated cells showed either close-degrees or similar fold changes consistent with those obtained from silac . quantification results by silac of the eight proteins are shown in additional file 3: table s <dig>  some of them are secretory proteins, to determine whether dnp also induces these secretory proteins, akr1b <dig>  cathepsin b and clusterin in the culture supernatants of dnp treated 6-10b cells were detected. the results showed that akr1b <dig>  cathepsin b and clusterin dramatically increased in the culture supernatants after dnp treatment . these findings imply that dnp may induce 6-10b cells to secrete akr1b <dig>  cathepsin b and clusterin.


to further confirm whether the different proteins involve dnp-mediated npc metastasis, we chose high-expressed protein agr <dig> as target. dnp induced agr <dig> expression at dose- and time- course . as a metastasis-associated protein, agr <dig> may play an important role in dnp-mediated metastasis. the next step is to observe dnp-mediated metastasis when agr <dig> blocked. we used si-agr <dig> to knockdown agr <dig> , and then used wound-healing assays to detect the cell motility of 6-10b-siagr <dig> with dnp treatment. following si-agr <dig> transfect, dnp-mediated motility decreased, and consequently the cells were unable to migrate into the wound . hence, we concluded that agr <dig> plays an important role in dnp-mediated metastasis.


CONCLUSIONS
in clinic, npc has the features of high invasion and metastasis, but its mechanism has been unclear. as one of three carcinogen factors for npc, the epstein–barr virus  has been proven to be involved in npc metastasis through latent membrane protein 2a inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition , however latent membrane protein is positive at only a  <dig> % rate  <cit> . recently, another important carcinogen factor, dnp was also found to be involved in npc metastasis  <cit> . in the present study, using silac and a systematic data analysis method, we obtained unbiased interpretation of npc cell metastasis induced by dnp. approximately  <dig> proteins were quantified and  <dig> of these proteins showed apparent alterations in expression levels after dnp treatment, involving the regulation of biosynthesis and energy metabolism, as well as cell adhesion or invasion. we speculated that biosynthesis, energy metabolism and invasion are associated with npc metastasis mediated by dnp. based on subcellular and biological function analysis, many differential proteins in the present study were located in mitochondrion, such as mitochondrial membrane part, and mitochondrial respiratory chain. additionally, tumor cells with mitochondria damage or dysfunction were reported to enhance anti-apoptosis ability and invasion  <cit> . this suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction may be linked to metastasis of dnp-treated 6-10b cells.

in the differential proteins mediated by dnp, oxidoreductase activity and oxidoreductase activity acting on nadh or nadph, the ch-ch group of donors, and the ch-ch group of donors, nad or nadp as the acceptor related to proteins accounted for a large proportion. peroxiredoxins  <dig>  nadh-dehydrogenase ubiquinone iron-sulfur protein  <dig> , nadh-dehydrogenase ubiquinone  <dig> beta subcomplex subunit  <dig> , pirin, ferritin heavy chain, and akr <dig> were significantly up-regulated in the high metastatic 6-10b cells with dnp treatment. oxidative stress have been shown to play important roles in tumorigenesis and progression of tumors  <cit> , in which there is aberrant or improper regulation of the redox status. the balance of redox state affects many physiological and pathophysiological processes of cells, its mechanisms include gene transcription, cell signal transduction, activity of enzymes and biological macromolecules, cell proliferation, adhesion, and apoptosis. these findings suggest that the significant change of oxidoreductase activity in high metastatic 6-10b cells with dnp treatment is correlated with the status of oxidative stress and imbalance of the redox state.

cytoskeleton has been identified as a major target for destruction during apoptosis and is important under pathological conditions such as cancers  <cit> . the differential proteins were distributed in the cytoskeleton, including n-myc downstream-regulated gene  <dig> protein, paxillin, and syntenin- <dig>  conversely, some proteins associated with the cytoskeleton were up-regulated, such as catenin alpha- <dig>  radixin, macrophage-capping protein, integrin beta- <dig>  tubulin-specific chaperone d, tubulin beta 2c , tubulin beta 2a, and tubulin  <dig> beta. and subcellular localization of these differential proteins is related to junctional mechanisms. based on these data, we speculate that in high metastatic 6-10b cells with dnp treatment, dynamic modifications and remodeling in the cytoskeleton exist, and the dynamic alteration affects endocytosis, cell shape, cell motility, cell adhesion and invasion.

additionally, some important proteins directly related to metastasis were discovered in our study, such as, annexin a <dig>  s100p, s100a <dig>  hot shock protein 90b <dig>  ferritin heavy chain, tubb2a, and anterior gradient- <dig> . cathepsin b, akr1b <dig> and custerin were not only up-regulated in 6-10b cells with dnp treatment, but also in the cell culture supernatant. cathepsins, initially described as intracellular peptide hydrolases, play a role in invasion and metastasis of cancer  <cit> . in the present study, cathepsins b and d were respectively up-regulated  <dig> -fold  and  <dig> -fold , respectively. cathepsin b is a key enzyme in invasion and metastasis of malignant tumors. it is up-regulated in laryngeal cancer  <cit> , cervical cancer  <cit> , and bladder cancer  <cit> , and its expression level is correlated with metastatic potential. cathepsin d, a lysosomal aspartate proteolytic enzyme that is similar to cathepsin b, also plays an important role in invasion and metastasis of cancer. it is up-regulated in metastasis of some malignant tumors, including primary laryngeal cancers correlated with neck lymph node involvement  <cit> , gastric cancer with lymphatic and/or blood vessel invasion  <cit> , and breast cancer. furthermore, cheng et al.  <cit>  found that significant cathepsin d expression occurred in lymph node metastasis versus primary npc and was significantly correlated with advanced clinical stage, recurrence, and lymph node and distant metastasis. agr <dig> was reported to be linked with several human cancers and induced metastasis  <cit> . additionally, dumartin, et al.  <cit>  found that cathepsins b and d are downstream functional molecules of the proinvasive agr <dig> in vitro, and agr <dig>  cathepsins b and d were considered to be essential for dissemination of pancreatic cancer cells in vivo. high expressed-cathepsins b and d in dnp-treated 6-10b may be mediated by agr <dig>  but it is also possible that dnp directly mediated cathepsins b and d. additionally, dnp-induced 6-10b motility decreased when agr <dig> blocked . we speculated that cathepsins b, d and agr <dig> expression mediated by dnp and agr <dig> regulating cathepsins b, d are involved in npc metastasis.

significantly, akr <dig> proteins were predominantly up-regulated in high metastatic dnp-treated 6-10b cells, including akr1c <dig>  akr1b <dig>  akr1c <dig>  and akr1b <dig> . family members of akr1c play a pivotal role in maintaining steroid homeostasis and catalyzing reductive detoxification of reactive aldehydes and ketones, which are produced as a result of oxidative stress  <cit> . akr1b <dig> is also correlated positively with tumor size and lymph node metastasis  <cit> . these findings suggest that dnp would affect oxidative stress and steroid homeostasis in 6-10b cells through the above aldo-keto reductase family  <dig> proteins, thereby increasing 6-10b cell metastasis.

higher clusterin levels were expressed in various malignant tumors with metastasis including ovarian  <cit> , breast  <cit> , and gastric cancers  <cit> . an emerging query, clusterins enhanced cell invasion and metastasis of tumors through emt. lee, et al.  <cit>  found that clusterin was involved in smad2/ <dig> stability at the protein level, and believed that clusterin regulates transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway by modulating the stability of smad2/ <dig> proteins and mediates emt. lenferink et al.  <cit>  also found that clusterin gene expression was highly up-regulated throughout transforming growth factor-beta, and speculated that secreted clusterin served as an important extracellular promoter of emt. in the present study, proteins related to emt and cell adhesion were also dysregulated, including clusterin myosin-vi, catenin alpha- <dig> , fibronectin type iii domain-containing protein 3b , l <dig> cell adhesion molecule , desmoplakin, plakophilin- <dig> , implying that the mobility of dnp-induced 6-10b cells is probably related to emt and cell adhesion.

the silac technique was used to conduct a comparison of the proteomes of 6-10b cell metastasis induced by dnp. a cooperative response, including many proteins, and a group of pathways were identified and some interesting clues were provided. dnp may induce a change in abundance of mitochondrial proteins, mediate the status of oxidative stress and the imbalance of the redox state, and increase cytoskeletal protein, cathepsin, agr <dig>  and clusterin expression, and finally promote cell metastasis. dnp may be involved in npc metastasis through regulation of cancer protein synthesis, cellular movement, lipid metabolism, molecular transport, cell death, and cellular growth and proliferation signaling pathways. dnp may also induce 6-10b cells to secrete akr1b <dig>  cathepsin b and clusterin. these dataset provide important clues for investigation on high metastatic npc.
