BACKGROUND
arabidopsis thaliana has been the principal model plant for molecular developmental studies of flowers for two decades. several traits of arabidopsis contribute to its attractiveness as a model system. however, not all phenomena in angiosperm flower development are present in arabidopsis, and some processes are in fact specific to arabidopsis or its close relatives . thus, extrapolating floral developmental paradigms from arabidopsis to other flowering plants is not always straightforward  <cit> . to obtain a broader understanding of floral development, studies on species representing a broad taxonomic distribution are necessary. our research interest has focused on floral development in gerbera hybrida, a model species of the sunflower family . gerbera inflorescences consist of hundreds of flowers, which can be divided into three different types based on their size, sex, and position in the inflorescence. we have previously shown that many basic principles of floral development apply to gerbera  <cit> , but that in addition, gerbera has special features of its own  <cit> . for example, the b and c functions of the abc model of flower development  <cit>  are applicable to gerbera, but the a function has remained elusive.

based on the abc model, a function genes are involved in determining sepal and petal identity by repressing c function in whorls one and two  <cit> . arabidopsis has two a class genes apetala <dig> and apetala <dig>   <cit> . ap <dig> is a mads box gene, as are the majority of the abc function genes  <cit> , while ap <dig> is a member of the ap2/erf ethylene response family. both ap <dig> and ap <dig> act as a function genes, but they also have several other functions . ap <dig> has been shown to fulfil a dual function in specifying arabidopsis sepal and petal identity as well as affecting floral meristem development  <cit> . ap <dig> acts closely together and partially redundantly with other inflorescence architecture genes, cauliflower  and fruitfull   <cit> . despite attempts to establish similar functions for related genes in other plant species, success has been limited. for example, the antirrhinum squamosa  gene plays a role in inflorescence meristem development but does not affect floral organ identity  <cit> . a similar function has been shown for the related gene antirrhinum defh <dig>  which is not involved in determination of sepal and petal identity  <cit> . several plant species appear to have genes closely related to ap <dig>  but apparently none have similar functions in specifying sepal and petal identity  <cit> . the pea  gene peam <dig> seems to be the closest to ap <dig> in function and has been suggested to be a functional homologue of ap <dig>  <cit>  based on similar expression pattern and floral phenotype. however, several authors  <cit>  have been inclined to suggest that the entire concept of an a function might be specific to arabidopsis and perhaps other brassicaceae.

in addition to previously characterized gerbera mads box genes  <cit> , we have recently identified several gerbera genes similar to ap <dig>  ful  <cit>  and squa  <cit> . ap <dig> and squa are often described as a function genes, but only ap <dig> has characteristics of a homeotic selector gene. ap <dig> and squa do, however, play strong roles in defining floral meristem identity, together with the genes leafy in arabidopsis and floricaula in snapdragon  <cit> .

here, we analyze the expression and phylogenetic position of six gerbera genes, gerbera squamosa-like1- <dig> , which are closely related to ap <dig>  squa, and ful. our data indicate that none of the gsqua genes are, by themselves, likely to play a role in defining floral organ identity in the sense of the a function of the floral abc model  <cit> . however, gsqua <dig> does function as a strong positive regulator of meristem transition in gerbera. overexpression of gsqua <dig> in transgenic gerbera results in an early flowering dwarf phenotype, which displays abnormal vegetative architecture.

RESULTS
isolation and phylogenetic analysis of the gerbera hybrida gsqua genes
gsqua <dig> was isolated earlier by low stringency screening of an inflorescence cdna library using a spruce mads box gene probe, and was so named based of its sequence similarity to squa of antirrhinum  <cit> . pcr amplification using a degenerate mads-box specific primer yielded three additional partial sequences of gerbera squa-like genes: gqua <dig>  gsqua <dig>  and gsqua <dig>  two more squa-like genes, gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig>  were identified from a gerbera est collection  <cit> . full length cdna sequences were recovered using 5' and 3' race for all gsqua genes except for gsqua <dig> 

in arabidopsis, the a function/meristem-identity gene ap <dig> and the fruit function/meristem-identity gene ful share a high degree of sequence similarity despite their partially different functions  <cit> . the c termini of plant mads domain proteins are variable, but within closely related groups, conserved protein motifs can be recognized. both ap1- and ful-like proteins are characterized by such motifs, the euap1-motif for the former, and the paleoap1- or ful-motif for the latter  <cit> . alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence of gsqua <dig> with similar sequences from other plant species showed that gsqua <dig> contains a protein motif similar but not identical to the paleoap1/ful-motif. the same motif was also recognizable in gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig>  in contrast, gsqua <dig> possessed a euap1-motif  that is divergent from the consensus motif   <cit> , while still containing several conserved amino acids . in the previously isolated gsqua <dig> protein  <cit>  a euap1-motif was not evident, but phylogenetic analysis  nevertheless suggested a close relationship between gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig>  the deduced gerbera gsqua amino acid sequence alignments and the corresponding protein motifs are shown in figure  <dig> 

phylogenetic analysis suggested that gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig> are close paralogs, together co-orthologous to ap <dig> . similarly, gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig> are co-orthologs of ful, and gsqua <dig> is phylogenetically close to the snapdragon gene defh <dig>  although interrationships among the ap1/squa, defh <dig>  and ful clades are not well supported in the phylogenetic analysis, the conserved c terminal motifs suggest that gsqua2/defh28/amful are ful-like. the full maximum likelihood tree, based on our sequences added to the alignment of  <cit> , is shown in additional file  <dig>  an alignment of gsqua dna sequences is shown in additional file  <dig> 

rna gel blots and in situ hybridization of gsqua genes
to localize gsqua expression during the early stages of inflorescence development, a more detailed rna in situ hybridization analysis of young, developing gerbera inflorescences  was performed . in general, gsqua genes studied here showed a wide range of expression patterns. in fact, the vasculature of the capitulum receptacle was the only common location where all of the gsqua genes were expressed. in contrast to other gsqua genes, gsqua <dig> was entirely restricted to the vasculature of the capitulum receptacle and petals  <cit> .while gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig> were found to be expressed in all parts of the inflorescence, gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig> displayed a slightly narrower expression pattern at the inflorescence level. gsqua <dig> was expressed only in the reproductive organs in addition to the vasculature . figure 3b shows examples of developing individual ray flowers, while the summary in figure 3a is based on larger number of in situ hybridizations. gsqua <dig> expression was also seen in the receptacle between the emerging individual flowers  and petal expression was localized to the adaxial surfaces . the location of emerging flowers in the developing inflorescence was marked by strong gsqua <dig> expression even before clear anatomical differentiation was visible at the center of the capitulum  .

phenotypic changes in gsqua <dig> overexpression lines
for functional analysis, we were only able to obtain clear and consistent phenotypes by overexpressing gsqua <dig>  transformation of gerbera with gsqua <dig> under the 35s promoter yielded five lines strongly overexpressing gsqua <dig> and one line with weaker overexpression, which correlated with milder phenotypic changes . compared to the non-transformed gerbera cultivar 'terra regina', all strong overexpression lines showed altered vegetative growth very early in development. the posture of the plants was upright, with leaves curving adaxially. the normal growth habit that leads to a tight rosette-like arrangement of leaves in gerbera  <cit>  was loosened, with the segments/vegetative axis of the stem strongly elongated. inflorescences started to form after only two months in the greenhouse whereas the wild type cultivar 'terra regina' typically reaches the flowering stage after  <dig> months . root formation of the overexpression plants was poor. the plants were susceptible to molds in greenhouse conditions and they typically died after forming only a few inflorescences. transformants grown in more controlled and contamination-free growth chamber conditions survived for longer periods of time. the general appearance of overexpression lines of gsqua <dig> was unstable due to their aberrant architecture, and they required support to remain upright. one milder phenotype was also observed . this line was not as dramatically dwarfed, but was clearly smaller and more delicate in structure, both vegetatively and inflorescence-wise, as compared to non-transgenic plants. rna gel blot analysis showed strong expression for gsqua <dig> in the inflorescence, but overexpression in leaves was weaker compared to overexpression lines showing the dwarfed phenotype .

the number of flowers in the inflorescence of gsqua <dig> overexpression lines was reduced compared to wild type. non-transformed gerbera 'terra regina' inflorescences, grown side by side with the transformants in the greenhouse, contained on average about  <dig> individual flowers. the gsqua <dig> overexpression lines produced on average only  <dig> flowers in their inflorescences .

* significant at p <  <dig>  

inflorescences upregulated for gsqua <dig> contain less than 50% of flowers of wild type gerbera.

inspection of gsqua <dig> overexpression lines with stereomicroscopy or scanning electron microscopy showed no homeotic changes in floral organs of any flower type . however, petals of all flower types were shorter compared to the wild type petals, which is congruent with dwarfism and the overall smaller size of the inflorescence. additionally, inflorescence color differed from wild type in being paler. despite three transgenic lines producing antisense rna for gsqua <dig>  no silencing of the endogenous gsqua <dig> was observed.

discussion
the gsqua subfamily of mads box genes contains at least six members in gerbera
in addition to the previously published gerbera squa-like genes, gsqua <dig>  <cit> , gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig>  <cit> , we isolated three new sequences, gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig>  the number of gsqua genes is large compared to most other plant species and it is tempting to relate this diversity to the complex structure of the gerbera inflorescence  <cit> . arabidopsis ap <dig> and ful, which function in sepal and petal, fruit, and meristem development  <cit> , are closely related to gsquas at the sequence level. the relationship of the two arabidopsis proteins has been further analyzed by  <cit>  and  <cit> , and they described conserved c-terminal protein motifs  in a number of ap1- and ful like sequences. identification of these motifs facilitates the classification of related proteins, since phylogenetic analysis of ap1- and ful-like sequences is not always unambiguous. the paleoap1/ful-like protein sequences have a hydrophobic motif , which is not found in euap1-like sequences. euap1-like sequences in turn have two conserved motifs, a transcription activation domain rrnalalt/nla  and a farnesylation signal caax  that terminates the protein. a farnesylation motif generally directs proteins to a membrane  <cit> , but the role of farnesylation in plant proteins might be more diverse  <cit> . in the case of transcription factors, this function could be part of post-transcriptional regulation, or necessary for protein complex formation  <cit> . ap <dig> has been shown to be farnesylated in planta, but membrane localization was not observed  <cit> . not all euap1-like proteins possess this farnesylation signal, however, and thus it may not be an essential part of the protein function  <cit> .

based on the presence of conserved c terminal protein motifs, gsqua <dig> can be classified as belonging to the euap1-like proteins, while gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig> harbor a paleoap1/ful-like protein motif at the c terminus of their amino acid sequence . gsqua <dig> does not possess a recognizable protein motif of either type at its c terminal end, but phylogenetic analysis places it close to gsqua <dig> . in fact, the gsqua <dig> sequence terminates  <dig> amino acids before the expected euap <dig> protein motif. furthermore, the gsqua <dig> protein sequence contains the transcriptional activation domain rsneldlsl, but no strong transcriptional activation was seen in yeast assays  <cit> . the motif differs slightly from the consensus motif rrnalalt/nla  <cit> , the second arginine being replaced by serine in gsqua <dig> and threonine or asparagine being substituted for serine. the functional relevance of these changes is not clear. despite the close sequence similarity in the c terminal domain of gsqua <dig> to related proteins such as ap <dig> and squa  <cit> , the farnesylation domain of gsqua <dig>  differs from the most common version of the motif, cfaa/t  <cit> , which is found in many plant squa-like proteins  <cit> . euap1-protein motifs similar to gerbera gsqua <dig> are also present in related protein sequences of other species in asteraceae, including sunflower  and chrysanthemum    <cit> . still, these asteraceae specific variants are within the definition of the farnesylation motif caax  <cit> . the current definition of the consensus motif is possibly too narrow, and as more plant species are studied in detail, the farnesylation consensus motif may require redefinition.

a detailed phylogenetic analysis of gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig> produced results in line with the relationships suggested by analysis of c terminal protein motifs. the maximum likelihood tree suggests that gsqua <dig> may be orthologous to the snapdragon gene defh <dig>  which is involved in the regulation of floral meristem identity and fruit development  <cit> . both of these defh <dig> functions are similar to ful of arabidopsis, and the authors concluded that defh <dig> most likely represents the ortholog of ful. however, this interpretation was later challenged by  <cit>  based on the discovery of amful, which, according to phylogenetic and protein motif analysis more likely represents the snapdragon gene orthologous to ful. unfortunately, amful has not been further characterized. gsqua <dig> does share the early flowering function of defh <dig>  however. a potential role of gsqua <dig> in fruit development was not studied in this work.

previous and recent studies on ful-like genes further distinguish two groups  <cit> . ful and amful belong to the euful group  <cit> , while agl <dig> and defh <dig> belong to eufulii group  <cit> . based on the phylogenetic analysis gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig>  and gsqua <dig> genes are closer to the euful group, while gsqua <dig> belongs to the eufulii group.

gsqua <dig>  <cit>  and gsqua <dig> appear to be recent paralogs and are co-orthologous to squa of snapdragon  <cit> . similarly, gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig> are coorthologous to ful of arabidopsis  <cit> .

the expression patterns for gsqua genes do not support a homeotic a function
all gsqua genes, despite being closely related, exhibit different expression patterns at the vegetative and floral organ levels. however, none of the gsqua genes investigated share the expression pattern of arabidopsis ap <dig> or snapdragon squa in the sense that they would be particularly abundant in floral whorls  <dig> and  <dig>  in early stages of development. in general, at earlier developmental stages, expression domains of gsquas are widespread at the inflorescence level, with the exception of gsqua <dig>  which is expressed in reproductive organs and in the vasculature of the capitulum receptacle . only later in floral development gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig> are weakly expressed in sepals and petals . the expression in vasculature is common among all gsqua genes studied here. expression in vasculature is also known for ful  <cit>  and amful  <cit> , but vascular expression is not a uniform trait for euap1-, euful- or eufulii-like genes. this expression pattern may reflect a function in developing vascular bundles, but the phenomenon has not been extensively discussed previously and its functional significance for gsqua genes remains unclear.

the broad expression pattern of gsqua <dig> during early stages of ray flower development resembles what has been previously reported for ful and other ful-like genes, and contrasts with the expression of ap <dig>  which is confined to the first two whorls  <cit> . ful-like genes are commonly expressed in the carpel  <cit> , meristems  <cit>  and vegetative tissues, including bracts  <cit> . expression has also been observed in the inflorescence  <cit> , floral meristems  <cit> , stamens  <cit> , and perianth organs  <cit> . for some species, expression has been visible in all floral whorls  <cit> . the expression pattern for arabidopsis ful is biphasic, which is in accordance with its early  and late  functions in reproductive development  <cit> .

the functional role of ful in fruit development was first detected in arabidopsis mutant lines lacking ful expression. gerbera does not bear a fruit similar to arabidopsis; its ovary position is inferior as opposed to superior in arabidopsis and the fruits  are indehiscent. thus the late function for gsqua <dig> might be entirely different  or lacking completely. the most dramatic phenotypic effects in 35s::ful lines are cell type changes in valve margins and the outer replum, which lead to developmental failure of the dehiscence zone and eventually to indehiscent fruit  <cit> . interestingly, gsqua <dig> expresses strongly in ovary inner walls and the ovule , so despite the fact that no homeotic changes in gsqua <dig> overexpression lines were visible in ovaries and ovules at the relatively late developmental stage  <dig>  a role for gsqua <dig> in gerbera fruit development, possibly at the level of cell differentiation, cannot be ruled out.

gsqua <dig> is involved in meristem transition
among the several related gsqua genes of gerbera, only gsqua <dig> lent itself to further functional characterization based on transgenic gerbera lines overexpressing the gene. several transgenic lines both for gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig> were generated and analyzed for overexpression and downregulation, but no consistent floral phenotypes were observed. both genes, gsqua <dig> and ful, seem to share the same function of meristem identity determination in early floral development, but the inflorescence abundance of gsqua <dig> expression distinguishes it from ful, as ful is expressed also in vegetative parts of arabidopsis  <cit> . however, when gsqua <dig> is ectopically expressed throughout gerbera tissues, dramatic vegetative changes such as dwarfism and vegetative axis elongation appear. gerbera growth habit is sympodial with very short, leafy lateral shoots forming the sympodia. typically, the sympodial rhizome forms 7- <dig> leaves before the first inflorescence is formed by the apical meristem. two inflorescences are formed per one vegetative shoot, the second inflorescence being formed in the axil of the uppermost leaf primordium. the vegetative axis continues to develop in the axil of the second leaf primordium. the fully-formed axis grows 2- <dig> leaves before forming a terminal inflorescence, a lateral inflorescence, and again a vegetative shoot, the growth cycle being iterative  <cit> . the vegetative axis between lateral shoots is very short and the lateral shoots form a tightly packed entity. however, in plants overexpressing gsqua <dig>  the vegetative axis between lateral shoots is strongly elongated compared to wild type gerberas . the poor root formation of the overexpression lines may be to ectopic expression of gsqua <dig> under the 35s promoter, which interferes with the normal root development and is thus not necessarily informative of the gene's normal function.

overexpression lines of gsqua <dig> flower substantially earlier than wild type plants, which suggests this gene to be involved in floral meristem transition. the strong localized expression of gsqua <dig> in emerging flower primordia at the early stages of flower development also supports this hypothesis . despite of the strong expression in overexpression lines, only minor morphological changes, such as reduced petal size and color, were detected at the level of individual flowers. at the inflorescence level, however, a considerably reduced number of flowers was observed, since the overexpression lines for gsqua <dig> contained only half the number of flowers in their inflorescences as non-transgenic gerbera. a similar phenomenon was reported with birch bpmads <dig> overexpression lines  <cit> , and may relate to accelerated development, including accelerated consumption of the inflorescence meristem.

in wheat and ryegrass, the ap1-like mads-box gene vrn <dig> is expressed in vegetative tissues and has been suggested to control the transition to flowering  <cit> . based on the vegetative expression pattern, gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig> are gerbera candidates for this kind of function, but at least for gsqua <dig> we have data that its ectopic expression does not cause early flowering.

in arabidopsis, accelerated flowering is regularly observed when different mads-box genes are overexpressed, including those not directly related to flowering time  <cit> . in gerbera, all overexpression lines with mads box genes other than gsqua <dig> have retained their normal vegetative size and flowering time, although many have displayed homeotic or meristem identity changes in the inflorescences  <cit> .

gsqua proteins interact with other gerbera mads domain proteins
ap1/squa-like mads domain proteins have been suggested to function as mediators of higher order complex formation, acting as 'bridge proteins' and facilitating the formation of protein quartets  <cit> . however, based on pairwise assays  <cit> , gsqua proteins seem unlikely to function as interaction mediators in gerbera, since their interaction capacity appears to be limited  <cit> . this feature distinguishes all gsqua proteins from the closely related petunia protein fbp <dig>  fbp <dig> is capable of interacting with several mads domain proteins of different functional classes  <cit> . moreover, other ful-like proteins from petunia, pfg and fbp <dig>  show more extensive interaction capacity than the studied gsqua proteins  <cit> . also arabidopsis ful was shown to be active in multiple protein-protein interactions  <cit> . gsqua <dig> was found to interact with three other gerbera mads domain proteins in a screen of fourteen proteins, whereas gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig> proteins interacted with only two other proteins, all partners being members of the sep-like grcd family of gerbera proteins. gsqua <dig> remained inactive in pairwise assay showing no interaction with any tested gerbera proteins. the most interesting gsqua <dig> specific partner is grcd <dig>  a pleiotropically active gerbera sep-like protein with functions in carpel identity, meristem identity and inflorescence determinacy  <cit> . interestingly, when gsqua <dig> and grcd <dig> were combined in yeast, a strong autoactivation function emerged - separately, neither of the proteins show transcriptional activation. this function of the gsqua2/grcd <dig> dimer could reflect its importance in gerbera floral development. both gsqua <dig> and grcd <dig> are co-expressed in young inflorescences and their expression patterns are overlapping  <cit> , rendering the interaction feasible also in planta.

when assaying for higher order complex formation, gsqua proteins showed greater activity. together with the gerbera b function dimer gglo1/gdef <dig>  and when combined with a gerbera sep-like grcd protein and with a c function gaga protein, all gsqua proteins showed activity  <cit> . while gsqua proteins did not interact with each other in the pairwise assays, addition of a grcd protein made some complexes with two gsqua proteins stable in yeast.

even as interaction of gsquas with e function proteins  or with b function proteins  can be seen as consistent with a homeotic a function for gsquas, interaction with c function proteins  is not. in arabidopsis, expression of ap <dig>  is excluded in cells where the c-function gene agamous  is expressed  <cit> . ap <dig> alone does not repress the c function in whorls one and two, but rather acts together with the non-mads proteins leunig and seuss  <cit>  in a complex including other mads domain proteins, agl <dig> and svp  <cit> . however the ag gene has functions beyond the floral homeotic one in arabidopsis. ag is known to control the meristematic state of flower primordia and to downregulate the meristem organizing gene wuschel together with unknown factors  <cit>  which in petunia are mads domain proteins  <cit> .

it is tempting to relate the large number of squa-like genes in gerbera to the complex structure of the inflorescence in asteraceae. at least some interactions for homologous chrysanthemum mads domain proteins are similar to the gerbera proteins. cdm <dig>  which is closely related to gsqua proteins, interacts with chrysanthemum cdm <dig>  which is homologous to sep <dig> of arabidopsis  <cit> . this interaction is similar to gsquas' interaction with grcd <dig> and grcd <dig>  in yeast three-hybrid assay, cdm <dig> combined with the chrysanthemum b protein heterodimer , and the complex was active, as are gerbera complexes with a gsqua protein and the b protein dimer. sunflower  also contains several genes closely related to ap <dig> and ful  <cit> . obviously duplication of this lineage of genes has also taken place in sunflower. perhaps gene duplication and divergence in the squa/ap1/ful gene lineage has participated, together with the unique diversity in tcp family transcription factors  <cit>  to help shape the complex asteraceae inflorescence.

CONCLUSIONS
gerbera has an array of squa-like genes, which can be classified either as euap1-like, or as ful-like  <cit> . however, none of these genes appear to act as an a function gene in the sense of the classical abc model  <cit> . based on these results, gerbera can be added to the growing list of plant species that lack the a function comparable to arabidopsis. gsqua <dig> is intimately involved in the regulation of meristem transition in gerbera as overexpression of gsqua <dig> led to accelerated flowering. the role of gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig>  and gsqua <dig> in the floral development of gerbera requires further study. the complex inflorescence structure and the high number of gerbera gsqua-like genes lead to a temptation to associate these two phenomena, but verifying this hypothesis requires more research.
