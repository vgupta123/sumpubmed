BACKGROUND
genotyping is a common technique used in association studies of diseases and cancers. although many high-throughput platforms of single nucleotide polymorphism  genotyping, such as snp array  <cit>  and real-time pcr using taqman probes  <cit> , have been introduced, most laboratories still validate snp or novel mutation by pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism  genotyping  <cit>  because this method is inexpensive for small-scale genotyping. one shortcoming of pcr-rflp is its long digestion time  for restriction enzymes  <cit> .

recently, a restriction enzyme-free snp genotyping technique called "pcr with confronting two-pair primers " was developed  <cit> . it has been applied successfully to at least  <dig> different snp genotypings. for example, interleukin-1b  c-31t, interleukin- <dig>  -330g, beta2-adrenergic receptor  gln27glu, and aldehyde dehydrogenase  <dig>  were genotyped by pcr-ctpp for association studies with smoking behavior  <cit> , pylori-induced gastric atrophy  <cit> , severe coronary artery disease  <cit> , and esophageal cancer risk  <cit> , respectively. there is no doubt that the pcr-ctpp method is suitable and reliable for most cases of snps. this method considerably lowers the need to consume restriction enzymes. however, the criteria for the pcr-ctpp primers are only tolerant of a small difference in melting temperature  between the four primers in the pcr-ctpp method  <cit> . moreover, typical primer design constraints also need to be considered, such as primer length, primer length difference, pcr product length, gc proportion, melting temperature , gc clamp, dimer , hairpin structure, and specificity. hence, the computational requirements needed to improve the primer design with pcr-cttp are rather high.

to design ctpp primers with many corresponding constraints, we introduce a genetic algorithm   <cit>  to improve the design of ctpp primer sets. ga is a stochastic search algorithm modeled on the process of natural selection underlying biological evolution  <cit> . it constitutes a randomized search and an optimization technique that derives its working principle from natural genetics. since ga computation is similar in nature to the evolution of the species, it best fits dna behavior associated with snp interaction  <cit>  and general primer design  <cit> . the evolutionary computations involved, such as selection, crossover and mutation, are effective in achieving optimal solutions for many ctpp primer sets. after each run, chromosomes in a ga share information with each other and the superior solutions based on a fitness rule are refined from generation to generation. therefore, ctpp primers obeying the typical primer design constraints described above can be mined.

methods
problem formulation
the ctpp primer design problem can be described as follows. let td be a template dna sequence, which is composed of nucleotide codes with an identified snp. td is defined by:

  td={bi| i is the index of dna sequence,1≤ i ≤ι, ∃ !bi∈iupac code of snp} 

where bi is the regular nucleotide code  mixed with a single iupac code of snp  . for the target snp, we focused only on true snps described in dbsnp  <cit>  of ncbi, i.e., deletion/insertion polymorphisms  and multi-nucleotide polymorphisms  are not included.

the ctpp primer design requires two pairs of short sequences which are constraining in td based on a defined snp site as illustrated . the forward primer  <dig>  is a short sense sequence in the upstream  of a defined snp site for some distances; the reverse primer  <dig>  is a short antisense sequence which contains a nucleotide  located at its 3' end; the forward primer  <dig>  is a short sense sequence which contains a nucleotide  located at its 3' end; and the reverse primer  <dig>  is the antisense sequence in the upstream of a defined snp site for some distances. these four primers are defined as follows:

  pr1={bi¯|i is the index of td, rs1 ≤ i ≤re1} 

  pr1={bi¯|i is the index of td, rs1 ≤ i ≤re1} 

  pf2={bi|i is the index of td, fs2 ≤ i ≤fe2} 

  pr2={bi¯|i is the index of td, rs2 ≤ i ≤re2} 

where both pf1/pr <dig> and pf2/pr <dig> are two primer pairs of pcr-ctpp. fs <dig> vs. fe <dig> and rs <dig> vs. re <dig> indicate the start index vs. the end index of pf <dig> and pr <dig> in td, respectively. fs <dig> vs. fe <dig> and rs <dig> vs. re <dig> indicate the start index vs. the end index of pf <dig> and pr <dig> in td, respectively. b¯i is the complementary nucleotide of bi, which is described in formula . for example, if bi = 'a', then b¯i = 't'; if bi = 'c', then b¯i = 'g', and vice versa.

the target snp site is defined at the end positions of pf <dig> and pr <dig>  which are indicated by the symbols fe <dig> and re <dig>  respectively. as described in figure  <dig>  a vector  with fl <dig>  pl <dig>  rl <dig>  fl <dig>  pl <dig> and rl <dig> is essential to design the ctpp primer sets. this vector is defined as follows:

  pv= 

fl <dig>  pl <dig>  rl <dig>  fl <dig>  pl <dig> and rl <dig> represent the lengths of forward primer  <dig>  pcr product between pf <dig> and pr <dig>  reverse primer  <dig>  forward primer  <dig>  pcr product between pf <dig> and pr <dig> and reverse primer  <dig>  respectively. consequently, the forward and reverse primers can be acquired from pv, which is the prototype of a chromosome in ga and is used to perform evolutionary computations as described in the following sections.

definition of the fitness function
the regular primer design constraints are used as values to design a fitness function to minimize the fitness value. the fitness function is defined as follows:

  fitness=3*+gcproportion+ gcclamp)+10*+ hairpin+specificity)+ 50* +tmdiff)+ 100*vg_tmdiff+ 60*pcrlen 

the weights  of the fitness function are applied to estimate the importance of the primer constraints. these weights are set according to the experiential conditions for pcr-ctpp. they also accept adjustment based on the user experimental requirements.

primer length
the feasible primer length for a pcr experiment is set between  <dig> and  <dig> bp. for longer primers, the tm is increased whereas the tm of relatively short primers is decreased. accordingly, primers which are neither too long nor too short are suitable. we have limited the random values of fl <dig>  rl <dig>  fl <dig> and rl <dig> in an appropriate range; therefore, the primer length estimation is not considered to be joined to the fitness function.

a length difference  of less than or equal to  <dig> bp between the fl1/rl <dig>  fl2/rl <dig>  and fl1/rl <dig> primer sets is considered optimal. the primer length difference function is defined as follows:

  lendiff={defect_value=3if abs ≤ <dig>    then defect_value−1if abs  ≤ <dig>    then defect_value−1if abs ≤ <dig>    then defect_value−1return defect_value 

where lendiff has a maximal fitness value of 3; the fitness value is decreased when the length difference between a primer pair is less than or equal to  <dig> bp. abs represents the absolute value.

gc content and gc clamp
the function gc% is proposed to represent the ratio of g and c nucleotides appearing in a primer:

  gc%=gnumber+cnumber|p| 

where p represents a primer and | p | represents the length of primer p; gnumber and cnumber represent the numbers of the nucleotides g and c, respectively.

in general primer design, the typical gc proportion constraint is set between 40% and 60%. however, the designed ctpp primers contain the target snp to limit the range of the gc proportion. to relax this constraint, the constraint of gc proportion in a primer is adjusted to between 20% and 80%. function gcproportion is proposed with a maximal fitness value of  <dig> to lead the gc% of ctpp primers corresponding to this constraint:

  gcproportion={defect_value=4if 20≤gc%≤ <dig>    then defect_value−1if 20≤gc%≤ <dig>    then defect_value−1if 20≤gc%≤ <dig>    then defect_value−1if 20≤gc%≤ <dig>    then defect_value−1return defect_value 

to meet the presence of g or c nucleotides at the 3' terminal of a primer to ensure a tight localized hybridization bond, the function gcclamp is proposed with the maximal fitness value of  <dig> as follows:

  gcclamp={defect_value=4if 3'  end of pf1  is 'g' or 'c',  then  defect_value−1if  3'  end of pr1  is 'g' or 'c',  then defect_value−1if 3'  end of pf2  is 'g' or 'c',  then defect_value−1if  3'  end  of pr2  is 'g' or 'c',  then defect_value−1return  defect_value 

melting temperature
the melting temperature  for each ctpp primer must be considered carefully for pcr experiments. here, we do not use the rough estimate  <dig> ×  +  <dig> × , but a more elaborate equation containing the ionic strength, g and c content and length of the primer is concerned. the tm calculation formula for a primer is described as follows:

  tmbm= <dig> + <dig> *+  <dig> *–675/|p| 

where p represents a primer and | p | represents the length of primer p; na+ is the molar salt concentration. the suffix bm represents the formula which was proposed by bolton and mccarthy  <cit> .

the function tm is proposed to confine a ctpp primer set ranging from 45°c and 62°c with the maximal fitness value of 4:

  tm={defect_value=4if 45≤tmbm ≤ <dig>   then defect_value−1if 45≤tmbm ≤ <dig>    then defect_value−1if 45≤tmbm ≤ <dig>    then defect_value−1if 45≤tmbm ≤ <dig>    then defect_value−1return defect_value 

similar tm between a primer pair is important to perform experiment in the same tube. the function tmdiff is proposed with the maximal fitness value of  <dig> to guide the difference of the melting temperatures to less than or equal to 1°c:

  tmdiff={defect_value=3if abs −tmb)≤ <dig>   then defect_value−1if abs −tmb)≤ <dig>   then defect_value−1if abs −tmb)≤ <dig>   then defect_value−1return  defect_value 

in order to balance the tm values among a ctpp primers, function avg_tmdiff is proposed to calculate the average tm difference:

  avg_tmdiff=/ <dig> 

dimer and hairpin
primer dimers , such as cross-dimers  and self-dimers  must also be avoided. to check for the occurrence of primer dimers, the function dimer is proposed with the maximal fitness value of 10:

  dimer={defect_value = 10if do not form a cross -dimer,  then defect_value−1if do not form a cross -dimer,  then defect_value−1if do not form a cross -dimer,  then defect_value−1if do not form a cross-dimer,  then defect_value−1if do not form a cross-dimer,  then defect_value−1if do not form a cross-dimer,  then defect_value−1if do not form a self-dimer,  then defect_value−1if do not form a self-dimer,  then defect_value−1if do not form a self-dimer,  then defect_value−1if do not form a self-dimer,  then defect_value−1return defect_value 

the hairpin check is also implemented to avoid annealing due to the secondary structure of a primer. to check for the presence of a hairpin structure in ctpp primers, the function hairpin is proposed with the maximal fitness value of  <dig> as follows:

  hairpin={defect_value=4if pf1 do not form a hairpin,   then defect_value−1if pr1 do not form a hairpin,  then defect_value−1if pf2 do not form a hairpin,  then defect_value−1if pr2 do not form a hairpin,  then defect_value−1return defect_value 

specificity
subsequently, the function specificity is proposed to check for repetition of each ctpp primer in the template dna sequence to ensure its specificity. the pcr experiment may fail when a designed primer is not sequence-specific . the fitness value of the primers  appearing in td is evaluated using a binary value, i.e., when the primers repeatedly appear in td, the specificity is defined as 1; or else the specificity is defined as  <dig> 

pcr product length
finally, the function pcrlen is proposed with the maximal fitness value of  <dig> to calculate the appropriate lengths of the pcr products. three ratios - i.e. ratio <dig>  ratio <dig> and ratio <dig> - are introduced to the function pcrlen representing pl <dig>  pl <dig> and pl <dig>  respectively. the minimum length of pcr products needs to be greater than  <dig> bp.

  pcrlen={defect_value=7if pl1  > 100 , then defect_value−1if pl2 > 100 , then defect_value−1if pl3  >  <dig>  then defect_value−1if pl1 corresponds ratio <dig>   then defect_value−1if pl2 corresponds ratio <dig>   then defect_value−1if pl3 corresponds ratio <dig>   then defect_value−1if all pl1 and pl2 and pl3 correspond their ratios,  then defect_value−1return defect_value 

algorithm
the proposed algorithm consists of five processes:  random initial population,  fitness evaluation,  selection, crossover, and mutation,  replacement, and  judgment on termination conditions. figure  <dig> shows the flowchart of ga-based ctpp primer design. the five processes are described below:

 random initial population
to start the algorithm, chromosomes pv =  of particular number are randomly generated for an initial population without duplicates. fl <dig>  rl <dig>  fl <dig> and rl <dig> are randomly generated between the minimum and the maximum of the primer length constraint. the minimum and maximum lengths of the primer length constraint are set to  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively. the pcr product lengths, pl <dig> and pl <dig> are randomly generated between  <dig> bp and δ <dig>  and between  <dig> bp and δ <dig>  respectively. 

 fitness evaluation
the fitness value in the fitness function is used to ascertain that an individual chromosome is either good or bad. we use formula  to evaluate the fitness values of all chromosomes in the population for related chromosomal operations later.

 selection, crossover, and mutation
in ga, the processes for evolutionary computation include selection, crossover and mutation. here, random selection is applied to select two chromosomes from the population. the two selected chromosomes are processed by the crossover operation. uniform crossover is used to implement the crossover operation. the flowchart of the crossover process is shown in figure  <dig>  and an example of the crossover operation is shown in figure  <dig>  one-point mutation is applied in the proposed ga. the mutation process flowchart is shown in figure  <dig>  and an example of the mutation operation is shown in figure  <dig> 

 replacement
after the evolutionary computation processes have been implemented, the two worst chromosomes in a population are replaced by the new offsprings, and the process is repeated in the next generation.

 judgment on termination conditions
once an optimal solution of chromosomes  or the maximum number of iterations is achieved, the ga is terminated.

other important criteria for ctpp primer design
there is already one alternative nucleotide in the defined snp for the ctpp primers pf <dig> and pr <dig>  if a further snp exists in any other ctpp primers, such as pf <dig> and pr <dig>  the tm between all primers is more dynamic and is difficult to optimize. accordingly, we avoid designing primers pf <dig> and pr <dig> with extra snps, i.e., all the designed primers for pf <dig> and pr <dig> including snps are eliminated without further processing.

RESULTS
dry dock experiments
the environment
the proposed algorithm was run using xeon cpu  <dig>  ghz ×  <dig> and  <dig> gb ram under the microsoft windows xp sp <dig> and java  <dig>  platforms.

parameter settings
four main parameters are set for the proposed algorithm, i.e. the number of iterations , the population size, the probability of crossover and the probability of mutation. the respective values were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ; the values are based on dejong and spears' parameter settings  <cit> . the population size was then set at  <dig> and the other parameters were held constant; only the population size was increased . the pcr product length was set to three ratios  at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, which allowed for the distinct separation of pcr bands via gel electrophoresis. these ratios were chosen based on our previously conducted pcr experiments.

results for ga-based ctpp primer design in the example of the slc6a <dig> gene
a point mutation in the slc6a <dig> gene was recently identified and shown to be associated with autism spectrum disorders  <cit> , psychosis  <cit> , and bipolar  <cit>  patients. the slc6a <dig> gene is the member  <dig> for a solute carrier family  <dig> . the common constraints for ctpp primer design were used, including a flanking length of  <dig> bp, primer length of between 16~ <dig> bp, gc% between 20~80%, primer tm between  <dig> and 62°c, difference of ctpp primer tm of less than 1°c, product length larger than  <dig> bp, and clearly separated pcr bands in gel electrophoresis. the snps for slc6a <dig> gene  are used as an example in this study which excluded the deletion/insertion polymorphisms  and multi-nucleotide polymorphisms . these snps were retrieved with  <dig> bp flanking length  from snp-flankplus   <cit> ; the reference cluster ids of these snps are shown in http://bio.kuas.edu.tw/ga-ctpp/dataset.jsp.

the entire ctpp primer set results are provided at http://bio.kuas.edu.tw/ga-ctpp/appendix.jsp and statistics of the results based on the common constraints of ga-based ctpp primers are shown in table  <dig>  for the  <dig> snps, there are  <dig> representative primers for gc%, gc clamp, tm, hairpin and specificity criteria . for the length difference, tm difference and the product length criteria, there are only  <dig> . the number of dimer is  <dig> . the primer lengths are all between  <dig> and  <dig> bp. in id <dig> as shown in table  <dig>  the parameter settings are based on dejong and spears, the designed primer length difference violated the parameter settings for  <dig> primers . most of the primer length differences were between  <dig> and  <dig> bp . for gc%,  <dig> primers were less than 20%,  <dig> primers were more than 80% and the gc% distribution was mainly between 30% and 70% . approximately half of the primers  did not satisfy the gc clamp criteria. most of the designed primers also satisfied tm ; however, only approximately  <dig> %  of the primer pairs satisfied the tm difference criteria. the criteria for product length were satisfied in approximately  <dig> %  of the designed primer pairs. for the criteria for primer dimer, hairpin and specificity, few primers were problematic .

* the results of id  <dig> and id <dig> are the parameter settings based on dejong and spears but id <dig> is modified with an increased population size to  <dig> 

genotyping experiment
materials
one snp rs <dig> in the slc6a <dig> gene was taken as an example for the genotyping test. three dna samples with three known different snp genotypes for rs <dig> were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ga-based ctpp primer design.

validation of snp genotyping by ga-based pcr-ctpp and taqman probe
the designed ctpp primer set for rs <dig> in the slc6a <dig> gene is given in table  <dig>  dna samples were added to the pcr reaction mixture  containing  <dig> μl of 10× pcr buffer,  <dig>  μl of  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  μl of  <dig> mm dntps,  <dig>  μl of dmso,  <dig>  μl of  <dig> u platinum taq enzyme ,  <dig>  μl of  <dig> μg/ml primer mix , and  <dig>  μl of dna in water. primer mixtures of several combinations were used: pf1/pr <dig> and pf2/pr <dig>  and pf1/pr <dig> . the used pcr program had the following paramaters: 94°c ;  <dig> cycles at 94°c for , 50°c for , 72°c ; and 72°c . pcr products were separated by electrophoresis on a  <dig> % regular agarose gel followed by ethidium bromide staining.

the bold font represents a snp.

in the principle of pcr-ctpp, two paired primers  should be placed in one tube. accordingly, when it is succeeded, two dna bands are amplified for the heterozygotes and three dna bands for the heterozygotes. as shown in figure 7a, the samples were performed in pcr-cttp using four ctpp primers  within one tube . moreover, we also performed these pcr reactions separately for each set of ctpp primers , to clearly validate the performance for each combination of the ctpp primers  designed by our proposed computational algorithm.

as in figure 7a for either the four ctpp primers or three different sets of two combined ctpp primers, the samples with aa genotype showed aa-negative for 228-bp  and aa-positive for 105-  and 294-bp ; the samples with cc genotype showed cc-negative for 105-bp and cc-positive for 228- and 294-bp; and the samples with ac genotype showed ac-positive for 228-, 105- and 294-bp. accordingly, the bands of the a- and c-alleles-specific pcr amplifications were successfully demonstrated for aa/ac  and cc/ac , respectively. the internal positive pcr controls for all alleles  were confirmed. therefore, it is clearly demonstrated that our proposed algorithm is able to provide the validated primers for pcr-ctpp.

using the same samples in figure 7a, the ctpp results were examined further using the taqman probes which were abi no. hcv_ <dig>  vic-/fam-labels for acacatagaaagttacagactagcagtctggtattcataaagaattgtga, respectively. the taqman probe program was performed by a  <dig> step-protocol built-in the abi real-time system , 95°c,  <dig> min , 95°c,  <dig> sec , and 60°c,  <dig> min.). as shown in figure 7b, the samples with aa, ac, and cc genotypes for rs <dig> in pcr-ctpp results  were confirmed to be the same using the taqman probe assay. therefore, the primer information for pcr-ctpp designed by our proposed algorithm was well proved.

discussion
to date, many primer design approaches have been proposed, such as dynamic programming  <cit> , parthenogenetic algorithm mg-pga  <cit> , greedy algorithm  <cit> , heuristic algorithm  <cit> , genetic algorithm  <cit> , memetic algorithm  <cit>  and any others. however, most of these methods do not provide the snp genotyping function. in contrast, we reported the brief idea of the ga-ctpp method for primer design of snp genotyping in the ieee bibe  <dig> conference  <cit> . the differences between them and the improvements of the algorithm proposed in this study are described in the additional file  <dig>  in this study, we present an improved ga-based algorithm which has been shown to be a robust search and optimization method for a number of practical problems, especially for highly complex problems for snp genotyping with the ctpp primers design function. we had used electrophoresis to validate the reliability of the ga-based ctpp primer design method.

influence of annealing temperatures
in pcr-ctpp, the designed annealing temperatures of primers are more important than in pcr-rflp. when the tm value is similar among the four primers of pcr-ctpp, the pcr competition between all possible dna products is balanced  <cit> . when the annealing temperature is low, the pcr reactions are non-specific, leading to incorrect heterozygous genotyping. therefore, a competitive or specific amplification is important to correctly genotype snps using pcr-ctpp. this problem is resolved by computationally finding similar tm values for the four ctpp primers and by experimentally adjusting the annealing temperature for the pcr  <cit> . the ga used in this study to design the pcr-ctpp primers improves the efficiency by finding almost identical tm values for the four primers. the in silico testing of the proposed ga-based pcr-ctpp primer design showed it to fit the tm constraint to the primers reliably .

typical primer design constraints concerned
since the tm is important to our proposed ga-based pcr-ctpp method, further basic research is required to determine other factors to improve this automated pcr-ctpp system. this study is also concerned with the typical primer design constraints, such as primer length, primer length difference, gc proportion, gc clamp, dimer of primer pair , hairpin, pcr product length and specificity etc. as described in the methods section.

effect of population size
dejong and spears' parameter settings are the standard for most gas, and for this reason, they were used in the present study. typically, crossover is usually applied at more than or equal to the rate of  <dig> , and the mutation rate is equal to  <dig>   <cit> . however, the population size  <dig> of dejong and spears's parameter settings is too small to provide the necessary sampling accuracy for the design of ctpp primer sets. consequently, we tested the population size for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> to evaluate the primer design performance. when the population size was increased to  <dig>  it provides the more accurate sampling . as shown in table  <dig> id <dig>  the number of primers that satisfy the constraints was increased to  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the tm and the tm difference constraint, respectively. for other constraints, the numbers of satisfied constraints were almost similar. the results demonstrate that the increased population size can aid in the search for more feasible ctpp primer sets.

available for ga-ctpp
the ga-ctpp can be accessed at http://bio.kuas.edu.tw/ga-ctpp/. ga-ctpp designs appropriate two-pair primers to genotype a defined snp based on the parameter settings of dejong and spears. parameter settings or the primer design conditions can be changed individually by users based on their requirements. when the input sequence contains multiple snps, the first snp will be taken as the defined snp to design ctpp primer sets. ga-ctpp reports an optimal set of confronting two-pair primers through a text file that records all information of the ctpp primer set for genotyping of the defined snp.

CONCLUSIONS
pcr-ctpp may replace pcr-rflp because the restriction enzyme digestion step can be omitted, resulting in lower costs and shorter genotyping times  <cit> ; however, the pcr-ctpp is less developed for its computational tool providing pcr-ctpp primer design. a novel strategy for pcr-ctpp primer design has been introduced in this paper and the freely available web server implemented with this method was also constructed. with experimental validation, our proposed ga-based method is a useful algorithm to design feasible ctpp primers and it conforms to most of the pcr-ctpp constraints.
