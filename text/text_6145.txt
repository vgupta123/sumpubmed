BACKGROUND
ubiquitination is a key posttranslational modification that is involved in most aspects of cellular homeostasis, signalling and regulation. in ubiquitination, sequential action of e <dig> , e <dig>  and e <dig>  proteins act sequentially to promote attachment of the  <dig> amino-acid polypeptide ubiquitin to a substrate protein <cit> . ubiquitin is attached to the substrate through an isopeptide bond between the c-terminus of ubiquitin and the ε-amino group of a substrate lysine. e <dig> enzymes transfer ubiquitin to the active site cysteine of an e <dig> enzyme  <cit> . e <dig> enzymes, in turn, bind to e <dig> ligases, which contain either hect domains or a member of the structurally similar ring, phd-like and u-box domain superfamily  <cit> . e <dig> ligases also contain other domains that directly or indirectly bind substrate proteins. e <dig> ligases thus bring together ubiquitin-conjugated e <dig> enzymes and particular substrates, and also catalyze ubiquitin transfer to substrate lysines  <cit> . in the absence of substrates, some e <dig> ligases can promote the attachment of ubiquitin to one of their own lysines, in a process termed "autoubiquitination"  <cit> .

ubiquitination can result in the addition of a single ubiquitin  but also in the addition of successive ubiquitins to the first   <cit> . successive ubiquitins are linked through one of the seven ubiquitin surface lysines. modification by a k48-linked polyubiquitin chain targets the substrate for proteasomal degradation, the intracellular fate commonly associated with ubiquitination  <cit> . other polyubiquitin chains and monoubiquitin play roles in trafficking, dna repair, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation and other processes  <cit> .

e <dig> enzymes exhibit high similarity in sequence and structure  <cit> . there are several dozen e <dig> enzymes and hundreds of e <dig> ligases, which carry out ubiquitination in different combinations. as the identity of the e <dig> enzyme recruited by an e <dig> ligase to a particular substrate crucially influences the type and consequences of the ubiquitination, it is important to characterize the structural and biochemical parameters that govern the specificity of e2:e <dig> interactions.

the c-terminus of hsp <dig> interacting protein  is a homodimeric ubiquitin ligase that links chaperone function with the degradation of misfolded or unstable proteins  <cit> . as such, chip plays a key role in protein quality control, serving as a disposal mechanism for conformationally intractable proteins that might otherwise overwhelm the chaperone system. chip binds to c-terminal motifs found in the chaperones hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  chip has three domains: an n-terminal tpr  domain through which it binds hsp <dig> or hsp <dig>  a middle helical domain that mediates chip dimerization  <cit> , and a c-terminal u-box domain that binds specific e <dig> enzymes  <cit> . by recruiting a cognate e <dig> enzyme, chip promotes ubiquitination of numerous labile client proteins that are chaperoned by hsp <dig> or hsp <dig>  <cit> . these clients include proto-oncogene products, kinases, nuclear hormone receptors, and aggregation-prone proteins, such as α-synuclein and tau, that are involved in neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> .

two e <dig> enzymes, ubch <dig> and ubc <dig>  have been identified as cognates for chip  <cit> . "ubch5" refers collectively to three highly homologous e <dig> enzymes, ubch5a, b and c . while the ubch <dig> enzymes were previously thought to carry out k48-linked ubiquitination exclusively, recent studies have shown that they can form mixed-linkage polyubiquitin chains in vitro with several e <dig> ligases, including chip  <cit> . recently, pearl and coworkers showed that chip also interacts with ubc13-uev1a  <cit> , a heterodimeric e <dig> enzyme that exclusively forms k63-linked chains  <cit> . k63-linked chains are primarily associated with trafficking and substrate regulation  rather than degradation  <cit> . the crystal structure of ubc13-uev1a bound to the u-box of chip shows that ubc <dig> interacts with the chip u-box, while neither subunit of the ubc13-uev1a heterodimer contacts the chip-tpr or dimerization domains  <cit> .

interaction between chip and these two different e <dig> enzymes likely results in different types of polyubiquitination and different biological outcomes. as ubch <dig> and ubc <dig> are similar in sequence and structure, it is unclear whether and how chip distinguishes between these e <dig> enzymes. to obtain additional insights into chip specificity, we solved the crystal structure of zebrafish ubch5a bound to the chip u-box domain. despite an overall structural similarity, chip exhibits differences in the details of individual interactions in the ubch5a and ubc13-uev1a complexes, as well as in the ability of the respective enzymes to carry out chip autoubiquitination . the structures of the two complexes allow us to further define a set of specificity determinants required for interaction with chip. based on these determinants, we identify several class iii e <dig> enzymes as an additional, third group of cognate e <dig> enzymes for chip. as the first e <dig> ligase to be structurally characterized in complex with two different e <dig> enzymes, chip may serve as a useful model for understanding the basis of specificity in other e2:e <dig> interactions.

RESULTS
structure of the chip u-box: ubch5a complex
we previously investigated the interaction between chip and ubch5b using nmr and site-directed mutagenesis  <cit> . this allowed us to identify respective binding interfaces on each protein and to propose a model for the chip u-box:ubch5b complex. the model, however, was ambiguous with respect to specific interactions mediated by particular main-chain and side-chain groups, especially those involving the prominent l <dig> and l <dig> loops on the e <dig> enzyme. to obtain a more accurate understanding of how chip binds to members of the ubch <dig> family, we screened full-length human and zebrafish chip, as well as their respective u-box domains, for cocrystallization with human and zebrafish ubch5a, ubch5b and ubch5c. we crystallized a complex of the zebrafish chip u-box and ubch5a and solved its structure to  <dig>  Å resolution by molecular replacement . statistics for the structure solution are listed in table  <dig> 

astatistics for the highest resolution shell are shown in parentheses.

the crystal asymmetric unit contains a back-to-back u-box dimer, with each u-box bound to an ubch5a molecule . the u-box conformation and dimerization mode are essentially identical to those in previously described structures of free chip , emphasizing that the u-box undergoes negligible conformational change upon binding to an e <dig> enzyme. the chip u-box structure is characteristic of the ring/phd-like/u-box fold superfamily  <cit> . it consists of a small β-sheet, a central α-helix  and a c-terminal helix  that participates in u-box dimerization. the u-box also has two prominent loops, chip-l <dig> and chip-l <dig>  which, together with chip-α <dig>  comprise the interaction site for e <dig> enzymes  <cit> .

while several structures of ubch <dig> family e <dig> enzymes have been solved previously  <cit> , this is the first to be solved in complex with an e <dig> ligase domain. ubch5a adopts the characteristic fold exhibited by all e <dig> enzyme catalytic cores, consisting of a central β-sheet flanked by  <dig> helices. the n-terminal α-helix  and two prominent loops, ubch5a-l <dig> and ubch5a-l <dig>  comprise most of one side the protein and interact with the chip u-box , contacting a hydrophobic groove formed by the interface of chip-l <dig>  chip-l <dig> and chip-α <dig>  the interface buries ~ <dig> Å <dig> of solvent-accessible surface area. the overall chip u-box:ubch5a complex resembles the structures of the chip u-box: ubc13-uev1a complex  <cit>  and the complex of the c-cbl ring domain with the e <dig> enzyme ubch <dig>  <cit> .

full-length chip is an asymmetric homodimer, in which the conformation of one monomer is such that its tpr domain occludes the u-box domain of the same monomer; the chip dimer thus contains only one e <dig> binding site  <cit> . we superimposed the u-box:ubch5a complex onto the structure of full-length mouse chip . the model of the chip:ubch <dig> complex reemphasizes that e <dig> interactions with chip are mediated only through the u-box domain, while no contacts are made between the e <dig> and the helical or tpr domains of the chip dimer.

analysis of interface between chip u-box and ubch5a
key interactions between the chip u-box and ubch5a are shown in figure  <dig>  . the interactions are arranged around a central hydrophobic patch, in which the sidechain of ubch5a-f <dig> protrudes into a concave surface formed by aliphatic portions of sidechains from both loops and helix α <dig> of the u-box . the phenyl ring of ubch5a-f <dig> also stacks against the guanidinium group of chip-r <dig>  which is held in position by a salt bridge with chip-e <dig> . these two large sidechains thus form the "back wall" of a primarily hydrophobic dimple in the chip u-box surface, into which ubch5a protrudes. ubch5a-f <dig> is flanked by other aliphatic residues , which contribute to the hydrophobic interaction area. an additional interaction is formed by planar stacking of the aromatic sidechain of chip-f <dig> against the guanidinium group  <cit>  of ubch5a-r <dig>  which leaves the arginine sidechain free to participate in an extensive intra-ubch5a polar network .

the abovementioned interactions are flanked by polar interactions , among which hydrogen bonds between the sidechains of ubch5a-r <dig>  ubch5a-s <dig>  and chip-r <dig> with complementary main chain groups are prominent. several additional interactions, such as the one between ubch5a-k <dig> and the chip-f <dig> carbonyl oxygen, are likely to be weak, as they are present in one of the u-box: ubch5a complexes in the crystal asymmetric unit but not in the other. in addition, there are several charged residues on ubch5-α <dig> and chip-l <dig>  that are near enough to each other to potentially engage in salt bridge interactions. the relevant sidechains, however, exhibit suboptimal interaction geometries or actually point away from their putative partner residues, suggesting that the corresponding salt bridges are weak or disfavoured.

in the absence of hsp70/hsp <dig> and a chaperone-bound client, chip itself is ubiquitinated by ubch <dig> family e <dig> enzymes  <cit> . chip autoubiquitination is an effective reporter of a productive interaction between chip and ubch <dig> enzymes. we previously mutagenized the surface of the chip u-box to identify residues important for its interaction with ubch <dig> family e <dig> enzymes, as gauged by in vitro chip autoubiquitination assays and western blotting with anti-ubiquitin antibody  <cit> . we have now carried out elisa-based assays  in nickel-nta coated microplates to quantitate autoubiquitination of his-tagged human chip by human ubch5b . our results confirm the key importance of the hydrophobic chip residues lining the intersection of the l <dig> and l <dig> loops and helix α <dig>  including chip-i <dig>  h <dig> and v <dig>  as chip is autoubiquitinated poorly or not at all by the corresponding alanine mutants . similarly, flanking interactions mediated by f <dig> and r <dig> are crucial for productive chip:ubch <dig> interactions, as the corresponding alanine mutants also eliminate chip autoubiquitination .

comparison between chip:ubch5a and chip:ubc13-uev1a complexes
many of the interactions shown in figure  <dig> are also conserved in the complex between chip and ubc13-uev1a . superimposition of the ubch5a:chip u-box and ubc13:chip u-box complexes  suggests that the interaction surfaces in the two complexes are similar, though there are several detailed differences that may influence the relative strengths of the interactions. the α <dig> helices of the two e <dig> enzymes are the most divergent in terms of overall structure, but this difference does not translate into large differences in the locations of the chip-interacting residues, such as ubch5a-r5/ubc13-r <dig>  on these helices .

since ubch <dig> and ubc13-uev1a form different types of polyubiquitin chains  <cit> , we investigated whether mutations that prevented autoubiquitination of chip by ubch <dig> have similar effects on ubc13-uev1a. we initially tried to detect autoubiquitination of his-chip by ubc13-uev1a in nickel-nta plates as described above for ubch <dig>  but observed no chip autoubiquitination above background . several previous studies have suggested that chip catalyzes the formation of unanchored k63-linked polyubiquitin chains by ubc13-uev1a, but that these chains are not conjugated to chip itself  <cit> . we reconfirmed this by western blotting of in vitro ubiquitination assays. chip promoted the formation of polyubiquitin chains by ubc13-uev1a, detected using anti-ubiquitin antibody. no higher-molecular weight species indicative of polyubiquitinated chip, however, were detectable by western blotting with anti-chip .

our initial elisa assay selected exclusively for his-tagged chip conjugated to flag-ubiquitin. we therefore carried out a second assay using a mixture of his- and flag-tagged ubiquitins to detect polyubiquitin chains that were not conjugated to chip. our results indeed confirm that chip catalyzes ubc13-uev1a-mediated formation of unanchored, mixed flag- and his-tagged ubiquitin chains that were readily quantified . however, despite the structural similarity between the chip:ubch5a and chip:ubc <dig> interfaces , several mutations that do not catalyze ubiquitination with ubch5b are substantially active with ubc13-uev1a. of the mutants tested, only chip-i235a is inactive with both e <dig> enzymes .

to explore why ubc13-uev1a is less sensitive to many of the mutations that eliminate productive interactions between ubch <dig> and chip, we investigated the two most obvious differences in the chip:ubch5a and chip:ubc <dig> interfaces . first, ubc13-m <dig> is located in the same position as ubch5-f <dig>  second, a salt bridge between ubc13-r <dig> and chip-d <dig> is not conserved in the chip:ubch5a complex; instead, ubch5a-d <dig> is the equivalent of ubc13-r <dig>  we mutagenized these sites to investigate their importance for chip:e <dig> interactions. surprisingly, ubc <dig> is largely insensitive to mutations at the m <dig> position. in contrast, ubch5a does not tolerate a methionine at the f <dig> position . the interaction between r <dig> and chip-d <dig> also contributes to binding between ubc <dig> and chip, as ubc13-r14d is inactive in polyubiquitin chain formation . similarly, the chip-d229a mutant is less active in polyubiquitin chain formation by ubc13-uev1a than any chip mutants other than chip-i235a . in contrast, the d229a mutation has little effect on chip autoubiquitination by ubch5b.

thus, m <dig> is not required to anchor the hydrophobic interface between ubc <dig> and chip, possibly because ubc <dig> has at an additional compensating salt bridge to buttress its interaction with chip. indeed, the hydrophobic interface is less important overall for the ubc13:chip interaction, and the chip-h260a and chip-v264a mutants also exhibited partial activity with ubc13-uev1a. these data suggest that the detailed binding energetics differ between the chip:ubch5a and chip:ubc13-uev1a complexes, in terms of the relative importance of individual interactions for overall binding.

influence of s-p-a motif in e <dig> enzymes on interaction with chip
one of the points of most intimate contacts between chip and ubch5a or ubc13-uev1a is located at the interface of the chip u-box and loop l <dig> of the e <dig> enzymes . on this loop, the motif s-p-a  makes a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of chip-p <dig> and van der waals contacts with chip-h <dig>  v <dig> and v <dig>  as previously noted by pearl and coworkers, the first position within this motif is unlikely to tolerate bulkier sidechains than serine, as these would clash with the surface of the chip u-box  <cit> . previous studies indeed suggest that e <dig> enzymes that do not contain the s-p-a motif are not cognate e <dig> enzymes for chip .

residues on loop  <dig> of selected e <dig> enzymes, corresponding to the positions of the s-p-a motifs in ubch <dig> and ubc <dig> 

*reported in this study.

we examined the sequences of human e <dig> enzymes for those containing s-p-a motifs on loop l <dig>  and with no residues at other positions that would obviously prevent interaction with the chip u-box. several class iii e <dig> enzymes, ube2e <dig>  ube2e <dig> and ube3e <dig>  fulfilled these criteria. class iii e <dig> enzymes, by definition, contain a n-terminal sequences that precede an e <dig> catalytic domain. the ube2e1- <dig> enzymes, which contain 40– <dig> residue n-terminal extensions  <cit> , undergo nuclear translocation after being charged with ubiquitin from e <dig>  <cit> . while their n-terminal regions differ, their catalytic domains are highly homologous . we tested full-length ube2e <dig> as well as its catalytic domain  for polyubiquitin chain formation in the presence of chip by western blotting and by the elisa-based ubiquitination assay . like ubch <dig>  ube2e2cat autoubiquitinates chip. based on the very high homology between the ube2e1- <dig> catalytic domains, it is likely that ube2e <dig> and ube2e <dig> are also cognate e <dig> enzymes for chip.

we used another e <dig> enzyme, ubch <dig>  to investigate whether the s-p-a motif is sufficient for conferring compatibility with chip. ubch <dig> contains a lysine at the position equivalent to the serine of the s-p-a motif. we tested both wild-type ubch <dig> and ubch7-k96s for chip autoubiquitination . surprisingly, neither carried out polyubiquitination with chip, suggesting that the presence of an s-p-a motif in an e <dig> enzyme is necessary but not sufficient for productive interaction with chip.

discussion
understanding the factors governing selectivity between e <dig> enzymes and e <dig> ligases is important for several purposes: 1) identifying or predicting which e2:e <dig> pairs govern a particular ubiquitin-linked pathway; 2) engineering e2:e <dig> pairs that can be used to identify substrates targeted by a particular e2:e <dig> combination; 3) rationalizing the functional diversity that characterizes many intracellular ubiquitination pathways. while there are numerous structures of isolated e <dig> enzymes and e <dig> ligases, there are relatively few structures of e2:e <dig> complexes. the structures of two ring/u-box domains in complex with e <dig> enzymes have been solved previously: the cbl-ring domain with ubch <dig>  <cit>  and the chip u-box domains with ubc13-uev1a  <cit> . in addition, a complex between the cnot <dig> ring domain and ubch5b was modelled based on a comprehensive series of nmr and mutagenesis experiments  <cit> .

we add to the above list the structure of the chip u-box: ubch5a complex. the chip u-box is the first ubiquitin ligase domain to be structurally characterized with two different e <dig> enzymes, shedding additional light on key specificity determinants that govern e2:e <dig> interactions. a number of determinants are conserved among all the structurally characterized e2:e <dig> complexes, partly reflecting sequence homology among the ligase-interacting portions of e <dig> enzymes  <cit> . table  <dig> lists key interactions found in the complexes, grouping those that are located in equivalent positions.

key interactions observed in structures of e2:e <dig> complexes  <cit> . the cnot4:ubch <dig> complex structure was not solved explicitly but modeled based on nmr structures of cnot <dig> and ubch <dig> and on experimental restraints derived from nmr data and mutagenesis  <cit> .

the central hydrophobic interface, formed between aliphatic groups from loops l <dig> and l <dig> of the e <dig> enzyme and a cluster of aliphatic groups from both structured loops and the central helix of the ring/u-box domains, is likely present in all complexes formed between e <dig> enzymes and ring/phd-like/u-box ligases. a ring of primarily hydrophobic residues from the l <dig> and l <dig> loops and the central helix of the ring/u-box ligase domains define the walls of a concavity into which the tip of e2-l <dig> protrudes. these include a hydrophobic residue on loop l <dig>  that is an isoleucine, leucine or valine in essentially all ring/u-box domains.

the conformations of the interacting loops on both partners are strongly influenced by the positions of highly conserved proline residues, which interact directly with the rim of the hydrophobic concavity on the ligase domain. these prolines also help to position other e <dig> residues such as the large hydrophobic sidechain at the tip of loop l <dig> . correspondingly, a highly conserved proline residue on loop l <dig> of the ring/u-box type ligases  helps to position both hydrophobic and polar residues on this loop for interactions with e <dig> enzymes. this proline also directly interacts with the serine and alanine of the e <dig> s-p-a motif  through its mainchain carbonyl group and through hydrophobic contacts respectively. it may be difficult to directly test the importance of these prolines by mutagenesis, as the corresponding mutants are likely to be improperly folded or insoluble in bacterial expression systems .

the central hydrophobic interface is flanked by polar interactions contributed by sidechains from the e2-α <dig> helix and loop l <dig>  a significant number of these determinants involve sidechain-mainchain interactions. interestingly, several stacking interactions between arginine guanidinium groups and aromatic sidechains are present in the chip complexes, and likely play a role in the ubch5:cnot <dig> complex as well. in addition, an arginine on loop l <dig> of the ligase domains  extends to interact with mainchain groups on loop l <dig> of the e <dig> enzymes. overall these flanking interactions are less conserved among the e2:e <dig> interactions of known structure, and likely among e2:e <dig> complexes in general, than the central hydrophobic interaction surface. for example, no aromatic or hydrophobic residues corresponding to chip-f <dig> are present in c-cbl or many other ring/u-box type ligases. aromatic residues appear at this position in only a third of such ligase domains. similarly, the flanking arginine  is conserved in only some u-boxes and ring domains, although there are often other polar residues with long sidechains at this position.

the relative importance of individual interactions in determining the overall affinity differs among e2:e <dig> complexes. for example, the chip-r272a and f237a mutants promote polyubiquitin formation by ubc <dig> but do not interact productively with ubch <dig> . similarly, ubc <dig> retains its interaction with chip even when m <dig>  the hydrophobic residue on loop ubc13-l <dig> that points into the hydrophobic pocket of the chip u-box, is mutated to alanine. this residue is a tyrosine or phenylalanine in approximately half of e <dig> enzymes, and hydrophobic in another 25%, but polar in the remaining e <dig> enzymes. this residue is somewhat less conserved than is the hydrophobic character of its binding pocket on the ring/u-box domain surface. this suggests that several other residues, such as the conserved prolines on e2-l <dig> and l <dig>  can provide enough hydrophobic interaction area to support some e2:e <dig> interactions, depending on whether other supporting interactions are present.

chip binds 3- to 5-fold more strongly to uncharged ubc <dig> than ubch5a in isothermal titration calorimetric measurements, although both affinities are in the micromolar range . this suggests that the total binding energies are similar in the two complexes but are distributed differently among individual interactions in the binding interfaces. for example, a salt bridge is present between ubc13-α <dig> and chip-l <dig> that has no counterpart in the ubch5:chip complex . the relative insensitivity of ubc13-uev1a to single mutations in the chip hydrophobic interface may also reflect the slightly higher affinity of this e2:e <dig> complex. it remains to be seen whether the affinity of chip for the ubiquitin-loaded forms of ubc <dig> and ubch <dig> are similar. we will also be investigating whether we can disrupt ubc13:chip interactions by combining two ubc <dig> mutations that, by themselves, do not disrupt interaction with chip.

a preponderance of hydrophobic and sidechain-mainchain interactions, rather than sidechain-sidechain interactions, promotes the close apposition of the interacting surfaces in the chip:ubch5a and chip:ubc <dig> complexes. this highlights the role that the avoidance of steric clashes may play in e2:e <dig> interaction selectivity. the s-p-a motif, which appears to be required for interaction with the chip u-box, provides an example of both negative steric selectivity and positive interaction selectivity, since the serine side chain forms a key hydrogen bond with a mainchain proline carbonyl group from the u-box. substitution of the serine with an alanine, as in ubc <dig>  prevents the e <dig> enzyme from productively interacting with chip  <cit> . other e <dig> enzymes that have bulky residues at positions equivalent to the s-p-a motif are also unable to interact with chip .

in the cbl:ubch <dig> complex, a lysine residue replaces the serine, and the local conformations of the ubch7-l <dig> and cbl-l <dig> loops are different than those in the ubch5a:chip complex, contributing to different polar interactions and accommodating the larger lysine side chain  <cit> . the n-terminal helix and loops l <dig> and l <dig> have slightly different conformations in ubch <dig> than their counterparts in ubch5a and ubc <dig>  possibly preventing them from orienting the relevant groups correctly to partner with the chip u-box. for example, the key e2-α <dig> arginine residue  interacts with a different loop l <dig> mainchain carbonyl in the cbl:ubch <dig> and cnot4:ubch5b complexes than in the chip complexes . an inability to form this hydrogen bond may be the reason why the ubch7-k96s mutant did not interact productively with chip . superimposition of ubch <dig> onto the ubch5a:chip u-box structure also suggests that ubch7-r <dig>  the equivalent of ubch5a-r <dig>  would clash with chip-f <dig>  while cbl has an alanine residue at the position corresponding to chip-f <dig> . interestingly, cbl has been shown to interact with both ubch <dig> and ubch <dig>  <cit> . in addition, cbl engages e <dig> enzymes not only through the ring domain but also through a secondary binding site between a helical region and the n-terminal helix of the e <dig> enzymes  <cit> . this may compensate for the absence of an interaction equivalent to the ubch5a-r5: chip-f <dig> interaction.

the number and similarity of some of the specificity determinants among the known e2:e <dig> complexes suggests that many e <dig> ligases interact with more than one type of e <dig> enzyme. this has several potential functional consequences. one possibility is that an e <dig> ligase interacts with different e <dig> enzymes in different intracellular contexts. we found that chip interacts in vitro with a representative class iii e <dig> enzyme, ube2e <dig>  ube2e <dig> and its close homologues ube2e <dig> and ube2e <dig> undergo nuclear import after they are charged with ubiquitin  <cit> . chip is partially localized to the nucleus  <cit> , suggesting that chip may be a partner for these class iii e <dig> enzymes in the ubiquitination of nuclearly localized substrates.

another rationale for the ability of an e <dig> ligase to interact with multiple e <dig> enzymes is specific to ubc <dig>  ubc <dig> is the only e <dig> enzyme that exclusively synthesizes k63-linked polyubiquitin chains, in a manner dependent on its heterodimerization with a uev  protein, such as uev1a, uev1b or mms <dig>  <cit> . uevs have an e2-like fold but lack a catalytic cysteine. instead, they bind ubiquitin noncovalently and position k <dig> of the noncovalently bound ubiquitin for conjugation to the thioester-linked ubiquitin on ubc <dig>  thus forming k63-linked polyubiquitin  <cit> . ubc13/uev heterodimers may be unable to directly ubiquitinate some substrates, instead forming free k63-linked chains  <cit> . accumulating evidence, however, suggests that ubc13/uev heterodimers may also bind to a substrate-conjugated ubiquitin moiety through the uev subunit  <cit> . this could allow ubc <dig> to attach additional ubiquitins to the initial ubiquitin, forming a substrate-conjugated k63-linked chain. ubc13/uev heterodimers may thus rely on other e <dig> enzymes, which must be compatible with the e <dig> ligase participating in the ubiquitination reaction, to "preubiquitinate" a given substrate. ubc13-uev1a and ubc13-mms <dig> participate in distinct intracellular processes with different intracellular localization  <cit> . intracellular localization may further limit which preubiquitinating e <dig> enzymes are available. if the preubiquitinating e <dig> enzyme is itself capable of polyubiquitination, the relative affinities of the preubiquitinating e <dig> enzyme and ubc <dig> for the e <dig> ligase may also regulate the type of polyubiquitin chain that is added to the substrate, as both e <dig> enzymes may compete for binding to the e <dig> ligase.

CONCLUSIONS
in this article, we describe the structural basis for the interaction of the u-box of chip with its cognate e <dig> enzyme ubch5a. binding of chip to ubch5a and ubc <dig> enzymes is mediated by a similar set of interacting groups, which resemble those observed in other structurally characterized ring:e <dig> enzyme complexes. the chip:ubch5a complex forms through close packing of complementary hydrophobic surfaces, surrounded by polar interactions. the s-p-a motif, located on loop l <dig> of ubch5a and ubc <dig> acts as an important specificity determinant; e <dig> enzymes lacking this motif are not cognate enzymes for chip. based on the conservation of the s-p-a motif, the class iii e <dig> enzyme ube2e <dig> and its homologues ube2e <dig> and ube2e <dig> are also cognate e <dig> enzymes for chip. chip may have to interact sequentially other e <dig> enzymes and ubc13-uev1a in order to attach k63-linked polyubiquitin chains on substrates, as chip only stimulates the formation of free k63-polyubiquitin by ubc13-uev1a. this provides one functional rationale for the ability of chip and other e <dig> ligases to interact with multiple e <dig> enzymes.
