BACKGROUND
aquaculture has the potential to make a significant contribution to the increasing demand for aquatic food in most world regions; however, in order to achieve this goal, the sector will have to face significant challenges, including the production intensification, the disease control and the prevention of the environmental deterioration
 <cit> . in fish farming, the widespread use of antibiotics as prophylactic and therapeutic agents to control bacterial diseases has been associated with the emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens and with the alteration of the microbiota of the aquaculture environment
 <cit> . this resulted in the ban of antibiotic usage as animal growth promoters in europe and stringent worldwide regulations on therapeutical antibiotic applications. this scenario has led to an evergrowing interest in the search and development of alternative strategies for disease control, within the frame of good husbandry practices, including adequate hygiene conditions, vaccination programmes and the use of probiotics, prebiotics and immunostimulants
 <cit> . recently, novel strategies to control bacterial infections in aquaculture have emerged, such as specific killing of pathogenic bacteria by bacteriophages, growth inhibition of pathogen by short-chain fatty acids and polyhydroxyalkanoates, and interference with the regulation of virulence genes , which have been reviewed by defoirdt et al. <cit> . with regard to probiotics, they are defined as live microbial adjuncts which have a beneficial effect on the host by:  modifying the host-associated or ambient microbial community;  improving feed use or enhancing its nutritional value;  enhancing the host response towards disease; and/or  improving its environment
 <cit> . to date, most probiotics proposed as biocontrollers and bioremediation agents for aquaculture belong to the lab group , to the genera vibrio, bacillus, and pseudomonas or to the species saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> . recently, a probiotic culture  has been authorized for the first time for use in aquaculture in the european union.

according to the fao/who
 <cit> , the development of commercial probiotics requires their unequivocal taxonomic identification, as well as their in vitro and in vivo functional characterization and safety assessment. in europe, the european food safety agency  proposed a system for a pre-market safety assessment of selected groups of microorganisms used in food/feed and the production of food/feed additives leading to a qualified presumption of safety  status
 <cit> . the qps approach propose that the safety assessment of a defined taxonomic group could be made based on establishing taxonomic identity, body of knowledge, possible pathogenicity and commercial end use. according to the efsa approach
 <cit> , most lab species are included in the qps list and, therefore, demonstration of their safety only requires confirmation of the absence of determinants of resistance to antibiotics of human and veterinary clinical significance. however, in the case of enterococci, a more thorough, strain-specific evaluation is required to assess the risk associated to their intentional use in the food chain. in this work, we present the antimicrobial activity against fish pathogens and the in vitro safety assessment beyond the qps approach of a collection of  <dig> lab belonging to the genera enterococcus, lactobacillus, lactococcus, leuconostoc, pediococcus and weissella, previously isolated from aquatic animals regarded as human food
 <cit>  and intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture.

RESULTS
direct antimicrobial activity of the  <dig> lab of aquatic origin
the  <dig> lab strains isolated from fish, seafood and fish products displayed direct antimicrobial activity against, at least, four of the eight tested indicator microorganisms . the most sensitive indicators were listonella anguillarum cect <dig>  ls. anguillarum cect <dig> and aeromonas hydrophila cect <dig>  followed by lactococcus garvieae jip29- <dig>  streptococcus iniae lmg <dig> and streptococcus agalactiae cf <dig>  on the contrary, photobacterium damselae cect <dig> and vibrio alginolyticus cect <dig> were the less sensitive indicator microorganisms.

adirect antimicrobial activity was determined by a soat and the scores reflect different degrees of growth inhibition ; -, no inhibition; +, 3– <dig> mm inhibition zone; ++, 6– <dig> mm inhibition zone; +++, ≥ <dig> mm inhibition zone.

preliminary safety evaluation of enterococci: presence of virulence factors, production of gelatinase and hemolysin and antibiotic susceptibility
concerning e. faecalis, most of the strains  harboured, at least, one relevant virulence factor: efaafs , gele , or agg  genes . a positive gelatinase reaction was found in  <dig> e. faecalis strains  which harboured gele, from which  <dig> also harboured agg gene. only one e. faecalis strain  , harbouring cylll-cylls-cylm, exerted hemolytic activity, while none of the strains amplified hyl or esp genes. with regard to e. faecium,  <dig> strains  harboured, at least, one relevant virulence factor: efaafs , gele  or agg , but only  <dig> strains  exerted gelatinase activity. none of the e. faecium strains exerted hemolytic activity nor amplified hyl or esp genes. the results of the antibiotic susceptibility tests revealed that  <dig> enterococccal strains  displayed acquired antibiotic resistance to antibiotics other than penicillin g, chloramphenicol and high-level gentamicin. in this respect,  <dig> e. faecalis strains  showed acquired resistance to  second generation quinolones  ,  rifampicin ,  nitrofurantoin ,  glycopeptides  , and/or  erythromycin . however,  <dig> e. faecium strains , including  <dig> strains that encode virulence factors and nine strains without these traits, displayed acquired resistance to  erythromycin ,  nitrofurantoin ,  second generation quinolones  ,  rifampicin ,  tetracycline , and/or  glycopeptides  . moreover, multiple antibiotic resistance  was found in e. faecalis  and, to a lesser extent, in e. faecium  . according to the results above,  <dig> e. faecalis strains were discarded for further studies based on the presence of virulence factors , acquired antibiotic resistance  or both . regarding e. faecium strains,  <dig>  were dropped from further screening based on acquired antibiotic resistance , the presence of virulence factors  or both .

extracellular antimicrobial activity of the  <dig> pre-selected lab
the antimicrobial activity of supernatants from the  <dig> pre-selected lab  with direct antimicrobial activity against fish pathogens was assayed against three indicator microorganisms by an adt . in this regard,  <dig>  and  <dig>  strains displayed extracellular antimicrobial activity in their supernatants and/or 20-fold concentrated supernatants against pediococcus damnosus cect <dig> and l. garvieae jip 29– <dig>  respectively, but none of the strains inhibited the gram-negative strain a. hydrophila cect <dig>  interestingly, the antimicrobial activity of the respective supernatants was sensitive to proteinase k treatment, but was not affected by the heat treatment, revealing the proteinaceous nature and heat stability of the secreted antimicrobial compounds . the  <dig> lab strains secreting bacteriocins into the liquid growth medium belong to the species p. pentosaceus , e. faecium , and lb. curvatus .

blb. carnosus, l. cremoris, lc. cremoris and w. cibaria strains did not show extracellular antimicrobial activity against any of the tested indicator microorganisms.

in vitro safety assessment of the  <dig> pre-selected lab
the  <dig> pre-selected lab were further submitted to a comprehensive safety assessment by different in vitro tests.

hemolysin production, bile salts deconjugation and mucin degradation
none of the non-enterococcal strains showed hemolytic activity, similarly as found for the  <dig> enterococci. moreover, bile salts deconjugation and mucin degradation abilities were not found in any of the tested strains.

enzymatic activities
the results of the analysis of enzymatic activity profiles of the tested lab are shown in table
 <dig>  none of the strains showed lipolytic activity, except e. faecium lpp <dig>  tpm <dig>  sma <dig>  and smf <dig> which produced esterase  and esterase lipase . moreover, none of the lab strains showed protease activity . nevertheless, peptidase activity  was found in all the species. all strains showed acid phosphatase  and naphthol-as-bi-phosphohydrolase activities, but none displayed alkaline phosphatase activity. β-galactosidase was found in most species  except lb. curvatus and l. cremoris. however, α-glucosidase was only found in the three lc. cremoris strains. β-glucosidase and n-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase activities were observed in most e. faecium, lactobacillus spp., l. cremoris, and p. pentosaceus strains, but only in two w. cibaria strains, while the three lc. cremoris strains showed β-glucosidase but lacked n-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase activity. on the other hand, α-galactosidase, β-glucuronidase, α-mannosidase, and α-fucosidase activities were not detected in any of the tested lab strains.

antibiotic susceptibility determined by the broth microdilution test
the distribution of mics of the tested antibiotics is summarized in tables
 <dig> and
 <dig>  microbiological breakpoints for ampicillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol reported by the feedap document on the assessment of bacterial products used as feed additives in relation to antibiotic resistance
 <cit>  were used to categorise the  <dig> lab as susceptible or resistant strains. in this document, the genus weissella, which is considered a group of heterofermentative leuconostoc-like lab
 <cit> , is not included. for this reason, the respective mics were interpreted by using the breakpoints given for the genus leuconostoc. besides, due to the lack of microbiological breakpoints for penicillin and linezolid on the feedap document, we interpreted our results on these antibiotics according to the cut-off levels proposed by klare et al. <cit>  for pediococci, namely  <dig> and  <dig> mg/l for penicillin and linezolid, respectively. according to our results, the percentages of strains showing antibiotic resistance in the genera weissella, pediococcus, lactobacillus and enterococcus were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 11%, respectively, while none of the leuconostocs and lactococci showed this phenotype. in summary,  <dig> % of the  <dig> non-enterococal strains resulted susceptible to ampicillin, 100% to gentamicin,  <dig> % to kanamycin, 100% to streptomycin, 95% to erythromycin,  <dig> % to clindamycin, 95% to tetracycline, and 100% to chloramphenicol. for vancomycin, it is known that facultative and obligate heterofermentative lactobacillus, pediococcus spp. and leuconostoc spp. are intrinsically resistant. in contrast, the three lactococci were clearly susceptible to these antibiotics, showing a mic of  <dig>  mg/l. on the other hand, according to the cut-off values proposed by klare et al. <cit> , 93% of p. pentosaceus strains were susceptible to penicillin and linezolid. with regard to e. faecium, all the tested strains were susceptible to ampicillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin except e. faecium bnm <dig> against the latter antibiotic . moreover, multiple antibiotic resistance  was only detected in p. pentosaceus lpm <dig>  and w. cibaria sma <dig> .

amics determined by a vetmic test. the antibiotic dilution ranges were:  <dig> - <dig> mg/l , 1- <dig> mg/l , 2- <dig> mg/l , 16- <dig> mg/l , 8- <dig> mg/l ,  <dig> - <dig> mg/l ,  <dig> - <dig> mg/l  and  <dig> - <dig> . mics which exceeded the upper or lower limit of the tested range are listed in the next dilution series. mics higher than the efsa breakpoints are indicated in bold.

detection of antibiotic resistance genes
the non-enterococcal strains showing antibiotic resistances in the vetmic assays  were further submitted to pcr in order to identify the presence of the respective antibiotic resistance genes. the tested strains were the following: lb. carnosus b <dig> , p. pentosaceus tpp <dig> and smf <dig> , p. pentosaceus lpp <dig>  lpm <dig> and b <dig> , p. pentosaceus lpv <dig> and w. cibaria p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  sdm <dig>  sdm <dig>  sma <dig> and bcs <dig> , and p. pentosaceus lpm <dig> and w. cibaria sma <dig> . acquired antibiotic resistances likely due to added genes were only found in strains within the genera pediococcus  and weissella . the genes involved in the horizontal transfer of resistance to tetracycline , kanamycin  and erythromycin  were not detected. however, p. pentosaceus lpm <dig> and w. cibaria sma <dig> harboured the erythromycin resistance gene mef. the obtained amplicons were sequenced and found to have 99% homology with the macrolide-efflux protein  gene described for streptococcus pneumoniae and other streptococcus spp. moreover, p. pentosaceus lpm <dig> and lpm <dig> harboured the lnu gene encoding the lincosamide o-nucleotidyltransferase that inactivates lincomycin and clindamycin. sequencing of both amplicons showed 97% and 93% homology with lincosamide nucleotidyltransferase  gene described for staphylococcus haemolyticus and s. aureus, respectively. nevertheless, lnu was not detected in any of the tested strains. with regard to e. faecium bnm <dig>  which was phenotypically resistant to erythromycin, none of the respective genes  were detected.

discussion
in this work, the antimicrobial activity against fish pathogens and the in vitro safety of  <dig> lab previously isolated from fish, seafood and fish products
 <cit>  have been assayed by using microbiological, biochemical and genetic assays in order to identify and select the most suitable candidates to be further evaluated as probiotics for a sustainable aquaculture. lab are widely known for their ability to inhibit bacterial pathogens by the production of antimicrobial compounds such as organic acids, oxygen peroxide and ribosomally-synthesized peptides referred to as bacteriocins, which constitutes a desirable property for probiotics and a sustainable alternative to antibiotics
 <cit> . in this respect, most of the lab of aquatic origin tested in this work displayed a broad antimicrobial spectrum against the main gram-positive and gram-negative fish pathogens, being remarkable that a high number of strains  were identified as potential bacteriocin producers. recently, bacteriocin production ability has been proposed as a key property for selection of probiotic lab to be used in aquaculture as an alternative to antibiotics to fight against fish pathogen infections
 <cit> , similarly as proposed for human and farm animal probiotics
 <cit> . in aquaculture farming, lactococcosis produced by the zoonotic agent l. garvieae, causing hemorrhagic septicaemia and meningoencephalitis, is one of the most serious diseases affecting several marine and fresh water fish species
 <cit> . with regard to this, our work shows that putative bacteriocinogenic lab active against this relevant fish pathogen are common amongst the microbiota isolated from aquatic animals .

the application of probiotics in aquaculture may modify the microbial ecology of the aquatic hosts and their surrounding environment, and thus the assessment of their safety to the target aquatic species, the environment and humans constitutes an essential issue
 <cit> . to date, several studies describing the screening and evaluation of lab as probiotic candidates for aquaculture have been reported
 <cit> ; however, the safety assessment of the strains is generally limited to in vivo challenge tests and rearing trials in order to confirm their lack of toxicity to the aquatic hosts
 <cit> . strikingly, in vitro safety assessment studies have not been generally addressed, despite they have lower economic and ethic costs and result very effective to evaluate the safety of a high number of candidate probiotic strains not only for the host species, but also for humans and the environment. according to efsa
 <cit> , most of the lab species tested in this work  are included in the qps list and, therefore, demonstration of their safety only requires confirmation of the absence of determinants of resistance to antibiotics of human and veterinary clinical significance. however, in the case of enterococci, a more thorough, strain-specific evaluation is required to assess the risk associated to their intentional use in the food chain, while no guidelines are given for the safety assessment of the species w. cibaria <cit> .

our results show that enterococcal virulence factors were more frequently found in e. faecalis than in e. faecium, which is in concordance with previous reports
 <cit> . in this respect, most of the e. faecalis  and a large percentage of the e. faecium  strains evaluated in this work showed, at least, one virulence factor, being efaafs, gele and agg the most frequently detected genes. with regard to gele, which encodes for an extracellular zinc endopeptidase that hydrolyzes gelatin, collagen, hemoglobin, and other bioactive compounds, this gene was detected at high frequency in e. faecalis, with all the gele+ strains showing gelatinase activity. however, five out of nine e. faecium strains harbouring gele were unable to degrade gelatin, suggesting the carriage of a non-functional gene, as previously reported
 <cit> . likewise, in the case of e. faecium p <dig> and e. faecium gm <dig> harbouring cylllcylls, the lack of hemolytic activity may be explained by the absence of cylm, whose product is involved in the post-translational modification of cytolysin. on the other hand, esp and hyl, which encode a cell wall-associated protein involved in immune evasion and an hyaluronidase enzyme, respectively, were not found in any of the tested lab. previous studies have reported that esp and hyl are more common in ampicillin-resistant/vancomycin-resistant e. faecium  than in ampicillin-susceptible/vref strains
 <cit> . in this context, the increase in the incidence of vref at hospital settings has been attributed mainly to the spread of ampicillin-resistant vref exhibiting esp and/or hyl <cit> . therefore, the fact that the e. faecium strains evaluated in this work lack these genes might be related with their non-clinical origin and absence of ampicillin resistance.

the use and frequent overuse of antibiotics, including those used in human medicine, in fish farming has resulted in the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the aquaculture environment. this possesses a threat to human and animal health due to the increase of acquired antibiotic resistance in fish pathogens, the transfer of their genetic determinants to bacteria of terrestrial animals and to human pathogens, and the alterations of the bacterial microbiota of the aquatic environment
 <cit> . in our study, the percentage of enterococcal strains showing acquired antibiotic resistance was 68%. interestingly, the results found in e. faecium  and e. faecalis  were similar, however, higher percentages of resistance to ciprofloxacin and/or norfloxacin, rifampicin, and glycopeptides were observed in e. faecalis. nevertheless, the occurrence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance was frequently detected amongst e. faecium  but only in one e. faecalis strain . in spite of the high prevalence of acquired antibiotic resistance found in enterococci of aquatic origin, they showed low incidence or absence of resistance to the clinically relevant antibiotics vancomycin  and ampicillin, penicillin and gentamicin, respectively, which is in agreement with previous studies
 <cit> . moreover, the percentages of strains showing antibiotic resistance in the genera weissella, pediococcus and lactobacillus were  <dig>   <dig> and 33%, respectively, while none of the leuconostocs and lactococci showed this phenotype. in this regard, our results indicate that the lab susceptibility patterns of mic values to clinically relevant antibiotics are species-dependent, similarly as previously described by other authors
 <cit> . moreover, multiple antibiotic resistance was commonly found in strains within the genus enterococcus , mainly in e. faecalis, while being very infrequent in the non-enterococcal strains .

according to efsa
 <cit> , the determination of mics above the established breakpoint levels, for one or more antibiotic, requires further investigation to make the distinction between added genes  or to the mutation of indigenous genes. according to our results, acquired antibiotic resistance likely due to added genes is not a common feature amongst the non-enterococcal lab of aquatic origin . in this respect, this genotype was only found in the genera pediococcus  and weissella . although p. pentosaceus lpv <dig> and lpm <dig> showed resistance to kanamycin , the respective resistance gene aac-ie-aph-ia was not found in these strains. similarly, p. pentosaceus tpp <dig> and smf <dig> were phenotypically resistant to tetracycline , but did not contain tet, tet or tet. in this respect, ammor et al. <cit>  reported that pediococci are intrinsically resistant to the latter two antibiotics, as well as to glycopeptides , streptomycin, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. other authors proposed a mic for tetracycline in pediococci ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> mg/l
 <cit> , or of  <dig> mg/l for oxytetracycline in p. pentosaceus <cit> . the tetracycline breakpoints suggested for pediococci by efsa are lower than the mics observed in our work and others
 <cit> . on the other hand, the only antibiotic resistance detected in leuconostoc strains was for vancomycin, which is an intrinsic property of this genus. it has been previously reported that leuconostoc strains display poor, if any, resistance to antibiotics of clinical interest
 <cit> . with regard to lactococci, the three l. cremoris strains evaluated were susceptible to all the antibiotics; however, relatively high mics for rifampicin  and trimethoprim  were detected. in fact, most lactococcal species are resistant to trimethoprim
 <cit> . as expected, all strains of heterofermentative lactobacillus spp. were resistant to vancomycin but susceptible to the rest of the assayed antibiotics, except lb. carnosus b <dig>  which showed the highest mic for ampicillin and penicillin . in this context, the presence of modifications in the low affinity penicillin-binding protein  that confers resistance to penicillin and β-lactams in e. faecium and streptococcus pneumoniae, has been reported
 <cit> . moreover, nine pbps have been described in lb. casei atcc 393
 <cit> , which leads us to suggest that a similar mechanism may be also responsible for the ampicillin and penicillin resistance found in lb. carnosus b <dig>  the resistance to vancomycin detected in pediococcus, leuconostoc and lactobacillus species in this study might be due to the presence of d-ala-d-lactate in their peptidoglycan rather than d-ala-d-ala dipeptide
 <cit> . in this context, all tested w. cibaria strains showed mics ≥  <dig> mg/l for vancomycin, suggesting that vancomycin resistance is an intrinsic property of this species. in relation to weissella spp., studies on antibiotic resistance profiles are very limited
 <cit>  and breakpoints have not been defined by efsa
 <cit> . in our study, most w. cibaria strains showed low mic values; however w. cibaria bcs <dig> showed relatively high mics for penicillin  and kanamycin , and w. cibaria sma <dig> showed mics of  <dig> mg/l for kanamycin,  <dig> mg/l for gentamicin, erythromycin and neomycin, and  <dig> mg/l for clindamycin. therefore, these two strains were discarded of this study, while w. cibaria p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  sma <dig>  sdm <dig> and sdm <dig> were not included in the final selection due to their mics for kanamycin . according to these results, as a rule of thumb, we propose for w. cibaria the breakpoints assigned to leuconostoc spp. by efsa
 <cit> , until further studies establish the wild-type mic ranges within this species. in spite of that, different mics for rifampicin and trimethoprim for w. cibaria and lc. cremoris were found in this study. the reduced susceptibility of w. cibaria towards trimethoprim could indicate an intrinsic resistance to this antibiotic
 <cit> . in our work, the only antibiotic resistance genes found were mef, which encodes a drug efflux pump conferring a low to moderate level of resistance to  <dig> - and  <dig> -membered macrolides but not to lincosamide or streptogramin b antibiotics
 <cit> , and lnu, encoding the lincosamide o-nucleotidyltransferase that inactivates lincomycin and clindamycin
 <cit> . in this respect, p. pentosaceus lpm <dig> and w. cibaria sma <dig>  displaying erythromycin resistance , carried the gene mef, which can be found in a variety of gram-positive bacteria, including corynebacteria, enterococci, micrococci, and several streptococcal species
 <cit> . on the other hand, two pediococci  that showed resistance to clindamycin  carried the gene lnu, which had been only previously found in staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci and lactobacilli of animal origin and in staphylococci isolated from humans
 <cit> . strikingly, the clindamycin resistant strains p. pentosaceus lpp <dig> and b <dig> and w. cibaria sma <dig>  did not harbour this gene nor lnu. to our knowledge, this is the first description of mef in the genera pediococcus and weissella, and lnu in the genus pediococcus. the detection of resistance genes for macrolide and lincosamide in non-enterococcal strains suggests a wider distribution of this group of genes than previously anticipated.

the in vitro subtractive screening proposed in this work also include the assessment of bile salts deconjugation, mucin degradation, biogenic amine production and other potentially detrimental enzymatic activities such as the β-glucuronidase activity, which should be absent in probiotic candidates
 <cit> . excessive deconjugation of bile salts may be unfavourable in animal production since unconjugated bile acids are less efficient than their conjugated counterparts in the emulsification of dietary lipids. in addition, the formation of micelles, lipid digestion and absorption of fatty acids and monoglycerides could be impaired by deconjugated bile salts
 <cit> . similarly, excessive degradation of mucin may be harmful as it may facilitate the translocation of bacteria to extraintestinal tissues
 <cit> . in this respect, it is worthy to note that none of the  <dig> tested lab deconjugated bile salts nor exhibited mucinolytic activity, the latter indicating their low invasive and toxigenic potential at the mucosal barrier. these results are in accordance with previous findings showing that lab do not degrade mucin in vitro <cit> . moreover, β-glucuronidase activity has been associated with the generation of potential carcinogenic metabolites
 <cit> ; however, none of the lab tested in our study displayed this harmful enzymatic activity. in a previous work
 <cit> , we demonstrated that none of the  <dig> non-enterococcal strains evaluated herein produced histamine, tyramine or putrescine. with regard to enterococci, the nine e. faecium strains only produced tyramine, being e. faecium cv <dig> a low producer of this biogenic amine. although the lack of biogenic amine production by probiotic strains is a desirable trait, it should be borne in mind that tyramine production by enterococci is a very frequent trait
 <cit> . finally, several studies have suggested that probiotic microorganisms might exert a beneficial effect in the digestion process of fish due to the production of extracellular enzymes
 <cit> . in our work, the lab strains of aquatic origin within the genera pediococcus, enterococcus and lactobacillus showed a higher number of enzymatic activities than lactococcus, leuconostoc and weissella, being the enzymatic profiles similar amongst strains within the same genus. in this respect, nearly all the strains produced phosphatases, which might be involved in nutrient absorption
 <cit> , and peptidases and glucosidases that breakdown peptides and carbohydrates, respectively. however, the tested lab showed weak lipolytic activity and no proteolytic activity.

CONCLUSIONS
this work shows that antimicrobial/bacteriocin activity against fish pathogens is a widespread probiotic property amongst lab isolated from aquatic animals regarded as human food. however, particular safety concerns based on antibiotic resistances and virulence factors were dominant within e. faecalis  and e. faecium , and acquired antibiotic resistance genes were not commonly found  amongst the non-enterococcal isolates of aquatic origin. to our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study describing the antimicrobial activity against fish pathogens and the safety assessment beyond the qps approach of lab isolated from aquatic animals. the in vitro subtractive screening presented herein, which allowed the selection of  <dig> strains  out of  <dig> lab isolates of aquatic origin, constitutes a valuable strategy for the large-scale preliminary selection of putatively safe lab intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture and to avoid the spreading of bacterial cultures with harmful traits into the aquatic environment. nevertheless, a comprehensive in vivo assessment of their lack of toxicity and undesirable effects must be also carried out using cell lines, live food and, ultimately, aquatic animals before their unequivocal consideration as safe probiotics for a sustainable aquaculture.
