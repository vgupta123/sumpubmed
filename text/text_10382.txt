BACKGROUND
cotton is an important natural resource used in the textile industry. it is a highly pure natural cellulosic material, comprising approximately 90% cellulose that is organized into strong microfiber structures. pectin is a major non-cellulosic impurity present in the cuticle and primary cell wall of cotton. it acts as a cementing material for the cellulosic network and as a hydrating agent that controls the movement of water and plant fluids  <cit> , providing firmness and rigidity to the cotton fibers. the backbone of pectin is made of α- <dig> -linked d-galacturonic acid residues, in which the carboxylic groups of galacturonic acid are largely esterified with methoxy groups, while the hydroxyl groups on the backbone can be partially acetylated. xylose, galactose and arabinose are present as side chain sugars of pectin  <cit> . the hydrophobic nature of pectin is responsible for the non-wetting behavior of the native cotton, which creates difficulty for fabric dyeing in textile processing  <cit> .

conventionally, pectin and other waxy substances in cotton fabrics are removed by boiling alkali treatment in a process known as scouring. this process makes the fabric more hydrophilic and more accessible for subsequent textile processing. the scouring process carries an environmental burden owing to the large consumption of sodium hydroxide and water . in addition, scouring also causes non-specific degradation of cellulose, which decreases the tensile strength of fibers, and consequently leads to lower fabric quality  <cit> . in contrast to the harsh conditions employed in the conventional scouring process, enzymatic processing  can be performed under mild reaction conditions using individual or combinations of different enzymes including lipases, proteases, cellulases and pectinases . among them, pectinases are the most promising  <cit> . pectinases release waxes and other non-cellulosic components of the cotton fibers with minimal non-specific damage to the cellulosic structure. pectinase penetrates the cuticle layer of cotton fiber through cracks or micropores and then partially breaks down pectin in the primary wall matrix  <cit> . the breakdown of pectin loosens linkages between the cuticle and the cellulose body leading to increased absorbency of the fabric.

according to the mode of action and substrate preference, pectinases are classified into two groups, namely  pectin esterases  and  pectin depolymerases, which are further divided into polygalacturonases  and lyases   <cit> . polygalacturonases usually work optimally under an acidic range and require no co-factors for their catalysis. conversely, lyases require divalent metal co-factors and are optimally active under alkaline conditions  <cit> . crude pectinase preparations isolated from fungi, for example aspergillus spp. and penicillium spp. that have been tested for potential as bioscouring agents of cotton textiles, possess strong pectate lyase activity. this enzyme works optimally under alkaline conditions, which is compatible with the production of peroxide in the subsequent bleaching step  <cit>  while there has been no report on application of purified or recombinant pectate lyases or polygalacturonases in bio-scouring. in addition to bioscouring, enzymatic starch removal  using amylases prior to the bioscouring step has been shown to have potential for reducing operating time and energy consumption in textile processing  <cit> . combined desizing and bioscouring treatment using amylases and pectinases is hindered by the very different optimal ph of these enzymes. searching for acidic pectinase working on bioscouring under acidic conditions optimal is thus challenging.

in this study, we aimed to express a recombinant acidic endo-polygalacturonase from a. aculeatus in methylotrophic yeast p. pastoris using high cell density fermentation. the recombinant enzyme was evaluated in eco-friendly textile processing in comparison to the conventional alkaline scouring process. the developed biscouring process has demonstrated for the first time the action of polygalacturonase on textile scouring with advantages on improved physical properties of the fabrics and allows further optimization of the one-step desizing-scouring for textile processing.

high cell density fermentation
the recombinant p. pastoris expressing endopg was cultivated in high cell density fed-batch fermentation in a 5-l bioreactor  with the method modified from charoenrat et al.   <cit> . briefly, the primary inoculum was prepared by inoculating a colony of the recombinant p. pastoris into a 125 ml flask containing 20 ml of ypd broth and incubated at 30 °c with rotary shaking at 250 rpm for 24 h before subcultivating 20 ml of the inoculum into 180 ml fm <dig> medium. the fm <dig> medium contained: kh2po <dig>   <dig>  g/l; caso <dig>   <dig>  g/l; k2so <dig>   <dig>  g/l; mgso4 · 7h2o,  <dig>  g/l; 2so <dig>   <dig>  g/l; glycerol,  <dig>  g/l; histidine,  <dig>  g/l and ptm <dig>   <dig>  ml/l. the trace salt  contained: cuso4 · 5h2o,  <dig>  g/l; ki,  <dig>  g/l; mnso4 · h2o,  <dig>  g/l; na2moo4 · 2h2o,  <dig>  g/l; h3bo <dig>   <dig>  g/l; zncl <dig>   <dig>  g/l; fecl <dig>   <dig>  g/l; cocl2 · 6h2o,  <dig>  g/l; h2so <dig>   <dig>  ml/l; and biotin,  <dig>  g/l. the culture was further incubated at 30 °c with rotary shaking at 250 rpm for 48 h. a 5-l bioreactor vessel containing  <dig>  l basal salt medium  phosphoric acid 85%,  <dig> %  caso <dig>   <dig> %  mgso <dig> h2o,  <dig> %  koh, 4%  glycerol) was inoculated with 200 ml of the secondary inoculum. the fermentation parameters were controlled at 30 °c, 500–700 rpm agitation, 30% dissolved oxygen , with  <dig> vvm aeration, and ph  <dig> , adjusted using nh4oh. the fed-batch cultivation was divided into four stages: glycerol batch stage, glycerol fed-batch stage, methanol induction stage, and production stage as described previously by jahic et al.  <cit> . the batch culture was grown until the glycerol was exhausted and the fed-batch mode was applied by constant glycerol feeding at  <dig>  ml/h/l of initial fermentation volume for 4 h. the methanol induction feed was started after 3–5 h to avoid repression of aox promoter  <cit> . then, 100% methanol feed was added continuously into the fermentation culture, starting at a rate of  <dig>  ml/h/l fermentation volume for the first 2 h and gradually increasing by 10% increments every 1 h to a target rate of  <dig>  ml/h/l fermentation volume, which was maintained during the fermentation process. the pectinase activity, dry-cell weight, and protein concentration of the fermenter culture were monitored throughout the cultivation.

biochemical characterization and kinetic study of endopg
effects of ph and temperature on the endopg activity and stability were studied in order to determine the enzyme’s optimal working conditions . the recombinant enzyme demonstrated optimal ph and temperature of  <dig>   and 50 °c , respectively. it retained more than 60% of its initial activity after incubation at 40 °c for 180 min . however, the enzyme rapidly lost activity at 50 °c and 60 °c. the ph stability test showed that more than 80% of enzyme activity was retained after incubation in ph  <dig>  to  <dig>  for 24 h . a marked decrease in enzyme activity was observed at ph  <dig>  to  <dig> .fig.  <dig> effects of  ph and  temperature on endopg activity. the highest activity under the optimal condition  was considered as 100% relative activity. data points are the mean values and error bars represent standard deviations from triplicate experiments

high cell-density fermentation
production of endopg was further studied using high cell-density fermentation approach in a laboratory-scale fermenter. the fed-batch fermentation process comprised three steps including glycerol batch, transition or glycerol fed-batch, and methanol induction or production phases . the inoculum was prepared in synthetic fm <dig> medium in order to increase cell density and enzyme production. the glycerol batch stage was carried out for the first 30 h. at the end of glycerol batch stage, the dry cell weight reached 23 g/l. subsequently, the glycerol fed-batch stage was initiated using constant feeding at the rate of  <dig>  ml/h/l of the initial fermentation volume for 4 h. during the glycerol fed-batch stage, the cell dry-weight increased almost two fold from  <dig> to  <dig> gcdw/l. the endopg activity reached the highest level of  <dig>  u/ml in the induction stage  with the specific production yield of  <dig> . <dig> u/g biomass. the high cell density fermenter thus resulted in  <dig>  times greater enzyme production yield compared with the shake-flask culture.fig.  <dig> high density fermentation profile of endopg production in p. pastoris. the cultivation condition during the production stage was maintained at 30 °c and ph  <dig> 




bioscouring by endopg
the performance of endopg on bioscouring of cotton fabric was tested based on weight loss and wettability assay . enzymatic treatment of the fabric with endopg led to a marked improvement on water absorbency of the fabric samples compared with the control of no enzyme treatment. the control fabric showed low water absorbency with a wettability time greater than 3 min. increasing enzyme dosage led to increased fabric wettability  and corresponding increased weight loss of fabric. maximum water absorbency of  <dig>  s was observed at the highest enzyme dosage, which was comparable to that measured for fabric scoured by alkali treatment; however, with a lower weight loss of the textile. in addition, the fabrics treated with endopg showed a greater tensile strength for both the weft yarn  and warp yarn  compared with that obtained using chemical scouring . the results clearly indicated potential and advantages of the bioscouring process using endopg as a promising alternative to the conventional alkaline scouring method. similar results on weight loss, wettability and tensile compared to those obtained using buffer alone were observed using the heat-inactivated enzyme .table  <dig> comparison of weight loss and wettability of the fabrics scoured by enzyme  and alkali treatment 





discussion
heterologous expression of composite enzymes attacking pectin including polygalacturonases, pectate lyases, and pectin esterases from various ascomycetes and basidiomycetes fungi has been reported in yeasts . p. pastoris is considered an efficient expression system owning to its high production yield of heterologous proteins in secreted forms, allowing cost competitive enzyme production with minimal downstream processing  <cit> . recombinant endo-polygalacturonases from a. niger, bispora sp., phytophthora parasitica and penicillium sp. produced in p. pastoris expression system have been reported with varying biochemical characteristics . a. aculeatus is a promising producer of multi-component starch and cell wall degrading enzymes with potent application in various biotechnological processes  <cit> . in this study, an endopg from a. aculeatus atcc <dig> was expressed as a major protein in the culture supernatant with >90% homogeneity, allowing production of the enzyme with no need for subsequent downstream purification. the enzyme showed a specific activity of  <dig> u/mg total protein  which is comparable to the equivalent recombinant enzyme from a. niger  <cit> . the optimal activity of the enzyme at 50 °c was relatively higher than that of the commercial acid fungal polygalacturonase, which works optimally at 40 °c  <cit> .

production of endopg by high cell density fermentation was achieved yielding maximal activity of  <dig> u/ml. the greater yield of enzyme from fermentation compared with batch cultivation is due to the higher cell density achievable in the former, as shown by od <dig> of  <dig> , equivalent to a cell concentration of  <dig>  g/l at the exponential glycerol feeding stage before induction by methanol. the benefit of improved yield of enzyme using high cell density fermentation has also been reported for other types of recombinant enzymes expressed in p. pastoris e.g., xylanase and cellulase  <cit> . to our knowledge, our work represents the first report on heterologous expression and high cell density fermentation of polygalacturonase in p. pastoris with the highest production yield,  <dig> . <dig> u/g biomass, resulting in the higher enzyme productivity compared to that obtained using batch cultivation using wild type or recombinant microorganisms .

bioscouring of cotton fabrics using pectinases has been shown as an interesting approach for reducing chemical and energy consumption in textile processing. compared to conventional chemical scouring using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide and soaps at high temperature, the bioscouring alternative can result in complete replacement of the scouring chemicals and as the enzymatic process is performed under lower temperature, which leads to substantial saving of cost for energy and waste water treatment  <cit> . although endopg showed the optimal temperature at 50 °c, the bioscouring process was carried out at 40 °c at which the enzyme showed high catalytic activity with high operational stability . the lower operating temperature in the scouring step also has advantage on a lower energy cost. crude pectinases from various bacterial and fungal origins have been used for bioscouring of cottons and other types of textiles e.g., linen and ramie  <cit> . the use of purified or recombinant composite pectinases on bioscouring has not been previously reported. the recombinant pectinase reported here was shown to be capable of enzymatic bioscouring with a maximal water adsorbancy of  <dig>  s, which is in the accepted range for industrial processing . however, application of either crude enzymes rich in polygalacturonase or pectate lyase activity alone has been reported to show incomplete scouring on the fabric in some cases  <cit> . pectate lyases catalyze trans-elimination of a- <dig> -glycosidic linkage in pectic acid and form products with  <dig> -unsaturated residues at the non-reducing end. these structural changes increase more polar functional groups and hence the hydrophilicity on the surface of cotton fibers, which could be an important factor for the improved water absorption and dyeability of the treated fabrics. the results thus suggest further formulation of the endopg with pectate lyases or other composite pectinolytic enzymes as well as other enzymes e.g., cellulases and cutinases  <cit>  to improve its performance. the endopg catalyzed process resulted in fabrics with higher tensile strength compared with the chemical scouring method. this reflected the higher specificity of the enzyme on attacking the polygalacturonic acid backbone of pectin with no decomposition of the cellulose fibers, which is an undesirable side activity of alkali in chemical scouring  <cit> . this resulted in fabrics with higher strength with lower weight loss from the enzymatic process.

CONCLUSIONS
the applicability of a recombinant cellulase-free polygalacturonase  on bioscouring has been demonstrated. the enzyme can be produced efficiently by high-cell density fermentation in the p. pastoris system and showed its potential on completely replacing the use of toxic scouring chemical with substantial energy saving. the endopg characterized in this study represents a promising alternative for efficient bioscouring towards establishment of an eco-friendly textile processing industry.
