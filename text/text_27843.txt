BACKGROUND
the study of natural allelic diversity has proved fruitful in understanding the genetic basis of complex traits  <cit> . however, exploiting it successfully through association genetics requires basic knowledge of the extent of allelic variation within a species. one of the most interesting ways to achieve this goal consists of developing high-density diversity maps like the those developed in human and chicken, which allow the identification of causal polymorphisms for important traits  <cit> . the recent publication of the first high quality draft of the grapevine genome sequence opens the way to building such a diversity map  <cit> . like in animals or in other perennial plant species where genetic approaches based on the study of segregating populations are hampered by a long biological cycle, association genetics is of particular interest in grapevine.

the development of diversity map relies on the discovery of sequence polymorphisms in the genome in a small set of genotypes that are as representative as possible of available genetic diversity. such a concept was first proposed by frankel and brown under the name of core collection  <cit> . core collections can be built using different types of markers. for example, molecular markers were used for rice, wheat and potato, while for yam a core collection was built using the origin of cultivars, eating quality, tuber shape, tuber flesh colour, and morphotype  <cit> . different strategies have been proposed to assist the construction of core collections including the m-method developed by schoen and brown and implemented in the software mstrat  <cit> . this strategy has been successfully used for the construction of core collections in arabidopsis thaliana and medicago truncatula and was also proposed as a preliminary step in association genetics  <cit> .

large collections of genetic resources are available for grapevine especially in europe  <cit> . the largest one is held by inra in france at the domain of vassal: this collection contains  <dig> accessions of vitis genus of worldwide origin  <cit> . the genotyping of the whole collection using  <dig> well-scattered ssr markers is complete laucou et al. . the cultivated compartment  is represented by  <dig> accessions corresponding to  <dig> unique genotypes , from  <dig> different countries. it represents about a half of the known grapevine cultivars  <cit> . the vassal collection was highly diverse for v. vinifera l. subsp. sativa, exhibiting a total of  <dig> alleles for the  <dig> ssrs markers with an average of  <dig>  ssr alleles per locus . moreover a large proportion of these alleles  were present at very low frequency .

a first core collection  in grape was recently developed based on  <dig> morphological traits on  <dig> accessions from the vassal collection  <cit> . it was used for a preliminary study of the extent of linkage disequilibrium  in v. vinifera l. as well as for association studies  <cit> . however, the size of the m-core  limits its use for the analysis of wide sequence diversity.

here we present the use of the data set obtained by laucou et al.  to develop four nested genetic core collections  suitable for the search for allelic diversity. the ability of retaining the ssr genetic diversity using different sample sizes was studied and compared to the ssr diversity present in the m-core and in the vassal collection. finally, the allelic diversity captured at the sequence level in the different sub-cores was analysed by sequencing three gene fragments. this work provides the foundation required for the development of a detailed map of haplotypic diversity in grapevine.

RESULTS
construction of nested core collections representing the available germplasm diversity of cultivated v. vinifera l
we first determined the optimal size of a core collection by retaining the  <dig> alleles showing a frequency above  <dig> %. forty-eight cultivars were necessary to capture 100% of the  <dig> alleles . within this core collection of  <dig> cultivars , we then determined the two most diverse samples of  <dig>  and  <dig>  cultivars . in order to assess the robustness of these nested core collections, we calculated the percentage of identical varieties among the g- <dig>  g- <dig> and g- <dig> core collections obtained in the second run using the same process, which corresponded to  <dig> %  of the varieties selected in the two g- <dig> to  <dig> %  of the varieties selected in the two g- <dig> and to  <dig> %  of the varieties selected in the two g- <dig>  among these two sets of samples, the g- <dig> core collection presenting the highest nei's index was chosen as the reference core collection .

the g- <dig> core was used as a core to build the final core collection retaining the  <dig> alleles found in the cultivated compartment of vitis vinifera l. represented in the vassal collection by laucou et al. . the optimal size of this final core collection was  <dig> individuals . the cultivars added at this step contained only rare alleles , which corresponded to less choice for the selection of varieties. indeed, only two alternative samples were proposed by mstrat, with only one individual differing between the two samples: rich baba rose faux versus kizil. again, we selected the g- <dig> presenting the highest value for the nei's index as the reference core collection for the cultivated compartment of v. vinifera l; the resulting final core collection is listed in table  <dig> 

in order to estimate the gain of ssr allelic diversity, we compared the number of alleles captured in samples obtained by the m-method and by random sampling. in each case, when using the m-method, we observed a gain , the greatest of which being obtained for the selection of the g- <dig> 

analysis of the diversity retained in the nested core collections using different descriptors
the reference nested core collections for the cultivated compartment of vitis vinifera were described for several characteristics and compared to the vassal collection and to the m-core collection  defined by barnaud et al.  <cit> .

ssr diversity
the nested core collections represented 58% to 100% of the total ssr diversity of the vassal collection and 70% to 100% of the restricted ssr diversity of the vassal collection  . all the ssr alleles with a frequency of more than 5% within the vassal collection are present in the g- <dig> core and all those with a frequency of more than  <dig> % within the vassal collection are present in the g- <dig>  the values of the unbiased nei's diversity index and the level of unbiased observed heterozygosity for the g- <dig> core, g- <dig> core and g- <dig> core collection were quite similar and slightly higher than those calculated for the g- <dig> core collection. these values were slightly higher than those of the vassal collection and of the m-core . we also compared allele frequencies of the ssr markers in the three g-cores and in the m-core with the frequencies observed in the vassal collection: the best correlation was obtained between the vassal collection and the m-core  and the g- <dig>  core collections .

geographic origin and final uses
the definition of the true geographical origin of grapevine cultivars is sometimes difficult due to many migration events with humans  <cit> . based on current knowledge, the cultivars held in the vassal collection originated from  <dig> countries, with about half of them from western europe . the cultivars selected in the nested core collection originated from  <dig> different countries . however  <dig> varieties of the g- <dig> sample could not be assigned to a precise geographical origin. among them,  <dig> varieties were recent crosses between varieties from different countries  and one have an unknown origin . moscatel de oeiras faux microsatellite data seemed to indicate a western europe origin when compared to the whole collection. the origins of the  <dig> remaining varieties were well distributed :  <dig>  came from the caspian region  and the middle east  which corresponds to the center of domestication, and  <dig>  came from western europe and north africa  . interestingly, five varieties  originated from central asia and asia despite their very limited representation in the whole collection .

no differences were observed between the m-core  and the vassal collection  whereas all the g-cores differed from the vassal collection. indeed the number of cultivars from western europe and the center of domestication were more balanced in the g- <dig> core with a very good representation of the whole set of geographic origins. the same trend was observed in the different sub-cores .

we also compared the g- <dig> core collection, the m-core and the vassal collection with respect to the final use of the cultivars: wine making , fruit consumption  or both . the m-core and the different g-cores all resembled the vassal collection .

evaluation of the capture of unlinked diversity in the nested core collections
next, we assessed the ability of the nested g-core samples to capture diversity unlinked to the ssr markers used to build the nested core collection. barnaud et al. estimated using  <dig> ssr markers mapped on five different linkage groups  with a maximum distance of  <dig> cm that ld in grape extends only within lg and is around  <dig>  cm maximum  <cit> . we analysed the polymorphism of three gene fragments mapped further than  <dig>  cm from the ssr markers in the same linkage group. dfr mapped in lg  <dig>   <dig>  cm from the ssr marker vvin16; l-dox mapped in lg  <dig>   <dig> cm from the ssr marker vmc1b <dig> and burp mapped in lg  <dig>   <dig> cm from the ssr marker vvmd <dig> 

forty-one nucleotide polymorphisms  were observed in the g- <dig>  ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> depending on the gene fragment . the total polymorphism is thus one snp for  <dig> nucleotides. the number of snps per base also varied between the three gene fragments: one snp for every  <dig> nucleotides for dfr, one snp for every  <dig> nucleotides for l-dox and one snp for every  <dig> nucleotides for burp. the difference of genetic diversity between coding and non coding region of the sequences was estimated only for the dfr sequence which has a quite similar length of the two types of regions. for this gene the polymorphism was different between coding and non-coding regions with a ratio of  <dig>  . considering all genes together, the number of snps detected increased from  <dig> to  <dig> between the g- <dig> and the g- <dig> cores and from  <dig> to  <dig> between the g- <dig> and the g- <dig> cores. only one more snp was discovered in the g- <dig> core than in the g- <dig> core for the l-dox gene fragment . the higher number of snps in the g- <dig> than in the g- <dig> cores was due to two genotypes: yapincack with three additional snps in the dfr gene fragment and kisilowy with one additional snp in the l-dox gene fragment.

estimation of the ability to capture unlinked diversity of the g- <dig> core and g- <dig> core was performed by comparing their snp diversity with snp diversity in five random samples of  <dig> individuals in the g- <dig> core and  <dig> individuals in the g- <dig> core. the number of snps in the different random samples varied from  <dig> to  <dig> snps for the five random samples of  <dig> individuals and from  <dig> to  <dig> snp for the five random samples of  <dig> individuals. in order to compare snp distribution, we also calculated the unbiased nei's index, which varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the five random samples of  <dig> individuals and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the five random samples of  <dig> individuals. the unbiased nei's index of the g- <dig> and g- <dig> cores was respectively  <dig>  and  <dig> .

estimating the unlinked diversity within the whole vassal collection  would have been very fastidious. consequently we compared the capture of unlinked diversity in the nested core collections and in the m-core developed only on morphological traits. the total number of snps in the m-core  was smaller than in any of the nested g-core samples, even the g- <dig> core . moreover, none of the snps observed in the m-core was new compared to those found in the nested core collections.

discussion
in the present work, we developed a set of nested core collections from the cultivated compartment of the vassal collection, using the m-method and ssr diversity data obtained on  <dig> unique genotypes. however, in this way we did not take into account the somatic variants present within v. vinifera l. cultivated germplasm. the usefulness of core collections is due to their ability to capture the diversity of the whole species. even the smallest nested core collections were more efficient in capturing allelic diversity than the m-core with its  <dig> accessions. the vassal collection, which formed the basis of this work, includes around  <dig> cultivars which correspond to  <dig> unique ssr genotypes from  <dig> countries, including from the main domestication area. this represents more than half the varieties found world wide  <cit> . a core collection developed from vassal collection is thus of major interest for the scientific community, and thanks to the vegetative propagation ability of grape, could be easily multiplied and distributed.

construction of the core collections
the first result of our work is the fact that only a small number of cultivars  are needed to represent the whole diversity and an even smaller number of cultivars are needed to capture all the most frequent alleles . the comparison with other models is not easy, as they have different biological characteristics, the original collection did not reach the same global diversity of the species, and the analyses are seldom performed in the same way. nevertheless, the core collections developed for a. thaliana  or m. truncatula  using the same method required higher percentages of individuals selected to represent all the genetic diversity  <cit> . in our study we only considered the cultivated compartment which tends to be less diverse than wild compartments  <cit> . but the high level of heterozygosity of the grapevine is probably also one of the factors that allow a lower number of individuals than homozygous species like the two plant species mentioned above. finally, the small number of individuals needed to represent the genetic diversity of the cultivated grapevine also pinpointed the high redundancy of the vassal collection where many kingroups were highlighted and the interest in using such core collections to optimize the study of the phenotypic and genetic diversity in grapevine  <cit> .

nested core collections are of great interest for identifying the sequence diversity that exists in the cultivated compartment of the v. vinifera species
the total genetic diversity revealed in the sequences of three gene fragments  in the g- <dig> core was quite high with  <dig> snps, i.e. one snp for every  <dig> nucleotides. this is substantially higher than the level of genetic diversity observed in the m-core on the same gene set. moreover, it is higher that the level of genetic diversity observed on an other set of  <dig> gene fragments totalling  <dig> kilobases sequenced on seven cultivated individuals  by salmaso et al. and on a set of  <dig> gene fragments, what represents the analysis of over  <dig> mb of grape dna sequence  <dig> grape genotypes  by lijavetzky et al.  <cit> . this comparison thus emphasises the interest of such a core collection for the discovery of genetic diversity.

among cultivated species, polymorphism in grape is relatively high compared to zea mays , pinus pinaster  and hordeum vulgare , while it is relatively low compared to wild species such as a. thaliana   <cit> .

g- <dig> core is highly diverse and non-redundant
the g- <dig> core was built taking into account extremely rare alleles. considering the rapid evolution of ssr markers, we assumed that the alleles present in two cultivars or less in the collection did not adequately represent gene diversity and they were thus removed when we built the g- <dig> core  <cit> . indeed, only one additional snp was revealed in the g- <dig> sample  compared to the g- <dig>  thus validating our assumption. on one hand, the gain in the unlinked diversity was high in the g- <dig>  probably due to the decrease in redundancy compared to the vassal collection . on the other hand, when compared to a random sampling, the gain was much higher using the m-method. the final g- <dig> core is highly non-redundant and highly diverse. moreover the g- <dig> core optimized the unlinked diversity in the three different regions sequenced compared to the m-core, whose individuals coming from vassal collection were not selected based on their genotypes, by consequent they could be consider as a less optimized sampling within the vassal collection.

the g- <dig> and g- <dig> cores already include respectively 78% and 88% of the snps markers present in the g- <dig> core . they also include 58% and 73% of all the ssrs markers identified within the vassal collection, representing a gain of 6% to 8% compared to random sampling from the g- <dig> or g- <dig> core. from a technical point of view, the size of the g- <dig> and g- <dig> cores is better suited for high throughput genomic studies and consequently highly suitable for ambitious projects of snp discovery.

geographic origin and final uses of the varieties within the g-core
interestingly the nested core collections constructed in the present work reflect the distribution of grapes in europe and around the mediterranean sea but with over-representation of the cultivars originating from the caspian region and middle east, and under-representation of the cultivars from western europe  compared to the vassal collection. we compared the ssr allele frequencies of the nested core collections and of the vassal collection and found low correlations. this result further emphasizes the decrease in redundancy in the core collections compared with the vassal collection, but also reflected the relative high number of cultivars originating from western europe in the vassal collection, whereas the main domestication center is the middle east  <cit> . these two regions may thus represent important sources of genetic diversity for the v. vinifera l. species. they represent the cradle of viticulture and the first migration of cultivars by greeks and etruscans, and a second domestication center in western mediterranean region  <cit> . finally, despite their low representation in the vassal collection, the presence of cultivars from asia and central asia in the nested core collections could also indicate an underexploited center of diversification worthy of prospection and analysis.

the proportion of table varieties, wine varieties and table/wine varieties was very well conserved in the nested core collections compared to the m-core and to the vassal collection. the distinction between these three categories of cultivars is based on morphological traits such as berry size, bunch size and compacity but also on other traits such as the sugar/acid balance at maturity  <cit> . previous studies have shown that there is strong genetic differentiation between these three groups of varieties that may be due either to divergent selection based on the same gene pool or to the use of specific gene pools for the development of the three types of varieties  <cit> .

as a consequence, if the samples are well suited for analysis of allelic diversity, other uses can also be proposed for the cores, for example, the nested core collection could help understand the evolution of grape. both g- <dig> and g- <dig> cores contained more frequent alleles representing ancient alleles while g- <dig> and g- <dig> may constitute subsequent diversification of cultivars in recent periods.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present work, we developed a set of robust nested core collections of v. vinifera l.  that will facilitate the discovery of allelic diversity by the scientific community. moreover, this is an important basic tool for the development of projects of association mapping in grapevine. in conclusion, even if these nested core collections are statistically too small to study correlations between phenotype and nucleotide diversity, their use for preliminary tests of hypothesis will speed up the selection of suitable candidates  and for snp discovery. due to the perennial nature of grape and the ease of vegetative propagation, these nested core collections could easily be disseminated worldwide for analyses .
