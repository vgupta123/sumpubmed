BACKGROUND
single nucleotide polymorphisms , one of the most abundant types of sequence polymorphisms in the genome, are the most suitable markers for genetic linkage mapping, fine-mapping and haplotype reconstruction. over the past decade, snps have been the marker of choice due to their high stability, density and the highly automated way in which snps are detected and snp assays are performed. however only a limited number of snps have been identified in the pig, a species of considerable economical and medical importance. a few thousand snps in the pig are currently available, and these were mainly identified in expressed genes by either in vitro techniques  <cit>  or by mining porcine expressed sequence tag  sequence databases  <cit> . in humans, the large-scale identification and characterization of snps has attracted much more attention, and consequently over  <dig> million snps  have been identified  <cit> ,  <dig>  million of which have been genotyped snps  <cit>  and the snp density is estimated as one snp per 1000â€“ <dig> bases  <cit> . genome scans with high snp densities have proven to be an effective tool in whole genome association studies to identify genes involved in complex genetic traits  <cit> . the snp density in pigs is about four-fold higher than that in humans with snps found at, on average, every  <dig> to  <dig> bps  <cit> . despite the availability of the most highly continuous bacterial artificial chromosome  map of any mammalian genome  <cit>  and the ongoing sequencing efforts in the pig  <cit> , no large scale snp mining on pig genome sequences has been published. the lack of a pig genome draft assembly still hampers the traditional method of identifying snps, in which dna shotgun sequences of different individuals are aligned to a genomic region of interest using alignment algorithms  <cit> . in these alignments, sequences are easily compared and snp candidates can be reliably detected by computational methods like polyphred  <cit> , which has been extensively tested for human snp discovery  <cit> . despite the unavailability of a draft sequence of the pig genome, a wealth of high quality sequence and mapping data is publicly available that can be used for snp detection purposes.

here we describe a high throughput genome sequence mining pipeline from data of the ongoing pig genome sequencing project. with this approach, we performed a snp mining analysis on the whole genome shotgun dataset generated by the danish-chinese pig genome sequencing initiative  <cit>  that is publicly available in the ncbi trace archive. bac sequence data and the bac mapping information to the porcine physical map  <cit>  were combined and we used this as a crude assembly of a reference genome sequence. the pipeline is built from existing public software packages and implemented on a computer cluster, which enables efficient mining of large sequence data sets in parallel.

the encouraging outcome of this study is a good starting point for the development of a rapidly growing genome-wide set of snp markers in the pig.

RESULTS
clustering
at completion of this analysis, the number of finished and contigs of unfinished porcine bac sequences was  <dig> and  <dig> , resulting in  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig>  total nucleotides, respectively. the ncbi trace repository contained  <dig> , <dig> whole genome shotgun sequences for center sdjvp, with a total of  <dig> , <dig>  nucleotides.

because the analysis of the complete data set for the whole genome was computationally too demanding, the identification of snps was performed by a 2-step process. first, the shotgun sequences were assigned to a fingerprint contig by clustering based on their sequence similarity to bac and bac-end sequences. the results of the clustering by alignment were stored in a relational database. the bac and the bac-end naming as well as the mapping data provided the necessary information to assign the obtained sequence clusters to a specific fingerprint contig on the porcine physical bac map. clustering of the shotgun reads with bac or bac-end sequences is outlined in figure 1a. this approach enabled the chromosomal assignment of the sequences, even for chromosomes and chromosomal regions for which currently no assembled chromosome sequence is available at the pre-ensemble  <cit>  website. in total,  <dig>  shotgun sequences were clustered and assigned to a specific fingerprint contig  and  <dig> % of these shotgun sequences mapped to a single unique fpc.

identifying candidate snps
in the second step, the actual identification of snps was performed per fingerprint contig. in this respect, a fingerprint contig can be considered a 'genomic region of interest', which is the starting point in traditional snp mining in species for which a genome draft is available. per fingerprint contig, the relational database was queried for shotgun reads, in which repetitive sequences were tagged, and were aligned using phredphrap  <cit> . finally, the alignments were searched for snps using polyphred  <cit>  as outlined in figure 1b. identified snps were categorised by the number  of sequences that represent identical nucleotide substitution on the snp position in the sequence alignment. snp prediction results of all fingerprint contigs were combined and analysed for redundancy. redundancy was expected, because a small fraction  of the shotgun reads did not uniquely map to a single fingerprint contig. paralogous and repetitive sequences typically cause ambiguous clustering results. although the initial clustering of shotgun sequences was refined in the alignment procedure by phrap  <cit> , a small number of snps still mapped to two distinct genomic regions. these ambiguous snps were removed from the data, resulting in a final list of  <dig>  unique snps . the number of identified snps was drastically reduced when the constraint for the number of sequences representing identical nucleotide substitution in a snp was increased. when this number was raised above two, the majority of predicted snps were located within a genomic context that was tagged as repetitive sequence.

distribution of snps over the pig genome
at completion of this analysis , the sequencing of the pig genome was ongoing and most assembled bac contig sequences were available for chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> the number of snps as a percentage of total number of identified snps per analysed chromosome is provided in table  <dig> 

to evaluate if the snps distribute equally throughout the pig chromosomes the exact locations of unique snps predicted on chromosome  <dig> , <dig>  were determined by alignment. a total of  <dig> snps that mapped uniquely were plotted along these chromosomes as shown in figure  <dig> 

analysis of base changes
the snps in the subsets of candidate snps in which identical nucleotide substitution is represented in one, two, three or four sequences in the alignment were categorized according to nucleotide substitutions: c/t or g/a  and c/g, a/g, c/a, t/g . for each category, we calculated the relative nucleotide substitution frequencies for our snp dataset and for the genomic porcine snps recorded in dbsnp  <cit>  . for the snp subset in which identical nucleotide substitution is represented twice in the alignment, we observed a very similar relative increase in the proportion of transitions over transversions compared to the snps in dbsnp  <cit> .

snps in common with dbsnp
to estimate whether snps predicted by our method are already present in the public database of dbsnp  <cit> , we compared the two datasets by clustering. in dbsnp  <cit> , we selected genomic snps  with at least  <dig> bases of sequence on each side. these  <dig>  snps were trimmed to have exactly  <dig> bases of flanking sequence and were analyzed for redundant records. the confirmed  <dig>  unique snps were compared to our  <dig>  predicted snps  by clustering. no clusters were formed, indicating that our dataset and dbsnp  <cit>  share no snps in common.

experimental validation of candidate snps
to balance the sequence context and the number of times a polymorphism is represented in the sequence alignment, snps in which a nucleotide substitution was represented at least twice in the sequence alignment were chosen for experimental validation. a total of  <dig> selected candidate snps were validated by genotyping in a panel of three purebred boar lines . a total of  <dig>  genotype analyses were performed providing, in addition to snp prediction validation, insights into allele frequencies that will be valuable information for association mapping and qtl studies. to measure the performance of our analyses, validated snps were included that previously had been used within the european union  pig biodiversity project ii   <cit>  as well as snps described by rohrer et al  <cit>  . also,  <dig> known snps in the igf2-region  and  <dig> snps described in a number of publications  were included.

for all  <dig> snps, the allelic variation was determined in our animal panel. in  <dig> cases, the predicted candidate snps turned out to be monomorphic. smaller fractions of snps are observed to be monomorphic in the pigbiodiv and various literature snp sets. the snps described by rohrer et al  <cit>  and the igf2-region were all polymorphic in our animal panel.

for each predicted candidate snp that appeared to be polymorphic in our panel, minor allele frequencies per boar line and overall average minor allele frequencies were calculated .

discussion
because of their highly automated high-throughput assays, snps are the marker of choice for molecular genetic analysis. snps can be obtained cost effectively by analysing public sequence data sets  <cit> . when sequence trace files are involved at the identification of snps, true polymorphisms can be distinguished from sequencing errors. polymorphisms in which the identified base is doubtful due to a high error probability in the trace file, and therefore the most probable cause of the observed variation, are filtered out  <cit> . the number of sequences in which a polymorphism is represented provides information as to whether a predicted snp represents a true polymorphism. by filtering the observed sequence variation for polymorphisms in which the minor allele is represented at least twice in the sequence alignment, the chance that the predicted snp is caused by sequencing errors is extremely small. because the dataset used in our analysis consisted of shotgun sequences providing a  <dig> Ã— coverage, the sequence redundancy in our dataset is limited. this low genome coverage made it likely to detect true genetic variation already at a low sequence depth. even snps with a single representation in the sequence alignment might represent true nucleotide polymorphism at this low genome coverage. however, the chance that snps with a single representation in the sequence alignment turns out to be monomorphic in a genotyping assay is relatively high. in order to obtain a set of high quality snps, we raised the threshold to a two times representation of a nucleotide substitution in the sequence alignment. a further increase of the representation constraint at this low genome coverage would lead to a snp set in which the majority of genetic variation being detected is located in repetitive sequences. in these repetitive sequences, the degree of periodicity in nucleotide usage is high, making it hard to distinguish true allelic variation from predicted sequence variation caused by paralogous sequences. the over-representation of snps in repetitive sequences can be explained by errors in clustering paralogous repetitive sequences, as wel as by the  <dig>  times higher snp density in periodic dna, which is observed in humans  <cit> .

although sequence quality scores and a redundancy-based approach were used to filter sequencing errors from true nucleotide polymorphisms, a non-random distribution of polymorphisms might occur in a particular dataset. these artefacts become visible when snp statistics are compared to other snp collections in the same species and are comparable to those found in related species. when compared to porcine snps deposited in dbsnp  <cit> , our predicted snps in which a nucleotide substitution is represented at least twice in the sequence alignment show a similar transition/transversion ratio . however, the transition frequency in humans was determined to be  <dig> to approximately 66% in vivo  <cit>  and 60%â€“69% in silico  <cit> , respectively. according to the snp statistics in table  <dig>  it is evident that the transition/transversion ratio is highly biased by the fraction of snps in repetitive sequences in a particular dataset. a similar transition/transversion ratio for porcine snps deposited in dbsnp and our subset of snps, in which nucleotide substitutions are represented at least two times, is more likely explained by coincidence than being representative of the pig genome. the  <dig>  fraction of sequences tagged as being repetitive in our snp subset has likely influenced the transition/transversion ratio. therefore the transition/transversion ratio observed in the total number of predicted snps, single redundancy, is likely more representative for the whole pig genome. this suggests a comparable transition/transversion ratio between humans and pigs, which was expected because of the evolutionary relatedness of these species.

a comparison of our collection of predicted candidate snps to the porcine snps in dbsnp  <cit>  revealed no snps in common, not to our surprise. the average snp density in the  <dig>  gb pig genome is estimated to be one in  <dig> base pairs  <cit> , indicating that only a small fraction of the expected total of tens of millions of snps has been identified in the pig.

not all predicted candidate snps turned out to be polymorphic in the animal panel. this doesn't implicitly mean that this  <dig>  fraction  includes falsely predicted polymorphisms. snps in the pigbiodiv  <cit>  and the snps derived from various literature  that were previously experimentally validated resulted in  fractions of monomorphic snps. these fractions of monomorphic snps observed in this study can be explained by difference in selection of the animal panel on which the snps have been validated and the animal panel we used, as well as the absence of chinese breed genetic background, near absence of meishan and the use of another large white in our panel.

within our breed panel, we observed very low  minor allele frequencies  in predicted candidate snps  and in the igf2-region . for snps in the igf2-region, these low maf are the result of intensive selection on that genomic region, whereas for the predicted candidate snps we did not know what to expect because of the unknown genomic location of these snps. intensive selection also might have caused these very low maf.

CONCLUSIONS
the overall performance of the snps identified by our genome shotgun sequence mining approach is comparable to those available in existing snp repositories. in perspective of the ongoing sequencing of the pig genome, the snp data generated by this approach will provide a growing number of available markers that can be applied for genotyping and will increase the snp marker density on the pig genome.
