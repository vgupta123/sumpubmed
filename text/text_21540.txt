BACKGROUND
anabaena  are filamentous, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria that often form blooms in eutrophic water bodies. traditionally, they have been studied as models of multicellular development in bacteria  <cit> . their ability to fix both carbon and nitrogen makes them a key part of the biogeochemical cycle. further, they can produce a range of bioactive secondary metabolites, which have been shown to threaten public health whenever toxic blooms occur in drinking or recreational water bodies  <cit> .

anatoxin-a is one of the most toxic secondary metabolites produced by anabaena species  <cit> . it acts as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist in animals, paralyzing muscles and causing death by asphyxiation  <cit> . the toxin is synthesized via a polyketide synthase  pathway encoded by a cluster of at least eight genes  <cit> . anatoxin-a is known to be synthesized by five genera of cyanobacteria: anabaena , oscillatoria, aphanizomenon, cylindrospermum, and phormidium  <cit> . the entire pks gene cluster has been sequenced and confirmed to produce anatoxin-a or a variant  in anabaena sp. strain  <dig>  oscillatoria sp. strain pcc  <dig>  and cylindrospermum stagnale pcc  <dig> . we describe the isolation of a novel anatoxin-a-producing anabaena from anderson lake, washington state, usa, anabaena sp. wa <dig> 

many cyanobacterial genomes remain in draft form . cyanobacteria genomes are often resistant to standard assembly approaches when using illumina short-insert dna libraries, due to the fact that they have a large percentage of mobile elements  that repeat throughout the genome  <cit> . these repeats, and other types of repetitive dna, are nearly identical in sequence and longer than the insert size of typical dna sequencing libraries. this causes ambiguous alignment and scaffolding of contigs on either side of the repeat and fragments the genome assembly  <cit> . while most of the gene content of these genomes properly assembles, reads from mobile element regions usually do not and are omitted from analysis. structural variation in the genome, such as large deletions or tandem duplications, is also obscured in unfinished genome assemblies. until recently, the only methods that have spanned repeat regions and produced finished nostocaceae genomes have been sanger sequencing and hybrid assembly of  <dig> and illumina sequencing libraries that require laborious extra finishing steps. increasing access to long-read sequencing platforms will circumvent these problems and help to close complex bacterial genomes in a single assembly step  <cit> .

we describe a pacbio sequencing dataset of  <dig>  kbp average read length that was used to finish and close the genome of anabaena sp. wa <dig>  we compare the long-read sequencing results to genome assembly from short-read sequences and describe structural features of potential physiological relevance that are missed by short-read sequencing. we also compare the complete genome of the cultured isolate  to the population genome of the dominant anatoxin-a-producing anabaena in anderson lake .

RESULTS
the anabaena sp. wa <dig> culture and genome
anabaena sp. wa <dig> was isolated from a water sample collected during a cyanobacterial bloom in anderson lake in jefferson county, washington, usa on may 20th,  <dig> . anatoxin-a levels in the lake were  <dig>  μg/l. the non-axenic culture was first established in bg- <dig> medium, then a single contiguous colony - assumed to be clonal - was isolated from the established culture and serially propagated in bg- <dig>  colonies from the culture are heterocystous due to lack of nitrogen in the medium and have mean vegetative cell dimensions of  <dig>  by  <dig> μm . lc-ms/ms analysis showed that the culture produced anatoxin-a, with no detectable homoanatoxin-a nor dihydroanatoxin-a .

dna extracted in december  <dig>  was used to construct a library of size-selected fragments  sequenced on four pacbio smrt cells. a total of  <dig>  gbp with an average read length of  <dig>  kbp was sequenced . two contigs representing the  <dig>  mbp chromosome and a  <dig>  kbp plasmid that make up the complete anabaena sp. wa <dig> genome were de novo assembled from the output of two pacbio smrt cells . at an average nucleotide coverage of  <dig> x, the average phred quality score for the genome is  <dig>  .

the average gc content of the anabaena sp. wa <dig> chromosome is  <dig>  %. there are  <dig> predicted genes on the chromosome, including  <dig> protein-coding sequences ,  <dig> pseudogenes,  <dig> ribosomal rna operons, and  <dig> trna genes . dnaa boxes and a surrounding at-rich region identify a single putative origin of replication from nucleotides 1457– <dig>  the genome has an unusual gc skew pattern  that does not allow for terc site prediction, as also seen with some other cyanobacteria  <cit> . rrna operons are scattered throughout the chromosome, not concentrated near the origin of replication, and in one case oriented against the presumed direction of replication. if anabaena sp. wa <dig> is oligoploid like many cyanobacteria  <cit> , then there may be less need to encode highly expressed genes such as the rrna operons near the origin of replication to increase their copy number or orient them to optimize transcription during replication. the plasmid is  <dig>  kbp long  and has an average gc content of  <dig>  %. there are  <dig> genes encoded on the plasmid, including  <dig> protein coding sequences, the majority of which are hypothetical proteins  or pseudogenes , and no rrna or trna genes .

comparison of anabaena sp. wa <dig> long- and short-read genome assemblies
dna from the anabaena sp. wa <dig> non-axenic culture was extracted in december  <dig>  and used to construct an illumina truseq metagenome. that library was sequenced as 100nt paired-end reads on the hiseq  <dig> instrument, yielding  <dig>  gbp of total sequence, of which  <dig> mbp  mapped to the closed anabaena sp. wa <dig> pacbio genome assembly. a draft anabaena sp. wa <dig> genome was extracted from an assembly of this short-read illumina sequencing data using the mmgenome package. the draft genome is not complete, but the sum length of contigs in the draft genome is within  <dig> % of the length of the closed anabaena sp. wa <dig> genome. when the draft genome is aligned against an hmm database of essential, universally conserved, bacterial genes from the mmgenome package,  <dig> essential genes found in other members of the nostocaceae are also found in the new genomes . this suggests that the draft genome is nearly complete and representative of actual gene content. using blastn,  <dig> of  <dig> contigs in the anabaena sp. wa <dig> draft genome align to the closed reference genome , further suggesting that the draft genome assembly has little contamination. some of the contigs in the draft genome overlap when aligned to the closed genome, forming  <dig> regions of contiguous coverage with  <dig> gaps that are scattered around the circular genome .

the gap regions sum to  <dig>  bp , containing  <dig> genes. over half of these  have more than one copy in the genome, including  <dig> genes from a single cluster of transposases. many single-copy hypothetical genes that coincide with gaps have low complexity regions. most gaps  coincide with long repeat regions in the genome, whose multiple copies are connected by green arcs . the repeat regions include the five rrna operons, genes encoding transposons and homing endonucleases, and other repeat regions discussed in more detail below. in some cases gaps coincide with gc-rich regions. these results agree with previous observations of gaps in illumina assemblies due to long repeat regions and regions of low nucleotide complexity  <cit> . the large number of contigs generated from the short-read illumina sequences emphasizes the prevalence of long repetitive elements in the anabaena sp. wa <dig> genome and the value of long-read sequencing technologies in producing finished genomes. this is further demonstrated by observations of tandem repeats in the long-read assembly, observation of structural variants in the population, analysis of genome synteny with another closely related anabaena genome, and a full count of mobile elements within the genome .

the anabaena sp. al <dig> culture and genome
anabaena sp. al <dig> is an anatoxin-a producing strain isolated in non-axenic culture from a toxic bloom in american lake, washington in  <dig> . it provides local geographical context for anabaena sp. wa <dig>  since american lake is only  <dig> km from anderson lake. it also provides some evolutionary context as a close relative of anabaena sp. wa <dig> . the genome was sequenced with  <dig>  gbp of illumina miseq 250-bp paired-end reads. contigs representing  <dig>  mbp of the anabaena sp. al <dig> draft genome were binned using the mmgenome package to yield a nearly complete genome with  <dig> essential genes according to the database in the mmgenome package.

phylogenomic relationship between anabaena sp. wa <dig>  al <dig>  and other fully sequenced nostocaceae
the closed genome from anabaena sp. wa <dig> and the draft genome from anabaena sp. al <dig> can be placed phylogenetically among draft and full genomes from members of the nostocaceae. the ancestral relationship of eleven genomes from the nostocaceae was hypothesized with a phylogenomic tree based on  <dig> clusters of unique orthologs from each genome . unanimity among  <dig> tree constructions yielded  <dig> % bootstrap support for every internal node. the tree was rooted at nostoc sp. pcc  <dig>  according to  <cit> . anabaena sp. wa <dig> and anabaena sp. al <dig> are most closely related to each other. they form a distinct clade with anabaena sp.  <dig>  a microcystin toxin-producing strain from finland  <cit> .

comparing gene content and metabolic capabilities of anabaena sp. wa <dig> and al <dig> with other nostocaceae genomes
the gene contents of anabaena sp. wa <dig> and closely related nostocaceae genomes were also assigned to metabolic pathways using the kegg ortholog database. all genes necessary for nitrogen fixation  were found throughout these genomes. figure  <dig> highlights metabolic pathways with differential representation in anabaena sp. wa <dig> and its relatives. differences in sulfur metabolism are evident among the genomes. the ssu operon, which is involved in transport and metabolism of organic sulfur compounds  <cit> , was intact in anabaena sp. wa <dig>  it was absent or incomplete in  <dig> of  <dig> nostocaceae, including anabaena sp.  <dig>  ssuabcde and taud  are in the same gene cluster in anabaena sp. wa <dig> and are likely co-regulated. anabaena sp. wa <dig> also possesses the fhubc genes, which encode two parts of the ferric hydroxamate abc transporter. the presence of these genes suggest that anabaena sp. wa <dig> is well equipped to import organic sulfur compounds and iron from the environment. this may provide a competitive advantage in providing the iron-sulfur clusters that are necessary for nitrogen fixation in niches with low sulfate availability.
fig.  <dig> kegg orthologs  differentially represented among the compared nostocaceae genomes. all proteins from each nostocaceae genome were mapped to the online ko database. orthologs with significant differences among the genomes were highlighted in the above table for comparison. nostocaceae genomes are arranged according to the phylogenomic tree for easy comparison. the anabaena sp. wa <dig> genome encodes a sulfur metabolism cluster absent or incomplete in  <dig> out of  <dig> nostocaceae genomes



other genes present in anabaena sp. wa <dig> but not in anabaena sp.  <dig> or other nostocaceae  may also provide competitive advantage under certain conditions. btub is necessary for vitamin b <dig> uptake from the environment  <cit> . the urtabcde cluster allows uptake and metabolism of nitrogen-rich urea  <cit> . cydab encode the cytochrome bd-type oxidase, which has been shown to be necessary for nostoc sp. pcc  <dig> survival under nitrogen-limited conditions and is hypothesized to scavenge oxygen in heterocysts to prevent oxidation of nitrogenase  <cit> . the presence of pixghijl genes, which encode a phototactic system, suggests that anabaena sp. wa <dig> is positively phototactic and likely motile  <cit> . in support of this hypothesis, anabaena sp. wa <dig> encodes a twitching-motility pilus gene pilt, and a pilus assembly gene pilc . gas vesicle genes present in two clusters  support mobility through buoyancy control  <cit> .

a number of metabolic genes are absent from anabaena sp. wa <dig>  but present in anabaena sp.  <dig> or other nostocaceae. pecabcef, the genes responsible for phycoerythrocyanin synthesis  <cit> ), are absent from anabaena sp. wa <dig> but present in its close relative anabaena sp. al <dig>  <cit> . phycoerythrocyanin is a photosynthetic pigment that absorbs light maximally at 575nm  and confers a competitive advantage in coastal and freshwater environments where phytoplankton and turbid waters absorb much of the red light that is maximally absorbed by the ubiquitous phycocyanin pigment  <cit> . these two strains can be distinguished by their pigments, a critical element in niche adaptation. both strains encode genes to synthesize the phycobilins phycocyanin and allophycocyanin, but only anabaena sp. al <dig> encodes the genes for phycoerythrocyanin synthesis. the absence of a phycoerythrocyanin operon suggests that anabaena sp. wa <dig> would not compete well in shade from other photosynthetic organisms or deeper and murkier water because it cannot efficiently absorb green light. rather, it may avoid shade or deeper water by positive phototaxis to the lake surface driven by gas vesicle buoyancy. the psbjlm components of the photosystem ii apparatus are intermittently distributed throughout the nostocaceae in this study but are completely absent from anabaena sp. wa <dig>  different combinations of light harvesting genes in each genome, without a phylogenetic pattern, suggest that they are selected for under different light conditions and perhaps horizontally transferred.

capacity for synthesis of anatoxin-a and other secondary metabolites
cyanobacteria produce many secondary metabolites, including products of nonribosomal peptide synthetase  and polyketide synthase  genes. much concern about freshwater cyanobacterial blooms stems from their production of toxic secondary metabolites. fourteen gene clusters in the anabaena sp. wa <dig> genome encode putative secondary metabolite synthesis proteins . anatoxin-a is made by proteins encoded in cluster eleven located between nucleotides  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig>  confirming that anabaena sp. wa <dig> indeed is able to produce anatoxin-a, as detected by lc-ms/ms . the anaa-g genes in this  <dig> kbp cluster are syntenous with homologs in anabaena sp.  <dig> and anabaena sp. al <dig> . however, genes anaa, anai, and anaj are rearranged between the anabaena anatoxin-a clusters and the oscillatoria and cylindrospermum clusters  <cit> .
fig.  <dig> nucleotide alignment of anatoxin-a clusters from cyanobacteria. anaa-g and anai are all conserved in anabaena sp. wa <dig> and anabaena sp. al <dig>  though anah is missing from both. the 5’ region of anab and upstream promoter region is triplicated in anabaena sp. wa <dig>  the anatoxin-a cluster from anabaena sp. wa <dig> is most similar to that from anabaena sp.  <dig>  the three anabaena strains share a gene of unknown function downstream of anag . the anag genes differ in size, correlated with different variants of anatoxin-a. shorter variants of anag omit or truncate a putative methyl transferase domain. the anaf and anag genes share a region of  <dig> % nucleotide identity that is likely a homologous protein domain. anabaena sp. wa <dig> and al <dig> encode two of the shortest anag genes and produce anatoxin-a, cylindrospermum sp. pcc  <dig> produces dihydroanatoxin-a , and oscillatoria sp. pcc  <dig> primarily produces homoanatoxin-a



comparing ana clusters between anabaena sp. wa <dig>  anabaena sp. al <dig>  anabaena sp.  <dig>  cylindrospermum stagnale sp. pcc  <dig>  and oscillatoria sp. pcc  <dig> showed differences in the anag gene . the anag protein plays a key role in determining the anatoxin variant produced  <cit> . anag adds an acetyl group and either one or two methyl groups to the bicyclic thioester precursor, forming either anatoxin-a or homoanatoxin-a, respectively. oscillatoria sp. pcc  <dig>  which produces  <dig> % homoanatoxin-a and  <dig> % anatoxin-a, possesses the largest methyltransferase domain in anag. the smaller anag methyltransferase domain in anabaena sp.  <dig>  a producer of anatoxin-a  <cit> , is evidently not involved in homoanatoxin-a synthesis. the anag methyltransferase domain is missing entirely in anabaena sp. wa <dig> and anabaena sp. al <dig>  which are also producers of anatoxin-a . in cylindrospermum sp. pcc  <dig>  which produces dihydroanatoxin-a, anag lacks the methyltransferase domain as well as the phosphopantetheine transferase domain on the extreme c-terminus . in the same strain, an oxidoreductase gene, cylst <dig>  not present in the other ana clusters, is present  and implicated in dihydroanatoxin-a synthesis  <cit> . note that annotation of genes anah-j differs between  <cit>  and  <cit> ; we have chosen to follow  <cit> .

the anatoxin-a synthetase gene cluster from anabaena sp. al <dig> revealed an organization most similar to that of anabaena sp. wa <dig>  although the al <dig> anag gene is shorter in the c-terminal region. there are also differences in genes situated between anag and anai, which include genes not thought to be involved in anatoxin synthesis. notably, all clusters , share a mate efflux pump homolog . mate efflux pumps encoded within the saxitoxin gene cluster are known to export saxitoxin, another toxic secondary metabolite, from the producing cell  <cit> . they may play a similar role with anatoxin-a.

lack of synteny with anabaena sp. 90
among the completely sequenced anabaena genomes, anabaena sp. wa <dig> is most closely related to anabaena sp.  <dig>  sharing an average nucleotide identity  of  <dig>  % and  <dig> gene homologs. despite this relatively close relationship, there are major differences in overall genome architecture. whereas the anabaena sp.  <dig> genome has two chromosomes of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mbp, anabaena sp. wa <dig> has a single chromosome. local nucleotide alignment showed that there is little long-range synteny between the two anabaena genomes .

novichkov et al. illustrated common paradigms of synteny between genomes within a genus using dotplots  <cit> . aligning genomes between species of pseudomonas yielded long stretches of synteny, but aligning genomes between species of streptococcus showed no synteny. those dotplots are recreated and shown beside the dotplot for anabaena sp.  <dig> and wa <dig> . orthologs from each pair of aligned genomes were aligned by blastp, showing that average amino acid identity between orthologs of the anabaena genomes was the highest . the dotplot of the anabaena genomes is very fragmented, although these genomes are relatively closely related. the distinct x-shape to dotplots of pseudomonas and streptococcus genomes indicate chromosomal inversions around the origin of replication  <cit> . this pattern is missing in the dotplot of anabaena genomes, indicating the infrequency or absence of these inversions. figure  <dig> indicates that the anabaena genomes have experienced a relatively faster rate of recombination versus point mutation. this is not uncommon among bacterial genomes but varies among different taxa  <cit> . length distributions of the local colinear blocks  from alignments calculated by mauve  support the general disruption of gene order between anabaena sp. wa <dig> and  <dig>  the largest local colinear blocks  encompass biosynthetic gene clusters and a cryptic prophage discussed below. the lcbs are not clearly bounded by either repeat sequences or mobile elements, which does not lend a clear explanation for their rearrangement between the two bacteria.
fig.  <dig> dotplots and average ortholog similarity for pairwise comparisons within three bacterial genera. dotplots illustrate preservation or absence of long-range nucleotide similarity  between paired genomes from anabaena in this study and pseudomonas and streptococcus 



in addition to long-range shuffling, we also detected local rearrangement of genes within clusters. for instance, an lcb at nucleotides  <dig> ,912- <dig> , <dig> that includes thirteen genes in anabaena sp. wa <dig> corresponds to the region between nucleotides  <dig> ,881- <dig> , <dig> in anabaena sp.  <dig> that includes fourteen genes . genes in this syntenous region are putatively involved in complex carbohydrate biosynthesis and export . of these, two glycosyltransferases, an acyltransferase, and a hypothetical protein are unique to anabaena sp. wa <dig> and six glycosyltransferases are unique to anabaena sp.  <dig>  the remaining nine genes in anabaena sp. wa <dig> and eight genes in anabaena sp.  <dig> are homologous or share homologous domains. two transposases are responsible for interrupting just one portion of synteny in this region, leaving  <dig> breaks in synteny unexplained. this suggests that recombination interrupts synteny even in otherwise conserved gene clusters, though the mechanism for recombination is not always clear.

the mobilome
one hundred eight transposases  were automatically annotated by the ncbi pipeline, constituting  <dig> % of the genome. manual annotation with the aid of the is finder database  <cit>  increased the number of intact and fragmented transposases to  <dig>  in addition to transposases,  <dig> hnh homing endonuclease reverse transcriptases are encoded in the anabaena sp. wa <dig> genome, bringing the total number of intact and degenerate mobile elements to  <dig>  phylogenetic relationships between insertion sequences show that two groups of closely related is4-family insertion sequences predominate  among a wider representation of is families . aligning nucleotide sequences adjacent to each side of the coding sequence of these insertion sequences revealed the unique inverted repeat sequence for each group: attcaacayttctg for the is10-like group, and ccgccttgtcacccgttaag for the is4sa-like group. these two groups of transposases catalyze their transposition via three acidic residues in their active site: two aspartates and a glutamate, and transpose in a cut-and-paste fashion   <cit> .
fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of transposase protein sequences encoded in the anabaena sp. wa <dig> genome. the phylogenetic relationship between  <dig> annotated transposase protein sequences is sketched out in the tree. two large clades of closely related transposases dominate the tree. the is4sa clade includes  <dig> transposases and the is <dig> clade includes  <dig> transposases, which both belong to the larger is <dig> transposase family. these transposases have a dde-type active site that facilitates cut-and-paste transposition. the is4sa clade has an identical terminal direct repeat sequence: ccgccttgtcacccgttaag. the is <dig> clade has the terminal direct repeat sequence: attcaacayttctg



other common mobile elements found in bacterial genomes are prophages, cryptic prophages, and phage-like elements such as gene transfer agents . no signature phage regions were detected with the phast phage-detection webserver. the islandviewer  <dig> webserver, which detects genomic islands, highlighted an  <dig> kbp region between nucleotides  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig>  this region is also contained in the largest local colinear block  calculated by mauve between anabaena sp. wa <dig> and anabaena sp.  <dig> . within the lcb, there is a  <dig> kbp insertion in anabaena sp. wa <dig> relative to anabaena sp.  <dig>  the lcb boundaries likely denote the exact boundaries of a cryptic prophage: nucleotides  <dig> ,211- <dig> , <dig>  this region contains a putative phage terminase large subunit that was automatically annotated by prokka and confirmed with  <dig> % confidence by phyre <dig> structure-guided annotation. the terminase large subunit is a component of a dna packaging protein unique to caudovirales. within this region also lie  <dig> hypothetical proteins, one is- <dig> family transposase, one pseudogene, and one integrase. the large proportion of hypothetical proteins is consistent with a phage origin. the integrase lies  <dig> nucleotides downstream of a methionine trna, which may have served as an integration site  of the prophage. the gc content in the region is  <dig>  %, lower than the genome average of  <dig>  % and consistent with a horizontally transferred region that has a distinct nucleotide composition. the small size of the region, lack of other identifiable phage proteins such as capsid or tail structure proteins, and the insertion of a transposon common to the bacterial genome suggest that this region is a partly degraded cryptic prophage. several other phage integrases were automatically annotated, but these integrases are often functionally mislabeled. alternatively, they may be site-specific integrases native to or co-opted by the bacterial genome for functions other than prophage integration and excision. these alternative functions are likely, considering the absence of other readily identifiable phage genes near these integrases.

besides transposons and phage-like elements, a single plasmid was identified, rounding out the mobile element complement of anabaena sp. wa <dig>  the plasmid was identified as a  <dig> kbp contig assembled from pacbio reads. fifteen kbp of nucleotide sequence from each end of the contig aligned with  <dig> % similarity  and was excised from the final plasmid. the trimmed plasmid sequence is  <dig> kbp long, with a  <dig>  % average gc content. the  <dig> genes on the plasmid include  <dig> intact and  <dig> pseudogenes. a parab operon on the plasmid suggests that it is a low-copy plasmid  with a well described partitioning mechanism  <cit> . the parab operon and surrounding nucleotide sequence bears at least  <dig> % similarity to the parab operon and its surrounding sequence on the chromosome . interestingly, the plasmid carries at least part of a non-ribosomal peptide synthase  cluster. one protein within the cluster shows significant similarity to adpd from the anabaenopeptilide cluster in anabaena sp.  <dig> . the other three biosynthetic proteins in the cluster show similarity to a malonyl coa-acyl carrier protein transacylase, a β-ketoacyl synthase, and a short-chain dehydrogenase. plasmid-borne nrps clusters are not uncommon. a recent comprehensive survey of nrps and polyketide synthase  clusters in all bacterial genomic data deposited at the national center for biotechnology information  revealed that  <dig> % of nrps/pks clusters in cyanobacteria are located on plasmids  <cit> . importantly, the plasmid encodes four putative site-specific integrases, which may facilitate integration into a bacterial chromosome. coupled with nucleotide similarity between the plasmid and the chromosome, where site-specific integrases can also be found, this indicates that the region of plasmid similarity on the chromosome may be considered a genomic island.

relationship between the anabaena sp. wa <dig> genome and the anderson lake metagenome
to relate the anabaena sp. wa <dig> genome to a bloom in anderson lake, the wa <dig> metagenome was sampled from anderson lake on july 7th,  <dig> . the sample was taken near the peak of a cyanobacterial bloom, when the anatoxin-a level was  <dig> μg/l . the metagenome contains a genome from a strain of anabaena sp. wa <dig> that is nearly identical to the culture and is likely an ancestor from  <dig> months before the culture strain was isolated and  <dig>  years before it was sequenced. reads from the july  <dig> metagenome short-read illumina), the december  <dig> culture , and the december  <dig> culture  were mapped to the closed reference genome to track changes in the genome over time.

a recent deletion event in the anabaena sp. wa <dig> genome
the length of the pacbio reads not only allowed us to close the anabaena sp. wa <dig> genome but also revealed structural variation in the population. the  <dig> kbp segment between nucleotides  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> was also present  on a  <dig> kbp contig in the pacbio assembly, reflecting the existence of a 4kbp indel variant within the genomes of the anabaena sp. wa  <dig> culture population . mapping reads from the anabaena sp. wa <dig> pacbio dataset showed that the contig had an average coverage of 25x, approximately one-third of the average coverage of the chromosome , and that the deletion actually lies between nucleotides  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig>  this suggests that the deletion is present in two-thirds of the anabaena sp. wa <dig> culture population. the indel appears to be a deletion that arose after december  <dig>  since the longer sequence is predominant in sequencing reads from both the july  <dig> metagenome and the december  <dig> culture . an xsea homolog  and two hypothetical gene products are deleted in the variant. in well characterized escherichia coli xsea mutants, there is an increased recombination phenotype  <cit> , suggesting the same may be true for two-thirds of the anabaena sp. wa <dig> culture population.
fig.  <dig> a deletion mutation was detected in the pacbio long-read assembly of the anabaena sp. wa <dig> culture. mapping reads to the indel region showed that the deletion occurred between nucleotides  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig>  the deletion arose after december  <dig> and expanded through the population to roughly two-thirds of the culture population by december 2014

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the recently cultured toxic isolate, anabaena sp. wa <dig>  closely reflects the parent population in anderson lake
anabaena sp. wa <dig> is a novel anatoxin-a-producing member of the nostocaceae isolated from anderson lake on the olympic peninsula in washington in  <dig>  it is in stable non-axenic culture. the anabaena sp. wa <dig> genome is unique among sequenced anabaena genomes because it was sequenced within seven months of isolation. other anabaena strains have been in culture for several decades prior to whole genome sequencing and changes in a strain’s genome can accumulate over such long periods. sequencing a strain soon after isolation increases the relevance of the sequenced genome to the environment from which it was isolated and provides a reference point for later studies of the strain’s genome.

anabaena sp. wa <dig> produces anatoxin-a in culture . the toxin is produced by nrps and pks enzymes encoded by the anaa-j gene cluster. a triple tandem repeat of the anab putative promoter region in the cultured isolate  is present in a nearly identical strain in the environment , which suggests that it originates from and is relevant to the lake environment. tandem repeats of genes and promoters commonly arise in bacterial genomes but are unstable and can collapse through homologous recombination or strand slippage at high frequency, unless the repeat is under selection  <cit> . thus, tandem repeats have been hypothesized to act as a crude selection-regulated response to environmental change . additionally, tandem repeats provide redundancy that drives the innovation, amplification, divergence  cycle that generates genetic novelty  <cit> . tandemly repeated promoters, in particular, allow for promoter regions to generate or acquire new regulatory binding sites that can change the expression pattern of an operon  <cit> . further study of this tandem repeat may be fruitful for several reasons. most noteworthy is that these tandem repeats are 617nt long and identical, which makes them highly susceptible to homologous recombination that can either expand or collapse the repeats  <cit> . tandem repeats tend to be deleted rather than expanded unless deletion is selected against. this instability may be exacerbated by the deletion of the xsea gene in part of the population , which causes a hyper recombination phenotype in escherichia coli. that the tandem triplication can be detected in anabaena sp. wa <dig> over a span of two years, including in anderson lake, suggests that a selective pressure in the lake and in the culture may be maintaining the triplication. key questions are whether the tandem repeat increases expression of the anabcd operon and production of anatoxin-a, and whether elevated expression is under selection. determining the selective pressure preserving the tandem repeat in the anabaena sp. wa <dig> culture may illuminate the function of anatoxin-a in the environment.

closing the genome reveals details about genome architecture
long-read sequencing technology will increasingly allow for bacterial genomes to be assembled in a single step  <cit> . closing the anabaena sp. wa <dig> genome with as few as two pacbio smrt cells demonstrates that it is pragmatic to use non-axenic environmental enrichments of targeted bacterial species in order to obtain their finished genomes. the long-read library  used in this study yielded an average read length of  <dig>  kbp, which is long enough to span long-repeat regions in most bacterial genomes including refractory genomes such as those of the bloom-forming cyanobacteria anabaena and microcystis  <cit> . greater access to long-read sequencing raises expectations for the quality of bacterial genome assembly and will yield new insight into the mobilome and structural variation in bacterial populations. the mobilome in many bacteria may be under-represented because mobile elements that are repeated throughout bacterial genomes cannot be assembled correctly with short-insert dna libraries. observing structural variation such as erosion of synteny  and accumulation of local repeats  will enhance our understanding of bacterial evolution. in fact, short-insert libraries can be incorrectly assembled to suggest features that do not exist. an example of that is the missrepresentation of the anab tandem repeat region in the anabaena sp. wa <dig> genome . de novo assembly of short-insert genomic libraries is not sufficient to determine the number of replicons in a genome or overall gene order. further, this method is liable to miss structural variants within a population, such as the fractional presence of an xsea-bearing insertion . while short-read sequencing possesses distinct shortcomings in describing structural features of a genome, nearly all single-copy genes that make up the majority of a bacterial genome can be assembled from short-read illumina sequencing runs .

predicted ecologic profile of anabaena sp. wa102
mapping proteins from anabaena sp. wa <dig> to the kegg ortholog database indicates a metabolism acclimated to a nutrient-rich freshwater environment with ample sunlight. the inability to produce phycoerythrocyanin, produced by some related anabaena, coupled with positive phototaxis and gas vesicle operons suggest that it competes for light by outmaneuvering other photosynthetic organisms and rising to the surface of the water to avoid niches with less green light. competition experiments between other nitrogen-fixing autotrophs and anabaena sp. wa <dig> could test these hypotheses. freshwater cyanobacteria are known to secrete hydroxamate-based siderophores to chelate iron in water  <cit> . these siderophores, including those encoded by the fhu genes in anabaena sp. wa <dig>  are then transported across the cell membrane by ferric-hydroxamate transporters  <cit> . efficiently scavenging sulfur and iron would help maintain iron-sulfur clusters that are heavily used in nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis, so the predicted ability of anabaena sp. wa <dig> to assimilate organic sulfur and oxidized iron from the lake environment may confer a growth advantage in some conditions over cyanobacteria lacking ssu, tau and fhu genes .

evolution of the anabaena sp. wa <dig> genome
a genomic island and a complementary plasmid carrying novel genetic cargo , tandem triplication of a promoter , observed deletion of a 4kb fragment of the genome , the ubiquity of mobile elements , and the nearly total absence of synteny with anabaena sp.  <dig>  suggest that the genome is in rapid flux. the potential for the genome to radically rearrange may allow anabaena sp. wa <dig> to respond to gradual changes in the environment, such as climate change, if such changes offer the opportunity to adjust gene expression profiles. the increased availability of closed genomes as long-read sequencing becomes more widely used will allow us to quantify the rate of recombination in genomes in anabaena and in other bacteria. it will then be possible to test hypotheses for the most prevalent mechanisms and drivers of genome remodeling.

more genomes from closely related species need to be finished with long-read sequencing. these genomes can then be arranged in an alignable tight genome cluster and assayed for gene family growth and loss, and for rearrangements  <cit> . alternatively, resequencing metagenomes of the original environment of anabaena sp. wa <dig> - anderson lake - at regular intervals is currently feasible. this approach would generate a regular time series record of differences in the population genome of anabaena sp. wa <dig> in its native environment with nucleotide resolution.
