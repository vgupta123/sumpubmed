BACKGROUND
linear motifs are known to facilitate many protein-protein interactions  <cit> . despite the availability of a large volume of data about protein-protein interactions and their sequences, linear motifs are difficult to discover, due to their short length, which is between three and ten amino acids  <cit> . recently, several methods have been developed for discovering linear motifs of protein-protein interactions  <cit> , but most methods focus on detecting individual linear motifs rather than interacting motif pairs. motif pairs are more useful than motifs for filtering many spurious protein interactions in current high-throughput data, and for identifying a functional target.

supervised learning or stochastic methods are often used to predict linear motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. both negative and positive interactions are required to train the methods. unlike positive interaction data, negative samples cannot be readily obtained from protein-protein interaction data. assuming a negative interaction where there is no explicit evidence of a positive interaction results in a much larger negative data set than a positive data set. such an unbalance between positive and negative data sets makes a prediction biased  <cit> . generating a negative data set via random selection often does not reflect the original distribution of data, thus it does not produce a good prediction model.

there are a few methods for generating a negative data set. jansen et al.  <cit>  generate a data set of negative interactions by assuming that proteins in different subcellular compartments of a cell do not interact. however, different subcellular locations only indicate that the proteins have a lower chance of binding than those in the same location, and some proteins are found in more than one subcellular compartment of a cell  <cit> . the method developed by gomez et al.  <cit>  assumes a negative protein interaction, if there is no explicit evidence of an interaction. however, this assumption generates a negative data set that is too large, resulting in low sensitivity in interaction predictions. the method that uses the shortest path  <cit>  has difficulty in obtaining a negative data set of the desired size. the method that uses sequence similarity  <cit>  also has difficulty in controlling the size of the negative data set.

in this study, we developed a bootstrapping algorithm for generating a negative data set of protein-protein interactions, and a new boosting algorithm for finding interacting motif pairs from positive and negative data sets. the remainder of the paper describes the algorithms and their experimental results with various parameter values.

RESULTS
we measured the prediction performance of the boosting algorithm in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.

  sensitivity=tptp+fn 

  specificity=tntn+fp 

  accuracy=tp+tntp+fp+tn+fn 

in the following description, the sampling size s is the number of negative samples that were examined to generate a single negative data via bootstrapping. when the number of negative samples with m-th feature =  <dig> is greater than the acceptance ratio a, the m-th feature of the re-sampled negative data is set to  <dig>  the feature vector and the acceptance ratio are described in detail in the method section.

affect of acceptance ratios
from the interactions between human and virus proteins, we generated four different negative data sets, by executing the bootstrapping algorithm with four acceptance ratios . then, we used both the negative and positive data sets to test the boosting algorithm via five-fold cross validation. motif pairs predicted from each fold were combined as follows: mi = {motif pairs found in at least i folds} where i = { <dig>   <dig>  ..., 5}  <cit> . table  <dig> shows the number of motif pairs predicted with different acceptance ratios.

mi denotes a set of motif pairs found in at least i folds during five-fold cross validation.

as the acceptance ratio increases, re-sampled negative data have fewer nonzero features, resulting in more motif pairs. this is because the nonzero features of negative data are used to filter out the features that are also nonzero in positive data.

with the sampling size of  <dig>  most non-interaction data were re-sampled to generate a negative data set. we compared the prediction performance of the algorithm with respect to four different acceptance ratios. as shown in table  <dig>  prediction of motif pairs with a larger acceptance ratio shows a much better performance than that with a smaller acceptance ratio. as the acceptance ratio increases, negative data have more nonzero features. hence, data with many zero features are easily classified as negative samples.

as the acceptance ratio a increases, the prediction performance of motif pairs is improved.

affect of proportions of positive and negative data sets
for the purpose of comparing the prediction performance with respect to different proportions of positive and negative data sets, we generated three negative data sets with the sampling size of  <dig> and acceptance ratio of 1/ <dig>  the data set for  <dig>  interactions between human proteins and virus proteins was used as the positive data set. table  <dig> and figure  <dig> show the prediction performance with respect to three different proportions of positive and negative data sets. as the proportion of positive data increases, sensitivity increases, but specificity decreases. it is interesting to note that the size of the negative data sets alone affects the performance.

p: positive data, n: negative data.

affect of boosting algorithms
the execution time of the boosting algorithm is influenced by the number of hypotheses , the number of partitioned data sets , and the number of randomly selected training data for weak hypotheses . suppose that we set parameters; t =  <dig>  s =  <dig> and r =  <dig> . yu's adaboost uses  <dig> Ã—  <dig> =  <dig> weak hypotheses. but, our boosting algorithm uses only five weak hypotheses. while yu's adaboost uses four weak hypotheses per data set, our boosting algorithm uses only one weak hypothesis per data set. with fewer weak hypotheses than yu's adaboost algorithm, our algorithm has a better performance, as shown in table  <dig> 

parameter values: t =  <dig>  s =  <dig>  r =  <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
when positive and negative training data sets are unbalanced, the result via the prediction model tends to be biased. we developed a bootstrapping algorithm for generating a negative data set of arbitrary size from protein-protein interaction data. we also developed an efficient boosting algorithm for finding interacting motif pairs in human and virus proteins. the boosting algorithm showed the best performance  with balanced positive and negative data sets. the boosting algorithm was also used to find potential motif pairs in complexes of human and virus proteins, for which structural data was not used for training the algorithm. interacting motif pairs common to multiple folds of structural data of complexes were proven to be statistically significant.

this method predicts protein-protein interactions and motif pairs using the protein sequence data. the sequence information alone is insufficient to predict motif pairs for some proteins, but our method provides a useful model for predicting motif pairs in protein-protein interactions when the sequence is the only information available. the data set for interactions between human and virus proteins was extracted from bond and is available at . the complexes of human and virus proteins were extracted from pdb and their identifiers are available at .
