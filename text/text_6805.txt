BACKGROUND
reproductive traits are of primary interest in livestock because they play a major role in efficiency of production. selection for increased number of offspring has been employed in pigs with only limited success because of its low heritability and sex-limited nature  <cit> . genetic characterization of litter size and its components  will increase our understanding of the underlying physiology and could enhance genetic improvement through use of marker-assisted selection   <cit> . in the past several decades, the reproductive strategy of the chinese taihu pigs, a breed which farrows three to five more piglets per litter than american or european pig breeds, has come under intense scrutiny  <cit> . the greater litter size at farrowing in multiparous chinese taihu sows is due, in part, to a greater ovulation rate, a greater embryonic survival, a lower fertilization failure rate, and a greater uterine capacity  <cit> .

in order to isolate the factors controlling the component traits of litter size, the differentially expressed  genes were characterized during conceptus transformation, in meishan-landrace conceptuses and endometrial tissue when compared with conventional landrace sows, in the porcine endometrium between pregnant and non-pregnant sows, and in the erhualian and large white placenta  <cit> . furthermore, de genes were identified in porcine ovarian follicles of multiparous sows on  <dig> d to  <dig> d of the estrous cycle between a line of pigs selected for an index of ovulation rate and embryo survival and its randomly selected control line  <cit> . however, the de genes in chinese taihu and large white preovulatory follicles remain unexplored.

to develop a broader view of the gene expression in preovulatory ovary and to identify the key genes involved in ovulation, we used affymetrix microarrays to screen the genes differentially expressed in preovulatory follicles from chinese taihu and large white sows simulated by hcg at  <dig> h after pmsg administration. bioinformatics analysis has revealed these de genes were involved in important biological processes such as reproduction and the de genes were then in silico mapped to quantitative trait loci  regions related to reproduction traits. real-time rt-pcr was used to confirm the expression profiles of various genes. and association analyses of two de genes  with litter size were carried out to screen the molecular markers for litter size. this research identified candidate genes, molecular markers and pathways associated with ovulation rate, and gained a further insight into the genetic basis of the prolificacy of chinese taihu pigs.

RESULTS
transcriptome analysis
expression profiling experiments of large white and chinese taihu ovary follicles were conducted by a commercial affymetrix porcine genechip including  <dig>  probe sets, which represent  <dig>  transcripts and  <dig> controls. the transcriptome of ovarian follicles from chinese taihu sows was determined, and  <dig>  probe sets were identified to have expression in the ovary follicles. expression was detected for  <dig>  transcripts  in large white ovarian follicles. a total of  <dig>  transcripts  were expressed in chinese taihu ovarian follicles .

differentially expressed  gene analysis
the global expression profile of chinese taihu porcine ovaries challenged with pmsg-hcg was compared with that of the large white sows. probe sets whose intensities were normalized and filtered, then were subjected to identifying significantly differentially expressed genes using t-test analysis by comparing the log <dig>  of two breeds, and  <dig>  transcripts were identified to be differentially expressed at the p ≤  <dig>  level . fold change  is the gene expression level  of chinese taihu sows compared to large white compared to large white sows. taking a fc ≥  <dig> or ≤  <dig>  and the p ≤  <dig>  significance level as the criteria,  <dig> transcripts showed differential expression. a set of  <dig> transcripts belonged to the up-regulated group and the other set of  <dig> transcripts belonged to the down-regulated group in chinese taihu sows . of the  <dig> de transcripts,  <dig> were annotated pig genes,  <dig> transcripts could be determined for human homologous putative identities based on blast searches, and  <dig> additional probes did not have any database matches. gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway analyses of  <dig> annotated de gene lists were carried out by using the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery . go annotation mapping revealed that the genes assigned go terms for regulation of cellular process, regulation of biological process, biological regulation, developmental process, cell communication and signal transduction and so on . de transcripts were involved in some important pathways including the wnt signaling pathway, p <dig> signaling pathway and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis .

verification of gene expression pattern from microarray data by real-time rt-pcr
eight genes  were selected to confirm the expression pattern by real-time rt-pcr. the results indicated that expression patterns of seven genes were consistent with the microarray . a contradiction expression profile was detected in cnn <dig> gene . this variance most likely came from technical differences.

in silico mapping of de genes to the interval of reproduction qtls
through blast of the  <dig> probes sets against ensembl sus_scrofa database ,  <dig> differentially expressed probes sets  were in silico mapped pig chromosome covering 1- <dig> and x . ninety-two de transcripts were located to porcine reproduction qtl chromosomal regions . one such gene is the pig bmpr1b gene, which was localized to chromosome  <dig> within the interval of qtls for ovulation rate, number of corpora lutea, litter size and prenatal survival  <cit> . another gene is kit-ligand/stem cell factor gene, which was located in the qtls region for ovulation rate and fsh level  <cit> .

bax and bmpr1b as the candidate genes for litter size
bax and bmpr1b were selected to be the candidate genes for litter size based on their biological functions on female reproduction and their positions within the intervals of qtls. bax t/c mutation in the intron  <dig> was genotyped as previously described  <cit> , and bmpr1b c/g mutation was genotyped by pcr-sacii-rflp method which was established in the present study. as shown in figure  <dig>  the  <dig> bp bax gene pcr amplicon containing t/c mutation was detectable by digestion with eari, resulting in allele t  and allele c   <cit> ; the  <dig> bp bmpr1b gene pcr amplicon containing c/g mutation was detectable by digestion with sacii, resulting in allele c  and allele g . genotyping results showed some variations in allele frequency between chinese indigenous and western breeds . briefly, the bax allele c was fixed in taihu, tongcheng, hezuo, landrace, duroc and white duroc pigs; the bmpr1b allele c was fixed in huainan, tongcheng, hezuo, large white i, landrace, duroc, white duroc and pietrain pigs. association analyses revealed that bax cc had larger litter size than tc for both total number of piglets born  and the number of piglets born alive  of all parities in large white pigs , and for nba of both the 1st parity and all the parities in the div pigs  . the additive effects of bax gene in large white pigs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the bmpr1b cc was suggestively different with cg  in nba of all the parities in div line and the dominance effect was - <dig>  piglet/litter  .

discussion
it is reported that a proportionately greater increase in ovulation rate occurs in chinese taihu after they have experienced pregnancy than with european breeds  <cit> . using microarray expression profiling to identify changes in rna levels resulting from genetic background, our studies revealed differential expression of  <dig> de genes in ovarian follicle tissues at the preovulatory phase of the estrous cycle. several genes not previously associated with the processes of follicle maturation or ovulation, were differentially expressed in follicle pools of the large white and chinese taihu sows. moreover,  <dig> probes with blastn matches to gene sequences of known function in human and  <dig> probes with no database matches, were also identified as being differentially expressed.

three de gene pathways associated with p <dig> gene
wnt signaling pathway, p <dig> signaling pathway and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  were the major pathways including de transcripts, and all of these three pathways are associated with p <dig> which was shown to promote apoptosis but not proliferation in ovarian granulosa cells  <cit> .

the first evidence of the important role of wnt signaling in the ovary was provided by vainio et al., which demonstrated that wnt <dig> mutant mice lost most of their oocyte reserve in the days prior to birth  <cit> . in the present study, six genes  involved in wnt signaling pathway were differentially expressed in large white and chinese taihu sows. dkk <dig> acts as an antagonist of wnt signaling to induce endocytosis of the wnt-fz receptor complex  <cit> . ctnnbip <dig> was found to negatively regulate wnt signaling via inhibition of the interaction between β-catenin and t cell factor   <cit> . wnt inhibitory factor  <dig> , a secreted antagonist that can bind to wnt proteins directly and inhibit wnt signaling pathway, was also differentially expressed .

pathway analysis found that two de genes  were involved in p <dig> signaling pathway and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. the bcl- <dig> associated x protein  is a member of the bcl- <dig> protein family and functions as an accelerator of apoptosis. the regulatory activity of bax in follicular endowment likely occurs during primordial germ cell  migration, prior to pgc colonization of the gonad  <cit> .

hormone related genes
animal reproduction system is regulated by a suite of hormones. the serum hormone level of chinese taihu pigs was compared with the european in order to detect the mechanisms of high prolificacy of chinese taihu pigs. chinese taihu ovarian follicles tended to have a higher concentration of oestradiol in follicular fluid  compared to large white hybrids  <cit> .

in our study, very limited hormone related genes were differentially expressed. one such gene encodes the caspase  <dig> associated protein  <dig>  which differentially suppresses steroid hormone receptor - induced transcriptional activity by interfering with their association with steroid hormone receptor coactivator  <dig> /n-coa <dig> and src3/n-coa <dig>  <cit> . another one encodes cysteine - rich angiogenic inducer  <dig>  which was known to be responsive to estrogen or to interact with estrogen receptor  <cit> . galp gene encodes a member of the galanin family of neuropeptides and has been implicated in biological processes involving the central nervous system including hypothalamic regulation of metabolism and reproduction  <cit> .

however, the well-known hormone related genes including estrogen receptor , follicle stimulating hormone  beta, retinol binding protein  <dig>  genes had similar expressions in the two pig breeds. there are three major gene systems associated with follicular growth and ovulation:  igf- <dig>  estrogen and fsh gene,  the steroid receptors as well as orphan nuclear receptors and their ligands, and  the wnt/frizzled pathways  <cit> . in our study, their expressions of the genes from the first two systems probably were normalized by pmsg-hcg, and the genes from the last system remained differentially expressed.

positional candidate genes for female reproduction traits
differentially expressed genes were in silico mapped to reproduction qtl regions. one of these genes is bmpr1b which played a pivotal role in bone formation during embryogenesis and fracture repair, and its mutation was associated with the increased ovulation rate of the booroola sheep with fecb phenotype  <cit> . the pig bmpr1b gene was mapped to  <dig> cm on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , where the qtl for ovulation rate at approximately  <dig> cm, the qtl for number of corpora lutea at approximately  <dig> cm and  <dig> cm were reported to be located  <cit> .

another gene, the kit gene encoding the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor kit maps to the mouse w locus  <cit> . kit-ligand/stem cell factor induces primordial follicle development and initiates folliculogenesis  <cit> . the pig kit gene was located to 8p12- <dig>  which is the same region as the qtl for ovulation rate at approximately  <dig> cm and for fsh level at approximately  <dig> - <dig>  cm  <cit> .

two de genes mutations and their associations with litter size
marker-assisted selection  in conjunction with traditional selection methods is most effective for the traits such as litter size, which are either expressed later in life, are sex-dependent, or are of low heritability  <cit> . the candidate gene approach has led to notable success in demonstrating reproduction-related genetic markers or major genes, such as esr, the erythopoietin receptor , the prolactin receptor , fsh-β and rbp <dig>  <cit> . differentially expressed transcripts also can be evaluated as potential candidates if they meet the following criteria: the chromosomal location to a region containing a qtl, the importance of the tissue of interest in regulating the expression of the specific quantitative trait, and the critical developing stage responsible for the differences in the specific quantitative trait  <cit> .

here we selected the differentially expressed genes- bax and bmpr1b as the candidate genes for litter traits due to their chromosomal location and/or their biological function. some mutations were genotyped in several chinese native pig breeds and western pig breeds, and the results showed allele bax c and bmpr1b c were fixed in several tested pig populations including huainan, tongcheng, landrace, duroc, white duroc and pietrain pigs. we also noticed that in div line and large white pigs allele bax c and bmpr1b c were not fixed, but bax tt and bmpr1b gg did not nearly appear, possibly because the homozygotes led to embryonic lethality in these specific pig populations. the association analyses of these mutations with litter traits were carried out in large white and chinese div line pigs. the bax gene was significantly associated with the litter size in these two populations, suggesting this mutation might be a good marker for pig selection and breeding. suggestive association  was found between the bmpr1b and litter size, in some ways similar to the results of tomas et al., which also only found suggestive associations  between the bmpr1b haplotypes and the number of piglets born alive and weaned when data from the first parity of iberian × meishan f <dig> sows were considered  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have reported differential gene expression in ovarian follicles at the preovulatory stage of a pmsg-hcg stimulated estrous cycle of two pig breeds with different ovulation rate. some differentially expressed genes and key pathways related to biological and cellular regulation were identified. furthermore, two differentially expressed genes- bax and bmpr1b genes were genotyped and associated with the litter size traits in large white and chinese div pigs. the results of this study provide an opportunity to elucidate the genetic control of ovulation rate and improve our understanding of high prolificacy of chinese taihu pigs.
