BACKGROUND
in vitro cell models play an important role in understanding cellular events related to physiological conditions in humans. many advantages such as accessibility, homogeneity of the cell population, reproducibility, growth rate, and hence the amount of material for analysis make them indispensable study objects in the search for molecular mechanisms. the differentiation process of intestinal cells, pathologies related with inflammatory conditions in the intestine, but also the adaptation of intestinal cells to certain nutritional conditions are often studied by an in vitro approach using intestinal epithelial cell models  <cit> . the human caco- <dig> and ht- <dig> cell lines are commonly used models representing features of the human intestinal epithelium. caco- <dig> cells were derived from a human colon adenocarcinoma, and they differentiate spontaneously in vitro under standard culture conditions thereby exhibiting enterocyte-like structural and functional characteristics  <cit> . in differentiated state, they mimic typical characteristics of the human small intestinal epithelium, like a well-developed brush border with associated enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase and sucrase isomaltase  <cit> . nevertheless, the caco- <dig> cell model is different from the small intestine in several aspects, and their phenotype is dependent on the time in culture  <cit> . the ht- <dig> cell line is also of human colon adenocarcinoma origin, and cannot differentiate spontaneously in vitro under standard conditions, representing undifferentiated colonic epithelial cells  <cit> .

caco- <dig>  ht- <dig> cells, and many other widely used cell lines originate from tumour tissue, which alters the cellular metabolism drastically compared to physiological conditions. therefore, it is difficult to interpret how representative a specific cell line is for the tissue from which it is derived. furthermore, in comparison with the in vivo situation with influences from different neighbouring cells, endocrine regulators and blood flow, the in vitro model is relatively simple. although this is ideal for specific research questions, it complicates the translatability of in vitro results to in vivo situations. above all, it is not clear if cells in culture retain the gene expression profiles of their in vivo counterparts. a study regarding the gene expression patterns in  <dig> human cancer cell lines, including colon cancer cell lines, revealed that the tissue from which the cells are derived is the main factor accounting for the variation in gene expression  <cit> . gene expression was also investigated at a large scale in caco- <dig> and ht- <dig> cells using microarray technology  <cit> . another study revealed novel proteins which were associated with proliferation and differentiation in caco- <dig> cells in relation to colon carcinogenesis  <cit> . however, differentiated caco- <dig> cells, and also ht- <dig> cells are often used to reproduce features of the intestinal epithelium per se. 

a suitable and innovative method to evaluate the validity of such models for the 'normal' epithelium is by investigating similarities and differences in protein expression between cultured intestinal epithelial cells and epithelial scrapings obtained from human intestine. protein isolates of cultured caco- <dig> cells and ht- <dig> were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis  and compared with the 2-de patterns generated from normal epithelium from the small and large intestine. the caco- <dig> cells are very often cultured on permeable supports. this way of culturing polarized cells resembles the in vivo situation more closely, as the cells can take up and secrete molecules on both sides of the monolayer. the supports that were applied in this study were collagen-coated, as this has been shown to promote cell attachment and growth leading to confluence of the caco- <dig> monolayer more rapidly  <cit> . in addition, ultrastructural features of the cell layer were thoroughly investigated in that study and appeared to mimic those of the small intestinal epithelium, which is relevant for a good cell model. as a negative control, protein profiles of the human hep g <dig> hepatoma cell line  and the te  <dig> rhabdomyosarcoma cell line  were used.

RESULTS
protein expression profiles of the intestinal scrapings and cell lines
for each tissue or cell line under study, three replicate gels were made of biological independent samples, except for the large intestinal scrapings, of which only  <dig> independent samples could be obtained. a dendogram  generated by unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the expression data of 2-d patterns revealed that the profiles of the epithelial scrapings of both small and large intestine were separated from those of the cell lines. in the cell line cluster, profiles of cells of epithelial origin  were separated from the profile of cells of mesenchymal origin . differentiated as well as undifferentiated te  <dig> cells were tested, but the 2-d patterns of these cells were similar. the differentiation process induced some obvious protein changes, such as an up-regulation of expression of the spot which contains vimentin. however, overall expression of the undifferentiated and differentiated te  <dig> cells were alike and clustered together in all analyses described below. therefore, only data of the differentiated cells were shown in detail, as the main focus is the behaviour of the intestinal cells.

to get further insight in how 2-d patterns of intestinal caco- <dig> cells  and ht- <dig> cells are related to profiles of small and large intestinal epithelial scrapings, a principal component analysis  was performed. pca allows for grouping of cells with overall similar protein expression characteristics and for identifying proteins which are responsible for the differences between the groups. the plot shown in figure 2a is a simple scatter plot of the first two principal components . pc <dig> and pc <dig> explain  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total variation, respectively. triplicate gels cluster together which indicates that the biological variation is responsible for the clear separation of the different samples. along pc <dig>  three distinct groups are visible, of which one corresponds to all cultured cell lines, independent of tissue origin. in the cluster of the cell lines, three sub-clusters exist along pc <dig> corresponding to profiles from te  <dig> cells, ht- <dig> together with hep g <dig> cells and caco- <dig> cells, independent of their stage of differentiation. when blood-derived proteins are removed from the data set, the pca plot is very similar but pc <dig> explains only  <dig> % of the total variation, largely because profiles of the small and large intestinal cells move closer towards the cell lines along pc <dig>  whereas pc <dig> explains  <dig> % . in addition, removing the blood proteins for generating the dendogram did not influence the branching.

protein data of all in vitro cell cultures were used to generate a set of protein spots , which have the same relative abundance in all types of cell lines studied. these proteins are present in all in vitro cultured cells included in this analysis, and seem not much contributory to the specific phenotype of a certain cell line. therefore, another pca was performed, in which expression data of the 25% proteins common for in vitro cell cultures were subtracted from the data set , so proteins that make a cell line unique contribute more to the overall pattern. the outcome of the analysis, displayed as a scatter plot of pc <dig> and pc <dig>  revealed that protein expression patterns of scrapings and cell lines are still separated . along pc <dig> , the 2-d profiles of the ht- <dig> cells move in the direction of the profiles of the colonic scrapings. along pc <dig>  the profiles of caco- <dig> cells appear at a similar position as those of the small intestinal cells, but this was already visible in figure 2a. along pc <dig> and pc <dig>  the profiles of the te  <dig> cells move further away from the profiles of all other, epithelial cells.

protein expression in the intestinal scrapings and cell lines
in pdquest, 2-d patterns of all protein isolates under study were compared and resulted in  <dig> differentially expressed proteins. in addition,  <dig> protein spots were selected that showed a similar expression pattern in all isolates. out of  <dig> protein spots,  <dig> spots  were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  . identified proteins were grouped in  <dig> clusters according to their expression pattern in the analyzed samples. these clusters of protein spots are shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  in which log-transformed expression values of the biological replicates of different samples are shown in color . the spot numbers correspond to those indicated in figure  <dig>  in this figure, a 2-d pattern of 5-day-differentiated caco- <dig> cells , and a 2-d pattern of a small intestinal epithelial scraping  are shown to give an indication of the overlap of the profiles. the spot numbers of spots which were not present in one of these patterns are indicated in bold, italic. figure  <dig> shows 2-d patterns of large intestinal epithelium, ht- <dig>  hep g <dig> and te  <dig> cells to obtain a general view on the differences and similarities of the protein expression.

cluster  <dig> contains proteins which show a high expression in both intestinal epithelial scrapings relative to the in vitro cell cultures. cluster  <dig> and  <dig> consist of proteins with a high expression level in small and large intestinal scrapings, respectively. proteins with low expression levels in the scrapings are grouped in cluster  <dig>  cluster  <dig> contains proteins with a high expression in all cells of epithelial origin, and cluster  <dig> contains proteins with a low expression in those cells. cluster  <dig> shows proteins with a high expression in all protein isolates of intestinal origin, and protein spots with a high expression in small intestinal epithelium and caco- <dig> cells are shown in cluster  <dig>  cluster  <dig> and  <dig> represent proteins with a high and low expression in caco- <dig> cells, respectively. cluster  <dig> contains proteins mainly expressed in hep g <dig> but with co-expression in other relevant cell types. the last cluster, cluster  <dig> shows proteins with a relatively similar expression level in all protein isolates.

discussion
the current proteomics approach aims to obtain a better insight in the expression patterns of human intestinal epithelial cells and the commonly used in vitro models for these cells, caco- <dig> cells and ht- <dig> cells, both derived of human intestinal adenocarcinoma. this information is highly relevant to researchers using such models, and aiming for translating data to the in vivo situation.

when comparing the 2-d pattern of caco- <dig> cells and small intestinal cells, it becomes apparent that many protein spots are present in both profiles, indicating a great deal of overlap in the type of proteins expressed, supporting the usability of this in vitro model. however, several high abundant proteins in human epithelial cells of the small intestine are not expressed or expressed at low levels in caco- <dig> cells, and vice versa. this might be caused by the transformed status of caco- <dig> cells and an adaptation of their metabolism to growth conditions outside the body. this is supported by the clustering data, which revealed a separation of the epithelial scrapings and all in vitro cell lines, irrespective of their tissue origin, suggesting that the protein expression profiles were quite similar among each of the cell lines, but different from the protein profiles of epithelium in vivo. when exploring the clusters explaining the main variation in expression, noticeably, typical proteins with a high expression in the scrapings are hemoglobin alpha and beta, serum albumin and transthyretin, which appear to originate from blood cells. this finding demonstrates the difficulty of obtaining pure cell isolates, and points to the advantage of using in vitro cell lines, which consist of a homogenous cell population.

several other proteins are responsible for the distinction of the in vitro and in vivo proteomes. first, intestinal fatty-acid binding protein  expression is only observed in the protein profiles of intestinal scrapings, and the expression is highest in small intestinal epithelium. this was observed in another study as well, in which levels were tested at different segments of the human intestinal tract  <cit> . liver fabp is highly expressed in intestinal scrapings, but shows expression in liver hep g <dig> and caco- <dig> cells too. in the latter cells, its expression increases with differentiation, which is in agreement with a previous study  <cit> . another member of the fabp family is cellular retinol-binding protein  ii, which is solely expressed in the small intestinal epithelial scrapings. this vitamin a-binding protein is abundant in the human small intestinal mucosa and is localized to the villus-associated enterocytes by immunohistochemistry  <cit> . in adult rats, expression of cellular rbp ii is restricted to villus-associated enterocytes in the proximal small intestine  <cit> . this protein may be important for intestinal absorption and/or metabolism of retinol. it is also reported in literature that caco- <dig> cells express the protein, and that the expression increases with differentiation  <cit> , but we failed to detect the protein in the profiles of these cells. two proteins involved in fructose metabolism, ketohexokinase and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase b, show a high expression in the small intestine. the latter enzyme is known to be primarily expressed in liver, small intestine, and kidney  <cit> . in hep g <dig> cells, aldolase b mrna was shown to be weakly expressed  <cit> . in comparison, differentiated caco- <dig> cells express fructose-bisphosphate aldolase a and c mrna  <cit> , and recently, we identified isoform a protein in caco- <dig> cells  <cit> . to recapitulate, several proteins with a role in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism are higher expressed, or exclusively expressed in the in vivo intestinal material. this may be a reflection of the intestine's capacity in absorbing and metabolizing complex mixtures of nutrients, whereas in vitro cells are probably adapted to the culture medium with a rather simple composition.

prohibitin is present as two spots in the gels, from which one spot  shows a strong expression whereas the other spot  shows a low expression in the epithelial scrapings, compared to the cultured cells. similarly, two spots were identified as myosin light polypeptide  <dig>  from which one spot is absent in the epithelium in vivo, while the other spot is as abundant as in most cell lines. these data indicate that gene products might be processed via alternative pathways in in vitro cell cultures. next to specific forms of prohibitin and myosin light polypeptide  <dig>  we identified more proteins with a typically higher expression in all cultured cells tested, and they account also for the separation of in vitro and in vivo proteomes. the higher expression levels of proteins discussed below might be explained by the tumoural origin of the in vitro cell lines tested here. heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins  k, l and a2/b <dig> belong to a family of proteins with central roles in dna repair, telomere elongation, cell signalling and in regulating gene expression at transcriptional and translational level. through these key cellular functions, individual hnrnps have a variety of potential roles in tumour development, and several hnrnps, under which hnrnp k and a2/b <dig> are up-regulated in various cancers  <cit> . translationally-controlled tumour protein is also higher expressed in in vitro cultured cells. it is not a tumour-specific protein, although its expression level tends to be higher in tumours, compared to the corresponding normal tissue  <cit> . the protein is highly conserved and widely expressed in all eukaryotic organisms, and is thought to be important for cell growth and division  <cit> . several heat shock proteins , such as 78-kda glucose-regulated protein, 10-kda hsp and 60-kda hsp are also higher expressed in the cell lines. it was demonstrated before that hsps, under which 78-kda glucose-regulated protein, are expressed in increased amounts in many tumours  <cit> . recently, 10-kda hsp was shown to be increased in colorectal cancer tissue compared to normal tissue  <cit> . elevated hsp expression has a cytoprotective role. for example, individual hsps are able to block the pathways of apoptosis, and hence appear to play a role in tumour pathogenesis.

a set of proteins was higher expressed in all cells of epithelial origin included in this analysis. two enzymes with a role in detoxification, monoamine-sulphating phenol sulfotransferase and thiosulfate sulfurtransferase, show such an expression pattern. expression of monoamine-sulphating phenol sulfotransferase was already demonstrated in the human jejunal mucosa and the caco- <dig> cell line  <cit> . thiosulfate sulfurtransferase activity was present in the small intestine, colon and rectum of human  <cit> , but high activity of this enzyme was also shown in liver and kidney of rat  <cit> . annexin a <dig> shows a comparable expression pattern. the protein belongs to a ubiquitous family of ca2+-dependent membrane-binding proteins thought to be involved in membrane trafficking and membrane organization within cells and is found at high levels in many epithelial cells, where it is closely associated with the apical region  <cit> . epithelial cell marker protein  <dig>  also called stratifin or 14-3- <dig> sigma, was also highly expressed in the epithelial cells but was not observed in the mesenchymal te  <dig> cells. these data indicate that caco- <dig> cells as well as ht- <dig> cells express proteins that are characteristic to human intestinal epithelium in vivo, which is further supported by the findings mentioned in next paragraph.

proteins with a higher expression in the intestinal cell lines caco- <dig> and ht- <dig>  and in both the small intestine and colon epithelial scrapings, compared to negative controls hep g <dig> and te  <dig>  are hydroxymethylglutaryl-coa synthase, keratin type  <dig> cytoskeletal  <dig>  and glutathione s-transferase p. these proteins could have an important role in gut epithelial cells, as all profiles of intestinal origin, being from in vitro cultures or scrapings, express them. keratin type  <dig> cytoskeletal  <dig> is such a protein identified as a major cytoskeletal polypeptide of the human intestinal epithelium  <cit> , and is thought to have a role in the intermediate filament organization in intestinal epithelium  <cit> . hydroxymethylglutaryl-coa synthase is a control enzyme in the synthesis of ketone bodies, and is highly expressed in liver and colon, and low in testis, heart, skeletal muscle and kidney  <cit> . expression in the human small intestine is reported here for the first time.

next, caco- <dig> cells share common characteristics with small epithelial scrapings. proteins with a similar expression in both are succinate dehydrogenase, sulfotransferase 1a <dig>  mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, ornithine aminotransferase, and heme-binding protein  <dig>  they can be used as markers for the small intestinal epithelial phenotype of caco- <dig> cells. ornithine aminotransferase appears to be an important protein in the intestine, and is down-regulated by glutamine depletion in caco- <dig> cells and starvation in mouse small intestine  <cit> . this key enzyme is present predominantly in the small intestine and is involved in the conversion of glutamine to ornithine. ornithine is a precursor for polyamines, known for their involvement in cell proliferation, cell differentiation and repair for intestinal cells  <cit> . mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase has an important role in gluconeogenesis, where it catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate. we found that glutamine depletion in caco- <dig> cells resulted in a decreased expression of this protein  <cit> . from above data, one can deduce that the caco- <dig> cells express biologically important proteins at a similar level as in the small intestine. such typical similarities in expression are not observed between caco- <dig> cells and large intestinal scrapings.

proteins with a higher or lower expression in caco- <dig> cells, compared to all other protein isolates, were also observed, and this information needs to be considered when studying processes in which one of these proteins play an important role. mostly, protein expression of partially differentiated caco- <dig> cells equals that of fully differentiated caco- <dig> cells. hep g <dig> cells have the highest plasma rbp levels, which is in line with the liver being the major site for plasma rbp synthesis, where it is secreted in the blood for retinol transport to the peripheral tissues. however, other sites of plasma rbp secretion are reported  <cit> . epithelial scrapings of the small and the large intestine contain this protein as well; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that it is derived from blood. the finding that plasma rbp is expressed at comparable levels in caco- <dig> cells supports the idea that intestinal cells can synthesize the protein too. recently, we have shown that plasma rbp was down-regulated considerably by glutamine deficiency in caco- <dig> cells  <cit> , and this may have relevance for the intestinal condition in vivo. proteins with a role in cytoskeletal function and proteasome activity are present throughout different clusters, which makes it difficult to interpret data concerning these central cellular processes. some proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, namely triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate mutase and alpha enolase are similarly expressed in all samples  tested.

CONCLUSIONS
this study was designed to compare expression profiles of widely used intestinal cell models with their in vivo counterparts. pca revealed that global protein expression of intestinal epithelial scrapings differed considerably with that of intestinal epithelial cell lines. in the cell lines, explicit, highly expressed proteins probably correspond to their tumoural origin, whereas several proteins with a low or undetectable expression could be explained by their adaptation to culture conditions. numerous proteins showed a similar expression in caco- <dig> cells, ht- <dig> cells, and both the intestinal scrapings, of which some appear to be characteristic to human intestinal epithelium in vivo. in addition, several biologically significant proteins are expressed at comparable levels in caco- <dig> cells and small intestinal scrapings, indicating the usability of this in vitro model. caco- <dig> cells, however, appear to over-express as well as under-express certain proteins, which needs to be considered by scientists using this cell line. as a result, care should be taken to prevent misinterpretation of in vitro obtained findings when translating them to the in vivo situation.
