BACKGROUND
the crispr/cas9-system has become an extremely powerful tool for the editing of genes in various cell types. the method was born thanks to the study of clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat -genes and crispr-associated  genes of bacteria, which constitute part of the bacterial defense mechanism  <cit> . as a tool in molecular and cell biology, the crispr/cas9-system is employed by co-expressing a single guide rna , which targets a dna sequence of interest, and the cas <dig> nuclease, which can bind to the grna and produce double-strand breaks . repeated cycles of cut and faulty repair by the cellular non-homologous end joining machinery can eventually generate insertion/deletion  mutations, and consequently a knock-out effect in cases where these mutations introduce a frame-shift within the targeted gene.

by targeting dna, the crispr/cas <dig> system perfectly complements gene knock-down on the rna level by rna interference for the annotation of gene functions  <cit> . importantly, as compared to sirna/shrna technology, phenotyping by gene knock-out is not constrained by a reduction of gene expression that can be incomplete and that can vary from cell to cell. from this perspective, the technique will be particularly useful to screen for gene functions. crispr/cas9-based screens have so far used pooled libraries, in situations where the identification of hits was allowed by the isolation of cells showing the right phenotype . arrayed screens can offer a broader range of phenotyping possibilities  <cit>  which can go up to subtle changes at the cellular scale that can only be observed by microscopy. therefore, combining the pipelines existing for arrayed rnai screens  <cit>  and the crispr/cas9technology should provide a highly sensitive tool to determine gene functions. still, a technical limitation of the crispr/cas9-system is the efficiency of gene knock-out within a cell population, which remains a limiting and highly variable factor. for example, the first studies validating the crispr approach for mammalian cells demonstrated proportions of gene-edited cellular subpopulations ranging between  <dig> and 25 %, depending on the cell type and the mode of cas9/grna transfection  <cit> . two main strategies have improved the efficiency, the first being the optimization of the delivery method, using e.g. lentiviral, adenoviral or adeno-associated viral  vectors  <cit> . lentivirus libraries have successfully been used for various screening projects  and aavs have been applied in animals . potential drawbacks of this viral vector strategy are the requirement to work under elevated biosafety levels , the stable chromosomal integration of the viral genomes encoding the cas <dig> nuclease , or the limited capacity for packaging of foreign dna such as cas <dig> cdnas . the other strategy consists of selecting, enriching and expanding cells from a cell population by using co-expressing markers  <cit> , as briefly summarized in the following. co-expression of fluorescent proteins  <cit>  or of reporter plasmids exhibiting fluorescent protein expression after editing of the reporter gene  <cit>  allows for easy and robust selection by flow cytometry sorting. nevertheless, its application in arrayed screens would be laborious. another selection strategy that is more amenable for a screening strategy consists of killing cells that are not expressing cas <dig>  this was performed either by co-expressing cas <dig> and a gene that provides resistance to a drug  <cit>  or by co-editing a gene of interest and a gene that would induce cell death upon treatment with a drug. this last approach was performed by targeting the hprt gene and by using 6-tg as death inducer  <cit> . the fluorescence- and drug-based approaches have the advantage of relying on transient expression of cas <dig>  and therefore can be considered as scarless: the only genome modification that is left after the transient expression is the editing event itself, but no cas9/grna insertion or acquired drug resistance. regarding the selection by cell killing, the process should occur within two days, during the typical peak of expression of the resistance gene. for this reason, puromycin is typically preferred to other drugs as it generally kills cells within  <dig> to 48 h. provided a good balance between killing of non-transfected cells and survival of transfected cells, one can yield efficient genome editing even in the case of suboptimal transfection with limited cost and material.

here, we aimed at enlarging the panel of tools for potent and fast enrichment of gene-edited cells, and thus implemented an original strategy based on killing of transfected cells that lack cas <dig> expression through the extrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway. the activation of the tnf receptor family members fas/cd <dig> by cd <dig> ligand , or dr <dig> and dr <dig> by trail, can induce cell death in many cellular contexts through the activation of caspases . this activation occurs through the recruitment of the adaptor protein fadd on the death domain  of oligomerized, ligand-associated receptors  <cit> . because of this oligomerization step, receptor mutants that lack the dd can block apoptosis even in the presence of wild type  receptors, in a dominant-negative manner  <cit> . we therefore hypothesized that co-expression of the cas <dig> nuclease with such receptor mutants would render cells resistant to cd95l- or trail-induced apoptosis, and that incubation with the appropriate ligand would allow for the enrichment of cas9-positive cells with no further modification of the cells. in vitro, killing cells can be efficiently achieved by using modified forms of soluble cd <dig> and trail ligands that are, for example, fused to an isoleucine zipper  <cit> . ligands can be produced in-house in a straightforward and inexpensive manner, do not require purification and kill cells within a few hours.

for proof-of-concept, we successfully applied our method to the p <dig> subunit of nfκb, irf <dig> and tlr <dig>  using three different grnas per gene. by using the t7e <dig> assay and sanger sequencing, we obtained estimations of up to 100 % gene-edited cells. as a result of this enrichment, we could directly show the involvement of the three genes in poly -induced cell death in hela cells. moreover, we observed that a given grna generated a reproducible indel pattern in different cell lines. this pattern showed a limited complexity, which had a strong influence on the calculation of editing efficiency from the t7e <dig> assay. we conclude that our strategy extends the panel of tools for the crispr/cas <dig> technology and can be particularly applicable to screens as it is easy to implement and reduces the time for the selection of gene-edited cells.

RESULTS
death receptor-based selection of cas9-expressing cells
we established a death receptor-based selection system that enriches cas9-expressing cells in order to generate polyclonal, gene-edited cell populations. to this end, we designed a single plasmid encoding grna and cas <dig> nuclease together with the selection gene that is co-expressed via a 2a peptide, adapted from  <cit>  . using death ligands as selection agent, we aimed at killing non-transfected cells and cells expressing too low levels of cas <dig> nuclease. as selection genes, we used truncations of death receptors that are unable to transmit the apoptotic signal . more precisely, we made truncated receptors missing their death domain  for the death ligand cd <dig> ligand  or trail  . we tested their single expression as well as the simultaneous expression of both, dr4-Δdd and dr5-Δdd, or even of all three mutant receptors, cd95-Δdd, dr4-Δdd and dr5-Δdd, from the same construct. as detected by immunofluorescence, all our vectors robustly over-expressed the mutant receptors in the different cell lines that were tested, hela, ht- <dig>  ln- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> .fig.  <dig> constructs and workflow of death receptor-based enrichment of cas9-expressing cells. a constructs for different selection strategies. the cas <dig> nuclease is linked to the resistance gene by a cleavable 2a peptide allowing stoichiometric expression. as resistance gene, we used death receptors that lack the intracellular death domain, denoted by ∆. cd <dig> is chosen when using cd95l as selection agent. dr <dig> and dr <dig> are death receptors that bind the death ligand trail. to allow simultaneous expression of several death receptors, we linked them to cas <dig> via the 2a peptide from thosea asigna virus , from foot-and-mouth disease virus  and porcine teschovirus- <dig> . to allow comparison to the puromycin selection strategy, we cloned the puromycin resistance gene puromycin n-acetyl-transferase, denoted here as puro. we used the human cytomegalovirus  and the 7sk promoters for the protein and grna expression, respectively. b workflow. cells are transfected with a plasmid encoding the cas <dig> nuclease, a selection gene and the grna. two days after transfection, death ligand was added to the cells, before they were washed and expanded



as we aimed at developing a strategy that would minimize the requirements for production of reagents, we next tested the possibility to directly use secreted, non-purified ligands expressed in hek 293 t cells. we measured the apoptotic activity of soluble death ligands  that are fused to the isoleucine-zippper domain , denoted as izscd95l and izstrail, in different human cell lines : hela, ht- <dig>  ln- <dig>  mda-mb- <dig>  hepg <dig>  mcf10a and a <dig> . with the exception of a <dig>  all cell lines showed more than 99 % cell death within 5 h with at least one of the ligands. remarkably, 1 h was even sufficient to kill hela and hepg <dig> cells. addition of  <dig> or 50 μg/μl cycloheximide, known to amplify the sensitivity to death receptors  <cit> , could further enhance cell death in some cases. still, in all cells except a <dig>  one of the two ligands efficiently induced cell death without cycloheximide , showing that those ligands can be directly used as strong selection agent. notably, cell death induced by puromycin, even at saturating concentrations, required about 30 hours to kill more than 99 % hela, ln- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells . therefore, cell death can be more efficiently induced by death ligands than by puromycin.fig.  <dig> death ligands induce cell death in various cell types within a few hours. cell death was measured by observing cell morphology by microscopy. a cell death kinetics of a <dig>  hepg <dig> and hela cells using izstrail and izscd95l, with and without co-treatment with  <dig> to 50 μg/ml cycloheximide . b cell death of ln- <dig>  ht- <dig>  mda-mb- <dig> and mcf10a cells treated for 5 h with izscd95l  or izstrail , with or without 5 μg/ml chx. c hela cell death kinetics comparison between izscd95l and puromycin. while cell death occurred after 2 h with izscd95l, it saturated at 30 h with puromycin. b and c: mean ± s.d. of  <dig> different fields of view with at least  <dig> cells each



estimating genome editing efficiency in hela cells by sanger sequencing and t7e <dig> assay
in order to test the capacity of our death receptor strategy to efficiently generate gene-edited cells, we targeted three different genes in hela cells, irf <dig>  tlr <dig> and p <dig>  with three different grnas for each gene. as cd95l killed hela cells more efficiently than trail , we used the cas9-2a-cd95Δdd construct. as mock control, we used a grna that was designed to target gfp . two days after transfection, cells were incubated for 5 h with izscd95l. we also kept cells transfected with tlr <dig> grna- <dig> untreated, denoted as tlr <dig> grna-1*. seven days after treatment, genomic dna was extracted for analysis and the remaining cells were kept in culture for direct phenotyping. we evaluated the editing efficiency, denoting the fraction of mutant dna species, by using two different methods, namely the analysis of sanger sequence chromatograms  and the t7e <dig> assay . to quantify the mutations from sequencing chromatograms, we applied the tide  analysis, a sequence decomposition approach  <cit> . to this end, we pcr-amplified the genomic region targeted by the different grnas in the polyclonal hela cell lines. the three grnas for one gene were located in the same region of the genome, hence we used the same primers for each gene. to check the consistency of the indel calculation, we sequenced each pcr product from both sides of the cut . in all cases, sequencing chromatograms already provided a clear visual impression of the presence of genetic modifications, mostly evidenced by a unique sequence before the cutting site and a mixture of sequences behind it . in some cases, a small amount of mutated sequences was also detected before this cutting site, which likely corresponds to large indels that start after the sequencing primer . strikingly, in cell lines enriched for irf <dig> and p <dig> cleavage, no wt sequence of the respective genes was detected , while the amount of wt tlr <dig> sequence was  <dig> to 36 %. in contrast, no indels were identified in non-enriched tlr <dig> grna-1* cells or in enriched gfp grna control cells . therefore, this first approach indicated efficient enrichment of gene-edited cells. interestingly, the mutation pattern was different for each tested grna and appeared to be of limited complexity, with a total of  <dig> to  <dig> indels for each grna . this number may reflect a detection limit of the sequencing/tide approach. nevertheless, as evidenced by the ranked frequency of indels, in most cases few indels represented the highest proportion of mutations .table  <dig> sequence of single guide rna , forward and reverse pcr primers , and primers used for sequencing

using the t7e <dig> assay, we obtained fractions of cleaved pcr product  ranging between  <dig> and 90 % . in contrast to the sequencing results, cells that were not treated with izscd95l still showed 41 % cleavage. the editing efficiency is typically calculated from the fraction of cleaved pcr products as follows  <cit> :  <dig> editingefficiency=1−1−fractioncleaved 

following this estimation, we obtained editing efficiencies ranging between  <dig> and 70 % for cells treated with izscd95l and 23 % for non-selected cells . thus, both approaches verified successful editing and enrichment of cells. yet, they showed a large discrepancy in the editing efficiency for enriched cells, reaching up to 100 % for the sequencing approach versus up to 70 % for the t7e <dig> approach. in contrast, non-enriched cells showed 0 % editing by sequencing but 23 % by the t7e <dig> approach . these discrepancies led us to revisit the estimation of the editing efficiency. on the one hand, the sanger sequencing might not be sensitive enough to detect a low fraction of mutant dna species in the non-enriched sample, and vice versa, to detect a low amount of wt sequences in the enriched samples. on the other hand, the editing efficiency calculated using equation  relies on the assumption that the diversity of mutated strands is sufficiently large so that those mutated strands never reanneal with strands carrying the same mutation  <cit> . in other terms, only the wt strands would form homoduplexes and would remain uncleaved by the endonuclease. as we identified a low diversity of indels by sequencing, this questioned the validity of the aforementioned assumption. in order to test it, we calculated the expected cleavage fraction in an endonuclease assay by assuming that not only wt but also mutant homoduplexes can form. as explained in the additional file 1: supplemental note, this can be expressed as follows:  <dig> fractioncleaved≈fractionheteroduplex=1−∑i=1mpj <dig> where m is the number of possible sequences, with m- <dig> mutants and one wt, and pj is the relative amount of each of the sequences. as explained in more detail and exemplified in additional file  <dig>  this calculation shows that the cleavage fraction would not reach 100 % even when no wt sequence is present . it also shows that for an editing efficiency below 30 %, the original equation  is particularly appropriate  while for high editing efficiencies it becomes unsuitable.

to test the relevance of this calculation in practice, we hypothesized that the measured frequency of indels by the tide analysis mirrors the likelihood to obtain a mutation for a particular grna. therefore, we applied equation  using the frequencies shown in fig. 3a to derive the expected cleavage fraction in a t7e <dig> assay. strikingly, the resulting predictions  were in good agreement with the measured cleavage fractions . we also estimated the endonuclease-mediated cleavage depending on varying amount of wt sequence . by this means, we observed that the cleavage fraction cannot exceed 70 % to 90 % depending on the grna. thus, the sensitivity of the sanger sequencing and the aforementioned limitations of the interpretation of the t7e <dig> assay might readily explain the discrepancies in the estimation of the editing efficiency. importantly, irrespective of the true editing efficiency, both approaches confirmed a strong enrichment of gene-edited cells when using cd95-induced apoptosis as selection strategy.

phenotyping of gene knock-out effects after death receptor-based enrichment
as a proof-of-concept, we used the different hela cell lines for a direct phenotyping of introduced gene mutations. specifically, we were interested in the role of p <dig>  irf <dig> and tlr <dig> in double-stranded rna-induced apoptosis. some previous studies reported the requirement of transcriptional activity through p <dig> and/or irf <dig> for this type of death , while others showed the possibility of direct cell death through the formation of the ripoptosome on activated tlr <dig>  <cit> . notably, this cell death response typically only occurred in a fraction of the cell population  <cit> . to investigate the role of the three genes in dsrna-induced death in hela cells, we quantified the death response of edited cells after poly  treatment by flow cytometry. using wt hela cells and gfp grna-treated cells as controls, we obtained a cell death of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %, respectively. interestingly, in p <dig>  irf <dig> and tlr <dig> gene-edited cell lines, the cell death response was strongly reduced, ranging between  <dig>  ±  <dig>  with tlr <dig> grna- <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % with p <dig> grna- <dig> . notably, still  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of non-enriched tlr <dig> grna-1* cells were killed by poly  treatment. together, this emphasizes that the three genes are involved in this type of death and that enrichment of gene-edited cells helps to directly assess the associated cellular phenotype.fig.  <dig> poly -induced cell death is reduced in cells with impaired tlr <dig>  irf <dig> and p <dig> expression.  <dig> h after transfection of 2 μg/ml poly  with dotap, fractional cell death was measured by flow cytometry using propidium iodide. we compared wt hela cells and polyclonal hela cell lines generated with the nine different grnas targeting tlr <dig>  irf <dig> and p <dig> genes and the control grna targeting gfp. tlr <dig> grna- <dig> cells denoted with a star  were not treated with izscd95l, while ctr. denotes hela wt cells transfected with a non-triphosphate 19-mer rna control to account for cell death due to transfection with dotap. shown are means ± s.e.m. of  <dig> independent experiments



comparison of cell enrichment by death receptors versus puromycin
finally, we compared the gene editing efficiency in hela, ht- <dig> and ln- <dig> cells when using the death receptor-based versus the puromycin-based selection approach. for this, we targeted the gene irf <dig> using grna- <dig> either with the cas9–2a-cd95Δdd plasmid used above, as cd95l was most potent to kill those cell lines, or with the cas9–2a-puro plasmid . two days after transfection with cas9–2a-cd95Δdd, cells were incubated with izscd95l for 5 h or left untreated. hela, ht- <dig> and ln- <dig> cells transfected with cas9–2a-puro were treated for 30 h with  <dig>   <dig> and 5 μg/ml puromycin, respectively, or left untreated. the concentrations were chosen to ensure a complete killing of the cells . cells were then maintained in culture until the density of all treated cells allowed their characterization, between  <dig> and 11 days post-transfection.

as assessed by the tide analysis of sequenced pcr products, we obtained different efficiencies depending on the cell type and the selection strategy . for each condition, the fraction of indels was calculated by dividing their amount by the amount of wt and indel sequences . for death receptor-enriched cells, the fraction of indels in ht- <dig> cells was  <dig> and 94 %, in ln- <dig> cells  <dig> and 25 %, and in hela cells  <dig> and 100 %, respectively, in two biological replicates each. for puromycin-enriched cells, ht- <dig> cells showed 100 % indels, ln- <dig> cells  <dig> and 65 %, and hela cells  <dig> and 73 %. in contrast, in non-enriched transfected cells, indels were detected only in one replicate of ln- <dig> cells transfected with cas9–2a-puro , in hela cells with cas9–2a-puro , and in hela cells with cas9–2a-cd95Δdd  . as expected, enriched and transfected control cells  displayed only wt sequences . finally, western blotting confirmed the different observed efficiencies at the protein level, with equal efficiencies for both strategies in ht- <dig> cells, a slight advantage for puromycin-selected ln- <dig> cells, and better efficiencies for death receptor-selected hela cells . notably, as in the pilot experiment , we found the frequent deletion of  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides as well as insertion of  <dig> nucleotide with this grna . remarkably, in each cell line and in each replicate, their relative frequency was similar .fig.  <dig> death receptor-based and puromycin-based enrichment of cas9-expressing cells. in two independent experiments, ht- <dig>  ln- <dig> and hela cells were transfected with plasmid cas9-2a-cd95∆dd or cas9-2a-puro encoding grna- <dig> targeting the irf <dig> gene or grna targeting gfp. cell lines were tested against wild type cells for presence of indels in the gene irf <dig> using primer irf <dig> p <dig> . indels were detected by sanger sequencing and tide analysis. a selection using izscd95l or 5 μg/ml puromycin treatment. b no selection. c

discussion
the crispr/cas <dig> technology allows for the study of gene function through targeted dna modification. in principle, it permits the investigation of cellular networks with a greater sensitivity than with rna interference approaches where gene expression reduction is only partial. however, this sensitivity can be tempered by the limited delivery efficiency of cas <dig> and the grna  <cit> . different strategies were employed to increase the percentage of cas9-expressing or gene-edited cells: isolation of single cells to generate monoclonal cell lines or generation of polyclonal cells by enriching cas9-expressing cells through gfp fluorescence or antibiotics like puromycin  <cit>  or magnetic bead isolation of receptor-overexpressing cells  <cit> . in this work, we extended this panel of options with the death receptor-based cas <dig> selection strategy. similar to antibiotics-based selection, our new strategy does not require any transfer of the cells during the selection process. moreover, our method can be applied in cell lines that already stably express resistance genes. importantly, while the selection efficiency matches the one obtained with puromycin, the death receptor-based method minimizes the time required for the selection. finally, it can be used in laboratories with no capacity to sort cells or to produce viruses. one drawback is the applicability to cells that are fully death ligand-sensitive. this is for example not the case for induced pluripotent stem cells  <cit> , and testing of the effect of the ligand on cells of interest should be the first step to be performed. however, the production of the death ligand can be easily accomplished in the laboratory, does not require protein purification and is inexpensive.

thus far, the crispr/cas <dig> technology has been applied to pooled genomic screens, where upon negative or positive selection, gene hits are identified by sequencing of the stably integrated grna  <cit> . we envision a major application of our death receptor-based enrichment strategy in arrayed screens, where, as an alternative option to antibiotic-based enrichment, it should increase the sensitivity of phenotyping. in this context, cell transfection, selection, washing and expansion could be implemented in the same plate prior to phenotyping. hence, existing pipelines for arrayed rnai screens could be easily adapted  <cit> . parameters to be optimized would be the cell number to be plated and the time for their expansion, so that the cell density allows for phenotyping. here, we have exemplarily shown the involvement of three genes in poly -induced cell death in hela cells, and we plan to use this array approach to identify additional genes involved in this as well as other pathways induced by dsrna. notably, thanks to the power of the enrichment approach, optimization of the transfection efficiency was not required.

in order to quantify the efficiency of gene editing by the crispr/cas <dig> method, we employed and compared the t7e <dig> assay and the tide analysis  <cit> . although both approaches yielded congruent results on the enrichment of gene editing after death receptor-mediated cell killing, they generated significantly different outputs for the editing efficiency. as explained in the results and in the additional file 1: supplemental note, the estimate of the editing efficiency calculated from an endonuclease assay result is strongly dependent on the underlying assumptions. while equation  relies on the postulation that mutated strands cannot anneal with strands carrying the same mutation due to a hypothetically large diversity of indels, the more general equation  shows that equation  is actually only valid under two conditions: low editing efficiency and/or very large diversity of indels all exhibiting low probabilities. in this work, we obtained high editing efficiencies, with mostly few indels representing the majority of mutations . hence, equation  should be more appropriate compared to equation  traditionally used to assess genome editing efficiency. confirming its relevance, the symmetric parabolic shape obtained from this equation with the most extreme case of one possible indel  has been observed in an in vitro experiment that mimics this situation  <cit> . simulation of such situations led to several conclusions that are of general interest when interpreting the cleavage fraction  from the t7e <dig> or surveyor assay to determine editing efficiency:one cannot reach a 100 % cleavage fraction with the t7e <dig> assay, even in perfect technical setups.

due to the parabolic shape of equation , within a certain range, two possible editing efficiencies can be assigned to one cleavage fraction .

the maximal cleavage fraction does not correspond to the maximal editing efficiency.

although equation  is universal, its coefficients depend on the indel pattern, not known a priori.

when editing efficiency is high, the sensitivity of the t7e <dig> assay to detect changes in this efficiency is particularly poor. although this effect can also be seen for equation  for high editing efficiencies, it becomes even stronger when one takes into account the limited diversity of indels with equation  .

for a low editing efficiency, the relationship between cleavage and efficiency is reasonably independent of the indel pattern, and the t7e <dig> assay is particularly sensitive . therefore, comparison of different grnas, which generate different patterns, should be performed under conditions with more than 70 % wt sequence.



on top of these theoretical considerations, one should mention that the t7e <dig> and surveyor assays are likely unable to generate a complete cleavage of duplexes. a direct comparison of both assays indicated a maximum of  <dig> and 60 % cleavage of heteroduplexes with the t7e <dig> and surveyor assays, respectively  <cit> . in this work, by taking into account the different indels that were identified from the tide analysis for the distinct grnas used in this study, we observed that the range of cleaved fraction using the t7e <dig> assay, between  <dig> and 90 %, was theoretically compatible with a 100 % editing efficiency. in practice, however, this means that when large amounts of cleaved pcr products are observed by t7e <dig>  a precise estimation of editing efficiency using this assay cannot be expected.

overall, the sequencing approach provided not only information on editing efficiency, but also interesting information on the type and relative amount of indels. since the indel pattern using irf <dig> grna- <dig> was reproduced in different cell lines and experiments, our data strengthen the notion that the type of indel is governed by the choice of the grna sequence. moreover, as irf <dig> grna- <dig> and grna- <dig> were only shifted by  <dig> nucleotide but showed a very different indel pattern, the cutting position is likely to have a strong influence on this pattern. dna repair studies suggest that this pattern is driven by the presence of microhomology sequences on both sides of the cut. such sequences of  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides can influence the repair by non-homologous end joining  <cit> , while larger ones may lead to microhomology-mediated end joining even if they are further apart from the cutting site . a closer examination of the grna sequences  allowed to identify three microhomology domains that may explain prominent peaks for deletion of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides for tlr <dig> grna- <dig>  irf <dig> grna- <dig> and p <dig> grna- <dig>  respectively. the use of computer tools that predict indels using microhomology sequences like the one presented in reference  <cit>  should therefore help to design grnas that generate interesting indel patterns.

CONCLUSIONS
our work demonstrates the usefulness of death receptors as tool for the selection of cas9-expressing cells. killing non-transfected cells with death ligands can trigger enrichment of gene-edited cells that allows for direct assessment of gene function. the here presented extension of the tool panel based on the crispr/cas <dig> technology will particularly enhance low- and high-throughput phenotyping screening after crispr-mediated gene knockdown.
