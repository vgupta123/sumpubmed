BACKGROUND
transcription factors  play a decisive role in regulatory gene networks. by interacting with specific dna-binding elements  transcriptional activation of targeted genes can be initiated. the expression and/or activity of tfs may be regulated in a cell type- or tissue-specific or in a cell cycle-dependent manner and can be changed by different environmental influences  <cit> . some tfs regulate their own transcription in a feed-back loop  <cit> .

a well-understood ligand-activated nuclear transcription factor is aryl hydrocarbon receptor   <cit> . prior to activation through a variety of toxins such as  <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, combustion products, and numerous phytochemicals including flavonoids and indole-3-carbinol , ahr is found in the cytosol in association with heat shock protein hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> accessory proteins. ligand binding releases these proteins from their complex and promotes nuclear translocation. in the nucleus, the ligand-activated ahr forms a heterodimeric complex with aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator   <cit> . the complex binds to aryl hydrocarbon response elements  – also known as xenobiotic response elements  and dioxin response elements  -, which function as cis-acting enhancers in the regulatory domains of targeted genes, some of which are collectively known as the ahr gene battery  <cit> . negative regulation of gene expression through ahr signaling is also known  <cit> , but the mechanisms by which different genes are either induced or repressed after binding of activated ahr to cognate recognition sites in gene promoters remains uncertain. this is of particular importance, as ligands of ahr elicit a broad spectrum of biochemical and toxicological effects including teratogenesis, immunosuppression due to thymic involution, and tumor promotion  <cit> .

the importance of ahr in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis has, however, only just begun to be realized  <cit> , and there is evidence for ahr to be directly involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes participating in cell cycle regulation  <cit> .

the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous substrates by p <dig> enzymes  has been shown to cause reactive oxygenated metabolite -mediated oxidative stress. oxidative stress is a major signal in triggering apoptosis; however, the precise mechanism, or molecules, determining the cell's decision for either apoptosis or continuation of the cell cycle remains to be elucidated.

furthermore, the importance of the chromosomal localization of genes with respect to transcriptional regulation has also just begun to be realized. many co-expressed, non-homologous genes are known to be clustered on chromosomes, implying their co-regulation. the positional clustering of co-expressed genes is common in prokaryotes  and was recently described for saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , caenorabditis elegans  <cit>  and drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . throughout the human genome, it is often supposed that genes are randomly distributed, except for tandem duplicates. however, chromosomal domains of highly expressed genes have recently been revealed in the human genome as well  <cit> .

here, we used high-density oligonucleotide and cdna microarray technology to analyze transcript signatures of aroclor 1254-treated human hepatocytes. for the assignment of biological processes involving the aroclor 1254-regulated genes, the goffa library was used, which is part of the public toxicogenomics software for microarray data management and analysis, e.g. arraytrack  <cit> . this library provides gene ontology information using the standard vocabulary  of the gene ontology consortium. specifically, we searched for novel transcription factors for an improved understanding of the regulatory gene network modulated by aroclor  <dig>  next to an identification of ahr binding sites in regulated genes, we searched for additional tfs binding sites as to determine combinatorial interactions and to determine the reason for the level of genes being either induced or repressed. we also examined the chromosomal distribution of aroclor 1254-regulated genes to test for our hypothesis of transcriptional regulation of co-localized genes on the basis of regulation of neighborhood genes which are not bona fide targets of ahr but are targets of other regulated tfs. therefore we report molecular rules for transcriptional regulation of targeted genes to explain in part the pleiotropic effect observed in animals and humans upon exposure to aroclor  <dig> 

RESULTS
analysis of high-density oligonucleotide microarray data
we used rna from control and aroclor 1254-treated hepatocyte cultures oligonucleotide microarrays. the complete data have been deposited in ncbis gene expression omnibus   <cit>  and are accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig>  the experiment revealed that  <dig> genes were regulated by aroclor  <dig>  aroclor  <dig> treatment resulted in increased expression of  <dig> genes , and repressed expression of  <dig> genes , as compared to controls. ahr activation by components of aroclor  <dig> was also confirmed by gene expression profiling with cdna arrays. here, the expression ratio of cyp1a <dig> was  <dig> , the expression ratio of cyp1a <dig> was  <dig>  and the expression ratio of ugt1a <dig> was  <dig>  as compared to controls. further, ahr activation by components of aroclor  <dig> was confirmed by cyp1a <dig> western blotting experiments and by determining erod enzyme activity . we found cyp1a <dig> protein expression and enzyme activity to be clearly induced in cultures of human hepatocytes after incubation with aroclor  <dig>  these data provide conclusive evidence for activation of ahr in cultures of human hepatocytes treated with aroclor  <dig> 

cellular roles of aroclor 1254-regulated genes
to assign the biological processes involving the aroclor 1254-regulated genes, we used the goffa library, which is a part of the public toxicogenomics software for microarray data management and analysis arraytrack  <cit> . this library provides gene ontology information, using the standard vocabulary  of the gene ontology consortium. we focused only on some particular biological processes, as depicted in figure  <dig>  and separately assigned the number of aroclor 1254-induced and aroclor 1254-repressed genes which are involved in these processes. corresponding to the number of biological processes a particular gene is involved in, this gene can appear in different processes. comparison of induced and repressed genes' involvement in the different biological processes  demonstrates that there was preponderance for aroclor 1254-induced genes to be involved more often in the gene/protein expression machinery, in the intracellular signal cascade and in development, whereas repressed genes were more often involved in immune response and cell adhesion. this result reflects the reaction of the cells to the changes of environmental influences, here especially the influence of the mixture of xenobiotics .

aroclor 1254-regulated expression of transcription factors and genes involved in regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis
we focused on genes coding for transcription factors in order to elucidate the regulatory gene network induced by treatment of human hepatocytes with aroclor  <dig>  we further focused on genes coding for regulators of cell cycle and apoptosis , even though only limited information on the specific role of ahr is available  <cit> .

 <dig> out of  <dig> genes which are induced by aroclor  <dig> treatment are transcription factors . many of these transcription factors are stress-induced and transcriptional regulate genes which are involved in apoptosis, cell cycle, development, morphogenesis, and oncogenesis as described in additional file 2a.  <dig> out of  <dig> genes which are induced by aroclor  <dig> treatment are especially involved in regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. additional file 2a depicts their entrez gene identifier and their signal ratio and furthermore the classification and function of these transcription factors. we also identified  <dig> out of  <dig> genes which are repressed as transcription factors by aroclor  <dig> treatment  and  <dig> genes which are especially involved in regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. they are listed in additional file 2b, including their entrez gene identifier and signal ratio. moreover, this table depicts the classification and function of the transcription factors. many of these transcription factors are transcriptional repressors and are involved in the regulation of genes which play a role in cell cycle, development and oncogenesis.

promoter sequence analysis of aroclor 1254-regulated transcription factors and of genes involved in regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis
after identification of the aroclor 1254-regulated transcription factors and genes involved in regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis, we extracted their promoters from public databases and analyzed them in respect of ahr binding sites. for this purpose, we used a matrix which we had recently constructed   <cit> . as controls, we used promoters of randomly selected genes from the microarray which were not influenced by aroclor 1254-treatment . two different cut-off values, qcut-off =  <dig>  and qcut-off =  <dig> , were chosen for computational analysis. we applied two different cut-offs in order to test for an increase of the fold occurrences by using the more stringent cut-off value . this would be a conformation for the specificity of the matrix used . the numbers of ahr binding sites in the promoters of aroclor 1254-regulated transcription factors are given in additional file 2a and additional file 2b, respectively, whereas the numbers of ahr binding sites in promoters of unregulated genes are listed in additional file  <dig> 

the calculated fold occurrences of ahr sites in the analyzed gene promoters are given in table  <dig>  they describe the number of ahr binding sites detected as a ratio with regard to the number of gene promoters analyzed. here, the fold occurrence of the unregulated gene promoters is set to  <dig>  using the lower cut-off value of  <dig> , the fold occurrences of the ahr sites of the analyzed promoters of one group in total are clearly increased in comparison to the fold occurrences of the ahr sites of the control gene promoters in total, with the exception of aroclor 1254-induced genes involved in apoptosis. however, using the more stringent matrix similarity cut-off value of  <dig> , the fold occurrences of the ahr sites in the promoters of all aroclor 1254-regulated genes including genes involved in apoptosis is clearly increased as compared to promoters of unregulated genes. this result once more confirms the specificity of the ahr matrix used and is an indication for a direct regulation by ahr of many of the genes analyzed.

in order to prove whether ares/epres , which belong to an ahr-independent chemoprotective response system, also play a role in regulation of the analyzed promoters, we constructed an are weight matrix using functional are-dna sequences  <cit> . further, we applied this are matrix to analyze all extracted promoters of aroclor 1254-regulated genes . no are could be detected . as positive control for the matrix we used the rat gst-ya gene promoter, which contains several are recognition sites .

common frameworks in the promoters of aroclor 1254-regulated genes
we used the genomatix software frameworker to extract a common framework consisting of different transcription factor recognition sequences proximal to ahr. this tool is designed for the comparative analysis of promoter sequences. frameworker returns the most complex models that are common to the input sequences. these are all elements that occur in the same order and in a certain distance range in all  the input sequences. here, we aimed to identify further transcription factor binding sites next to that one of the ahr in order to determine rules for ahr-mediated transcriptional regulation in response to the treatment of human hepatocytes with aroclor  <dig>  we further whished to identify differences between aroclor 1254-induced and -repressed promoters. because positive as well as negative regulation of gene expression through ahr signaling is known, but the mechanisms by which different genes are either induced or repressed after binding of activated ahr to cognate recognition sites in gene promoters remains uncertain.

for this purpose we analysed aroclor 1254-induced and repressed promoters separately. the results are shown in table  <dig>  besides at least one ahr binding site, all aroclor 1254-regulated gene promoters  were defined by ets and sp <dig> binding sites. all aroclor 1254-repressed gene promoters additionally contained e2f binding sites. furthermore, at least 90% of all analysed aroclor 1254-regulated gene promoters, contained creb, egr, zbp, nf-kappab, and nkxh binding sites. notably, 90% of the aroclor 1254-induced gene promoters were positive for ecat and tbp, whereas 90% of the aroclor 1254-repressed genes contained maz, hox, and whz binding sites. thus, aroclor 1254-induced and -repressed genes could be distinguished on the basis of combinatory rules for transcription factor recognition sequences. as control we analysed the promoters of genes which were not regulated by aroclor  <dig> at all  by using the frameworker.  <dig> % of these promoters were positive for binding sites of only one single transcription factor: ets. no model with at least  <dig> elements was found .

chromosomal localization of aroclor 1254-regulated genes
for  <dig> out of  <dig> up-regulated genes and for  <dig> out of  <dig> repressed genes the chromosomal localization could be determined. the relative distribution of aroclor 1254-regulated genes on the different chromosomes showed no marked under- or overrepresentation for particular chromosomes as compared to the distribution of all genes of the genome mapped so far  .

next, the distribution of aroclor 1254-regulated genes on the single chromosomes was delineated graphically. the distribution of aroclor 1254-regulated genes on the chromosomes in comparison with the distribution of all genes mapped so far is shown in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  these graphs provide the visual impression that many aroclor 1254-regulated genes are co-localized in proximal neighborhood and they seem to form clusters within chromosomal regions. however, it is known that genes in general are not uniformly distributed in the genome, as shown in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in order to answer the question as to whether aroclor 1254-regulated genes are statistically significant co-localized along the chromosomes, we calculated specifically the probability by which aroclor 1254-regulated genes occur within dna windows of different sizes as compared to the probability of all known mapped  <dig>  genes  of the human genome to occur within the same dna windows. the results of this analysis are depicted in table  <dig>  the numbers of observed pairs of aroclor 1254-regulated genes in the different window sizes used and the mean of the numbers of pairs of genes stemming from the  <dig> random lists in the different window sizes used are listed in table  <dig>  in this table also the standard deviations of the mean values of the random lists are given, as well as the significances , which express the possibility by which such a result would appear by chance. the significance was calculated by using the binominal distribution. table  <dig> depicts the over-representation of co-localized gene pairs within the window sizes >0– <dig>  >50– <dig> and >100– <dig> kbp. these results are shown to be statistically highly significant . thus, genes which were regulated by aroclor  <dig> are much closer located to each other than genes distributed randomly all over the genome. refseq transcripts which possess the same start site of transcription and thus being alternatively spliced transcripts are included only one time in the window size of  <dig> kbp. the other was skipped from the analysis. next, we analysed whether the identified aroclor 1254-regulated gene pairs are directly neighbored . indeed, we found  <dig> gene pairs to be directly neighbored on the chromosomes. the distances of the transcription start sites of these directly neighbored gene pairs range from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb. strikingly, the size of chromatin domains, which are the units of transcriptional competences, varies from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb  <cit> . a detailed description of the  <dig> directly neighbored gene pairs is shown in additional file  <dig> 

in order to explore whether aroclor 1254-regulated transcription factors  also play a role in the indirect regulation of genes being directly neighbored, we used the corresponding available weight matrices from the database transfac® professional rel.  <dig>  for the analysis of all extracted promoters  of aroclor 1254-regulated directly neighbored genes . unfortunately, matrices of the other aroclor 1254-regulated transcription factors are not yet available. the result of this analysis is shown in table  <dig>  in  <dig> out of  <dig> analysed promoter sequences of the directly neighbored genes binding sites of either ahr or/and nf-kappab or/and atf <dig> or/and sp <dig> or/and pparg <dig> or/and rfxank or/and nrf <dig> or/and bhlhb <dig> were identified. in only  <dig> out of  <dig> analysed promoter sequences no transcription factor binding site could be detected, neither an ahr binding site nor a binding site of an aroclor 1254-regulated transcription factor, whose matrice was available in the database transfac® professional rel.  <dig> . notably, these genes might be targets of other aroclor 1254-regulated transcription factors whose matrices are not yet available. thus, once a chromatin domain of about  <dig> kbp is opened for the primary targets of aroclor  <dig>  the promoters of genes located within this domain might be accessible also for secondary targets of aroclor  <dig> .

discussion
ahr-mediated gene regulation has been defined by a sequence of events by which the ligand-activated ahr translocates into the nucleus and binds to ahr-dna binding sites in the promoters, thereby altering gene expression controlled by these promoters  <cit> . this mode of action limits the regulation of genes by the ligands of the ahr, including polyhalogenated and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , to those containing ahr binding sites.

it has often been described in the literature, however, that xenobiotics bound to the ahr cause a large number of apparently unrelated biological and toxic effects  <cit> , suggesting that there exist other mechanisms to cause the observed responses without acting through ahr binding sites in the promoters of the corresponding genes.

in this study, we performed computational analyses in order to elucidate the network of transcription factors and their target genes in response to ahr activation or activation of as yet unknown factors by aroclor  <dig> in cultures of human hepatocytes.

activation and repression of transcription factors and the ensuing changes in gene regulation seem to be hallmarks of the molecular mechanisms of aroclor  <dig>  many of them are candidates for being regulated directly by ahr, through its binding to the corresponding in silico-identified dna binding sites in their promoters. this proposed network of transcription factors involved in regulation of gene expression under direct or indirect influence by the ahr is depicted in figure  <dig> 

in spite of the considerably higher fold occurrence of ahr binding sites in the whole of aroclor 1254-regulated gene promoters analyzed as compared to non-influenced gene promoters, many of them possess no ahr binding sites at all. these genes might be regulated by aroclor  <dig> for various reasons: 1) the changes in the expression of these genes might be secondary effects, maybe through the influence of transcription factors the expression of which is regulated by ahr directly. thus, the directly regulated transcription factors seem to be the basis for the regulatory gene network induced by aroclor  <dig>  through the ensuing regulation of their target genes. 2) the changes in the expression of these genes might also be direct effects through an as yet unknown influence of aroclor  <dig> on other transcription factors. parallel activity of activated tfs would be plausible causes for the pleiotropic effects seen in animals upon treatment with pcbs. 3) furthermore, it is known that functional ahr sites may be situated in the promoter regions of the ahr target genes, in their introns as well as in far upstream and downstream non-coding regions around the genes. in  <dig>  however, we could demonstrate that within the window of - <dig> bp upstream from the start of transcription ahr sites could be observed with the highest frequency in ahr-regulated genes  <cit> . for that purpose, we decided to analyze exclusively these regions of the promoters. nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that we lose information by this means. 4) these genes might also be regulated through co-localization to directly regulated genes within a chromatin domain .

in spite of using an ahr matrix, the quality of which has been demonstrated to be high  <cit> , it must be mentioned that the in silico identification of transcription factor binding sites in dna sequences is not a sufficient proof for binding of the corresponding factor in vivo. moreover, in some cases binding of transcription factors in vivo occurs in promoters of genes whose expression is not altered  <cit> .

despite this limitation the computational analysis of microarray data reveal novel insight into the regulation of networks of tfs acting in concert.

indeed, one of the aroclor 1254-induced transcription factors is nf-kappab . nf-kappab is a key regulator of immune, inflammatory, and acute phase responses and is also involved in the control of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and oncogenesis. nf-kappab is known to control many physiological functions adversely affected by ahr ligands. remarkable progress has been made in understanding the signal transduction pathways that lead to activation of nf-kappab factors and consequent induction of gene expression  <cit> . in this study, expression of nf-kappab was induced about 11-fold by aroclor  <dig>  we identified a single ahr binding site in its gene promoter. therefore, the transcription might be induced through binding of activated ahr directly. the existing literature provides no information regarding activation of nf-kappab gene expression by ahr. however, a recent study showed physical interaction and mutual functional repression between ahr and nf-kappab  <cit> . protein-protein interactions between tfs are a further important mode of action to increase their regulatory repertoire.

in the past few years, the importance of combinatorial regulation of transcription by networks of transcription factors has begun to be realized. in this study, we identified several transcription factor binding sites occurring proximal to ahr in the aroclor 1254-regulated promoters, amongst them nf-kappab. they belong to a common framework of transcription factors acting in concert in response to aroclor  <dig>  thus, also in transcriptional regulation, ahr and nf-kappab seem to work together. moreover, creb and sp <dig> were found to be part of this framework. the creb transcription factor is a member of the leucine zipper family. this protein binds as a homodimer to the camp-responsive element, an octameric palindrome. the protein is phosphorylated by several protein kinases and induces transcription of genes in response to stimulation of the camp pathway. in this study, creb was shown to be induced by aroclor  <dig>  maybe directly through binding of ahr to the in silico-identified ahr binding sites in its promoter. the transcription factor sp <dig>  which was not determined on the aroclor  <dig> microarray, is a dna-binding protein which interacts with a variety of gene promoters containing gc-box elements and is known to physically and functionally interact with ahr in promoters of several genes in which sp <dig> plays an important role in basal gene expression  <cit> . moreover, a functional synergism of sp <dig> and the nuclear factor y  in transcriptional stimulation of the rat pyruvate kinase m  gene could recently be demonstrated  <cit> . sp <dig> and nf-y  stimulate transcription of the pkm gene via their interactions. here, we found sp <dig> binding sites in  <dig> % of aroclor 1254-induced as well as in  <dig> % of repressed gene promoters proximal to ahr binding sites, but we found ecat binding sites exclusively in  <dig> % of the induced gene promoters and not in repressed promoters. therefore, the induction of ahr-regulated transcription might also be the result of the interplay between sp <dig> and ecat/nf-y.

furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that ahr forms a complex and synergizes with retinoblastoma protein  to repress e2f-dependent transcription and cell cycle progression  <cit> . again, a very recent study demonstrated that ahr-mediated gene repression requires combinatorial interactions at e2f-reponsive promoters, leading to the repression of e2f-dependent, s phase-specific genes  <cit> . by analogy, we showed e2f binding sites to be part of a common framework of all aroclor 1254-repressed gene promoters analyzed.

atf <dig>  here found to be induced by aroclor  <dig>  is a transcription factor that represses transcription from promoters with atf sites through stabilization of the binding of inhibitory co-factors at the promoter  <cit> . atf3deltazip, here found to be repressed by aroclor  <dig>  is an alternatively spliced form of atf <dig> that encodes a truncated atf <dig> which does not bind dna, stimulates transcription and antagonizes the action of atf <dig>  <cit> . antagonism of both these splice forms is also reflected in the aroclor  <dig> reaction resulting from our microarray experiments, in which atf <dig> is induced whereas atfdeltazip is reduced by aroclor  <dig> .

another transcription factor, the expression of which was induced about three-fold by aroclor  <dig>  was the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma . this is one example of a soluble intracellular receptor, which is important in mediating toxic responses and is associated with hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents  <cit> .

concerning aroclor 1254-regulated genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis, some of them are remarkable and will be discussed. in our microarray analysis, the cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig>  was induced  <dig> -fold by aroclor  <dig>  sprouty <dig> is known to attenuate epidermal growth factor receptor ubiquitylation and endocytosis, and consequently enhances ras/erk signaling  <cit> . various intracellular signaling cascades are altered in tumor cells. among these, the receptor tyrosine kinase ras/erk signaling pathway was found to be constitutively active in a significant percentage of human tumors . furthermore, the cell cycle inhibitory protein p <dig>  was found to be induced  <dig> -fold by aroclor  <dig>  the carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benzo pyrene, which is a high-affinity ahr ligand, is known to cause growth arrest in 3t <dig> fibroblasts during the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle  <cit> . we identified a potential ahr binding site in the cip <dig> promoter; hence, the induction of cip <dig> by aroclor  <dig> could be a direct effect of ahr. cdc25a, a phosphatase essential for g1-s transition, for cell cycle progression, which is known to compete against cip <dig>  was shown here to be reduced by 50% upon aroclor 1254-treatment.

to gain a better understanding of the expression of individual genes in response to aroclor  <dig>  it was useful to analyze the corresponding promoter sequences for regulatory modules, especially transcription factor binding sites, being responsible for quantitative changes in the expression. this resulted in models of transcriptional regulation, either induction or repression, controlled by a special network of regulatory modules. and some facts known from the literature for single genes could be confirmed here in silico for many genes .

however, mapping the aroclor 1254-induced transcriptome back onto the genome was useful to get insight into the large-scale regulation of transcription. here, we found that genes regulated by aroclor  <dig>  are much closer located to each other than genes distributed randomly all over the genome, which raises the possibility of chromatin structure being involved in the large-scale regulation of transcription.

chromatin is usually described as being divided into "open" domains where genes have the potential to be expressed through the accessibility of the corresponding gene promoters for different transcription factors, and domains of "closed" regions where gene expression is shut down. the existence of co-expressed/co-localized gene clusters is consistent with a model where large chromatin regions would change their activity  status in a tissue-specific manner, allowing neighboring genes to be transcribed or shut down in a coordinated way. in this study, large chromatin regions might change their activity  status in response to the influence of aroclor  <dig>  this means that, besides being controlled individually, e.g. through ahr, genes may also be subject to regulation according to their location within the genome. thus, expression of co-localized genes might reflect rules in chromatin remodeling and, as a consequence, gene transcription. notably, we corroborated our proposal by promoter analyses of directly neighbored regulated genes. most of the promoters included binding sites of either ahr or  transcription factor whose expression was/were found to be regulated by aroclor  <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
taken collectively, global gene regulation in response to aroclor  <dig> seems to be the result of different coordinate events .

1: the aroclor 1254-activated nuclear transcription factor ahr influences the expression of different transcription factors by binding to ahr recognition sites in corresponding promoters. these transcription factors constitute the basis of a regulatory gene network that again influences the expression of different genes. it has to be kept in mind here that also other transcription factors could well be primary targets of aroclor  <dig> 

2: the aroclor 1254-activated nuclear transcription factor ahr seems to act in concert with other transcription factors, because a common framework of the corresponding binding sites could be identified proximal to ahr in the aroclor 1254-regulated gene promoters. the combination of co-acting transcription factors might be one reason for the level of gene expression being either induced or repressed. here, it also has to be kept in mind that transcription factors whose sites are found in the neighborhood of ahr binding sites could well be primary targets of aroclor  <dig> 

3: chromosomal localization seems to be important in the large-scale regulation of mrna transcripts in response to aroclor  <dig>  hence, genes in neighborhood of direct aroclor 1254-induced transcriptional regulation , might be co-expressed through the accessibility of their promoters for the transcription factors whose expression were influenced by aroclor  <dig> .

our findings with ahr may well translate to a more general principle of gene transcription, and with the advent of microarray studies combined with well performed bioinformatics distinction of targeted gene transcription from co-expression of nearby genes within a chromatin domain becomes feasible.
