BACKGROUND
caseous lymphadenitis  is an infectious, chronic and subclinical disease of sheep and goats with a worldwide occurrence  <cit> . cla is characterised by the formation of subcutaneous abscesses in lymph nodes or as a subclinical infection in internal organs, such as the lungs, liver and kidneys  <cit> . the etiologic agent of cla is corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, a gram-positive, non-spore-forming, aerobic and facultative intracellular parasite of macrophages  <cit> . cla is responsible for significant economic losses in the sheep and goat industries due to its high incidence, causing condemnation of carcasses, devaluation of leather due to scars left by abscesses, decreased production of meat or milk, and occasional death of affected animals  <cit> .

cla commercial vaccines are based on attenuated strains of c. pseudotuberculosis and do not provide satisfactory protection for goats. additionally, annual boosters are needed, which makes prophylaxis more costly  <cit> . thus, the search for an ideal cla vaccine has been prioritised, with the aim of obtaining long-lasting protection with few side effects. additionally, the vaccine should allow the differentiation between vaccinated and infected animals  <cit> .

pursuing this purpose, different vaccine strategies have been tested, and live attenuated vaccines and recombinant proteins are promising options. through a process of random mutagenesis, it was identified  <dig> live recombinant strains of c. pseudotuberculosis  <cit> , one of which  presented promising results in pilot trials, where inoculated mice presented no clinical signs of caseous lymphadenitis and produced a significant amount of specific igg.

the serine protease cp <dig>  encoded by the cp <dig> gene of c. pseudotuberculosis, was tested in infected animals and demonstrated immunogenic properties, showing a strong humoral response on immunoblots and a 82% reduction in the proportion of infected sheep and a 98% reduction in lung lesions  <cit> ; these protection levels were similar to those found with other immunogens, as inactivated bacteria and genetically detoxified phospholipase d  <cit> .

considering the need for new immunogens for caseous lymphadenitis prophylaxis and the promising results already found with the mutant cp <dig> strain and the recombinant cp <dig> protein , the aim of this work is to perform a comparative evaluation of four vaccine formulations containing these immunogens alone or in combination, and determine their ability to induce immunoprotection against caseous lymphadenitis in a murine model.

methods
c. pseudotuberculosis strains and culture conditions
the previously obtained c. pseudotuberculosis cp <dig> mutant strain  <cit> , the t <dig> pathogenic wild-type parental strain  <cit> , and the caprine-pathogenic strain mic- <dig> from the laboratory of genetics and control of microorganisms  bacterial collection were employed in this work. strains were aerobically grown in “brain heart infusion” broth  at 37°c. kanamycin  was added to the mutant growth media. t <dig> and mic- <dig> strains were isolated from caseous lesions of goats and have previously been employed in vaccination trials using goats and mice  <cit> .

bacterial interaction assays with murine j <dig> cells
pre-macrophagic j <dig> cells from murine lymphomas were cultivated in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s essential medium  supplemented with 5% foetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml gentamicin and  <dig>  μg/ml fungizone at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> atmosphere. the cp <dig> mutant strain and t <dig> wild-type strain were grown for 48 hours at 37°c and washed three times with pbs, resuspended in dmem to a concentration of 106 cfu/ml, and used to infect j <dig> cells  grown to approximately 95% confluence in 24-well tissue culture plates.

for determination of intracellular viable bacteria, after  <dig>   <dig> and 6 hours of incubation, infected j <dig> monolayers were washed six times with pbs and treated with 150 μg/ml gentamicin sulphate  diluted in dmem for 1 h. the number of intracellular bacteria was determined by viable counts after lysis of monolayers with  <dig>  ml of  <dig> % tritonx- <dig>  in pbs.

dna extraction and pcr reaction
c. pseudotuberculosis genomic dna was obtained from the t <dig> strain as previously described  <cit> . briefly,  <dig>  ml of the bacteria cultured in bhi broth was centrifuged and resuspended in 50 mm edta with 10 mg/ml lysozyme, and the wizard® genomic dna purification kit  was used following the manufacturer’s instructions. after dna extraction, the material was resolved by electrophoresis on a  <dig> % agarose gel and quantified. eluted dna was stored at −20°c pending pcr amplification.

pcr was performed using the go taq® green master mix kit , with the objective to amplify the cp <dig> gene . the primers used in the pcr assay were cp40f  and cp40r , which contain bamhi and ecori restriction sites, respectively. each pcr reaction had a final volume of 50 μl, with 25 μl from the kit, 1 μl of each primer , 22 μl of ultra-purified water and 1 μl of genomic dna from c. pseudotuberculosis strain t <dig>  the amplification reaction consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94°c for 2 min, 35 cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 94°c, primer hybridisation for 1 min at 55°c and extension at 72°c for  <dig>  min, followed by a final extension at 72°c for 10 min. the reaction was conducted in a thermocycler , and the final product was analysed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel with gelred™  staining.

cloning and recombinant protein production and purification
cloning, recombinant protein production and protein purification were performed as previously described  <cit> . the pae vector  <cit>  and the amplified cp <dig> gene were digested using bamhi and ecori restriction enzymes . after that, the cp <dig> gene was inserted into the pae vector using the t <dig> dna ligase enzyme , and electrocompetent top  <dig> e. coli cells were transformed by electroporation. the transformed bacteria were cultivated in luria-bertani  broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin for 16 h, and the recombinant plasmid was purified using a miniprep kit . the pae/cp <dig> recombinant plasmid was transformed by thermal shock in e. coli bl <dig>  and the recombinant bacteria were cultivated in lb broth containing 1 mm iptg for 3 h at 37°c in an orbital shaker.

for recombinant protein purification, the bacteria resulting from a large-scale culture  were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in a washing buffer  with 100 mg/ml lysozyme, sonicated five times for fifteen seconds  and maintained under agitation at 4°c for 16 h. the recombinant protein was purified using the histraptm hp  affinity chromatography column followed by dialysis in a cellulose tube-based system .

animal model
six- to eight-week-old balb/c mice, a strain which is susceptible to c. pseudotuberculosis infection  <cit> , were employed in this assay. for immunity tests, fifty mice were kept in a vivarium under suitable conditions of temperature and humidity with a 12 h light/dark cycle; food and water were provided ad libitum. the study was approved by the ethics committee for animal experimentation of the tiradentes university .

immunisation protocol, challenge and determination of the protection level
the rcp <dig> recombinant protein and cp <dig> live recombinant strain were used in vaccine formulations. animals were divided into five groups  and immunised intraperitoneally  and/or subcutaneously  on days  <dig> and  <dig>  the administration routes followed what was previously described for recombinant proteins and mutant strains immunisation protocols  <cit> . the negative control group  was inoculated i.p. with 100 μl of saline solution . the g <dig> group was inoculated i.p. with 200 μl of a solution containing rcp <dig>  and saponin  in sterile saline solution. g <dig> was inoculated s.c. with 100 μl of the cp <dig> recombinant live strain . g <dig> was inoculated i.p. with 200 μl of a solution containing rcp <dig>  and saponin  and s.c. with 100 μl of the recombinant live cp <dig> strain . group g <dig> used a heterologous prime-boost strategy and was first inoculated i.p. with 200 μl of rcp <dig>  and saponin  in solution followed by an s.c. booster dose of 100 μl of the live recombinant strain cp <dig>  15 days after the first vaccination.

the previously immunised animals were challenged with 104 cfu/ml  of the mic- <dig> virulent strain thirty days after the last immunisation. the protection conferred was assessed according to the survival rate of the animals immunised with different vaccine formulations. the animals were observed daily, and mortality was recorded over four weeks following the challenge.

blood collection and elisa for specific igg determination
animals were bled at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> post-immunisation to determine the antibody levels. blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus with pasteur pipettes. all blood collections were performed under anaesthesia with ketamine 10%  and xylazine 2%  , and all efforts were made to minimise suffering. after coagulation, blood was centrifuged at  <dig>  g for 10 min. serum was removed and stored at −20°c.

sera samples from the immunised mice were used in immunoassays  for detection of specific igg <dig>  igg2a and igg <dig> antibodies. for this purpose, polystyrene 96-well plates  were coated with 100 μl of c. pseudotuberculosis t <dig> strain supernatant diluted 1: <dig>  <cit>   or  <dig>  ug/ml of rcp <dig>  or a combination of both antigens . all antigen dilutions were made in bicarbonate-carbonate buffer . plates were incubated at 4°c for 18 h. after this period, plates were washed twice with pbs-t  and blocked with 200 μl/well of 5% defatted milk in pbs-t for 2 h at 37°c. after this blocking step, the wells were washed five times with pbs-t and then 100 μl/well of sera samples from mice diluted 1: <dig> in pbs-t were added in duplicate. after one hour of incubation at 37°c and five washes with pbs-t, 50 μl/well of an anti-mouse antibody against igg <dig>  igg2a or igg <dig>  diluted 1: <dig> was added. the plates were again incubated for 45 min at 37°c and then washed five times with pbs-t. after the washes, 50 μl/well of tmb developing solution  was added. the reaction was stopped by adding 25 μl of 4 n h2so <dig>  the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using an elisa reader .

statistical analysis
statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism version  <dig>  for windows . the results of intracellular viability and specific immunoglobulins production were expressed as the means ± standard deviations. differences between igg production in the different groups were calculated by one-way anova followed by the tukey post-test test. the data were considered statistically significant when p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
bacterial interaction assays with murine j <dig> cells
analysing the results presented in figure  <dig>  it can be observed that the mutation harboured by the cp <dig> mutant had a major influence on the ability of this strain to adhere to j <dig> monolayers. after 6 hours of interaction, the rate of cp <dig> cell invasion in j <dig> cells was only 20% of the rate of cellular invasion achieved by the t <dig> parental strain at the same time point.figure  <dig>

evaluation of the igg levels
immunisations with the combination of rcp <dig> and cp <dig> induced the production of igg <dig> in all immunised groups, as shown in figure 2a. the results demonstrated that all groups on days  <dig> and  <dig> post-immunisation  showed no significant igg <dig> production . on day  <dig>  the g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> groups showed significantly higher levels of igg <dig> than groups g <dig> and g <dig> . on days  <dig> and  <dig>  after the challenge with the virulent strain, g <dig> and g <dig> groups showed significantly higher concentrations of igg <dig> than the control and g <dig> groups . no significant igg <dig> production was observed in the g <dig> group after challenge.figure  <dig>

no significant igg <dig> production was observed in any group, either before or after the virulent challenge .

discussion
recombinant proteins and live attenuated vaccines are considered promising tools for the development of new vaccine models. in this regard, dorella et al.  <cit> , using a reporter transposon-based system, identified  <dig> out of  <dig>  mutants that presented detectable alkaline phosphatase  activity. this feature was associated with  <dig> c. pseudotuberculosis loci that encode fimbrial and transport proteins. one of these mutants, cz <dig>  showed promising protective results in pilot trials and was suggested for further investigation in attenuation and immunisation-challenge trials.

in this study, we conducted a cellular adhesion experiment to observe how the mutation in the cp <dig> strain affected its capacity to adhere and infect murine macrophage cells. the results showed a significantly reduced capacity for cell adhesion and invasion, corroborating the genetic fimbrial mutant profile previously observed by dorella et al.  <cit> . clayton et al.  <cit>  observed that mutations in salmonella enterica fimbrial subunits genes led to reduced intestinal colonisation in chickens. additionally, work by van der velden et al.  <cit>  showed that multiple fimbrial adhesions are required for a fully virulent profile in a murine model of salmonella typhimurium infection. this attenuated cellular adhesion profile was confirmed for the c. pseudotuberculosis cp <dig> strain, and other experiments were conducted with the objective of determining the immunogenicity and protective potential of this mutant in a caseous lymphadenitis model in mice.

the development of cellular and humoral immune responses depends on the set of cytokines produced by various cells, including cd4+ and cd8+ t cells. when a naive t helper  cell is activated by dendritic cells, it can differentiate into one of three distinct types of effector th cells called t helper  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . th <dig> cells are mainly involved in immunity against intracellular pathogens, and aid in the activation of macrophages and cytotoxic t cells and the production of opsonising and complement activator immunoglobulin isotypes, such as igg2a in mice. th <dig> cells are involved primarily in immunity against extracellular pathogens, such as multicellular parasites, and assist b cells in producing neutralising antibodies   <cit> .

based on the results presented herein, the g <dig> , g <dig>  and g <dig>  groups had a very significant induction of igg <dig>  mainly from day  <dig> after the start of the trail. the g <dig> group did not presented presented significant igg <dig> levels after the challenge . these results suggest that the groups treated with inoculation solutions containing the mutant strain presented an immune response mediated by th <dig> lymphocytes, as can be indicated by significant igg <dig> production  <cit> .

although the protective role of igg2a in this disease model is largely unknown, this igg subtype is thought to modulate the immune response by inducing phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages and activating the complement system and cytotoxicity mediated by antibody-dependent cells. igg2a production requires the induction of ifn-gamma by th <dig> and nk cells  <cit> . our results indicate that g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> groups presented significant igg2a production thirty days after the first immunisation, with a perceptible boost in its concentration after challenge with the recombinant strain; the group inoculated with the cp <dig> mutant strain alone was not able to produce specific igg2a. thus, significant igg2a production in the above groups demonstrates the ability of the rcp40-saponin formulation to generate a th <dig> adaptive immune response and memory. the th <dig> immune response is responsible for the elimination of intracellular pathogens such as c. pseudotuberculosis  <cit> , suggesting that the type of response induced in animals inoculated with the recombinant protein is consistent with the immune activity responsible for the control of intracellular bacteria.

according to marini et al.  <cit> , immune responses with high levels of igg <dig>  igg2a and igg <dig> in the serum are important mechanisms that help eliminate microorganisms. this indicates that our results are promising for the development of an effective vaccine against cla. vaccine formulations used in g <dig> , g <dig>  and g <dig>  groups showed more significant results with respect to the level of specific immunoglobulins generated against rcp <dig>  a recombinant protein that is considered to be an important c. pseudotuberculosis virulence factor in genomic and bioinformatics surveys  <cit> .

a 90% protection rate was obtained in animals immunised with rcp <dig> alone, which is consistent with earlier work from walker et al.  <cit> . these authors used the native semi-purified cp <dig> to evaluate antibody levels generated before and after infection in sheep and observed that this native  <dig> kda protein provided an 82% protection rate, significantly reducing lung lesions. the protection in animals immunised only with cp <dig> mutant strain resulted in 50% survival after virulent challenge, which is in agreement with previously published results  <cit> . ribeiro et al.  <cit>  described a high protection rate  in a murine model when using an iron acquisition-deficient mutant obtained with the same methodology employed to develop the cp <dig> mutant, showing that c. pseudotuberculosis live attenuated mutants can be promising tools for protection against caseous lymphadenitis.

animals in groups g <dig>  and g <dig>  had survival rates of  <dig> and 60%, respectively. these two vaccine formulations had not been previously tested, so there is no work in the literature describing aspects of survival. after evaluating the results, it was observed that the survival rates of these groups were intermediate compared with those found in the g <dig> and g <dig> groups, which were vaccinated with only rcp <dig>  and cp <dig> , respectively.

the fact that cp <dig> recombinant protein alone led to a protection rate of 90% whereas the combination of rcp <dig> and cp <dig> mutant showed only a 70% protection can be explained by a differential complexation of the cp <dig> protein with the saponin adjuvant in the formulation using only the recombinant protein, when compared to the cp <dig> mutant-cp <dig> protein immunogen, which can lead to a different availability of the antigen to the immune system cells. a similar situation was seen by keyburn et al.  <cit>  when working with vaccines to clostridium perfringens; they described that the protection rate achieved with the recombinant netb protein alone was different from the one observed with the combination of the protein with the c. perfringens toxoid.

taken together, these results suggest that vaccine formulations using the recombinant protein cp <dig> alone or in combination with the live recombinant strain cp <dig>  or both antigens used in a prime-boost strategy, result in satisfactory survival percentages and antibody production. however, only the groups that had rcp <dig> in the inoculation solution presented an igg2a response, and the group inoculated only with rcp <dig> was not able to induce an igg-based humoral response, even after the challenge. these results indicate that rcp <dig> was able to induce a th <dig> immune response, and the higher levels of protection in the g <dig> group can be observed as a result of this type of cellular immune response. all the groups stimulated with the combination of rcp <dig> with cp <dig> had a significant igg <dig> response, indicating a th <dig> response. the finding that the marked th <dig> response elicited a low protection rate in those groups can be explained by the bacterial attenuation profile, which showed a reduced capacity of the mutant to adhere and invade murine cells. this reduced invasion can result in a defective presentation of bacterial antigens through a major histocompatibility class  i pathway  <cit>  because these antigens are not present in sufficient levels in the intracellular compartment. in this way, a th <dig> response, represented by significant igg <dig> production, prevailed, and the amount of th <dig> cytokines was potentially insufficient to induce an adequate cellular response against the virulent c. pseudotuberculosis strain.

CONCLUSIONS
the c. pseudotuberculosis cp <dig> live attenuated strain was not able to induce a humoral immune response when inoculated alone in mice; igg production could only be observed when the mutant strain was combined in a vaccine formulation with the cp <dig> recombinant protein. the protection level was higher when the vaccine solutions included only the recombinant protein and was associated with a th <dig> response in the absence of a th <dig> profile after challenge, as seen by the igg isotype production in immunised mice. thus, rcp <dig> associated with a saponin adjuvant is a promising vaccine formulation in the control of caseous lymphadenitis.
