BACKGROUND
genomewide association studies have popularized the use of the case/control design to detect effects associated with an individual’s own genotype, however many diseases  may in fact be due to more complex effects such as maternal genotype effects, maternal-fetal genotype interactions or parent-of-origin  effects. to detect such effects it is necessary to collect genotype data from one or both parents of cases, in addition to genotyping the cases themselves. two existing popular approaches analyse either genetic data from affected offspring and their mothers , along with an appropriate control sample  <cit> , or else analyse genetic data from affected offspring and both parents , without use of controls  <cit> . in contrast, our software emim uses a multinomial modelling approach  <cit>  that allows the simultaneous consideration of both case/mother duos and/or case/parent trios, with additional child and parent genotype data  included when available. the child-parent genotype data can be extracted from standard plink-format  <cit>  pedigree files using our companion software premim.

full details and evaluation of the multinomial modelling approach used by emim have been described previously  <cit> . the early beta version of emim described in  <cit>  allowed a more limited set of child-parent configurations than are supported in the current version, and did not include the current full range of optional likelihood assumptions   <cit> ). most importantly, the companion program premim was not available, limiting the ease with which emim could be applied to real data.

premim: pedigree file conversion
for each snp in turn, premim performs a simple algorithm to select from each pedigree the most informative sub-unit of child-parent genotype data. different pedigree sub-units are chosen in order of preference as listed in table  <dig> 

there are a number of options that may be given to premim. in particular, it is possible to override the default choice of individuals by stating a proband subject for certain pedigrees. these proband subjects are then chosen as cases . this may be useful to avoid possible bias when larger pedigrees have been ascertained on the basis of a specific affected individual. for larger pedigrees, it is also possible to select multiple case/parent trios or multiple control matings from each pedigree, potentially increasing the power to detect genetic effects. this option does have the potential to generate bias , and so results should be interpreted with caution, although we anticipate that most people will apply these types of method to small pedigrees such as child/parent trios, making this issue less of a concern in practice. , have been described by  <cit> ).

emim methodology
the basic principle behind emim is simple: to test for the existence of  genotype relative risk parameters that increase  the probability that a child is affected. by default, premim chooses the minor allele to be considered as the ‘risk’ allele, although this option can be overridden if required. we denote by r <dig> the factor by which an individual’s disease risk is multiplied if they possess one  risk alleles at a given locus. we denote by s <dig> the factor by which an individual’s disease risk is multiplied if their mother possesses one  risk alleles at that locus. we denote by i
m
 the factor by which an individual’s disease risk is multiplied if they inherit a risk allele from their mother . lastly, to test for mother-child interactions, we denote by γ
ij
 the factor by which an individual’s disease risk is multiplied if the mother carries i risk alleles and the child carries j risk alleles. a summary of these relative risk parameters is shown in table  <dig>  a variety of restrictions may be made on the parameters as desired. for example, a multiplicative model for the effects of the alleles in the mother  or child  may be imposed. in addition, emim also supports several alternative previously-proposed paramaterizations for the imprinting and interaction effects  <cit>  .

as an example, denote the major and minor alleles by  <dig> and  <dig>  then for a case/parent trio where the genotypes of the mother, father and child are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  respectively, the penetrance is modelled as: 

  p=αr1s2imγ <dig> 

 where α is the baseline probability of disease and g

emim uses a multinomial model to estimate the relative risk parameters on the basis of observed counts of genotype combinations in case/parent trios as shown in table  <dig>  emim models the  <dig> different cell probabilities  in terms of the desired genotype relative risk parameters . a maximum of  <dig> parameters are estimable, meaning that not all of these parameters can be estimated simultaneously. cordell et al.  <cit>  suggested building up models from simpler to more complex via a series of nested hypothesis tests. given a model for the penetrances in terms of the genotype relative risk parameters, the overall likelihood for the data in table  <dig> may be written

if any of the subjects are missing, we no longer have  <dig> genotype counts as shown in table  <dig>  but instead we must collapse together rows to express the data in terms of counts of observed genotype combinations. for example, given data for case/mother duos , the  <dig> observable counts are as shown in table  <dig>  the likelihood for the data in this table may be written

in practice, at any given snp, we observe genotype counts  for the following types of unit: case/parent trios ; parents of cases ; case/mother duos ; case/father duos ; mothers of cases ; fathers of cases ; cases . the data for each unit creates a table corresponding to a  version of table  <dig>  and the overall likelihood to be maximized may be constructed as the product of the likelihoods for the individual tables. similarly, we may add in data for controls  by further multiplying the likelihood by the product of the likelihoods for a similar set of control tables. emim makes use of the following types of control unit: parents of controls ; control/mother duos ; control/father duos ; controls . furthermore, emim assumes that the frequencies of the different genotype combinations in control units correspond to those in the general population. this is equivalent to making a rare disease assumption, in the event that the controls are all genuinely unaffected.

by default, emim assumes ‘mating symmetry’  <cit>    <cit>  model), which corresponds to assuming that parental matings  are as likely as matings . this results in the estimation of six mating type stratification parameters  <cit> μ1−μ <dig>  two more restricted  models are also available in emim: 

 <dig>  a model that assumes parental allelic exchangeability   <cit>  

 <dig>  a model that assumes hardy-weinberg equilibrium  and random mating, estimating a single allele frequency parameter in place of the six mating type stratification parameters.

in addition to these more restricted models, a less restricted ‘conditional on parental genotypes’   <cit>  model  is also available. this model would be expected to be less powerful than the cepg, pae or hwe models, but should be more robust to any departure from mating symmetry, pae or hwe.

emim reads in genotype data from input files created by premim. in addition, there are two other files required by emim. firstly, a file ‘emimmarkers.dat’, which provides the minor allele frequencies for each snp . these can optionally be estimated by premim using the pedigree data, although other  sources for this information may be preferred where available. . the other required file is a parameter file ‘emimparams.dat’, describing the type of analysis that emim should perform, which parameters to estimate, and which assumptions  should be made.

implementation
premim is written in c++ and for a binary pedigree file with  <dig> pedigrees,  <dig> subjects and  <dig> snps it takes  <dig> seconds to process on a six-core amd opterontm processor with  <dig>  ghz cpus. emim is written in fortran  <dig> and makes use of a subroutine maxfun, originally written as part of the s.a.g.e.  <cit>  package. for these same data  on the same machine, emim takes  <dig> minute and  <dig> seconds to perform an analysis to test for multiplicative child genotype effects, assuming hwe. for larger data sets, emim and premim have options that allow easy parallel processing by dividing the snps to analyse into different batches.

RESULTS
example analysis using simulated data
we used the program simped  <cit>  to generate a single replicate of simulated data for  <dig> case/parent trios,  <dig> case/mother duos,  <dig> control/mother duos and  <dig> unrelated controls at  <dig> snps across a chromosome. we used a simplified linkage disequilibrium  model that assumed ld operated in haplotype blocks, each of length  <dig> snps. we simulated child genotype effects  at snp  <dig> and maternal genotype effects  at snp  <dig>  we then used emim to test for maternal effects, with and without allowing for child genotype effects , and to test for child genotype effects, with and without allowing for maternal effects . in all four analyses, we see a strong signal at the correct location, with the high significance probably due to the relatively large effect sizes assumed.

a tutorial for this example  is available on the premim and emim website: http://www.staﬀ.ncl.ac.uk/richard.howey/emim/example.html

comparison of hwe, pae, cepg and cpg likelihoods
the power to detect genetic effects can vary depending on the assumptions made. as a demonstration, we simulated  <dig> replicates of data at a single snp for a sample consisting of  <dig> of each of the following units: case/parent trios, case/mother duos, case/father duos, control matings, control/mother duos and control/father duos. we assumed either a child genotype effect , a maternal genotype effect , or a maternal imprinting effect . premim and emim were used to estimate the parameters r <dig>  r <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and i
m
 for each different likelihood assumption and for each set of simulated data. figure  <dig> shows that the power to detect the relevant effect decreases as one makes less restrictive  assumptions, while figure  <dig> shows that unbiased parameter estimation is achieved using the most restrictive assumption  . similar unbiased parameter estimation is achieved for the other likelihood assumptions, when they are met .
m
, assuming hwe. dotted lines show the true parameter values.

effect of missing data on power
as a demonstration of the effect that missing data has on the power, we performed analyses at a single snp using simulated data  and assuming a range of probabilities of missing genotype data. we assumed a maternal genotype effect . the expected proportion of pedigree units of different types remaining in the analysis are shown in figure 3a and figure 3b respectively. the trios are all present when there is no missing data, but the expected proportion quickly decreases when the probability of missing genotype data is increased. the expected proportion of the other pedigree types then increases, but subsequently decreases and converges to  <dig> as the probability of missing data approaches  <dig>  the power to detect the maternal genetic effects  also decreases with increasing proportion of missing data . an advantage of the emim framework is that it makes efficient use of data from all possible available individuals, allowing one to recover information even from incompletely genotyped trios.

buyske  <cit>  pointed out that maternal genotype effects can masquerade as child genotype effects, if analysed as such. if the maternal genetic effects are incorrectly modelled as child genetic effects , we find limited power to detect these effects even when there is no missing data. increasing the proportion of missing data has little effect on the power of this analysis, until the probability of missing genotype data becomes very large .

comparison with mendel
several other software packages exist that allow testing and estimation of genotype relative risk parameters similar to those tested in emim. one such package is mendel  <cit> . mendel most easily allows the estimation and testing of mother-child interaction effects via the maternal-fetal genotype incompatibility  test  <cit> , although a “generalized risk” analysis that allows implementation of more complex user-defined paramaterizations  is also available.

we used computer simulations  to compare the performance of mendel and emim under three different comparable models: 

 <dig>  model  <dig>  this model has been used to test for rhd incompatibility  <cit>  and estimates the relative risk corresponding to the mother having no risk alleles and the child one risk allele. mendel was used to estimate this one relative risk parameter by setting the sex-specific effects  to be equal. the equivalent single parameter γ <dig> was estimated in emim. the data were simulated assuming γ01= <dig> 

 <dig>  model  <dig>  this model has been used to test for non-inherited maternal antigens  on rheumatoid arthritis   <cit>  and consists of three parameters : a relative risk parameter  for mfg when the mother has one risk allele and the child has no risk alleles, and two parameters for child effects when the child has one or two risk alleles. in order to compare emim with mendel under this model, we used premim to reassign which allele should be considered as the risk allele by emim. a model equivalent to mendel’s nima model can then be fit in emim by estimating parameters  r1r2and γ <dig>  data were simulated assuming an mfg effect γ10= <dig>  the power to detect the the mfg effect in either mendel or emim was calculated by considering twice the difference between the negative log likelihood from a model that includes all three parameters  and that from a model where the mfg parameter has been removed.

 <dig>  model  <dig>  this mendel model is a general mfg test consisting of one relative risk parameter for each of the  <dig> mother/child genotype combinations. the relative risk parameter denoted u_ <dig> in the mendel documentation  was set to  <dig> and not estimated to avoid over-parametrization. the other  <dig> parameters, u_ <dig>  u_ <dig>  u_ <dig>  u_ <dig>  u_ <dig>  u_ <dig>  were estimated. the  <dig> parameters estimated by emim were r <dig>  r <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  γ11and γ <dig>  these parameters are not indvidually equivalent to the  <dig> mendel parameters, but the models as a whole can be shown to be equivalent. data for this comparison were simulated assuming r1=s1=γ11=γ22= <dig>  and r2=s2= <dig> .

figures  <dig> and  <dig> show a comparison of the null model  and the full model log likelihoods from emim and mendel, for models  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. emim was set to assume hwe . we see that the null and full model log likelihoods from the two programs are are very similar ,  <dig>   <dig>  5), resulting in approximately equal powers and parameter estimates ,  <dig>   <dig>  5). for model  <dig>  emim and mendel similarly gave approximately equal log likelihoods and powers .

one difference between emim and mendel was the time taken to perform the analysis, with emim performing considerably quicker than mendel. for example, the time to run model  <dig>  showed that premim and emim combined took  <dig>  seconds and mendel took  <dig>  seconds . this shows that premim and emim combined were approximately  <dig> times faster than mendel in this example. the same analysis with  <dig> case/parent trios gave times of  <dig>  seconds for premim and emim combined and  <dig>  seconds for mendel , showing premim and emim to be approximately  <dig> times faster then mendel. a possible reason for the difference in running times is the fact that the extended mfg model  <cit>  implemented in mendel is a slightly more complicated model than the parent/offspring trio model implemented in emim .

comparison with lem
another program with the capability to analyse complex genetic effects  is lem  <cit> . lem is a windows-based log-linear modelling program designed primarily to be used via a graphical user interface, although it is possible to run it from the dos command line, in order to implement scripts that allow the analysis of large numbers of loci or replicates. lem takes an input parameter file which defines the model, the parameters to be estimated and the name of the input data file. we created input parameter and data files based on examples provided by the authors of lem  <cit>  for case/parent trios and by  <cit>  for case/mother and control/mother duos. 

 <dig>  case/parent trios. simped  <cit>  was used to simulate a single replicate of data at  <dig> snps across a chromosome for  <dig> case/parent trios. child effects  were simulated at snp number  <dig> and maternal effects  were simulated at snp number  <dig>  in both emim and lem we tested for maternal effects while allowing for child and maternal imprinting effects  with a null 3-parameter model ). we calculated the p-value for lem on the basis of the reported log likelihoods by using the wald statistic as a 
χ2value with  <dig> degrees of freedom. .

 <dig>  case/mother duos and control/mother duos. again, data were simulated at  <dig> snps but this time for  <dig> case/mother duos and  <dig> control/mother duos. child effects  were simulated at snp number  <dig> and maternal effects  were simulated at snp number  <dig>  in both emim and lem we tested for maternal and child effects i.e. we compared a null model with no fitted parameters to an alternative model with parameters .

a comparison of emim versus lem for the case/mother and control/mother duos is shown in figure  <dig>  figure  <dig> and  <dig> show that the p-values across the chromosome appear to be indistinguishable, and figure  <dig> shows that the p-values for each snp from the two programs are indeed approximately equal. figures  <dig> and  <dig> show that the estimates of r <dig> and s <dig> are approximately equal and figures  <dig> and  <dig> show that r2and s <dig> are also approximately equal, but with more variability.

. we see that the p-values and parameter estimates provided by the two programs are virtually indistinguishable.

these results indicate that the inference provided by lem and emim is essentially identical. this is as expected given the mathematical equivalence  <cit>  between the multinomial model fit by emim and the log linear model fit by lem. the main difference between the programs is the time taken to perform the analysis, with emim performing considerably quicker than lem. for example, the time taken to run the case/mother and control/mother duos analysis across  <dig> snps in premim/emim was  <dig> minute  <dig> seconds on a linux machine  or  <dig> minutes  <dig> seconds on windows , whereas the same analysis in lem took  <dig> hours,  <dig> minutes and  <dig> seconds on windows . the difference in speed between the two programs for the case/parent trios analysis was not as extreme, with premim/emim taking  <dig> minutes  <dig> seconds on linux or  <dig> minutes  <dig> seconds on windows, versus lem’s time of  <dig> minutes  <dig> seconds on windows. the improved speed for the lem trios analysis was most likely due to the fact that it took fewer steps than the duos analysis during the likelihood maximization process . it is possible that differences between maximization algorithms and convergence criteria could account for some of the differences in speed between premim/emim and lem; we found it difficult to determine how to obtain precise control over such factors in lem and were forced to use input files that very closely matched the examples provided by  <cit> . another factor influencing speed could be the fact that lem does not  allow the input of multiple snps simultaneously, meaning that we had to create and read into lem a separate input file for each snp analysed.

CONCLUSIONS
here we have presented two new computer tools, premim and emim, for the estimation of parental and child genetic effects, based on genotype data from a variety of different child-parent configurations. the current version of emim improves upon the early beta version described in  <cit>  by allowing a larger set of possible child-parent configurations, a larger range of optional likelihood assumptions, and by the development of the companion program, premim, for generating the required input files from standard plink-format files, considerably improving the ease with which emim can be applied to real data.

in application to simulated data, we have shown that the inference provided by emim is essentially equivalent to that provided by alternative  software packages such as mendel and lem. emim does have the advantage of allowing easy implementation of a wider class of models than are most easily implemented in mendel and lem, although the expert mendel/lem user could probably achieve the same model flexibility through judicious choice of parameter restrictions. however, premim and emim  considerably outperform mendel and lem in terms of speed of execution, an advantage that is likely to be all the more important when applying these approaches to large-scale data sets such as those generated in genome-wide association studies. to allow further increases in speed, premim and emim also have the advantage of allowing easy parallel processing  by dividing the snps to analyse into different batches.

limitations of premim and emim include the fact that larger pedigrees are divided into case/parent or control/parent trios  prior to analysis, and the fact that snps are analysed one at a time, without borrowing information from neighbouring markers . methods for dealing with larger pedigrees, valid under the assumptions of random mating and/or hardy-weinberg equilibrium , have been described by  <cit> , while  <cit>  present an approach that models haplotypes rather than individual snps, allowing the borrowing of information  across neighbouring snps. both of these features would be valuable additions to future releases of our software. nevertheless, the current versions of emim and premim provide easy-to-use command-line tools for the analysis of pedigree data, allowing testing and estimation of a variety of parental and child genotype relative risks.
