BACKGROUND
the domestic dog , with its more than  <dig> recognised breeds  <cit> , displays great variation in behaviour phenotypes. favourable behaviour is important for well-being and negative traits such as aggression may ruin the owner-dog relationship and lead to relinquishment to shelters or even euthanasia of otherwise healthy dogs  <cit> . behavioural traits result from an interaction of both genetic and environmental factors. breed-specific behavioural traits such as hunting, herding and calmness/aggression are, however, evidence of a large genetic component and specific behaviours show high heritabilities  <cit> .

traditionally, rodents have provided the most important models for studies of genes involved in human mental illness. with the whole-genome sequencing of the modern dog completed  <cit> , a new, efficient model for genetic studies has emerged. the dog suffers from a number of behavioural disorders and many of these have human parallels that are treated with the same medicines  <cit> . canine patients from breeds with an increased risk of aggression, anxiety, and stereotypic behaviours provide important resources for genetic research.

functional genome studies can be performed efficiently with cdna microarrays  <cit>  or subtraction hybridisation methods  <cit> . these are important methods to discover new associations between phenotype and expression of specific genes. however, understanding the nature of gene expression demands both the replication of initial results as well as further exploration of expression in additional samples and individuals. detailed exploration of differential gene expression is most often performed with pcr   <cit> . besides generating important basic biological knowledge, canine genetic studies and a linking of specific genes to aggression may lead to the detection of markers to be used in breeding. also such information will be important in the development of new drugs for treatment of behavioural disorders, both in animals and man.

few studies have addressed gene expression in different canine brain parts. saetre et al.  <cit>  explored region-specific gene expression in canids and lindberg et al.  <cit>  described differential expression in different regions of the fox brain. in the present investigation we studied the expression of nine  genes in different brain parts of aggressive and non-aggressive dogs by qrt-pcr. an initial pcr-based cdna subtraction method, with the amygdala of an aggressive dog as the primary target, indicated that these genes were expressed differentially. the purpose of the work was to study gene-specific differences in expression between brain parts, and between aggressive and non-aggressive dogs.

RESULTS
initial screening with cdna subtraction assays
in the initial screening, the first of two parallel cdna subtraction protocols identified  <dig> genes  that were up-regulated in aggressive amygdala compared to non-aggressive amygdala. six of these genes  were tested with qrt-pcr in the brains of  <dig> dogs. the second parallel assay identified  <dig> genes up-regulated in the same aggressive amygdala versus frontal cortex, and five  of these were tested with qrt-pcr. two of the genes, scd and calm <dig> were common to both initial assays.

qrt-pcr
up-regulation detected by the initial screenings was tested by qrt-pcr in a broader database of unrelated dogs. comparison of the aggressive and non-aggressive dogs in the extended samples of  <dig> dogs showed that there was a significant association of ube2v <dig>  and znf <dig>  with the odds ratio  for aggressive behaviour. odds ratio expresses the relative change in odds that is associated with one unit change in gene expression. for the other seven genes no significant effect on the phenotype was detected. eight of the nine investigated genes showed significant gene expression differences between the amygdala, frontal cortex, hypothalamus, and parietal cortex . loc <dig> showed up-regulation  with qrt-pcr and thus supported the initial result from the amygdala versus frontal cortex assay. five of the nine studied genes were up-regulated in male compared to female .

discussion
the initial cdna subtraction assays, from two dogs, revealed  <dig> differentially-expressed genes. nine of these were tested with quantitative real-time pcr  in the samples from  <dig> dogs and revealed that ube2v <dig> and znf <dig> expression was significantly associated with risk of aggression . the up-regulation of loc <dig> in the amygdala versus frontal cortex supported the initial analysis. the relatively low number of initially-detected genes that showed up-regulation when tested with qrt-pcr may be a result of the target molecules being rare transcripts with low degrees of differential expression. phenotypic differences in the dogs of the two data sets, sampling and the heterogeneous nature of the brain tissues may also have contributed to the different results from the two methods. consequently, in our study, the initial subtraction assays worked as small-scale screenings for potential transcripts. the real-time study included more individuals than the initial assays and would as such have had much stronger statistical validity.

quantitative real-time pcr is a sensitive method for detection of genes showing low levels of expression differences. for most of the genes in the study the estimated expression differences between phenotype, sex and brain parts were relatively small . wurmbach et al.  <cit>  have shown that most regulated genes in brain tissues in mouse fall within this range. the heterogeneous nature of brain regions with a large variety of cell populations that are closely intermingled may result in only small fold-changes for biologically significant expression differences.

the analysis shows that up-regulation of ube2v <dig>  and znf <dig>  are significantly associated with increased or for aggressive behaviour. zinc finger protein  <dig>  is a gene in the krüppel-type zinc finger family. in man, this is a large gene family with krüppel-associated box  motifs and the krab-znf proteins are predicted to function as transcriptional regulators  <cit> . functionally, the ube2v <dig> gene has been proposed to participate in cell proliferation, protein polyubiquitination, regulation of dna repair, regulation of progression through cell cycle, protein modification, and the ubiquitin cycle. disposition for aggressive behaviour is most probably polygenic and influenced by several different neurotransmitter and hormonal systems. our results indicate that ube2v <dig> is involved in pathways associated with aggressive behaviour and that znf <dig> is involved in transcription regulation, possibly associated with behavioural change.

analyses of different brain tissues yield, as expected, differential gene expression between the tissues. although these differences have no established link to any behavioural phenotypes they are a contribution to the limited reports of canine brain gene expression. the studied genes are to a great extent down-regulated in hypothalamus, with the exception of scd and tmem <dig> . interestingly, scd was one of the genes that were identified in both our initial independent studies. saetre et al.  <cit>  also showed down-regulation of a number of hypothalamic genes, compared to amygdala and frontal lobe, while scd was reported by dridi et al.  <cit>  to be highly expressed in chicken hypothalamus. scd is an iron-containing enzyme that catalyses a rate-limiting step in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and yamasaki et al.  <cit>  recently showed stearoyl-coa desaturase  <dig> to be up-regulated in brain tissues from schizophrenic patients. another observation of interest is the large number of genes showing expression differences between brain tissues. this observation is supported by saetre et al.  <cit>  who found that brain tissue differences exceeded the difference between different canid species, and by strand et al.  <cit>  who showed that gene expression in equivalent brain regions of mice and humans is more alike than different regions within the same species. kennerly et al.  <cit>  revealed regional expression differences in the brain but did not find marked differences among breeds or individual dogs.

calm <dig>  functions include roles in growth and the cell cycle as well as in signal transduction and the synthesis and release of neurotransmitters. in our study, calm <dig> showed lower expression in hypothalamus compared to the three other tissues , which coincides with the findings of saetre et al.  <cit>  for calm <dig>  calm <dig> also showed differential expression in both our initial independent studies.

glt <dig>  the gene for which the largest differences in expression between tissues were observed , is the main gene responsible for clearance of synaptic glutamate, which is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. altered expression of glt <dig> and different splice-variants have been linked to a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and mood and anxiety disorders  <cit> .

loc <dig>  is so far annotated as a model protein. the canine transcript has only been reported in a brain cdna library . additionally, in man the transcript of the ortholog sequence kiaa <dig> has mainly been identified in brain tissues . our analysis shows that the gene is up-regulated in the amygdala compared to the three other tissues and in the frontal- and parietal cortex compared to hypothalamus. .

rimbp <dig>  shows a  <dig>  -  <dig> -fold up-regulation in amygdala, frontal and parietal cortex compared to hypothalamus. these results are supported by a study of rats  <cit>  showing that rimbp <dig> is highly expressed in telencephalon compared to other brain regions.

in our analysis ube2v <dig> was expressed at a low level in the hypothalamus compared to frontal and parietal cortex. atp5a <dig> also showed differentiated expression with down-regulation in amygdala and hypothalamus compared to both of the cortex areas.

our study identified gender differences in expression of atp5a <dig>  calm <dig>  glt <dig>  ube2v <dig>  and znf <dig> . we are not aware of any other reports of gender-related differences in gene expression between canine brain parts. the genes znf <dig> and ube2v <dig> show a significant up-regulation in both the aggressive group and the male group of dogs. the fact that both male and female dogs were equally represented in the aggressive and non-aggressive groups, and the use of a statistical model accounting for both effects, support the results.

in the study we have presented raw significance levels as well as the bonferroni values corrected for multiple testing. each p-value is presented for the reader to have full insight in the results. it could, however, be discussed if the bonferroni correction in this case is a too conservative correction. we consider the initial analysis as a method to establish hypotheses about differential expression in a set of samples. the testing of the initial results with a second method in an extended population of unrelated dogs should give a good basis for assessing the initial results.

phenotyping of the included dogs was based on questionnaires  <cit> . canine aggression is a complex phenotypic trait, which probably has a complex genetic regulation and environmental influence. the aggressive dogs in this study were grouped on the basis of shared aggressive behaviours toward humans.

CONCLUSIONS
this study identifies the ube2v <dig> and znf <dig> expression as being associated with aggression. since studies reporting differential gene expression in canine brain tissue are few in numbers, we have included results elucidating the expression of eight genes in canine brain, including a novel finding of gene expression of loc <dig>  of the same reason we also report findings of differential expression between male and female dogs. we are not aware of any reports based on this high number of brain samples . the statistical power of  <dig> samples is, however, not optimal and call for some caution when interpreting the result. our work contributes with preliminary data in an important area of research that can improve the understanding of functional aspects of aggression.
