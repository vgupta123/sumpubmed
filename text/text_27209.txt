BACKGROUND
higher eukaryotes contain several hundred cell types, each with a distinctive gene expression pattern. during differentiation, a committed expression pattern is set up through the sequential turning on and/or off of different sets of genes and this pattern is propagated through numerous symmetric cell divisions. thus, multicellular organisms have evolved mechanisms for discriminating their gene expression states and maintaining these stages during cell differentiation. when eukaryotic cells enter mitosis, the chromatin becomes highly condensed, most transcription factors are displaced from the chromosomes and almost all transcription is abruptly turned off  <cit> . how do eukaryotic cells remember their previous transcriptional profiles during cell division, rather than having to re-establish the appropriate expression pattern from scratch at the onset of the next cell cycle? in most situations, all cells carry the same genetic material, the genomic dna, throughout their lives, so chromatin-based mechanisms including interactions among dna, histones and non-histone protein factors and modifications of dna and chromatin proteins may account for the transmission of gene expression states through cell division.

previous studies have shown that dnase i-sensitive sites mark active genes on silenced mitotic chromosomes  <cit> . this implies that certain factors withstand chromatin condensation and survive during mitosis to facilitate the rapid reactivation of genes in next cell cycle. a subsequent study has supported this 'bookmarking theory'  <cit> . the basal transcription factor tfiid is partially retained on gene promoters in mitotic chromosomes to serve as such 'bookmark', enabling active transcription to be resumed rapidly on exit from mitosis  <cit> . however, the promoter alone may not be enough for the required memory. many distant regulatory elements have been shown to play important roles in maintaining proper tissue- and developmental stage-specific transcription  <cit> . some of these elements are dnase i-sensitive before the gene is activated. for example, in multilineage progenitor cells, erythroid-specific dnase i-hypersensitive sites  have arisen in the distal regulatory elements of the mouse β-globin gene cluster  <cit> . an early study showed that these hypersensitive sites, once induced, can be propagated to daughter cells  in the absence of the original inducer  <cit> . we therefore speculated that in addition to tfiid, certain tissue-specific transcription factors might serve as 'bookmarks' on distant regulatory regions, which also mediate the propagation of chromatin states during cell division. in mel cells, transcription of globin genes is not activated before induction, yet these genes can retain their transcriptional competence for generations. in this study, we used the globin gene clusters as a model system to investigate whether specific transcription factors remain on the distal regulatory elements in m-phase chromosomes in transcriptionally competent mel cells. we found that the p <dig> subunit of the erythroid-specific activator nf-e <dig> is partially retained on its specific binding sites during mitosis, but another activator, gata- <dig>  is not. this suggests that nf-e <dig> can function as a 'bookmark' to maintain the active competence of the local chromatin domain during cell division.

recent advances in epigenetic studies have indicated that histone modification is also closely correlated with transcriptional regulation. active histone modifications such as hyperacetylation and h3-k <dig> and h3-k <dig> methylation often mark transcriptionally active regions, whereas h3-k <dig> methylation is always related to transcriptional repression. combinations of histone modifications could constitute a set of histone codes that are recognized by specific non-histone proteins to mediate specific chromatin functions  <cit> . using two continuously active hepatic genes as models, a recent study revealed that localized histone hyperacetylation, h3-k <dig> tri- or di-methylation and h3-k <dig> dimethylation at the promoter and the 5' portion of the coding regions remain stable during mitotic chromatin inactivation  <cit> . this suggests that epigenetic factors such as histone modifications should also be considered potential memory markers. here we have investigated the active histone modification status on both the α- and the β-globin gene promoters and the distant hypersensitive sites on mitotic chromosomes in mel cells. the results show that multiple active histone modifications are stably preserved on the mitotic chromosomes.

RESULTS
erythroid-specific activator nf-e <dig>  but not gata- <dig>  marking transcriptional competence of globin genes in mel cell during mitosis
in mel cells, dnase i sensitivity and hypersensitivity have been established on globin gene loci  <cit> , suggesting that they have obtained potential transcription activity. an early study also showed that hypersensitive sites, once been set up, can be propagated to daughter cells  in the absence of the original inducer  <cit> . so we speculated that there might be some memory molecules, possibly involving protein factors or epigenetic marks, on regulatory sequences to help the propagation of transcription competence. there are some specific binding sites of erythroid-specific activators, such as gata- <dig>  nf-e <dig> and fog- <dig>  on globin gene clusters  <cit> , whose occupancies largely contribute to the activation of globin genes. to explore the protein factors involved in the inheritance of transcriptional competence, we investigated the nuclear localization of gata- <dig> and the activating subunit p <dig> of nf-e <dig> in mitotic and interphase cell by in situ immunofluorescence. it was found that gata- <dig> mainly localized in interchromatin regions of cell nucleus and it can not be detected in nuclei of the mitotic cells by in situ immunofluorescence until parental nucleus divided into two progeny nuclei at telophase , indicating that gata- <dig> was not retained on mitotic chromosome as a cellular memory mark during mitosis. in contrast, nf-e2p <dig>  which is punctately organized in both cytoplasm and nucleus of the interphase cells, persists throughout mitosis , implying that it may be involved in the propagation of transcription competence of globin genes during cell division.

in order to confirm this possibility, we arrested murine erythroleukemia  cells into mitosis by treating the cells with nocodazole  <cit> . the mitotic index of cell population after treatment was confirmed to be 92–96% by flow cytometry analysis . the results also showed that a proportion of ~5% mitotic cells, about 50% g0/g1-phase and 45% s-phase cells, respectively, is present in asynchronous mel cell population . the two cell populations were analysed by chip to compare the occupancies of nf-e2p <dig> on distant hypersensitive sites of two mouse globin gene clusters . the result showed that nf-e2p <dig> could be specifically recruited to its binding sites hs <dig> and hs <dig> in interphase cells . in mitotic cells it is still tightly associated with hs <dig> and hs <dig> , indicating that nfe2p <dig> can be retained on mitotic chromosomes to maintain the hypersensitivity of the localized regulatory regions of two mouse globin gene clusters. its retention, moreover, marks the transcriptional competence of globin genes during mel cell division.

epigenetic memory marking transcriptionally competent globin genes
besides protein factors, histone modification is recently identified as an efficient epigenetic factor involved in gene expression regulation through altering chromatin structure. do the eukaryotic cells preserve some epigenetic marks on mitotic chromosomes to maintain its gene expression states? to verify the above-proposed possibility, we first observed the nuclear localization of four kinds of active histone modification including h <dig> acetylation, h <dig> acetylation, h3-k <dig> dimethylation and h3-k <dig> dimethylation in mitotic cells by in situ immunofluorescence. the results showed that all of the four modifications are retained on the mitotic chromosomes to some extent . we further detected the global changes of those modifications in both asynchronized and mitotic arrested mel cell populations by western blotting. after correcting the variation in gel-loading and normalizing for the background, we found that there is a partial loss  of h <dig> acetylation, h <dig> acetylation and h3-k <dig> dimethylation in mitotic cell extraction compared to those in asynchronous cell extraction but no obvious loss of h3-k <dig> dimethylation . this indicates that only part of histone acetylation and h3-k <dig> dimethylation signals can be inherited to mitotic chromatin through dna replication-coupled chromatin assembly process. what is the detailed distribution of these preserved modifications on the mitotic chromosome? we therefore analysed the histone modification status across the distant hypersensitive sites and the adjacent promoter regions of mouse α- and β-globin genes  during mitosis by the comparative chip analysis of the above mentioned asynchronous and mitotic arrested mel cell populations. the results showed that hs <dig>  hs <dig> and hs <dig> of mouse α-globin locus and hs <dig>  hs <dig> and hs <dig> of mouse β-globin locus, as well as the promoters of α-globin and βmaj are acetylated at h <dig> and all of them except hs <dig> and hs <dig> are acetylated at h <dig> in asynchronous cells . higher h3-k <dig> dimethylation at hss and α-globin promoter was noticed when compared to that at β-globin promoter. hs <dig> and α-globin promoter are hypermethylated at h3-k <dig>  but hs <dig> and hs <dig> show trace of signal. hs <dig> and hs <dig> of lcr are hypermethylated at h3-k <dig>  while hs <dig> and βmaj promoter are just slightly methylated at h3-k <dig> . in mitotic cells, the levels of h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation, h3-k <dig> dimethylation dropped at many analyzed regions, while h3-k <dig> dimethylation at all the analysed regions remain stable compared to those in asynchronous cells. moreover h3-k <dig> dimethylation level on mitotic chromosomes is comparable to that in asynchronous cells, which consist with their chromatin states . the results suggested that, despite of some losses, the established active histone code at distant regulatory regions and globin gene promoters before mitotic chromatin inactivation can be stably inherited to mitotic chromosomes to mark the transcriptional competence of mouse globin genes in mel cells.

epigenetic memory marking the active transcription states of the genes
can these epigenetic marks note the different transcription states of thegenes during mitosis? we next performed the comparative chromatin immunoprecipitation  analysis for the promoter regions of the genes with different transcription states. these genes include  c-myc, hsp <dig> and β-actin, which are universally transcribed by rna polymerase ii ;  an actively rnap iii-transcribed gene , and  nef- <dig> and albumin, which are tissue-specifically silenced in mel cells. the results showed that promoter region of the actively transcribed genes like c-myc, hsp <dig>  β-actin and 7sk are hyperacetylated, while inactive genes, nef- <dig> and albumin, are hypoacetylated at both h <dig> and h <dig> in asynchronous mel cells . in synchronized mitotic cells, transcriptionally active genes keep obviously higher levels of histone acetylation at both h <dig> and h <dig> than those of inactive genes,. the fact that, during mitotic chromatin inactivation, the levels of remnant histone acetylation at the promoter regions of the analysed genes depend on their previous expression states strongly suggests that the localized histone acetylation at transcriptionally competent or active gene regions can be taken as the useful epigenetic memory marks to imprint the previous expression states during cell division.

to investigate whether active histone modifications-h3-k <dig> dimethylation and k <dig> dimethylation are preserved at active regions during mitosis, we performed the similarly comparative chip analysis. the results showed that these two kinds of modification are also mainly confined to active gene promoters . in asynchronous cells, the fully activated genes-c-myc and β-actin are hyperdimethylated at h3-k4; incompletely activated gene hsp <dig> are moderately dimethylated at h3-k <dig>  although rna polymerase iii-transcribed gene 7sk is active, similar to inactive genes as nef- <dig> and albumin, there is tiny enrichment of h3-k <dig> dimethylation on the gene. however, h3-k <dig> dimethylation, despite the moderate level, is distributed on the promoters of all the analyzed active genes regardless of the rna polymerase used for transcription. in mitotic cells, these two kinds of active histone modification, similar to histone acetylation, are also preserved on the previously active gene promoter regions and the preserved levels are corresponding with gene expression states. nevertheless, there is some decrease for h3-k <dig> dimethylation but no obvious change for h3-k <dig> dimethylation . these data indicate that the localized h3-k <dig> dimethylation and k <dig> dimethylation at transcriptionally active regions can also serve as molecular memory marks along with histone acetylation. the above results also confirmed that the epigenetic marks composed of active histone modification combinations and localized at active gene regions can be transmitted to mitotic chromosomes for the maintenance of active gene expression states.

discussion
studies on the α- and β-globin genes suggest that certain mechanisms in higher eukaryotic cells fix the stochastic expression patterns during cellular differentiation. although there is a tight balance in the expression of α- and β-globin genes, these expression patterns are consistent with the predictions of the stochastic model  <cit> . analysis has revealed an imbalance between 2α- and 2β-globin gene expression in both cytoplasm and nucleus in a significant proportion of erythroid cells. further elegant experiments have demonstrated that these stochastic expression patterns are established prior to transcriptional activation. importantly, both active and silenced expression patterns are clonally inherited  <cit> . the inherited stochastic patterns cannot be explained simply by random molecular encounters or fluctuations in the transitions between conformational states of a macromolecule, or by the amplification of feedback loops in a transcription factor network. differentiated cells appear to have developed important mechanisms for remembering both transcriptionally active and silent states.

previous studies have indicated that when cells enter mitosis, almost all transcription factors are peeled off the chromatin because the transcription complexes are disrupted  <cit> . however, it has been found that tfiid is retained at active gene promoters during mitotic chromatin inactivation  <cit> . during the process of transcription complex assembly, tfiid interacts first with the core promoter, so its retention on the mitotic chromosomes is an economical way of resuming transcription after mitosis. it has been observed that two enzyme classes, the histone acetyltransferases  and the histone deacetylases , are spatially reorganized and displaced from the condensing chromosomes as the cells progress through mitosis  <cit> . in another study  <cit>  it was shown that histone acetylase , chromatin remodeling complex component , snf2h and fact, along with rna pol-ii at the hnf- <dig>  hnf- <dig> and albumin genes, are all dissociated from the chromatin during mitosis but re-recruited on mitotic exit  <cit> , suggesting that they have roles in the reactivation of transcription.

by employing globin genes as a model system, we found in this study that the tissue-specific factor nf-e2p <dig>  which is crucial for activating globin genes, is preserved on mitotic chromosomes but gata- <dig> is not. this suggests that during cell division, nf-e2p <dig> can serve as a molecular memory marker that maintains the locally hypersensitive state of the globin gene clusters. previous studies have shown that gata- <dig> is involved in regulating transcription by undergoing modifications such as acetylation, phosphorylation and sumoylation, without the recruitment of other partners  <cit> . chromatin remodeling complexes and histone modification enzymes, which are displaced from mitotic chromosomes, depend on other protein factors to reunite them with the chromatin  <cit> . during globin gene activation, nf-e <dig> plays a key role in recruiting other protein factors such as tafii <dig> and cbp, a coactivator of histone acetyltransferase activity  <cit> . tfiid retained on the mitotic chromosomes could also recruit other basal transcription factors when transcription is activated. hence, we predict that higher eukaryotes have evolved mechanisms for preserving certain proteins on mitotic chromosomes, which may have common functional features for recruiting other protein factors to ensure that transcription is efficiently reactivated at the onset of each cell cycle. it will therefore be worth exploring other similar protein factors and their memory functions in order to elucidate cellular memory mechanisms.

the binding to dna of many protein factors involved in the regulation of gene expression often depends on alteration of the local chromatin structure, mediated by post-translational modifications of the terminal residues of histones. as a result, different histone modifications segregate the chromatin into different territories. active chromatin regions are often hyperacetylated at histones h <dig> and h <dig> and hypermethylated at h3-k <dig> and h3-k <dig>  <cit> . however, active histone modifications are highly dynamic. when chromatin condenses during mitosis, therefore, do these modifications function as memory 'determinants' to mark different states of gene expression? in this study, we selected transcriptionally competent globin gene clusters and genes in different transcriptional states to investigate the potential role of four active histone modifications  as cellular memory markers during mitosis, using comparative chip analysis of both asynchronous and mitotic mel cell populations. in asynchronous cells, multiple combinations of the four histone modifications are located at the distant hss of the globin gene clusters and the gene promoter regions, and they mark different chromatin states of the genes. for example, fully activated c-myc and β-actin are hyperacetylated at both h <dig> and h <dig> and hyperdimethylated at h3-k4; incompletely activated hsp <dig> is hyperacetylated at both h <dig> and h <dig> and moderately dimethylated at h3-k4; potentially transcriptional α-globin and βmaj are moderately acetylated and dimethylated at h3-k4; the rna polymerase iii-transcribed gene 7sk is hyperacetylated at both h <dig> and h <dig> but not dimethylated at h3-k <dig>  both transcriptionally active and competent genes, including rna polymerase ii- and iii-transcribed genes, are all moderately methylated at h3-k <dig>  however, inactive genes have less of these active modifications. in mitotic cells, some active modifications, especially h <dig> acetylation and h3-k <dig> dimethylation, are well preserved on the mitotic chromosomes. these preserved active histone modifications provide epigenetic markers by which gene expression states and local chromatin states can be inherited through mitosis. for the distant regulatory elements, which play important roles in switching on many tissue- or developmental stage-specific genes and maintaining their normal transcription during development and differentiation, localized active histone modifications, together with certain transcription factors, also provide important memory markers for maintaining local chromatin states during mitosis and hence facilitating and stabilizing differentiation and development. moreover, the preserved epigenetic markers might contribute to create a unique chromatin conformation and provide a re-activating core for the resumption of transcription in the next cell cycle. they may also have roles in distinguishing transcriptionally active from repressed regions, even in the absence of trans-acting factors, at the onset of the next cell cycle.

moreover, active modifications such as h3-k <dig> methylation and h <dig> acetylation are enriched in the h <dig>  variant of drosophila. in contrast, h3-k <dig> dimethylation, the marker for repressed genes, is enriched in h <dig>  <cit> . another recent study showed that h <dig>  is enriched in the promoters of active genes  <cit> . using the mouse λ5-vpreb <dig> locus as a model system, immuno-fish analysis of mitotic cells revealed that h <dig>  is strongly marked at the active λ <dig> gene on metaphase chromosomes. moreover, this region is hyperacetylated at h3-k <dig> and -k <dig> and di- and tri-methylated at h3-k <dig>  <cit> . these results strongly suggest that during mitosis, h <dig>  might function as another epigenetic memory marker for maintaining transcriptionally active states along with active histone modification. nevertheless, our speculation needs to be verified by testing more gene loci. it was also found that h <dig>  incorporation into chromatin and its removal from chromatin depend on transcription  <cit> . therefore, it will be worth exploring how h <dig>  coordinates with multiple active histone modifications to mediate transcriptional memory.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that both specific transacting factors and active histone modifications could function as cellular memory markers for competent and active genes during mitosis, and could serve as a reactivated core for the resumption of transcription after the cells exit mitosis.
