BACKGROUND
cattle, part of the cetartiodactyl order of eutherian mammals  <cit> , is an important source of human nutrition worldwide as well as the most studied ruminant model of metabolism, reproduction, and disease  <cit> . following the milestone publication of the cattle genome assembly along with annotation of functional elements and variation  <cit> , we are now enabled to search for genomic regions that impact the genetic variation of important phenotypic traits.

genomic structural variation, including insertions, duplications, deletions, inversions and translocations of dna, has long been known to be present in animal genomes  <cit>  but had predominantly been assumed to be to rare events and often associated with disease. this notion changed in  <dig> when two groups of researchers published the first genome-wide maps of copy number variation in seemingly healthy individuals  <cit> . copy number variant  is described as a segment of dna > =  <dig> kb that is copy number variable when compared with a reference genome  <cit> . before these landmark studies, it was thought that snps were the major source of genetic variation between individuals  <cit>  but genomic structural genetic variation is now known to cover more base pairs  <cit> , and to have a higher per-locus mutation rate than snps do  <cit> .

there are indications that cnvs appear throughout the genome not only in humans, but also in other primates  <cit> , rodents  <cit> , flies  <cit> , dogs  <cit> , chickens  <cit>  and cattle  <cit> . nevertheless, other than humans and mice  <cit> , little is known about how cnvs contribute to normal phenotypic variation and disease susceptibility. up until now, relatively few studies have confirmed the presence of cnvs in cattle  <cit> , of which only one study focused on genome-wide detection of cnvs  <cit> , but at low resolution using version  <dig> of bovine genome assembly  <cit> .

here we report the use of high-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization  to identify  <dig> cnv regions in  <dig> animals . with an average probe spacing of  <dig> bp relative to the latest bovine genome assembly   <cit> , this analysis provides the highest-resolution map of copy number variation in the cattle genome to date.

RESULTS
experiment design
the goal of our study was to characterize levels and patterns of copy number variation among bovine animals. therefore, to assess the bovine cnv landscape, the genomic dna of  <dig> bovine samples from two dairy  and two beef breeds  were analyzed. assessment of copy number variation between samples was done using a set of nimblegen hd <dig> cgh arrays that tile across the genome with approximately  <dig>  million unique oligo probes with a mean probe spacing of  <dig> bp, using the latest genome assembly   <cit> .

we opted for a dye-swap loop array design, rather than a common reference design, so that each sample was hybridized to two different samples in two different dye orientations. dye swap is used to compensate for dye bias, while the loop design  is applied to help assign the cnv gain and loss status more accurately for each sample based on the number of samples with the cnv.

array cgh evaluation
for evaluation of our array cgh platform, four sex-mismatched arrays and one self-self hybridization  were used to assess the false positive rate . probes were interpreted as revealing a copy-number difference if the standard error of the log-intensity ratio was beyond an intensity-ratio threshold. the adequacy of this threshold in detecting copy-number differences was confirmed by conducting sex-mismatched hybridizations, comparing the number of x-linked probes beyond the threshold. from the  <dig>  mb length of chromosome x,  <dig>  mb were greater than the threshold, yielding an estimate of  <dig> % for the rate of false positives . the false positive rate  is conservatively overestimated due to:  the assumption that there are no cnvs in the chromosome x of sex-mismatched arrays;  calling for fp was done at individual arrays rather than if they were detected in both dye swaps;  and because the self-self hybridization array yielded much lower fpr at individual array calling , and zero fpr when calling cnvs detected in both dye swap.

pattern and frequency of cnv regions
since copy-number changes are relative for array cgh data, unambiguous ascertainment of the ancestral state of a cnv and  identification of duplications and deletions is challenging. we have therefore chosen a design where a dye swap is coupled with a loop design, with each animal sample hybridized with two other animal samples, enabling us to distinguish between a deletion and duplication as well as the animal origin of the cnv . since identical cnvs, when called in different animals, might be assigned different boundaries due to technical and/or biological sources of variability, overlapping cnvs were handled as a whole and named copy number variable regions   <cit> .

after applying a stringent cnv calling pipeline with a theoretical  <dig>  kb resolution for cnv detection ,  <dig> putative cnvrs were identified, averaging  <dig> cnvs per animal , with 70%  of the cnvrs observed in more than one animal. although cnvrs detected in more than one animal of different families and/or breeds could be defined as frequent, the relationship between some of the animals precludes such classification . the relatively poor breakpoint estimation also prevents information regarding whether these cnvrs are identical-by-descent , or separate events occurred independently in different breeds .

cnvrs were detected on all chromosomes, but were distributed throughout the genome in a non-random manner  with little correlation between cnvrs occurrence and chromosome length . this is coherent with previous studies on heterogeneous distribution of cnvs in primates  <cit> , but the low number of samples used in this study prevents us from drawing any conclusions regarding putative genomic cnv hotspots.

out of the total number of cnvrs detected,  <dig> %  partially overlap gaps in the assembly , which indicates that the cnvrs have a high probability of being linked with gaps within the reference cattle genome assembly . this stresses the need for unraveling of these genomic regions of high structural complexity. the cnvrs detected vary in size from  <dig>  kb to  <dig> mb with a median size of  <dig>  kb, and encompass approximately  <dig> mb or  <dig> % of the bovine genome . the biggest region showing copy loss is  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> in animal  <dig>  while the biggest region showing copy number gain was detected in animals  <dig> and  <dig> showing a  <dig> kb amplification without overlapping any gene nor sd .

when comparing the size distribution between the  <dig> losses and the  <dig> gains, no significant difference was found , although we detected significantly more losses than gains . this bias in detecting more deletions could be due to both biological and technical reasons. one of the main mechanisms responsible for the cnv formation, non-allelic homologous recombination , has been shown to generate more deletions than duplications  <cit> . as also noted by others  <cit> , a technical bias favoring the detection of deletions may be responsible since our cnv detection pipeline have more power to detect a loss  = -1) than a gain  =  <dig> ). with 69% of the cnvrs described within  <dig> kb in size , it should be noted that a significant proportion of the cnvs are near our effective resolution of  <dig>  kb. this indicates that the experimental detection of  <dig> cnvrs may greatly underestimate the actual number of cnvs in the cattle genome, and that a substantial proportion of cnvs could be smaller than  <dig>  kb in size. cnvs > <dig> mb in size were not detected, which may be a consequence of the number and size of sequence gaps in the current outline of the cattle genome sequence assembly .

when assessing hybridization signals in the unassembled chromosome , it was verified that only the male vs. female hybridizations were detecting cnvs in some regions. although the number of females in this study is small , the findings suggest that these regions may be from the bovine chr y . it is known that the bos taurus genome assembly was not only composed by a female animal, but also had a bac library sequenced from a male animal, from which the corresponding y chromosome scaffolds were unlabeled and placed in the chrun  <cit> . consequently, this study highlights regions for future genome assembly improvements.

in accordance with analyses conducted in humans  <cit> , we detected that the gc content of the cnvrs  are slightly larger than of the whole genome , which supports the notion that cnvs arise more often in gc rich regions.

sds are associated with cnvs
segmental duplications , defined as regions of length > =  <dig> kb with at least 90% sequence identity  <cit> , are important elements in the formation of cnvs via non-allelic homologous recombination  throughout the mammalian lineage  <cit> . to test whether the non-random association between cnvs and sds was preserved in our high-resolution data, the overlap of cnvs with segmental duplications was determined. segmental duplications were overlapped by 20%  of the cnvrs, which implies that cnvs are enriched near segmental duplication . it should be noted that the enrichment is increased when testing only the cnvrs bigger than  <dig> kb, with segmental duplications overlapping 47% of those cnvrs. this is also consistent with previous cnv studies reporting a stronger association between segmental duplications and long cnvrs  <cit> .

functional analysis
nearly 30%  of the cnvrs encompassed  <dig> full-length genes as annotated in ensembl  <cit>  , but contrary to segmental duplications, the enrichment of cnvrs in genic areas is not significant. this indicates that the gene content of the cnvrs does not significantly differ from the whole bovine genome. the fact that none of the  <dig> ultraconserved elements  <cit> , nor the  <dig> new long conserved noncoding sequences in vertebrates  <cit> , were found in the cnv regions , further supports the notion that cnvs are significantly depleted in highly conserved functional elements.

in order to determine the likely biological effects of the  <dig> copy number variant genes, a gene ontology  analysis was performed with the easygo tool  <cit> . genes that were not completely included within the cnvrs were excluded from the go analysis, since the breakpoint definition of cnvrs can be equivocal  <cit> . table  <dig> shows that genes involved in environmental response are over-represented in the bovine cnvrs, as also seen in other studies of mammalian genomes  <cit> .

the following step was to test if genes unaffected by cnvs exhibited a different selective constraint than the ones affected. to test this, the dn/ds ratios for orthologous genes between the cow and human species were compared . knowing that dn is the number of nucleotide differences per non synonymous site and ds the number of nucleotide differences per synonymous site, dn/ds <  <dig> suggests that amino acid change is selectively constrained , while dn/ds ≥  <dig> suggests a relaxation of that same selection . it was determined that both deleted and duplicated genes have dn/ds ratios significantly higher than those for non-polymorphic genes. this result, as for the over represented set of 'environmental response' genes, might indicate a relaxation of constrains due to the redundancy expected from the variable number of gene copies  <cit> .

dn - nonsynonymous rate; ds - synonymous rate; p-value compares cnv genes with monomorphic genes.

when examining the human orthologs for the cattle genes  <cit>  affected by cnv, we studied  <dig> human ortholog genes of which  <dig> overlap with the genomic coordinates of previously reported human structural variation, as seen in the database of genomic variants   <cit> . since it is unlikely that cnvs in the human-cow common ancestor would have been conserved, the overlapping cnvs most probably reflect the existence of orthologous genomic regions of structural instability that are prone to recurrently generate polymorphisms in both species. however, this may also indicate that the cnvs annotated in dgv, being derived using different technological and analytical platforms, have a large variance in cnv resolution which may overestimate cnv sizes  <cit> . consequently, even if the annotated cnvs represent true structural variation it is difficult to estimate the actual boundaries of the cnv and subsequently the overlap of dgv cnvs with the cnvs identified here.

cnv affecting genes associated with disease
querying for copy number variant genes that had an orthologous human gene with omim morbid id reference  <cit> , revealed that  <dig> of these genes have been associated in human disease . likewise, when probing orthologous human genes involved in genome-wide association studies   <cit> ,  <dig> genes associated with human disease traits were found . we also queried the animal qtl database  <cit>  that holds publicly available qtl data on livestock species. retrieving all the bovine qtls within  <dig> mb of our cnvrs resulted in  <dig> qtls, which can hold putative valuable information for some important traits of interest . the database of online mendelian inheritance in animals   <cit>  was also queried, and  <dig> cow phenotypes within  <dig> mb of cnvrs were retrieved .

comparison with other mammalian cnv studies
next, we compared the number of cnvrs detected here with cnvrs from other studies . to minimize technical cnv detection biases we:  used data only from the same platform ,  used data from the highest resolution genome-wide survey published on each species queried and  required that the study was non biased to any particular genomic region. the main finding of this comparison is that an increased resolution of the array platform increases the number of detected cnvs. this supports our finding that the bulk of cnvs in mammalian genomes are small events, implying that the characterization of the mammalian cnv landscape is far from complete. a comparison with other non-human cnv studies shows that the number of cnvrs/sample does not follow the same trend. this is expected since we have employed a number of related animals as well as the overall genetic variation in cattle is known to be reduced relative to mouse and man. another contributing factor might be that our stringent cnv calling criteria hampers the detection of putative true cnvs. concerning the platform used to assess cnvs in humans  <cit> ; with a resolution to find cnvs  <dig> times bigger than ours, a similar difference when detecting cnvr/sample would be expected. this is not the case because cnv counts are known to be inversely proportional to their size, as seen here and elsewhere .

mean size, mean spacing and resolution are given in kilobases .

validation of the cnvrs
to evaluate the accuracy of the copy number assignments, quantitative real time-pcr was used as described previously  <cit> . briefly, two control regions, one site on the x chromosome and one site on an autosome, plus ten potential cnv regions were selected. six quantitative pcrs immediately confirmed the existence of copy number variation in these regions , whereas primer sets in four regions did not work satisfactorily . primer sets were therefore re-designed within these four cnv regions, and using these new primers the pcr reactions were performed successfully. thus, the existence of copy number variation in all ten regions was confirmed by quantitative pcr.

discussion
the study outlined in this paper yields the highest-resolution analysis of bovine cnvs to date. using a genome-wide tiling oligo array cgh, the largest number of cnv regions yet reported in cattle  have been identified. almost all  of the cnv regions discovered here are novel relative to previous reports  <cit> , thereby vastly expanding our insight of genome structural variation in cattle. with an effective resolution of  <dig>  kb in detecting cnvs, resulting in a median cnv size of  <dig>  kb, our data shows that at least  <dig> % of the cattle genome can vary in copy number in seemingly healthy animals. this is most probably an underestimate of the true genomic fraction that is tolerant to copy number due to the low number of animals sampled and their close relatedness.

as detected previously, not only in cattle  <cit>  but also in other species  <cit> , cnvs are strongly associated with segmental duplications . this sd relation creates a lack of probe coverage in and around duplicated sequences  <cit> , which significantly hampers the applicability of genome-wide association studies using snp arrays to tag sds-driven cnvs.

in addition, our data suggests that smaller cnvs  are much more frequent than larger ones, which is in agreement with other high resolution studies  <cit> . if this can be extrapolated for the whole cattle genome, the commercially available illumina  <dig> k snp panel  would not be sufficient to detect the bulk of existing cnvs. consequently, further characterization of cattle cnvs should be done with similar high-density array cgh or using next-generation sequencing technologies. the latter identifies a more complete size and class ranges of structural variation  <cit> .

as previously shown, copy number variants can have an impact on phenotypic variation mainly due to gene-dosage effects  <cit> , and are often associated with disease susceptibility  <cit> . in this analysis, cnvrs were found to be enriched for genes with functions related to environmental response, such as immune and sensory functions previously noticed in other species  <cit> . the enrichment aspect is an interesting finding, since variation in immunity related genes have been associated with disease. in particular, genes of the major histocompatibility complex  http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/mhc/, of which some are included in our dataset, are reported to be responsible for differences in predisposition to diseases like mastitis, dermatophilosis and other tick infections  <cit> . concerning the genetics of milk production and lactation, we found none of the  <dig> unique milk protein genes and the over  <dig> mammary-related genes within our cnv regions. this is expected since these genes are known to be highly conserved and evolving more slowly than other genes in the bovine genome  <cit> .

many genes and qtls associated with human and cow diseases were found to be copy number variable or located nearby cnv regions. the fact that some bovine cnvs occurred in regions orthologous to human cnvs, reflect most likely recurrent cnv formation, rather than ancestral cnvs maintained in both species. these regions could be hotspots of cnv genesis due to their fragile structural architecture that prompts frequent rearrangements.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the data presented here extends and establish the fact that a significant part of cattle genome is copy number variable within and between breeds and that our high-resolution array cgh is a valid method to detect bovine cnvs in a genome-wide manner. with a limited amount of sampled animals and breeds, and a stringent cnv calling criteria, the cnv regions reported here are believed to be highly reliable, but the number might greatly underestimate true number of cnvs in cattle populations. consequently, future studies are required to assess the functional significance of cnvs and their impact on health and productive efficiency in cattle.
