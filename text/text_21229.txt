BACKGROUND
klebsiella pneumoniae is a common gram-negative enteric bacterium that causes hospital-acquired urinary tract infection, septicemia, and pneumonia as well as community-acquired pneumonia. recently, community-acquired pyogenic liver abscess  caused by k. pneumoniae complicated with metastatic meningitis and endophthalmitis has emerged globally especially in asia . based on analysis of data from the national health insurance database in taiwan, cases of pla per year have increased from  <dig>  in  <dig> to  <dig>  in  <dig>  <cit> . among the  <dig> case-patients with pla admitted to national taiwan university hospital  from  <dig> through  <dig>   <dig> case-patients had positive culture results, and  <dig>  of these  <dig> case-patients had positive culture results showing k. pneumoniae infection  <cit> . in a nationwide prospective study of pla in korea, k. pneumoniae was the most common etiologic organism   <cit> . k. pneumoniae was also reported as the most common etiological organism of pla in new york, hong kong, singapore, and australia . the mortality rates were 10% among those with k. pneumoniae-caused pla and 30–40% among those with metastatic meningitis. the survivors of meningitis usually had severe neurological sequelae and k. pneumoniae endophthalmitis usually resulting in blindness of the affected eyes.

a previous study identified the predictors of septic metastatic infection and mortality among patients with k. pneumoniae liver abscess  <cit> . most of the severe complications occurred within the first  <dig> days after hospital admission. percutaneous drainage of primary liver abscess caused by k. pneumoniae lowered rates of mortality, metastatic infection, and complications. a previous study also observed that timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is a major determinant of survival and neurological outcome for patients with k. pneumoniae meningitis  <cit> . therefore, rapid diagnosis and proper treatment for this invasive disease are required.

when a bacterial infection is suspected because of symptoms  and increased white blood cell counts, the standard procedure in hospitals is to isolate and identify the bacterium. identification of k. pneumoniae using automated or manual biochemical tests requires at least  <dig> to  <dig> hours. however, identification through molecular or immunologic techniques of bacterial nucleic acid and antigen detection can accelerate the diagnosis of bacterial infectious diseases. a real-time pcr assay with specific primers and hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna gene was developed for the direct detection of k. pneumoniae from positive blood culture bottles  <cit> . but this method still requires culture enrichment.

in this study, we used a proteomic strategy to identify an immunodominant protein in k. pneumoniae strains causing pla and evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of an immunoblot method for detecting antibodies to this antigen in patient sera.

methods
ethics statement
all the clinical bacterial strains used in this study were provided by the strain collection of national taiwan university hospital  in taiwan. the ethics committee approved that no formal ethical approval was needed to use these clinically obtained materials, because the strains were remnant from patient samples, and the data were analyzed anonymously. the collection and study of serum samples in this study was approved by the institutional review board of ntuh and written informed consent was obtained from each participant . all animal experiments followed the guidelines in the handbook of laboratory animal care of the national laboratory animal breeding and research center, national science council of taiwan, and were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the national taiwan university college of medicine .

bacterial strains and culture conditions
the  <dig> k. pneumoniae clinical isolates used in this study were collected from ntuh from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . forty-two were pla strains isolated from the blood of patients with pla with or without meningitis or endophthalmitis complications, and  <dig> were non-tissue-invasive strains isolated from patients with sepsis but not pla or other metastatic infections in any tissue. k. pneumoniae and escherichia coli were cultured in lb medium at 37°c supplemented with appropriate antibiotics, including  <dig> μg/ml kanamycin and  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin.

serum samples
the serum samples from fourteen patients with k. pneumoniae pla and three patients with non-k. pneumoniae liver abscess were obtained from ntuh in 2008 ~  <dig>  the dates of admission and sera collection were recorded. the diagnosis of liver abscess was confirmed by abdominal sonography or computed tomography, as well as isolation and identification of the pathogens from blood or abscess aspiration. the serum samples from twelve patients with k. pneumoniae infections  were obtained from taipei veterans general hospital  in  <dig>  the diagnosis was based on clinical presentations and history.

purification of secreted proteins
ntuh-k <dig> strain was cultured overnight and pelleted by centrifugation. the culture supernatant was collected and  <dig> -μm filtered. the secreted proteins were precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final 20% concentration and incubating on ice for  <dig> minutes, collected after centrifugation, washed several times with cold acetone, air-dried, dissolved in  <dig>  m tris-cl , and assayed to determine protein concentration using the bradford method.

two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting
the proteins  were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. briefly, protein extract in sample buffer  was first separated on ipg strips , then on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate -polyacrylamide gels , and the separated proteins were transferred onto a poly fluoride  membrane . the membrane was incubated with blocking buffer  for  <dig> h at room temperature, primary antibody , secondary antibody , and then enhanced chemiluminescence  reagent.

liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  analysis
the protein spots on the coomassie blue stained two-dimensional gel were excised and digested by trypsin. the peptide mixture was analyzed using a nanoacquity system  connected to an ltq-orbitrap elite hybrid mass spectrometer  equipped with a nanospray interface .

expression and purification of recombinant kp1_p <dig> protein
kp1_p <dig> gene was amplified by pcr using primers kpp307-074f  and kpp307-916r  and then cloned into a pgem-t easy plasmid. the kp1_p <dig> was sub-cloned into the klenow fragment blunting-ecori site of a pgex-4t- <dig> plasmid. the resulting plasmid was transformed into e. coli dh10b. kp1_p <dig> gene was amplified by pcr using primers kpp307-076f  and kpp307r  and cloned into the blunt-end smai site of a pqe <dig> plasmid. the resulting plasmid was transformed into e. coli m15/prep <dig>  the recombinant gst-fused kp1_p <dig> protein and his-tagged kp1_p <dig> protein were expressed under  <dig> mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside  induction at 37°c and purified per the manufacturer’s instructions. the immuno-reactivities to gst-fused kp1_p <dig> protein and his-tagged kp1_p <dig> protein were not different. however, the yield of purified his-tagged kp1_p <dig> protein was higher than that of purified gst-fused kp1_p <dig> protein because his-tagged protein  could be purified under denaturing condition. therefore, we used the his-tagged kp1_p <dig> protein for further examination of the diagnostic application of kp1_p <dig> protein.

knockout of kp1_p307
the kp1_p <dig> gene and its flanking regions were amplified by pcr using primers 307ko-f  and 307ko-r . nucleotides 64– <dig> of the kp1_p <dig> coding sequence were replaced by a kanamycin resistant gene. the deletion fragment was then cloned into the suicide vector put containing a spectinomycin resistant gene as a selective marker to distinguish between single and double crossovers for chromosomal integration  <cit> . the resulting plasmid was transferred to ntuh-k <dig> by conjugation. chromosomal deletion of the kp1_p <dig> mutant was confirmed by pcr with different primer pairs.

virulence assay in mice
female 5-week-old balb/cbyl mice were inoculated with k. pneumoniae intraperitoneally as previously described  <cit> . four mice were used to test the effects of each inoculum. after inoculation, the mice were observed for  <dig> days. the ld <dig> was calculated using the method established by reed and muench. for in vivo competition, the kp1_p <dig> mutant strain and the fully virulent placz deletion mutant strain in the logarithmic phase were mixed at a 1: <dig> ratio  in saline, and inoculated intraperitoneally into eight 5-week-old balb/c mice as previously described  <cit> . the amounts of bacteria in livers and spleens one day after inoculation were determined by plating serial dilutions onto lb agar containing  <dig> mmol/l iptg and  <dig> mg/ml x-gal. in vivo competition was assessed using the competitive index .

immunoblotting of recombinant kp1_p <dig> protein with patient sera
the purified recombinant his-tag kp1_p <dig> protein was separated on 12% sds-page  and then transferred onto a membrane. patients’ sera  were screened simultaneously using mini-protean ii multiscreen apparatus . those collected first were screened first, and immunoblotting with serial sera was performed when the first collected serum was antibody negative.

capsular typing by wzc sequencing
capsular types of the k. pneumoniae strains were determined by wzc genotyping  <cit> . the sequences of cd1-vr2-cd <dig> region were compared with those of reference strains by ncbi-nucleotide blast and the corresponding capsular types were determined.

RESULTS
identification of immunodominant proteins in ntuh-k <dig> strain
proteins released by bacteria to the extracellular environment are usually the antigens that elicit immune responses, have diagnostic value, and can provide protective immunity. to identify immunodominant proteins in k. pneumoniae ntuh-k <dig> strain causing pyogenic liver abscess , the secreted proteins were isolated as described above and analyzed by immunoblotting using sera from one healthy subject and two patients in the convalescent phase of pla caused by k. pneumoniae . the convalescent sera from patients with k. pneumoniae pla were primarily used to identify immunodominant proteins secreted by k. pneumoniae strains causing pla. because sera obtained from patients in the convalescent stage were considered to be especially rich in antibodies against the infectious agent. a 30-kda band was recognized by the sera from the two patients but not the serum from the healthy subject. further separation by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with the above sera followed by coomassie blue staining  identified a similar band  that was immunoreactive with patients’ sera and therefore a possible candidate protein for immunological diagnosis of pla caused by k. pneumoniae.figure  <dig>

identification of the protein immunoreactive to sera from patients with pla
the protein spots on the two-dimensional gels were excised, digested by trypsin, and analyzed by lc-ms/ms. the obtained peptide sequences were compared with the whole genome sequences of ntuh-k <dig> strain . a 921-bp open reading frame  located on the large plasmid pk <dig> was confirmed. the sequences of peptides obtained from lc-ms/ms represented  <dig> % of kp1_p <dig> protein sequences. the theoretical pi and molecular weight of kp1_p <dig> protein  matched those of the immunoreactive protein. the amino acid sequences of kp1_p <dig> revealed 47%  identity to a hypothetical protein of lactobacillus rossiae  and 53%  identity to a hypothetical protein of enterococcus dispar . bioinformatic analysis revealed that this protein contained a signal peptide located at n-terminal residues  <dig> to  <dig> but had no known function.

confirmation of the immunoreactivity of kp1_p <dig> protein
the recombinant gst-kp1_p <dig> protein was expressed and purified in e. coli to confirm its immunoreactivity. sera from another four patients with pla and three healthy subjects were used to immunoblot the recombinant gst-kp1_p <dig> protein. the gst-kp1_p <dig> protein was immunoreactive with sera from patients but not from healthy subjects . the immunoreactive signal of the secreted proteins disappeared when the immunoreactive serum was pre-incubated with the recombinant gst-kp1_p <dig> protein but not with gst protein . these results confirmed that kp1_p <dig> protein was the candidate protein identified above.figure  <dig>

prevalence of strains with kp1_p307
the prevalence of pla strains and non-tissue invasive strains with kp1_p <dig> was determined by pcr and western blotting using rabbit anti-kp1_p <dig> serum . the results of pcr and western blotting were consistent. the prevalence of pla strains with kp1_p <dig>  was significantly higher than that of non-tissue invasive strains with kp1_p <dig>  . k <dig> and k <dig> were the most prevalent capsular types causing pla and were strongly associated with virulence. thirty-seven of the  <dig> pla strains were k1/k <dig>  whereas  <dig> of the  <dig> non–tissue-invasive strains were found to be k1/k <dig>  the prevalence of k1/k <dig> strains with kp1_p <dig>  was significantly higher than that of non-k1/k <dig> strains with kp1_p <dig>  . because this gene might be associated with bacterial virulence, a kp1_p <dig> knockout mutant of the ntuh-k <dig> strain was generated and its virulence was tested in mice. the survival of mice intraperitoneally infected with 1 ×  <dig> cfu of wild type or kp1_p <dig> knockout mutant was not significantly different . knockout of kp1_p <dig> did not increase the lethal dose  of ntuh-k <dig> strain given intraperitoneally. moreover, the in vivo competition between the wildtype and kp1_p <dig> knockout mutant strains was also not significantly affected .table  <dig>

diagnostic application of kp1_p <dig> protein in k. pneumoniae pla
sera from  <dig> patients with k. pneumoniae pla were collected to evaluate the diagnostic application of kp1_p <dig> protein . ten of the  <dig>  sera were immunoreactive with the recombinant kp1_p <dig> protein. because not all the pla strains have kp1_p <dig>  the isolates from the four patients whose sera did not react to the recombinant kp1_p <dig> protein were tested to determine whether they possess kp1_p <dig>  two out of these four strains did not have kp1_p <dig>  and therefore could not elicit these antibodies. moreover, sera from three patients with la not caused by k. pneumoniae and sera from ten healthy subjects were not immunoreactive with the recombinant kp1_p <dig> protein. therefore, presence of antibodies against the kp1_p <dig> protein can be implicated in k. pneumoniae pla.table  <dig>

antibodies against the kp1_p <dig> could be detected in the first serum sample  from eight of the ten patients with positive reactions. four of these eight patients had positive serological reactions to kp1_p <dig> protein on the first day after hospital admission . the other two patients  were observed to seroconvert  on the 5th and 10th day after admission, respectively, and to still have anti-kp1_p <dig> antibody  <dig> months after infection . these results confirm that the antibodies against the kp1_p <dig> protein were elicited after infections. therefore, the kp1_p <dig> protein could be used to serodiagnose k. pneumoniae pla.figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we identified an immunodominant antigen in a k. pneumoniae pla strain by a proteomic approach and evaluated its application to the serodiagnosis of k. pneumoniae pla. the sensitivity of k. pneumoniae pla detection was  <dig> %  and four out of six sera  collected on the first day of hospitalization for k. pneumoniae pla were positive for anti-kp1_p <dig> antibodies. our previous study indicated that 80% of patients with pla were caused by k. pneumoniae infection  <cit> . therefore, the case of non-k. pneumoniae pla was relatively few. we included serum samples from three patients with la not caused by k. pneumoniae and sera from ten healthy subjects to confirm the specificity. the results indicated that the specificity was 100% . the detection of antibodies against kp1_p <dig> protein could be performed directly using sera and did not require the cultivation of bacteria. although the sensitivity and specificity of this test still need to be confirmed by using a larger number of clinical samples, we suggest that detection of anti-kp1_p <dig> antibody was considered to be an easy and rapid method for early screening of k. pneumoniae pla. as shown in figure  <dig>  patient i was observed to still have anti-kp1_p <dig> antibody  <dig> months after infection , therefore antibody titers could persisted for months after successful treatment. if the antibodies persist, the kp1_p <dig> antigen could not be used in the diagnosis of k. pneumoniae re-infection. however, because we did not have adequate follow-up sera, how long the anti-kp1_p <dig> antibodies persisted could not be determined.

the kp1_p <dig> protein was predicted to have a signal peptide similar to that of the kp1_p <dig> protein present in the fraction secreted from bacteria. the amino acid sequences of kp1_p <dig> revealed approximately 50% identity to a hypothetical protein of l. rossiae and a hypothetical protein of e. dispar. hence, the cross-reactivity of antibodies against l. rossiae and e. dispar to kp1_p <dig> protein may occur. however, the infections caused by l. rossiae and e. dispar were extremely rare. there were neither l. rossiae nor e. dispar isolates in the bacteria collection of ntuh, taipei vgh and chang gung memorial hospital, thus we have difficulties to examine the crossreactivity. but, we expected that the possible crossreactivity would not interfere in the application of kp1_p <dig> to the serodiagnosis of k. pneumoniae pla. moreover, the function of kp1_p <dig> protein remains unknown and difficult to study. although the presence of this protein was correlated with k. pneumoniae pla, knock out of kp1_p <dig> did not decrease the virulence of k. pneumoniae ntuh-k <dig> strain in mice even its in vivo ability to compete with wild type strain. our preliminary result demonstrated that the anti-kp1_p <dig> antibodies could not block the infection of k. pneumoniae ntuh-k <dig> strain in mice . further investigation of the functions of kp1_p <dig> protein and anti-kp1_p <dig> antibody is still needed.

previous studies have demonstrated the correlation of the virulence o f k. pneumoniae k <dig> strains with the presence of aerobactin  <cit> . our previous study also reported that p-rmpa gene  was associated with k. pneumoniae pla  <cit> . however, knockout of the iuc region  or p-rmpa did not decrease its virulence in mice  <cit> . here, the kp1_p <dig> was also associated with k. pneumoniae pla, but knockout of this gene had no influence on virulence. because these genes  are all located on the large plasmid and associated with bacterial virulence, we propose that other virulence factors might be present in the large plasmid of k. pneumoniae. these genes could serve as markers of bacterial virulence due to their co-inheritance together with virulence genes carried by this plasmid.

as shown in table  <dig>  the presence of kp1_p <dig> was also correlated with capsular type k1/k <dig>  the k. pneumoniae strains with capsular types k <dig> and k <dig> are more virulent than those with other capsular types  <cit> . therefore, the kp1_p <dig> can be used to detect not only k. pneumoniae pla but also possibly other infections caused by capsular type k1/k <dig> strains. the majority of k. pneumoniae pla strains were capsular type k <dig> and k <dig>  <cit> . but we did not obtain all the k. pneumoniae strains isolated from these  <dig> pla patients in this study ; consequently the capsular types of these isolates were unknown. besides pla, the diagnostic application of kp1_p <dig> protein in k. pneumoniae other infections was also examined. all strains with k <dig> or k <dig> capsular type possess kp1_p <dig> gene and  <dig> % of non-k1/k <dig> strains also have kp1_p <dig>  but only 50% of sera collected from patients infected with kp1_p307-positive k. pneumoniae strains were immunoreactive with kp1_p <dig> protein. because these sera samples were collected at the first day when the patients visited the hospital, the anti- kp1_p <dig> antibodies may not yet be elicited at this very early time point. these results demonstrated that the detection of anti-kp1_p <dig> antibody implicated the infections by several capsular types  of k. pneumoniae which carry a virulent plasmid.

there are several immunogenic antigens of k. pneumoniae, such as ompa and ompk <dig> etc., have been reported previously  <cit> . the immuno-reactivity to ompk <dig> of sera obtained from pla patients was also examined. but the sera samples from all the k. pneumoniae pla patients were not immuno-reactive to the recombinant ompk <dig> protein . we speculated that ompk <dig> antigen located on the outer membrane might be masked by capsule and might not be exposed, because the strains causing pla were observed to be heavily encapsulated  <cit> . the antibodies against ompk <dig> might be produced at a later stage or might not be elicited during k. pneumoniae pla infections. moreover, ompk <dig> protein is commonly distributed among k. pneumoniae strains and has sequence similarity to that of e. coli. these results indicated that kp1_p <dig> would be a better antigen than ompk <dig> to serodiagnose k. pneumoniae pla.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, an immunodominant antigen, kp1_p <dig>  was identified in a k. pneumoniae strain causing pla. the kp1_p <dig> gene was located on the large plasmid and more prevalent in pla strains and capsular type k1/k <dig> strains, but deletion of kp1_p <dig> did not decrease the virulence of this strain in mice. the high sensitivity and specificity demonstrated here indicates that the kp1_p <dig> protein could be used to serodiagnose k. pneumoniae pla or other infections.
