BACKGROUND
the heat shock response in pathogenic bacteria is induced by a large variety of stresses including heat and the host immunodefence system  <cit> . transcription of heat shock genes under stress conditions in gram-negative bacteria is induced by the heat shock transcription factor σ <dig>  encoded by rpoh  <cit> . small heat shock proteins  protect the system against the irreversible aggregation of non-native proteins and assist in their refolding by major cytosolic chaperones such as the clpb-hsp <dig> chaperone system and groel/groes  <cit> . most of the members of the enterobacteriaceae family have two conserved shsps, ibpa and ibpb  <cit> . interestingly salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium has a third conserved shsp aggregation-suppressing protein   <cit> . agsa is a heat shock protein that is also believed to function as an effective cytosolic chaperone, because its overproduction partially complements the thermo-sensitive phenotype of the dnak null mutant, and it can prevent the aggregation of denatured proteins in dnak and rpoh null mutants. in s. enterica serovar typhimurium, agsa appears to play a role in survival at lethal temperatures by cooperating with other chaperones, including ibpa and ibpb.

members of the shsp family are found in most organisms. shsps and related α-crystallins comprise a superfamily of chaperones defined by:  a conserved domain of 80- <dig> amino acids , referred to as the α-crystallin domain;  a short c-terminal extension, flanking this domain;  an n-terminal arm of variable length and highly divergent sequence;  a molecular mass typically between 12- <dig> kda;  large oligomers of shsps, formed in their native state and  an atp independent chaperone activity  <cit> .

structural and biochemical studies have demonstrated that the α-crystallin domain is the basic building block of most shsps, and it is an important domain for the interaction between shsps and unfolded substrate proteins  <cit> . the crystal structures have been solved for methanococcus jannaschii hsp <dig>  and for wheat  hsp <dig>   <cit> . comparison of both structures has revealed that although the overall organisation of the complexes are different, both have dimer as their primary building block, and their α-crystallin domains form very similar igg-like β-sandwich folds  <cit> .

the n-terminal arm and c-terminal extension are believed to be important regions for regulating chaperone activity. the n-terminal arm is attached to one end of the α-crystallin domain, is variable in length and sequence among shsps and is thought to influence higher order oligomerisation, subunit dynamics and chaperone activity  <cit> . the c-terminal extension, a charged and highly flexible region, stabilises oligomers while mediating shsp solubility and chaperone activity  as well as being able to form bonds with other c-terminal extensions  <cit> .

the finding that agsa shares significant and overall homology to wheat shsp <dig>   suggests that biological and biochemical studies of agsa will inform research on both bacterial and eukaryotic shsps. therefore, we investigated the in vivo and in vitro chaperone activities of agsa and n- or c-terminal truncated agsa mutants using chemically- and heat-denatured substrates. from these studies, we elucidated that multiple regions are involved in the chaperone activity of agsa to different denatured substrates, and that the equilibrium between the oligomeric and dimeric forms appears to be important for efficient chaperone activity.

RESULTS
multiple alignment and structural model of agsa
multiple alignment of agsa to ibpa, ibpb and bovine α-crystallin showed that the α-crystallin domain of agsa was conserved but that the n-terminal arm and the c-terminal extension were variable . interestingly, with the exception of a portion of the c-terminal extension, agsa shared sufficient overall homology with wheat shsp <dig>  to allow prediction of its three-dimensional structure . the predicted structure of agsa showed that the n-terminal arm was composed of helices connected by a random coil, and that the α-crystallin domain consisted of igg-like β-sandwich folds together with the short c-terminal extension. the n-terminal arm and the c-terminal extension are important regions for oligomer formation and chaperone activity in several shsps although their contribution to these functions in agsa has not been determined. therefore, we constructed the following agsa n- or c-terminal truncated mutants:  Δn <dig>  truncated up to leucine- <dig> which is located in front of the gap region determined by its homology to bovine α-crystallin;  Δn <dig>  truncated up to proline- <dig> which is a conserved residue except in hsp <dig> ;  Δn <dig>  truncated up to leucine- <dig> which is conserved in all aligned shsps;  Δn <dig>  truncated up to asparagine- <dig> which is located in front of the α-helix of the n-terminal region;  Δn <dig>  truncated up to arginine- <dig> which contains half of the α-helix;  Δc <dig>  truncated from glutamic acid- <dig> which is located just after the conserved v/ixi/v motif where shsp form oligomeric complexes with the c-terminal extension by intermolecular interactions and  Δc <dig>  truncated from glutamic acid- <dig> resulting the elimination of the whole c-terminal extension.

in vivo chaperone activity of truncated agsa
to investigate whether truncation of the n-terminal arm or c-terminal extension of agsa decreases its chaperone activity, we examined the in vivo chaperone activity of truncated agsa by using the Δrpoh mutant  <cit> . this mutant lacks the heat shock transcription factor σ <dig> and is therefore largely devoid of all major cytosolic chaperones, except for groel/groes, and has lower levels of proteases  <cit> . the lack of chaperones and proteases results in a large accumulation of aggregated proteins, that is, approximately 10% of the total proteins were aggregated at 42°c . when wild type agsa was overexpressed in Δrpoh cells, the amount of aggregated proteins decreased to less than 1% of the total protein levels observed at 42°c. the overexpression levels of the truncated agsa by iptg induction in Δrpoh cells was found to be diverse : Δn <dig> only accumulated to approximately half the level of wild type agsa, while other truncated proteins  were produced to the same level as the wild type protein or higher . quantification of the amount of aggregated proteins in the truncated agsa-overexpressing Δrpoh cells revealed that aggregation was significantly prevented until the truncation of the 23rd aa of the n-terminus, while Δn <dig> did not show any chaperone activity. Δn <dig> showed weaker chaperone activity, although this was caused by its inefficient expression in Δrpoh cells. c-terminal deletions also affected the chaperone activity of agsa. Δc <dig> showed weaker chaperone activity than agsa, while Δc <dig> did not exhibit any chaperone activity. thus, truncated agsa demonstrated in vivo chaperone activity by the part from the 24th aa of the n-terminus to the 12nd aa of the c-terminus. we purified agsa, Δn <dig>  Δn <dig>  Δn <dig> and Δc <dig> to investigate their oligomeric state and chaperone activity in vitro. however, purified Δn <dig> tended to aggregate in our assay conditions preventing its use in the following experiments.

oligomeric status of n- or c-terminal truncated agsa
the effects of n- or c-terminal truncations on the agsa complex size under different temperatures were determined using size exclusion chromatography . the chromatograph for agsa showed a single peak at 25°c with a calculated apparent molecular mass of  <dig> kda, corresponding to a complex of approximately  <dig> subunits. the main peak fraction for agsa was located at the same position  until 50°c. however, the amount of agsa eluted in the lower molecular weight fractions gradually increased with increasing temperature. when sec was carried out at 60°c, agsa was found to largely dissociate and its molecular mass changed to approximately  <dig>  kda, corresponding to the middle size of monomer and dimer with broad shoulders. Δn <dig>  and Δn <dig> eluted in the large molecular weight fractions and exhibited a single peak corresponding to approximately  <dig> and  <dig> subunits at 25°c, respectively. in contrast to agsa, almost all Δn <dig> and Δn <dig> dissociated at 42°c and eluted as a single peak with broad downstream shoulders corresponding to the hexamer and tetramer, respectively. at 50°c Δn <dig> and Δn <dig> eluted in the fraction corresponding to the dimer. Δc <dig> could not form large oligomeric complexes and eluted in the lower molecular weight fractions, corresponding to the trimer at 25°c and dimer at 37°c and 42°c.

in vitro chaperone activity of agsa and its n- or c-terminal truncated mutants
chaperone activity of purified agsa and its n- or c-terminal truncated mutants was assayed by monitoring the ability to prevent the aggregation of chemically denatured substrates: lysozyme and insulin  or heat-denatured substrates: malate dehydrogenase  and citrate synthase  . we confirmed that in the absence of substrate agsa and the n- or c-terminal truncated mutants did not increase the turbidity by aggregation at our assay temperatures . we previously reported that the overproduction of agsa could reduce the amount of aggregated proteins in Δrpoh cells, even at a low temperature   <cit> . therefore, we examined the chaperone activities at 25°c of agsa and the n- or c-terminal truncated mutants for lysozyme . the addition of  <dig> μm agsa, Δn <dig> or Δn <dig> to  <dig> μm dtt-denatured lysozyme reduced the turbidity due to aggregated lysozyme by approximately 10% compared to the turbidity observed for lysozyme alone at 25°c. Δc <dig> showed weaker chaperone activity, since it was required at a higher concentration  in order to prevent the aggregation of lysozyme at 25°c. we observed effective chaperone activity for  <dig> μm agsa and the n-terminal truncated mutants at 37°c and 50°c. however, Δc <dig> did not show any chaperone activity at these temperatures. moreover, co-aggregation of Δc <dig> with lysozyme  resulted in more than a twofold increase in turbidity compared to lysozyme alone. these data suggested that the oligomeric structure or the c-terminal  <dig> aa was important for the chaperone activity of agsa preventing the aggregation of lysozyme. since agsa could form stable oligomeric structures at 25°c, the important region for its chaperone activity with lysozyme appeared to be localised to the outer surface of the oligomeric complex. this region might contribute to the in vivo chaperone activity of agsa that was observed in the Δrpoh mutant at 30°c.

athe percentage of turbidity showed the ratio of the turbidity of the dtt-denatured lysozyme  or insulin  with the indicated concentration of agsa or its mutants to the turbidity of the dtt-denatured lysozyme or insulin alone . values are the mean ± sd obtained from  <dig> independent experiments.

athe percentage of turbidity showed the ratio of the turbidity of heat-denatured mdh  or cs  with  <dig> μm agsa or its mutants to the turbidity of heat-denatured mdh or cs alone . values are the mean ± sd obtained from  <dig> independent experiments.

interestingly, when dtt-denatured insulin  was used as the substrate for agsa or Δc <dig> , Δc <dig> significantly prevented the aggregation of insulin at every temperature examined. however, agsa showed little or no chaperone activity at 25°c and 37°c. Δn <dig> enhanced chaperone activity for insulin and significantly prevented its aggregation at 25°c and 37°c. agsa and all truncated mutants demonstrated significant chaperone activity for insulin at 50°c. these results suggest that the important region for chaperone activity with insulin are located inside the oligomeric complex. destabilization of the oligomeric complex by c- or n-terminal truncations may expose this region to the outside, even at low temperatures. we further examined the interaction between denatured insulin and agsa or Δc <dig> using sec . since insulin has a small molecular weight , it was difficult to determine the eluted fraction using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . therefore, we introduced a fluorescein label onto insulin in order to monitor its elution profile. in the following experiments  <dig> μm of denatured fluorescein-labelled insulin could not form large aggregates and was eluted in the small molecular fractions . when insulin was denatured by dtt in the presence of agsa at 25°c, almost all of the fluorescent insulin was eluted in the small molecular fractions. when the same experiment was carried out at 50°c, significant amounts of insulin were co-eluted with agsa. these data are consistent with our hypothesis that the important region for the chaperone activity of agsa to insulin are located inside the oligomeric complex. however, we could not observe a significant interaction between denatured insulin and Δc <dig> at 25°c . the interaction between denatured insulin and Δc <dig> could be weak and this complex may dissociate during sec.

we also examined the chaperone activity of agsa and its truncated mutants by using heat-denatured mdh and cs . agsa  suppressed the aggregation of heat-denatured mdh  at 50°c and 60°c . there was a significant reduction of chaperone activity in Δn <dig> at 60°c. Δn <dig> did not show any significant chaperone activity with mdh at 50°c or 60°c, indicating that the n-terminal  <dig> aa residues contain a crucial region for the prevention of mdh aggregation. Δc <dig> prevented the aggregation of mdh at 50°c, although it displayed less activity than wild type agsa. however, Δc <dig> did not show any significant chaperone activity at 60°c. these results suggest that the chaperone activity of the dimer form of Δc <dig> may be sufficient to prevent the aggregation of denatured mdh at 50°c. in contrast, the oligomeric complex may be necessary for highly denatured mdh at 60°c.

agsa  prevented the aggregation of cs  from 42-60°c . in contrast to mdh, Δn <dig> and Δn <dig> possessed approximately the same level of chaperone activity as the wild type protein. therefore, the n-terminal  <dig> aa residues of agsa do not appear to have a crucial function for the prevention of cs aggregation. Δc <dig>  suppressed the aggregation of cs at 42°c. however, we observed a reduction in its chaperone activity in response to increases in the temperature. the ability of Δc <dig> to suppress cs aggregation was completely lost at 60°c and co-aggregation was observed for both proteins , as well as the case using lysozyme as the substrate. thus, the chaperone activity of the dimeric form of Δc <dig> was sufficient for locally denatured cs although the oligomeric complex seemed to be required for chaperone activity with highly denatured cs as well as mdh.

deletion of the c-terminal  <dig> aa caused the destabilization of the oligomeric structure  although the v/ixi/v motif, which is an important region for the formation of oligomeric shsps, was preserved. therefore, the addition of Δc <dig> to agsa might change the dynamic equilibrium between both dimer and oligomeric complex and overall chaperone activity. to investigate this possibility, equal amounts of agsa and Δc <dig> were mixed together . the mixture of agsa and Δc <dig> did not increase the turbidity in the absence of substrate by aggregation at our assayed temperatures . only half the amount of agsa or Δc <dig> required for efficient chaperone activity was used in the mixing experiment. for example,  <dig> % lysozyme aggregated in the presence of  <dig> μm agsa compared to lysozyme alone and  <dig> μm Δc <dig> co-aggregated with denatured lysozyme, increasing the turbidity to  <dig> % at 37°c. interestingly, a mixture of  <dig> μm agsa and Δc <dig> reduced the aggregation of lysozyme to  <dig> % at 37°c. this mixture also efficiently prevented the aggregation of insulin, and heat-denatured mdh and cs. given these results, we then performed titration experiments by changing the ratios of agsa to Δc <dig> in the mixture using lysozyme as a substrate . agsa prevented the aggregation of lysozyme. however, Δc <dig> was unable to prevent its aggregation above 37°c. so, the cooperative effect on chaperone activity with lysozyme was examined by changing the amount of agsa in the presence or absence of  <dig> μm Δc <dig> at 37°c. although  <dig> μm agsa was required to prevent the aggregation of lysozyme,  <dig> μm agsa showed significant chaperone activity with lysozyme when Δc <dig> was present. in contrast to lysozyme, Δc <dig> was required to prevent the aggregation of insulin at low temperatures. the cooperative effect on chaperone activity to insulin was examined by changing the amount of Δc <dig> in the presence or absence of  <dig> μm agsa at 25°c . we found that  <dig> μm Δc <dig> effectively prevented the aggregation of insulin when agsa was present, though  <dig> μm Δc <dig> was required for significant chaperone activity to lysozyme. these data clearly demonstrate that agsa and Δc <dig> can interact with and activate each other, cooperatively.

we further analysed the cooperative effect of mixing agsa and Δc <dig> on their interaction with insulin using sec . in the case of denatured insulin in the presence of agsa and Δc <dig> at 25°c, a significant amount of insulin was eluted in the fractions that corresponded to the agsa-insulin complex observed in figure 4a. these data suggest that Δc <dig> may affect the status of oligomeric complexes of agsa and denatured insulin could incorporate into the agsa oligomeric complexes.

determination of the interaction between agsa and Δc11
to monitor whether Δc <dig> could change the dynamic equilibrium between the dimer and the oligomeric complexes of agsa, we used sec and fluorescence resonance energy transfer  analysis to observe the interaction between agsa and Δc <dig> at 25°c . the cooperative effect of agsa and Δc <dig> on the complex size was determined using sec . equal amounts of agsa and Δc <dig> were mixed and then immediately separated by sec. the chromatograph of the mixture showed  <dig> peaks, corresponding to agsa  and Δc <dig> . when mixtures were incubated at 25°c for  <dig> h and then separated using sec, the size of the  <dig> kda peak corresponding to Δc <dig> was decreased and the size of the  <dig> kda peak corresponding to agsa was increased. these data suggest that Δc <dig> could associate with the agsa oligomeric complex and form hetero-oligomeric complexes.

we further examined the interaction between agsa and Δc <dig> using fret analysis . for this purpose, purified agsa and Δc <dig> were labelled with fluorescein  or rhodamine . a decrease in fluorescein fluorescence at  <dig> nm was not observed when fluorescein-labelled agsa and rhodamine-labelled agsa were mixed, indicating that there was no exchange reaction between the  <dig> labelled agsa subunits at 25°c. however, a significant exchange reaction was observed between the  <dig> labelled agsa subunits at 45°c, with a 40% decrease in fluorescence compared to only fluorescein-labelled agsa after  <dig> min . in contrast to agsa, mixing the  <dig> populations of labelled Δc <dig> resulted in a decrease in fluorescence at 25°c, indicating an exchange reaction bringing the  <dig> labelled Δc <dig> subunits close to each other. mixing fluorescein-labelled agsa and rhodamine-labelled Δc <dig> or fluorescein-labelled Δc <dig> and rhodamine-labelled agsa also resulted in a decrease in fluorescence. however, ibpb, which is an shsp and a major e. coli cytosolic chaperone  <cit> , did not exhibit a subunit exchange reaction with agsa . these data clearly indicated that Δc <dig> could promote agsa subunit exchange at 25°c.

overall our data suggest that Δc <dig> can change the dynamic equilibrium between the dimer and the oligomeric complexes of agsa, therefore, the mixture showed significant chaperone activity.

discussion
shsps are conserved across prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and most of these shsps form large oligomeric complexes. oligomeric shsps exhibit reduced chaperone activity at low temperatures and were believed to be the inactive form. at high temperatures, shsps de-oligomerise and show full chaperone activity. therefore, the chaperone activity of shsps was regulated by changing their oligomeric structure in response to changes in the surrounding temperature  <cit> . interestingly, agsa showed in vivo chaperone activity at 30°c  <cit> . nevertheless, it could form a stable oligomeric structure at low temperatures as shown in figure  <dig>  therefore, we examined the in vitro chaperone activity of agsa at low temperatures. in addition, n- or c-terminal truncated agsa were constructed to investigate the relationship between oligomer formation and chaperone activity.

our data showed that truncations up to the 23rd aa of the n-terminal arm or to the 11th aa from the c-terminus extension demonstrated significant chaperone activity in vivo . although purified Δn <dig> possessed in vitro chaperone activity in high ionic strength conditions , it aggregated in our assay conditions preventing us from examining its activity. the predicted α-helix region from the 17th to the 23rd aa of the n-terminal arm of agsa appeared to contain an important region for the correct assembly of the oligomeric structure. Δn <dig> and Δn <dig> could form oligomeric complexes at 25°c. however, they could not retain the large oligomeric structure at 42°c . thus, this region appears to strengthen the agsa oligomer structure. since Δc <dig> could not assemble in a large oligomer, the  <dig> aa after the v/ixi/v motif also appear to have an important function in maintaining the agsa oligomeric complex.

we further examined the in vitro chaperone activity of the n- or c-terminal truncated mutants. our results showed that the n-terminal  <dig> aa of agsa was a crucial region in preventing the aggregation of mdh, but not of other substrates . it has been demonstrated that the n-terminal arm of shsps is an important region for chaperone activity and substrate specificity using chimeras of all or part of the non-conserved n-terminal arm from pea hsp <dig>  and wheat hsp <dig> , and by cross-linking experiments between pea hsp <dig>  and its substrates  <cit> . the data presented in this study support these results; the n-terminal  <dig> aa of agsa was an important region for its chaperone activity on mdh. Δc <dig> only demonstrated chaperone activity with limited substrates and conditions, e.g. denatured insulin and partially denatured mdh and cs . however it possessed little or no chaperone activity towards denatured lysozyme or strongly denatured mdh and cs. these results suggest that the ability of agsa to form oligomeric complexes may be important for its chaperone activity with strongly denatured protein substrates.

interestingly, mixing of agsa and Δc <dig> compensated for the defects in their individual chaperone activities, e.g. agsa did not show efficient chaperone activity towards denatured insulin at low temperatures, and Δc <dig> showed weak chaperone activity towards denatured lysozyme and strongly denatured mdh and cs . titration experiments also showed that the chaperone activity increased in a positive-synergistic manner of agsa or Δc <dig> . these data strongly suggest that agsa and Δc <dig> can interact with each other and activate their chaperone activity cooperatively. inter-subunit exchanges among agsa complexes were not detected using fret analysis at 25°c, indicating that agsa can form a stable oligomeric structure . however, inter-subunit exchanges between agsa and Δc <dig> complexes were observed at this temperature. these results suggest that the dynamic equilibrium between the dimer and the oligomeric complex is important for the chaperone activity of agsa with wide substrates spectrum. does such an association exist in the cell? interestingly, shsps are preserved in many eukaryotes, i.e.  <dig> in caenorhabditis elegans and  <dig> in homo sapiens  <cit> . therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the interaction among different shsps could modulate their chaperone activity. mixing of different shsps may suggest us a possibility of the cellular functions of eukaryotic shsps. it has been reported that human shsps may contribute directly to muscle diseases, certain cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, such as alzheimer's and parkinson's disease  <cit> . increasing our knowledge of shsps by investigating the quality control mechanisms for the cellular targets of agsa may help us to understand the causes of such diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
agsa requires multiple regions for its chaperone activity: important region for denatured lysozyme are located outer surface of the oligomeric complex, for denatured insulin are located inside of the oligomeric complex and for denatured mdh are located in a  <dig> aa region of the n-terminal arm. Δc <dig> could not form large oligomeric complexes and did not show any chaperone activity towards strongly denatured substrates. therefore, the ability to form large oligomeric complex appears to be important for the chaperone activity of agsa. the mixing of agsa and Δc <dig> caused inter-subunit exchange in individual complex, compensated for the defects in individual chaperone activities demonstrating good chaperone activity for all of the substrates and temperatures examined. these results indicate that the dynamic equilibrium between the dimer and the oligomeric complex may be important for the efficient chaperone activity of agsa.
