BACKGROUND
most biological traits are complex, i.e. they are under the control of an interacting network of genes, each with a small effect, and of environmental factors such as nutrition  <cit> . metabolic regulation in complex organisms relies partly on transcriptional control as a long-term mechanism affecting the level of expression of key enzymes  <cit> . in rodents, there is high correlation between mrna expression of target genes and recruitment of lipogenic transcription factors or nuclear receptors and their co-regulatory proteins to promoter regions, suggesting that gene expression analysis is useful for inferring transcriptional activity  <cit> . transcriptional regulation of hepatic lipogenic gene expression, adipogenesis, and skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation in rodents is under control of sterol regulatory element binding factor  <dig>   <cit>  and the ligand-activated nuclear receptors pparγ  and pparδ   <cit> . less is known regarding the molecular events during skeletal muscle growth in livestock species such as cattle and pigs  <cit> . however, recent work has begun to explore large-scale transcriptomic adaptations in skeletal muscle of cattle in response to plane of nutrition  or age  <cit> . although mrna expression is one of multiple factors to be considered when studying the complex molecular networks working simultaneously in tissues of varying cell types  like skeletal muscle, it provides valid information to aid in designing more detailed functional studies.

young steer calves are relatively more efficient at converting nutrients to muscle gain  <cit> . weaning calves at an earlier age than the conventional  <dig> days is a management practice that has shown to enhance growth rate, modify carcass composition, and modify meat quality  <cit> . exposing them to high-starch diets at an early vs. conventional age could increase the likelihood that they reach their genetic potential to marble . to our knowledge, no studies have been conducted to examine the influence of dietary starch level at an early age on gene networks regulating pivotal pathways for desired phenotypes of economically-important traits. high-starch/low-fiber diets, through shifting the pattern of end-products of ruminal fermentation towards greater propionate, provide readily-available sources of energy  for growing muscle in early-weaning management systems  <cit> . a previous study with early-weaned angus × simmental steers reported greater intramuscular fat and backfat thickness at the end of the growing phase in animals fed a high-starch vs. high-fiber diet  <cit> . energy available for gain was ca. 35% greater in steers fed the high-starch diet, which undoubtedly contributed to enhanced fat deposition.

the central hypotheses of the present study were that adipogenic and energy metabolism gene networks in longissimus lumborum  muscle tissue during rapid post-weaning growth would be altered to different extents by genotype as well as feeding diets that varied in level of starch but provided similar amounts of energy for gain. thus, specific objectives were to study mrna expression of selected genes associated with insulin signaling and glucose transport, fatty acid uptake and activation, intracellular fatty acid transport, de novo fatty acid synthesis, esterification, desaturation, transcriptional regulation of adipogenesis and differentiation, and energy metabolism . these genes potentially compose a large interactive network  <cit>  controlling metabolism in cells of cattle ll tissue.

RESULTS
animal performance
a primary objective was to manipulate the profile of ruminal fermentation products  through feeding diets with different levels of starch and fiber. classical studies showed that intravenous infusions  of propionate or glucose  into steers promoted greater in vitro incorporation of glucose, acetate, and lactate into subcutaneous adipose tissue lipid  <cit> . this response was accompanied by greater fatty acid synthetase , acetyl-coa carboxylase-α , and atp-citrate lyase , as well as unchanged malate dehydrogenase  <dig>  nad   activity primarily when glucose was infused. the relative potency of substrates for inducing lipogenesis in ruminant adipose tissue was proposed to be glucose > propionate ≥ lactate > acetate  <cit> .

despite the well-defined greater rates of lipogenesis in subcutaneous adipose tissue of cattle  <cit> , work also has shown greater intramuscular adipose fasn activity in 16– <dig> month-old steers fed high-starch  vs. low-starch diets   <cit> . intramuscular adipose tissue from steers fed the high-starch diet incorporated more glucose than acetate into glyceride-fatty acids and this response was augmented by age  <cit> . due to gluconeogenesis in liver, both propionate and lactate can indirectly modulate adipose tissue lipogenesis through increased glucose synthesis, availability, or both. the glucogenic effect of high-starch diets is often accompanied by an enhanced insulin response  <cit> , a well-known adipogenic/lipogenic signal in rodents  <cit> . there is some indication, however, that insulin in mature cattle is not as effective in increasing in vivo rates of lipogenesis in subcutaneous adipose as it is in rodents  <cit> . the responsiveness to insulin and abundance of insulin receptors increases dramatically as preadipocytes undergo terminal differentiation into adipocytes  <cit> .

all steers in our study consumed increasing amounts of feed as the study progressed , a response associated with increasing concentrations of plasma hydroxybutyrate , glucose, and insulin between days  <dig> and  <dig> . despite the greater energy content  in the high-starch  vs. low-starch  diet, calculated energy intake did not differ significantly during the study . however, it was evident that the greater feed intake by angus × simmental  steers fed los led to numerically greater amounts of energy consumption partly explaining greater blood glucose and insulin on day  <dig> . in general, the high-starch diet was most efficacious in terms of growth and performance during the first  <dig> days of the study regardless of steer type . in addition, the high-starch diet resulted in numerically-greater feed efficiency and lower residual feed intake during the feeding period. marbling score on day  <dig> was greater in angus steers but was not affected by diet. previous early-weaned studies with a × s steers showed that feeding high-starch diets containing ca. 35% to 60% more net energy for gain  than low-starch diets resulted in greater body weight, daily rates of gain, and greater feed efficiency despite similar rates of feed intake  <cit> . it is not surprising in our study that the overall diet effect  was non-significant on most performance measures because neg intake due to his and los did not differ .

performance responses, including feed intake, energy intake, and residual feed intake from the subset of steers used for transcript profiling was comparable to the whole group of animals in the entire experiment  suggesting that the steers randomly chosen for transcript profiling were representative of the entire group. furthermore, each steer served as its own control because of the repeated sampling over time. similar approaches for transcript profiling studies of skeletal muscle tissue have been used previously  <cit> .

previously, high-starch vs. low-starch diets fed to early-weaned a × s steers  for  <dig> days resulted in moderately greater intramuscular fat  measured via ultrasound  <cit> . our steers fed los, however, consumed greater overall amounts of energy than those fed los in the study of schoonmaker et al.  <cit> . we were unable to obtain reliable measurements of marbling at  <dig> days of feeding but mrna expression data discussed in the subsequent sections is indicative of diet effects on adipogenesis and lipid filling. because the vast majority of metabolic enzymes in mammals are regulated at the transcriptional level  <cit> , measurement of mrna for multiple genes and their networks in a pathway should expand our understanding of muscle and fat development  <cit>  in response to nutrition, genotype, and their interaction  <cit> .

transcriptional regulatory networks of adipogenesis in ll
several growth factors in blood such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor- <dig> , growth hormone, thyroid hormones , as well as vitamins  <cit> , are required to stimulate proliferation of pre-adipocytes  <cit> . classical studies in cattle demonstrated subcutaneous adipocyte hyperplasia between  <dig> and  <dig> months of age  <cit> , and between  <dig> and  <dig> months of age  <cit> . there also are well-defined age-related increases in subcutaneous adipose acly, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase , acaca, and fasn activity in growing crossbred steers fed high-starch vs. low-starch diets, which correlated with in vitro lactate and acetate incorporation into lipid  <cit> . during rapid post-weaning growth it is possible that a population of pre-adipocytes exits the proliferative phase and enters terminal differentiation  <cit> .

pparg networks
pparg role in marbling deposition could be crucial because in non-ruminants most pro-adipogenic factors seem to function at least in part by activating pparγ expression or activity  <cit> . up-regulation of pparγ is sufficient to induce adipocyte differentiation in vitro and no factor has been discovered that promotes adipogenesis in the absence of pparγ  <cit> . terminal differentiation of adipocytes requires up-regulation of mrna of fatty acid binding protein  <dig> , g6pd, fasn, and acaca, among others, which are under the control of pparγ  <cit> . additional pparg-target genes  <cit>  analyzed in the present study included: acly, cd <dig> molecule  , diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase homolog  <dig> and  <dig> , stearoyl-coa desaturase , mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase , insulin induced gene  <dig> , insulin receptor , insulin receptor substrate  <dig> , solute carrier family  <dig>  member  <dig> , solute carrier family  <dig>  member  <dig> , and sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor  <dig> .

recent in vitro studies showed that bovine perimuscular pre-adipocytes induced to differentiate with insulin and glucocorticoids had greater mrna expression of pparg, srebf <dig>  fabp <dig>  acyl-coa synthetase long-chain family member  <dig> , and fasn after  <dig> days in culture compared with control  <cit> . further, pparg and fabp <dig> expression remained elevated through  <dig> days in culture, suggesting both were essential to sustain the differentiation program or that they are abundantly expressed in mature adipocytes  <cit> . in our study, overall expression of pparg mrna increased ca. 2-fold by day  <dig> primarily due to the large increase in a × s steers fed his. expression of several of its potential target genes  increased to a much greater extent . similar responses were observed recently in high-marbling wagyu × hereford vs. low-marbling piedmontese × hereford heifers at  <dig> months of age relative to  <dig> months of age  <cit> .

among all potential pparγ target genes, we found a highly-positive and significant correlation between fabp <dig> and pparg regardless of steer type or diet  which is suggestive of an increase in pparγ activity. we recently presented direct evidence, via use of the pparγ agonist rosiglitazone, that srebf <dig>  fasn, acaca and potentially fabp <dig> and thyroid hormone responsive   are pparg target genes in the bovine  <cit> . some of the above genes remained elevated through day  <dig> regardless of diet or steer type. along with pparg, the expression patterns of fasn, fabp <dig>  scd, acly, thrsp, and dgat <dig> clustered together into the most up-regulated group of genes . this observation together with the correlation data  for fasn, scd, acly, and dgat <dig> with pparg, in particular, provides additional evidence that they likely are pparg downstream genes in cattle. considering the essential role of pparγ in adipogenesis  <cit> , we speculate that these genes could be considered an essential subset for adipocyte differentiation and lipid filling. previous work showed intramuscular adipocyte hyperplasia  occurring at  <dig> through  <dig> months of age  <cit> . increased adipocyte number in our study encompassing steers ca. 4– <dig> months of age is supported by some of the measured genes which are highly abundant in adipose compared with other tissues in mammals , and also by the increase in total fatty acid concentration in muscle tissue over time .

we observed interaction effects  on the mrna expression patterns of fabp <dig>  acly, fasn, scd, gpam, and dgat <dig>  hierarchical clustering analysis clearly highlighted differences in expression of these genes across steer type and diet combinations . all these genes had the opposite response between steer types when fed the two diets particularly on day  <dig>  e.g., feeding his to a × s steers resulted in the greatest response compared with a × s steers fed los. also, angus steers responded with greater values for most of these genes when los was fed . there was a clear time effect on all the lipogenic genes  with peak expression at  <dig> days and a moderate decrease thereafter. at  <dig> days, few of these genes had significant differences between groups, with an overall tendency for angus steers to have greater values. in general, these data agree with marbling scores measured at  <dig> days showing greater responses in angus steers.

the common trend for decreased mrna expression after  <dig> days seems to suggest that the initial adipogenic response through  <dig> days did not influence intramuscular fat deposition by  <dig> days. there is evidence of positive correlations between mrna expression of certain lipogenic genes/transcription regulators and intramuscular fat content in crossbred cattle  <cit> . however, it was intriguing that a × s steers fed his, with numerically lower marbling score at day  <dig>  had the same pattern of expression among all adipogenic genes compared with angus steers fed los, which in the end had numerically greater marbling scores. it also is noteworthy that a × s steers fed los had lower temporal expression of most genes driving adipogenesis  without discernable effects on marbling scores. potential carry-over effects of high-starch diets on intramuscular fat content need to be evaluated during the finishing phase and/or at slaughter.

srebf <dig> networks
srebp <dig> is a pro-adipogenic factor regulating transcriptional cascades primarily in rodent liver  <cit> . the transcription factor binds specific dna domains  <cit>  eliciting transcription of genes involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism. a direct crosstalk with pparγ or via generation of a lipid pparγ-ligand whose identity is still unknown has been proposed as an additional mechanism during adipocyte differentiation  <cit> . we have evidence that srebf <dig> is a pparγ-target gene in bovine cells  <cit> . the role of srebp1c on lipid homeostasis in rodent cells/tissues  has been well-established  <cit> . at normal levels of expression in murine liver, srebp1c activates expression of acly, g6pd, acaca, fasn, scd, and gpam leading to synthesis of palmitic acid, oleic acid, and formation of triacylglycerol   <cit> . similar responses have been reported in murine adipose tissue  <cit> . recent data, however, casts some doubt on the essentiality of srebp <dig> for regulation of rodent adipocyte lipogenic gene expression  <cit> .

in our study, mrna of srebf <dig> was significantly greater between  <dig> and  <dig> days in all groups except a × s steers fed his . mrna of insig <dig> had greater up-regulation by  <dig> days and remained elevated through  <dig> days in all groups except a × s steers fed his. the overall increase in expression of srebf <dig>  at least through the second portion of the feeding phase, is additional indication of an enrichment  <cit>  of intramuscular adipocytes. induction of adipogenesis in bovine bone marrow stromal cells led to greater srebf <dig> mrna several days after they were induced to differentiate  <cit> . it could be possible that changes in srebf <dig> expression exert some level of control over intramuscular lipogenesis in growing cattle, but the substantial and sustained increase in expression of insig <dig> along with its high mrna abundance relative to srebf <dig>  are indicative of low activity of srebp <dig>  furthermore, a recent study in rodents found that lipogenic gene expression in adipose tissue was independent of srebp <dig>  <cit> . together, these observations cast doubt on the essentiality of this transcription factor in cattle intramuscular fat accumulation.

insig <dig> mrna in murine adipose tissue is induced by activation of pparγ but it occurs relatively late in the adipogenic program, preceded by peak of pparg and srebf <dig> mrna expression  <cit> . in fact, both pparg and srebf <dig> activate transcription of insig <dig> and regulate its expression during adipogenesis  <cit> . the primary function of insig <dig> in adipose tissue or liver is to block processing of srebp <dig>  <cit> . however, it is believed that concomitant increase in the activation of insig <dig> and srebp <dig> is a counterbalance mechanism  to prevent uncontrolled srebp <dig> action, i.e. lipogenesis  <cit> . up-regulation of insig <dig> transcription in adipocytes effectively down-regulated expression of pparg and srebf <dig>  essentially blocking differentiation of pre-adipocytes  <cit> . thus, an increase in expression of insig <dig> provides a feedback signaling mechanism to restrict both lipogenesis and adipogenesis. our data, however, do not seem to support such a mechanism in bovine muscle because the response in insig <dig> expression was greater in angus steers, which had greater marbling scores at  <dig> days. in addition, angus steers fed los had the greatest increase in expression of insig <dig> as well as numerically highest marbling scores and total fatty acids in muscle tissue . insig <dig> is a pparγ target gene in the mouse  <cit>  and previous data from our laboratory provided evidence of the same in the bovine  <cit> . these findings point to a crucial role for pparγ in controlling intramuscular lipogenesis in cattle. the pattern of insig <dig> expression together with its apparent regulation via pparγ suggest that this gene might be a pro-lipogenic rather than anti-lipogenic factor as inferred in the mouse  <cit> .

thrsp networks
thrsp is another important gene during adipocyte differentiation in rodents and is partly regulated by thyroid hormone  <cit> . in rodents, thyroid hormone exerts sustained up-regulation of thrsp expression  <cit>  and can by itself increase rates of lipogenesis in rodent adipose tissue. both insulin and thyroid hormone can act synergistically in promoting the overall process of adipogenesis in rodents  <cit> . in pigs, however, it is believed that thyroid hormone acts synergistically with other growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-i to promote adipocyte differentiation  <cit> . a microarray study previously identified thrsp, in addition to scd, fabp <dig>  and srebf <dig>  as one marker gene preferentially expressed in ll of japanese black vs. holstein steers  <cit> . the former are widely-known to possess extremely high capacity for marbling. more recently, thrsp mrna in ll was highly correlated  with intramuscular fat content in high-marbling wagyu × hereford but not in low-marbling piedmontese × hereford heifers  <cit> . both thyroid hormone and insulin are positively and significantly correlated with feed intake, body weight, and average daily gain in cattle  <cit> . insulin and high-carbohydrate diets induced thrsp mrna in rodent liver  <cit>  and adipose tissue  <cit> .

among novel results, we observed dramatic up-regulation by day  <dig> of thrsp transcription . a recent study reported marked thrsp in ll of crossbred wagyu × hereford vs. piedmontese × hereford heifers but at  <dig> to  <dig> months of age relative to  <dig> months of age  <cit> . the former had greater  carcass intramuscular fat at slaughter. in our study, the increase in thrsp was not affected by dietary starch in angus steers while in a × s steers fed his it resulted in a tremendous up-regulation of its mrna abundance. as observed for classical adipogenic genes, a × s steers fed los had greater thrsp expression by  <dig> days but the magnitude of increase was lower compared with other groups. by  <dig> days, thrsp expression was only numerically greater compared to the pre-experimental value. in other groups, mrna abundance of thrsp was maintained at >15-fold through day  <dig> compared with day  <dig>  insulin and thyroid hormone act synergistically to enhance thrsp-driven lipogenesis in rodent adipose, a mechanism that seems to be in line with the well-defined parallel increases in blood insulin and thyroid hormone during rapid growth in cattle  <cit> . we found positive correlations between both insulin and glucose with thrsp expression but only in angus cattle regardless of diet . for the most part, correlations between mrna abundance of thrsp and expression of lipogenic genes and pparg were positive and significant regardless of diet or steer type . more detailed studies will have to be conducted in the future to determine the role, if any, of thyroid hormone alone or in combination with other hormones or growth factors in the process of adipogenesis during rapid cattle growth.

despite the well-defined effect of thyroid hormone on rodent lipogenesis it also down-regulates srebf <dig> mrna expression, both in mouse liver  <cit>  and human adipose tissue  <cit> . this effect might partly explain the contrasting expression patterns of srebf <dig> and thrsp in a × s steers . sustained up-regulation in expression of thrsp in ll of growing cattle would partly overcome the need for srebf <dig> expression and activation of lipogenesis because acaca and thrsp, at least in murine liver, are co-expressed  <cit>  thus, thrsp regulation of acaca in muscle cannot be discounted.

insulin signaling in ll inferred by gene expression, blood metabolites, and insulin
short-term in vitro studies with bovine myogenic cells have demonstrated greater insr and irs <dig> protein, marked phosphorylation of irs <dig>  as well as greater protein of downstream effectors  within minutes of insulin stimulation  <cit> . insulin effectively stimulates muscle glucose oxidation and adipogenesis  <cit> , partly through up-regulation of irs <dig> transcription  <cit>  and through activation of downstream signaling cascades including transcription factors , nuclear receptors , and their gene targets .

among insr and irs <dig>  only the latter had an overall temporal increase in expression, with a pattern similar in all groups except angus steers fed los, which had a decrease in expression throughout the study . the greater temporal expression pattern of slc2a4was significant only for a × s steers fed los. both, irs <dig>  and slc2a <dig>  were among the most abundant genes measured in our experiment, suggesting an important role in ll. among isoforms of irs, expression of irs <dig> appears essential for the induction of adipogenesis mediated by insulin in rodents  <cit> . the pattern of expression of irs <dig> in our experiment does not support such a role for this gene in cattle ll. angus steers fed los, which at  <dig> days had numerically greater marbling score  and total fatty acids in muscle tissue , had the lowest increase in expression of irs <dig> and lowest plasma insulin. the low insulin together with low glucose in los-fed angus indicates that they were more insulin sensitive. the opposite was observed for a × s steers fed los, which had the lowest numerical marbling score  and lowest increase in expression of lipogenic genes despite having the largest increase in expression of irs <dig>  these results seem to cast doubt on an essential role of irs <dig> in adipogenesis/lipogenesis.

the importance of adipose pparγ to maintain systemic  insulin sensitivity in non-ruminants has been convincingly demonstrated  <cit> . blood insulin and glucose were clearly greater in a × s steers fed los, particularly during the second half of the growing phase , which could be taken as an indication of reduced insulin sensitivity. these cattle were unique because they consumed the greatest amounts of dry matter and energy but their growth and feed conversion efficiency rates did not differ substantially from other animals . clustering analysis of gene expression patterns underscored the marked differences in mrna expression induced by feeding a low-starch diet to these animals . insulin resistance in a × s steers fed los also is supported by the lower temporal response of pparg-target genes  pointing to lower activity of pparγ, which could be caused by reduced insulin signaling.

the above data are intriguing and, to some extent, counterintuitive. low-starch diets should not reduce insulin sensitivity as suggested by data from angus steers in which feeding los led to lower plasma insulin. however, results with a × s steers fed los agree with a previous study showing that intramuscular fat tissue from steers fed a low- vs. high-starch diet was less sensitive to insulin-stimulated glucose use for lipogenesis  <cit> . an insulin-resistant state in a × s steers fed los can partly help explain the lack of response in expression of adipogenic genes acaca, fasn, fabp <dig>  gpam, and dgat <dig> throughout the study  despite greater overall fold-change in srebf <dig> mrna at  <dig> days . transcriptional regulation of srebf <dig> in most non-ruminant models is sensitive to insulin, which under times of carbohydrate excess leads to stimulation of fatty acid synthesis and tag deposition both in adipose  <cit>  and liver  <cit> . the decrease in insulin sensitivity also may explain the lower expression of thrsp in a × s steers fed los, because insulin is essential for its full expression  <cit> . overall, our data suggest that low-starch diets induced insulin resistance in ll of a × s steers and highlights a difference in response to diet between pure bred and crossbred cattle. further research with greater number of cattle seems warranted to examine more directly insulin sensitivity in ll under these or similar nutritional management schemes.

intracellular ll tissue energy metabolism
nuclear receptors and co-activators involved in energy metabolism
during rapid muscle growth the energetic costs associated with protein deposition and intramuscular lipogenesis in ll tissue are expected to increase, as shown by enzymatic activity measurements over time  <cit> . ppard is a poorly-studied nuclear receptor with a potentially important role in skeletal muscle energy metabolism. ppard mrna is several fold more abundant than pparα in murine skeletal muscle and effectively performs the same function, i.e. activation of fatty acid oxidation  <cit> . the co-activators peroxisome proliferator activated receptor coactivator-1α  and -1β  also are involved in stimulating oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle  <cit> . only angus steers fed los had a significant increase in transcript abundance of ppard . ppargc1a was characterized by a blunted temporal response in all groups except angus steers fed his, which had a large increase by  <dig> days . ppargc1b was consistently up-regulated in steers fed his . we found a positive correlation  between both ppargc1a and ppargc1b with acsl <dig>  encoding a protein showing to channel fatty acids towards oxidation in heart muscle tissue  <cit> . acsl <dig> had a significant increase in expression over time in all groups except angus steers fed los .

the role of acsl <dig> in fatty acid oxidation is likely confounded in our study because in adipose tissue this protein channels fatty acids toward synthesis of tag, while in muscle it channels fatty acid toward oxidation  <cit> . the core biopsy tissue in our experiment contained both adipocytes and muscle cells. however, the blunted response in expression of this gene in angus fed los, with greater marbling score, are suggestive of a more prominent role for acsl <dig> in channeling fatty acids toward oxidation in cattle muscle cells. this is supported by the positive correlation between acsl <dig> with ppargc isoforms  <cit> .

activation of ppard in vitro has been associated with increased fatty acid oxidation through an ampk-dependent mechanism  <cit> . ampk is a heterodymeric enzyme that functions as an intracellular "fuel gauge" that monitors changes in energy status, and it is activated upon an increase in amp/atp ratio essentially reducing anabolic pathways such as lipogenesis  <cit> . the catalytic subunits of ampk are encoded by protein kinase, amp-activated, alpha  <dig> and  <dig> catalytic subunits . these two genes did not respond to dietary starch . interestingly, prkaa <dig> expression within each steer type had the opposite pattern compared with ppard. furthermore, prkaa <dig> expression during the study increased only in a × s steers but not in angus.

angus steers fed los had a greater increase in expression of ppard and numerically greater increase in expression of prkaa <dig> compared with feeding his . this might suggest that feeding los resulted in greater utilization of preformed fatty acids for oxidation through greater expression of prkaa <dig>  increasing fatty acid oxidation would be a means to spare glucose for de novo fatty acid synthesis in intramuscular adipose tissue. this suggestion is supported by the temporal expression of acly in angus steers fed los. in fact, this group had greater increase in expression of fasn by  <dig> days and greater concentrations of short-chain fatty acids in ll tissue . this mechanism in angus steers fed los is supported only by ppard data, while remaining genes potentially involved in fatty acid oxidation  seem to indicate lower oxidation of fatty acids. a factor that confounds interpretation, as indicated above, is the different composition of cells  in the core biopsy tissue. greater expression of acsl <dig> is sometimes associated with insulin resistance due to direct effects of long-chain fatty acyl-coa  <cit> . an increase in the intracellular pool of long-chain fatty acyl-coa in a × s steers fed los is supported by the sustained up-regulation in cd <dig>  and up-regulation of slc27a <dig> by day  <dig>  both proteins are involved in uptake of preformed long-chain fatty acids  <cit> .

intracellular energy sensors and insulin action
a hallmark of normal tissue insulin signaling is the enhanced uptake of long-chain fatty acids through both passive diffusion as well as protein-mediated transport  <cit> . the fatty acid translocase fat/cd <dig> plays a major role in this process  <cit> . both, contraction and insulin appear to up-regulate muscle cd <dig> recruitment from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane at least in part through the action of ampk  <cit> . longitudinal mrna expression and mrna abundance of cd <dig> and prkaa <dig> were greater in a × s steers regardless of diet, and essentially followed the opposite pattern relative to angus steers . both genes exhibited the clearest effect of steer type on transcript expression among the  <dig> genes examined and their expression clustered together . studies have shown that null mutation of cd <dig> in mouse skeletal muscle leads to impaired ampk-stimulated  fatty acid oxidation in oxidative fibers  <cit> . those previous results would imply that lower cd <dig> and prkaa <dig> mrna expression in angus steers potentially serves as a mechanism to divert more long-chain fatty acids taken up via slc27a <dig>  towards tag synthesis.

it could be possible that cd <dig> and prkaa <dig> work in concert with lpin isoforms or as yet unidentified nuclear receptors to regulate cellular fatty acid oxidation  <cit> . the lipin  <dig> isoform  was shown to selectively activate a subset of ppargc1a-target pathways, including fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in murine liver  <cit> . in our data, lpin <dig> expression was positively correlated with insulin in both angus and a × s steers fed his, suggesting that it might be associated with adipogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
results involving gene markers of mature adipocytes  provided evidence of intramuscular adipose tissue differentiation during the early portion of the growing phase. although ultrasound evaluation of intramuscular fat did not detect differences due to diet at the end of the study, gene expression patterns suggest that dietary starch level might alter pathways associated with intramuscular adipose tissue development. this was most evident in a × s steers fed high-starch vs. low-starch, which suggests that cattle genetics also might be an important factor to consider when developing management strategies to manipulate skeletal muscle composition. the resulting gene networks  underscored a central role for pparg in controlling transcription of genes which are known to coordinately regulate adipocyte differentiation and lipid filling in non-ruminants partly via insulin. analysis also highlighted a putative role of ppard, in coordination with ppargc1a and ppargc1b, in controlling intracellular energy metabolism. unlike non-ruminants, insig <dig> rather than srebf <dig> appears to play a more important role in cattle muscle adipogenesis. we propose that a network of transcription regulators and nuclear receptors including pparg-target genes, insig <dig>  and thrsp, coordinate activation of adipocyte differentiation and lipid synthesis.

more functional studies are clearly needed to determine whether up-regulation in expression of transcription factors and nuclear receptors via diet at an early age can induce precocious adipocyte differentiation and ultimately determine intramuscular fat deposition in the carcass. there will be a need for dissecting intramuscular adipose and muscle tissue so that cell-specific analysis can be made. other limitations of the study were the lack of additional functional data , and actual carcass data. despite those limitations, our data provided novel insights into longissimus lumborum energy sensing and lipogenic gene networks as affected by dietary starch level and genotype.
