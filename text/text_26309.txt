BACKGROUND
the small intestine is the primary site for digestion and selective absorption of nutrients and other food constituents. absorption of these molecules across the intestinal epithelium is mediated mainly by multiple transmembrane transporters that principally belong to two superfamilies, namely the solute carrier  and the atp binding cassette  superfamily of transporters. slc transporters located at the apical membrane of enterocytes are responsible for the selective uptake of macronutrients, such as di- and tripeptides, hexoses and fatty acids  <cit> . in contrast, abc transporters are efflux transporters responsible for the active removal of substances, including nutrients such as cholesterol, regulating their intracellular concentrations  <cit> . besides their presence in plasma membranes, slc and abc transporters are also located in intracellular organelles, such as mitochondria or peroxisomes, thus regulating intracellular and transcellular solute transport.

in addition, it has become clear that the small intestine is an important metabolic active organ, to a great extend responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nutrients and xenobiotics  <cit> . numerous metabolic reactions occur in enterocytes, including those typically referred to as phase i and phase ii metabolism. phase i metabolism includes oxidative, peroxidative, and reductive metabolism of endogenous compounds and drugs, mediated by cytochrome p <dig> isoenzymes   <cit> . phase ii metabolism often succeeds phase i metabolism and yields mainly more hydrophilic metabolites, mostly by conjugation, thereby increasing the water solubility of lipophilic compounds. the most important phase ii enzymes are sulfotransferases   <cit> , udp-glucuronosyltransferases   <cit> , glutathione s-transferases   <cit> , n-acetyltransferases   <cit> , and epoxide hydrolases   <cit> . several abc transporters are responsible for the excretion of metabolites resulting from phase i and phase ii enzymatic transformations  <cit> .

there is increasing interest in the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial or adverse effects of foods and food components. nutrients impact gene expression mainly by activating or suppressing specific transcription factors  <cit> . the most important group of transcription factors involved in mediating the effect of nutrients and their metabolites on gene transcription is the superfamily of nuclear receptors, which consists of  <dig> members in the human genome  <cit> . this superfamily is subdivided into six families  <cit> , of which the nr <dig> family is most relevant to nutrition. one important group of receptors that mediates the effects of dietary fatty acids and its derivatives on gene expression are the peroxisome proliferator activated receptors   <cit> . three ppar isotypes, α , δ  , and γ  are distinguished and characterized by different biological roles. transcriptional regulation by ppars requires heterodimerization with the retinoid x receptor   <cit> . when activated by an agonist, the ppar/rxr heterodimer stimulates transcription via binding to dna response elements  present in and around the promoter of target genes. besides upregulating gene expression, ppars are also able to repress transcription by directly interacting with other transcription factors and interfere with their signaling pathways, a mechanism commonly referred to as transrepression  <cit> .

pparα has been shown to be expressed at a high level in the small intestine  <cit> . moreover, the average western diet contains a high amount of triacylglycerols  <cit>  that are hydrolyzed to monoacylglycerol and free fatty acids before entering the enterocyte  <cit> . as a result the small intestine is frequently exposed to high levels of natural pparα agonists. however, currently little is known about the effects of pparα activation by dietary fats on gene expression in small intestine. although in several studies small intestinal gene expression was studied after high-fat feeding  <cit> , the specific role of pparα remains to be elucidated.

here, we take advantage of a unique experimental design using triglycerides composed of identical fatty acids in combination with gene expression profiling to examine the effects of individual dietary fatty acids on intestinal gene expression in mice. by conducting these experiments in wild-type and pparα -/- mice, and by limiting the exposure time to  <dig> hours, we were able to elucidate the specific, direct contribution of pparα in regulating the expression of transport and phase i/ii metabolism genes in small intestine.

RESULTS
effect of acute pparα activation with oa, epa, dha and wy14643
in this study we investigated the role of pparα on the expression of genes encoding for transport proteins and phase i/ii metabolic enzymes, collectively called barrier proteins, which are responsible for the selective absorption and metabolism of food components. since we are specifically interested in the role pparα plays in nutrient-mediated gene regulation, we used and compared in our studies  <dig> natural agonists normally found in the diet . as reference we used the synthetic agonist wy <dig>  we analyzed gene expression  <dig> hours after oral gavage, thus we primarily studied the direct effects of pparα activation. this time point was chosen because in a pilot experiment we found that after an oral fat load plasma triacylglycerol levels peaked at 2– <dig> hours post loading and almost returned to basal levels after  <dig> hours , indicating that at that point most of the fat bolus has passed through the enterocytes, and sufficient time remained for transcriptional events to occur. expression of transport and phase i/ii metabolism genes  was studied using microarrays. the affymetrix genechip mouse genome  <dig>  <dig>  array comprised of  <dig>  probesets, representing  <dig>  unique genes. annotation information from affymetrix was queried to compile a list of transport and phase i/ii metabolism genes present on the array . this set consisted of  <dig> probesets, encoding for  <dig> unique genes, and was used throughout all analyses. we identified  <dig>  significantly expressed genes in small intestine, of which  <dig> were barrier genes.

as expected, of all agonists used in this study, acute treatment with wy <dig> provoked the most pronounced response, both with respect to the number of regulated genes and the magnitude of the fold changes. treatment with wy <dig> resulted in the pparα-specific differential expression of  <dig> transport and phase i/ii metabolism genes , of which  <dig> were expressed at higher levels and  <dig> genes were reduced in wild-type mice compared to pparα-null mice . on the other hand, treatment of wild-type and pparα-null mice with oa identified only  <dig> pparα-dependently regulated barrier genes . of these,  <dig> were induced and  <dig> repressed . treatment with epa and dha resulted in  <dig> and  <dig> pparα-dependently regulated barrier genes, respectively . activation of pparα by epa increased the expression of  <dig> genes and suppressed  <dig> genes , whereas for dha these numbers were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively .

number of pparα-dependently regulated genes and corresponding percentages for all genes and the barrier gene set after activation with oa, epa, dha, and wy <dig>  the percentages relate to the total number of expressed genes  and all barrier genes , respectively.

in bünger et al  <cit>  we reported that under basal  conditions only  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in small intestine of wild-type mice compared to pparα-null mice. the currently investigated barrier gene set includes  <dig> of these genes, slc25a <dig> and cyp4a <dig>  which were both expressed at lower levels in the null mice. we found that expression of slc25a <dig> was only slightly elevated after acute treatment with wy <dig>  epa, and dha, which indicates that the regulation of slc25a <dig> by pparα may be of less relevance during  activation of pparα. in contrast, the fold induction of cyp4a <dig> observed after acute treatment with wy <dig>  epa and dha was much larger than the basal difference, which implies that for this gene activation of pparα is of importance.

when comparing the list of barrier genes that were pparα-dependently regulated after acute treatment with wy <dig> with that of a long-term  exposure experiment  <cit> , we found an overlap of 74% . this indicates that short-term regulation evoked with synthetic agonists is maintained for at least  <dig> days.

hirai et al  <cit>  very recently reported their study in which they identified seven nutrient and drug transporters that were pparα-dependently regulated in small intestine after  <dig> days exposure to two synthetic agonists. in concordance with their data, we found that all except  <dig> of these transporters were regulated after acute treatment with wy <dig> as well. in addition, we observed that these carriers were also pparα-dependently regulated by dha and epa. like hirai et al, we did not observe a pparα-dependent regulation of pept <dig> , the first intestinal nutrient transporter shown to be pparα-dependently regulated during fasting  <cit> .

to characterize the importance of pparα in controlling expression of small intestinal transporters and phase i/ii metabolic enzymes, we compared the fraction of pparα-dependently regulated genes of the barrier gene set with that observed for all genes . for treatment with oa the percentages were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, for the set of barrier genes and all expressed genes. this difference was not statistically significant . however, the other two natural agonists showed a significantly higher percentage of regulated genes for the barrier gene set than for all genes; for epa this percentage was  <dig> % for all genes, whereas  <dig> % of the barrier genes were regulated . for dha these percentages were  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively . for wy <dig> we observed an even larger difference between all genes and the barrier gene set;  <dig> % respectively  <dig> % of the genes were regulated in a pparα-dependent manner . these results imply that pparα plays an important role in regulating small intestinal gene expression of transporter and phase i/ii metabolic enzymes.

overlap between oa, epa, dha and wy <dig> treatment
we also determined the overlap of pparα-dependently regulated genes between the different treatments. most of the genes regulated upon treatment with oa were not regulated by dha and epa  or wy <dig> . only four genes, i.e. slc27a <dig> , cyp4f <dig>  cyp2c <dig>  and abcd <dig> were regulated upon all  <dig> treatments. for these genes additional qrt-pcr analyses were performed, which confirmed the array results . there was considerable overlap between the genes affected by epa, dha or wy <dig> treatment . these overlapping genes behaved the same in all treatments, i.e. they were either increased or suppressed in wild-type compared to pparα-null mice upon all treatments. in table  <dig> of the additional data the complete list of overlapping genes is presented. it is likely that oa treatment affected fewer genes, because the mice may be adapted to this fatty acid since they were fed a diet based on olive oil three weeks before gavage . in addition, it is generally accepted that polyunsaturated fatty acids activate pparα better than monounsaturated fatty acids  <cit> , which is in line with our result that oa activated less genes pparα-dependently than epa and dha. although the overlap between wy14643-, epa-, and dha-regulated genes was high, we still observed differential gene activation between these treatments. the exact mechanism underlying these differences are currently unclear, but we speculate this may be partially due to the differential recruitment of coactivators such as src- <dig>  med <dig>  pgc1α, and p <dig> by the three agonists  <cit> . alternatively, hitherto unknown additional signaling routes not shared by the three agonists may exist.

microarray results were confirmed with qpcr. fc = fold change, ma = microarray, qpcr = quantitative pcr. for the qpcr analysis: mrna levels were standardized to cyclophilin; expression in the pparα-null mice was arbitrarily set to  <dig>  significance was determined by a bayesian t-test  or unpaired student's t-test , * = p-value < <dig> . data are means ± standard error .

functional implications of acute pparα activation in small intestine
a summary of functional outcomes of pparα activation by the agonists inferred from our data is presented in table  <dig>  although in this study we only determined mrna levels, it has been reported that for the majority of genes the mrna levels reflect protein abundance very well  <cit> . we therefore allow ourselves to speculate about the functional consequences of nutritional pparα activation. nevertheless, these implications should ultimately be evaluated in follow-up studies.

overview of pparα-dependently regulated processes related to transport and phase i/ii metabolism in the small intestine. all processes are described in the results and discussion section. fc = fold change, nc = not changed.

role of pparα in intestinal fatty acid oxidation
it is well established that pparα serves as a master regulator of fatty acid catabolism, which is also apparent from our data  <cit> . various transporters and phase i enzymes involved in fatty acid uptake and oxidation were pparα-dependently regulated . although the extent varied somewhat, all  <dig> agonists regulated long chain fatty acid uptake, mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation, ω-oxidation, and the metabolism of energy-yielding substrates . for most genes this regulation was agonist-independent and is consistent with earlier findings  <cit> . it is known that enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation is correlated with reduced severity of inflammatory bowel disease  <cit> . furthermore it has been shown that wy <dig> treatment caused a reduction of colon injury in a murine dnbs experimental colitis model  <cit>  and that wy <dig> treatment might have an anti-inflammatory effect in the small intestine  <cit> . it has been reported that the expression of octn <dig> , involved in apical carnitine uptake, is induced by wy <dig> and clofibrate  <cit> . here we showed that also epa and dha induced expression of octn <dig>  recently it has been reported that two functionally relevant polymorphisms in the octn <dig>  gene are associated with increased risk for inflammatory bowel disease  <cit> , and that octn <dig> expression is decreased in rats with induced inflammatory bowel disease  <cit> . taken together, our data imply that nutritional activation of pparα might be therapeutically valuable for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

pparα regulates intestinal cholesterol flux
expression of the apical cholesterol uptake transporter npc1l <dig> was pparα-dependently suppressed after treatment with wy <dig>  epa, and dha , as also has been observed after fenofibrate treatment  <cit>  and pparδ activation  <cit> . it is known that treatment with wy <dig> for  <dig> days induced expression of abca <dig>  <cit> . here we show that abca <dig> is also acutely regulated after pparα activation. abca <dig>  which promotes cholesterol efflux at the basolateral membrane to apo-ai for hdl formation  <cit>  was increased after treatment with wy <dig> and epa. functionally these results suggest that less cholesterol is absorbed from the lumen and more cholesterol is transferred to apo-a <dig>  resulting in reduced intracellular cholesterol levels in enterocytes. enterocytes likely compensate for this by increasing the activity of hmg-coa reductase, as has been reported before  <cit> .

pparα regulates intestinal nutrient transport and metabolism
expression of the apical glucose uptake transporter sglt <dig>  and the basolateral glucose efflux transporter glut <dig>  was pparα-dependently repressed after wy <dig> treatment. furthermore, wy <dig>  epa, and dha all reduced expression of the apical mannose and glucose uptake transporter sglt <dig> , suggesting that pparα activation results in reduced glucose transport through the intestinal wall. in addition, several transporters involved in the amino acid metabolism were pparα-dependently regulated . gene expression of small intestinal apical uptake as well as basolateral efflux amino acid transporters was pparα-dependently suppressed. furthermore, activation of pparα reduced expression of slc25a <dig> , which is involved in the malate-aspartate shuttle  <cit> . these effects are in line with data that showed pparα-mediated downregulation of genes involved in hepatic amino acid metabolism  <cit> . for liver it is suggested that amino acids are conserved for local synthetic processes, including protein and purine synthesis during for instance proliferation  <cit> . in the small intestine villus length is increased after wy <dig> treatment  <cit> , which implies that also in the small intestine amino acids are conserved for local anabolic processes. taken together, our results suggest that pparα activation leads to a diminished  amino acid flux through the enterocyte.

pparα regulates intestinal motility
expression of the serotonin transporter slc6a <dig>  was decreased after treatment with wy <dig>  epa, and dha . serotonin is a neurotransmitter secreted by enterochromaffin cells and is considered to play a key role in functioning of the gut, initiating peristaltic reflex pathways and facilitating propulsive activity  <cit> .

inactivation of serotonin is crucial to limit its activity, and this is mediated by sert  <cit> . the observed reduced expression will result in a diminished activity of sert, which in turn may increase intestinal motility  <cit> . serotonin is detoxified by sulfation inside the enterocyte  <cit> . the apical sulfate import seems to be reduced as gene expression of the uptake transporter slc13a <dig>  was decreased. this might be a response to the decreased uptake of serotonin. we also showed that the dopamine transporter dat <dig> was pparα-dependently upregulated after epa and oa treatment . dopamine increases contractile force of intestinal motility  <cit> , thus more dopamine likely results in increased intestinal motility. altogether, we believe it is likely that pparα is involved in regulating intestinal motility. our data suggest that in feeding conditions pparα activation may result in speeding-up intestinal motility.

pparα diminishes effects of oxidative stress
oxidative stress results from an imbalance between formation and degradation of pro-oxidants or decreased cellular antioxidant protection mechanisms and may result in increased cell damage and apoptosis  <cit> . many genes included in our barrier gene set, such as cypp450s, gsts, and several slc transporters, are involved in oxidative stress and were pparα-dependently regulated. cypp450s induce oxidative stress by oxidative, peroxidative, and reductive metabolism of endogenous compounds and drugs  <cit> , whereas gsts are involved in the defense against oxidative stress by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione to a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous electrophilic compounds  <cit> . various cypp <dig> genes were pparα-dependently upregulated , which is in line with data obtained from liver  <cit> . however, since not all cypp <dig> genes are expressed in both organs, the regulated genes were not identical. many gsts were upregulated by activation with wy <dig>  epa, and dha . in addition, various slc transporters involved in oxidative stress defense were pparα-dependently upregulated; dic , involved in the pyruvate-malate shuttle, citrate-pyruvate shuttle, and gluconeogenesis from pyruvate, is known to protect against oxidative stress  <cit> ; svct <dig> , a basolaterally-located uptake transporter for ascorbic acid  <cit> ; mct <dig> , proposed to play an important role in communicating information on the redox state between cells  <cit> ; abcg <dig> , a secretion transporter of heme and porphyrins located in the apical membrane  <cit> ; and kmcp <dig> , probably involved in protection from oxidative damage in situations of increased mitochondrial metabolism  <cit> . taken together, we show that many barrier genes involved in defense against oxidative stress were pparα-dependently upregulated. these data point towards an important role of pparα in the defense against oxidative stress. in general oxidative stress results in increased cell damage and apoptosis  <cit>  and our data might explain one of the mechanisms by which wy <dig> suppresses many genes involved in apoptosis in the small intestine  <cit> .

longitudinal distribution of the transcriptional regulation during pparα activation is not the same for pparα-dependently regulated genes
finally we investigated the expression along the proximal-distal axis of pparα and  <dig> genes that were pparα-dependently regulated by all agonists . expression was measured with qrt-pcr. for this analysis, the small intestine was divided in  <dig> equal parts; part  <dig> represents the proximal side, whereas part  <dig> represents the most distal end. expression of pparα was maximal in duodenum and jejunum, and then gradually declined in ileum, both under basal conditions and after acute activation with wy <dig> . for all treatments only the expression pattern in treated wild-type and pparα-null mice of the  <dig> genes is reported . fatp <dig>  abcd <dig>  cyp2c <dig>  and cyp4f <dig> are all involved in fatty acid metabolism; fatp <dig> mediates the apical uptake of long chain fatty acids  <cit> , whereas abcd <dig> is involved in the peroxisomal β-oxidation of long chain fatty acids  <cit> . the human homolog of cyp2c <dig>  metabolizes arachidonic acid and generates epoxygenase products  <cit> . the rat homolog of cyp4f <dig>  is involved in ω-oxidation of prostaglandins  <cit> .

in epa-, dha- and wy14643-treated mice we observed a similar expression pattern of fatp <dig> , which closely resembled that of pparα under control and wy14643-activated conditions. in contrast, oa-treated wild-type mice did not show this pattern. in all treatments no significant pparα-dependent induction of fatp <dig> was observed in the distal part of the small intestine. abcd <dig> was uniformly induced by all treatments . activation with wy <dig> revealed a robust, equal induction in all segments in wild-type compared to pparα-null mice, whereas these were less for the three natural agonists. cyp2c <dig> was predominantly expressed in the proximal part of the small intestine, and showed high similarity between agonists . for each agonist we observed an induction of its expression which was equal along the complete longitudinal axis. cyp4f <dig> was uniformly expressed along the proximal-distal axis in treated pparα-null mice . however, treatment of wild-type mice with wy <dig> and oa shifted the expression of cyp4f <dig> to more distal regions, whereas epa and dha treatment resulted in significant increased expression in more proximal segments.

taken together, the data in figure  <dig> show that in general all agonists provoke a similar effect on expression of  <dig> pparα-dependently regulated genes, and this induction also occurs in more distally-located cells. the latter demonstrates that despite its relatively low expression, pparα is still able to regulate gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
in the current study we have identified intestinal barrier genes that were pparα-dependently regulated after acute activation by fatty acids. the functional outcomes inferred from our data suggest that nutritional-activated pparα controls processes ranging from fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol-, glucose-, and amino acid-transport and metabolism to intestinal motility and oxidative stress. altogether, we showed that pparα has a great impact in controlling the barrier function of the gut, and this underscores the importance of pparα for nutrient-mediated gene regulation in intestine.
