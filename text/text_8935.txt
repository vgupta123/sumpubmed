BACKGROUND
micrornas  are 20– <dig> nt-long non-coding rnas transcribed predominantly by the rna polymerase ii  <cit> . mirnas play an important role in regulating gene expression at the protein and mrna levels. they have been previously shown to inhibit translation initiation and elongation and induce deadenylation and degradation of mrna . in addition, there are indications that mirnas may also activate translation  <cit> .

along with transcription factors, mirnas contribute to skeletal myogenesis . myogenic micrornas mir- <dig>  mir-133a/b and mir- <dig>  regulate myogenic differentiation and proliferation of myogenic cells by targeting important regulators of myogenesis  <cit>  . mir- <dig> and mir-133a are expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscles  <cit> , while mir-133b and mir- <dig> are expressed solely in skeletal muscles  <cit> .

most mirnas expressed in skeletal muscles are found to be upregulated during myogenesis. these include mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir-26a  <cit> , mir-27b  <cit> , mir-29b/c  <cit> , mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir-208b/ <dig>  <cit> , mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir-322/ <dig> and mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir- <dig>  <cit> . only few known mirnas are involved in the regulation of myogenic differentiation are downregulated during myogenesis. these include mir-125b  <cit>  and mir-221/ <dig>  <cit>  .

altogether, myogenesis-related mirnas have been studied during myogenic differentiation of human primary myoblasts  <cit>  and in various model systems, e.g. the immortalized murine cell line c2c <dig>  <cit> , murine primary satellite cells and myogenic progenitor cells  <cit>  as well as quail myoblasts  <cit> . several myogenesis-related mirnas have been discovered or confirmed by expression profiling of developing muscular tissues in humans  <cit> , pigs  <cit>  and in the common carp  <cit>  .

to perform transcriptome profiling of myogenic cells, it appears interesting to use primary myogenic cells cultivated in vitro rather than whole muscle tissues. this approach minimizes biases caused by the presence of inflammatory, connective tissue-derived and other non-myogenic cells. nevertheless, totally avoiding contamination by non-myogenic cells is difficult unless clonal populations of immortalized myogenic cells are used. an alternative to generating immortalized lines of myogenic cells is the utilization of primary cell population enriched for myogenic precursors. however, in previous mirna and mrna expression profiling reports, primary skeletal myoblasts cultivated in vitro have not been enriched for myogenic cells prior to analysis.

in the present study, we have thus decided to profile mirna expression in cultures of cd56+ primary myoblasts and myotubes isolated from healthy individuals using an affinity purification procedure  <cit> . a total of  <dig> mirnas were found to be differentially expressed during myogenic differentiation induced by serum starvation of which  <dig> had not been previously associated with myogenesis. in addition, we have performed microarray mrna transcriptome profiling on the same myoblasts and myotubes samples as used for mirna expression profiling in order to assign targets for these mirnas.

RESULTS
identification of new myogenesis-related mirna  in human primary myoblasts
to identify new myogenesis-related mirnas in human cells, cd56+ myogenic precursors were isolated from skeletal muscle biopsies of six healthy individuals . these were then induced to differentiate in vitro using serum starvation and the progression of myogenic differentiation was monitored by following the expression of myogenin  and other myogenic differentiation markers including id <dig>  tnnt <dig>  tnnt <dig>  myl <dig>  col15a <dig>  vim and cav <dig> . the disappearance of proliferating cells and concomitant emergence of myotubes was monitored using ki <dig> staining and microscopic observation .

we observed a statistically significant difference of the expression levels of myogenesis-related markers in proliferating or differentiated myogenic cells isolated from different healthy subjects. this difference was considered as a natural heterogeneity of gene expression levels in different subjects that might be explained by their age, sex, physical activity or diet preferences, therefore, all samples analyzed were included in the study.

the expression of  <dig> different micrornas was then profiled in human primary myoblasts and myotubes using taqman low density array  . in total,  <dig> mirnas were found to be differentially expressed during myogenic differentiation with p-values ranging from  <dig> x10- <dig> to 5x10- <dig> . these will be referred to as myogenesis-related mirnas . sequences and corresponding taqman probe codes for these micrornas can be found in the additional file  <dig> 

the majority  of mr-mirs were found to be upregulated of which  <dig> had not been previously reported as involved in the regulation of myogenesis either in humans or in other species . of the  <dig> mr-mirs that were found to be downregulated during myogenesis,  <dig> had not been previously associated with myogenic differentiation.

mrna transcriptome profiling and functional classification of differentially expressed genes
until now, mrna expression profiling of human myoblasts has been performed exclusively on primary cells  <cit> . however, primary skeletal myoblasts have not been enriched for myogenic cells prior to analysis. to avoid analyzing mixed populations of myoblasts and non-myogenic cells, we have used rna extracted from cd56+ myoblasts purified from muscular tissues. then, using agilent transcriptome 44 k microarrays, we identified  <dig>  differentially expressed genes of which  <dig>  and  <dig>  were down- or up-regulated, respectively . in most cases, a functional class could be assigned to these transcripts using the david gene ontology database   <cit> .

in agreement with previous reports, the majority of upregulated genes were found to control metabolism, myogenesis, insulin receptor signaling or to positively regulate transcription . genes involved in the control of cell cycle, dna damage response, angiogenesis, cell motility and invasion as well as protein modification and nf-kb signaling belonged to the group of genes downregulated during myogenic differentiation . genes involved in the regulation of ubiquitination/proteolysis, protein transport/localization, transcription regulation and apoptosis were found to be either up- or down-regulated . the complete list of genes found to be differentially expressed during in vitro myogenic differentiation of human primary myoblasts can be found in the additional file  <dig> 

subclasses are italicized, the cutoff value for differentially expressed genes was set to  <dig>  fold change.

predication of myogenesis-related mirna target genes
a common practice to boost target gene predictions accuracy is to use several prediction algorithms and then to combine their predictions. however, this approach has been proved inefficient  <cit> . therefore, we have used a single algorithm, e.g. rna <dig>  <cit>  to predict mirna targets. rna <dig> has been chosen for its low rate of false-positive predictions as compared to other algorithms  <cit> . for each mirna, the number of target predictions varied between  <dig> and  <dig> .

according to previous reports, the proportion of correct predictions can be as low as 10%  <cit>  , we reasoned that the expression levels of mrna and mirna should be inversely correlated if one regulates the other. indeed, for upregulated mr-mirna, the majority of their predicted target genes was found to be underexpressed. similarly, most downregulated mr-mirnas had upregulated predicted targets. indeed, for every microrna tested, the distribution of pearson correlation coefficients of its predicted target genes was shifted towards negative values. this was the case neither for randomly selected genes, nor when the sample correspondence was permuted  which was used to establish a significance threshold of pearson correlation coefficients. target genes with correlation coefficients below the threshold had less than 5% chances to be random. we call these genes “supported targets” to underscore the fact that the prediction was supported by mrna transcriptome profiling . on average, 11% of microrna target genes predicted by the rna <dig> algorithm were “supported” by mrna transcriptome profiling .

we then compared the accuracy of predictions made by rna <dig> and targetscan, another popular mirna target prediction algorithm. as an indication of accuracy, we have used a percentage of predicted targets that were supported by transcriptome data. for  <dig> of  <dig> target genes, rna <dig> demonstrated higher percentage of predictions supported by transcriptome data, for  <dig> more micrornas the difference in the accuracy of predictions was insignificant .

qrt-pcr validation of supported mirna target genes
to demonstrate the relevance of our mirna target predictions, we altered the expression of several micrornas and measured the expression of their predicted target genes, supported by the transcriptome data. to illustrate the impact of mirna repression on the expression of their target genes, we have chosen to inhibit the expression of four well-characterized myogenic micrornas mir- <dig>  -133a, -133b and - <dig> in human immortalized myoblasts using lna  antisense micrornas . human immortalized myoblasts were differentiated in vitro and then transfected separately with anti-mirs targeting mir- <dig>  mir-133a, mir-133b and mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> have the same seed sequence and, therefore, target very similar lists of genes. the same is true for mir-133a and mir-133b. we have then randomly selected  <dig> and  <dig> genes predicted to be targeted by mir-1/ <dig> and mir-133a/b respectively and supported by our transcriptome data and tested their expression using qrt-pcr in the cells transfected with corresponding anti-mirs. repressing mir-1/ <dig> resulted in the upregulation of six of its targets: ap3d <dig> , col3a <dig> , hdac <dig> , pdcd <dig> , prkab <dig>  and znf <dig> . these target genes were considered as novel “qrt-pcr validated” target genes of mir- <dig> and - <dig> . six other target genes supported by our transcriptome data including atp2b <dig>  c11orf <dig>  foxp, g2e <dig>  mboat <dig> and tubb could not be validated via qrt-pcr experimentally, as we did not observe significant changes of their expression following anti-mir transfection .

in the case of mir-133a and -133b, immortalized myotube transfection anti-mirs resulted in the upregulation of six of ten randomly selected target genes, supported by our transcriptome data. these novel qrt-pcr validated targets of mir-133a and -133b include asap <dig> , arfgap <dig> , atp1a <dig> , c7orf <dig> , rbm15b  and tmcc <dig>  . four other target genes supported by our transcriptome data including lmcd <dig>  nat <dig>  prpf38a and syngr <dig> could not be validated via qrt-pcr, as we did not observed significant changes of their expression following anti-mir transfection .

to illustrate the impact of mirna overexpression on the expression of their target genes, we have selected two micrornas, mir- <dig> and - <dig>  that were previously shown to be upregulated during myogenic differentiation  <cit> , but their function in myogenesis is not well-established. two plasmids coding for the corresponding pre-mirnas or scrambled sequence were transfected separately into human rhabdomyosarcoma cells, and the expression of their target genes was then tested via qrt-pcr. ectopic overexpression of mir- <dig> led to the downregulation of three of its four target genes, randomly selected among the genes supported by our transcriptome data. these novel qrt-pcr validated mir- <dig> target genes include edaradd , cav <dig>  and dtymk  . one transcriptome-supported mir- <dig> target gene, rbm15b, could not be validated using qrt-pcr, as we did not observed significant changes in its expression level following mirna precursor tranfection .

similarly, overexpressing mir- <dig> led to the downregulation of three of its five randomly selected transcriptome-supported targets. these qrt-pcr validated mir- <dig> targets include plxnb , c11orf <dig>  and atp2b <dig>  . two remaining mir- <dig> target genes, ppia and casd <dig> could not be validated via qrt-pcr, as we did not observed significant changes in its expression level following mirna precursor transfection .

overall, at least 50% of the supported target genes tested in this study appeared to be regulated by their corresponding microrna either directly or indirectly which is significantly better than the result of ordinary bioinformatic prediction with only 10% of correctly predicted target genes.

functional analysis of mr-mirna target genes supported by transcrptome data
after functional classification of genes differentially expressed during myogenic differentiation in vitro, we thought to determine the proportion of microrna-controlled genes within each functional class. almost 30% of all protein coding genes contain mirna seeds in their 3′utrs and are, therefore, potential mirna targets  <cit> . indeed, we have found that a significant proportion of genes differentially expressed during myogenic differentiation appeared to be controlled by micrornas. however, the proportion of genes targeted by micrornas was not the same within different functional classes. for example, 50% to 55% of genes related to angiogenesis and nf-kb signaling were potentially targeted by mirnas, while in the case of myogenesis, potential mirna targets represented only  <dig> % of genes . interestingly, more mirna targets were found among downregulated than upregulated genes. for example, among apoptosis-related genes,  <dig> % of upregulated and  <dig> % of downregulated genes were found to be targeted by mirnas . this observation prompted us to search for known functions of each supported target gene of every mr-mirna described in this study using david functional annotation tool  <cit> .

mir- <dig> and mir-206
it has been previously demonstrated that mir- <dig> and - <dig> target genes linked to the regulation of chromatin modifications  <cit> , transcription  <cit>  and cell cycle  <cit> . functional analysis of predicted mir- <dig> target genes supported by transcriptome data indicated that these micrornas might also target genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis, dna damage response, cell motility and protein modification, cell signaling and kinase activity  <cit> . our own functional analysis of predicted target genes of mir- <dig> and - <dig> supported by transcriptome analysis confirmed that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> might target genes involved in in these biological processes. in addition, mirna- <dig> and - <dig> might target genes implicated in cytoskeleton organization, ubiquitination and nucleotide biosynthesis .

mir-27a
mir-27b is involved in the regulation of transcription by inhibiting the expression of various transcription factors  <cit> . here we confirm the role of mir-27b as an important transcriptional regulator, in addition, our predictions suggest that mir-27a might be involved in the regulation of intracellular transport, apoptosis, kinase activity, protein complex assembly, cytoskeleton organization and other biological functions including dna damage response, cell cycle, motility, nucleotide biosynthesis and protein phosphorylation .

mir-30c
mir- <dig> was shown to induce apoptosis  <cit>  and regulate cell motility by influencing extracellular the matrix remodelling process  <cit> . this microrna is also known to regulate protein modification e.g. sumoylation  <cit>  and transcription  <cit> . we here confirm that mir-30c might target genes participate in the regulation of apoptosis and cell motility regulation but not transcription control. instead, our predictions suggest that mir- <dig> might target genes involved in the regulation of protein phosphorylation and kinase activity, cell cycle control, intracellular transport, cytoskeleton organization, protein ubiquitination, dna damage response and nucleotide biosynthesis .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
micrornas, particularly mir- <dig>  - <dig> and -133a/b, play crucial roles in myogenesis  <cit> . these are called myomirs to underscore their importance in myogenesis . previously, high-throughput profiling of mirna expression performed in human myoblasts have resulted in identification of mirnas differentially expressed during myogenic differentiation  <cit> . besides that, a larger number of mirnas have been found to be differentially expressed during myogenic differentiation of mouse c2c <dig> myoblasts  <cit> , mouse myogenic progenitors  <cit>  or at various stages of development of skeletal muscles in pig  <cit>  or in the common carp  <cit> .

here, we have compared mirna expression profiles in human proliferating primary cd56+ myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. sixty differentially expressed mirnas were identified . twenty of these had not been previously implicated in myogenesis. conversely, several mirnas previously reported as related to myogenic differentiation were not identified in the present study. these included mir- <dig>  <cit> , hsa-mir- <dig>   <cit> , mir-29b/c  <cit> , mir- <dig>  mir-208a  <cit> , mir-208b, mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir-125b  <cit>  . one mirna, mir- <dig>  previously shown to be upregulated in mouse myogenic precursors  <cit>  could not be tested here. the difficulties to confirm previously reported data for several mirnas associated with myogenesis in model organisms could be due to species-specific characteristics in the myogenesis program or could originate from differences in experimental conditions. indeed, high-throughput mirna expression profiling has been previously performed using mixed cell populations isolated from skeletal myoblasts  <cit> . the resulting presence of non-myogenic cells, including fibroblasts and inflammatory cells, could have altered the resulting mirna expression profiles. it thus appears that the existing repertoire of myogenic mirnas is still incomplete or contaminated with mirnas unrelated to myogenesis. for example, we have demonstrated that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were downregulated during myogenic differentiation of human myoblasts while others reported their upregulation  <cit> . our results are in agreement with previous reports demonstrating that these micrornas are downregulated during myogenesis in mice  <cit> .

in addition to microrna expression profiling, we have profiled mrna expression in myogenic cells in the course of myogenic differentiation. transcriptome analysis of myogenesis has been previously reported by others. in mice, several models have been used for transcriptome profiling. these include c2c <dig> immortalized cell line considered as the “golden standard” of in vitro myogenic differentiation  <cit> , primary mouse myoblasts  <cit>  and an in vivo model of muscle regeneration following injury  <cit> . in humans, the only published mrna expression profiling has been performed on primary cells grown in vitro <cit> . the transcriptome profiling of human myoblasts in the course of myogenic differentiation in vitro described here, has two important advantages over the previously published study. firstly, we used cd56+ myogenic cells that allowed us to exclude from the analysis genes unrelated to myogenesis. secondly, our study is the first example of a simultaneous mirna/mrna expression profiling of myogenic cells.

simultaneous mirna/mrna was used here to identify novel target genes of myogenesis-related micrornas. this approach has been proven efficient for increasing the precision of bioinformatics predictions for mirna targets  <cit> , and it has been applied previously to identify mirna target genes in neural tissue  <cit>  and cancer cell lines  <cit> , but not in myogenic cells or muscle tissue.

several methods are used to validate the target genes of mirna. these include qrt-pcr, luciferase assays and western blot . luciferase assay based on a reporter plasmid containing mirna recognition sites in the 3′ utr of the luciferase gene is the method used to demonstrate the direct inhibition of mrna expression by mirna. however this method does not provide information as to whether the mirna-dependent regulation occurs at the level of transcript stability or at the level of translation, nor the direct mirna:mrna interaction demonstrated by this method does guarantee the physiological significance of the observed mirna effect. here, to validate the predicted target genes, we have used qrt-pcr validation approach. this method is more physiological than luciferase assay as it measures the expression of target gene from their natural genomic context, although it can not discriminate between direct and indirect effects of mirna expression. hereby, we have randomly selected  <dig> genes targeted by  <dig> different micrornas including mir- <dig>  - <dig>  -133a, -133b, - <dig> and - <dig> and tested their expression using prt-pcr in the cells where corresponding microrna was ectopically overexpressed or inhibited. we have demonstrated the mirna-dependent inhibition for  <dig> of these target genes. we called these genes “qrt-pcr validated” to formally distinguish them from simply “validated”, as the latter term is usually reserved for mirna target genes validated using luciferase reporters.

on average, we estimate that the lists of predicted target genes supported by transcriptome data contain at least 50% of genes that will change their expression, according to our predictions, in response to the alterations of microrna expression.

using the lists of target genes supported by transcriptome data we have deduced functional impact of mr-mirs using david functional annotation tool  <cit> . our predictions generally corresponded to already known functions of mr-mirs demonstrated by others, but also allowed us to make suggestions about novel functions of mr-mirs. it has to be noted, that these predictions have to be handled with caution for two reasons:  according to our estimation, among target genes supported by transcriptome analysis, up to 50% might not react to mirna alteration, as predicted;  the functions of mr-mir have been deduced using bioinformatic prediction algorithms that can not substitute for a true experimental validation of microrna functions.

to summarize, we have discovered  <dig> human mirnas not previously known to be differentially expressed during myogenic differentiation and confirmed  <dig> myogenesis-related micrornas. we then used an approach that included a simultaneous mirna/mrna expression profiling to predict targets genes of these micrornas with more than 50% accuracy, although whether these are direct or indirect targets of mirna remains unknown. finally, we deduced novel functions of these microrna from the known functions of their target genes. further studies are necessary to confirm our predictions of functional contribution of newly discovered mirnas to the process of myogenic differentiation.
