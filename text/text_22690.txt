BACKGROUND
the accurate identification of t-cell epitopes remains a critical step in the development of subunit and peptide-based vaccines  <cit> . the first step of such studies is usually in silico prediction of potential mhc binders from the sequence of a studied protein, followed by labor-, time- and resource-consuming experiments which aim to verify the natural processing, presentation and t-cell recognition of the predicted peptides. as the veracity of initial in silico predictions improves, so subsequent "wet lab" work becomes faster, more efficient, and, ultimately, more successful.

the main processing pathway for major histocompatibility complex  class i ligands involves degradation of proteins by the proteasome, followed by transport of the products by the transporter associated with antigen processing  to the endoplasmic reticulum , where peptides are bound to mhc class i molecules, and then presented on the cell surface by mhcs. the proteasome is responsible for generating the c terminus but not the n terminus of the final presented peptide  <cit> . the proteasome is a multimeric proteinase with three active sites: a site with trypsin-like activity , one with chymotrypsin-like activity , and another with peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolytic activity   <cit> . in addition, in vertebrates there are three γ-interferon-inducible subunits that replace the constitutive subunits  <cit>  and assemble the immunoproteasome. the immunoproteasomes have an altered hierarchy of proteosomal cleavage, enhancing cleavage after basic and hydrophobic residues and inhibiting cleavage after acidic residues  <cit> . this is in accord with the amino acid preferences for binding to mhc class i molecules at the c terminus  <cit> .

tap is an atp-dependent peptide transport protein that belongs to the atp-binding cassette  family of transporters. this family transports across membranes a wide range of molecules, from small sugars to large polypeptides  <cit> . there are two tap proteins  which form a transmembrane  heterodimer. both proteins encode one hydrophobic tm domain and one atp-binding domain  <cit> . extant experimental studies have shown that tap prefers peptides of eight or more amino acids with hydrophobic or basic residues at the carboxy terminus  <cit> . tap-mediated antigen presentation is important not only for cytosolic antigens but also for most epitopes within membrane/secretory proteins  <cit> . the tap-dependent pathway is the principal processing route for peptides binding hla-a <dig>  hla-a <dig>  hla-a <dig>  hla-a <dig>  hla-b <dig> and hla-b <dig>  <cit> . some peptides are able to access the er via other, tap-independent mechanisms. examples of alleles exhibiting only partial dependence on tap include hla-a <dig>  hla-a <dig>  hla-b <dig> and hla-b <dig>  <cit> .

proteins of the mhc are both polygenic  and polymorphic   <cit> . each class of mhc has several loci: hla-a, hla-b and hla-c for class i and hla-dr, hla-dq and hla-dp for class ii. mhc alleles may differ by as many as  <dig> amino acid substitutions, most of them are found within the binding site and are critical for the specificity of peptide binding and therefore for t cell recognition  <cit> . such an uncommon degree of polymorphism implies a selective pressure to create and maintain it. different polymorphic mhc alleles have different peptide specificities: each allele binds peptides exhibiting particular sequence patterns.

successful t cell epitope prediction has always challenged bioinformatics. a wide range of computer-based algorithms have been developed to predict t-cell epitopes  <cit> . initially, methods for direct t cell epitope prediction were developed based on amphipathicy  <cit> , epitope pattern motifs  <cit> , or on a combination there of  <cit> . these direct epitope prediction methods have relatively low accuracy  <cit> . later, a broad spectrum of indirect predictive methods have been developed to predict mhc binders instead of t cell epitopes . they are based on motif patterns  <cit> , motif profiles  <cit> , quantitative matrices   <cit> , neural networks   <cit> , free energy scoring functions   <cit> , mhc-peptide threading  <cit> , 3d-qsar studies  <cit>  and support vector machines   <cit> . in general, methods of this type have out-performed older methods. in the meantime, methods for the prediction of proteasome cleavage  <cit>  and tap binding  <cit>  were developed. these methods attempt to model the early stages of the antigen processing pathway.

the next generation of t cell epitope identification methods will focus on integrated multi-step approaches, which subsume proteasome cleavage, tap transport and mhc binding. the advantages of such integrated methods are higher accuracy and a lower rate of false positive predictions, although they may generate more false negative predictions due to the use of incomplete training sets or high thresholds for individual steps. although some previous attempts have been made to combine predictive methods  <cit> , true integrated methods have only recently emerged, examples include: smm  <cit> , netctl  <cit>  and wapp  <cit> . smm stands for stabilized matrix method and is a t cell epitope predictive tool based on qms for binding to mhc class i molecules, peptide transport by tap and proteasomal  cleavage of protein sequences  <cit> . netctl implements, in a combined manner, ann-based proteasome cleavage prediction, a tap binding qm and ann-based mhc class i binding prediction  <cit> . wapp applies proteasomal cleavage matrices, svm-based tap and mhc predictions as a series of successive filters  <cit> . all three methods emphasize the greatly reduced number of peptides which need to be tested in order to identify true epitopes; they show good accuracy for sets they have been tested with.

in the present study, we develop a multi-step algorithm for t cell epitope prediction, which we call epijen. the method is applied to a set of overlapping peptides generated from a whole protein sequence and acts as a series of filters which successfully reduce the number of potential epitopes . the final set of peptides needed to be tested for epitopes rarely includes more than 5% of the whole sequence. qms for each step were developed using the additive method  <cit> . since its appearance in  <dig>  this method has been applied to more than  <dig> peptides binding to several human and murine mhc class i and class ii proteins  <cit>  and has been shown to be both reliable and highly predictive, allowing us to design superbinders  <cit> . the method was also used to generate qms for tap binding  <cit>  and proteasome cleavage  <cit> . recently, several new models have been developed for peptide binding to human mhc alleles: hla-a* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig> and hla-b* <dig> . here, we combine all additive method human models and make them publicly available via the epijen server for t cell epitope prediction  <cit> . the performance of epijen is tested using external sets of known t cell epitopes and is compared with the predictions made by smm, netctl and wapp methods.

RESULTS
epijen step one: proteasome cleavage
the dataflow in epijen is shown in figure  <dig>  initially, the protein is chopped into overlapping decamers and processed by a proteasome cleavage qm. a previously derived and tested p1p1' model, as described in the methods section below  <cit> , is used. the model takes into account only the contributions of the residues next to the cleavage site: c-terminus and the next aa. two thresholds,  <dig>  and  <dig> , can be used here. threshold  <dig>  is recommended for alleles which prefer phe or trp at the c-terminus: hla-a* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig> and hla-b* <dig>  the epitopes for other alleles are predicted accurately at a threshold of  <dig> . this initial step has a powerful filtering ability: between one half and two thirds of the true negatives were eliminated by this step. the "cleaved" peptides, present as nonamers, are then passed to the next filter: the tap binding qm.

epijen step two: tap transport
the tap binding qm also has been derived and tested previously  <cit> . a threshold of  <dig>  is recommended for both fully and partially tap-dependent alleles. pro and asp at anchor position  <dig> has a strong negative effect on tap binding  <cit> . for that reason, a threshold of  <dig>  is recommended for epitopes binding to hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig> and hla-b* <dig>  the filtering ability of the tap step is low. up to 10% of the true negatives are eliminated here. the "transported" peptides move to the next filter: mhc binding.

epijen step three: mhc binding
epijen includes  <dig> qms which can be used to predict binding to different hla-a and b alleles. certain qms were developed for single alleles and others developed for allele families. qms developed for whole supertypes were poorly predictive, especially for hla-b supertypes. some mhc models were derived previously  <cit> , while others were developed for this study. the statistics of newly derived models are given in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  quantitative data  were available for certain alleles, for the rest only sequences of binders were known . as is described in the methods section below, binding models based on continuous values were derived by multiple linear regression   and those based on discontinuous values by discriminant analysis  . "leave-one-out" cross-validation tests indicate a higher predictive rate for the da models  than mlr models . the filtering ability of this step is significant: approximately 25–30% of the true negatives are eliminated here. the thresholds for this step are  <dig>  for the da models and  <dig>  for mlr models. these thresholds can not be altered by the user. they seek to reduce the number of false positives in long protein sequences.

epijen step four: epitope selection
all peptides which are presented by mhcs on the cell surface after being cleaved by the proteasome and transported by tap could potentially be t cell epitopes. however, only a small number of all possible epitopes are actually immunogenic. to reduce the number of false positives we tested different thresholds, which we defined as percentages of available peptides sourced by one protein. the top 5% threshold performed best, giving 85% sensitivity; we recommend it and use it as a default value for this step. optional are thresholds  <dig>   <dig> and 4%.

external validation
a set of  <dig> epitopes and their source proteins were collected from antijen  <cit> . they were restricted by the human mhc allele families: hla-a* <dig>  hla-a* <dig>  hla-a* <dig>  hla-a* <dig>  hla-a* <dig>  hla-a* <dig>  hla-a* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig> and hla-b* <dig>  six epitopes were promiscuous. only proteins consisting of less than  <dig> amino acids were used in the study. the thresholds were selected as follows: at step  <dig>  a value of  <dig>  was chosen for hla-a* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig> and hla-b* <dig>  and  <dig>  for the rest; at step  <dig>  a value of  <dig>  for hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig> and hla-b* <dig>  and  <dig>  for the rest; at step  <dig>  a value of  <dig>  was selected for hla-a* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig> and hla-b* <dig>  and  <dig>  for the rest. for the final step  four thresholds were tested: top 2% to 5%. as the number of non-epitopes generated from each protein was significantly higher than the number of epitopes, only two parameters – sensitivity ) and positive predictive value  ) – were used for comparison. parameters accuracy /total) and specificity ) could be misleading. if 98% of the peptides in one source protein are non-epitopes, a model that simply predicts everything as non-epitope will not be very useful, yet it will nonetheless have an overall accuracy of 98% and a specificity of 100%.

the true positives were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . false negatives were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  while the false positives decreased from  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the parameter sensitivity varies from 69%  to 85%  . the parameter ppv diminishes from 10%  to 5% . thus, our tests indicate that a 5% threshold at the final epitope selection step is sufficient to generate an 85% epitope prediction. this means that by using epijen, one need only test 5% of the whole sequence in order to predict 85% of available epitopes. detailed results from the external validation are given in additional file  <dig>  which is provided as additional material.

comparison with smm, netctl and wapp
the ability of epijen to predict t cell epitopes was tested on a set of known t cell epitopes, which belonged to  <dig> hiv proteins, and the resulting predictions were compared with those made by smm, netctl and wapp. the comparisons were made in conditions close to those used by experimental immunologist: the complete sequence of a protein of interest is submitted to an available web server and the results recorded. netctl and wapp predictions were made using default thresholds. the top 5% best predicted peptides were selected as a threshold for smm and epijen. as wapp only predicts peptides binding only to hla-a* <dig>  hla-a* <dig>  hla-a* <dig> and hla-b* <dig>  but smm does not predict hla-b* <dig> binding, the epitopes used in the test set were restricted to the set of alleles common to all four programs: hla-a* <dig>  hla-a* <dig> and hla-a* <dig>  as described in methods, a set of  <dig> epitopes was compiled:  <dig> peptides binding to hla-a* <dig>   <dig> to hla-a* <dig> and  <dig> to hla-a* <dig>  three peptides were promiscuous, binding to both hla-a* <dig> and hla-a* <dig>  the predictions were compared in terms of sensitivity and ppv.

epijen recognized  <dig> out of  <dig> epitopes , followed by smm with  <dig> , netctl with  <dig> , and wapp with  <dig>  . the ppvs were low for all of the four methods: 21% for netctl, 17% for both epijen and wapp, and 16% for smm. detailed results from this comparative study are given in additional file  <dig>  which is provided as additional material.

discussion
epijen is a server for multistep t cell epitope prediction. the principal steps in the antigen processing pathway are modeled by a set of different qms. the models are applied successively, eliminating a proportion of negatives at each stage. proteasome cleavage  and tap transport  models are applied to all alleles. mhc binding  is more specific. several models are included here. some, like hla-a* <dig>  hla-a* <dig>  hla-a* <dig>  hla-a* <dig>  hla-a* <dig>  hla-a* <dig>  hla-a* <dig>  hla-a* <dig>  hla-a* <dig>  hla-a* <dig> and hla-a* <dig>  relate to single alleles. others, such as hla-a* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig>  hla-b* <dig> and hla-b* <dig>  are valid for whole allele families. the final epitope selection step  reduces the number of false positives by selecting the top  <dig> to 2% of the best binders.

epijen combines several widely used methods in drug design  <cit> , which have generally proven reliable and predictive. moreover, the external validation of epijen and the comparison with other integrated methods showed that epijen performed best in terms of sensitivity. the number of peptides that have to be tested in order to reach 85% reliability is 5% of a protein sequence. according to larsen et al.  <cit> , netctl, syfpeithi and bimas achieve 85% reliability within the top 7%, 10% and 9%, respectively. the moderate performance of all integrated methods when used to predict the hiv epitope set may be due to the fact that all peptides available in the los alamos hiv database were included, regardless of whether a peptide has been naturally processed or not. epijen excluded most of the false negative hiv epitopes after the proteasome cleavage step and only a few of them were predicted as nonbinders.

it is well known that "all models are wrong, yet some of them might be useful". the modeling process follows the accumulation of knowledge about a particular mechanism. as knowledge improves, so models improve. antigen processing is a very complicated cascade of cellular events. it is clear that, for example, cleavage by the proteasome is only one event in antigen presentation: there are many more, and many of these are proteolytic. analyses of peptide generation and t-cell epitopes expression in proteasome-inhibited cells suggest that cytoplasmic proteases other than proteasomes may also be involved in antigen processing pathway  <cit> . tripeptidylpeptidase ii  was suggested to supply peptides because of its ability to cleave peptides in vitro and its upregulation in cells surviving partial proteasome inhibition  <cit> . leucine aminopeptidase was found to generate antigenic peptides from n-terminally extended precursors  <cit> . puromycin sensitive animopeptidase and bleomycin hydrolase were shown to trim n termini of synthetic peptides  <cit> . an enzyme located in the lumen in er and called eraap   <cit>  or erap <dig>   <cit> , has been shown to be responsible for the final trimming of the n termini of peptides presented by mhc class i molecules. recently, it was shown that within the proteasome, peptides could be formed from noncontiguous parts of the source protein  <cit> . the mechanism of this splicing is not fully understood. currently there is insufficient quantitative data about the role of the above mentioned events to allow a precise bioinformatic evaluation of their impact on the antigen processing pathway. overall, it is clear that, ultimately, many more pathways, involving many more stages, will need to incorporated into predictive methods in order to model it accurately; given current data, however, epijen represents the most accurate and parsimonious approach to antigen prediction.

compared to other methods, epijen offers many potential advantages. first, a large quantity of experimental data  has been used to develop the models. second, the additive method combines two well known, widely used methods in drug design  <cit> , which have generally proven to be both reliable and predictive: the free-wilson method  <cit>  and partial least squares   <cit> . finally, and most importantly, epijen uses its models as successive filters: negatives are eliminated at each step rather than their score being summed in order to exceed a global threshold. this is in contrast to alternative methods  <cit> . the combined score, as used by smm and netctl, obscures the final result, because a low  tap and/or proteasome score could be compensated for by a high mhc score. the cellular antigen processing pathway, as modeled in epijen, works in a hierarchical or successive manner not in parallel. peptides that have been eliminated at any of the steps do not continue to the next step. epijen is thus based on a more mechanistically meaningful model of antigen presentation than other available methods. epijen is both a more adaptable and a more flexible approach, which should prove a significant advantage as combination methods, such as this, evolve.

CONCLUSIONS
epijen belongs to a new generation of integrated methods for t cell epitope prediction. it is an open system: new models will be included in the future, while old ones will be improved. integrated methods aim to rationalize the process of epitope searching and accelerate epitope-based vaccine design. they possess significant potential for improving the predictive ability of in silico epitope identification by adding more features and new high quality experimental data.
