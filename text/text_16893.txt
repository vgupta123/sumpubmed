BACKGROUND
in vivo, the paracoccidioides spp transition from mycelium to yeast cells is governed by an increase in temperature that occurs upon contact of the mycelia or conidia with the host. the fungus, a complex of several phylogenetic species, causes paracoccidioidomycosis , a human systemic mycosis. the infection begins with the inhalation of fungal propagules, which reach the epithelium of the alveoli, where the mycelium differentiates to the yeast pathogenic form  <cit> . although most clinical forms of the disease are asymptomatic, severe and progressive infections involving pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tissues occur  <cit> . a high percentage  of cases of the disease is reported in brazil, where pcm is the leading cause of death among the systemic mycoses. pcm is the eighth-leading cause of mortality among infectious and parasitic diseases, which establishes it as a serious public health problem  <cit> .

paracoccidioides malate synthase  appears to be important to the infectious process of paracoccidioides spp because the transcript is up-regulated during the transition from mycelium to yeast, during the infectious phase  <cit> , and in yeast cells during phagocytosis by murine macrophages  <cit> . pbmls participates in the glyoxylate pathway, which enables the fungus to assimilate two-carbon compounds, and in the allantoin degradation pathway of the purine metabolism, which allows the fungus to use nitrogen compounds  <cit> . in addition to being a crucial enzyme in the metabolism of paracoccidioides spp, pbmls is located in peroxisomes and in the cell wall of the fungus. it is capable of binding to extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin and collagen types i and iv and is also secreted by the fungus. furthermore, it has been demonstrated that this enzyme plays a role as an adhesin, having the ability to mediate host cell adhesion and internalization of paracoccidioides spp in a significant role in the establishment of infection  <cit> . therefore, there is evidence of pbmls functionality, which drives the investigation of these functions through studies of protein interactions.

the availability of all of the sequences of the paracoccidioides spp genome and the appearance of various techniques for the screening of protein-protein interactions makes it possible to discover the functions of fungal proteins of interest from the identification of their ligands  <cit> . therefore, this study was performed to identify paracoccidioides spp proteins that might interact with pbmls through techniques such as the yeast two-hybrid system  and affinity purifications coupled with mass spectrometry  analyses , to discover multi-protein assemblies that enable us to infer other functions of this enzyme and corroborate evidence of their multiple locations in the fungal cell. the interactions were also evaluated by in silico analysis.

RESULTS
tracking of protein interactions in vitro by pull-down assays
the pull-down technique detects the physical interactions between proteins most directly; as a result, it is a useful tool in the confirmation of protein-protein interactions predicted by other techniques  <cit> . here, pull-down assays were performed to search for interactions between pbmls and other proteins of paracoccidioides pb <dig> from different extracts because the fungus expresses different proteins depending on the phase  <cit> , which could lead to different pbmls-interacting proteins.

the recombinant proteins gst and pbmls fused to gst  were expressed, purified by using an affinity resin, and visualized by sds-page . the predicted mass for the hybrid protein pbmls-gst was  <dig>  kda . the proteins designated as  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were subjected to proteolysis and identification by ms. the proteomic identification data are compiled in additional file 2: table s <dig>  the results indicated that proteins  <dig> and  <dig> correspond to pbmls , but protein  <dig> is most likely a result of its proteolysis or incomplete translation. protein  <dig> was identified as membrane protein f of e. coli. the co-purification of proteins from e. coli has been described  <cit> . protein  <dig> corresponds to gst.

after purification, the gst bound to resin was incubated with protein extracts from paracoccidioides pb <dig> mycelium , yeast , yeast-secreted  and macrophage , to exclude nonspecific bindings that occur only in the presence of gst. the presence of only gst in lane  <dig>  indicated the absence of non-specific bindings to gst. next, the supernatant was removed and incubated with pbmls-gst bound to resin. the protein complexes formed during incubation were precipitated and resolved by sds-page .

proteins that interacted with pbmls, which are listed from  <dig> to  <dig> , were removed from the gel and identified by ms . proteins that interact with pbmls and that were detected by different pull-down assays were listed . the search against the ncbi non-redundant database using the ms/ms data was performed using mascot software v.  <dig>   <cit> . functional characterization was performed using uniprot databases  <cit>  and mips  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> pbmls-interacting proteins were identified . of these,  <dig> proteins were from macrophage and  <dig> were from paracoccidioides pb01;  <dig> were from mycelium,  <dig> were from yeast, and  <dig> were yeast-secreted. some proteins were found in more than one extract . no protein was found in both yeast and yeast-secreted extracts. of the  <dig> paracoccidioides pb <dig> proteins,  <dig> were exclusively extract . of  <dig> macrophage proteins,  <dig> were exclusive to macrophage, with  <dig> related to cytoskeleton. a total of  <dig> proteins  were also identified in the pull-down assays with paracoccidioides pb <dig> mycelium and/or yeast cells.

tracking of protein interactions in vivo by a two-hybrid assay
to detect new interactions between pbmls and other paracoccidioides pb <dig> proteins, two-hybrid assays were performed. the y <dig> strain of s. cerevisiae that harbors the bait  fused to the binding domain  of the gal <dig> transcription factor and the strain ah <dig> that harbors the prey  fused to the activation domain  of gal <dig> were placed in the same system to promote diploids.

the diploid yeast-expressing proteins that interacted were finally selected in medium that contained a chromogenic substrate  to observe the transcriptional activation of the reporter gene mel <dig>  a gal4-regulated gene coding for the α-galactosidase enzyme. a total of  <dig> clones showed the activation of the reporter gene mel <dig> by turning blue , which confirmed that there was interaction between pbmls and the gene products listed in the additional file 4: table s <dig> 

to identify gene products that interacted with pbmls, the cdnas of the clones were sequenced after pcr amplification. ests  were processed using the bioinformatics tool blast2go. the functional classification was based on the homology of each est against the genbank database using the blast algorithm  <cit> , with a significant homology cutoff of ≤ 1e- <dig> and functional annotation by mips  <cit> . additionally, sequences were grouped into functional categories through the pedant  <dig> database  <cit> . the analysis indicated the presence of several functional categories of genes and cell functions related to cellular transport, protein fate, protein synthesis, nucleotide metabolism, signal transduction, cell cycle and dna processing, and hypothetical protein .

construction of protein interaction maps
a comprehensive genetic interaction dataset has been described for the model yeast s. cerevisiae <cit> . because genes that act in the same pathway display similar patterns of genetic interactions with other genes  <cit> , we investigated whether paracoccidioides pb <dig> protein sequences that interacted with pbmls and were tracked by the pull-down and two-hybrid assays  were found in the structural genome database of s. cerevisiae <cit> . those sequences and others from the grid protein interaction database  <cit>  of s. cerevisiae were used to construct protein interaction maps generated by the osprey network visualization system  <cit>  . protein sequences from macrophage were not used because some of them were not found in the s. cerevisiae database. the blue lines indicate protein interactions with mls from paracoccidioides pb <dig> experimental data. the green lines indicate protein interactions with mls already described in the grid interaction database  <cit>  of s. cerevisiae. a pink line corresponds to both. the colored dots show the functional classification of proteins.

protein interactions obtained by a two-hybrid assay are shown in figure 1a. protein interactions obtained by pull-down assays with protein extracts of paracoccidioides pb <dig> mycelium, yeast and yeast-secretions are shown in figure 1b, c, and d, respectively. ubiquitin  was the only protein that interacted with mls that was found in both paracoccidioides and s. cerevisiae. the other proteins were identified in paracoccidioides pb <dig> or s. cerevisiae but not in both. although some proteins identified in paracoccidioides pb <dig> have homologous proteins in s. cerevisiae , these proteins could not yet be identified as interacting with pbmls. most of the paracoccidioides pb <dig> proteins that interacted with pbmls were related to the metabolism category.

confirmation of the interactions by far-western blot assays
far-western blot assays were conducted to confirm the interactions between pbmls and other proteins from the fungus identified by pull-down assays. pbmls was subjected to sds-page and was electro blotted. the membranes were reacted with protein extracts of paracoccidioides pb <dig> mycelium, yeast and macrophage  and were subsequently incubated with rabbit igg anti-enolase, anti-triosephosphate isomerase and anti-actin, respectively. the reactions were revealed with anti-rabbit igg conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. positive signals to the three extracts indicated the presence of an interaction between pbmls and enolase, triosephosphate isomerase and actin. negative control was obtained by incubating pbmls with the antibodies anti-enolase, anti-triosephosphate isomerase and anti-actin, respectively, without preincubation with the protein extracts . positive control was obtained by incubating the pbmls with the polyclonal anti-pbmls antibody .

another far-western blot assay was performed using membranes that contained protein extracts of paracoccidioides pb <dig> mycelium, yeast, yeast secretions, and macrophage . the membranes were incubated with pbmls and, subsequently, were incubated with antibody anti-pbmls and secondary antibody anti-rabbit igg. several proteins identified in the pull-down assays interacted with pbmls at this point, which suggested the veracity of the interactions. negative control was obtained by incubating each protein extract with the anti-pbmls antibody, without preincubation with pbmls . the numbers identify the proteins that interacted with pbmls, as shown in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

pbmls binds to the surface of macrophages
because the results from far-western blot assays revealed several macrophage proteins interacting with pbmls, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy to visualize whether pbmls could adhere to the surface of the macrophage cells. no binding was observed using bsa as a control . the arrow indicates pbmls binding to a macrophage surface .

pbmls participates in the adherence of paracoccidioides to pneumocyte cells
because the fungus initially reaches the lungs, the participation of pbmls in the adherence of paracoccidioides pb <dig> to pneumocyte cells was investigated by using confocal laser scanning microscopy. a <dig> cells were pretreated with anti-pbmls and infected with paracoccidioides pb <dig> isolate. after washings with frozen pbs-t, the monolayers were incubated with alexa fluor that was 594-conjugated for labeling the antibody. the arrows indicate pbmls interacting with the a <dig> surface .

homology models
in silico analysis was performed to investigate how the interactions identified by pull-down and two-hybrid assays could occur. some pbmls-interacting proteins from metabolic pathways such as the glycolytic pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the methyl citrate cycle and the glyoxylate cycle were selected for analysis. because pbmls participates in the glyoxylate cycle, interaction between proteins from different metabolic pathways would be expected. because no crystal structure of pbmls-interacting proteins described here was reported, a three-dimensional homology model for each protein was constructed based on the structure template listed in additional file 6: table s <dig>  all of the 3d-structure templates used to build models of the proteins have a resolution of <  <dig>  Å and an identity of > 49%, with a coverage of > 91%.

homology models of the pbmls-interacting proteins have very little conformational change when compared to their templates . the largest deviations were observed for enolase and fructose  <dig>  bisphosphate aldolase, with  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å of root mean square derivation  when superposed on the template when considering the non-hydrogen atoms. for enolase, there is a significant conformational change only in the c-terminal regions and between pro <dig> and asn <dig> .

alpha-helix-like secondary-structure patterns were observed in a greater proportion in the homology models pbmls-interacting proteins. for almost all of the structures, the alpha-helix-like pattern corresponded to more than 40% of the whole structure, while the beta-sheet-like pattern accounted for less than 20%, except for the protein ubiquitin, whose quantity of beta-sheet-like pattern was greater .

ramachandran plots of homology models were assessed stereo-chemically through the rampage web server  <cit>  . for all of the proteins, the Φ and Ψ distributions of the ramachandran plots were always above 94% in the favored regions and less than  <dig> % in the allowed regions. the quality factors of the structures were estimated by the errat web server and are summarized in additional file 6: table s <dig> 

molecular dynamics
all of the proteins were subjected to at least 20 ns simulation using gromacs software  <cit> . for the proteins gamma actin, 2-methylcitrate synthase, triosephosphate isomerase and ubiquitin, that time was insufficient to achieve rmsd stability of non-hydrogen atoms with respect to the structure homology models. in those cases, more simulation time was provided until this condition was achieved. the times required are listed for each protein. for almost all of the proteins, the deviations from their homology models were low . specifically, ubiquitin and 2-methylcitrate synthase had the highest rmsds. the increase was  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å after 60 ns and 40 ns, respectively. when only the residues from the interfaces of the complexes were considered, the rmsds increased  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, respectively .

the alpha-helix-like pattern was slightly reduced in all of the proteins that were binding to pbmls, but the beta-sheet-like structures almost did not change. although the rmsds were high for ubiquitin and 2-methylcitrate synthase, the alpha-helix-like patterns decreased to only  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.

molecular docking and molecular dynamics of the protein-protein complexes
molecular docking between pbmls and pbmls-interacting proteins was investigated by the gramm-x web server using the structures stabilized by dm. only the best model-structures provided by the server were selected. these complexes were then subjected to a rapid dm so that their structures could accommodate and avoid high energy at the interface between them, thus identifying residues in this region. significant conformational changes occurred in ubiquitin and 2-methylcitrate synthase when they were complexed with pbmls . the residues contacting at the interface of the complexes are shown in additional file 7: table s <dig>  and these amino acids are highlighted in figure  <dig>  some amino acid residues are common to different proteins. for example, asp <dig> and gln <dig> are residues of pbmls that interact with enolase and ubiquitin; asn <dig> is at the interface for gamma actin and ubiquitin; leu <dig> is common to triosephosphate isomerase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; and asp <dig> is common to 2-methylcitrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase.

the protein-protein complexes relaxed by dm were provided to the fiberdock web server, which determined the global energy for each complex . the results showed that fructose  <dig>   <dig> bisphosphate aldolase and ubiquitin were well stabilized when complexed with pbmls. the asp <dig> residue of pbmls is present in the interaction of both proteins.

discussion
our previous studies showed that pbmls is required in the metabolism of paracoccidioides pb <dig> acting in the glyoxylate cycle and in the allantoin degradation pathway. pbmls condenses acetyl-coa from both 2c sources  and nitrogen sources  to produce malate, which is a central molecule of the tricarboxylic acid cycle or glyoxylate cycle  <cit> . in addition, pbmls is located in the cytoplasm and on the fungal cell surface and is secreted, behaving like an anchorless adhesin  <cit> . the strong evidence for pbmls multifunctionality increased our interest in researching the possibility of new roles for pbmls through studies of protein-protein interactions, which aimed to identify pbmls-interacting proteins.

we searched for pbmls-interacting proteins using far-western blot, pull-down and two-hybrid techniques. the two-hybrid and pull-down are used as complementary techniques because the results depend on variants of the methods. the two-hybrid system is highly sensitive to detecting low-abundance proteins, unlike the pull-down system, which detects high-abundance molecules. additionally, the two-hybrid system allows identifying strong and weak interactions, while the pull-down is not a sensitive method for identifying some of the weak interactions because of the wash steps  <cit> . because the principles of the techniques are different, we have the capability of identifying different proteins.

pull-down assays were performed using paracoccidioides pb <dig> mycelium, yeast and yeast-secreted protein extracts because protein differences  <cit>  and metabolic differences, including changes in the pbmls transcript expression level  <cit> , were observed between both phases, which could lead to different pbmls-interacting proteins. in fact, considering mycelium and yeast,  <dig> proteins were exclusive to mycelium, and  <dig> were exclusive to yeast. in addition,  <dig> proteins were exclusive to yeast-secreted extract, and  <dig> were exclusive to macrophage. a total of  <dig> of those proteins were also identified by far-western blot. these findings suggest that pbmls appears to play a different role in paracoccidioides pb <dig> because it interacts with proteins from diverse functional categories.

several significant interactions were found. pbmls interacted with fatty acid synthase subunit beta, which catalyzes the synthesis of long-chain saturated fatty acids. pbmls interacted with 2-methylcitrate synthase and 2-methylcitrate dehydratase, which are enzymes of the cycle of 2-methylcitrate. this cycle is related to the metabolism of propionyl-coenzyme a , unlike the glyoxylate cycle, which is related to the metabolism of even-chain fatty acids. the interaction of pbmls with these enzymes suggests its involvement in fatty acid metabolism regulation.

the peroxisomal enzyme malate dehydrogenase, which participates in the glyoxylate cycle  <cit> , interacts with pbmls. in addition to having the signal peptide akl that targets peroxisomes  <cit> , pbmls was localized in that organelle  <cit> .

pbmls interacts with serine threonine kinase. it is known that protein kinases catalyze the transfer of the gamma phosphate of nucleotide triphosphates  to one or more amino acids of the protein side chain, which results in a conformational change that affects the function of the protein, resulting in a functional alteration of the target protein by altering enzymatic activity, cellular localization or association with other proteins  <cit> . thus, the interaction with a protein kinase suggests that pbmls could be regulated by phosphorylation. pbmls has a variety of sites, which indicates possible post-translational modifications, including protein kinase phosphorylation sites  <cit> . we have already described the regulation by phosphorylation of pbicl, the other enzyme unique to the glyoxylate cycle  <cit> .

the secretion of pbmls  <cit>  suggests that it interacts with fungus proteins themselves and host surface proteins. extracellular vesicles from paracoccidioides spp present proteins with many functions  <cit> . of  <dig> pbmls-interacting proteins,  <dig> were also found in the extracellular vesicle. extracellular proteins are known to play important roles, such as the uptake of nutrients, cell-cell communication and detoxification of the environment  <cit> . more specifically, proteins secreted by pathogenic microorganisms appear to play important roles in virulence  <cit> . corroborating our results, many proteins identified in this study, such as 2-methylcitrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, nucleoside diphosphate kinase, pyruvate kinase, hsp70-like protein and cobalamin-independent methionine synthase, had previously been described as secreted proteins in paracoccidioides pb <dig> secretome from mycelium and yeast cells  <cit> .

the adhesion of pathogens to host cells is considered to be an essential step in the establishment of infection  <cit> . several clinically important fungi, such as candida albicans, aspergillus fumigatus, histoplasma capsulatum and cryptococcus neoformans, are known to bind to proteins of the extracellular matrix   <cit> . the adhesins of fungi are important in the migration, invasion, differentiation and proliferation of microbes. paracoccidioides yeast cells also have the ability to adhere and invade host cells  <cit> . some adhesins, such as pbdfg5p  <cit> , triosephosphate isomerase   <cit> , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase   <cit> , and enolase   <cit> , and pbmls  <cit>  have been described in paracoccidioides pb <dig>  here, the interaction between pbmls and enolase and triosephosphate isomerase was confirmed by far-western blot assay. the interaction of pbmls with those proteins suggests that the joint action of those adhesins could promote adhesion to and invasion of host cells, acting as potent virulence factors.

pbmls appears to act in the interaction between paracoccidioides pb <dig> and macrophage because it interacts with several macrophage-specific proteins, of which  <dig> proteins are related to cytoskeleton, which suggests the involvement of that structure in the fungus adhesion process. the pbmls binding to actin was confirmed by far-western blot. the cytoskeletons of the macrophages control the movement of the cell membrane, which reflects the movement of the cell as a whole and are also involved in processes such as phagocytosis  <cit> . our previous work used far-western blotting and flow cytometry to show that pbmls binds to a <dig> cells. here, the participation of pbmls in paracoccidioides pb <dig> adhesion to and invasion of a <dig> cells was confirmed using confocal laser scanning microscopy.

some pbmls-interacting proteins were selected for in silico interaction analysis. proteins were chosen from metabolic pathways such as the glycolytic pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the methyl citrate cycle and the glyoxylate cycle because pbmls participates in the glyoxylate cycle, and the interaction between proteins from different metabolic pathways would be expected. global energy values for each complex studied showed that there is good complementarity between pbmls and most pbmls-interacting proteins. for example, the complexes that involve pbmls and the proteins glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate isomerase, malate dehydrogenase, 2-methylcitrate dehydratase and triosephosphate isomerase have global energies that are less than −55 kcal/mol. the global energy values found here were very good. for example, in a recent study of the interactions between d-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and phosphoserine aminotransferase from the enteric human parasite entamoeba histolytica <cit> , the best global energies were approximately −75 kcal/mol. here, the best values were found for fructose  <dig>  bisphosphate aldolase and ubiquitin .

s. cerevisiae mls-interacting proteins have already been described. here, in silico analysis using the s. cerevisiae database showed that pbmls interacts with other new proteins. the only protein that they share is ubiquitin. this fact and the fact that the interaction between ubiquitin and pbmls is very stable suggest that this interaction is very important. ubiquitin is responsible for the conjugation of proteins, marking them for selective degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system 26s, a process that is essential in the response to cellular stress. these proteins, however, act through ubiquitination, changing the function, the location and/or the traffic protein, or are targeted for destruction by the 26s proteasome  <cit> .

in conclusion, the molecular interactions that involve proteins located in subcellular compartments facilitate the understanding of mechanisms that are associated with each interaction. however, proteins are not always at the same location in the cell and do not have unique roles  <cit> . here, several new pbmls-interacting proteins from various functional categories were identified, which suggests that their function is diversified beyond the glyoxylate cycle.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study indicated that pbmls interacts with proteins of different functional categories, such as cellular transport, protein biosynthesis, modification and degradation and signal transduction. these data suggest that pbmls is found in many locations and plays different roles in the fungal cell.
