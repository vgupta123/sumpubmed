BACKGROUND
heterorhabditis bacteriophora is a rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode  symbiotic with the enteric bacterium photorhabdus luminescens, a dangerous liaison lethal to many insect hosts  <cit> . epns are applied globally for the biological control of insects. the nematode is also a potentially powerful animal model to study interspecies interactions such as mutualism, parasitism, and vector-borne disease. genomics and genetics are available for the symbiont, and because it is a close relative to caenorhabditis elegans, are being developed for the nematode. in addition, well-studied arthropod models  can be used as hosts  <cit> .

the developmentally arrested infective juvenile  nematodes exist in soil and transmit an average of  <dig> p. luminescens bacteria in their gut mucosa, sometimes for several months, before locating and infecting a suitable insect host  <cit> . the ijs search, locate and penetrate the insect exoskeleton or intestine, sometimes by using a buccal tooth, and then regurgitate the bacteria into the haemocoel . the association is an obligate mutualism since both the nematode and bacterium are required for insect pathogenicity.

the nematode is dependent on symbiotic bacteria for insect pathogenicity and nematode growth and reproduction since axenic ijs do not cause insect mortality nor develop and reproduce normally  <cit> . in contrast, p. luminescens are highly virulent when injected into the insect haemocoel, having an ld <dig> < <dig> cells for many insect hosts, but are dependent on the ijs for transmission and persistence outside of insect hosts. after the bacteria are regurgitated by the ijs  <cit> , insect mortality rapidly ensues  and the bacteria grow to high cell densities and produce insecticidal toxins, secondary metabolites to inhibit saprophytic microbes, bacteriophagous nematodes and savaging insects. in addition, the bacteria are required for nematode growth and reproduction  <cit> .

reproduction of h. bacteriophora is heterogonic: both automictic hermaphrodites and amphimictic females and males are formed  <cit> . the ijs are hermaphroditic, but generate automictic and amphimictic progeny that grow and reproduce for several generations on p. luminescens, after which, the hermaphroditic ij stage is formed. the ijs are specifically colonized by p. luminescens and transmit the bacteria to new insect hosts.

heterorhabditis bacteriophora is closely related to c. elegans  and can be propagated outside of insect hosts on agar based media and in liquid culture provided that a monoculture of symbiotic p. luminescens is present. we sought to further utilize the techniques and knowledge of c. elegans to study the interactions between h. bacteriophora, p. luminescens and insects.

one of these techniques is targeted gene silencing by rnai, a powerful molecular genetic tool to elucidate gene function. in c. elegans, rnai was originally performed by injecting dsrna into the body of l <dig> animals  <cit>  and also shown to be effective by soaking  <cit> , on lawns of bacteria expressing dsrna  <cit>  or by expressing dsrna in c. elegans cells  <cit> . rnai by feeding  <cit> , soaking  <cit>  and injection  <cit>  are amenable to high throughput methodologies. the dependence of h. bacteriophora for symbiotic bacteria for growth and reproduction makes rnai by feeding problematic. therefore, we developed a soaking protocol for efficient rnai in h. bacteriophora. using this protocol we detected highly penetrant and obvious phenotypes in h. bacteriophora for seven c. elegans orthologs, previously reported to have highly penetrant and obvious phenotypes in c. elegans. this is the first demonstration of rnai by soaking in h. bacteriophora, a technique difficult for many nematodes other than c. elegans perhaps due to inefficient uptake of environmental dsrna . this technique is amenable to high-throughput methodologies and should greatly enhance the analysis of gene function in h. bacteriophora.

RESULTS
optimization of rnai methodology for h. bacteriophora
since h. bacteriophora requires p. luminescens for growth and reproduction, one strategy for rnai might be to express h. bacteriophora dsrna in escherichia coli ht <dig>  delivered while in co-culture with p. luminescens. we tested the validity of this approach by determining if highly penetrant ds cel-pop- <dig> rna, retains silencing activity in c. elegans when grown in co-cultures of p. luminescens. c. elegans l <dig> grown on lawns of ht <dig> expressing ds cel-pop-1rna resulted in embryonic lethality  with 100% penetrance. however, silencing was abolished when as little as 2% p. luminescens were added  and to a lesser extent in the presence of 2% escherichia coli op <dig> . therefore, the strategy to deliver dsrna as a ht110-p. luminescens co-culture was not feasible, presumably due to nucleases produced by p. luminescens. we then attempted to use a soaking methodology to deliver dsrna for rnai in h. bacteriophora.

soaking l <dig> h. bacteriophora in m <dig> buffer resulted in high lethality . survival of l <dig> larvae was improved in s-basal media and found to be optimal in ringer's solution buffered with hepes . initial experiments soaking l <dig> larvae for  <dig> h in ringer's solution sometimes resulted in significant adult sterility. however, using l1s harvested from pure monocultures of p. luminescens, the adult nematodes were fertile. thus, a pure monoxenic culture of h. bacteriophora-p. luminescens is important for survival and development of the nematodes during and after rnai.

from  <dig> est sequences, kindly communicated by ann burnell , seven orthologs that had obvious and highly penetrant rnai phenotypes in c. elegans, were chosen for rnai by soaking in h. bacteriophora . three other ests whose c. elegans orthologs had no discernable rnai phenotype in c. elegans were also tested.

rnai of h. bacteriophora
the c. elegans cct- <dig>  gene encodes a component of eukaryotic t-complex chaperonin  <cit> . cct is a group ii chaperonin of similar structure to the prokaryotic groel chaperonin, but found only in eukarya and archea  <cit> . cct/tric is required to fold actin  <cit> , tubulin  <cit> , cyclin e <dig>  <cit>  and also 10% of newly synthesized cytoplasmic proteins  <cit> , including proteins with wd <dig> domains  <cit> . in c. elegans, mec- <dig> independent expression of cct- <dig> touch receptors has also been demonstrated, suggesting a role for cct in touch receptor function, possibly through microtubule assembly  <cit> .

in c. elegans, published rnai experiments of cct- <dig> resulted in embryonic lethal  and sterile  phenotypes  <cit>  and sometimes a protruding vulva  <cit> . rnai by feeding l <dig> c. elegans with bacteria expressing ds cel-cct- <dig> rna resulted in a highly penetrant ste phenotype with pvl also observed . soaking l <dig> h. bacteriophora in ds hba-cct- <dig> rna resulted in a highly penetrant  ste phenotype . the cause of sterility was likely due to defective gonad development and absence of germ cells . mature h. bacteriophora hermaphrodites which lack gonads have an empty or transparent appearance due to a void space in the pseudocoelom normally occupied by the gonad . both c. elegans and h. bacteriophora treated with their respective ds cct- <dig> rna were sterile and had abnormal gonads, although only c. elegans had a protruded vulva . the comparable penetrances of these phenotypes suggest that rnai by soaking in h. bacteriophora is nearly as efficient as by feeding in c. elegans.

the c. elegans daf- <dig> gene encodes a member of the hsp <dig> family of molecular chaperones important for maturation of signal transduction kinases in neurons involved in odorant perception and required for larval development  <cit> . hsp <dig> is also expressed in the gonad and required for germline development  <cit> , but is also expressed somatically during stress as part of the age- <dig> related aging regulon  <cit> . a published rnai experiment of daf- <dig> in c. elegans resulted in emb and ste phenotypes  <cit> . the post-embryonic phenotype of h. bacteriophora treated with ds hba-daf- <dig> rna resulted in sterile animals with abnormal gonad morphology . like rnai of hba-cct- <dig>  rnai of hba-daf- <dig> was highly penetrant .

the c. elegans icd- <dig>  gene encodes the beta subunit of nascent polypeptide associated complex  associated with the mitochondrial membrane and an inhibitor of apoptosis  <cit> . published rnai experiments of icd- <dig> in c. elegans resulted in emb, slow growth and ste phenotypes   <cit> . we detected highly penetrant ste, pvl, and defective gonad morphology phenotypes by feeding c. elegans ds-icd- <dig> . postembryonic rnai of h. bacteriophora resulted in ste phenotype due to an abnormal gonad with little germ cell proliferation . this phenotype was highly penetrant . we did not observe apoptosis in h. bacteriophora, and we were unable to generate sufficient males to observe defects in male tale rays, phenotypes observed in c. elegans  <cit> .

the c. elegans w01b <dig>  gene, recently named nol- <dig> , is predicted to encode an ortholog of the ribosome biogenesis protein nop58p/nop5p and is likely essential for information processing. published rnai experiments of cel-nol- <dig> usually resulted in larval arrest and emb phenotypes, with multivulva, protruding vulva, slow growth, maternal sterility and sterile progeny phenotypes also observed  <cit> . rnai by feeding ds cel-nol- <dig> rna resulted in pvl, ste with abnormal gonad development phenotypes . rnai of hba-nol- <dig> in h. bacteriophora resulted in a ste phenotype with abnormal gonads , which was highly penetrant .

the c. elegans gene w01g <dig> , like cel-nol- <dig>  is likely essential for information processing since it is predicted to encode subunit l of rna polymerase. rnai of w01g <dig>  in c. elegans resulted in emb phenotype with several other growth defects observed   <cit> . rnai of hba-w01g <dig>  resulted in ste phenotype with an abnormal gonad, likely due to the essential role for this protein in cell viability and division . this phenotype was highly penetrant, with >83% of adults being sterile with abnormal gonads .

the c. elegans rack- <dig>  gene is predicted to encode the homolog of mammalian receptor of activated c kinase. published rnai experiments of cel-rack- <dig> in c. elegans resulted in less obvious and penetrant phenotypes than those described above: emb, slow growth, egg laying defect, aldicarb resistance, and larval lethality  <cit> . rnai of hba-rack- <dig> resulted in 10–82% of animals with a ste phenotype and abnormal gonad development . thus, lower penetrances were observed using ds-rack- <dig> rna for both h. bacteriophora and c. elegans.

the c. elegans arf- <dig>  gene encodes a predicted adp-ribosylating factor . arfs are known to regulate membrane trafficking and the actin cytoskeleton, phospholipase d <dig> and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase  <cit> . rnai of cel-arf- <dig> resulted in emb and a variety of other defects   <cit> . rnai of hba-arf- <dig> resulted in a ste phenotype with abnormal gonads in 50%, 67% and 47% in each of three trials .

the c. elegans ben- <dig>  gene, also known as tbb- <dig>  encodes the beta subunit of tubulin, which when disrupted, results in resistance to benzimidizole  <cit> . rnai of ben- <dig> in c. elegans usually resulted in no observed defect  <cit>  although emb, abnormal post-embryonic development, larval arrest and larval development were sometimes observed  <cit> . rnai of hba-ben- <dig> in h. bacteriophora usually resulted in no observable defect, although a ste  phenotype was observed in two experiments.

the c. elegans mrp- <dig>  gene is predicted to encode a multidrug-resistance associated  protein related to human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, cftr. rnai of mrp- <dig> in c. elegans resulted in no observed phenotype  <cit> . since the p. luminescens symbiont of h. bacteriophora produces several known secondary metabolites, such as hydroxystilbene antibiotics, anthraquinone pigments  <cit>  and a photobactin siderophore  <cit> , it is possible that h. bacteriophora multidrug-resistance associated proteins might be involved in exporting these secondary metabolites. rnai of hba-mrp- <dig> in h. bacteriophora resulted in no observed defect in two trials and 10% sterility in one trial . it is likely that h. bacteriophora, like c. elegans  <cit> , has several multidrug-resistance associated proteins and this redundancy might be responsible for the weak phenotype from rnai of hba-mrp- <dig>  alternatively, other resistance mechanism might be employed to resist secondary metabolites produced by p. luminescens.

the c. elegans nhr- <dig>  gene is predicted to encode a nuclear hormone receptor and is induced upon worm exposure to estradiol  <cit> . published rnai experiments of cel-nhr- <dig> in c. elegans resulted in no observed phenotype  <cit> . similarly, rnai of hba-nhr- <dig> in h. bacteriophora usually resulted in no observed phenotype, although 12% and 3% ste animals were observed .

quantification of rnai by real-time rt-qpcr
to determine the extent of rnai silencing in h. bacteriophora, quantitative real-time rt-qpcr experiments were performed. message levels of hba-cct- <dig> and hba-nol- <dig> were quantified relative to hba-ben- <dig> when treated with the specific or unspecific dsrna . relative amounts of mrna were determined using the ΔΔct method. rnai of hba-cct- <dig> resulted in mrna levels  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> relative to the nonspecific dsrna control. rnai of hba-nol- <dig> resulted in mrna levels  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> relative to the nonspecific dsrna control. rnai of hba-ben- <dig> resulted in mrna levels  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10-4relative to two nonspecific dsrna controls: hba-nol- <dig> in an hba-cct- <dig> rnai experiment or hba-cct- <dig> in a hba-nol- <dig> experiment, respectively. from these data we conclude that rnai by soaking in h. bacteriophora is potent and specific.

rnai treated h. bacteriophora are normal in symbiotic host-bacterial interactions
one of our goals for developing rnai in h. bacteriophora is to use this technique along with imminent high quality draft  h. bacteriophora genome sequence , to identify genes involved in symbiotic host-bacterial interactions. many of the genes silenced have essential functions in the nematode and we sought to determine if these rnai treated animals have defects in symbiotic host-bacterial interactions. rnai treated worms for all  <dig> genes described above were reared on gfp-labeled p. luminescens and observed for bacterial colonization in the adult nematode intestine. no difference was seen in the presence of gfp-labeled p. luminescens in the intestines of rnai treated and untreated worms . this observation suggests that specific genes involved in symbiotic host-bacterial interactions can be identified using rnai.

CONCLUSIONS
gene silencing by rnai is a powerful reverse genetic tool to study gene function. although, rnai using long dsrna is robust in c. elegans, it is inefficient in many other nematodes. the robustness of rnai in c. elegans can be partially attributed to the systemic rnai defective gene, cel-sid- <dig>  involved in the transport of long dsrna  <cit>  and recently, cel-sid- <dig> required for efficient transport of dsrna in the c. elegans intestine  <cit> . recently, the systemic rnai defective gene, hba-sid- <dig>  was identified in h. bacteriophora  <cit>  which might partially explain the obvious phenotypes and high penetrances of rnai in h. bacteriophora. because the nematode egg yolk is synthesized by intestinal cells, it is possible that the ste and gonad defective phenotypes are caused by rnai of only the nematode intestinal cells. however, the low amounts of transcript levels detected in l1s following rnai suggests that rnai is nearly systemic. this hypothesis could be tested, in principle, by performing rnai on muscle tissue, for example by silencing the unc- <dig> gene conferring a twitching phenotype to c. elegans  <cit> . attempts to use degenerate primers to amplify hba-unc- <dig> were not successful and hba-unc- <dig> has not been found in existing h. bacteriophora est datasets. after the completion of the h. bacteriophora genome, this and many other rnai experiments will be performed.

this study demonstrates that rnai by soaking is an efficient methodology for gene silencing in h. bacteriophora, which can be applied to study many aspects of the unique biology including parasitism and mutualism. one limitation to this methodology is the development of rnai treated nematodes to adults versus the infective juvenile stage, the later which transmits the symbiotic bacteria and are insect parasitic. the lack of ij development from rnai treated larvae is likely due to the large amount of food signal provided by the confluent lawn of p. luminescens on which the l1s are placed. the density of l <dig> larvae might also influence the development of the l <dig> larvae to the ij stage. the severe and highly penetrant phenotypes observed here suggests that rnai will be a useful tool to study gene function in h. bacteriophora, i.e. related to symbiont transmission, parasitism, sex determination, stress resistance and infective juvenile formation.

more generally, mixed results concerning the efficiency of rnai have been reported in several clades of parasitic nematodes  <cit> . problems encountered using rnai in parasitic nematodes includes non-target effects of dsrna, variable efficiencies of rnai with regard to the target gene silenced and dsrna preparation, and in vitro cultivation. these problems appear to be less of a concern for h. bacteriophora due to the high specificity and penetrances of rnai. in the potato cyst nematode globodara padilla, rnai of neuronal fmrf amide-like peptides was surprisingly robust  <cit> . the results reported here are promising to the applicability of rnai to study gene function in h. bacteriophora. however, further refinements of the rnai methodology are expected when targeting diverse genes expressed in different tissues, when applied to nematodes of different developmental stages and when applied to larger gene sets.
