BACKGROUND
typical eukaryotic genes are composed of several relatively short exons that are interrupted by long introns. the primary transcripts of most eukaryotic genes are composed of introns and exons separated by canonical splice sites. these mrna precursors are shortened by a process called rna splicing in which the intron sequences are removed yielding the mature transcript consisting of exons only  <cit> . however, cells can splice the primary transcript in different ways and thereby generate different polypeptides from the same gene . this process is called alternative splicing. the different polypeptides are termed alternatively spliced gene products, splice variants or protein isoforms  <cit> .

to generate correctly spliced, mature mrnas, the exons must be identified and joined together precisely and efficiently by a complex process that requires the coordinated action of five small nuclear rnas  and more than  <dig> polypeptides  <cit> . according to  <cit> , five common modes of alternative splicing are known:  exon skipping or inclusion,  alternative 3' splice sites,  alternative 5' splice sites,  mutually exclusive exons, and  intron retention which corresponds to no splicing. in complex pre-mrnas, more than one of these modes of alternative splicing can apply to different regions of the transcript, and extra mrna isoforms can be generated through the use of alternative promoters or polyadenylation sites  <cit> .

alternative splicing is a frequent process in eukaryotes. it is estimated that up to  <dig> percent of human genes are subjected to alternative splicing  <cit> . thus, alternative splicing is probably an important source of protein diversity in higher eukaryotes. for example, the fruitfly drosophila melanogaster contains fewer genes than caenorhabditis elegans while exhibiting significantly higher protein diversity  <cit> . furthermore, alternative splicing of primary transcripts is often tissue- or stage-specific , and is thus an important regulatory mechanism.

for a protein in an organism, other proteins can be found that are homologous, i.e. that are similar due to common evolutionary ancestry. following fitch  <cit> , there can be orthologs, which are homologs due to a speciation event, and paralogs, which are homologs due to a duplication event. even if genomic information on intron/exon-structure is not available, isoforms can usually be visually distinguished from homologs based on protein sequence alone, since only the latter feature substitutions with respect to each other . for the remainder of this paper, without loss of generality, we will consider paralogs only. comparing a protein with an isoform of its paralog, we still find a predominance of substitutions, and we consider these two proteins to be paralogs.

available databases of proteins and their isoforms consider only a small number of protein families and species . we wanted to identify isoforms without knowledge of genomic information and independently of specific protein families or species, in a fashion well suited for high-throughput genomics and proteomics.

visual inspection of large datasets such as complete proteomes  would be time-consuming and prone to misclassifications. to enable automation, a set of three different features was derived based on the pairwise alignment of the two protein sequences to be compared. these features take into account such parameters as the distribution of substitutions and sequence similarity. the three features are overall sequence similarity, the number of consecutive blocks of identities or non-identities  and the overall number of consecutive matches , see also figures  <dig> and  <dig>  and methods, section features.

for automation the approach of supervised learning using a support vector machine   <cit>  was chosen. svms are gaining popularity in bioinformatics  <cit>  and are often superior to neural networks and bayesian learning  <cit> . svm classifiers distinguish two classes of input data by calculating separating hyperplanes  in a vector space v that is endowed with a dot product. the dot product is used as a measure of similarity. data samples from the input space are mapped to the vector space v , making it easier to find a separating hyperplane. the position and margin of the hyperplane are optimized in v, maximizing the distance of the hyperplane to instances of both classes. the kernel function used to measure similarity behaves in input space like the dot product in space v. thus, similarity of input data can be measured easily in v. without a kernel function, computation of the dot products in v would be necessary, consuming a large amount of time, depending on the structure of v. for an in-depth description of properties and theory of svms, please see  <cit> . the support vector machine implementation svmlight  <cit>  was used. in this paper, we introduce a highly accurate svm-based method to distinguish between isoforms and paralogs on the protein level . our software is freely available on the web .

RESULTS
importance of maximizing accuracy in distinguishing isoforms and paralogs
why does isoform detection require such a high degree of accuracy? why do we want to use an svm even though this approach is usually employed in case the input space has dimensionality  larger than three? for example, when performing  <dig>  sequence comparisons, even a  <dig> % improvement in accuracy results in  <dig> fewer misclassifications. such numbers are typical, for example, in applications of our automated phylogeny pipeline ripe  <cit> . analyzing a large protein family with ripe, few misclassifications make a difference since paralogs misidentified as isoforms  are deleted from the dataset, which may result in the loss of key members of the protein family, compromising the interpretation of the evolution of sequence, domain structure and function.  do not pose a major problem.)

performance statistics of different classifiers based on three features
we investigated three different classifiers designed to distinguish isoforms and paralogs. we calculated the mean accuracy and standard error of the mean for an svm, a radial basis function  network  <cit>  and a linear classifier. classification was based on three features and samples were derived from protein data taken from genbank  <cit>  . the svm classifier showed better accuracy and a smaller standard error of the mean than the two other classifiers. in detail, the svm classifier shows a mean accuracy of  <dig> % and a standard error of  <dig> . in contrast, the classifier based on the rbf network shows a mean accuracy of  <dig> % and a standard error of  <dig> , while for the linear classifier a mean accuracy of  <dig> % and a standard error of  <dig>  was observed. mean accuracy, mean precision and true positive/true negative  and false positive/false negative  numbers for the three classifiers are given in table  <dig> and illustrated in figure  <dig> 

performance of different classifiers using a canonical training/testing dataset
in the following, we report results that are not supported by resampling but derived from a specific  training and testing dataset . in this way, we were able to explore, on a large  dataset, a wide variety of classifiers in reasonable time.

the svm classifier distinguishes isoforms and paralogs of the canonical testing dataset with an accuracy of  <dig> % and a precision of  <dig> % . all three sequence-based features used by the svm  contributed to accuracy; results based on any combination of two features only were inferior, as shown in table  <dig> 

a linear classifier that was calculated using all three features of the samples in the canonical training dataset was found to classify the canonical testing dataset with an accuracy of  <dig> %. linear classifiers that were trained using all possible combinations of only two features showed at least slightly inferior results compared to the linear classifier based on all three features. not surprisingly, the best-performing classifier based on two features does not use the weakest feature that is sequence similarity. classifiers based on sequence similarity alone appear to be weak in distinguishing between isoforms and paralogs and perform much worse than any other of the tested classifiers; a linear classifier derived by line-sweeping using the feature sequence similarity alone results in an accuracy of approximately 82%. linear classifiers based on one of the other features perform surprisingly well, however .

finally, the radial basis function  network classifier  <cit>   applied to the canonical testing dataset using all three features results in an accuracy of  <dig> %.

application of the svm classifier to est data
as a first real-life application we used isosvm to search for isoforms within the cap3-derived contigs of  <dig> xenopus laevis est clusters  <cit> . xenopus laevis, as an allotetraploid species, has undergone a genome wide duplication. therefore, many genes are represented by two paralogs. isoforms of x. laevis proteins have not been studied yet in any systematic way. sequencing the x. laevis genome is made difficult by its sheer size, and genomic sequence data are too few in number to study intron-exon structures of most genes. contigs were derived from  <dig>  xenopus ests downloaded from genbank. after cleanup of the est data , sequences were clustered using an enhanced suffix array based approach  <cit>  implemented in the tool vmatch  <cit> . clustering resulted in  <dig>  clusters which were assembled into  <dig>  contigs using cap <dig>  <cit> . table  <dig> summarizes the results of the clustering process.

to assess whether the splitting of clusters by cap <dig> into several contigs was caused by grouping isoforms into the same cluster, or whether the splitting was due to paralogs, we extracted  <dig> clusters that have multiple contigs , and for which each contig has a full length protein match in the protein nr database  <cit> . most of the  <dig> clusters consist of only two contigs and only a fraction features three or more contigs. treating each contig consensus as a sequence,  <dig>  sequence pairs were compared by isosvm within clusters;  <dig> of these samples  were classified as isoforms and  <dig>  as paralogs .  <dig> samples were left out, representing contigs with almost no overlap, i.e. sequence pairs of low  similarity. as a further check, to assess the accuracy of this analysis,  <dig> randomly chosen samples were reviewed manually and the result was noted ; an accuracy of  <dig> % and a precision of  <dig> % was found. 

application of the svm classifier to an automated phylogeny pipeline
as a second application, the classifier was incorporated into a pipeline for automatic generation of protein phylogenies called ripe  <cit> , with the aim to further reduce the redundancy of the ripe-retrieved protein data by recognizing and deleting sequences that are isoforms. isoforms are usually considered irrelevant data in phylogenetic tree inference and analysis. ripe data are generated by homology search , retrieving hits with putative homology to a search profile and assembling hsp-based homologous-regions-only data as described in methods, section homologous regions only. the pipeline already features a redundancy minimization stage, sorting out hits that are similar to other hits . the isosvm classifier was incorporated, enabling the detection and deletion of isoforms, thus decreasing dataset size and redundancy while simultaneously increasing computational speed and legibility of the phylogenetic tree. we first tested the ability of our classifier to deal with homologous-regions-only data , noting an accuracy of  <dig> % and a precision of  <dig> % . training on homologous-regions-only data did not improve classifier performance .

following our interest in abc  proteins, which are found in a wide variety of species and are of major biomedical importance, a dataset of  <dig>  abc protein hits was then retrieved by ripe from  <dig> model proteomes  using  <dig> known human abc proteins  <cit>  as search profile.  <dig> hits were identified as isoforms of another hit by the svm classifier. as a further check, all  <dig> putative isoforms were inspected visually, the automatic classification  was checked, and a precision of  <dig> % was found. the accuracy of the classifier was not calculated in this case since ripe reports only samples classified as positives . while the precision reported is based on the number of false positives , assessment of accuracy would require the visual inspection of tens of thousands of samples of  paralogs, i.e. putative false negatives. removal of isoforms resulted in a reduction of dataset size by about 8%, rendering the eukaryotic parts of the tree much more legible.

limitations of the classifier
despite showing reliable performance, the svm classifier is not perfect. it may misleadingly classify a small portion of paralogs with high similarity as isoforms, since they feature long stretches of identical amino acid sequence. further, sequences that are fragments of other sequences will be classified as isoforms.

CONCLUSIONS
the svm classifier, trained using visually classified cases of isoform and paralog relationships, proved to be reliable in all tests, exhibiting an accuracy of over 97% and a precision of over 95%. we are thus able to distinguish isoforms and paralogs in a satisfactory way, no matter whether full-length, homologous-regions-only or est cluster sequences are handled. in particular, for species such as xenopus laevis, for which few detailed analyses of the evolution of genes and proteins exist, the analysis of paralogs and isoforms can improve statistical models of sequence evolution, e.g. regarding the likelihood of gene duplication and alternative splicing. overall, the isosvm tool should be useful for researchers in several fields of genomic research and est analysis as a reliable method of automatic isoform identification. our software is freely available at the isosvm website  <cit> , under an open source license.
