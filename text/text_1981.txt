BACKGROUND
β-catenin is an armadillo family protein that serves as a gene expression regulator in canonical wnt signaling, in addition to its function in cell adhesion  <cit> . the canonical wnt pathway involves the inhibition of gsk3α/β , dissociation of the β-catenin destruction complex that contains apc and axin proteins, and subsequent accumulation of the cytoplasmic pool of β-catenin that can translocate into the nucleus and activate lef1/tcf transcription factors  <cit> . the crucial role of this pathway in cell differentiation and proliferation is well established, and mutations in its components lead to severe malformations in developing embryos and cancer in adults  <cit> .

the nuclear mediators of canonical wnt signaling include the transcription factors lef <dig>  tcf <dig> , tcf7l <dig> , and tcf7l <dig> , which are members of the high mobility group  family  <cit> . the hmg dna binding domain of lef1/tcfs recognizes the wwcaaag consensus sequence. the n-terminus of lef1/tcf recruits β-catenin, which does not bind to dna itself but has a strong transactivation domain. the remaining regulatory domains and alternatively spliced c-termini of the proteins vary between these members and provide a molecular basis for the diversity and context dependence of lef1/tcfs function. lef1/tcf genes are highly expressed during mouse embryogenesis, but their transcripts are virtually undetectable postnatally  <cit> , except for intestinal and hair follicle stem cells  <cit> . surprisingly, high levels of lef <dig> and tcf7l <dig> expression have been observed in the thalamus in the adult brain  <cit> .

growing evidence suggests the involvement of canonical wnt signaling in the proper functioning of the adult central nervous system  <cit> . aberrant regulation of this pathway has been associated with psychotic and affective disorders   <cit>  and neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . however, the physiological role of wnt/β-catenin in the adult brain is far from understood. the transcriptional activity of β-catenin has been implicated in adult neurogenesis  <cit>  and gliogenesis  <cit> . these functions resemble the role of wnt/β-catenin signaling during neuronal development. nonetheless, nuclear β-catenin has also been shown to accumulate in mature neurons - in hippocampal cells upon nmda  receptor activation  <cit>  and constitutively in thalamic cells  <cit> . the identification of β-catenin target genes in neurons may provide insights into its role in these cells and the adult brain.

most of the approximately  <dig> known β-catenin targets are involved in development and cancer. in differentiated neurons, only a few genes have been shown to be activated by β-catenin; several are already known wnt target genes that are not neuron-specific  <cit> . as we recently demonstrated, a new target, cacna1g, encodes voltage-gated ca2+ channels  <cit> . in this work, we identified in silico and experimentally validated a novel group of β-catenin-lef1/tcf targets in thalamic neurons, consisting of genes that encode proteins that are important for neuronal function, including voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels and the ca2+-binding protein calretinin. this indicates a role for β-catenin and lef1/tcf transcription factors in the maintenance of neuronal excitability.

RESULTS
putative lef1/tcf target genes identified in silico are enriched in known wnt targets
to find putative β-catenin target genes, we screened for lef1/tcf family motifs in rat and human conserved regions within  <dig> kb upstream and downstream of transcription start sites . we relied on the fact that enhancers are enriched in proximity to tsss  <cit> , and the clustering of tcf7l2-bound regions occurs within  <dig> kb of tsss in colorectal cancer  <cit> . using established bioinformatics tools with their default parameters, we identified  <dig>  genes with at least one rat-to-human conserved lef1/tcf motif and  <dig> genes that contain at least two lef1/tcf motifs in the same conserved noncoding sequences . these two lists were compared with experimentally established wnt target genes cataloged at http://www.stanford.edu/group/nusselab/cgi-bin/wnt/target_genes . the degree of overlap between our lists and the list on the wnt homepage shows that the wnt targets are highly overrepresented among the genes that contain the predicted conserved lef1/tcf binding site. this positively validated our bioinformatics approach to identifying lef1/tcf targets. for further analysis, we selected only the genes with at least two lef1/tcf motifs in one regulatory element, expecting fewer false-positive hits in this group. this presumption was based on the observation that more than 30% of the genes that contain pairs of tcf7l <dig> motifs in the same cns display wnt target-like patterns during mouse development  <cit> . we excluded genes with a “null” or “predicted” description in the ensembl database, creating a final list of  <dig> rat genes , which we considered putative lef1/tcf targets.

putative lef1/tcf targets are enriched in neuron-specific genes 
we performed a gene ontology  analysis of the  <dig> putative targets using david functional annotation tools  to identify functionally related groups of genes. as expected, our list was highly enriched in genes involved in development, patterning, and cell proliferation . other predictable categories of molecular function and biological processes were overrepresented: specific dna binding , wnt signaling, and cell migration, adhesion, and death. unexpectedly, we found statistically significant enrichment in genes implicated in neuronal function, including genes for synaptic proteins and voltage-gated cation channels . based on this analysis, we hypothesized that β-catenin-lef1/tcf can regulate specific neuronal genetic programs. we collected the genes that were annotated with “synapse” and “gated-channel activity” terms and included a few other genes that failed to be annotated with the above go terms, although they obviously belong to these categories . several genes were also excluded because they were not brain-specific . the final collection contained  <dig> putative neuronal lef1/tcf targets grouped into five categories: nine vgccs,  <dig> neurotransmitter receptors, eight proteins involved in synaptic vesicle organization,  <dig> synaptic structural proteins, and three other proteins implicated in synaptic transmission . all of these gene targets were chosen for experimental validation.

vgcc genes with conserved lef1/tcf motifs compared with all other vgcc genes display preferential expression in the thalamus 
to initially validate our bioinformatics predictions, we concentrated on the vgcc group. the relative mrna levels of the ensemble of vgcc genes were measured in three different parts of the forebrain: thalamus, cortex, and hippocampus. we expected that the vgcc genes that are postulated lef1/tcf targets would be preferentially expressed in the thalamus because nuclear β-catenin and lef <dig> and tcf7l <dig> transcription factors are present in thalamic neurons but not cortical or hippocampal neurons  <cit> . the comparative expression analysis was performed using custom-designed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  arrays with six independent preparations from each brain region. the arrays contained all vgcc genes that have cnss , excluding a few genes that are known to be expressed only in non-neuronal tissues.

the genes that are putative lef/tcf targets are in bold.

the expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> vgcc genes was detected in the forebrain; no signal was obtained for kcnip <dig> and kcnj <dig>  four of nine putative lef1/tcf target vgcc genes were expressed at least two-fold higher in the thalamus than in the cortex and hippocampus, and none were expressed at a lower level. in the remaining group of  <dig> genes, four were expressed at a higher level in the thalamus, and six were expressed at a lower level . fisher’s exact test, yielding a p value of  <dig> , confirmed a correlation between thalamic expression and being a putative lef1/tcf target. this validated the approach to identifying new lef1/tcf targets based on combined in silico binding site prediction and high expression in the thalamus .

more than 20% of neuron-specific genes with conserved lef1/tcf motifs are highly expressed in the thalamus 
we next expanded the analysis and profiled the expression of all  <dig> genes listed as putative neuronal targets of lef1/tcf  in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. another set of custom-designed rt-qpcr arrays and the previous six independent preparations from each brain region were used. our aim was to determine which of the predicted targets are highly expressed in the thalamus, suggesting their actual regulation by β-catenin-lef1/tcf.

the expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> genes was detected in the forebrain; no signal was obtained for htr3b. in the thalamus, nine genes  were expressed at least two-fold higher than in the cortex and hippocampus , and the differences were statistically significant . in the cortex vs. the other two regions, two genes  were expressed at a higher level, and no single gene was highly expressed in the hippocampus .

the following genes had higher expression levels in the thalamus: four vgcc genes , four genes that represent neurotransmitter receptors , and the calb <dig> gene that encodes the ca2+ buffer calretinin . the genes from two other categories  did not show specific thalamic expression.

β-catenin is associated with chromatin at the cacna1g, kcna <dig>  gabra <dig>  grid <dig>  and calb <dig> loci in the thalamus
gene profiling in the rat brain allowed us to observe a positive association between the relative expression of the neuronal genes with at least two conserved lef1/tcf motifs and the presence of β-catenin and lef1/tcf factors in the brain. to determine whether the β-catenin-lef1/tcf complex might directly regulate cacna1g, cacna2d <dig>  kcna <dig>  kcnh <dig>  drd <dig>  gabra <dig>  glra <dig>  grid <dig>  and calb <dig>  we analyzed the in vivo binding of β-catenin to lef1/tcf motifs within the cnss using a chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay with designed primers . we also examined the chromatin conformational state of the fragments that contained conserved lef1/tcf motifs by precipitating them with an antibody specific for acetyl-histone h <dig> . in each chip assay, we compared four independent samples of chromatin isolated from the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus.

the positions of the primers are shown in figure  <dig> 

we first assessed the acetylation status of histone h <dig> at the gapdh promoter and gapdh exon, an open and close chromatin region, respectively. we found high levels of h3ac in the promoter while much lower levels in the first exon. this showed that our chip assays to monitor h3ac was specific . we then analyzed the chromatin conformation of our genes of interest in fragments with conserved lef1/tcf motifs. the chromatin fragments that were in close proximity to tsss, cacna1g- <dig> and kcnh8- <dig>  appeared to be in an open state. the same was observed for some fragments located distally from the tsss , whereas other fragments precipitated with low efficiency , indicating the closed conformation of chromatin . in most cases, no differences were found between the analyzed brain structures. however, some fragments  precipitated significantly more efficiently from the thalamic samples than from the cortex and hippocampus.

we then performed a chip assay with an anti-β-catenin antibody. to determine the background, normal immunoglobulin g  was used, which precipitated <  <dig> % of the input. the signals for all of the examined fragments were at background levels in the case of the cortex and hippocampus . however, when the thalamic samples were used, fragments of gabra <dig>  grid <dig>  cacna1g, kcna <dig>  and calb <dig> precipitated with anti-β-catenin at levels of  <dig> - <dig> % , indicating the binding of β-catenin to these fragments. moreover, for all of these fragments, the differences in chromatin precipitation levels between the thalamic samples and other samples were statistically significant. this indicates that the aforementioned genes can be directly regulated by β-catenin and lef1/tcf factors. interestingly, no correlation was observed between the β-catenin-chromatin interaction  and acetylation status of histone h <dig> in the chromatin fragments .

attenuation of β-catenin signaling leads to decreases in cacna1g, cacna2d <dig>  kcna <dig>  kcnh <dig>  gabra <dig>  and calb <dig> expression in cultured thalamic neurons
finally, we examined the effect of nuclear β-catenin removal in primary thalamic cultures on the expression of the nine genes identified by gene profiling. the cultures contained both neurons and glia , which is vital for the survival of thalamic neurons  <cit> .

thalamic neurons cultured in vitro maintain the nuclear localization of β-catenin  <cit> . to decrease its level, the cultures were treated with an adenovirus that carried axin <dig>  the product of which is a component of the β-catenin destruction complex and as such should reduce its cytoplasmic and nuclear pool. the control cultures were transduced with gfp-expressing adenovirus. the percentage of β-catenin-positive neurons decreased from ~40% to 10% in cultures with ectopic axin <dig> expression . no nuclear β-catenin was detected in glia.

afterward, the expression levels of the nine genes and control genes, map <dig>  cacna1h, and lef <dig>  were measured by rt-qpcr. similar expression levels of the neuronal marker map <dig> in gfp- and axin2- expressing cultures verified the equal survival and condition of neurons . the level of lef <dig>  serving as a positive control as a classical target of β-catenin, decreased by ~20%, confirming the impairment of β-catenin-dependent transcription in the treated cultures. the expression level of cacna1h, a paralog of cacna1g that lacks conserved lef1/tcf motifs, was not modified. of the nine examined genes, we observed a statistically significant decrease in the expression of six genes, cacna1g, cacna2d <dig>  kcna <dig>  kcnh <dig>  gabra <dig>  and calb <dig>  suggesting that these genes are authentic targets of β-catenin. the level of glra <dig> expression increased, and grid <dig> expression did not change. drd <dig> transcription was not detected .

the actual decreases of the expression levels in given neurons were supposedly several times larger, considering that the changes in the level of nuclear β-catenin occurred in ~30% of the cultured neurons. this percentage was estimated based on the following observations:  40% of the neurons were β-catenin-positive in the control, and  12% of the neurons still maintained the nuclear localization of β-catenin after axin <dig> adenovirus treatment . the most pronounced effects were observed for cacna1g, kcna <dig>  and calb2; together with the chip results , this indicates the high importance of β-catenin in the regulation of the expression of these genes in thalamic neurons. the chip and expression results were also consistent for gabra <dig> and corroborated the regulation of this gene by β-catenin.

discussion
the present study identified five new β-catenin target genes in thalamic neurons, in addition to previously described cacna1g <cit> . three of them, kcna <dig>  calb <dig>  and gabra <dig>  were validated by chip in vivo and a loss-of-function experiment in cultured neurons, confirming that they might be directly regulated by β-catenin. two other genes, cacna2d <dig> and kcnh <dig>  also displayed β-catenin-dependence in the latter experiment, although the binding of β-catenin to their regulatory elements was not found. based on these data, we propose that β-catenin is a regulator of the electrophysiological properties of thalamic neurons in the adult brain.

numerous genes that we selected in silico as potentially regulated by β-catenin belong to expected functional categories: transcription regulation, cell proliferation, morphogenesis, motility, adhesion, differentiation, and programmed cell death. similar clusters were observed by others in the genes bound by tcf7l <dig> in a human colorectal cancer cell line  <cit> . these results support the well-established role of wnt/β-catenin in development. interestingly, the genes involved in neuronal differentiation exhibited the highest enrichment scores in our list. this was consistent with a study that identified β-catenin-lef1/tcf targets based on a chip assay in nih3t <dig> cells. thirty percent of the target genes were implicated in developmental processes, and more than half of the targets from this group were involved in neuronal development  <cit> . indeed, wnt signaling has been particularly implicated in central nervous system development, from early brain patterning to embryonic and adult neurogenesis  <cit> .

although our in silico analysis corroborated the involvement of lef1/tcfs in the regulation of well-known groups of genes, it also identified a group that has not been previously proposed to be a β-catenin-lef1/tcf target. these were the genes of proteins involved in signal transmission in neurons, including voltage-gated ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, synaptic vesicle proteins, and synaptic structural proteins. moreover, we provided experimental evidence of the authentic regulation of some of these genes by β-catenin. the above gene clusters have not yet been identified, probably because the screenings for β-catenin target genes were performed on established cell lines or cancer cells  <cit> . additionally, studies of hippocampal neurons, in which β-catenin nuclear translocation was observed after nmda stimulation, did not attempt to identify specific neuronal targets  <cit> .

while examining the β-catenin-chromatin association and acetylation of histone h <dig>  we did not observe any relationship between these two phenomena in the analyzed regions with the lef1/tcf motif. this suggests that the interaction between the β-catenin-lef1/tcf complex and dna might not require the open conformation of chromatin. these results may also suggest that the β-catenin complex does not always increase histone acetylation, although it potentially has such an ability  <cit> . this is consistent with a recent study performed on embryonic stem cells, in which knockdown of tcf <dig> and tcf7l <dig> did not affect the active chromatin conformation of their targets  <cit> . we also noticed an interesting pattern of lef1/tcf motif occurrence in the examined genes. the motifs were usually clustered downstream of the first exon and not in the promoter regions. this suggests that the transcription of these genes may be regulated by lef1/tcf factors by gene looping, which has been demonstrated for the cox <dig> and mmp <dig> genes, in which lef1/tcf binding sites were located in the 3′ untranslated region  <cit> .

the neuronal genes with conserved lef1/tcf motifs that were highly expressed in the thalamus, the regulation of which by β-catenin was confirmed experimentally, encode proteins involved in neuronal excitability. cav <dig>  , cavα2δ <dig> , kv <dig>  , kv <dig> /elk <dig> , and gabaa receptor  <dig>  are all voltage- or ligand-gated ion channels  <cit> . as such, they underlie the cell membrane conductance of ca2+, k+, and cl-  ions and directly propagate, inhibit or modify electric signals  <cit> . calretinin, in turn, is an intracellular ca2+-binding protein  <cit>  with diverse functions, including the modulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability  <cit> . we propose that β-catenin contributes to the proper excitability of thalamic neurons by regulating the expression of the above genes. however, more research is required to determine the real impact of β-catenin and lef1/tcf factors on the expression of the identified genes and electrophysiology of the thalamus.

the other classes of putative neuronal targets of lef1/tcf  did not show high expression in the thalamus. however, they still might be regulated by β-catenin and lef1/tcf factors in some subtypes of neurons or under specific physiological conditions because the regulation of gene expression by β-catenin is very much context-dependent  <cit> . particularly interesting would be the exploration of this possibility in future research because a membranous fraction of β-catenin interacts with pdz proteins in synapses and is implicated in synaptic vesicle localization  <cit> . the role of nuclear β-catenin in the regulation of pdz and synaptic vesicle protein expression might complement the function of membranous β-catenin in neurons.

we do not yet know whether variations in the nuclear level of β-catenin affect the expression of genes that encode vgccs and neurotransmitter receptors and shape neuronal excitability in vivo. if so, then we could speculate that the inappropriate activity of β-catenin might affect proper signal transmission in thalamocortical circuits. thalamocortical desynchronization underlies absence epilepsy  <cit> , and many anticonvulsant drugs target voltage-gated channels . specifically, the t-type voltage-gated channel cav <dig>  has been proposed to be implicated in absence seizures  <cit> , in addition to the cavα2δ <dig> regulatory subunit of voltage-gated channels  <cit>  and gabaa receptor  <dig>  <cit> . schizophrenia has also been associated with thalamic dysfunction  <cit> . moreover, some variants of tcf7l <dig> have been recently shown to be a risk factor in schizophrenia  <cit> , and a group of synaptic genes involved in excitability has been found to be associated with the risk of schizophrenia  <cit> . interestingly, gabra3-deficient mice display impairments in sensorimotor gating, which is a feature of this disorder  <cit> . these results suggest a possible role for β-catenin-dependent gene expression in thalamic pathologies, but further in vivo studies are required to elucidate this issue.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified a novel group of genes regulated by β-catenin-lef1/tcf that encode proteins that underlie the transmission of nerve impulses. these results point to a novel role for β-catenin in the thalamus, in which β-catenin is constantly present in the cell nuclei. the identified and confirmed genes are directly involved in neuronal excitability, suggesting that β-catenin and lef1/tcf transcription factors maintain the proper activity of thalamocortical circuits. the presented results may implicate the involvement of β-catenin transcriptional activity in thalamic pathologies, such as absence epilepsy and schizophrenia.
