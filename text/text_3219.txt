BACKGROUND
all mature transfer rnas  molecules, from all known living organisms, contain numerous modified nucleosides at multiple positions  <cit> . although other rna species also contain modified nucleosides, they are less common than in trna, where over  <dig> modifications have been found to occur at typically ~10%, but sometimes even at as many as 25% positions  <cit> . recently, owing to the availability of complete genome sequences, there has been a remarkable progress in identification of enzymes that introduce modifications in trnas of model organisms escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae . for instance, as a part of a large-scale project, aiming at identification of the complete repertoire of rna methyltransferases  in e. coli by combination of bioinformatics and experimental analyses, we have recently identified the so far "missing" enzymes that introduce m7g <dig>  <cit>  and mnm5s2u <dig>  <cit> . in e. coli the only trna methylations, for which the corresponding enzymes  remain unknown, are those of the 2'-oh groups of ribose at positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the anticodon loop .

ribose methylation is one of the most common modifications. in e. coli it was found to be introduced at different positions of different rnas by site-specific enzymes, s-adenosyl-l-methionine -dependent mtases that belong to two structurally and phylogenetically unrelated protein superfamilies: rossmann-fold mtase   <cit>  and spout  <cit> . these superfamilies have been defined based on sequence and structural comparisons . the rfm superfamily can be exemplified by the 23s rrna:um <dig> mtase rrmj   <cit> , while the spout superfamily can be exemplified by the trna:gm <dig> mtase trmh  <cit> .

previously, we found that in s. cerevisiae methylations at positions  <dig> and  <dig> are introduced by the trm <dig> enzyme, a close homolog of rrmj and a member of the rfm superfamily  <cit> . however, apart from the rrna mtase rrmj, there are no close homologs of trm <dig> in e. coli that could carry out the corresponding reactions in trnas  <cit> , which suggests that modifications at positions  <dig> and/or  <dig> in prokaryotic and eukaryotic trnas could be carried out by analogous, i.e. unrelated proteins. to test this hypothesis, we assayed the so far functionally uncharacterized members of the spout superfamily  <cit> : yibk, last, yfhq, and ybea for their ability to exert methylation of trna at positions  <dig> and/or  <dig> 

RESULTS
preparation of the substrates and methyltransferase candidates
analysis of the trna sequences and modified nucleosides in the modomics database  <cit>  revealed the presence of 2'-o-methylated uridine  in position  <dig> of the anticodon loop in trnagln <dig>  and trnagln <dig> , and 2'-o-methylated cytidine  at the same position in trnafmet <dig> , trnafmet <dig> , trnaser <dig> , and trnatrp <dig> . on the other hand, the nucleoside in position  <dig> was found to be 2'-o-methylated in trnaleu <dig>  to 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-o-methyluridine , and in trnaleu <dig>  to cm. we selected trnaser <dig> and trnagln <dig> as representative substrates for the methylation at position  <dig>  while trnaleu <dig> was selected as a representative substrate for the methylation at position  <dig>  transcripts were generated in vitro using t7-rna polymerase .

among the cloned open reading frames without experimentally assigned functions, we selected a set of putative mtases identified as candidates for rna modification enzymes in earlier studies: yibk, last, yfhq, and ybea  <cit> . all these proteins are members of the spout superfamily of mtases  <cit> , which is characterized by the presence of a deep topological knot  <cit> . the experimental analysis of these putative trna modification enzymes in e. coli was greatly facilitated by the availability of a complete set of cloned individual genes encoding his-tagged proteins  <cit>  and the corresponding knock-out  strains  <cit> , which should lack the corresponding mtase activities and hence, contain unmethylated substrates. thus, on the one hand, total trna was extracted from the yibk, last, yfhq, and ybea k.o. strains. on the other hand, we have expressed and purified his-tagged yibk, last, yfhq, and ybea proteins. here, data is shown in detail only for yfhq, as it was the only mtase candidate, for which we were able to demonstrate the trna mtase activity using the selected substrates. sds-page analysis of the fractions containing yfhq in the presence of  <dig> % β-mercaptoethanol showed one band corresponding to approximately  <dig> kda , in agreement with the theoretical value calculated for the yfhq monomer . the immunoblot analysis using anti-his tag antibodies confirmed the presence of a his-tagged protein in the  <dig> kda band . interestingly, sds-page analysis in the lower concentration of β-mercaptoethanol  revealed an additional band of approximately  <dig> kda, suggesting the existence of a very strong dimer. it was verified by western blot analysis as containing the his <dig> protein , this suggesting that it is indeed the dimeric form of the  <dig> kda protein. gel filtration chromatography revealed that the apparent molecular mass of the native form of the yfhq protein is about  <dig> kda . thus, we conclude that yfhq exists as a strong dimer, similarly to its homologs from the spout superfamily with known structures . the results of sds-page and gel filtration analyses for yibk, last, and ybea were qualitatively similar, e.g. their molecular mass agreed with the theoretical values expected for monomers and dimers .

yfhq encodes a mtase responsible for the formation of cm/um  <dig> in the anticodon loop of trna
in order to test whether yfhq, yibk, last, or ybea could methylate the u or c nucleosides in positions  <dig> or c in position  <dig> of the anticodon loop, we incubated the purified proteins with adomet and with in vitro transcribed trnas: ctp-labelled trnaser <dig>  utp-labelled trnagln <dig>  and ctp-labelled trnaleu <dig>  combinations of every protein with every trna substrate were tested. after incubation, the trna was hydrolyzed using nuclease p <dig> and the resulting 5'-phosphate nucleosides were analyzed by two-dimensional cellulose thin layer chromatography  followed by autoradiography. the results shown in figure  <dig> demonstrate that yfhq is able to introduce cm in the in vitro transcribed trnaser <dig> and um in the in vitro transcribed trnagln <dig>  we were unable to detect the mtase activity of yibk, last, or ybea on any of these substrates , therefore they were not analyzed further.

in order to further confirm that yfhq is responsible for methylation at position  <dig>  a similar experiment was performed using utp-labelled trnaser <dig>  after incubation in the presence of adomet and purified yfhq, the trna was hydrolyzed by ribonuclease  t <dig>  which cleaves the phosphodiester bonds to generate 3'-monophosphate nucleosides but does not cut the phosphodiester bond between a 2'-o-methylated nucleoside and the 3'-adjacent nucleoside, leaving 2'-o-methylated dinucleotides. the analysis of cleavage products revealed the presence of radioactively labelled cmup , demonstrating that yfhq methylates a c nucleoside 5'-adjacent to a u. a similar experiment performed using utp-labelled trnagln <dig> revealed the formation of radioactively labelled umup . these results are perfectly consistent with the expected 2'-o-methylation at position  <dig> .

we confirmed the localization of the 2'-o-methyl group by an independent approach. utp-labelled trnaser <dig> was modified using purified yfhq and then cleaved by rnase t <dig>  the resulting oligonucleotides  were separated on a 20% polyacrylamide gel and revealed by autoradiography. the oligonucleotides were eluted from gel and cleaved with rnase t <dig>  the tlc analysis of cleavage products revealed the presence of radioactively labelled cmup  derived from a 5-nt fragment, demonstrating that yfhq methylates a c nucleoside 5'-adjacent to a u nucleoside in a given nucleotide context, encompassing position  <dig> 

to determine whether the cm32/um <dig> mtase activity was affected in the yfhq k.o. strain, cell extracts of e. coli mc <dig> and of yfhq k.o. strains were incubated with adomet and ctp-labelled in vitro transcribed trnaser <dig> or utp-labelled trnagln <dig>  after incubation, trna was hydrolyzed by nuclease p <dig> and the nucleotides were analyzed by 2d-tlc and autoradiography. the results shown in figure  <dig> revealed the absence of cm/um formation in yfhq k.o. extract. this result was complemented by transforming the yfhq k.o. strain with a plasmid carrying the yfhq gene, purifying the yfhq protein from that strain, as described in the methods section, and testing it for the mtase activity . the observed activity allows us to conclude that yfhq is essential for the cm32/um <dig> methylation.

we also found that total  trna extracted from the wild-type strain mc <dig> was not a substrate for the purified yfhq enzyme, while trna from the yfhq k.o. strain was an excellent substrate for this enzyme. the purified yfhq protein was incubated with 14c-radiolabelled adomet  and total trna extracted either from the wild type strain mc <dig>  or from the yfhq_k.o. strain . after incubation, the trna was hydrolyzed by nuclease p <dig> and the resulting nucleotides were analyzed by 2d-tlc and autoradiography. as expected, the result shown in figure  <dig> revealed the formation of a radioactive compound with migration characteristic for cm only in the case of trna from the yfhq k.o. strain, but not in the case of the fully modified trna. this suggests that in e. coli yfhq is the only mtase responsible for the formation of cm <dig> in trna. curiously, no um was detected in this last experiment. the cause could be that trnas that normally contain um <dig> are much less abundant than trnas containing cm <dig>  however, the possibility that another mtase can also form um <dig> cannot be totally excluded. in accordance with the recently proposed, uniform nomenclature for rna modification enzymes  <cit>  we suggest to rename yfhq as trmet. alternatively, according to the traditional nomenclature for bacterial trna mtases, it could be named trmj.

sequence analysis and modeling of yfhq reveals a conserved active site common to ribose 2'-o-mtases from the spout superfamily and underscores the convergent evolution with the rfm superfamily
yfhq was previously reported to belong to the spout superfamily of mtases  <cit> , although at that time no structural information was available for any of these proteins to guide the identification of the active site. only recently, a number of spout structures were solved, providing templates for homology modeling of other members. we carried out the protein fold-recognition analysis for the yfhq sequence using the genesilico meta-server  <cit>  to predict its structure. we found, as expected, that the structures of spout superfamily members were identified as the only compatible templates for yfhq, with genuine ribose mtases rlmb  <cit> , trmh  <cit> , and avirb  <cit> , as well as putative mtases rrma  <cit>  and yibk  <cit>  reported with highest scores . we constructed a homology model of yfhq using the "frankenstein monster's approach"  <cit> . comparison of the model with the templates  reveals the common "knotted" structure of the adomet-binding site and conservation of the residues demonstrated to be involved in catalysis in trmh  <cit> . this suggests that trna mtases trmh and yfhq use a very similar mechanism for methylation of ribose in different positions,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the same active site is also conserved in yibk, which we found not to methylate trna and which we predict to be involved in modification of one  of the "unassigned" ribose methylations in rrna  <cit> . we predict that the trna-binding activity and substrate specificity of yfhq is at least in part dependent on the presence of the c-terminal extension, which is absent from other members of this family  or replaced by different domains or extensions implicated in rna-binding .

the statistical significance of sequence conservation between yfhq and previously characterized spout mtases of known structure  practically guarantees that their structures are very similar. experimental support for this prediction is obtained from the circular dichroim  analysis , which reveals that the secondary structure content of yfhq  is similar to the prediction reported here, taking into account the helical structure of the unmodeled c-terminal region. these values are also comparable to the secondary structure observed in the crystal structure of a bona fide spout member yibk and our measurements of cd spectra carried out for yibk .

CONCLUSIONS
our results reveal that methylation at position  <dig> in the anticodon loop of bacterial and eukaryotic trnas is carried out by completely unrelated enzymes: a spout superfamily member yfhq and rfm superfamily member trm <dig>  this scenario is strikingly similar to the one observed in the case of m1g <dig> modification, which is carried out by the spout superfamily member trmd in bacteria and by the rfm superfamily member trm <dig> in eukaryota and archaea  <cit> . on the other hand, methylation of ribose at position  <dig> is carried out by members of the spout superfamily both in prokaryota and eukaryota: trmh  <cit> , and trm <dig>  <cit> , respectively, while the n1-methylation of adenosine a <dig>  is catalyzed by members of the rfm superfamily  <cit> . it is unclear which of these two mtase superfamilies was more ancient and how they replaced each other for the methylation of different positions in trnas from different phylogenetic lineages. among the four members of the spout superfamily studied in this work  we were unable to identify the mtase specific for the position  <dig> in e. coli trnas. it remains to be determined if this last missing trna mtase is present among the remaining, so far uncharacterized members of spout and rfm superfamilies  <cit>  and whether it uses a known active site or invented a new one for the same reaction. definitely, more work is needed to elucidate the complicated pathways of evolution of rna modification systems in all domains of life.
