BACKGROUND
chilling, a type of low temperature stress, is a common abiotic environmental stress that seriously affects the growth and development of plants  <cit> . chilling stress has attracted increasing attention. to date, many studies about plant morphological and physiological responses to chilling stress have been reported  <cit> . in addition, genes related to the chilling response have been identified, such as genes encoding the transcription factors dreb/cbf  <cit> , wrky  <cit> , myb  <cit>  and so on.

in recent years, micrornas  have become a research hotspot . mirnas are a distinct class of tiny noncoding rnas approximately  <dig> nucleotides  in length  <cit> . the rnas participate in regulating gene expression at the posttranscriptional level in both plants and animals  <cit> . prior to their regulation of gene expression, mirnas are generated from hairpin precursors by dicer-like  into mirna::mirna* duplexes  <cit> . the mirna* strand is then degraded, the mature mirna joins with argonaute  and the rna-induced silencing complex  is generated. finally, the silencing complex targets protein-coding mrnas by cleaving the mrnas at specific positions or by repressing translation  <cit> .

since the discovery of mirna genes in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans 20 years ago  <cit> , mirnas have been intensively studied. notably, in recent years, new generation sequencing technology has led to the identification of numerous mirnas, especially novel and low copy number mirnas, in many plant species, such as wild soybean  <cit> , rape  <cit> , radish  <cit> , medicago truncatula
 <cit>  and so on. in addition, the interaction between mirnas and target genes has received much attention. degradome sequencing is an emerging technology used to predict and verify target genes of mirnas. compared with traditional methods, i.e., bioinformatics prediction and 5’ race, degradome sequencing is rapid and effective  <cit> . with the utilization of the two high-sequencing approaches, numerous mirnas have been identified, and great progress has been made in elucidating the interaction between mirnas and target genes, especially chilling stress-related mirnas. for example, many chilling-responsive mirnas have been detected in arabidopsis
 <cit> , brachypodium
 <cit> , prunus persica
 <cit> , populus tomentosa
 <cit> , oryza sativa
 <cit>  and zea may
 <cit> . studies of the functions of mirnas have been carried out simultaneously.

tomato is a globally important vegetable of the solanum family  <cit> . although tomato is widely grown in various temperature zones, its growth and development are rather sensitive to temperature stress, including extreme chilling stress  <cit> . however, most cultivated and commercial tomato cultivars are considered to be sensitive to chilling stress  <cit> .

with the completion of the tomato genome sequence  <cit> , tomato has become a model system for research on the interaction between mirnas and their target genes. although many tomato mirnas have been identified by traditional sanger cloning, deep sequencing and bioinformatics approach , chilling-responsive mirnas in tomato have not been reported.

‘la1777’  is one kind of wild tomato. and it exhibits higher chilling-tolerance ability than other cultivars in our previous research, which is in agreement with other studies  <cit> . in this study, using ‘la1777’, two small rna libraries from leaves treated with and without chilling stress  were constructed for high-throughput solexa sequencing. then  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were obtained from the two libraries, respectively. the results showed that small rnas   <dig> and 24 nt in length were the most abundant classes. a total of  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified in the two libraries. based on the abundance of mirnas, the expression amounts between the two libraries were compared,  <dig> increased and  <dig> decreased mirnas were detected in the chilling stress. in addition, degradome sequencing analysis was adopted to identify target genes of the mirnas. it was found that  <dig> target genes were cleaved by  <dig> conserved mirnas and nine target genes were cleaved by nine novel mirnas. the verification of nine mirnas and six target genes by quantitative real-time pcr  basically confirmed the sequencing results. target gene functional analysis showed most target genes were involved in the defense response through regulating the expression of anti-stress proteins, antioxidant enzyme and genes involved in cell wall formation. in addition to identify chilling-responsive conserved and novel mirnas in tomato, the work lays the foundation for further elucidating the regulation of mirnas in response to chilling stress.

RESULTS
analysis of small rna data from the libraries
to identify mirnas from tomato that respond to chilling stress, two small rna libraries from tomato leaves treated with and without chilling stress were constructed and sequenced using an illumina genome analyzer ii . a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were generated from the chilling-treated  library and non-chilling-treated  library, respectively . after removing 3’ and 5’ adaptors, sequences with <15 nt and >29 nt and junk reads, the remaining reads were searched against the rfam , repeat databases  and tomato genome sequence ;  <dig> % and  <dig> %  of total srnas in the ct and nt library were filtered out, respectively. finally,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads corresponding to  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> unique reads were obtained from the two libraries, respectively. the number and percentage of various srnas were listed in table  <dig> table  <dig>

identification of conserved mirnas from tomato
to detect conserved mirnas from the two tomato libraries, all clean reads were aligned against mature plant mirnas and the precursors in mirbase  <dig>  , allowing for a maximum of one mismatch in the first 16 nt of the mirna and three mismatches in total between the target mirnas and the known mirnas. finally,  <dig> conserved mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families were identified in the two libraries . interestingly, the number of mirnas varied among families . the largest family was the  <dig> mirna family with  <dig> members, including two members only identified in the nt library and the remaining  <dig> ones presented in both two libraries, followed by the  <dig> mirna family, while the  <dig> and  <dig> mirna families were the smallest, each containing only one mirna member. in addition, the member of the  <dig> mirna family and one member of  <dig> mirna family were exclusively detected in the ct library. among these,  <dig> mirnas designated as p <dig> or p <dig> were identified for the first time in tomato, which comprised new flanking sequences or other sequences of known mirnas deposited in mirbase  <dig> .figure  <dig>

in the ct and nt libraries, there were  <dig> mirnas in common, while two mirnas that were sha-mir169c-3p_stu and sha-mir408a-5p_stu were only found in the ct library; six mirnas that were sha-mir156e-p3_stu, sha-mir156f-p5_stu, sha-mir162-p5_cme, sha-mir166g-p5_nta, sha-mir167-p <dig> and sha-mir171h-p5_vvi were specific to the nt library . on the other hand, the frequency of mirnas in the two libraries can be regarded as an index for estimating the expression amounts of mirnas. therefore, after sequencing, raw reads obtained by sequencing were normalized for the chi-square test, the fisher-exact test and log <dig> ratio determination between the ct and nt libraries. the result of this comparison showed that  <dig> mirna members increased in response to chilling stress with log <dig>  >  <dig>  whereas  <dig> members decreased with log <dig>  <  <dig>  only mirnas with significant expression amounts  of both <  <dig>  and | log <dig>  | ≥  <dig> were considered to be significantly regulated. among these mirnas,  <dig> mirnas that were sha-mir166a-p <dig>  sha-mir <dig>  sha-mir397_nta, sha-mir397-p <dig>  sha-mir398a-3p_stu, sha-mir398a-5p_stu, sha-mir398a-p3_cme, sha-mir399-p <dig>  sha-mir408_nta, sha-mir408a-3p_stu, sha-mir408b-5p_stu and sha-mir530a_cme significantly increased in response to chilling stress, while  <dig> mirnas significantly decreased . of the  <dig> newly identified mirnas, most had lower expression amounts with norm read < <dig>  possibly because the new flanking sequences or other mirna sequences were theoretically more volatile than the others  <cit> .figure  <dig>

identification of novel mirnas from tomato
to identify potentially novel mirnas from tomato, after filtering out the conserved mirnas, sequences ranging from  <dig> to 24 nt were used to further analysis using strict criteria for mirna prediction. second structures of the pre-mirnas were predicted by unafold software   <cit> ; only those with stable hairpin structures were considered. the minimal folding free index  was an important feature used to distinguish mirnas from other noncoding rnas  <cit> . in this study, mirnas with mefis exceeding  <dig>  were regarded as candidate mirnas. ultimately,  <dig> novel mirnas corresponding to  <dig> unique sequences generated from  <dig> precursors were discovered from tomato in the two libraries .

as shown in a venn diagram,  <dig> novel mirnas were shared in both libraries;  <dig> novel mirnas were unique to the nt library, while seven novel mirnas were only identified in the ct library . meanwhile, the expression amounts of the mirnas between the two libraries were compared. of the mirnas identified,  <dig> mirnas increased in response to chilling stress, while  <dig> mirnas decreased. moreover,  <dig> mirnas significantly increased, while six mirnas significantly decreased . on the other hand, compared with the conserved mirnas, most of the novel mirnas had low expression amounts with norm read < <dig>  which was consistent with previous reports in arabidopsis
 <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . however, several mirnas, such as pc-58-3p and pc-58-5p, were present at high amounts with norm read >  <dig> , which was different from previous results.

identification of conserved mirnas targets in tomato
to understand the function of the mirnas, high-throughput degradome sequencing, a new technology  <cit> , was utilized to identify the mirnas targets. in this study,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> raw reads corresponding to  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> unique reads were initially obtained in the ct and nt library, respectively . following blast analysis,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the reads could be mapped to mrna , respectively.table  <dig> 
summary of degradome library data




for data analysis, cleaveland <dig>  software was used to detect the cleavage products guided by mirnas. according to the sequencing result, the abundance of sequenced tags was plotted on every transcript, and the cleaved target transcripts were classified into five categories, namely, category  <dig>  category  <dig>  category  <dig>  category  <dig> and category  <dig>  for the conserved mirnas,  <dig> sequences of  <dig> target genes from  <dig> conserved mirnas were identified out of  <dig> conserved mirnas . however, the targets of most mirnas were not identified, perhaps because the abundance of cleavage products was too low to be detected or because the interaction between mirnas and the targets did not involve cleaving.

of these sequences,  <dig> sequences of target genes were shared between the two libraries, including  <dig> decreased,  <dig> increased and two constant sequences, while  <dig> sequences were only identified in the ct library and  <dig> were only found in the nt library. in the ct library,  <dig> sequences for conserved mirnas were identified. the abundance ranged from eight to  <dig>  tags per billion. of these sequences,  <dig> belonged in category  <dig>  while  <dig> sequences of conserved mirnas were in category 1;  <dig> sequences were in category 2; two were in category  <dig> and  <dig> were in category  <dig>  by contrast,  <dig> sequences of mirnas were identified in the nt library with abundance ranging from nine to  <dig>  tags per billion. of these, the most abundant category was category  <dig> including  <dig> sequences. additionally, eight,  <dig> and  <dig> sequences of conserved mirnas were grouped into category  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . all of the identified target plots  were shown in additional file 6: figure s <dig> and additional file 7: figure s <dig>  sequenced tags of targets between the two libraries were compared, and the result showed that there were more specific targets detected in the ct library than in the nt library. the result suggested that chilling stress might cause the cleavage of mirna targets, leading to the accumulation of cleaved fragments.

among the identified targets, more target genes were predicted to be cleaved by one mirna. for example, tcp <dig>  tcp <dig> and trpb <dig> were targeted by sha-mir319b_stu. on the other hand, one target was usually cleaved by more than one mirnas. for example, spl <dig> was predicted to be cleaved by sha-mir156a, sha-mir156c, sha-mir156c_nta, sha-mir156d_nta, sha-mir156e_stu, sha-mir156g_stu, sha-mir156h_stu, sha-mir156i_stu and sha-mir156j_stu. by contrast, only one target was found for sha-mir156d_nta and sha-mir393-5p_stu. interestingly, several targets were cleaved by pairs of mirnas, such as sha-mir396b_nta and sha-mir396c_nta, both of which targeted cyspl, rd21a, drm <dig>  cpr <dig>  cyp <dig> and drm <dig>  which suggested that the two mirnas might cooperate to regulate gene expression .

to understand more about the roles of mirnas in the response to chilling stress, gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway analysis were performed. go analysis showed that the targets were associated with various functions . go enrichment analysis showed that the target genes of differentially expressed conserved mirnas were mainly involved in metal ion binding, cytoplasm and superoxide dismutase activity. however, fewer functions were found using kegg analysis . gene functional analysis showed that sha-mir398_nta targeted  <dig> sequences of cu/zn superoxide dismutase  gene, including  <dig> found in both libraries. the result suggested that the  <dig> sequences were not key regulators of the chilling response, while the remaining  <dig> sequences might play important roles in the stress response. additionally, transcription factors and stress-responsive proteins were also targeted by mirnas. for example, scarecrow-like protein, ribosomal protein and tcp family transcription factors targeted by sha-mir <dig> , sha-mir156i-p3_nta and sha-mir319b_stu, respectively, were mainly found in the ct library, which suggested that these mirnas might play important roles in the chilling stress response, which was in agreement with the results reported in rice  <cit> . on the other hand, sha-mir <dig>  directly targeted low-temperature-induced proteins that might play positive roles in the chilling response, and sha-mir160a and sha-mir167b_nta might participate in the stress response by targeting an auxin response factor gene.

identification of novel mirnas targets in tomato
like the conserved mirnas, the targets of most novel mirnas were not identified; out of the  <dig> novel mirnas identified, only  <dig> sequences of nine genes were predicted for nine novel mirnas . among these target sequences,  <dig> were identified in both libraries, including  <dig> decreased and five increased, while  <dig> were only found in the ct library and three were unique to the nt library. the abundance of the sequenced tags was plotted for every transcript ; the transcripts were distributed into four categories. unlike the targets of conserved mirnas, most tags of novel mirnas were grouped into category  <dig>  in the ct library,  <dig> sequences with abundance ranging from eight to  <dig>  tags per billion were detected. of these  <dig> sequences,  <dig> were in category 2;  <dig> were in category 0; five were in category  <dig> and only one was in category  <dig>  by contrast,  <dig> sequences with abundance ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  tags per billion were found in the nt library. there were five, two and  <dig> sequences in category  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.table  <dig> 
functional description of target genes cleaved by novel mirnas from the ct and nt libraries




unlike the conserved mirnas, more target tags of the novel mirnas were detected in the nt library, which suggested that under chilling stress, cleaving might not be the main mode of action between novel mirnas and target genes. perhaps eliciting mrna degradation or arresting mrna translation played a dominant role in this interaction. go enrichment analysis showed that integral to membrane, cellulose biosynthetic process and cellular cell wall organization were the main functions of the target genes cleaved by the differentially expressed novel mirnas .

compared with the targets of conserved mirnas, target gene description showed that the target genes of novel mirnas were with special functions . receptor-like protein kinase is regarded as the sensor or transducer of stress signals. a receptor-like protein kinase gene targeted by pc-58-5p was identified in the current study. the gene encoding xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases  targeted by pc-125-3p was detected, and the tag sequences were only detected in the nt library. in addition, pc-102-5p, targeting a cellulose synthase  subunit gene, was detected in the two libraries. and the inositol-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase-like  gene, which plays a role in the reaction between atp and adp and is targeted by pc-146-5p, was also identified.

qrt-pcr verification
to examine the mirnas expression amounts and verify the sequencing result, nine mirnas including six conserved mirnas and three novel mirnas were selected for further analysis. following previous studies  <cit> , poly -tailed qrt-pcr was utilized to analyze the temporal and spatial expression patterns of these mirnas in tomato. for further verification and confirmation, another chilling-tolerant tomato cultivar, ‘hezuo908’, was subjected to the same treatment as the tomato cultivar ‘la1777’. quantitative analysis showed that compared with the expression amounts of mirnas in the nt libraries, the expression amounts of the nine mirnas varied in the ct libraries of both cultivars . at 1 h of treatment, the expression amounts of sha-mir156a, sha-mir482b and pc-69-5p were significantly higher in both ct libraries than that in the nt libraries, followed by a marked decrease and then gradually increased. the expression amounts of sha-mir6023-p <dig> and sha-mir <dig> were also significantly higher in both ct libraries at 1 h and then obviously decreased at 12 h. at 4 h, the expression amounts of sha-mir160a, sha-mir398_nta and pc-46-5p were significantly higher in both ct libraries than that in the nt libraries and then decreased, while the expression amounts of pc-170-5p were significantly higher in the ct libraries at 8 h.meanwhile, the expression amounts of six target genes cleaved by sha-mir160a, sha-mir398_nta, sha-mir482b, sha-mir <dig> and pc-46-5p were also verified by qrt-pcr. as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression amounts of target genes cleaved by sha-mir160a and pc-46-5p were both significantly lower in the ct libraries, followed by an increase, and they were significantly higher in the ct libraries at 48 h. the expression amounts of the target genes cleaved by sha-mir398_nta and sha-mir <dig> exhibited the same trend, while they were significantly higher in the ct libraries and peaked at 24 h and 12 h, respectively. at 1 h, the expression amounts of target genes of sha-mir482b were significantly lower in ct libraries, followed by an increase and peaked at 24 h. the results were basically identical to the sequencing data.figure  <dig>

network analysis
a total of  <dig> genes targeted by  <dig> mirnas were detected in response to chilling stress. the network between mirnas and target genes was elucidated according to go analysis . as shown in the network, the increased sha-mir <dig> , sha-mir171b-3p_stu, sha-mir319b_stu, sha-mir <dig> , sha-mir398_nta and pc-102-5p played important regulatory roles in the network by regulating the expression of genes encoding anti-stress proteins , antioxidant enzyme  and cellulose synthesis , while the decreased sha-mir160a, sha-mir167b_nta, sha-mir <dig> , sha-mir171a, sha-mir171a_nta, sha-mir171c_mtr, sha-mir171d, pc-58-5p, pc-146-5p and pc-125-3p were involved in signal transduction and cell wall formation, as well as regulation of genes encoding anti-stress proteins . of the target genes examined, spl, scl, tcp, sodc <dig>  cesa <dig>  auxin response factors genes , iku <dig>  ippk and xth <dig> might be the most important genes in the entire network.figure  <dig>

discussion
mirnas, a class of noncoding small rnas, are important regulators involved in plant growth, development and stress responses that have received increasing amounts of attention . in recent years, a new approach for discovering mirnas, high-throughput sequencing technology, has been widely used to identify conserved and novel mirnas in plants, which has enlarged the realm of mirna research and made mirna a hotspot of epigenetic research. abiotic stress, a common stress that seriously affects plant production, has also received increasing attention. the mirna regulation theory and the utilization of high-throughput sequencing have opened up a new area of abiotic stress research. in recent years, great progress has been made in understanding the role of mirnas in the response to various environmental stresses, such as drought  <cit> , salt  <cit>  and waterlogging stresses  <cit> . chilling is a common abiotic stress that seriously affects normal plant growth, development, yield and quality. plant mirnas involved in chilling response have been increasingly studied during the past few years. however, to our knowledge, few such studies have been reported in tomato.

tomato is an important vegetable crop that is grown worldwide  <cit> . chilling is a common abiotic stress that affects tomato cultivation, especially in the greenhouse during the cooler seasons  <cit> . in china, solar greenhouses are the principal systems employed for tomato cultivation in the spring and winter, when chilling stress is common  <cit> . since mirnas are thought to be important for the abiotic stress response and a high-through sequencing approach is available, research on chilling-responsive mirnas in tomato will help to reveal the response mechanisms of the mirnas and to further elucidate the mechanism of mirna regulation in general. more importantly, the study provides a theoretical foundation for breeding chilling-tolerant tomato cultivars and for further research on mirna regulation of the response to chilling stress.

conserved and novel mirnas in tomato
to identify chilling-responsive mirnas from tomato, two small rna libraries from tomato seedlings treated with and without chilling stress were constructed. a high-through sequencing approach was utilized to identify conserved and novel mirnas;  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were obtained by high-throughput sequencing of the two libraries, respectively. following filtering, a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families were identified . unexpectedly,  <dig> new flanking sequences noted as p <dig> or p <dig> were discovered . in mirbase  <dig> , there were  <dig> precursors and  <dig> mature mirna sequences from tomato. in this study,  <dig> conserved mirna sequences generated from  <dig> precursors were identified. all conserved mirnas were divided into  <dig> mirna families, and several mirna families were the first to be detected in tomato, such as mir <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  although mir <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were deposited in mirbase, they were not detected in the current study, perhaps because these mirnas have specific expression patterns. additionally, compared with the mirnas deposited in mirbase, many of the conserved mirnas identified in the current study were also detected in other members of the solanaceae family, such as potato and tobacco, which suggested that these mirnas were conserved in solanaceae. therefore, there was more vast development space for tomato mirnas.

additionally,  <dig> novel mirnas generated from  <dig> precursors were identified . in contrast to conserved mirnas, most novel mirnas exhibited low expression amounts with norm read < <dig>  which was previously reported in arabidopsis
 <cit> , wheat  <cit>  and grapevine  <cit> . however, several novel mirnas exhibited moderate or high expression amounts with norm read >  <dig> . in the current study, a total of  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel mirnas were firstly discovered to be associated with the tomato chilling response.

differentially expressed mirnas in tomato
the abundance of mirnas can be regarded as an index for estimating the expression amounts of mirnas. therefore, to identify chilling-responsive mirnas, the expression amounts of mirnas between the two libraries were compared. in total,  <dig> increased and  <dig> decreased mirnas were differentially expressed between the two libraries. and the mirnas were expected to play key roles in the chilling response. it is worth to noting that  <dig> mirnas were significantly regulated by chilling stress . of these,  <dig> mirnas including  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel mirnas significantly increased in the response to chilling stress, while  <dig> mirnas including  <dig> conserved and six novel mirnas significantly decreased. in short, more mirnas were cold-suppressed mirnas, which was in agreement with previous research on brachypodium
 <cit> .

of the mirnas with significantly altered expression, several chilling-responsive mirnas were conserved among several plant species. mir <dig> was induced by chilling stress in brachypodium, populus tomentosa and arabidopsis
 <cit> . mir <dig> was induced by chilling stress in arabidopsis
 <cit> . in the current study, sha-mir <dig> and sha-mir <dig>  were both found to be induced by chilling stress, which indicated that some mirnas involved in chilling stress showed consistency among several plant species. additionally, some mirnas, such as mir <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  increased under the chilling stress in arabidopsis
 <cit>  and brachypodium
 <cit> , but in this study, no obvious change in expression was detected. on the other hand, several previously reported chilling-responsive mirnas, such as mir <dig> in arabidopsis
 <cit> , were not detected in the current study, which suggested that these mirnas might be species-specific and their expression was not specifically altered in tomato, or perhaps the altered expression of these mirnas did not occur during the duration of the study.to confirm and verify the sequencing result, nine mirnas, including conserved sha-mir156a, sha-mir160a, sha-mir398_nta, sha-mir482b, sha-mir6023-p <dig> and sha-mir <dig> and the novel pc-46-5p, pc-69-5p and pc-170-5p, were chosen for qrt-pcr verification in the sequenced tomato cultivar ‘la1777’. as shown in figure  <dig>  the results of verification were consistent with the sequencing results. for further confirmation, the expression of these mirnas was also examined in another more chilling-tolerant tomato cultivar, ‘hezuo908’. the results showed a similar trend in the two tomato cultivars, while the range of altered expression differed among cultivars. the result suggested that there was a consistent relationship between the mirna sequences of the two tomato cultivars. however, the extent of the responses differed between the cultivars under chilling stress, perhaps due to differences in the levels of chilling tolerance.

target genes of tomato mirnas
to study the function of mirnas in the chilling stress response, the two libraries were also used to degradome sequencing. as expected, many predicted targets for conserved mirnas were identified, including those that function in various biological processes . for example, spl, ap <dig> and mads-box, which were targeted by sha-mir <dig> , sha-mir <dig>  and sha-mir396a_nta, respectively, participated in plant development. in addition, genes involved in regulating the plant response to chilling stress were also identified. for example, most genes encoding anti-stress proteins  targeted by sha-mir171a_nta, sha-mir171b-3p_stu, sha-mir171c_mtr and sha-mir156i-p3_nta were only detected in the ct library, which was in agreement with previous results from arabidopsis
 <cit> . moreover, the cu/zn superoxide dismutase-encoding gene cleaved by increased sha-mir398_nta was also mainly detected in the ct library, which suggested that sha-mir398_nta and the gene played an important role in the chilling response, which was also in agreement with previous studies of arabidopsis
 <cit> 
. in the current study, auxin response factors genes were cleaved by decreased sha-mir160a and sha-mir167b_nta and more tag sequences were mainly detected in the nt library, while only mir167-targeted auxin response factors genes were identified in the chilling response in rice  <cit> . the results suggested that among different plant species, conserved mirnas might share similar functions by targeting homologous genes in the chilling stress response. additionally, most of the conserved mirna targets were classified as category  <dig> , containing a cleavage site in only one position, further confirming the accuracy of the degradome sequencing result.

targets of novel mirnas were also examined . compared with conserved mirnas, only nine target genes of nine novel mirnas were identified. go annotation showed that some specific targets cleaved only by novel mirnas were identified. receptor-like protein kinases play important roles in defense responses. when plants suffer from abiotic stress, receptor-like kinases may be the first sensor or transducer of stress signals. moreover, several related genes encoding receptor-like protein induced by chilling stress have been reported in rice  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and arabidopsis thaliana
 <cit> . in the current study, a receptor-like protein kinase gene targeted by pc-58-5p was also identified, which suggested that pc-58-5p was an important regulator of the chilling response. a cellulose synthase subunit gene targeted by pc-102-5p was detected in the research; this gene played an important role in cellulose synthesis  <cit>  and cell wall formation  <cit> . in addition, cellulose synthase was involved in the low temperature stress response by affecting fiber quality, cell wall formation and cell wall loosening  <cit> . perhaps the cellulose synthase subunit gene played an essential role in the low temperature response. in addition, pc-125-3p targeted a gene encoding xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases, which regulated another major component of the plant cell wall. several related genes in arabidopsis and rice played a role in the cold stress response  <cit> . interestingly, pc-146-5p targeted the inositol-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase-like gene, encoding an enzyme that catalyzed the chemical reaction between the atp and adp  <cit> . perhaps this enzyme participated in the stress response by controlling the energy supply.

in the ct library,  <dig> target tags were cleaved by  <dig> mirnas with the abundance of the target tags ranging from eight to  <dig>  tags per billion, while  <dig> target tags were cleaved by  <dig> mirnas in the nt library with an abundance ranging from nine to  <dig>  tags per billion. of these,  <dig> and  <dig> target tags which were cleaved by  <dig> conserved and four novel mirnas respectively increased in the stress, while  <dig> and  <dig> target tags which were cleaved by  <dig> conserved and five novel mirnas respectively decreased. combined with the mirna expression analysis, the result showed that the abundance of the target tags was basically consistent with the mirna expression amount. on the other hand, the expression amounts of six target genes cleaved by sha-mir160a, sha-mir398_nta, sha-mir482b, sha-mir <dig> and pc-46-5p were also verified by qrt-pcr. compared with the expression amounts of these mirnas, it was found that the decline in expression of target genes was basically accompanied by an increase in mirnas expression amounts, which suggested that the tomato mirnas positively regulated their target genes, which were involved in the chilling response.

surprisingly, several low temperature-induced transcription factor genes, such as genes encoding dreb/cbf, wrky and myb were not detected in the current study, perhaps because these genes were not expressed at the time of sampling or in the leaves.

network analysis
by elucidating the network between mirnas and their target genes , the increased sha-mir <dig> , sha-mir171b-3p_stu, sha-mir319b_stu, sha-mir <dig>  and sha-mir398_nta targeted genes with various functions, which suggested that these mirnas played important regulatory roles in the tomato chilling response network. the corresponding target genes, including spl, scl, tcp, drm <dig> and sodc <dig>  played important roles in regulating plant development, gene expression and ros inactivation. the decreased sha-mir160a, sha-mir167b_nta, sha-mir <dig> , sha-mir171a, sha-mir171a_nta, sha-mir171c_mtr and sha-mir171d targeted genes that function in signal transduction, regulation of the expression of mirnas and genes encoding anti-stress proteins. of the novel mirnas, pc-102-5p increased in the stress, which played an important role in cellulose synthesis. while pc-58-5p, pc-125-3p and pc-146-5p all decreased in the stress, and their target genes were involved in signal perception, cell wall formation and energy supply. therefore, these mirnas might be involved in the chilling response by inhibiting plant development, cell wall formation and genes expression, as well as improving signal perception, energy supply and regulating mirna expression.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, in the present study, using high-throughput sequencing, hundreds of chilling-responsive mirnas were identified in tomato. the information fills the gaps in the knowledge of tomato chilling-responsive mirnas and increases the knowledge of the response of mirnas to stress. additionally, many target genes of mirnas were identified by degradome sequencing. the result showed that the target genes were involved in various functions. notably, most target genes of differentially expressed mirnas actively respond to chilling stress by regulating the expression of anti-stress proteins, antioxidant enzyme and genes involved in cell wall formation. the findings lay the foundation for exploring the role of the regulation of mirnas in the plant response to chilling stress.
