BACKGROUND
the genus burkholderia contains over  <dig> species, which occupy diverse niches and are found in a range of environmental habitats, including soil and water, and even in the hospital setting. burkholderia organisms act as pathogens, endophytes, and symbionts  <cit> . although many members of the genus are plant pathogens and soil bacteria, the most comprehensive characterizations of burkholderia species have been conducted on those organisms that are opportunistic human pathogens  <cit> . one of two major human-infectious burkholderia groups comprises b. mallei and b. pseudomallei, the causative agents of glanders and melioidosis, respectively. the other major group of burkholderia human pathogens is b. cepacia complex bacteria, which are associated with severe infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis. recently, increasing numbers of burkholderia species have been reported as plant-associated bacteria.

burkholderia species can be free-living in the plant rhizosphere, or can reside within plants as endophytes or symbionts. some burkholderia strains are known to aid plants by enhancing disease resistance, improving nitrogen fixation, and enabling adaption to environmental stresses  <cit> . however, there is little information regarding plant-pathogenic  burkholderia species, with the exception of b. glumae. b. glumae causes grain rot in rice, and is used as a model system of quorum sensing  mechanisms in gram-negative phytopathogenic bacteria  <cit> . two other important phytopathogenic burkholderia species, b. gladioli and b. plantarii, are pathogenic to rice and are primarily responsible for sheath rot and seedling blight, respectively  <cit> . under the right environmental conditions, these three pathogenic burkholderia species can cause severe damage to rice crops in various developmental stages.

in addition to occupying remarkably diverse niches, the genomes of burkholderia species range greatly in size, from ~ <dig>  to  <dig>  mbp. among burkholderia organisms, b. rhizoxinica  harbors the smallest genome , and the soil bacterium b. terrae has the largest genome . the first burkholderia rice pathogen to have its complete genome sequenced was b. glumae bgr <dig>  <cit> , and the genome of b. gladioli bsr <dig> was subsequently sequenced  <cit> . the genomes of b. glumae and b. gladioli both consist of two chromosomes and four plasmids, with genome sizes of  <dig>  mbp and  <dig>  mbp, respectively. recently, comparative genome analysis of two b. glumae strains from different geographic regions showed high degree of genomic variation  <cit>  and genetic differences between b. glumae and b. gladioli were investigated by comparative analysis of their complete genomes, along with four draft genomes from these two species  <cit> . these differences can lead to identification of specific virulence factors among strains.

in the present study, we sequenced the genome of the rice-pathogenic b. plantarii atcc 43733t strain in order to compare its genome organization with that of b. glumae bgr <dig> and b. gladioli bsr <dig>  and identify common and unique genes amongst these three burkholderia rice pathogens. in addition, we compared the genome of these burkholderia rice pathogens with the complete or draft genomes of other burkholderia species, such as those found in different environmental habitats and those that are known to be pathogenic to animals and humans. our comparative genome analysis demonstrates close relationships between the three rice pathogens and rice resulting in unique features of rice pathogenic burkholderia species relative to other animal and human burkholderia species.

RESULTS
genome sequencing and comparison
for comparative genome investigations of rice-pathogenic burkholderia strains causing grain rot, sheath rot, or seedling blight, we examined the complete genome sequences from strains of b. glumae  <cit> , b. gladioli  <cit> , and b. plantarii , along with publicly available complete or draft genomes from nine other burkholderia strains . the genomes ranged  <dig> – <dig>  mbp in size, with a g + c content of  <dig> – <dig> %, and the number of predicted coded proteins was in the range of 4300– <dig>  among the seven burkholderia strains, the genome sizes were highly variable among and within species, although the g + c contents were very similar . in the case of b. glumae, strain au <dig>  harbored the smallest genome of ~ <dig>  mbp, whereas strain bgr <dig> harbored the largest genome of ~ <dig>  mbp. b. glumae, strain au <dig> was originally isolated from an infant patient with granulomatous disease and was pathogenic to rice. these findings suggest that b. glumae has evolved substantially, or has undergone rapid genome rearrangements or deletions, under different environments and hosts.table  <dig>

to better understand the interactions between rice-pathogenic burkholderia species, comparative analysis was performed among the complete genome sequences of b. glumae bgr <dig>  b. gladioli bsr <dig>  and b. plantarii atcc 43733t . based on the illumina hiseq  <dig> results, the genome of b. plantarii atcc 43733t was  <dig>  mbp and consisted of two chromosomes and one plasmid. chromosome  <dig> contained  <dig> ,040 bp  and  <dig>  predicted coding sequences , while chromosome  <dig> contained  <dig> ,649 bp  and  <dig>  cds; the plasmid bgla_1p contained  <dig>  bp  and  <dig> cds. although b. glumae bgr <dig> and b. gladioli bsr <dig> both have a genome comprising two chromosomes and four plasmids, the genome of b. plantarii atcc 43733t consists of two chromosomes and one plasmid. multiple genome alignment for these three burkholderia strains revealed a genome inversion in the middle of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in b. glumae bgr <dig> when compared to the genomes of b. gladioli bsr <dig> and b. plantarii atcc 43733t . the genome organization of b. plantarii atcc 43733t in the chromosome is much more similar to that of b. gladioli bsr <dig> than to that of b. glumae bgr <dig> . mummer analysis and the size of the chromosome genome  revealed a high number of genome deletions in chromosome  <dig> of b. glumae bgr <dig>  consistent with the observation of highly variable genome sizes in other b. glumae strains , the genome of b. glumae appeared to be much more active than that of b. gladioli and b. plantarii.table  <dig>

genome comparison, pan-genome analysis, and core-genome analysis
to obtain better understanding of the genomic characteristics of burkholderia rice pathogens as compared to a wider variety of burkholderia strains, we conducted pan-genome analysis of  <dig> burkholderia genomes , including those from animal/human pathogens and those isolated from environmental habitats. overall,  <dig>  orthologs were identified in all organisms, constituting the pan-genome of these  <dig> burkholderia strains . among the  <dig>  pan-genome genes,  <dig> genes were highly conserved among the  <dig> burkholderia genomes, constituting the core genome. interestingly, the omission of the b. glumae lmg  <dig> and b. glumae au <dig> strain genomes increased the number of genes in the core genome dramatically, to  <dig> genes. thus, these two b. glumae strains may have rapidly evolved under the given environmental conditions.

the new genome sequence of b. plantarii atcc 43733t identified in the present study was combined with two full genomes of b. gladioli bsr <dig> and b. glumae bgr <dig>  and four draft genomes in b. glumae and b. gladioli strains  to identify a total of  <dig>  orthologs that comprised the pan-genome of b. gladioli, b. glumae, and b. plantarii. among these  <dig>  genes,  <dig>  genes were highly conserved and constituted the core genome of these seven burkholderia strains . in addition, we identified  <dig>  b. glumae-specific and  <dig>  b. gladioli-specific genes. among the seven b. glumae strains, the size of the strain-specific genome was ~340– <dig> genes , with the exception of b. glumae bgr <dig>  which has only  <dig> strain-specific genes. as there were larger numbers of dispensable genes in b. glumae bgr <dig> than in other b. glumae strains, the b. glumae bgr <dig> genome could have stabilized or could be an original genome among these b. glumae strains.figure  <dig> pan-genome analysis of seven strains within b. glumae, b. gladioli, and b. plantarii. core, dispensable, and strain-specific genomes are indicated in different colors.



bacterial secretion system
diverse metabolites and proteins can be secreted into the environment or into host cells through bacterial secretion systems  <cit> . each bacterial system has its own unique function, including conjugation, and these systems sometimes share functions such as pathogenicity. the  <dig> burkholderia strains within b. glumae, b. gladioli, and b. plantarii species  have different numbers and types of secretion systems in their genomes. genes involved in secretion-signal recognition particle  and twin arginine targeting  systems were highly conserved among all seven burkholderia strains. the type iii secretion system  genes are also highly conserved in all  <dig> burkholderia strains, except for deletion of sctq, sctr, and scts in the b. glumae lmg_ <dig> and au <dig> strains. furthermore, with the exception of the partial sequence homology of hrpw in b. gladioli brs <dig>  the genes involved in the t3ss are nearly identical among b. glumae bgr <dig>  b. gladioli brs <dig>  and b. plantarii atcc 43733t .

evaluation of secretion system gene divergence revealed that all seven burkholderia strains within the glumae group have one conserved type ii secretion system  on chromosome  <dig>  however, b. plantarii atcc 43733t has an additional t2ss in chromosome  <dig>  while two b. gladioli strains have two additional partial t2ss. among the seven burkholderia strains within the glumae group, only b. glumae bgr <dig>  b. glumae au <dig>  and b. plantarii atcc 43733t have a type i secretion system , whereas only b. gladioli bsr <dig> and b. plantarii atcc 43733t have a type iv secretion system  in their genomes. thus, t1ss and t4ss show higher variability among the seven burkholderia strains within the glumae group, as species-dependent total deletion of t1ss or t4ss was observed.

when compared to other genera, burkholderia has a more diverse type vi secretion system  with up to six t6ss gene clusters. because the t6ss system can deliver bacterial proteins into both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, this secretion system is involved both in host pathogenesis and in anti-microbial mechanisms  <cit> . the t6ss apparatus structurally resembles an inverted bacteriophage tail that functions by injecting effector proteins directly into the cytosol of eukaryotic or bacterial cells. in particular, human- and animal-pathogenic b. pseudomallei and b. mallei have six t6ss gene clusters in their genome, four of which exist in both b. pseudomallei and b. mallei  <cit> . one t6ss is highly conserved among all  <dig> burkholderia strains within the glumae group, which each harbor 2– <dig> t6sss. six t6ss groups can be classified in burkholderia strains, based on the distribution of t6ss . t6ss_group <dig> was conserved in all genome-sequenced burkholderia strains except for b. xenovorans, and was highly conserved among the seven burkholderia strains within the glumae group. t6ss_group <dig> and t6ss_group <dig> were more specific to b. glumae or b. plantarii species: t6ss_group <dig> was only conserved among b. glumae and b. ambifaria; t6ss_group <dig> was only conserved among b. glumae and b. plantarii; and t6ss_group <dig> was only conserved among b. glumae, b. graminis, and b. plantarii. different numbers of t6ss and unique t6ss in each species or strain indicate that t6ss could contribute to various inter-species interactions, including pathogen-host interactions and interactions with other microbes in the burkholderia genus.

qs systems
bacterial qs is a form of cell-to-cell communication that uses chemical signaling between bacterial cells to regulate biological processes in response to environmental clues  <cit> . n-acylhomoserine lactone , the best known qs chemical signal, plays a key role in the regulatory circuit composed of a signal producer designated luxi and a cognate receptor-regulatory protein designated luxr  <cit> . burkholderia glumae bgr <dig> qs uses a tofi-tofr circuit, similar to the luxi-luxr circuit, to regulate toxoflavin biosynthesis, flagella regulation, and detoxification of reactive oxygen species   <cit> . remarkably, b. glumae bgr <dig> qs protects stationary-phase cells from self-intoxication by altering cellular metabolism through the production of oxalate  <cit> .

in this study, we surveyed ahl synthase and regulator in the genomes of  <dig> strains within b. glumae, b. gladioli, and b. plantarii species . overall,  <dig> paired ahl synthase-regulator circuits were identified in  <dig> strains . one paired ahl synthase-regulator circuit displayed high sequence homology in all  <dig> strains except for b. gladioli nbrc  <dig>  an additional paired ahl synthase-regulator circuit was found in the genome of b. gladioli bsr <dig>  residing in the polyketide synthesis operon of the plasmid. furthermore, b. plantarii atcc 43733t and b. glumae pg <dig> had two additional paired ahl synthase-regulator circuits; one ahl circuit  was located close to genes involved in the urea/branched-chain amino acid, and the other ahl circuit  resided near the genes involved in thiopurine biosynthesis.table  <dig>

aputative regulation is based on the location of synthase and regulator genes in the operon.



without the ahl synthase pair, seven to twelve orphan ahl regulators existed in the genome of these  <dig> burkholderia strains. three orphan ahl regulators were highly conserved in all  <dig> burkholderia strains. twelve orphan ahl regulators were randomly distributed in the genome of b. plantarii atcc. overall, b. plantarii atcc had the maximum number of ahl regulators among the  <dig> burkholderia strains, suggesting that this strain synthesizes diverse auto-inducers and activates complicated regulatory systems in response to bacterial cell-to-cell communication.

toxin production
burkholderia toxin is a key virulence factor responsible for diseases in plants. toxoflavin is the most well-known phytopathogenic burkholderia toxin produced by b. glumae, and is a host-nonspecific phytotoxin that is a very effective electron carrier and generates ros such as hydrogen  <cit> . genes involved in toxin biosynthesis were surveyed in  <dig> strains within b. glumae, b. gladioli, and b. plantarii species . toxoflavin biosynthesis genes were distributed in all  <dig> burkholderia strains except for b. plantarii atcc 43733t and b. glumae pg <dig> . all b. glumae and b. gladioli strains harbored genes involved in the biosynthesis and transport of toxoflavin, except for a deletion of toxi in the genome of b. glumae au <dig>  however, b. plantarii atcc 43733t only had the toxj gene, a regulator of toxin biosynthesis.table  <dig>

instead of producing toxoflavin, b. plantarii is known to produce tropolone as a phytotoxin and as a virulence factor causing seedling blight. rice seedlings exposed to tropolone typically exhibit symptoms similar to those of b. plantarii-mediated rice seedling blight  <cit> . when we surveyed all publicly available burkholderia strain genomes, the genes involved in tropolone biosynthesis were only identified in the genome of b. plantarii atcc 43733t and b. glumae pg <dig> . interestingly, one paired ahl synthase-regulator circuit  resided within the tropolone biosynthesis operon. this indicates that the regulation of tropolone biosynthesis may be dependent on bacterial cell-to-cell communication in a manner similar to that of the paired ahl circuit  in b. glumae bgr <dig>  which regulates toxoflavin biosynthesis according to bacterial cell density  <cit> , although these ahl circuit genes are not present in the toxoflavin biosynthesis operon.

genes involved in rhizotoxin biosynthesis were also identified in the genome of b. plantarii atcc 43733t. rhizotoxin is an antimitotic agent with antitumor activity  <cit> , isolated from a pathogenic plant fungus . rhizotoxin also causes rice seedling blight that results in the same symptoms as seedlings treated with tropolone. genes involved in rhizotoxin biosynthesis have also been identified in several strains of bacteria, including xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae kacc <dig> b. jyp <dig>  b. phymatum, b. phenoliruptrix , and b. glumae pg <dig> .

virulence-related enzymes
genes encoding polygalacturonases, cellulases, lipases and proteases are major virulence factors in diverse pathogenic bacteria. these enzymes are related to the virulence and their regulation in b. glumae has been comprehensively summarized  <cit> . the characteristics, regulation, and virulence function of polygalacturonases in b. glumae was intensively investigated and peha and pehb encoding two isoforms of polygalacturonases, have been discovered discovered  <cit> . the peha locus was mainly distributed in b. glumae strains, whereas the pehb locus was detected in all b. glumae, b. gladioli, and b. plantarii strains . the roles of lipases have been studied, not only in plant pathogenic strains but also in human pathogenic burkholderia strains with respect to the virulence  <cit> . the gene encoding the lipase lipa was detected in all b. glumae, b. gladioli, and b. plantarii strains except for b. glumae au <dig>  these virulence-related enzymes in the  <dig> burkholderia strains are summarized in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats -crispr-associated protein 
the crispr-cas system is a bacterial immune system that protects bacteria from invading viruses and transferring plasmids  <cit> . recent studies have indicated that the crispr-cas system acts as a barrier to horizontal gene transfer and as a modulator of gene expression  <cit> . the crispr-cas immune system blocks stable entry of foreign nucleic acids in three common steps: adaptation, crispr rna  biogenesis, and targeting  <cit> . during adaptation, viral or plasmid challenge stimulates the incorporation of short  invader-derived sequences between equally short dna repeats found in the crispr locus  <cit> . these unique sequences, which are known as spacers, primarily match viruses and other mobile genetic elements  <cit> .

we surveyed the crispr-cas system in  <dig> burkholderia genomes . remarkably, two b. plantarii atcc 43733t, b. gladioli usd ug_chapalote, b. glumae pg <dig>  and b. glumae 3252– <dig> strains have one crispr-cas system. the other eight strains in the b. glumae and b. gladioli species have only the crispr motif without cas proteins. however, no clear cripsr motif was identified in pathogenic-animal and human burkholderia strains. the cripsr-cas system in b. plantarii atcc 43733t had an internal stop codon in the middle of the cas <dig> gene, leading to two separate cas1; thus, the cas operon was composed of cas <dig> , cas <dig> , cas <dig> , csy <dig> , csy <dig> , csy <dig> , and csy <dig>  . among the  <dig> strains, b. gladioli, b. glumae, and b. plantarii species had four types of cripsr repeats, with the b. plantarii atcc 43733t and b. glumae 3252– <dig> strains sharing the common cripsr repeat . interestingly, b. glumae 3252– <dig> contained the cas operon between two cripsr repeats. other five b. glumae strains had one or two crispr repeats without the cas operon . these findings suggest that the cas operon was present in b. glumae, but was subsequently deleted in most b. glumae. deletion events of the cas operon may have occurred in many burkholderia strains; thus, we were only able to identify the cas operon in b. plantarii atcc 43733t, b. glaidioli usd ug_chapalote, b. glumae pg <dig>  and b. glumae 3252– <dig> from the genome sequences of over  <dig> burkholderia strains.figure  <dig> diagram of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  with crispr associated proteins  system in burkholderia species.  crispr-cas in b. plantarii atcc 43733t. r, s represent the crispr repeat and crispr spacer, respectively.  crispr-cas in b. glumae 3252– <dig> 



we analyzed crispr targets, based on sequences of the crispr spacers in b. plantarii atcc 43733t and b. glumae 3252– <dig>  using viroblast  or blast plasmid searches. the spacer/targeting sequences revealed diverse phage targets, including burkholderia phages, other bacterial phages, and various types of plasmids . interestingly, the crispr repeat  common to both b. plantarii atcc 43733t and b. glumae 3252– <dig> harbored the largest number of spacers. specifically, there were  <dig> spacers in b. plantarii atcc 43733t and  <dig> spacers in b. glumae 3252– <dig>  three of  <dig> spacers in b. plantarii atcc 43733t targeted several burkholderia phages, including phage bcepc6b, phage ks <dig>  and phage kl <dig>  as well as plasmids of b. ambifaria mc40- <dig>  b. cenocepacia, b. multivorans, and b. vietnamiensis with high sequence identities . however,  <dig> spacers among  <dig> in b. glumae 3252– <dig> targeted different types of bacteriophages, including murine adenovirus  <dig> and saccharopolyspora erythraea nrrl <dig> with high sequence identities, but did not target bacterial plasmids.

CONCLUSIONS
the complete genome sequencing of b. plantarii atcc 43733t performed in this study, and publicly available genomes of b. glumae bgr <dig> and b. gladioli bsr <dig>  enabled comprehensive comparative genome analyses among three rice-pathogenic burkholderia species responsible for tissue rotting and seedling blight. the genome organization and chromosome structure in b. plantarii atcc 43733t are more similar to those of b. gladioli bsr <dig>  which is consistent with the finding that b. plantarii atcc 43733t and b. gladioli bsr <dig> are closely related based on 16s rrna sequences. genome analyses of interesting gene clusters such as secretion system genes, toxin production genes, bacterial qs genes, and crispr-mediated immune system genes indicated that b. plantarii atcc 43733t has more diverse gene pairs in the qs-mediated ahl synthase-receptor circuit and in unique bacterial toxins such as tropolone and rhizotoxin. interestingly, only the genomes of b. plantarii atcc 43733t, b. glaidioli usd ug_chapalote, b. glumae pg <dig>  and b. glumae 3252– <dig> harbored complete crispr-cas systems, among all genome-sequenced for burkholderia strains. based on genome organization and toxin production, b. glumae pg <dig> was more closely related to b. plantarii atcc 43733t than to the other b. glumae strains. better knowledge of the variability and specificities of burkholderia organisms could contribute to an understanding of their capacity to adapt to different environments, as well as their unique interactions with the host during pathogenesis.
