BACKGROUND
obesity is the consequence of an imbalance between food intake and energy expenditure resulting in an excess accumulation of body fat. progress and course of obesity and its associated diseases are dependent on nutritional conditions and on other lifestyle parameters . however, its main basis is the complex, polygenic predisposition consisting of a network of variant genes which are still not completely known and difficult to identify in humans. genome-wide association studies  are commonly used for the identification of disease genes. nevertheless, the identified loci accounting only for a small proportion of the heritability of a complex disease like obesity  <cit> . genomic structural variants  may explain rare variants with large effects, which are not readily identifiable via snp-based methods .

genomic linkage studies in rodents are a suitable approach to identify and to study such chromosomal alterations. in a previous study we reported the identification of a major obesity qtl  on distal mouse chr. <dig> in an outcross population of the new zealand obese  strain, a polygenic mouse model for obesity, and the lean c57bl/6j  mouse. by generating recombinant congenic lines and expression studies we finally identified the ifi202b  gene as the causal variant of the nob <dig> locus. the transcriptional regulator ifi202b is a member of the ifi <dig> gene family, which has also been annotated as the pyhin family, acknowledging the defining features of an n-terminal pyrin domain and c-terminal hin domain  <cit> . the proteins are involved in the defense against infection through recognition of foreign dna, whereas ifi202b was also shown to be involved in the development of obesity  <cit> . the gene family is arranged as a cluster on mouse chromosome  <dig>  between the cell adhesion molecule  <dig>  gene and a cluster of olfactory receptors. the ifi202b gene is expressed in various tissues of the nzo strain but not transcribed in b <dig> mice and we hypothesized that this is due to a deletion of the first exon and the 5′-regulatory region  <cit> . the lack of ifi202b is specific for c57bl mice , whereas most other strains  express this gene  <cit> .

in the current study we clarified the exact genomic structural variation causing the ifi202b deficiency and demonstrated that a rare genomic alteration on mouse chr. <dig> is responsible for the development of obesity. we generated a nzo bac library and performed a de novo assembly of the complex ifi <dig> region on mouse chr.  <dig> by using pacbio long reads, a third generation sequencing  approach and characterized mice with the affected region in respect to different metabolic traits.

methods
bacterial artificial chromosome  library construction and screening
nzo  bac library was constructed from high molecular weight  genomic dna processed at amplicon express inc.  from liver tissue. all animal experiments were approved by the ethics committee of the state office of environment, health and consumer protection . with the restriction enzyme hindiii the hmw dna was partially digested  and ligated into the pcc1bac vector. ligations were transformed into dh10b e.coli cells and plated on lb agar. clones were picked and arranged onto 384-well plates, replicated and frozen at −80°c. screening of the bac library was also processed by amplicon express inc. by using nylon filters with arrayed library clones  and digoxigenin -labeled probes representing position  <dig> – <dig>  in the genomic sequence of ifi202b . the dig-labeled probe was generated from gdna by pcr using the primers ifi202b_for: tcttcagagtgatggtgttcg and ifi202b_rev: tgtttgcaagtgaagatcacaa. the ifi202b probe was found to hybridize to  <dig> bac clones with a size of 90– <dig> kb. two positive clones with a size of  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb were selected for sequencing. isolation of the high molecular weight plasmid from the e.coli cultures was performed with the phasepreptm bac dna kit  and the bacmax™ dna purification kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the phaseprep bac dna kit was used for cell harvesting, lysis, neutralization, and nucleic acid precipitation, whereas digestion of the residual rna, removal of residual impurities and final precipitation was done with the bacmax kit.

bac sequencing and sequence assembly
sequencing of the two bac clones  and assembling was processed by gatc biotech ag  using the smrt® technology pacbio rs ii. de novo assembly of bac inserts was performed with the standard smrt portal software including quality filtering of the reads, improvement of long reads through alignment of short reads, assembly of long reads, and assembly correction. the assembly of the reads was based on the hierarchical genome-assembly process .

comparative genomic hybridization assay
genomic dna was prepared from the tail of c57bl/6j and nzo/hibomdife mice. unamplified genomic dna was labeled with cy <dig>  or cy <dig>  and hybridization was performed by imagenes  using the nimblegen platform.

animals
breeding and genotyping
all animal experiments were approved by the ethics committee of the state office of environment, health and consumer protection . nzo mice from our own colony  and c57bl/6j  were used throughout the study. mice were kept at a temperature of 20 ±  <dig> °c with a 12: <dig> h light-dark cycle and had ad libitum access to drinking water and to a high-fat diet  containing  <dig> kcal% from fat,  <dig> kcal% from carbohydrates, and  <dig> kcal% from protein . congenic mice were generated on a b <dig> background and the offspring was selected in each generation for carrying the fragment  <dig> – <dig>  mbp from nzo on chr. <dig> . phenotypical characterization of female congenic mice were performed in the f10n <dig> generation. for genotyping, dna was prepared from mouse tails with a dna isolation kit based on a salt precipitation method  and used for tests with polymorphic microsatellite markers. microsatellites  were genotyped by pcr with oligonucleotide primers obtained from mwg , and the microsatellite length was determined by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

body composition and blood glucose
fat mass of nob <dig>  mice were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance  and blood glucose levels were measured in the morning  using a contour® xt glucometer .

histological analysis of adipose tissue
paraffin sections  of gonadal white adipose tissue  of 30-week-old nob <dig>  mice were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. microscopic images were captured with the keyence bz- <dig> fluorescent microscope and the corresponding bz-ii analyzer software .

metabolic phenotyping
oral glucose tolerance tests  were performed in 22-week-old mice. mice were fasted overnight and received  <dig> g/kg body weight of glucose . blood glucose and insulin concentrations were detected up to  <dig> min.

plasma analysis
plasma insulin levels were analyzed using the mouse ultrasensitive insulin elisa  following the manufacturer’s instructions.

protein extraction and western blotting
adipose tissue of nob <dig>  mice were homogenized in tes buffer . proteins were separated by sds-page, transferred to a pvdf membrane  and targeted proteins were detected by ecl prime detection reagent  using the fusion-sl <dig> advanced chemiluminescence system . primary antibodies against pparγ , phsl , thsl , β- actin , and appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies  were applied.

RESULTS
the ifi <dig> gene cluster developed as a consequence of gene duplications and rearrangements resulting in a divergence in the number of genes between various inbred strains of mice and in repetitive sequences even in coding regions between the different gene members. in order to clarify the genomic alteration responsible for the ifi202b deficiency in the b <dig> mouse we used the pacbio system, single-molecule real-time  sequencing approach, for de novo assembling of the critical region in the nzo strain.

for the screening of the nzo bac clones containing the relevant ifi202b upstream sequence a probe matching a unique ifi202b sequence was used. additionally a probe specific for the olfr <dig> gene was chosen to define the distal border of the region of interest; in contrast to the genomic ifi <dig> region the olfr <dig> gene represents a unique sequence within the mouse genome. in total, sequencing of the nzo bac clones mapped  <dig>  pacbio rs reads with a mean read length of  <dig>  kb  and a mean read quality of  <dig> . de novo assembly of the reads resulted in  <dig> contigs. however, two of them were not considered for further analysis  due to poor sequence quality. with the two remaining contigs  it was possible to assemble a region covering  <dig> genes that belongs to the ifi <dig> gene family and the olfactory receptor olfr <dig> as the distal boundary . as described earlier the nzo strain carries two copies of the ifi202b gene which differ in only  <dig> bp within the coding region, respectively  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . in addition, sequence analysis of the bac identified two copies of other family members; ifi <dig> and ifi <dig>  interestingly, by comparing the assembled nzo sequence with the b <dig> reference genome we identified a  <dig>  bp deletion affecting the ifi <dig> locus in respect to gene duplications.fig.  <dig> pacbio sequencing parameters. a read length distribution of the  <dig>  pacbio reads with an average read length of  <dig>  bp and maximal read length of  <dig>  bp . b quality distribution of the pacbio reads with an average quality of  <dig>

with a second-generation sequencing  approach it would have been impossible to solve the organization of the ifi <dig> cluster in nzo as sequences are mapped to the b <dig> reference genome and gaps within the reference genome will result in an incorrect alignment  <cit> . while the sgs approach is efficient for accurately identifying snps in the genome, it does not enable a thorough characterization of structural variations such as insertions and deletions . the short sequence read data has complicated the assembly of repetitive structures leading to the translation into gaps, missing data and more incomplete assembly . in contrast, the main advantage of tgs is the long read nature, which was reported to be as long as  <dig>  bp on average, and some reads are supposed to be  <dig>  bp or even longer. the long read length provides an important benefit for de novo assemblies, it allows the discovery of large structural variants, and it provides accurate microsatellite lengths, detection of sensitive snps, and haplotype blocks . tgs has successfully been used for de novo assembling of hundreds of microbial genomes and reconstruction of plant and animal genomes . it has also been applied to resequencing analysis, to create detailed maps of structural variations and phasing variants across large regions of human chromosomes .

the evolutionary analysis revealed a remarkable plasticity in the mammalian ifi <dig> genes, suggesting the existence of strong evolutionary pressures that have shaped the ifi <dig> sequences and functions throughout the mammalian lineage  <cit> . here, we report the identification of structural variations within the ifi <dig>  gene cluster in the obese nzo strain. cridland and colleagues presented a map comparing the human, c57bl/ <dig> mouse, and rat ifi <dig> gene loci. the mouse contains at least  <dig> mouse ifi <dig> genes, whereas the human and rat genome expresses only  <dig>  respectively  <dig>  <cit> . it was already published that the ifi <dig> gene locus is divergent between various mouse strains as the number of genes present at the locus and the sequence is different  <cit> . the number of predicted mouse genes has increased with each new update of the mouse genome database and in the current study with de novo assembling of the pacbio sequencing reads we can strengthen and expand this assumption to the obese nzo strain  <cit> . the nzo strain carries two copies of ifi202b  which was also found in the 129x1/svj mouse genome in addition to a pseudogene , whereas only one truncated copy is present in c57bl/ <dig> that is not expressed in metabolically relevant tissues  <cit> . another family member, ifi <dig>  showed two extra copies in nzo in comparison to b <dig>  also the ifi <dig> gene was duplicated as two regions, spanning the coding sequence of the gene, could be mapped in the nzo bac clones . to further verify the sequencing results we performed a comparative genomic hybridization assay  of genomic dna obtained from the b <dig> and the nzo strain to detect copy number variations  within the cluster. this analysis further supports that the nzo strain carries at least two copies of the genes ifi202b, ifi <dig>  and ifi <dig> . other studies also show the presence of gene duplications. she and colleagues  assessed cnvs between the b <dig> strain and  <dig> mouse strains  which were used for genetic association studies, sequencing, and the mouse phenome project  <cit> . the analysis also showed a duplication of the ifi <dig> gene. similar results were detected for ifi <dig> in the study by cahan et al.,  <dig> where cnvs in  <dig> mouse strains were analyzed  <cit> . in conclusion, de novo assembling of the nzo bac clone reads and the analysis of cnvs revealed structural variations between different inbred strains of mice within a complex region on chr.  <dig> caused by duplications and genomic alterations.fig.  <dig> identification of copy number variations  within the ifi <dig> cluster. results obtained from a comparative genomic hybridization assay  of genomic dna from the b <dig> and nzo strain . shown are the positions of the critical ifi <dig> cluster. the red line represents equal copies in b <dig> and nzo, whereas areas above  <dig>  indicates that two or more copies exist in nzo. regions corresponding to ifi <dig>  ifi202b, and ifi <dig> are highlighted




it is also documented that the corresponding region in humans is affected by genomic alterations. according to the  <dig> genomes project several deletions, cnv , and duplications can be mapped within this locus  <cit> . cagliani and colleagues performed an evolutionary analysis of the human family members  by analyzing inter- and intraspecies diversity and revealed that the genes have been repeatedly targeted by natural selection. especially the ifi <dig> gene region shows a high nucleotide diversity in human populations and indicates that the region has been a target of long-standing balancing selection  <cit> .

the main goal of the current study was to analyze the chromosomal alterations leading to the ifi202b deficiency in the b <dig> strain. with the bac sequencing we identified a deletion spanning approximately  <dig>  kb within the b <dig> genome, a sequence present in nzo. the deletion includes different copies of ifi200-family members, ifi <dig>  ifi <dig>  and exon  <dig> of ifi202b . in our previous study we identified an alternative first exon in the b <dig> reference genome . with the current study we are finally able to define the exact chromosomal region deleted in b <dig> and we can explain how this alternative exon  <dig> - which is an intronic sequence in nzo - is spliced to exon  <dig> of ifi202b in the b <dig> genome . the fact that b <dig> do not express ifi202b in the same tissues  as nzo indicates that in addition to the first exon also the promotor or at least part of it was deleted as well.

it is also reasonable to assume that the deleted region in b <dig> contains enhancer motifs/long-range control elements that drive and regulate the expression of other genes. in a previous study we reported that the genes lefty <dig>  pcp4l <dig>  and apoa <dig>  located in the same diabesity susceptibility locus as ifi202b , are exclusively present in islets of the diabetes-resistant b <dig> strain in contrast to the diabetes-prone nzo mouse. the identified genes are furthermore involved in the adaptive islet hyperplasia and prevention from severe diabetes in b6-ob/ob mice  <cit> . with the hereby reported data we hypothesize that the genomic alterations within the cluster may also include enhancer elements that carry the potential to regulate the expression of lefty <dig>  pcp4l <dig>  and apoa <dig>  by using the nsite program, a computer tool to search for regulatory elements , we found  <dig> predictive enhancer motifs that are located within the deleted sequence in the b <dig> genome which can potently be responsible for the described expression differences. a number of longe-range regulatory disruptions affecting the expression of genes have already been described  <cit> . one of the oldest examples of a human gene in which long-range regulations has been implicated and studied is sox <dig>  a gene responsible for autosomal sex reversal and campomelic dysplasia . all rearrangements including deletions are found from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb upstream of sox <dig> suggesting that a similar mechanism could also account for the expression differences between the diabetes-prone nzo and diabetes-resistant b <dig> strain of genes located within the nob <dig> locus  <cit> .

finally, to elucidate whether the genomic alteration on chr.  <dig> is also associated with metabolic alterations we generated and characterized congenic mice carrying  <dig>  mbp  of the nzo genome , including the ifi <dig> gene cluster, on b <dig> background. on hfd, homozygous nzo allele carriers developed a higher body weight and fat mass , in particular gonadal white adipose tissue , than the corresponding controls . histological analysis of the gonwat demonstrated that the adipocytes were larger in the nob <dig> 
n/n group than those of nob <dig> 
b/b mice . as these data points towards a role of the cluster in adipose tissue biology we tested the expression of proteins involved in adipocyte differentiation and lipolysis. western blot analysis indicated an increased expression of the adipogenic marker ppary  and a decreased activation of the lipolytic enzyme hsl  in gonwat of nzo allele carriers in comparison to controls . as obesity and hypertrophy of adipose tissue are also known to impair insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, we measured the glucose levels of the congenic lines. blood glucose levels were measured randomly and started to differ at the age of  <dig> weeks between the two groups with higher concentrations in nzo allele carriers . glucose clearance during oral glucose tolerance tests was not different between the two genotypes . however, the nob <dig> 
n/n mice required higher levels of insulin than nob <dig> 
b/b mice to clear blood glucose, pointing towards an insulin resistance  which is also indicated by calculating the homa-ir . in conclusion, introducing the genomic region of the ifi <dig> gene cluster of the nzo genome into the b <dig> genome results in the development of obesity and is associated with insulin resistance which demonstrates the functional consequences of the alteration on chr. <dig> fig.  <dig> insertion of the genomic nzo fragment containing the ifi <dig> cluster into the b <dig> strain induces obesity. body weight  and fat mass  development of nob <dig>

in different reports it was already published that rare gsvs are associated with obesity  <cit> . a rare ,  <dig> kb deletion on chromosome 16p <dig>   was shown to be significantly  enriched in obese patients compared to controls, whereas a duplication of the same locus has the opposite effect, being associated with underweight  <cit> . another study by wang et al.  <cit>  also showed large and rare cnvs that are associated with a higher risk to develop obesity. they reported several cnvs that affect known candidate genes for obesity, such as a  <dig> -mbp deletion disrupting nap1l <dig> and a  <dig> -mbp deletion disrupting ucp <dig> and il <dig>  one prominent example for chromosomal syndromes with obesity is the prader-willi syndrome  in which a 5– <dig> mb deletion of the paternally inherited chromosomal 15q <dig> -q <dig> region is responsible for a neurobehavioral disorder manifested by infantile hypotonia and feeding difficulties in infancy, followed by morbid obesity secondary to hyperphagia  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, by using tgs it was possible to assemble a complex genomic region on mouse chr.  <dig> containing different genes of the ifi <dig> cluster. this approach further leads to the identification of a vast chromosomal deletion including the regulatory part of the obesity-associated gene ifi202b, as well as one copy of ifi <dig> and one of ifi <dig> in the b <dig> strain which finally leads to an altered expression and consequently affecting the susceptibility to develop obesity.
