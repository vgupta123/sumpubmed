BACKGROUND
the human gut microbiome is a highly dense microbial ecosystem, largely outnumbering our own eukaryotic body cells. its intimate contact with our digestive system and its potential role in health and disease states makes this ecosystem very attractive for a deep characterization of its composition and function. in recent years, high-throughput sequencing has been the catalyst for analyzing microbial population diversity and functions. while bacterial 16s rrna gene survey can answer the question “which species are there”  <cit> , functional metagenomics can also address “what are they doing” by examining the sequences of genomic fragments and by exploiting, for instance, gene expression analysis by metatranscriptomics  <cit> . these approaches allow not only the characterization of individual organisms and their genes; but also metabolic and regulatory pathways, functional interactions inside a microbial community and crosstalk between a microbial community and its host.

functional metagenomic projects are highly interdisciplinary and involve numerous procedures, ranging from clinical protocols for sample collection to bioinformatics tools for data interpretation. strong biases can be introduced in each of these steps. sample storage conditions, one of the first steps, is critical for downstream analyses. previous studies had indicated that storing conditions of stool samples only modestly affect the structure of their microbial community  <cit> . however, little is known about the influence of storing conditions on more deep structural and functional analyses, which require maximal integrity of genomic dna and rna. intact dna fragments are critical for metagenomic library construction  <cit>  and to characterizing intact genetic pathways either by sequence-based or function screening-based approaches  <cit> . moreover, excessive degradation of dna reduces the efficiency of shotgun sequencing  <cit> . the recovery of total rna with high integrity is necessary for proper cdna synthesis and absolutely essential for describing the gene expression in a community sample  <cit> .

in the present study, we compared the effect of different storage conditions of stool samples on microbial community composition, genomic dna and total rna integrity.

RESULTS
effect of storage conditions on genomic dna
in order to investigate the effect of storage conditions on the quality of genomic dna, we chose a subset of stool samples collected by  <dig> volunteers  and that had been stored in the following  <dig> conditions: immediately frozen at −20°c ; immediately frozen  and then unfrozen during 1 h and 3 h; kept at room temperature  during 3 h, 24 h and 2 weeks. in this case, all  <dig> samples were kept at −80°c in the laboratory until genomic dna was extracted and its integrity analyzed using microcapillary electrophoresis.

in all the tested conditions the amount of dna obtained was in the range of 70–235 μg/250 mg of fecal sample, which is sufficient for downstream analysis such as metagenomic library construction or shotgun sequencing  <cit> . as illustrated in figure  <dig> microcapillary electrophoresis revealed that genomic dna was mostly preserved as high-molecular weight fragments when samples were stored immediately after collection at −20°c in a home freezer or left up to 3 h at room temperature. however, dna became fragmented when samples were allowed to unfreeze during 1 h  or stored at room temperature over 24 h . dna degradation further increased and nearly all high-molecular weight fragments disappeared when samples had been kept over 2 weeks at room temperature . in order to provide a semi-quantitative comparison, we extracted the signal intensity from the gel using the imagej software. this signal is converted into a number that is proportional to the dna quantity. as shown in figure  <dig>  we used the upper size-range  of the frozen sample as a proxy for “no degraded dna” and the lower size-range  for “degraded dna” . the threshold of  <dig>  kb was used to discriminate the  <dig> size-ranges, since it is recommended for shotgun sequencing in the  <dig> protocol from roche applied science. proportion of degraded dna for each sample was then calculated by the ratio between the lower size-range intensity and the total intensity. our results, displayed in table  <dig>  showed a significant degradation  for all storage conditions compared to frozen samples except those kept at room temperature for 3 h. therefore, storing fecal samples at room temperature over 3 h after collection or allowing them to thaw and refreeze is not recommended for shotgun metagenomic sequencing, since dna extracted from these samples can be significantly fragmented. 

statistical analysis was performed using poisson regression model; p value <  <dig>  is considered significant; # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig> correspond to subjects  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  4; f = frozen; uf1h = unfrozen during 1 h; uf3h = unfrozen during 3 h; rt = room temperature; 2w = 2 weeks.

even though mechanical disruption of the samples used in our extraction method could damage the integrity of large dna molecules, we believe that storage conditions, more than directly degrade dna during storage period or the extraction step, dysregulate cellular compartments and activate enzymatic activities . further studies could be designed in order to test the effect of different extraction methods including mechanical or non-mechanical disruption on dna integrity.

effect of storage conditions on microbial diversity
although storage conditions of stool samples greatly affected the integrity of bacterial dna, this observation did not demonstrate an impediment for metagenomic analyses. in order to verify this extreme, we examined to which extent storage conditions could bias intestinal microbial composition. by using the genomic dna extracted from the  <dig> samples obtained from the  <dig> above cited volunteers , we pcr-amplified the v <dig> region of the 16s rrna gene and sequenced the products using a gs flx  <dig> pyrosequencer. we obtained a total of  <dig>  high quality sequences, which we then analyzed using the qiime pipeline to determine and compare the microbial diversity.

we validated the presence of a bacterial species or taxon when its abundance was higher than  <dig> % in at least one sample. accordingly, we identified a total of  <dig> taxa after validating an average of  <dig>  sequences and  <dig> taxa per sample . these  <dig> species classified into  <dig> genera and  <dig> phyla as follows: firmicutes , bacteroidetes , actinobacteria  and proteobacteria .

alpha-diversity analysis showed that the storage procedures did not influence the total number of observed taxa  and did not greatly alter the bacterial composition of the samples at the phylum level  except the samples from subject # <dig>  however, the storage conditions had a large impact on the taxonomic composition of the samples at the genus and species level for all subjects . variations were found depending on both the storage condition and the individual. in table  <dig>  we showed the effect of storage conditions on the proportion of  <dig> main bacterial taxa. as shown in this table, the abundance comparison between frozen and unfrozen samples was affected by thawing samples for 1 h and 3 h as exemplified by the significant decrease of a dominant unknown taxon from the bacteroides genus  to 13%  and to 9% ). the proportion of the two other bacterial taxa was significantly affected when thawing the samples over 3 h . the room temperature condition was only significantly affecting the bacterial proportion after 2 weeks  as shown in table  <dig> 

statistical analysis was performed using poisson regression model; p value <  <dig>  is considered significant; n =  <dig> subjects; * values are mean proportion of sequences .

f = frozen; uf1h = unfrozen during 1 h; uf3h = unfrozen during 3 h; taxonomy is indicated at the genus level and if not possible at the family level.

statistical analysis was performed using poisson regression model. * values are mean proportion of sequences . p-value <  <dig>  is considered significant; n =  <dig> subjects; f = frozen; uf1h = unfrozen during 1 h; uf3h = unfrozen during 3 h; rt = room temperature; 2w = 2 weeks; taxonomy is indicated at the genus level and if not possible at the family level.

to further compare the  <dig> samples, we used the weighted unifrac upgma method to build a clustering tree. the result showed that frozen samples, 3 h and 24 h room temperature samples tend to cluster together and far from the defrosted and 2 weeks room temperature samples . this analysis also indicated that, under these later conditions, intra-individual variability became higher than inter-individual one.

the above analyses on the effect of storage conditions on microbial diversity corroborate previous observations showing a relative stable community composition when stool samples are kept up to 24 h at room temperature  <cit> . however, our study reveals that under more prolonged conditions  or by changing temperature , the relative abundances of most taxa can be greatly altered in the bacterial community.

effect of storage conditions on total rna
the integrity of total rna is a critical parameter for metatranscriptomic analyses. degradation of rna compromises results of downstream applications, such as qrt-pcr  <cit>  or microarray studies  <cit> . in order to assess the effect of storage conditions on total rna recovery and integrity, we asked  <dig> volunteers  to collect fecal samples and submit small aliquots to the following  <dig> conditions: immediately frozen at −20°c ; immediately frozen and then unfrozen during 1 h and 3 h ; kept at room temperature during 3 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 2 weeks . the  <dig> samples so processed were brought at the laboratory and kept at −80°c until rna was extracted and analyzed. among these  <dig> volunteers,  <dig> individuals also agreed to provide fecal samples that after collection were immediately mixed with a commercial rnase inhibitor solution  and kept at room temperature during 3 h, 24 h, 14 days and 1 month. the  <dig> samples obtained were brought at the laboratory at room temperature and directly processed for rna extraction and analysis. rna quality was examined by means of microcapillary electrophoresis  and the average rna integrity number  of all samples was compared for each storage condition . 

in all the conditions tested, the amount of rna extracted was above 30 μg per 250 mg of stool, which is adequate for downstream analyses such as qrt-pcr and microarray experiments. when samples were immediately frozen after collection, extracted rna had average rin numbers above the value  <dig>  which is the threshold acceptable for conducting metatranscriptomic studies  <cit> .

however, unfreezing these samples during 1 h or 3 h before starting rna extraction produced a strong rna degradation, as illustrated in figure 1a by the fading of the 23s rrna band and the appearance of numerous bands below the 16s rrna. decrease of the rin numbers was significant after thawing samples for 1 h  and 3 h  compared to frozen samples. conversely, when samples were kept at room temperature during few hours  rather than immediately frozen after collection, total rna extracted did not show signs of fragmentation and average rin numbers were above  <dig>  longer storage periods at room temperature  produced a progressive fragmentation of the rna. indeed, decrease in rin number became significant when samples were kept at room temperature during 48 h . finally, when samples were kept at room temperature in rnase inhibitor solution, they showed less signs of fragmentation even after 4 weeks . in these conditions, however, there was a large rin number variability among individuals .

thus, our results indicate that the best storing condition to extract high quality rna for metatranscriptomic analyses is to keep the stool samples at room  temperature no more than few hours  after collection. alternatively, samples can be kept at −20°c for longer periods as long as defrosting is prevented until the extraction of rna starts in the laboratory. the rin variability observed in samples mixed with rna inhibitor could reflect an insufficient homogenization of hard stools . although the subjects could be asked to mix more thoroughly their stool after collection, this requirement is difficult to monitor. therefore, the use of rnase inhibitors may not be the best choice for semi or large-scale studies.

CONCLUSIONS
our study, although under a context of a small sampling size and other limiting parameters, suggests that storage conditions of stool samples can largely affect the integrity of extracted dna and rna and the composition of their microbial community. in light of our observations, our recommendation for semi or large-scale metagenomic and metatranscriptomic projects is to keep the samples at room temperature and to bring them in the laboratory within the initial  <dig> hours after collection. alternatively, if bringing the samples during this period is not possible, samples should be stored immediately at −20°c in a home freezer. in this case, samples need to be transported afterwards in freezer packs to ensure that they do not defrost at any time. mixing the samples with rnase inhibitors and keeping them at home for longer periods of time  is not recommended since proper homogenization of the stool is difficult to monitor outside the laboratory.
