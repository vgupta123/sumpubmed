BACKGROUND
candida albicans is an important human fungal pathogen that is associated with biofilm formation on indwelling medical devices like urinary catheters, dental prostheses and silicone voice prostheses  <cit> . cells released from these biofilms can migrate to the bloodstream and can cause systemic infections  <cit> . fungal biofilms are highly resistant against most commonly used antimycotics  <cit> . since no therapy is able to completely eradicate c. albicans biofilms, colonization of these medical devices often results in their functional loss and in most cases necessitates removal and/or replacement of the device  <cit> . c. albicans biofilm formation occurs in different stages of development. initially, the cells adhere to a surface and form microcolonies. subsequently, cells in these microcolonies form hyphae and produce an extracellular matrix, which results in a threedimensional structure  <cit> . the molecular basis of c. albicans biofilm formation and development is not completely understood. it is, however, well-established that interaction of c. albicans with host cells or inert surfaces leads to changes in gene expression. different studies have already described changes in gene expression levels during biofilm development  <cit> . for example, garcia-sanchez et al. showed that approximately 5% of all c. albicans genes are differentially expressed in growing biofilms compared to stationary phase cultured planktonic cells. one of these genes, als <dig>  was clearly upregulated in c. albicans biofilm cells  <cit> . using various clinical isolates, o'connor et al. recently demonstrated that when compared to planktonic cells, the als <dig> gene is overexpressed in biofilms formed on silicone elastomer using the absolute quantitative qpcr method  <cit> . rt -pcr studies of als <dig> in c. albicans biofilms formed on reconstituted human epithelial cells detected als <dig> gene expression over time during the destruction of the epithelium  <cit> . the als <dig> gene belongs to the als gene family, which encodes cell surface glycoproteins  <cit> . the als <dig> gene, another gene belonging to the als gene family has been shown to be upregulated in c. albicans hyphae, which suggests that als <dig> might also play a role in biofilm development by this organism  <cit> .

monitoring gene expression by measuring mrna levels in biofilm and planktonic cells may identify candidate genes involved in biofilm formation. mrna can be analyzed via different assays such as northern blot and rt-pcr. however, relative quantitative pcr  assays can detect more subtle changes in gene expression, as qpcr data can be normalised against a reference transcript to correct for differences in amount of starting material, rna integrity, sample to sample variation and rt efficiencies  <cit> . ideally, reference genes used in relative qpcr studies are housekeeping genes or control genes that are equally expressed in different conditions. several housekeeping genes have already been used in c. albicans gene expression studies, including act <dig> , pma <dig>  and tef <dig>   <cit> . however, numerous studies have shown that the expression of many housekeeping genes is differentially regulated depending on the experimental conditions  <cit> . recently, vandesompele et al. showed that the use of multiple control genes results in a much more accurate and reliable normalization of gene expression data  <cit> . these authors developed a vba applet called genorm that allows the determination of the most stably expressed genes from a series of housekeeping genes and of the number of genes required for accurate normalization.

in the present study, we investigated the expression of eight housekeeping genes in c. albicans biofilm and planktonic cells by qpcr analysis and subsequent genorm analysis. to evaluate different normalization strategies we compared als <dig> and als <dig> gene expression levels in c. albicans biofilm and planktonic cells.

RESULTS
rna and cdna quantity
different biological replicate samples  were obtained after  <dig> hours of growth, as described in materials and methods. total rna was extracted from biofilms and planktonic cells  and cdna synthesis was performed. the rna and cdna concentrations of all the samples are listed in table  <dig>  the average rna and cdna concentrations of the planktonic cells were   <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/μl and  <dig> ±  <dig>  μg/ml, respectively. the average rna and cdna concentrations of the biofilm cells were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/μl and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml, respectively.

standard curves and real time pcr efficiency
standard curves were generated for all the sample/gene combinations by using the cycle threshold  value versus the logarithm of each dilution factor. the linear correlation coefficient ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . initial amplification efficiencies   ranged from 80% to 100%, except for the cpa <dig>  imh <dig> and lsc <dig> genes . various primer and probe concentrations were retested for those genes, until efficiencies of >80% were obtained . agarose gel-electrophoresis of the amplified products showed a single band of the expected size for each qpcr assay. no primer dimers or non-specific amplification products could be observed. the inter-plate variation was <  <dig>  ct for every gene tested.

expression stability of housekeeping genes
the m value of the eight housekeeping  genes for all the samples  and biofilm and planktonic cells separately are listed in table  <dig>  this m value is defined as the average pairwise variation of one particular gene compared to all the other control genes. the gene with the lowest m value is considered as the most stable gene and the gene with the highest m value is excluded. a new m value is calculated and this procedure is repeated until only two genes are left. these two genes have the lowest m value and are therefore most stably expressed in all the samples. in fig.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the eight control genes are ranked according to their increasing expression stability , for all samples , planktonic cells  and biofilm cells . for all samples combined, the genes are ranked from most stable to least stable as follows: act <dig> and pma <dig>  rip, rpp2b, lsc <dig>  imh <dig>  cpa <dig> and gapdh . no significant improvement in normalization could be observed by using more than five control genes . when considering biofilms and planktonic cells separately, no significant improvement between the use of two or more than two housekeeping genes was obtained . the two most stably expressed control genes in c. albicans biofilm and planktonic cells separately were the act <dig> and rpp2b genes, and the rpp2b and pma <dig> genes, respectively.

als <dig> and als <dig> expression in c. albicans biofilms
cdna was amplified using a real time pcr mgb  taqman probe assay. the absolute ct values from all the qpcr assays were used to calculate the expression ratios of the als <dig> and als <dig> genes in c. albicans biofilm cells compared to their planktonic counterparts. table  <dig> shows the mean expression ratios of the als <dig> and als <dig> genes in c. albicans biofilm cells calculated with the four different normalization strategies . these ratios are based on the expression of those two genes in all the biofilm samples compared to all the planktonic samples. statistical analysis shows a significant upregulation of the als <dig> gene in c. albicans biofilm cells . when using different normalization methods, we found that the als <dig> gene expression was three-fold , four-fold  or five-fold  induced in c. albicans biofilms compared to planktonic cells. in contrast, there appeared to be a significant downregulation of the als <dig> gene in c. albicans biofilms . we found a fourteen-fold , twelve-fold , seven-fold  or ten-fold  downregulation of the als <dig> gene.

we also compared the als <dig> and als <dig> gene expression ratios obtained with the four different normalization strategies. no statistically significant difference in als <dig> and als <dig> gene expression ratios was observed when using the geometric mean of the relative expression levels of three or five housekeeping genes nor with standardization of the cdna input. however, normalization using act <dig> as a single reference transcript resulted in higher expression ratios, both for als <dig> and als <dig> compared to the other strategies .

discussion
this study describes a comparison between different normalization strategies used in relative rt-qpcr for the quantification of gene expression levels in c. albicans biofilm cells, grown on silicone in the cdc reactor, with reference to their planktonic counterparts. we also investigated als <dig> and als <dig> gene expression levels in c. albicans biofilms.

the expression levels of the als <dig> gene in c. albicans biofilm cells have previously been studied using different techniques, including absolute rt-qpcr, rt-pcr and micro-array analysis  <cit> . the choice of an appropriate reference gene for normalization in relative rt-qpcr is critical for accurate and reliable analysis of gene expression data. however, the selection of control genes used for normalization of qpcr data in c. albicans is often arbitrary and/or based on observations from previous studies. commonly used housekeeping genes are the act <dig> and pma <dig> genes  <cit> . however, no single reference gene is expressed constantly in every experimental setup. transcription levels of control genes used in relative rt-qpcr may vary significantly between different cell types and different developmental stages  <cit> .

therefore, we empirically validated the expression stability of multiple housekeeping genes in c. albicans biofilms and planktonic cells in order to use them as reference transcripts for determining gene expression data. we found that five control genes are required for accurate normalization of gene expression in c. albicans biofilms . these results suggest that the use of two, three or four control genes significantly alters the normalization factor and thus decreases the reliability and accuracy of gene expression data in c. albicans biofilms and planktonic cells. when considering biofilm and planktonic cells separately, we found that the act <dig> and rpp2b genes  and the pma <dig> and rpp2b genes  were the two most stably expressed genes. there was no significant improvement in the normalization factor when using more than two genes for normalization in biofilm cells and planktonic cells separately. furthermore, the pairwise variation is much higher in biofilm cells than in planktonic cells, suggesting that the expression levels of the control genes tested in the present study are less stable in biofilm cells than in their planktonic counterparts.

rna quantity is also a very important factor for accurate and reliable analysis of gene expression data. therefore, we evaluated the amount of total rna recovered from biofilm and planktonic cells prior to cdna synthesis. we found that more total rna was extracted from planktonic cells than from biofilm cells. we also observed a larger sample-to-sample variation in amount of total rna for biofilm cells than for planktonic cells. these results suggest that the rna extraction from biofilm cells is less efficient. to minimize variation of the input rna in the rt reaction, we decided to standardize the amount of input rna. this normalization step is essential in the protocol we used  since the amount of total rna in the rt reaction is restricted to  <dig> μg per reaction.

to compare different normalization strategies for gene expression analysis in c. albicans biofilms using relative rt-qpcr, we investigated the als <dig> and als <dig> gene expression levels in c. albicans biofilm and planktonic cells. compared to the other normalization strategies, normalization with act <dig> as a control gene gives significantly different results . these results clearly indicate the need for a more reliable normalization method. therefore, we suggest to use five control genes for normalization of gene expression data in c. albicans biofilms. for all normalization strategies, we observed a broad range in als <dig> and als <dig> expression ratios when comparing all "biofilm vs. planktonic" sample combinations . therefore, it is critical to analyze several independent samples to detect small fold changes.

we have chosen to analyze the expression of als <dig> and als <dig> genes because they encode large glycoproteins implicated in adhesion  <cit> . therefore, these genes could be involved in adhesion to silicone and may contribute to biofilm formation and development on medical devices.

c. albicans planktonic cells were harvested during stationary phase. similarly, biofilm cells were harvested when the biofilm had reached it maximal biomass, i.e. a condition similar to stationary phase . our findings demonstrate that in our model system, the als <dig> gene is overexpressed in biofilms compared to their planktonic counterparts. furthermore, we observed an underexpression of the als <dig> gene. microscopic evaluation revealed that under the conditions used, c. albicans forms biofilms with a marked three-dimensional structure consisting of both yeast cells and hyphae. in addition, the planktonic culture contained a lot of hyphae as well. as it was previously shown that als <dig> gene expression was upregulated in hyphae  <cit> , this could explain why we could not observe an overexpression of the als <dig> gene in biofilm cells. however, differences in expression between the als <dig> and als <dig> genes may indicate different functions of als1p and als3p in c. albicans biofilm development.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study which validates different normalization methods in order to study changes in fold expression of genes in c. albicans biofilms. we suggest to use the geometric mean of five housekeeping genes for the investigation of gene expression in c. albicans biofilms compared to planktonic cells. this assay could be useful in the determination of differentially expressed genes in c. albicans biofilms compared to their planktonic counterparts. moreover, this normalization method could be applied to monitor the kinetics of als <dig> and als <dig> gene expression during biofilm development. further information about the expression profiles in c. albicans biofilms could help to better understand the molecular basis of adhesion to and biofilm formation on silicone and other biomaterials.
