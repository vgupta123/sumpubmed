BACKGROUND
vibriosis, caused by vibrio spp., is a major disease of marine fish and shellfish and is an important cause of economic loss in aquaculture  <cit> . until recently prophylactic antibiotics were extensively used in aquaculture  <cit> . however, overuse of antibiotics resulted in increased rates of resistance so that novel approaches are required to manage vibriosis  <cit> . a possible novel target is the bacterial communication system. bacteria monitor their population densities through the production and sensing of small signal molecules called autoinducers, a process entitled as quorum sensing . to date three types of qs systems have been identified in vibrio spp.  <cit> . acylated homoserine lactones  are used as signal molecules in the luxm/n qs system  <cit> , while in the cqsa/s system, -3-hydroxytridecan-4-one  is used  <cit> . a third qs system appears to be shared by many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and is based on a mixture of interconvertible molecules collectively referred to as autoinducer- <dig>   <cit> . a key enzyme in the production of ai- <dig> is luxs. luxs catalyzes the cleavage of s-ribosylhomocysteine to homocysteine and  <dig> -dihydroxy- <dig> -pentanedione   <cit> . dpd will subsequently undergo spontaneous derivatizations, forming a mixture of molecules, including -2-methyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran  and -2-methyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran-borate   <cit> . although not all qs systems are present in all vibrio spp., most of them contain the ai- <dig> based qs system  <cit> . in vibrio spp. ai- <dig> binds to luxp, a periplasmic ai- <dig> receptor that is associated with the luxq sensor kinase-phosphatase. at low population density only basal amounts of diffusible signal molecules are produced, and in this situation luxq will act as a kinase resulting in a phosphorylation of the response regulator luxo through a cascade involving luxu. phosphorylation activates luxo resulting in the production of small regulatory rnas  <cit> . these small rnas, together with the chaperone protein hfq, will destabilize mrna encoding the response regulator luxr. however, when population density is sufficiently high, ai- <dig> will bind to luxp and as a result luxq will act as a phosphatase, leading to a dephosphorylation of luxo  <cit> . since dephosphorylated luxo is inactive, no small regulatory rnas will be formed and the luxr mrna remains stable, resulting in the production of luxr and ultimately an altered gene expression pattern. ai- <dig> based qs was found to play an important role in regulating the production of several virulence factors, biofilm formation and stress responses in several vibrio spp.  <cit>  and it was found to be associated with virulence as shown in several in vivo assays  <cit> . in contrast, in vibrio cholerae, cai- <dig> was found to be the principle signal molecule in virulence regulation  <cit> . because of this involvement in virulence, inhibitors of ai- <dig> based qs have been proposed as novel antipathogenic agents. while there is a growing interest in and evidence for the use of these antipathogenic substances to interfere with interspecies qs in the control of virulence and biofilm formation, only a few inhibitors of ai- <dig> based qs are known, including halogenated furanones and cinnamaldehyde  <cit> . halogenated furanones have previously been shown to disrupt ahl and ai- <dig> based quorum sensing in vibrio spp. by decreasing the dna-binding activity of the response regulator luxr  <cit> . halogenated furanones can attenuate the virulence of several vibrio spp. in gnotobiotic brine shrimp artemia franciscana and their use results in a reversal of the negative effects of vibrio harveyi bb <dig> towards rotifers  <cit> . unfortunately, the toxicity of halogenated furanones towards both brine shrimp and rotifers limits their use. in contrast, cinnamaldehyde is a non-toxic synthetic flavouring substance that is widely used in food, beverages, chewing gum, and the perfume and food chemistry, and is generally recognised as safe  <cit> . cinnamaldehyde concentrations in food range from  <dig> ppm to more than  <dig> ppm  <cit> . although cinnamaldehyde is known to be a qs-inhibitor  <cit> , its exact mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. the goal of the present study was to determine the mechanism of action of cinnamaldehyde and to evaluate its effect on virulence of vibrio spp. in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
effect of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde derivatives on microbial growth
when used in concentrations up to  <dig> μm, cinnamaldehyde and most cinnamaldehyde derivatives  had no inhibitory effect on the growth of strains in the present study . the same was true for 4-no2-cinnamaldehyde, but only in concentrations up to  <dig> μm. in all further experiments,  <dig> μm was used , unless otherwise mentioned.

effect of cinnamaldehyde and 2-no2-cinnamaldehyde on bioluminescence
to rule out direct interference with the bioluminescence system of vibrio harveyi, a constitutively bioluminescent strain was constructed. a plasmid containing luxcdabe genes under lacz promotion was conjugated into escherichia coli dh5α . the bioluminescence was not inhibited by cinnamaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde derivatives  and these results indicate that the enzymes of vibrio harveyi involved in bioluminescence are not inhibited by cinnamaldehyde or cinnamaldehyde derivatives.

effect of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde derivatives on ai- <dig> based qs
since bioluminescence is a qs regulated phenotype in vibrio harveyi, we evaluated the effect of the different compounds on bioluminescence in this species. in a first screening we used vibrio harveyi bb <dig>  it was observed that all of the compounds blocked the ai- <dig> qs system in a concentration-dependent way . at  <dig> μm, cinnamaldehyde and 2-no2-cinnamaldehyde were found to be the most active compounds, yielding an inhibition of  <dig> ± 13% and  <dig> ± 7%, respectively. 2-meo-cinnamaldehyde, 4-meo-cinnamaldehyde and 4-me2n-cinnamaldehyde were found to be less active at this concentration, with inhibitions of  <dig> ± 5%,  <dig> ± 9% and  <dig> ± 1%, respectively. the effect of 4-no2-cinnamaldehyde was only evaluated at lower concentrations because of its growth inhibitory effect. it was found to be the most active compound at concentrations of  <dig> and  <dig> μm, with inhibitions of  <dig> ± 11% and  <dig> ± 7%, respectively. in general, the qs inhibition assay detected several active qs inhibitors and some striking structure-activity relationships. the inhibitory effect was highly dependent on the substitution pattern of the aromatic ring. replacement of the dimethylamine  substituent with a methoxy  or a nitro  group enhanced the activity. in both the methoxy and the nitro series the activity dropped  upon moving the substituent from the para to the ortho position. in general, no cinnamaldehyde derivative was found to be more active than the unsubstituted cinnamaldehyde at concentrations of  <dig> μm and only one compound, 2-no2-cinnamaldehyde, was found to result in the same level of inhibition. at lower concentrations, 4-no2-cinnamaldehyde was significantly more active than the unsubstituted cinnamaldehyde, but the growth inhibitory effect of this compound prohibited its testing at higher concentrations.

effect of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde derivatives on the bioluminescence of vibrio harveyi qs mutants
bioluminescence in vibrio harveyi bb <dig> is mainly controlled by ai- <dig>  as this strain is not responsive to ahl stimulation  <cit> . hence we limited the possible target of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde derivatives to the ai- <dig> qs system. to determine the molecular target within the ai- <dig> qs pathway we measured the effect of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde derivatives on the bioluminescence in different qs mutants. vibrio harveyi mm <dig> has a mutation in the luxs gene, making it incapable of producing ai- <dig>  however, this strain will react to exogenously added ai- <dig> with activation of the qs transduction system leading to bioluminescence. inhibition of bioluminescence in this mutant would suggest the absence of an inhibitory effect on luxs. further we evaluated the effect of the test compounds on the production of ai- <dig> in escherichia coli k <dig>  the vibrio harveyi jaf <dig> and jaf <dig> mutants contain a point mutation in the luxu and luxo genes, respectively, thereby preventing their phosphorelay capacity. vibrio harveyi bnl <dig> has a tn <dig> insertion in the hfq gene, resulting in a non-functional hfq protein. vibrio harveyi strains jaf <dig>  jaf <dig> and bnl <dig> are all constitutively luminescent and inhibition of bioluminescence in one of these indicates that the cinnamaldehyde compounds act downstream of the mutated protein. cinnamaldehyde and 2-no2-cinnamaldehyde were found to block bioluminescence in vibrio harveyi mm <dig> , suggesting that these compounds do not exert their effect at the level of ai- <dig> production but rather at the level of the qs transduction system. affirmatively, the supernatants of escherichia coli k <dig> treated with cinnamaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde derivatives revealed no difference in ai- <dig> activity compared to the control . cinnamaldehyde and 2-no2-cinnamaldehyde were found to block bioluminescence to the same extent in all other mutants tested . this suggests that the target of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde derivatives is the downstream component of the ai- <dig> signalling transduction pathway, the transcriptional regulatory protein luxr.

effect of cinnamaldehyde on luxr protein levels and on luxr dna-binding activity
using purified luxr protein, the presence of  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm cinnamaldehyde resulted in a maximal difference in luxr dna shift compared to the untreated control . these data indicate that in vitro binding of the transcriptional regulator luxr to its promoter sequence is affected in the presence of cinnamaldehyde. surprisingly, when adding higher concentrations of cinnamaldehyde  no difference in shift could be observed anymore. this inconsistency was also observed for high furanone concentrations and may be due to aspecific interactions with dna and/or protein, although the exact reasons for this remain unknown . purified luxr was also used to test whether cinnamaldehyde resulted in protein degradation. three samples of luxr containing varying amounts of cinnamaldehyde  and an untreated control were stained following electrophoresis on a 10% sds-page gel and were shown not to have been affected by cinnamaldehyde . to test whether the dna-binding ability was also altered in vivo, lysates of vibrio harveyi cells that were grown in the presence and absence of various cinnamaldehyde concentrations were also tested for their ability to cause a mobility shift of luxr dna . surprisingly, no effects were observed with concentrations <  <dig> mm. using  <dig> mm cinnamaldehyde, there was about 4-fold less shift of luxr dna for the same amount of total protein in the lysate of vibrio harveyi bb <dig> treated with cinnamaldehyde. there are several possible explanations for this apparent contradiction in terms of cinnamaldehyde concentrations required to cause a band shift. first of all, there may be considerable differences between the extra- and intracellular cinnamaldehyde concentrations, possibly explaining why we observed a shift with  <dig>  mm cinnamaldehyde when purified luxr protein was used but that higher concentrations were required when cell lysates were used. secondly, there are no data on how much inhibition of binding of luxr to its promotor is required in order to observe phenotypic changes . it may very well be that relatively minor changes in luxr dna binding  are sufficient to cause reductions in bioluminescence but would go unnoticed in the gel shift assay. combined, our data indicate that in the presence of cinnamaldehyde binding of the transcriptional regulator luxr to its promoter sequence is affected, while leaving the protein intact. however, further research is needed to explain the differences between the in vitro and in vivo situation in terms of the cinnamaldehyde concentration required to observe this effect. interestingly, the best-studied qs inhibitors, halogenated furanones, also interfere with binding of luxr to its promoter sequence without degrading the protein  <cit> .

effect of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde derivatives on vibrio anguillarum protease and pigment production
cinnamaldehyde and 2-no2-cinnamaldehyde were found to decrease protease activity by  <dig> ± 2% and  <dig> ± 5%, respectively after  <dig> h . 4-meo-cinnamaldehyde was the only other cinnamaldehyde derivative to cause a significant decrease in protease activity  . a time dependent inhibition of pigment production was found for cinnamaldehyde and 2-no2-cinnamaldehyde. after  <dig> h, inhibition in pigment production was  <dig> ± 7% and  <dig> ± 2% for cinnamaldehyde and 2-no2-cinnamaldehyde . in contrast, none of the other cinnamaldehyde derivatives were able to significantly reduce pigment production after  <dig> h . previously, it was shown that several virulence factors in vibrio anguillarum, including pigment and protease production, were regulated by qs. it was found that a mutation in vant  resulted in a significant decrease in total protease activity due to loss of expression of the metalloprotease empa  <cit> . loss of protease activity could have several implications for the virulence of vibrio spp. the protease vvp of vibrio vulnificus, which is homologous to empa, is thought to play an essential role in the colonisation of mucosal surfaces  <cit> . in addition, empa protease from vibrio anguillarum is important for virulence during infection of the atlantic salmon  and contributes to hemorrhagic skin damage  <cit> . several other phenotypes, including pigment production, were also found to be affected in a vibrio anguillarum vant mutant  <cit> .

effect of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde derivatives on biofilm formation
cinnamaldehyde was previously shown to inhibit escherichia coli biofilms. since cinnamaldehyde significantly reduced swimming motility in escherichia coli it was hypothesized that reduced biofilm formation could be explained in part by an inability of the strain to reach the substratum  <cit> . however it should be noticed that no link with qs was described and cinnamaldehyde was used in high concentrations . cinnamaldehyde and some cinnamaldehyde derivatives decreased biofilm formation in vibrio anguillarum lmg  <dig> and vibrio vulnificus lmg  <dig> . cinnamaldehyde reduced total biomass  with  <dig> ± 7% and  <dig> ± 13% in vibrio anguillarum lmg  <dig> and vibrio vulnificus lmg  <dig>  respectively. 2-no2-cinnamaldehyde and 4-meo-cinnamaldehyde resulted in a significant decrease in biomass of vibrio anguillarum lmg  <dig> . no effect of cinnamaldehyde derivatives on vibrio vulnificus lmg  <dig> biomass was observed . the cell-viability assay revealed no significant decrease in the number of metabolically active cells in vibrio anguillarum lmg  <dig> and vibrio vulnificus lmg  <dig> biofilm following treatment. in summary, cinnamaldehyde has an effect on total biofilm biomass but not on the number of viable cells. this suggests that cinnamaldehyde may have an effect on the production and/or accumulation of the exopolysaccharide  matrix . to investigate this hypothesis, eps was stained using calcofluor white. calcofluor white is a fluorescent dye which binds β1– <dig> and β1– <dig> carbohydrate linkages and which has been used to study eps in a variety of organisms  <cit> . the staining was carried out on biofilms treated with cinnamaldehyde as this compound overall had most effect on biofilm biomass as assessed using cv. the use of cinnamaldehyde resulted in a lower fluorescent signal compared to an untreated control . these data support the hypothesis that the effect of cinnamaldehyde on biofilm formation can be explained by reduced eps production and/or accumulation.

protection of artemia from vibrio harveyi
for many pathogenic vibrio spp., the production of protease, pigment and their capacity to form biofilms contribute to their virulence  <cit> . we investigated the ability of cinnamaldehyde and 2-no2-cinnamaldehyde, the two most active inhibitors, to protect artemia shrimp against the virulent vibrio harveyi bb <dig> strain. to this end, we followed the survival of artemia after exposure to vibrio harveyi bb <dig>  with and without addition of compounds . cinnamaldehyde and 2-no2-cinnamaldehyde alone had no effects on artemia shrimp . as expected, high mortality rates were observed when exposing artemia to vibrio harveyi bb <dig>  in contrast, cinnamaldehyde and 2-no2-cinnamaldehyde were able to completely protect artemia against virulent vibrio harveyi bb <dig> when used at concentrations of  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm . at these concentrations, there was no effect on the growth of vibrio harveyi bb <dig>  ruling out that the protective effect of cinnamaldehyde and 2-no2-cinnamaldehyde was due to inhibition of the bacterial pathogen. these results suggest that cinnamaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde derivatives may be useful as antipathogenic compounds.

effect of cinnamaldehyde on the starvation response
the effect of cinnamaldehyde on the starvation response of vibrio vulnificus lmg  <dig> and vibrio anguillarum lmg  <dig> was investigated. in the control experiment no decrease in the number of culturable cells after  <dig> h of starvation was observed . upon treatment with cinnamaldehyde, however, cell numbers were significantly reduced  . after  <dig> h, cell numbers were even further reduced in the cinnamaldehyde treated cultures , while there was only a  <dig> ± 5% and  <dig> ± 28% reduction in number of culturable cells in the control for vibrio vulnificus lmg  <dig> and vibrio anguillarum lmg  <dig>  respectively. bacteria are known for their ability to survive and respond to changes in their surroundings. one of these adaptations is the starvation response found in many marine bacteria. vibrio spp. are known to survive for a long time without the addition of supplemental nutrition and this starvation response allows cells to survive adverse conditions. qs is thought to play a role in this response to stress conditions  <cit> . our data indicate that inhibition of ai- <dig> based qs suppresses the starvation response and makes cells more susceptible to starvation-associated stress conditions. this is in agreement with a previously published study  <cit>  in which starvation survival in vibrio vulnificus was reduced by mutation of luxr in the qs system and by halogenated furanones.

effect of cinnamaldehyde on antibiotic susceptibility
we have examined the association between qs and antibiotic susceptibility in two vibrio spp. two antibiotics with a different mode of action were chosen. chloramphenicol, previously used as prophylactic in aquaculture, targets the 50s ribosomal subunit  <cit> . doxycycline, an antibiotic targeting the 30s ribosomal subunit, is the recommended antibiotic therapy for vibrio vulnificus infections  <cit> . vibrio vulnificus lmg  <dig> showed an increased antibiotic susceptibility when treated with cinnamaldehyde . this difference was most pronounced when using chloramphenicol. in contrast, in vibrio anguillarum lmg  <dig>  no differences were observed between cinnamaldehyde treatment and control . previously, it was found that qs inhibition could alter the susceptibility of a strain towards antimicrobial agents. vibrio cholerae strains with various mutations in the ai- <dig> signal transduction system appeared to be more sensitive to treatment with hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . similarly, a streptococcus anginosus luxs mutant was found to be more susceptible towards ampicillin and erythromycin than the wild type strain  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
cinnamaldehyde and several derivatives were shown to interfere with ai- <dig> based qs by decreasing the ability of luxr to bind to its target promoter sequence. these compounds, used in sub-inhibitory concentrations, did not only affect in vitro the production of multiple virulence factors and biofilm formation, but also reduced in vivo the mortality of artemia shrimp exposed to vibrio harveyi bb <dig>  in addition, cinnamaldehyde reduced the ability to cope with stress factors like starvation and exposure to antibiotics. our results indicate that cinnamaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde derivatives are potentially useful antipathogenic lead compounds for treatment of vibriosis.
