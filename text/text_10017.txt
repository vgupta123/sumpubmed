BACKGROUND
the marine free-living cyanobacterium prochlorococcus is the most abundant autotroph on our planet, yet its cell size and genome are nearly the smallest among the oxygenic phototrophs  <cit> . this bacterium geographically distributes throughout tropical and subtropical open seas, thriving particularly in oligotrophic regions  <cit> . the prochlorococcus genus mainly consists of high-light  and low-light  ecotypes. these ecotypes display different vertical niche partitioning in water columns with stratified light and nutrient distributions  <cit> .

genome streamlining is an intriguing phenomenon that has long been observed in prochlorococcus lineages  <cit> . kettler et al. defined approximately  <dig> genes as the core genome of prochlorococcus based on a systemic analysis of  <dig> genome sequences of this clade, whereas more than  <dig> genes were estimated within the flexible genome  <cit> . although prochlorococcus ecotype differentiation associated with flexible genome streamlining has been extensively studied  <cit> , the mechanism in which the prochlorococcus core genome is consistently maintained is unknown. it is hypothesized that core genes are more essential to a lineage than flexible genes  <cit> , and thus, functional necessity dictates core genome stabilization. however, a growing body of evidences suggests that gene expression level is another important and independent predictor of molecular evolution from prokaryote to eukaryote  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that prochlorococcus genome stabilization and streamlining is not only influenced by functional gene necessity, and further transcriptome analyses are required to explain the genome evolution within this genus. interestingly, the subspecies prochlorococcus med <dig> has an increased rate of protein evolution and a remarkably reduced genome  <cit> . these characteristics make it an ideal model organism for examining the evolutionary factors that influence genome evolution.

rna-seq is a high-throughput sequencing technique that has been widely used for transcriptome profiling  <cit> . it allows for the identification of operons, untranslated regions , novel genes, and non-coding rnas   <cit> . in order to determine the global features of med <dig> transcriptome and provide insight for core genome stabilization at the angle of gene expression, we applied rna-seq to ten med <dig> samples grown on pro <dig> medium and artificial medium for prochlorococcus   <cit>  and collected throughout its life cycle . we identified the operon structure and utrs, as well as novel opening reading frames  and ncrnas. by analyzing gene expression data, we infer that gene expression, gene necessity, and mrna stability influence prochlorococcus med <dig> core genome stabilization.

RESULTS
transcriptome structure of prochlorococcus med4
the illumina high-throughput sequencing  protocols were applied to ten prochlorococcus med <dig> samples cultured in pro <dig> and amp . altogether,  <dig>  million 90-bp pair-end reads were generated, and approximately  <dig>  million pair-end reads  were perfectly mapped to the genome . collectively,  <dig> % of the med <dig> genome was transcribed for at least one growth condition, and  <dig> % of the genome was transcribed in all conditions. the transcribed regions might be larger if more growth conditions are tested. the genome expression cut-off was defined as the coverage of the tenth percentile of the lowest expressed genome regions  <cit>  . in contrast,  <dig> % of  <dig> coding-sequence  genes were expressed in at least one growth condition, and  <dig> % were expressed in all conditions. gene expression cut-off was defined as the mean rpkm  of the ten percentages of the lowest expressed gene regions .

the rna-seq reads mapping allow us to globally identify transcripts’ boundaries and adjacent gene regions  <cit> . to obtain a genome-wide operon map, a putative operon was characterized if it was repeatedly observed in at least three samples . using this criterion,  <dig> % of all genes were assigned to  <dig> primary operons , representing the first operon map of prochlorococcus based on experimental data. the operon map completely or partially shared  <dig> % of operon genes within predicted operons identified by the prokaryotic operon database  <cit> . the remaining operons comprised many new genes recently predicted by kettler et al. and steglich et al. <cit>  . the majority of the operons  identified in this study were composed of two genes. the largest operon identified was a ribosomal protein operon containing  <dig> genes, and this was consistent with previously published observation made by steglich et al. <cit> . furthermore, those extensively characterized operons, such as kaibc circadian clock  <cit> , two-component system phorb <cit> , photosystem i core apparatus psaab <cit> , and carboxysome shell proteins cso cluster  <cit> , were also included in the operon map .

utrs were predicted by identifying the operons’ boundaries. these were defined as sharp declines in coverage of the regions upstream or downstream of the start or stop codons, respectively . accordingly,  <dig> 5’utrs were identified and the median utr length was approximately  <dig> nucleotides  . although most 5’utrs were small and typically similar to many other bacterial  <cit> ,  <dig> % of the 5’utrs identified were longer than  <dig> nt. long 5’utr, particularly in prokaryotes, may contain cis-regulation element such as the shine-dalgarno  sequence, which mediates mrna translational efficiency. potential rna elements  were scanned using the rfam  <cit> , but no conserved elements were identified. these observations are in agreement with previous work  <cit>  and suggest prochlorococcus may contain unknown cis-regulatory sequences, like targets for ncrnas.

we also identified  <dig> 3’utrs . when these sequences  were searched by the arnold  <cit> , only  <dig> significant termination signals were identified . however, the high proportion  of long 3’utrs  suggests that these regions may have other important roles that require further exploration.

to identify new orfs and ncrnas, we analyzed the intergenic regions determined by current gene annotation . seven transcript units were identified with high confidence, including two orfs and five ncrnas . the two orfs were conserved hypothetical proteins present in related subspecies such as p. marinus mit <dig>  p. marinus w <dig>  and p. marinus mit <dig>  all five identified ncrnas were expressed in at least eight conditions . in particular, tibyfr <dig> was the highest expressed ncrna among five predicted ncrnas, whereas tibyfr <dig> consistently showed the highest abundance under the light–dark conditions  <cit> . this suggests that tibyfr <dig> and tibyfr <dig> expression level may be influenced by changes in light.

highly expressed genes were overrepresented in the core genome but not in the flexible genome
using genome-wide expression data, we compared gene expression profiles between the med <dig> core and flexible genomes  <cit> . up to  <dig> % of the  <dig> genes in the core genome were expressed, and this was significantly higher than  <dig> % of the genes expressed in the flexible genome . furthermore, a moderate but significant correlation was observed between the gene expression levels  and corresponding protein nonsynonymous substitution rates  . this observation that higher expressed genes evolve slowly, which has been observed in various organisms  <cit> , might also be true in prochlorococcus med <dig> 

to uncover the variations of gene expression and molecular conservation, all cds genes were classified into five subclasses based on expression level. briefly, first, we assumed that at a certain time point, some transcripts are highly expressed, and some are lowly expressed or not even transcribed. then, excluding the non-expressed genes, we used quartation to classify all expressed genes to three expression level groups: the genes with the top 25% rpkm in a sample were defined as highly expressed genes , the lowest 25% were classified to lowly expressed genes , and the median group was defined as moderately expressed genes . thus, if we trace one gene’s expression level across multiple samples, it might be constantly classified into heg, meg, leg, or neg , which were collectively designated constantly expressed genes ; otherwise, it was defined as variably expressed gene .

all med <dig> cds genes were classified into five subgroups . heg had a significantly lower nonsynonymous substitution rate  than meg or leg , indicating a strong negative correlation between gene expression level and evolutionary rate. intriguingly, ceg subclass had a lower ka than veg , even when heg were excluded from the ceg because of their bias with the lowest evolutionary rate among all expression subclasses .

next, we compared the five gene expression subclasses of the core genome to that of the flexible genome. our analysis clearly indicates that the genes in the heg and meg subclasses were more enriched in the core genome than in the flexible genome . conversely, the core genome had fewer neg and veg than the flexible genome . these data strongly suggest that prochlorococcus med <dig> genes with constant high expression levels evolve slowly, and this concurs with previous findings in other prokaryotes and eukaryotes  <cit> . they also suggest that genes with relatively stable expression are more likely to evolve slowly when compared with veg.

gene expression level and functional necessity independently influence core genome stabilization
it is well established that the core genome contains more indispensible genes that play central metabolic roles  <cit> . this results in a lower mutation rate than in the flexible genome. to define essential genes, we searched for homologs of all med <dig> coding genes in the database of essential genes , a database that collects all indispensible genes measured in laboratory by far  <cit> . using blastx , we found homologs for  <dig> med <dig> coding genes. a total of  <dig> genes were distributed in the core genome, representing  <dig> % of core genes. this was a significantly higher proportion of genes than those distributed in the flexible genome . these data support the hypothesis that core genes are responsible for central cell metabolism in prochlorococcus.

we also compared the expression levels of the core med <dig> genes that had homologs in the deg database  with those genes that did not have any known homologs . heg, leg, and neg had no enrichment for either deg-hit or deg-miss genes . although the meg subclass had a significantly higher rate of deg-hit genes , the mean expression level of the deg-hit genes  was not significantly different from that of the deg-miss genes . therefore, as previous works reported  <cit> , this suggests that essential genes are not necessarily highly expressed and that gene expression levels relatively independently affect sequence evolution in prochlorococcus med <dig> 

we also performed functional enrichment analysis on each gene expression subclass. as most of the genes in the flexible genome have no cog categories  <cit> , we mainly focused on the core genes’ expression subclasses, especially the heg. among these core heg genes, several functional categories were more prominent than others. these included the “c” , “j” , and “o”  categories . these results suggest that these central metabolic functions are among the most conserved throughout the evolution of prochlorococcus lineage. in particular, translational and ribosomal components are generally regarded as the most stable part of genome  <cit> . in addition to ribosomal proteins, photosynthetic apparatus and energy metabolism genes were also overrepresented among the core genome. interestingly, genes involved in protein modification and folding were also stably and highly expressed, suggesting that these genes are under strict constraints similar to those observed for ribosomal and photosynthetic genes.

additionally, category “r”  was slightly enriched in both leg and neg .

varied gene expression in different cellular processes
to investigate gene expression levels during different physiological processes, we compared the average gene expression levels of six important pathways using the ribosomal component as an expression standard because of its universally high expression level  <cit> . six cellular pathways displayed significantly different expression levels . photosynthesis and carbon metabolism pathway genes were expressed at the highest level , and these data were consistent with heg that function in energy production and conversion within the core genome . subsequent enrichment analysis of the expression subclasses showed that heg were overrepresented in both pathways .

intriguingly, hli genes exhibited high expression levels . this may be due to the sustained light condition used in this study. however, heg were not enriched among the hli genes . we infer that is because several genes, such as pmm <dig> and  <dig> , are highly expressed when cells are exposed to high light conditions . on the contrary, pmm <dig>  was slightly transcribed . it may that differentially expressed hli genes protect different cellular components, such as light harvesting antenna and nucleic acids  <cit> .

as expected, phage-related genes displayed the lowest expression levels in this study, as phage infection conditions were not tested. it would be better to have phage infection condition data to analysis these genes expression profiles. for phosphorus and nitrogen acquisition genes, there was no significant enrichment in the four expression subclasses . however, pmm <dig> and pmm <dig>   <cit> , and one ammonium transporter  were highly expressed , suggesting that these proteins play particular roles in phosphorus or nitrogen uptake, respectively.

conserved genes more likely clustered to operon than poorly conserved genes
we identified  <dig> operons  that uniquely belonged to the core genome, whereas the flexible genome harbored only  <dig> operons . based on this observation, we examined whether operon genes were more conserved than non-operon genes. the comparison of nonsynonymous substitution rates indicated that the total operon coding-sequence genes indeed evolve more slowly than non-operon genes . furthermore, operon genes were significantly overrepresented in the core genome but not in the flexible genome . because heg are more conserved in med <dig>  we compared the operon rate  of heg with the other expression subclasses. we found that operons are strikingly enriched in heg and meg . in addition, the distribution of operon size within the core genome when compared with the flexible genome was slightly different. approximately  <dig> %  of operons detected in the core genome harbored two genes, compared with  <dig> %  in the flexible genome . extensive works has reported that essential genes prefer to be in operon  <cit> . we compared the operon rate of deg-hit genes and deg-miss genes. significantly more operonic genes were indeed present in the former gene set . these findings strongly suggest that med <dig> conserved genes are more likely to be co-transcribed and are larger in size.

constantly and abundantly expressed transcripts undergo quick degradation
pál et al. previously reported a weak positive association between the rate of evolution and mrna half-lives in yeast  <cit> . however, the analysis was done by incomplete genome dataset of rna degradation. using a genome-wide mrna half-life dataset  <cit> , we observed a similar but also slight tendency for genes with lower ka to have shorter half-lives . further investigation showed that highly expressed genes were more likely degraded fast . intriguingly, as steglich et al. reported  <cit> , several genes, including amt <dig> , psba , som-1/ <dig> , pcb , and also two hypothetical genes , that were strongly transcribed turnover very slowly . this may attribute to these genes’ specific roles in these growth conditions. despite these exceptions, similar result indicated that highly expressed transcripts had significant shorter half-lives . accordingly, the mrna turnover rate for genes within the core genome was faster than that of the flexible genome . besides for the advantages of rapid recycling nucleotides to adapt to oligotrophic environment  <cit> , fast turnover of heg might also be beneficial for translation fidelity  <cit> , and consequently make the core genome more economical and compatible with cellular physiology.

discussion
prochlorococcus is a typical phototroph whose cellular physiology and transcriptome are comprehensively affected by photoperiod  <cit> . we wondered whether light cycle-influenced gene expression profiles might lead to contradictory conclusions regarding the correlation between gene expression and evolution traits when prochlorococcus is cultured under constant light conditions. therefore, we applied the same method we developed to light–dark expression data generated by rna-seq  <cit> . first, we again observed a significant correlation between gene expression levels and corresponding nonsynonymous substitution rates , and this was confirmed by the comparisons of evolution rates of four expression subclasses . second, constantly expressed genes, particularly heg and meg with lower ka, were most often located within the core genome . third, lowly expressed genes were more likely slowly degraded , and four of seven exceptions described above  retained in this light–dark conditions . the comparisons of gene expression subclasses further indicated constantly and highly expressed transcripts tend to be quickly degraded . interestingly, there was no significant difference between heg and meg , and the same trait was also observed in the correlation between gene expression levels and half-lives when expression level increased to a certain degree the decay rate no longer declined . these observations might be partially caused by specific growth conditions, or alternatively, by the genes’ position in operon because those genes located at 3’-end of operons are less expressed but slower degraded than 5’-end genes  <cit> . therefore, half-lives of the high-operon-rate genes, such as heg and meg , are more likely dependent upon their positions in operons. despite opronic genes’ position, degradation distinction still can be observed in those genes with great difference in expression levels . however, it is not simplistic to figure out what extent the gene position can influence half-life to, and this also deviates from our topic in this study.

although all experimental conditions tested in this study are considered physiologically normal, we also wonder whether environmental stress, such as iron that was studied by thompson and coworkers  <cit> , may affect the correlation between gene expression levels and molecular evolution. first, similar results were observed that highly and constantly expressed genes had lower ka , and they were enriched more within the core genome . second, those genes with constantly high expression level  had short half-lives . nonetheless, all of our observations are in accordance with previous conclusions drawn from normal growth conditions under constant illumination, and this may indicate that gene expression levels have relatively self-contained influence on genome evolution in prochlorococcus med <dig>  but note that the conditions we have tested are actually in the laboratory, the similar study conducted using the cultures in situ will facilitate to further elucidate the core genome stabilization of prochlorococcus.

genes within the flexible genome are subject to relaxed constraints, and these genes can undergo frequent gain and loss in prochlorococcus, leading to isolates differentiation. multiple factors such as an incomplete dna-repair system, relaxed selection, and paralog deletion can contribute to genome reduction  <cit> . however, little is known about factors that affect the molecular evolution of the prochlorococcus core genome. gene expression level has been reported as an independent factor that influences the rate of protein evolution across taxa  <cit> . in this study, we have provided evidences that highly conserved genes were more likely to be abundantly expressed, and highly and constantly expressed genes were distributed more in the core genome than in the flexible genome . selection pressure imposes on those highly expressed genes to minimize the great cost  of corresponding mistranslated or error-folded proteins  <cit> . as the core genes show higher expression levels, these genes accordingly undergo more powerful evolutionary constraints derived from translation and folding  <cit> . because efficient and fast mrna degradation can minimize the use of poor mrna and thus reduce the production of low-quality polypeptides derived from translation errors  <cit> , highly expressed genes are more likely to be quickly degraded. this in turn increases the cellular fitness of abundantly expressed core genes. notably, genes involved in protein folding and turnover were stably and highly expressed . this has also been observed in natural microbial communities revealed by metatranscriptomic data  <cit> . these findings suggest that prochlorococcus invests in protein folding and degradation to ensure protein fidelity, and thus further increases translational robustness.

however, it is reasonable to assume that essential genes are more likely abundantly expressed, thus the core genome that is of high necessity has higher expression level. previous reports have demonstrated the difficulties in accepting this assumption  <cit> . our result also suggests that expression level is relatively independent of gene necessity in prochlorococcus med <dig>  as no significant difference in gene expression levels was observed between genes with conserved essential homologs  and those without homologs  . in terms of which one contributing more than the other, the better model is required in the future.

the gene necessity   <cit>  influences the core genome stabilization because of its essential functions for physiology and metabolism. in particular, we found that energy metabolism, protein synthesis, and protein folding genes were more enriched in heg within the core genome . this implies that these central metabolic pathways lie in the most conserved gene pool across the evolutionary history of prochlorococcus. therefore, by analyzing mrna levels, we were able to reach the same conclusion as those drawn by comparative genomics and protein sequence alignments  <cit> . additionally, operons were more likely distributed in the core genome than in the flexible genome . basically, this distinction might be derived from the higher proportion of essential genes in the core genome . important genes more likely cluster to operons because those central metabolic genes, such as photosynthetic apparatus or ribosome machinery, in the same operon can be beneficially co-regulated and co-transcribed, and  packed to a complex  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we used rna-seq to obtain a blueprint of the transcriptome of prochlorococcus med <dig>  we identified remarkable distinctions in gene expression levels, gene necessity, and mrna turnover between the core and flexible genomes, indicating that they are powerful constraints imposed on core genome stabilization. we hope these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the causes of ecotypic differentiation in the prochlorococcus genus, and offer a new perspective for future investigations of cyanobacterium evolution.
