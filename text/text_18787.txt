BACKGROUND
eph kinases are the largest family of cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases and can be divided into a and b subfamilies according to their sequence homology. the ligands of ephs, ephrins , are also cell surface molecules. efns are divided into a and b subfamilies. efnas are gpi-anchored cell surface proteins and efnbs are transmembrane cell surface proteins. ephs and efns interact promiscuously. epha members mainly interact with efna members, while ephb members mainly interact with efnb members. when ephs and efns interact, signals are transmitted in both directions, i.e., from ephs to efns and from efns to ephs. such bi-directional signalling is called forward and reversed signalling respectively  <cit> .

efnb <dig> is involved in the development and function of the central nervous system  <cit> . it is also essential in bone maintenance and remodelling  <cit> . efnb <dig> expression in platelets contributes to the clotting process  <cit> . its expression on kidney epithelial cells  likely plays a role in glomerular filtration  <cit> . efnb <dig> is involved in intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis  <cit> . we have shown that efnb <dig> forward signalling through their eph receptors can costimulate peripheral t cells in terms of enhancing cytokine production and proliferation in vitro and enhance thymocyte survival  <cit> . to further understand the role of efnb <dig> in t cell development and function, we generated t-cell-specific gene knockout mice. the effects of efnb <dig> on their immune system are presented here.

methods
generation of t cell-specific efnb <dig> gene knockout mice
t cell-specific efnb <dig> gene knockout mice were generated in our laboratory as described  <cit> . first, efnb <dig> exon  <dig> was flanked with loxp sites. these floxed mice were backcrossed to the c57bl/ <dig> background for more than nine generations and then mated with lck-promoter-driven cre transgenic  mice in the c57bl/ <dig> background {strain b <dig> cg-tgi540jxm/j, jackson laboratory, bar harbor, maine, usa} to obtain t cell-specific efnb <dig> gene knockout mice. since efnb <dig> is an x-linked gene, the deletion of an efnb <dig> gene in one allele in males equals the deletion of the gene in two alleles in females. these mice were collectively called efnb1f/f/cre mice for convenience, regardless of gender. floxed males or females without the cre transgene were used as controls and were collectively called efnb1f/f mice.

all mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions and used in accordance with a protocol approved by the institutional animal protection committee of the university of montreal hospital center .

immunofluorescent microscopy
one hundred thousand thymocytes in single cell suspension were applied to glass slides using statspin® cytofuge  at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for  <dig> min and then blocked with pbs containing 10% fbs. cells were then stained with  <dig> μg/ml goat anti-efnb <dig> ab  overnight at 4°c, followed by  <dig>  μg/ml pe-donkey anti-goat igg ab  for  <dig> min. the slides were mounted with prolong® gold antifade reagent  and examined under a carl zeiss microscope using axiovision™ software .

flow cytometry
single cell suspensions from the thymus and spleen were prepared and stained for flow cytometry as described in our previous publications . for intracellular antigen staining, cells were first stained with abs against cell surface antigens fixed with cytofix/cytoperm solution , then stained with ab against intracellular antigens. next, abs were used for flow cytometry as follows: anti-mouse cd <dig> percp ; anti-mouse cd <dig> apc ; anti-mouse cd <dig> apc ; anti-mouse cd <dig> fitc ; anti-mouse thy <dig>  pe ; anti-mouse b <dig> apc-cy™  <dig> ; anti-mouse cd <dig> apc ; anti-mouse cd62l pe ; anti-mouse cd <dig>  fitc ; anti-mouse cd <dig>  percp ; anti-mouse ifn-γ fitc ; anti-mouse il <dig> pe ; anti-mouse il <dig> pe  ; anti-mouse cd <dig> pacific bue ; and anti-mouse foxp <dig> apc  .

t cell activation and proliferation assay
total spleen cells were stimulated with soluble hamster anti-mouse cd <dig> mab  plus rat anti-mouse cd <dig> mab . after  <dig> h culture, cells were stained with pe-rat anti-mouse thy <dig>   and fitc-rat anti-cd <dig>  or anti-cd <dig> mab , and analyzed with 2-color flow cytometry. for t cell proliferation, spleen t cells were purified using easysep® mouse t cell enrichment kit  and cultured in wells coated with hamster anti-mouse cd <dig> mab  alone or hamster anti-mouse cd <dig> mab  plus rat anti-mouse cd <dig> . 3h-thymidine uptake of the cultured cells was measured at  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h after culture, as described in our previous publication  <cit> .

generation of bone marrow chimeras
eight to 10-week-old c57bl/ <dig>  × c57/b <dig> sjl f <dig> mice were irradiated at  <dig>  rads. twenty-four hours later, they received 4x <dig> t cell-depleted bone marrow cells from. efnb1f//f/cre alone or c57/b <dig> sjl and efnb1f//f/cre mice in a 1: <dig> ratio. efnb1f//f mouse bone marrow was used as a control. spleen cells of the recipients were analyzed by flow cytometry  <dig> to  <dig> weeks following the bone marrow transplantation .

in vitro th <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig> and treg polarization
th <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig> and treg populations were polarized from naïve cd4+ t cells that were isolated from pooled splenocytes and lymph node cells using naïve cd4+ t cells isolation kits . purity of the naïve cd4+ cells was routinely greater than 95%. purified naïve t cells  were mixed with t cell-depleted irradiated  c57bl/ <dig> feeder splenocytes , and cultured in 96-well plates in rpmi medium  <dig> containing 10% fcs,  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin,  <dig> units/ml penicillin g, 1× nonessential amino acids,  <dig> μm sodium pyruvate,  <dig>  μm β-mercaptoethanol, and  <dig> μg/ml soluble hamster anti-cd3ε mab . for th <dig> polarization, rmil- <dig>  and rat anti-il- <dig> mab  were added to the culture. for th <dig> polarization, rmil- <dig> , rat anti-il- <dig> mab  and rat anti-ifn-γ mab  were added. for th <dig> polarization, cultures were supplemented with recombinant mouse il- <dig> , recombinant human tgf-β <dig> , and rat anti-il- <dig> mab and rat-anti-ifn-γmab . for treg polarization, recombinant human tgf-β <dig>  and rat anti-il- <dig> and rat anti-ifn-γmab  were added to the culture. recombinant cytokines and mab against cytokines were all from r & d systems . five days after culture,  <dig> nm of pma,  <dig> ng/ml of ionomycin, and protein transport inhibitor bd golgistop™  were added for the last four hours of culture. cells were harvested and stained for intracellular cytokines or foxp <dig> followed by flow cytometry analysis.

RESULTS
efnb <dig> deletion in t cells
to confirm the deletion of efnb <dig> in the t cell compartment, we conducted an immunofluorescence study on thymocytes using thy <dig>  and efnb <dig> double staining. control thy <dig> + thymocytes  expressed efnb <dig>  , while efnb <dig> was not detectable in thy <dig> + thymocytes from efnb1f/f/cre mice . the deletion of efnb <dig> was confirmed in mature spleen t cells by flow cytometry analysis . these results demonstrated that efnb <dig> was indeed deleted in the t-linage cells in ko mice.

cellularity and cell subpopulations in the thymus and spleen of efnb1f/f/cre mice
there was no gross morphological difference between efnb1f/f/cre and efnb1f/f thymi. they were of similar weight and cellularity, as shown in figures  <dig>  thymocytes from efnb1f/f/cre mice were analyzed by flow cytometry for different cell populations. representative histograms are shown in figure 2b, and 2bar graphs in figure 2c summarize the results of  <dig> independent experiments. efnb1f/f/cre and efnb1f/f mice had comparable percentages of cd4cd <dig> double positive , cd <dig> single positive , and cd <dig> sp thymocytes. conversely, there was a moderate but significant increase in cd4cd <dig> double negative  thymocytes in efnb1f/f/cre mice compared to efnb1f/f mice. further analysis of dn thymocytes revealed that the augmented percentage of dn was due to the heightened percentage of dn <dig> stage cells in efnb1f/f/cre mice .

the spleen weight and cellularity of efnb1f/f/cre mice showed no significant difference compared to controls  after analyzing  <dig> pairs of mice. different spleen cell populations were assessed by flow cytometry. histograms from representative experiments are shown in figures 3c and 3d, and a summary of results from  <dig> independent experiments are illustrated as bar graphs in figure 3e. t and b cell populations in the efnb1f/f/cre spleens were comparable to those of efnb1f/f spleens . no apparent difference was found in the ratios of cd <dig> and cd <dig> cells between ko and control spleens . we next examined whether there is any change of naive versus memory population in efnb <dig> ko t cell. as shown in 3e, no difference was observed in the percentage of cd44locd62lhi efnb1f/f/cre naïve cd <dig> t cells and cd44hicd62llo efnb <dig> ko memory cd <dig> t cells compared with the littermate control cd <dig> t cells in the spleen.

to determine the requirement for efnb <dig> in early t cell development and t cell proliferation, we intraveneously transferred bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors from efnb1f/f/cre or efnb1f/f mice into lethally irradiated b <dig> sjl cd <dig>  × c57bl/ <dig> cd <dig>  f <dig> hosts. in those single chimeras, the donor contribution  was about 90%. t-cell depleted bone marrow cells from efnb1f/f/cre or efnb1f/f generated similar sized pool of peripheral t cells . we further examined t cell production of efnb1f/f/cre or efnb1f/f bone marrow progenitors in competitive repopulation experiment. to this end, we used a model of whole body irradiation  followed by bone marrow transplantation , using b <dig> sjl bone marrow cells to compete with efnb1f/f/cre or efnb1f/f bone marrow cells. in this model, cd <dig>  single positive cells were derived from competitor b <dig> sjl bone marrow cells; cd <dig>  single positive cells were derived from efnb1f/f/cre or efnb1f/f bone marrow cells; and cd <dig> /cd <dig>  double positive cells were derived from residual recipient bone marrow cells and peripheral cells. as shown in figure 4b, there was similar amount of the spleen cells derived from donor bone marrow cells  and competitor b <dig> sjl bone marrow cells  no matter whether the donor bone marrow cells derived from efnb1f/f/cre or efnb1f/f mice. while gated on cd <dig>  single positive cells, no significant differences were found in the repopulated spleen t cells of the recipients received bone marrow cells from mixture of efnb1f/f/cre and b <dig> sjl mice compared with that of the recipients received bone marrow cells from mixture of control efnb1f/f and b <dig> sjl mice. this indicates that the efnb1f/f/cre bone marrow cells were comparable to the efnb1f/f control bone marrow cells in their capacity to compete with b <dig> sjl bone marrow cells to develop and expand in the void niche created by irradiation. taken together, the results show that t cell development was minimally affected in the absence of efnb <dig> 

in vitro activation and proliferation of efnb1f/f/cre t cells were not compromised
next, we investigated the function of peripheral efnb1f/f/cre t cells in terms of activation and proliferation. spleen t cells were purified by negative selection using magnetic beads; the purified cells contained more than 95% cd <dig> positive cells. they were cultured in wells coated with anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig>  after overnight culture, they were analyzed for the expression of activation markers such as cd <dig> and cd <dig>  more than 95% of the t cells from efnb1f/f/cre mice upregulated their cd <dig> and cd <dig> expression within  <dig> h; such upregulation was comparable to that of t cells from efnb1f/f mice . meanwhile, no significant change of efnb <dig> expression was noted between resting and activated t cells from efnb1f/f mice .

we then examined proliferation of t cells from efnb1f/f/cre mice. purified spleen t cells were cultured in wells coated with anti-cd <dig> mab , or anti-cd <dig> plus anti-cd <dig> mab ; and their proliferation was determined at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h according to3h-thymidine uptake. a summary of three independent experiments is illustrated in figures 4b and 4c. overall, efnb1f/f/cre t cells showed no compromise in their ability to proliferate upon solid phase anti-cd <dig> mab  or anti-cd <dig> plus anti-cd <dig> mab  stimulation. of importance, anti-cd <dig> ab concentration  was higher in wells coated with anti-cd <dig> ab alone, compared to the concentration used in wells coated with anti-cd <dig> plus anti-cd <dig> abs. this shows that the maximal proliferation under these two conditions was similar.

in vitro differentiation of efnb1f/f/cre t cells
since efnb1f/f/cre t cells showed no abnormality in activation and proliferation, we next assessed whether they could properly differentiate into different functional subpopulations. spleen naive cd <dig> t cells from efnb1f/f/cre and control efnb1f/f mice were cultured under conditions favouring the development of th <dig> , th <dig> , th <dig>  and treg  cells. after optimal durations of culture for each type of cell, the cells were collected and analyzed for their intracellular ifn-γ, il <dig>  il <dig> and foxp <dig> content by flow cytometry. after differentiation, as shown in figures 6a-6d, efnb1f/f/cre and efnb1f/f cd <dig> cells were comparable in their percentage of intracellular ifn-γ+, il4+, il17+ and foxp3+ cells. this indicates that efnb1f/f/cre cd <dig> cells are capable of normal differentiation into th <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig> and treg cells.

discussion
we investigated t cell development in mice with t cell-specific deletion of efnb <dig>  results show that in the absence of efnb <dig>  the thymus and spleen showed mostly normal subpopulations of t cell origin. in single chimeras and competitive chimaeras, the efnb1f/f/cre bone marrow cells demonstrated comparable t cell development as the control efnb1f/f bone marrow cells. moreover, mature t cells had no apparent defects in their activation and proliferation or in their ability to differentiate into functional th <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig> and treg cells.

previous in vitro studies using foetal thymus organ culture have shown that recombinant efnb <dig> protein is capable of influencing t cell development and enhancing thymocyte survival  <cit> . in another study  <cit> , solid phase efnb <dig> was shown to increase mature t cell response to tcr stimulation. how do we reconcile these observations with the present findings that efnb <dig> deletion showed no apparent impact on t cell development and mature t cell function? as mentioned in the introduction, efnb <dig> promiscuously interacts with multiple ephb family members such as ephb <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  and b <dig>  as well as with a few epha family members such as epha <dig> and epha <dig>  when soluble efnb <dig> is introduced into thymus organ culture, it not only blocks the interaction of multiple ephs with efnb <dig>  but also likely interferes with interactions between those ephs and other efn members. when efnb <dig> is placed on solid phase, it will noticeably trigger signalling of multiple ephs. such effects cannot be achieved by simple efnb <dig> deletion. in the absence of efnb <dig>  its forward signalling to other eph molecules and its reverse signalling are likely compensated by other efns.

the absence of a demonstrated phenotype in t cell development and function following efnb <dig> deletion does not prove that this molecule is unimportant. on the contrary, this observation suggests an essential importance of efnb <dig>  it can be argued that the role of efnb <dig> in the t cell compartment is so essential, that any accidental mutation could lead to disastrous consequences. as a counter measure to prevent such disasters from occurring, through evolution, we have developed highly redundant eph and efn systems, as well as promiscuous interactions between eph and efn members. with such a system, any aberrant mutation that occurs to certain eph or efn members will be safely compensated by others in such a way as to guarantee their normal function in the t cell compartment. it is further inferred that the true importance of efns can only be revealed if a deletion of multiple efn family members occurs at the same time. through our studies on t cell-specific deletion of both efnb <dig> and efnb <dig> in mice  <cit> ), we found that in the absence of both efnb <dig> and efnb <dig>  there was compromised αβt cell development in the thymus along with abnormal thymic structure. the efnb1/efnb <dig> ko t cells significantly failed to compete with normal t cells during homeostatic expansion in irradiated recipients. efnb1/efnb <dig> double ko t cells were significantly inferior to normal t cells in their ability to differentiate into th <dig> and th <dig> cells. such a handicap resulted in compromised in vivo t cell-mediated immune responses such as allograft rejection and anti-virus immunity. these results confirm the critical role of efnb <dig> in t cell development and function. however, this role was not observed in the efnb <dig> single ko mice used in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
to conclude, we are the first to have carried out an analysis of roles of t cell development and function in the mice with conditional efnb <dig> deletion in the t cell compartment, though the effect of the single efnb <dig> ko appears to be minimal. our results suggest that the function of efnb <dig> in the t cell compartment could be compensated by other members of the efn family, and that such redundancy safeguards the pivotal roles of efnb in t cell immunity. additional studies on efnb family, i.e. efnb <dig>  efnb <dig> and efnb <dig>  double or even triple null mutated mice to investigate t cell development and function are warranted to confirm such indications.
