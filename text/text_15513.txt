BACKGROUND
due to their ability to alternate between sexual and parthenogenetic  modes of reproduction, their wing polyphenism and the complex relationship between their primary and secondary endosymbiotic bacteria, aphids have become an increasingly popular insect model for genomic, epigenetic, ecological, developmental and evolutionary studies. complete genome sequences have become available for these insects, starting with the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum  <cit> . moreover, the ability to generate a repertoire of variants with distinct behavioral and physiological traits within clonal  reproduction plays an important role in epigenetic studies  <cit> .

the pea aphid hosts different types of endosymbiotic bacteria within bacteriocytes that help it survive and adapt to new environmental conditions and habitats. embryonic aphids acquire endosymbionts from their mothers before birth  via a vertical-transfer mechanism  <cit> . the primary endosymbiotic bacterium  engages in obligate symbiosis with a. pisum , expressing crucial genes for the biosynthesis of essential amino acids ; it also plays a role in aphid growth and reproduction . due to its long host adaptation and suitability, the b. aphidicola genome is remarkably stable. there does not appear to have been any chromosome rearrangements or new gene acquisitions in the last  <dig> to  <dig> million years. the b. aphidicola genome is also characterized by a highly conserved gene order and is drastically reduced in size  <cit> , contains only essential genes, that is, minimal regulatory proteins and almost no mobile elements. therefore, it is no longer a source of new functional genes for adaptation of its host  <cit> . in contrast, the secondary endosymbionts are facultative bacteria that can provide the aphid host with resistance against fungal pathogens and parasites  <cit> , heat adaptation  <cit> , host-plant specialization  <cit> , manipulation of wing polyphenism under crowded conditions  <cit> , and delayed sexual development  <cit> . these secondary endosymbionts might induce morphological changes such as green pigmentation  <cit>  and complete the nutritional role of the primary endosymbiont .

in contrast to the primary endosymbiont, the secondary endosymbionts usually contain large genomes, sometimes with phages and mobile elements, and exhibit higher rates of genetic recombination and mutation  <cit> . for example, genomes of regiella species, a known secondary endosymbiont, are similar in size to those of free-living bacteria, harbor active phages and plasmids, contain mobile elements and exhibit gene rearrangements  <cit> .

the plasticity of the bacterial genome contributes to these microbes’ fascinating adaptation to various ecological niches and dramatic changes in the environment. a significant portion of the variability of the bacterial genome is due to transposable dna elements  <cit> , transposon movement, transposases, and accessory genes taken from hosts  <cit> , accompanied by the introduction of external chromosomal dna  into the bacterium’s genome  <cit> . these genomic changes play a crucial role in generating a broad spectrum of phenotypes  <cit>  and may be associated with the adaptation of bacteria to their host-dependent lifestyle  <cit> .

a selection process for individual aphids adapted to a colder environment was carried out in our laboratory. this process generated two pea aphid variants: those exhibiting the typical orange pigmentation under optimal conditions  and those with unique green abdomen pigmentation at colder temperatures   <cit> .

to date, there have been no reports on how endosymbionts might affect the epigenetic state  of aphid genomes. the aim of this study was to investigate the role of endosymbionts in the phenotypic adaptation of aphids to unfavorable temperature conditions. we hypothesized that selection of a particular strain of secondary endosymbiont and genome modifications such as adenine methylation might contribute to the adaptation of the selected aphid variant and cause phenotypic changes.

RESULTS
selection of an aphid variant with a unique pigmentation
in a previous study, selection for cold adaptation was performed by keeping ten orange adult aphids at 10°c for two days. after five months of this selection, we had obtained a viable and robust colony of green variants. to stabilize the cold-induced green variants, the selection pressure was increased in two steps:  the aphid population was propagated at 9°c for 1 year and  the temperature was then lowered to 8°c for continuous propagation .figure  <dig> 
selection process used to generate the
green
variant. five to  <dig> orange adult acyrthosiphon pisum  were placed on vicia faba plants kept at 10°c. the aphid mothers were removed after 2 days, leaving the descendants. this process was repeated until a stable population emerged with a green phenotype . the original orange offspring did not reach maturation under these conditions. the population of cold-selected aphids with the green phenotype was propagated at 9°c for an additional year and then transferred to 8°c for continuous propagation .



the emerged green variants of a. pisum were characterized by a longer life cycle and slightly bigger bodies during the adult stage, with a heavier average weight . the green phenotype was heritable and robust when the aphids were kept at 8–10°c . reversibility of the green phenotype back to orange was observed for all of the progeny without mortality when green mothers were placed back at 22°c. the emerged progeny were immediately orange with no process of phenotypic selection. these results showed unambiguously that, at 22°c, the pigments responsible for the green pigmentation are no longer synthesized and/or the corresponding enzymes are not induced. genetic selection was observed during the passage from 22°c to 10°c and during the continued propagation at 9°c, and was maintained at 8°c. the enzymatic activity responsible for the change in color was inhibited when aphids were placed back at 22°c.

adenine methylation at the gatc sites of the secondary endosymbiont is temperature-dependent
six fragments were selected  from the adenine-methylated amplification procedure . blast analyses of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the six fragments did not reveal any match to the genomes of the a. pisum aphid or the primary endosymbiont b. aphidicola. however, the results indicated that the sequences belong to the pea aphid facultative endosymbiont r. insecticola or other potential endosymbionts, such as those belonging to the yersinia genus—well-known facultative endosymbionts of mealybugs   <cit>  that were also detected in the blast analyses .figure  <dig> 
isolation of methyladenine genomic fragments using methyl-sensitive restriction enzymes, followed by pcr amplification. dna fragments containing methylated adenines were isolated from samples of total genomic dna of a. pisum using the methylation-site-specific restriction enzyme dpni, adaptor ligation and the methyl-sensitive restriction enzyme dpnii. this was followed by pcr amplification as described by steensel and henikoff  <cit> . the resulting pcr products were cloned and sequenced.



the a <dig> fragment encoded a hypothetical r. insecticola protein with a high level of sequence similarity to the transposase of microcystis aeruginosa and the is <dig> transposase of nostoc punctiforme. further blast-x analysis of the a <dig> fragment revealed a conserved transposase domain within the sequence . the a <dig> and a <dig> fragments matched hypothetical proteins belonging to the genera regiella and yersinia. the a <dig> fragment was highly similar to the secg subunit of a translocase involved in protein export. like the a <dig> fragment , the a <dig> fragment was also found to be highly similar to enzyme involved in dna rearrangement in the endosymbionts , the helicase gene. the a <dig> helicase was identified as highly conserved among bacterial species with 94%; 78% and 74% shared amino acid identity with r. insecticola, y. enterocolitica and salmonella enterica, respectively.

validation of adenine methylation at the gatc sites within the transposase gene
to confirm the variability of adenine methylation between orange and green variants, fragments a <dig> and a <dig> were selected for further analysis. based on the nucleotide sequence of a <dig> in the a. pisum est database , three putative gatc sites of potential adenine methylation were identified within and upstream of the original a <dig> sequence . the a <dig> fragment  was used in a subsequent comparative study of the green and orange aphid variants.

genomic dna  was purified from orange and green adult aphids  and subjected to pre-digestion with ecori . each gdna sample was divided into three subsamples and subjected to a further dam digestion series with the two restriction enzymes dpni and dpnii, separately and in combination. the digested gdna served as a template for two pcr amplifications carried out using two primer pairs: a1f <dig>  a1r <dig> , and a1f <dig>  a1r <dig>  which flank the selected adenine-methylation site .figure  <dig>

for all  <dig> of the examined aphids , positive amplification was detected when the a1f <dig> and a1r <dig> primers were used in the pcr . however, no amplicons were detected when the primers a1f <dig> and a1r <dig> were used together with the dpni-digested gdna from  <dig> of the green aphids, and medium to low amplicon levels were detected for the other  <dig>  amplification was detected in all of the tested orange aphids: a high level of amplicons for  <dig> of these aphids and a medium level of amplicons for the other  <dig>  for the samples subjected to dpnii digestion, strong amplification was detected among the samples from green aphids, whereas low to zero amplification was observed among the samples from orange aphids . moreover, no differences were detected between the winged and wingless orange and green aphids . the pattern of adenine methylation was also examined for two additional gatc sites  clustered upstream of the transposase gene in most of the examined aphids . the differences observed in amplification intensity within the a1m1–a1m <dig> sites in the two variants were not influenced by the transposase transcript levels . based on the dam methylation amplification results, a clear pattern was detected that could be associated to the differences between the two aphid variants. however, to understand the causality and the mechanism involved, further study is required.table  <dig>

a digoxigenin  probe was used in dot-spot hybridization experiments to verify the presence of the a <dig> fragment  in gdna obtained from a. pisum and myzus persicae. the a <dig> dig probe reacted specifically with the gdna extracted from both orange and green variants of a. pisum, and failed to react with the gdna of m. persicae .

genome rearrangement by transposase gene
two techniques—southern blot and genome walking—were adopted to confirm the differential genomic pattern mediated by the secondary endosymbiont transposase. the transposase assumed to be involved in genome rearrangement events leading to the establishment of new a. pisum variants.

a differential amplification pattern was observed upon comparison of the two a. pisum variants using transposase-specific primers  combined with a random hexamer primer  . additional amplicons were detected in the green variant as compared to the orange variant , demonstrating the possibility of transposase movement to a new location in the endosymbiont genome. for further validation, two additional pcrs were performed: first, with forward and reverse random hexamer primers , which gave a negative result ; second, with increased annealing temperature allowing for better specificity, and resulting in enhancement of the variation . additional distinction between the two a. pisum variants was obtained by southern blot analysis using digested gdna from the two variants and a specific probe for the transposase. the hybridization pattern in the orange variant was located on fragments with relatively higher molecular weight relative to the green variant .

validation of adenine methylation at gatc sites within the helicase gene

discussion
selection of aphids toward cold adaptation, as reported in a previous study  <cit> , allowed us to obtain a viable and robust colony of a. pisum with green abdomen morphology  at 8–10°c  <cit> . the physiological changes induced by cold temperature were correlated with dramatic variations in cuticular proteins expression  <cit> . variation in cuticle pigmentation has been linked to the lateral transfer of carotenoid production genes from fungi to their aphid hosts  <cit> . extensive comparisons of the carotene metabolism of three a. pisum variants that differ in their cuticle pigmentation have been made  <cit> .

the heritability of the green phenotype at 8–10°c  <cit> , and the higher adenine methylation rates within the transposase and helicase genes , suggest the existence of a coincidental double mechanism: strain selection and the regulation of new active genes by adenine methylation.

the combinatorial effects of a few thousand secondary endosymbionts in a limited number of bacteriocytes constitute an ideal mechanism for lateral gene transfer, allowing selection and amplification of singular rearranged genomes  <cit> . this might support the assumption that the screening and selection process described by dombrovsky et al.  <cit>  recruited genes of endosymbiotic bacteria that are involved in host adaptation. these gene acquisitions, mediated by the temperature-dependent adenine methylation, might contribute to the ‘epigenetic’ regulation of unknown genes within the bacteria or the host genome.

in this study, we investigated the role of adenine methylation as an adaptive “on–off switch”  <cit>  in endosymbiont bacteria, and whether this methylation is environmentally regulated in aphid endosymbionts and might thus be involved in the transition between orange and green phenotypes. methylation at the n- <dig> position of adenine has been reported to be involved in many biological activities, from the control of chromosome replication and mismatch repair  <cit>  to the regulation of transcription, gene expression and virulence  <cit>  and triggering pathogenicity by the reversible expression of surface antigens on bacterial membranes .

the rapid disappearance of the green pigmentation from cold-selected green a. pisum variants at 22°c suggests that temperature-dependent mechanisms control adenine methylation/demethylation within the endosymbiont genes, such as those encoding transposase and helicase. adenine methylation of these genes may affect additional genes related to cold adaptation and the accumulation/disappearance of green pigment. helicase is a key enzyme in dna replication  <cit>  and mismatch repair  <cit> , which is mediated by adenine methylation in the bacterial genome  <cit> . interestingly, cold adaptation of bacillus subtilis has been reported to be mediated by rna-helicase  <cit> , although the role of adenine methylation in the dna-helicase gene remains unknown.

a similar temperature-dependent phenomenon involving transposase activity in plants has been reported to be mediated by adenine methylation  <cit> . moreover, transposases of the thap  superfamily have been shown to be involved in cell-cycle regulation , epithelial cell regulation  and the regulation of gene expression and plant development  <cit> . transposases from this superfamily are also essential for the development of oxytricha, a genus of ciliate protozoa, in which they appear to rearrange hundreds of thousands of dna pieces to form functional rearranged genes. the organism inactivates the transposases when they are no longer required, resulting in a stable genome architecture  <cit> . furthermore, a drastic effect of adenine methylation on transposase activity has been reported in escherichia coli  <cit> .

as in other organisms, transposase genes in the endosymbiont bacteria of aphids might also be involved in genome rearrangement. this mechanism might help minimize the time required for the host to adapt to new environmental conditions  <cit> . the transcription start time  <cit>  and location of the transposase within the genome of the aphid endosymbiont bacteria might be controlled by adenine methylation within and upstream of the gene, as has been shown for other genes whose promoters exhibit dam methylation  <cit> . selective activation of the transposase within the bacteria may, in turn, affect the expression of essential genes and thereby contribute to the adaptation of the endosymbiont and its host to new environments, as described in this study for cold adaptation. more experiments should be performed in aphids to further evaluate the role of adenine methylation in transposases and other genes of secondary endosymbionts; this might be attained by high-throughput methods.

we can hypothesize that at least two methylation mechanisms coexist in aphids and provide epigenetic-based adaptive capabilities. the primary mechanism functions at the aphid genome level and involves the methylation of cytosine  <cit> . the secondary mechanism—the cooperative complementary mechanism described in this study—is based on the regulation of adenine methylation within “dynamic” endosymbiont genomes and enables the development of host aphid phenotypes that are adapted to a given environment. this paper suggests a theory in which the involvement of bacterial adenine methylation, as an ‘epigenetic regulator’, helps aphids adapt to extreme environmental conditions and host phenotypic diversity.

our experimental data demonstrate that the selection of rare profiles in a repertoire of strains is correlated with adenine methylation of pre-selected key proteins, which have the potential to rearrange the endosymbiont genome and lead to the development of a viable and robust aphid phenotype in an unfavorable environment.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that secondary endosymbionts contribute to aphid adaptation via the dam mechanism. regulation of adenine methylation within ‘dynamic’ endosymbiont genomes  is an additional mechanism assisting in aphid adaptation to a given environment which, in some cases, can be accompanied by a visible morphological phenotype. transposase-mediated transposition may play a role in the multiple genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that together contribute to aphid phenotypic criteria and might act in concert to maximize host adaptation to unfavorable environmental conditions.
