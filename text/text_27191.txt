BACKGROUND
streptococcus mutans is the primary etiological agent of human dental caries. it can metabolize a wide variety of carbohydrates that exist in the human oral cavity and produce large amounts of organic acids via the glycolytic pathway  <cit> . these metabolic byproducts cause a substantial drop in the ph of the oral cavity that in turn can result in the demineralization of enamel. the mechanisms of transport and metabolism of carbohydrates by s. mutans are therefore crucial to the onset and development of dental caries.

although there are examples of carbohydrates that are internalized through atp-binding cassette transporters   <cit> , or other pathways , the dominant, high-affinity, high-capacity mechanism to transport and concomitantly phosphorylate carbohydrates in s. mutans is the phosphoenolpyruvate -dependent sugar phosphotransferase system   <cit> . more than  <dig> unique pts permeases that transport a spectrum of carbohydrates including glucose  <cit> , sucrose  <cit> , mannose  <cit> , sorbitol  <cit> , fructose  <cit> , lactose  <cit> , galactose  <cit> , maltose  <cit>  and nigerose  <cit>  are present in the reference strain s. mutans ua <dig>  the pts is usually composed of two general energy-coupling proteins that participate in the phosphorylation of all pts substrates—the enzyme i  and histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein  and a series of substrate-specific permeases, known as enzyme ii  complexes, which are directly responsible for the transportation and phosphorylation of the substrates  <cit> . in most cases, the eii complexes are comprised of three functional domains, a, b, and c, but sometimes a fourth domain, d, is required. the eiia and eiib domains are located in the cytoplasm and take part in the phosphorylation of the cognate substrates, while the eiic and eiid domains act as the transmembrane channel and the sugar-binding site  <cit> . the pts phosphorylates carbohydrates at the expense of pep. during the transport process, the phosphoryl group on pep is transferred to ei, then to a histidine residue on hpr, then to eiia and eiib, and finally to eiic, forming a sugar-phosphate  <cit> . to date, a number of sugar-specific pts of s. mutans have been further studied, such as glucose, sucrose, fructose, mannose, sorbitol, etc. howerer, the study of l-ascorbate-specific pts of s. mutans is little.

previous studies have reported that some enteric bacteria can ferment and oxidize l-ascorbate under anaerobic conditions . the metabolism of l-ascorbate has been described in detail in escherichia coli , lactobacillus  <cit>  and pneumobacillus  <cit> , but no study has formally shown that s. mutans can ferment this compound. in natural environment, the energy supply for growth and survival is often a limiting factor, organisms regularly encounter such energy-limited conditions, and they are forced to scavenge energy from all potential sources. l-ascorbate is abundant in many fruits and vegetables, so to study on the l-ascorbate-specific pts that oral streptococci can use to obtain carbon sources is important.

currently, six genes, ptxa, ptxb, sgat, smu. <dig>  smu. <dig> and smu. <dig>  analogous to the ula regulon used by e. coli to catabolize l-ascorbate under anaerobic conditions, have been identified in the s. mutans genome. these genes encode putative eiia, eiib, and eiic of the l-ascorbate-specific pts of s. mutans and three catabolic enzymes in the pentose phosphate pathway. recently, the crystal structures of the ptxa  and ptxb  proteins have been analyzed  <cit> . specific hydrophobic structures between these two proteins allow for efficient transfer of the phosphoryl group from ptxa to ptxb and then to the substrate.

in the present study, we knocked out the putative l-ascorbate-specific eiia gene  and eiib gene , individually and together, in s. mutans ua <dig>  to explore their function. the results indicate that ptxa and ptxb are involved in growth, aciduricity, acidogenesis, and formation of biofilms and extracellular polysaccharides  when s. mutans is grown with l-ascorbate as the sole carbon source. moreover, the expression of ptxa is regulated by ptxb. ptxa, ptxb, and the adjacent genes sgat, smu. <dig>  smu. <dig> and smu. <dig> are parts of the same operon, and l-ascorbate is a potential inducer of the operon.

construction of ptxa−, ptxb−, and ptxa−, ptxb− double deletion mutants and complemented strains
the procedure for generating the plasmid for construction of a ptxa− strain was described previously  <cit> . briefly, the 5’ and 3’ regions flanking the ptxa gene were amplified from the genomic dna of s. mutans ua <dig> by polymerase chain reaction  using the primers shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  following proper restriction enzyme digestions, the flanking regions were cloned into two multiple cloning sites of plasmid pfw <dig> to generate pfw5a. subsequently, plasmid pfw5a was used to transform the wild-type strain ua <dig>  which resulted in replacement of the ptxa gene by a non-polar spectinomycin resistance  marker via allelic exchange. the transformation was carried out in bhi medium in the presence of 10 % heat-inactivated horse serum and  <dig> nm competence-stimulating peptide   <cit> . spectinomycin-resistant transformants were isolated, further confirmed by pcr and sequencing, and named s. mutans ptxa− strain. a similar technique was used to construct a ptxb− deletion mutant and a ptxa−, ptxb− double deletion mutant, named s. mutans ptxb− strain and s. mutans ptxab− strain, respectively. for complementation of mutants, the ptxa, ptxb, and ptxa–ptxb coding sequences, plus the pgtfb promoter  <cit> , were amplified by pcr, digested and cloned directly into shuttle vector pdl <dig> to generate pdl278:ptxa, pdl278:ptxb, pdl278:ptxab, respectively. after sequence confirmation, the correct plasmids were used for transformation of s. mutans ptxa−, ptxb−, and ptxab− strains, generating complemented strains s. mutans cptxa−, cptxb− and cptxab−, respectively.

bacterial growth rates
to measure the growth rates of s. mutans when using l-ascorbate or glucose as the sole carbon source, wild-type strain ua <dig> was grown in bhi medium overnight, and the optical density at 600 nm  of the cultures was adjusted to  <dig> . the adjusted cultures were inoculated 1: <dig> into fresh tvl or tvg medium. data for plotting growth curves were collected by measuring changes in od <dig> at 2 h intervals using a spectrophotometer over a total period of 48 h. to compare the growth rates among ua <dig> and its derivatives, overnight cultures were diluted 1: <dig> into fresh tvl medium, and od <dig> values were measured at 2 h intervals for a total of 72 h.

acid production assay
overnight cultures of wild-type s. mutans ua <dig> and its derivatives in bhi medium were diluted 1: <dig> with fresh tvl medium or fresh bhi medium and then incubated at 37 °c in an anaerobic atmosphere for 24 h and 48 h. the ph of the supernatant in the media was measured at the beginning, and after 24 h or 48 h of incubation. the acidogenesis ability was calculated as the difference in ph values measured at specific incubation times .

acid killing assay
the ability of the mutants to tolerate acid stress was determined by acid killing assays, as described previously  <cit> . briefly, s. mutans strains were grown in tvl medium until od600 ≈  <dig> , harvested by centrifugation at 3800 × g at 4 °c for 10 min, washed once with  <dig>  m glycine , ph  <dig> , then the cell pellets were resuspended in fresh tvl medium that was adjusted to ph  <dig>  with hcl to undergo an adaptive acid tolerance response. following an additional hour of incubation, cells were harvested, washed and subjected to acid killing by incubating the strains in  <dig>  m glycine, ph  <dig> , for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 45 min. the surviving cells were appropriately diluted, plated on bhi agar, and incubated in an anaerobic atmosphere at 37 °c for 48 h.

biofilm and eps formation analysis
to evaluate the biomass and structure of the biofilms with confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy, s. mutans ua <dig> and its derivatives were incubated in bhi medium overnight, and new cultures were inoculated by diluting them 1: <dig> into fresh tvl medium and dispensing 5 ml aliquots into 6-well plates  with coverslips in each well. after 120 h of 37 °c anaerobic incubation, the formed biofilms were washed gently twice with sterile pbs to remove unbound bacteria and stained with syto <dig>  for 15 min at room temperature in a dark room. after syto <dig> removal, biofilms were incubated in calcofluor white  to stain the eps under identical conditions. then the biofilms were washed gently twice with sterile pbs again and examined with an olympus fluoview fv10i confocal microscope . for the detection of syto <dig> , we used the 488 nm line of the argon laser. for calcofluor white , we used the 351 nm line. at least five independent fields were collected at 100× magnification per experiment and three independent experiments were performed. image j was used to calculate the area that the biofilms covered.

pcr analysis and quantitative real-time pcr
to characterize the mechanism regulating expression of the ptxa and ptxb genes, total rna was extracted and purified. briefly, an overnight culture of s. mutans ua <dig> was added to tvl medium or tvg medium and grown to late exponential phase. the cells were disrupted with liquid nitrogen and the rna was extracted with rnaiso reagent  and treated with dnase i . after confirming the absence of dna by pcr, the conversion of rna into cdna was carried out using the primescript rt master mix protocol . pcr was performed on cdna templates with specific primers that span the sequences smu. <dig> to sgat, sgat to ptxb, ptxb to ptxa, ptxa to smu. <dig>  smu. <dig> to smu. <dig>  smu. <dig> to smu. <dig> and smu. <dig> to smu. <dig> , using dna of s. mutans ua <dig> as a positive control  <cit> . to evaluate the expression of ptxa, ptxb and their adjacent genes under the influence of 15 mm l-ascorbate , quantitative real-time pcr  was performed with specific primers  using the sybr premix ex taq kit protocol . the qrt-pcr amplification with primers to the 16s rrna gene was used as a reference for normalization. non-template controls were included to confirm the absence of primer-dimer formation. in addition, expression of ptxa gene in wild-type ua <dig> and ptxb− strain was also evaluated by qrt-pcr.

statistical analysis
quantitative data were analyzed using the independent-samples t-test or one-way anova test, and a p value <  <dig>  indicated statistically significant differences.

RESULTS
deletion of ptxa or ptxb causes major defects in bacterial growth rates
in initial experiments, we tested the growth of the wild-type s. mutans ua <dig> under anaerobic conditions in tv base medium supplemented with various concentrations of l-ascorbate as the sole carbon source. we found that, to some extent, the growth yield increased with increase in the l-ascorbate concentration. however, higher concentrations retarded or even stopped growth. consequently, considering the terminal yield of bacteria and the extent of the lag phase, we selected 15 mm as the optimal concentration of l-ascorbate. when grown in the two different media, s. mutans reached a growth plateau in tvl medium at about 36 h, and in tvg medium at 14 h. the maximal culture density  in tvl medium was found to be reduced by more than one third of that in tvg medium . these results indicated that l-ascorbate could act as a carbon source for s. mutans to survive under anaerobic conditions, but not as effectively as glucose. the slow induction in tvl may in part account for its longer lag period and lower terminal yield.fig.  <dig> bacterial growth rates. a growth of s. mutans ua <dig> incubated in tv medium supplemented with 15 mm glucose  or l-ascorbate . b growth of wild-type ua <dig> , ptxa

deletions of the ptxa or ptxb genes impaired the ability of s. mutans to grow when using l-ascorbate as the sole carbohydrate . after 72 h of 37 °c anaerobic incubation, wild-type ua <dig> reached an od <dig> of  <dig>  and its lag phase was 12 h. however, compared with wild-type ua <dig>  the ptxa− strain had an extended lag phase and decreased growth yield. the lag phase of ptxa− strain was 22 h and its maximal culture density was only  <dig>  approximately. in addition, the growth of ptxb− and ptxab− strains was decreased even more substantially. in the 72 h of incubation, they could hardly grow. as expected, the presence of the recombinant plasmids pdl278:ptxa and pdl278:ptxab restored the anaerobic growth of the cptxa− and cptxab− strains on l-ascorbate, although the growth rates and the od <dig> were lower after 72 h of incubation when compared to those of the wild-type ua <dig>  however, the cptxb− strain could not be complemented by inclusion of the plasmid pdl278:ptxb.

ptxa and ptxb deletions resulted in reduced acidogenesis
as seen in the results of the acid production assay , the wild-type ua <dig> and all mutant derivatives grew well and acidified the medium to about the same terminal ph in bhi medium after both 24 h and 48 h of incubation. the Δph of the bhi medium was almost  <dig> . however, in the case of the tvl medium, the terminal ph slightly decreased for all strains after incubation. the three mutants, and especially the ptxb− and ptxab− strains, lowered the ph to a level significantly lower than that observed in wild-type ua <dig> culture after 24 h of incubation . the Δph of the tvl medium that ptxa− strain, ptxb− strain and ptxab− strain grown in were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. furthermore, complemented strains recovered their acid production capacity, with the exception of the cptxb− strain. the reduced growth of the cptxb− strain may account for its negligible ph change. results that after 48 h of incubation were the same, except that all strains had produced more acid and the Δph of the medium was greater than it was at 24 h.fig.  <dig> acid production assay. wild-type ua <dig>  ptxa

ptxa− and ptxb− mutants did not survive an acid shock
to determine the effects of ptxa and ptxb deletions on the ability to tolerate acid stress, the wild-type ua <dig> and single or double mutants were incubated in tvl medium with a ph of  <dig>  for 1 h to induce an adaptive acid tolerance response and then were subjected to acid killing with a low-ph buffer . however, none of the mutant strains formed colonies on the assay plates following 15 min of low-ph incubation in triplicate tests, showing that the acid shock caused serious damage to the mutants.

inactivation of the ptxa and ptxb genes affects biofilm and eps formation in tvl medium
it could be seen from the results of confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy analysis, biofilms stained with the fluorescent dye syto <dig> appeared green  and eps stained with calcofluor white appeared blue . the cover area of the biofilms formed by s. mutans ua <dig> and its derivatives was shown in table  <dig>  when using l-ascorbate as the sole carbon source, wild-type ua <dig> formed both small and large amorphous microcolonies and covered  <dig>  % of the surface. it created a thick and complex biofilms structure with a large amount of eps. however, the biofilms and eps ptxa− strain formed were sparser and much thinner than ua <dig>  it covered only  <dig>  % of the surface, but it still could form network structure. ptxb− and ptxab− strains formed much less prolific biofilms with only small amounts of eps, in which cells were scattered on the surface as chains and the biofilms were too thin to form three-dimensional structure.fig.  <dig> biofilm and eps formation analysis with confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy. wild-type ua <dig>  ptxa

they covered only  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the surface respectively. complementation in strains cptxa− and cptxab− restored biofilms and eps formation to a level similar to that of wild-type ua <dig>  however, cptxb− strain could not restore the wild-type phenotype.

transcriptional analysis of ptxa, ptxb and their operon
transcriptional analysis using cdna templates and primers that spanned the adjacent genes showed amplified bands in b, c, d, e and f regions  indicating that ptxa, ptxb, and the upstream gene sgat, the downstream genes smu. <dig>  smu. <dig> and smu. <dig> are parts of the same operon. however, smu. <dig> and smu. <dig> are not parts of it. quantitative real-time pcr  demonstrated that, compared with the gene expression in cells grown in medium containing glucose, the transcription level of these genes in cells grown in the presence of 15 mm l-ascorbate were all elevated significantly , further revealing that ptxa, ptxb, and the adjacent genes sgat, smu. <dig>  smu. <dig> and smu. <dig> are parts of the same operon. in addition, the higher transcription levels of ptxa and ptxb genes in tv medium containing only l-ascorbate reinforced the finding that s. mutans could ferment l-ascorbate to obtain energy under anaerobic conditions, and suggested that the presence of l-ascorbate was required for up-regulation of transcription of ptxa and ptxb. however, once ptxb gene was knockout, the expression of ptxa gene decreased significantly  compared with wild-type ua <dig> . this result could well explain the finding in bacterial growth rates that why the wild-type phenotype could not be restored in the cptxb− strain.fig.  <dig> transcription evaluation of ptxa, ptxb and their operon. a pcr analysis of ptxa, ptxb and adjacent genes with specific primers that span the sequences smu. <dig> to sgat, sgat to ptxb, ptxb to ptxa, ptxa to smu. <dig>  smu. <dig> to smu. <dig>  smu. <dig> to smu. <dig> and smu. <dig> to smu. <dig> by using cdna. the letters a-g correspond to the amplified regions illustrated above the agarose gel. lanes: m <dig>  100 bp dna ladder; dna, chromosomal dna of ua159; cdna, cdna of ua159; m <dig>  1 kb dna ladder. b quantitative real-time pcr  analysis of the influence of l-ascorbate on the transcription levels of ptxa, ptxb and adjacent genes. the results are presented as relative mrna expression. significant differences are indicated by **p <  <dig> . c expression of ptxa gene in wild-type ua <dig> and ptxb

discussion
since the first discovery of pts in e. coli  <cit> , special efforts have been made to study the characteristics and functions of various pts proteins in both gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms, including s. mutans, the most common pathogen in dental caries. the presence of pts involved in high-efficiency transport and phosphorylation of numerous carbohydrates largely accounts for the high cariogenicity of s. mutans. apart from the two general proteins, ei and hpr, many genes coding for different carbohydrate-specific eii complexes of the pts have been isolated and identified, such as the scra gene for sucrose  <cit> , the mtla gene for mannitol  <cit> , the lacfe genes for lactose  <cit> , the manlmn genes for mannose  <cit> , and others. in the present study, two genes, ptxa and ptxb, that were identified and presumed to be involved in anaerobic utilization of l-ascorbate, were analyzed.

similar to e. coli and some other enteric bacteria, s. mutans could grow in defined medium supplemented with l-ascorbate as the sole energy. this provided evidence that s. mutans can obtain energy by fermenting this compound in an anaerobic atmosphere. however, at high concentrations, l-ascorbate failed to support the growth of s. mutans. this may be the result of an alteration of the internal redox state of the cells  <cit> . l-ascorbate can trigger the fenton reaction in the presence of redox-active iron and oxygen, which yields ros from hydrogen peroxide and leads to oxidative stress  <cit> . moreover, although l-ascorbate is an effective antioxidant, h2o <dig> will be released from its oxidation and can cause damage to cells  <cit> . the deletion of the ptxa and ptxb genes seriously affected the growth of s. mutans when using l-ascorbate as the sole carbon source, which indicated that the ptxa and ptxb gene products are indeed involved in the anaerobic dissimilation of l-ascorbate. however, the deletion of ptxb caused a more severe impact on cell growth than deletion of ptxa, and the wild-type phenotype could not be restored in the cptxb− strain. this suggests that the ptxb gene, or its product, seems to be more important in this metabolic process. previous study has found that the interaction of ptxa and ptxb proteins of s. mutans is weak  <cit> , which increased the complexity of the phosphoryl transfer mechanism of l-ascorbate-specific pts of s. mutans. based on our experimental results, we have reasons to believe that ptxb plays a more essential role in the phosphoryl transfer. another reasonable interpretation is that deletion of the ptxb gene caused a polar effect on the downstream ptxa gene, in which case complementation by ptxb could not restore the phenotype.

s. mutans has the ability to produce organic acids and cause enamel demineralization, so acidogenic capacity plays a crucial role in the occurrence of caries. the acid production assay indicated that an absence of ptxa and ptxb genes leads to lower glycolytic activities. this weakened capacity for acidogenesis is likely attributed to the reduced ability to grow, as reflected by the reduced growth rates and culture densities. additionally, the ph of the medium can also affect the ability of glycolytic activity to lower the external ph. at lower ph, the cellular metabolism and energy levels are lower due to repression of amino acid synthesis genes. in addition, both glycolytic activity and amino acid biosynthesis require nad+ as a cofactor  <cit> . since the total intracellular nad+ pool is limited, competition between these two processes for nad+ should slow down both pathways  <cit> .

it is well known that s. mutans possesses an acid-tolerance response and the ability to tolerate acid stress will elevate after initial incubation in low ph medium  <cit> . however, according to the results from the acid killing assay, none of the three mutants could survive in a buffer with a ph of  <dig> , even after a 1 h acid adaptation. this showed that absence of the ptxa and ptxb genes resulted in the loss of the ability to tolerate acid stress when using l-ascorbate as the sole carbon source. the possible reason may be that l-ascorbate is not the most optimistic carbon source for s. mutans to ferment. the strains, on one hand, were under nutritional stress, and on the other hand, were under acidic stress. oral streptococci often encounter acid stress conditions in the oral cavity. therefore, the ability to survive acidic conditions may play a crucial role in the growth of these bacteria. proton extrusion by the membrane-associated f-atpase is the primary mechanism employed by s. mutans to maintain intracellular ph homeostasis  <cit> , and mutations in some genes can have an impact on the conformation of, and functional capacity to extrude protons by, the f-atpase enzyme  <cit> . however, the mechanism by which the absence of the ptxa and ptxb genes hinders the acid tolerance response remains to be discovered.

biofilm formation is an important pathogenic trait that allows bacteria to attach to and colonize the tooth surface. glucosyltransferases  and glucan-binding proteins  always play important roles in the process. however, when using l-ascorbate as the sole carbon source, ua <dig> still could form prolific biofilms and eps, with no sucrose or glucose exist. we speculated that the limited nutritional stress was responsible for the prolific biofilm and eps formation  <cit> . in tvl medium, l-ascorbate was the only energy source to support growth, and this may have automatically triggered biofilm formation because s. mutans is adapted to biofilm formation as its primary life style. what’s more, the difference of biofilm and eps formation capacity among wild-type strain, mutant strains and complemented strains is likely attributed to the difference of bacterial growth rates.

the carbohydrate-specific pts catalyze the concomitant transport and phosphorylation of their sugar substrates  <cit> . so far,  <dig> homologous l-ascorbate phosphotransferase transport systems from a wide variety of bacteria have been identified  <cit> . these systems fall into five structural types, and in s. mutans, eiia, eiib, and eiic are encoded by distinct genes. the ptxa and ptxb genes of s. mutans encode the putative eiia and eiib of the l-ascorbate-specific pts, and sgat encodes the putative eiic. what’s more, the downstream gene smu. <dig> encodes 3-keto-l-gulonate-6-phosphate decarboxylase, smu. <dig> encodes l-xylulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase, and smu. <dig> encodes l-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase. they also play essential roles in l-ascorbate metabolism. based on the pcr analysis using cdna as template, sgat, ptxb, ptxa, smu. <dig>  smu. <dig> and smu. <dig> appear be parts of the same operon. this is similar to the ulaa-f operon in e. coli  <cit>  that encodes the three components of the l-ascorbate phosphotransferase transport system , as well as three catabolic enzymes . the ulaa, ulab, and ulac gene products are involved in the uptake and phosphorylation of l-ascorbate, and the ulad, ulae, and ulaf gene products are involved in the subsequent metabolism by the pentose phosphate pathway  <cit> . based on the result that sgat, ptxa, ptxb, smu. <dig>  smu. <dig> and smu. <dig> could be all up-regulated significantly in the presence of l-ascorbate, it was concluded in this study that l-ascorbate is a potential inducer of the operon.

CONCLUSIONS
this work indicates that ptxa and ptxb genes, encode putative enzyme iia and enzyme iib of the l-ascorbate-specific pts in s. mutans, influence the physiology and virulence of s. mutans, including the growth rate, the capacity of aciduricity, acidogenesis, and formation of biofilm and eps when using l-ascorbate as the sole carbon source. in addition, the expression of ptxa is regulated by ptxb. ptxa, ptxb, and the adjacent genes sgat, smu. <dig>  smu. <dig> and smu. <dig> are parts of the same operon, and l-ascorbate is a potential inducer of the operon. functional analysis of genes in pts of the primary cariogenic etiological agent is crucial to the prevention and treatment of dental caries. current efforts are being directed toward gaining a better understanding of how these genes are regulated, and to reveal further insights into their roles in metabolic pathways.
