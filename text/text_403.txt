BACKGROUND
during gene expression, the coordinated action of several multiprotein complexes couple transcription, mrna biogenesis and export, to guarantee the proper maturation of transcripts before their translation in the cytoplasm  <cit> . mrna levels are highly regulated by transcription rate adjustments and mrna decay, to produce the appropriate number of transcripts competent for translation  <cit> . in yeast, two major cytoplasmic mrna degradation pathways control transcript turnover: the cytoplasmic exosome and the 5'→3' mrna decay. moreover, 5'→3' mrna decay and translation are interconnected processes providing an exquisite equilibrium between degradation, storage and translation that correlates with the type and localisation of the mrnp in the cell . work over the last few years has shown that different classes of mrnps are found as discrete granules in the cytoplasm. in yeast, different sorts of cytoplasmic mrnp granules have been described. among them, p-bodies  and stress granules  are the best characterised . p-bodies are implicated in translational repression, mrna storage and 5'→3' mrna decay  <cit> . the composition of pbs has been thoroughly studied. they are made up of a set of proteins that form the core of the particules, such as the decapping enzyme dcp1/dcp <dig>  activators of decapping dhh <dig>  pat <dig>  lsm1- <dig>  edc <dig> and the 5'→3' exonuclease xrn <dig>  <cit> . other proteins involved in different processes, such as nonsense-mediated decay   <cit>  and translation   <cit>  have also been reported to accumulate in these granules, but only under specific conditions.

a second class of well studied cytoplasmic mrnp structures are the stress granules . sgs are cytoplasmic mrnp accumulations that appear when translation initiation is impaired. study of stress granule formation has suggested that they contain mrnas stalled in the process of translation initiation. in yeast they characteristically contain poly mrna, the poly-binding protein pab <dig>  40s ribosomal subunits and the translation factors eif4e, eif4g, eif <dig> .

in yeast but also in other organisms, both types of granules are interconnected . strikingly, assembly of stress granules depends on p-body formation and several factors are present in both granules, suggesting a crosstalk between them  <cit> .

one key factor involved at different stages of nuclear mrna metabolism is the conserved sus <dig> protein, which is part of two stable nuclear complexes: the transcriptional coactivator saga and the nuclear pore associated trex <dig>  <cit> . biochemical and functional data have suggested a crucial nuclear role for sus <dig> in coupling transcription activation and mrna export. previously, we have shown that sus <dig> participates in histone h2b deubiquitination and histone h <dig> methylation together with the saga-dub subunits ubp <dig> and sgf <dig>  <cit> . sus <dig> mediates transcription activation through its associated with chromatin promoters as part of saga and is recruited to coding regions where it is necessary for transcription elongation  <cit> . interestingly, sus <dig> is also required for nuclear post-transcriptional events. after transcriptional shut off, sus <dig> affects both the morphology as well as the persistent tethering of the mrnps to their cognate gene, reinforcing the broad role of sus <dig> in nuclear mrna biogenesis  <cit> . furthermore, sus <dig> is crucial for trex2-npc interaction and its absence provokes a dramatic defect in mrna export  <cit> . altogether, sus <dig> participates in many nuclear events from early epigenetic modifications to mrna export through the nuclear pore .

strikingly, although sus1's described functions take place in the nucleus it was also observed in the cytoplasm of yeast and drosophila  <cit> , thus suggesting additional roles outside of the nucleus.

in this study, we describe genetic and functional links between sus <dig> and several components of p-bodies and stress granules. we demonstrate that sus <dig> deletion is synthetic lethal with 5'→3' decay machinery components lsm <dig> and pat <dig> and has a strong genetic interaction with lsm <dig> and dhh <dig>  interestingly, sus <dig> overexpression leads to an accumulation of sus <dig> at cytoplasmic granules, which can co-localise with p-bodies and stress granules. in addition, through affinity purification of tap tagged sus <dig>  we have identified novel physical interactions between sus <dig> and factors associated with p-body/stress granule. finally, absence of lsm <dig> and pat <dig> slightly promotes association between sus1-trex <dig>  taken together, our results reveal a novel link between the transcription/export factor sus <dig> and cytoplasmic mrna decay factors. thus, sus <dig> plays a broad role in mrna metabolism.

RESULTS
sus <dig> interacts genetically with components of the mrna degradation machinery
unveiling the network of genetic interactions for a given factor provides clues to understand its role in a cellular context. to further uncover sus1's molecular function, we utilized the biogrid database  <cit> , searching for the complete genetic network of sus1Δ. among others, we found a number of factors involved in mrna biogenesis, whose deletion enhanced the sus1Δ growth defect . moreover, recent analysis of wide yeast genetic interactions confirms these data and extends the list of sus1Δ interactors involved in mrna processing   <cit> .

to corroborate and extend this observation we generated double mutants of sus <dig> combined with deletions in pat <dig>  lsm <dig>  lsm <dig> or dhh <dig> and the resulting phenotypes were analysed. deletion of either pat <dig> or lsm <dig> in sus1Δ cells provokes a synthetic lethal phenotype . in addition, absence of lsm <dig> or dhh <dig> elicits an enhancement of the slow growth associated with sus1Δ . in conclusion, sus <dig> genetically interacts with key components of the cytoplasmic 5'→3' mrna decay machinery.

when overexpressed, sus <dig> accumulates at cytoplasmic granules
work from many laboratories has shown that some proteins involved in mrna metabolism are constituents of mrnp cytoplasmic granules . in light of the fact that there are genetic interactions between sus <dig> and some of these factors, we asked whether sus <dig> could accumulate at discrete cytoplasmic granules under specific conditions. interestingly, after glucose starvation or in stationary phase, we observed an accumulation of sus <dig> in discrete granules at the cytoplasm . moreover, overexpression of sus <dig> from its cdna  enhanced this accumulation. several types of cytoplasmic granules have been characterized in yeast including p-bodies and stress granules  <cit> . to address the nature of sus1-containing granules, we co-localised the p-body component dcp <dig> and sus <dig> in cells expressing sus <dig> cdna. as shown in figure 3a, sus <dig> partially co-localises with p-bodies under these conditions. from this, we conclude that sus <dig> can enter the p-bodies when overexpressed.

different factors contribute to the assembly of p-bodies under glucose deprivation. the general decapping activators dhh <dig>  pat <dig> and lsm <dig> have different roles in p-body assembly and composition  <cit> . since absence of lsm <dig> or pat <dig> is synthetic lethal with sus1Δ, we checked for the contribution of these factors to sus <dig> presence at cytoplasmic granules. cells lacking either lsm <dig> or pat <dig> were transformed with pgfp-sus1cdna and pdcp2-rfp; and localisation analysis of both proteins by fluorescence microscopy was performed. as shown in figure 3b, sus <dig> and dcp <dig> still co-localise in these mutant backgrounds. therefore, we conclude that sus <dig> co-localises with p-bodies independently of lsm <dig> and pat <dig>  to analyze whether sus <dig> might have a role in the assembly of cytoplasmic structures as p-bodies or stress granules, we localized dcp <dig> or pab <dig> in sus1Δ cells. as illustrated in figure 3c sus <dig> is dispensable for the formation of p-body and stress granule. thus, we conclude that sus <dig> appears not to be a structural component of p-bodies or stress granules.

sus <dig> interacts physically with components of p-bodies and stress granules
taken together our genetic and localisation results suggest that sus <dig> could transiently enter p-bodies. a tentative idea is that sus <dig> interacts with this mrnp early during transcription and a minor pool of the proteins could travel to the cytoplasm. to substantiate this idea, we studied whether sus <dig> physically interacts with proteins found in p-bodies. based on our genetic data we first tested the association between sus <dig> and dhh <dig>  cells expressing sus1-tap were grown in standard conditions and tap purification was performed as described previously  <cit>  and in methods. as shown in figure 4a, specific interaction between sus <dig> and dhh <dig> was demonstrated by western blot using anti-dhh <dig> antibodies. notably, we observed a reduction in sus <dig> expression in whole cell extracts  of cells lacking dhh <dig>  this decrease could impact on sus <dig> stability since the profile of the enriched sus1-tap calmoduline eluate in dhh1Δ is drastically affected . hence, we conclude that sus <dig> physically interacts with dhh <dig> and loss of dhh <dig> affects sus <dig> stability/expression.

to extend this observation, we performed sus1-tap purification and the enriched calmoduline eluate was this time analysed by multidimensional protein identification technology  in order to identify the polypeptide mixture present in our affinity purification. this kind of analysis has been extensively used to discover new interactors of a known protein and to study in more detail the proteomic characterization of different pathways  <cit> . our mudpit analysis  reveals that besides saga and trex <dig> subunits , sus <dig> co-purifies with the ribosome-associated factor stm <dig> and the translation initiation factors eif4e and eif4g. moreover, we also identified the poly binding proteins pab <dig>  pbp <dig>  pbp <dig>  lsm <dig> and mkt <dig>  furthermore, peptides corresponding to the 5'→3' exonuclease xrn <dig>  present at pbs and sgs and upf <dig> protein  were identified in our purification. altogether, our mudpit analysis reinforces our genetic and localisation data thereby revealing new physical connections between sus <dig> and factors involved in translation and mrna metabolism, some of which are localised to p-bodies and/or stress granules.

to strengthen our biochemical result showing physical interaction between sus <dig> and the sgs/pbs component pab <dig>  we checked for co-localisation between them in wild-type cells during stationary phase. as illustrated in figure 4c, sus <dig> and pab <dig> co-localise at discrete cytoplasmic granules. thus, we conclude that sus <dig> is present in pab1-containing granules, which support its presence at p-bodies and/or stress granules.

mrna decay components affect sus <dig> protein interactions
sus <dig> is part of two multiprotein assemblies, the saga and trex <dig> complexes . the levels of sus <dig> binding to each complex is important for their correct functionality. the fact that lsm <dig>  pat <dig> and dhh <dig> are genetically linked to sus <dig>  prompted us to test whether sus <dig> association with saga or trex <dig> components was disrupted in the absence of these proteins. hence, we genomically tap-tagged sus <dig> in lsm1Δ and pat1Δ strains and conducted sus1-tap purification using standard conditions. as illustrated in figure 5a, sus <dig> is associated with both saga and trex <dig> in lsm1Δ and pat1Δ strains. however, comparison between the calmoduline eluates from the three purifications by coomassie staining revealed a reproducible enrichment of sac <dig>  in lsm1Δ and pat1Δ compared to the wild-type. we conclude that the absence of lsm <dig> and pat <dig> improves sus1-sac <dig> association. both sac <dig> and sus <dig> bind to the essential mrna exporter mex <dig>  if loss of lsm <dig> and pat <dig> promotes the interaction between sus <dig> and trex <dig> it may increase the association between sus <dig> and mex <dig>  to test this possibility, we used western blot analysis to look for the presence of mex <dig> in the calmoduline eluates from our purifications. as shown in figure 5b a slight increase of the associated mrna export factor mex <dig> is observed, whereas no enrichment of the saga subunit taf <dig> was found. as loading controls, western blots of whole cell extracts  revealed similar expression for these proteins in wild-type and in both mutants strains . taken together, these results suggest that loss of lsm <dig> or pat <dig> alters the kinetics of sus <dig> associations.

discussion
sus <dig> is genetically linked to proteins involved in different stages of gene expression. previously, we reported that sus <dig> deletion is synthetic lethal with deletions in mrna export/biogenesis factors, namely mex <dig>  yra <dig>  dbp <dig>  nab <dig> and sub <dig>  <cit> . in this study we show strong genetic interactions between sus <dig> and pat <dig> or lsm <dig> , and dhh <dig> or lsm <dig> . lsm <dig>  lsm <dig>  pat <dig> and dhh <dig> are proteins involved in mrna degradation that are localised at cytoplasmic p-bodies  <cit> . thus these new genetic interactions between sus <dig> and these factors suggest a connection between sus <dig> and cytoplasmic mrna metabolism.

to gain knowledge about the functional meaning of these genetic interactions, we have investigated the presence of sus <dig> at p-bodies. in addition to the genetic link between sus <dig> and p-body components, we have been able to localise sus <dig> at cytoplasmic granules, by showing that it partially co-localises with dcp <dig> and pab <dig>  moreover, sus1-dcp <dig> co-localisation in the cytoplasmic granules is independent of lsm <dig> or pat <dig> and we have demonstrated that sus <dig> is dispensable for pb or sg assembly.

we showed previously that under standard growth conditions sus1-gfp is localized at the npc and the nuclear lumen, but that a weak signal could be detected in the cytoplasm  <cit> . however, sus <dig> was not visible at these granules suggesting that sus <dig> co-localisation with p-bodies might be very dynamic and transient. accordingly, we have shown that sus <dig> co-purifies with p-body components dhh <dig> and xrn <dig>  after standard sus1-tap purification. thus it is likely that a minor pool of the protein, undetectable by our fluorescence analysis, is in fact associated with cytoplasmic structures in physiological conditions. strikingly, during the revision process of this work, drosophila sus <dig>  has been observed in the cytoplasm  <cit> . kopytova and coworkers detected a significant amount of eny <dig> in the cytoplasm of drosophila s <dig> cells and they conclude that eny <dig> may also be of significance for the fate of mrnps in the cytoplasm.

sus <dig> also co-purifies with factors involved in translation initiation and poly binding proteins, which have also been reported to enter p-bodies and to be constituents of stress granules  <cit> . by mudpit analysis of our standard sus1-tap purification, peptides for eif4e, eif4g, pab <dig>  pbp <dig>  pbp <dig>  lsm <dig>  mkt <dig> and stm <dig> were found. in glucose starvation conditions, eif4e, eif4g and pab <dig> were shown to keep away from ribosomes and to localise at cytoplasmic granules originally named egp-bodies   <cit> . observations by hoyle and co-workers demonstrate that these mediators accumulate both in p-bodies and in egp-bodies. in these lines, co-localisation of sus <dig> and pab <dig> demonstrates that sus <dig> is present in pab1-containing granules during stationary phase, which supports our previous data and opens the possibility of sus <dig> presence also at sg and/or egp-bodies. in addition, sus <dig> also interacts with stm <dig>  which promotes dhh <dig> function in translation repression and mrna decay  <cit> .

what is sus <dig> function in the cytoplasmic mrna cycle? we speculate that sus <dig> can travel with the mrnps, especially since it is loaded early during transcription. it may then facilitate the interaction with other factors thereby providing a way to connect transcription and translation through mrnp metabolism. a possible scenario is that sus <dig> mediates different physical interactions between the p-body machinery and translation, to contribute to the fate of the mrna in the cytoplasm. in support of this model, the resolution of the sus <dig> structure in association with trex <dig> or saga has revealed that its structure is compatible with multiple associations  <cit> . the extended fold of sus <dig> creates a surprisingly large surface area for a protein of this size and this could facilitate the association of sus <dig> with other factors. previous work suggested that eif4e, eif4g and pab <dig> could be present on a subpopulation of mrnas in the p-bodies  <cit> . it was suggested that such mrna subpopulations could be a specific set of transcripts. based on these arguments it is possible that sus <dig> contributes to the mrna metabolism of saga dependent genes in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus. further experiments to characterize the composition of sus <dig> cytoplasmic structures will help us to verify this hypothesis. remarkably, a possible cytoplasmic role for sus <dig> is likely to be conserved through evolution since eny <dig> is present in the cytoplasm of drosophila s <dig> cells  <cit> , a finding which strongly supports our data. future work will help us to reveal new insights in to how sus <dig> participates in gene expression from chromatin modifications to mrna metabolism in the cytoplasm.

CONCLUSIONS
sus <dig> is genetically linked to factors involved in mrna decay. sus <dig> is observed at p-bodies and stress granules when overexpressed and it interacts physically with components of these cytoplasmic structures in normal conditions.
