BACKGROUND
cell-surface receptors play important roles in perceiving and processing signals at the cellular level. one large family of such cell-surface receptors are the receptor-like kinases   <cit> . there are over  <dig> rlks in arabidopsis and over  <dig> in rice  <cit> . the role of rlks as cell-surface receptors perceiving extracellular signals has been validated through functional characterization of several rlk members, e.g., receptor-like ser/thr kinases brassinosteroid-insensitive  <dig>  <cit>  and clavata <dig>  <cit> . rlks are typically comprised of an n-terminal extracellular domain, an intermediate transmembrane domain and a c-terminal kinase domain. a total of  <dig> subfamilies of rlks have been classified on the basis of their extracellular domains  <cit> .

the lectin receptor-like kinases  are defined by their characteristic extracellular lectin domain that resembles carbohydrate-binding lectin proteins in humans and animals  <cit> . however, no lecrlk has been found in the genomes of human or yeast and lecrlks are viewed as plant-specific  <cit> . lecrlks have been best characterized in the two model plant species, arabidopsis and rice. there are a total of  <dig> and  <dig> lecrlks in arabidopsis and rice, respectively  <cit> . available evidence suggested that lecrlk genes are also present in many other plant species including nicotiana benthamiana, solanum lycopersicum, arabidopsis lyrata, glycine max, medicago truncatula, zea mays and sorghum bicolor . although the number is low, lecrlk genes also exist in the non-vascular and non-seed baring plants, e.g., physcomitrella patens and selaginella moellendorffii, respectively  <cit> . lecrlks are further classified into three different forms, i.e., g-type, l-type and c-type, based on the lectin domain identity. there are 32 g-type, 42 l-type and  <dig> c-type lecrlks in arabidopsis, and 100 g-type, 72 l-type and  <dig> c-type lecrlks in rice  <cit> . the g-type lecrlks were known as b-type lecrlks due to the resemblance of their extracellular domain with the bulb-lectin proteins in humans and animals  <cit> . g-type lecrlks are also known as s-domain rlks due to the presence of an s-locus domain known to be involved in pollen self-incompatibility . the lectin domains of g-type lecrlks possess a β-barrel structure and are predicted to bind to α-d-mannose. many g-type lecrlks also contain a cysteine-rich epidermal growth factor  domain and a plasminogen/apple/nematode  domain  <cit> . the egf domain is predicted to be involved in the formation of disulfide bonds and the pan domain is believed to be involved in protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions  <cit> . it should be noted that egf and pan domains are only found in the g-type and are absent in the l-type and c-type lecrlks. the l-type lecrlks contain a characteristic legume-lectin domain that is believed to exhibit glucose/mannose-binding specificity  <cit> ; the c-type lecrlks contain a calcium-dependent carbohydrate-binding lectin domain.

substantial evidence suggests that lecrlks play important roles in plant development and innate immunity  <cit> . however, most studies on lecrlks were performed in the herbaceous plants. little is known about lecrlks in the perennial woody plants which are of significant importance to carbon sequestration, global carbon cycling, environmental and ecological systems and biomass production for forestry and bioenergy industries. populus is a model species for perennial woody plants but there are only a few early studies reporting on the presence of lecrlks . a comprehensive view of lecrlks in this perennial woody model plant is still lacking. here we report the genome-wide analysis of classification, domain architecture and expression of lecrlks in populus.

methods
lecrlk sequence homolog search in populus
populus lecrlk  amino acid sequences were collected from v <dig>  populus trichocarpa gene annotation curated in the phytozome  database managed by joint genome institute . to identify g-type ptlecrlks, at1g <dig>  was used as a query to collect its populus homologs by dual-affine smith-watermann alignments integrated in phytozome  <cit> . we only accepted ptlecrlks having over 30 % amino acid sequence similarity in the initial alignment. then, we performed the reciprocal alignment analysis using the populus lecrlk protein  showing highest amino acid sequence similarity with at1g <dig> as the input to search for additional potential populus homologs.

the same process was performed to identify l-type and c-type ptlecrlks using at2g <dig> and at1g <dig> as primary input query, respectively. the l-type ptlecrlk showing highest amino acid sequence similarity with at2g <dig>  potri006g <dig>  was then used as a template to search for additional potential populus homologs.

in case of isoform information among collected amino acid sequences, the longest full-length amino acid sequences were selected and used for further analyses. these full-length amino acid sequences were subjected to chromosome digram module integrated in popgenie  to generate ptlecrlk loci location on populus chromosomes  <cit> .

lecrlk sequence homolog search in moss, shrub, soybean and eucalyptus
to identify lecrlks in another woody plant, we searched eucalyptus grandis v <dig>  genome in phytozome v <dig>  by using the same approach that was taken to identify ptlecrlks. for the identification of g-type lecrlks in eucalyptus, we performed amino acid sequence alignment using at1g <dig>  as the initial query. we collected eucalyptus homologs with over 30 % similarity at the amino acid level with at1g <dig>  a second round of protein homolog search was performed by using potri.004g <dig>  as a new input to identify additional potential g-type eucalyptus lecrlks . finally, we used eucgr.d <dig>  the protein showing highest amino acid similarity with potri.004g <dig>  as a template to identify other potential homologs.

to search for l-type and c-type eglecrlks, at2g <dig> and at1g <dig> were used as the template, respectively. then, we used potri.006g <dig> that shows highest amino acid sequence similarity  with at2g <dig> as a template to identify additional potential homologs of l-type eglecrlks. potri.001g <dig>  the unique c-type ptlecrlk and the homolog of at1g <dig>  was used as a template to confirm the identification of c-type eglecrlk.

we also extended our search for lecrlks in moss , shrub , corn  and soybean . we used the same protocol and the same representative populus proteins. due to the evolutional distance of moss genome, we used 40 % similarity as a threshold to collect the full-length amino acid sequences of moss lecrlks. for c-type lecrlk analysis, single gene was identified from grape  genome by the same protocol.

functional domain annotation and functional motif prediction of ptlecrlks
to predict protein functional motifs and domains, including specific lectin and protein kinase domains, the full-length amino acid sequences of ptlecrlks were subjected to pfam v <dig>    <cit> , scanprosite v <dig>   <cit>  and interpro v <dig>    <cit>  based on hmmer  <cit> . since some motifs such as legume lectin and egf motif were not predicted in scanprosite, we merged those annotation results to generate a protein domain structure containing all predicted protein functional domains. from them, we filtered out the protein sequences missing either lectin or kinase domain for further analysis.

to assess the location and number of transmembrane domain , the full-length amino acid sequences used for alignment and phylogenetic analysis were subjected to tmhmm web-based software    <cit> . this software also provided the information on membrane transpassing pattern. significant tm prediction was determined by selecting the probability score ≥  <dig> .

signal peptide on amino acid sequence was predicted by signalp v <dig>   <cit> , under a valuable signal sequence selection score ≥  <dig> . when the tm motif was predicted as potential signal peptide, the priority was given to signal peptide prediction.

amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
phylogenetic and amino acid sequence alignment analyses of collected full-length ptlecrlks were conducted on geneious r <dig> software platform . the amino acid sequence identity of ptlecrlks was calculated by clustalw integrated in genious r <dig>  clustalw alignment was run under the typical options composed of blosum  <dig> cost matrix with the penalty of gap open cost  <dig> and gap extend cost  <dig> . to build phylogenetic tree, the same set of ptlecrlk amino acid sequences were subjected to muscle  by  <dig> maximum number of iterations together with kmer6_ <dig> for distance measurement under neighbor-joining clustering method  <cit> . the best fitting model for each phylogenetic tree construction was performed with muscle alignment result by model selection  method integrated in mega <dig>   <cit> . we applied the best fitting model for phylogenetic tree by selecting the model having the lowest value of akaike information criterion , bayesian information criterion , and maximum likelihood  values. to construct the best phylogenetic tree, we performed phyml method with the best fitting model for each phylogenetic tree  <cit> . the information of the best fitting model was described in each figure legend of phylogenetic tree. nearest-neighbor-interchange  was used as a heuristic to improve the likelihood tree.

to validate the phylogenetic tree, we rebuilt another phylogenetic tree by using the neighbor-joining method integrated in genious software with jukes-cantor genetic distance model using bootstrap  <dig> replicates resampling to assess statistical strength of phylogenetic tree with the same muscle alignment  <cit> .

analysis of gene expression of ptlecrlks
to compare the expression of ptlecrlks in different tissues and developmental stages, we compiled the expressed values of ptlecrlk genes from rna-seq data in different tissues under standard or treatment conditions from the populus gene atlas study at phytozome . normalized fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads  values were compared to determine gene expression in different tissues. collected data was summarized by heatmap function in ggplot <dig> r package  <cit> . to verify the expression of ptlecrlks identified in the gene atlas study, rt-pcr was performed with gene-specific primers for six ptlecrlk genes and the ptubcc as an internal control. all primers used for rt-pcr analysis are listed in the additional file  <dig>  the same tissues of root tip and root without root tip, internode and node of stem, and young leaf tissue that were originally used for rna extraction at oak ridge national laboratory for rna-seq at jgi in the populus gene atlas study were used for rna extraction for rt-pcr analysis. total rna was extracted from adopted tissues with purelink plant rna reagent  followed by rna purification with spectrum plant rna purification kit following the manufacturer’s protocol . one μg of total rna was used to synthesize complementary dna  by reverse transcription with revertaid reverse transcriptase . ten ng of reversely transcribed cdna was used to perform pcr reaction with the gene-specific primers in the pcr reaction mixture of dreamtaq green pcr master mix . the pcr reaction was performed with the program consisting of a pre-denaturation at 95 °c for 2 min, 30 cycles of the reaction of 95 °c for 30 s, 57 °c for 30 s and 72 °c for 30 s. another step of 72 °c for 7 min was followed for the final extension. the pcr amplification results were run on 1 % agarose gel. the gel image was taken by using chemidoc xrs+ image analysis system .

RESULTS
populus lecrlks identification and classification
the full-length amino acid sequences of three representative arabidopsis lecrlks  were used initially as templates to search for their sequence homologs encoded by the genome of populus trichocarpa . to identify additional potential homologs, the populus proteins showing highest amino acid sequence similarity with the corresponding g-, l- and c-type arabidopsis lecrlks were then used as templates to search the populus genome again. the search identified a total of  <dig> unique loci encoding lecrlks in populus . we refined our search criteria to identify only lecrlks that contain both a lectin domain and a kinase domain. these proteins were then classified as g-type, l-type and c-type ptlecrlks on the basis of the identity of lectin domain. it should be noted that there were a number of proteins that contain a lectin domain but lacks a kinase domain . for example, proteins encoded by potri.010g <dig> and potri.010g <dig> contain only a bulb  lectin domain, and as such, did not meet our criteria of being lecrlks and were not considered in subsequent analyses.table  <dig> number of different types of lecrlks in arabidopsis, rice, populus, eucalyptus, shrub, corn, soybean and moss

in order to validate the classification of ptlecrlks into alternate types, we performed three independent analyses using full-length amino acid sequences; i.e., i) amino acid sequence alignment; ii) amino acid identity and iii) phylogenetic analysis. we first analyzed randomly selected proteins, three each from g- and l-type, plus the sole c-type ptlecrlk. as shown in the additional file  <dig>  the lectin domain regions were distinct from each other whereas the protein kinase domains were highly conserved. the phylogenetic analysis with full-length amino acid sequences revealed that members from each type formed separate clades, with the l-type ptlecrlks showing at least 47 % amino acid identity each other and the g-type showing at least 66 % amino acid identity between currently selected proteins . on the basis of these results, phylogenetic analysis was performed with full-length amino acid sequences of all  <dig> ptlecrlks. as shown in fig.  <dig>  three different types of ptlecrlks were clearly separated in three different clades.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of full-length amino acid sequences of  <dig> ptlecrlks using maximum likelihood tree. the phylogenetic tree was constructed by phyml with the jtt + g model. alrt shimodaira-hasegawa -like branch support value is displayed in each node. note that three different types of ptlecrlks are categorized clearly in three different clades 



in total,  <dig> ptlecrlks with 180 g-type, 50 l-type and  <dig> c-type were identified . the total number of lecrlks in populus  is about three times that in arabidopsis . comparison between the numbers of lecrlks in these two dicot species also revealed that the number of g-type lecrlks in populus is larger than l-type  whereas in arabidopsis  <cit> , there are more l-type than g-type lecrlks . interestingly, there are also more g-type than l-type lecrlks in rice , similar to that in populus. however, although the total number of lecrlks in populus is larger than that in rice, populus has fewer l-type lecrlks than rice .

to extend our analysis to other woody species, we performed genome-wide search for lecrlks in the eucalyptus genome by the same approach that we used for identifying ptlecrlks. in addition, we searched lecrlk distribution in four more species including moss, shrub, corn and soybean. in total, we identified  <dig> eglecrlks  . soybean has  <dig> lecrlks . similar to populus, eucalyptus and soybean also have more g-type lecrlks than l-type. in shrub and corn, a total of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, were identified. moss has only  <dig> lecrlks. all tested genomes have one or two c-type lecrlk . taken together, these results suggest that the g-type lecrlks have been disproportionately expanded in populus, compared to arabidopsis. on the other hand, populus contains only one c-type lecrlk, identical to that in arabidopsis, rice and eucalyptus.

tandem repeats and size difference of ptlecrlks
among  <dig> ptlecrlks, a total of  <dig> ptlecrlk loci were distributed across most populus chromosomes;  <dig> ptlecrlk genes were annotated on scaffolds with an indeterminate chromosomal location. of the  <dig> ptlecrlk genes, approximately 38 % of the g-type ptlecrlks were found as clusters of tandem repeats . in some chromosomal locations on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  there were more than  <dig> ptlecrlk genes clustered together  . this tandem repeat feature is similar to that reported in brassicaceae and related outgroups  <cit>  and is likely a major attributor for the g-type lecrlk family expansion.fig.  <dig> chromosomal distribution of ptlecrlk genes in the genome of populus trichocarpa.

maximum likelihood tree of g-type ptlecrlks showed that tandem repeat genes on chromosome  <dig> were clustered in the same clade . ptlecrlk tandem repeat genes in the super tandem repeat regions of chromosome  <dig> were clustered in several neighboring clades . twelve out of  <dig> tandem repeat genes on chromosome  <dig> also occurred in an alternate clade that was clearly separated from the clade with the rest of genes . unlike g-type ptlecrlks, the only tandem repeat region for l-type ptlecrlks was found in the chromosome  <dig> where a total of 8 l-type ptlecrlks were clustered together .fig.  <dig> classification of different groups of g- and l-type ptlecrlks based on the phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood method . the full-length amino acid sequences of ptlecrlks were aligned using muscle. the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed by phyml. alrt sh-like branch support value is displayed in each node. a phylogenetic tree of g-type ptlecrlks. maximum likelihood tree was calculated with le gascuel  + g model with 180 g-type ptlecrlks and  <dig> representative g-type atlecrlks. at3g <dig>  was rooted to build phylogenetic tree. three super tandem repeated regions shown in fig.  <dig> are highlighted . the loci in alternate clade among tandem repeat ptlecrlk genes on chromosome  <dig> are marked with blue asterisks. the loci in alternate clade in tandem repeat ptlecrlk genes on chromosome  <dig> are labeled with red asterisks. b phylogenetic tree of l-type ptlecrlks. maximum likelihood tree was calculated with lg + g model with 50 l-type ptlecrlks and  <dig> atlecrlks. the distantly related at1g <dig>  and at3g <dig>  were used as distal proteins to construct phylogenetic tree. a tandem repeated region is highlighted by light blue



by examining amino acid number in each ptlecrlk, we found that g-type ptlecrlks are generally larger than l-type and c-type, with the average of  <dig> amino acids versus  <dig> in l-type and  <dig> in c-type . this is largely due to the fact that in addition to the lectin domain, g-type ptlecrlks often contain the egf and pan domains as well as the s-locus glycoprotein domain. in addition, some g-type ptlecrlks contain a duf <dig> domain in the c-terminus, posterior to the kinase domain. the largest ptlecrlk  has  <dig> amino acids.

phylogenetic analysis of ptlecrlks
to perform the phylogenetic tree analysis, maximum likelihood tree was constructed from alignment result using full-length amino acid sequences of ptlecrlks. for g-type phylogenetic tree construction, an arabidopsis lectin  <dig>   was used as an unrelated protein. this protein was also used as an outgroup in the previous phylogenetic analysis of arabidopsis and rice g-type lecrlks  <cit> . in addition, 8 g-type arabidopsis lecrlks that were classified as the representative genes in each group in phylogenetic tree  <cit>  were subjected together with 180 g-type ptlecrlks to build a phylogenetic tree. the phylogenetic tree of g-type ptlecrlks was constructed and clustered into several groups. the grouping was done in a manner similar to what was done for arabidopsis and rice lecrlks  <cit> . these 180 g-type ptlecrlks were divided into  <dig> large cluster groups . based on distinct clade formation, the group viii was subdivided into  <dig> different subgroups . all those super tandem repeated ptlecrlks were categorized in group viii as highlighted by different color . group iii to vii clades did not contain any arabidopsis g-type lecrlks.

through the same process, 50 l-type ptlecrlks were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. two distant arabidopsis proteins, pepk <dig> and wak <dig>  and  <dig> arabidopsis l-type lecrlks that were reported as the representative l-type atlecrlks in each group were used to define each clade  <cit> . based on the full-length amino acid sequence alignment of l-type ptlecrlks with arabidopsis proteins, the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree showed nine major groups that are classified by different clade separation . group iv was divided into two subgroups. this is also supported by the phylogenetic analysis of additional l-type lecrlks from eucalyptus . each group clade, except group iii of singleton clade, contains at least one arabidopsis l-type lecrlk .fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of g-, l-, and c-type ptlecrlks with lecrlks from arabidopsis, rice and eucalyptus. the full-length amino acid sequences of g- and l-type lecrlks were collected from arabidopsis, rice, and eucalyptus genome to perform phylogeny analysis with those of populus. c-type ptlecrlk was tested with full length amino acid sequences of those of moss , shrub , corn , soybean  and grape  as well as those of arabidopsis, rice and eucalyptus. a maximum likelihood for constructing g-type lecrlks phylogenetic tree calculated by lg + g model. alrt branch support is displayed in each node. at3g <dig>  was used as a distal protein to build phylogenetic tree. b maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree with jtt + g + invariant sites  model of l-type lecrlks. the distantly related at1g <dig>  and at3g <dig>  were rooted to classify groups in this analysis. alrt branch support value is displayed in each node. the clades including only g-type eglecrlks are highlighted with light red. a clade including g-type rice lecrlk is highlighted with light blue. c maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of c-type lecrlks with jtt + g model using  <dig> bootstrap. bootstrap values are shown to each node. the bar indicates the number of amino acids substitution per site



the constructed phylogenetic trees of g- and l-type ptlecrlks were validated by a different phylogenetic method using neighbor joining with  <dig> bootstraps . most clade formations were similar between these two methods except minor differences in clustering. for example, group viii-f merged into group viii-h clade in neighbor joining phylogenetic tree . nonetheless, ptlecrlks were consistently formatted into the same clade by using these two different methods for phylogenetic tree construction .

to assess whether the ptlecrlks were evolutionally separated from lecrlks in a different woody plant species, we compiled lecrlks from eucalyptus grandis v <dig>  genome in phytozyme v <dig> . eucalyptus genome has a total of  <dig> eglecrlks . for g-type lecrlk amino acid sequence alignment and phylogeny analysis, 180 g-type ptlecrlk were analyzed together with 118 g-type eglecrlks,  <dig> representative arabidopsis lecrlks  <cit>  including a distant arabidopsis protein , and  <dig> rice representative g-type lecrlks that were used as the representative members in each group to classify rice g-type lecrlks  <cit> . although we included eucalyptus and rice lecrlks in the analysis, typical nodes or branches shown in this tree  is similar to the tree constructed using populus and arabidopsis lecrlks . the groups vii and viiif-h clades were only shared by g-type lecrlks from woody plants without lecrlks from herbaceous plants . this observation was consistent with the phylogenetic trees built by a different tree building method  using neighbor joining method with  <dig> bootstrap resampling . this phylogenetic tree showed that three genes of group ii were divided into different new clades. group vi was also divided into two different clades. except for these two minor differences, the clustering and grouping results were almost identical between these two methods for phylogenetic tree construction.

same analysis was performed for l-type lecrlks by using all  <dig> ptlecrlks together with all  <dig> eglecrlks,  <dig> atlecrlks identified as the representative genes of each group in the published study  <cit> , and  <dig> rice lecrlks identified as the representative genes of each group in rice l-type lecrlk analysis in the published study  <cit> . the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree showed that the singleton clade of group iii shared its clade with four g-type eglecrlks . group iv-b was also divided to two clades with eglecrlks . all nine representative rice l-type lecrlks were integrated into group viii. this clade was distinctly separated from l-type lecrlks from other species . the clade next to group viii was the largest cluster consisting of only eglecrlks . in total, three distinct clades were associated with eglecrlks only . again, this pattern was also observed in the tree constructed by using the neighbor joining with  <dig>  bootstrap resampling method .

in the case of c-type lecrlk, we identified single c-type lecrlk in populus, eucalyptus, arabidopsis and rice genomes by amino acid sequence alignment with arabidopsis c-type lecrlk. to examine whether c-type lecrlk is also present as a single copy in other species, we extended our search to moss , shrub , corn , soybean  and grape . single copy of c-type lecrlk was identified in the grape, corn and shrub genomes whereas moss and soybean had two c-type lecrlks. to examine the evolutional relationship of c-type lecrlk, we constructed phylogenetic tree with full-length amino acid sequences of c-type lecrlks. the clade containing moss c-type lecrlks was placed far away from other land plant species. c-type lecrlks of shrub is closer with that of monocot plant than dicot woody and herbaceous plants . the phylogenetic tree using neighbor-joining method also showed a similar pattern .

domain architecture of ptlecrlks
as noted above, g-type ptlecrlks often contain mannose binding bulb-lectin domain, s-locus glycoprotein domain, egf domain, pan domain and duf <dig> domain and thus having more diverse domain architectures. within g-type, there are  <dig> ptlecrlks that contain all these five domains; only 16 g-type ptlecrlks contain a single domain, the bulb-lectin domain . a total of  <dig> out of 180 g-type ptlecrlks contain the s-locus glycoprotein domain. some unique domain architectures were also observed within the g-type ptlecrlks. for example, one g-type ptlecrlk  contains two tandem bulb-lectin domains. another g-type ptlecrlk  contains two s-locus protein domains and two pan domains . the largest g-type ptlecrlk  appears to be a fusion protein of two ptlecrlks with two bulb-lectin domains and two kinase domains . a prokaryotic lipoprotein lipid attachment motif was identified in a g-type ptlecrlk, potri.011g <dig> , implying that this protein is potentially subjected to post-translational modification for membrane localization. a total of 83 g-type ptlecrlks contain the duf <dig> domain at their c-terminus, posterior to the protein kinase domain . this duf <dig> domain has also been reported in lecrlks from other plant species  <cit>  but its function is unknown.fig.  <dig> domain architecture of ptlecrlks. g-type ptlecrlks  generally consist of bulb lectin  domain and s-locus glycoprotein domain at the n-terminus and protein kinase domain at the c-terminus, separated by the transmembrane domain. some g-type ptlecrlks also contain egf, pan and duf <dig> domains. l-type ptlecrlks  contain the extracellular legume lectin domain. c-type ptlecrlk contains the calcium-binding lectin domain



four g-type ptlecrlks have the truncated lectin domain, lacking at least  <dig> amino acids, and  <dig> other g-type ptlecrlks have a truncated protein kinase domain . in addition, we identified three highly conserved motifs in the bulb lectin domain and two cysteine-rich motifs , localized in the c-terminal region of egf motif and the middle of pan domain .

compared with g-type, the domain architecture of l-type and c-type ptlecrlks are less complex . all l-type ptlecrlks contain a single legume lectin domain. however, six l-type ptlecrlks had a truncated legume lectin domain and  <dig> others lack middle portion of conserved protein kinase domain . in addition, we identified three highly conserved motifs in the legume lectin domain of l-type ptlecrlks .

domain orientation of ptlecrlks
rlks are typically comprised of an extracellular domain, a tm and an intracellular kinase domain. our analysis of the tm domain, however, has revealed several interesting features for ptlecrlks. we identified ptlecrlks with diverse domain orientation features and classified them into eight different classes based on computational approaches of krogh et al.  <cit> . these eight different classes were first grouped on the basis of the number of tm domains, and then further separated by the position of lectin domain and kinase domain . class i to iii ptlecrlks have one, class iv to class vi have two, and class vii and class viii have three tm domains. class i ptlecrlks have a typical extracellular lectin domain and an intracellular kinase domain  ; there are 24 g-type and 15 l-type ptlecrlks falling into the class i category . class ii g-type ptlecrlks have a reversed extracellular kinase domain and an intracellular lectin domain , opposite of class i; there are 100 g-type proteins in this category, representing the largest group of g-type ptlecrlks. class iii ptlecrlks have an extracellular lectin domain and an extracellular kinase domain . class iv ptlecrlks also have both extracellular lectin domain and extracellular kinase domain but these domains are separated by two inverted tm domains . class v ptlecrlks have an extracellular kinase domain and an intracellular lectin domain with two inverted tm domains . class vi ptlecrlks have an extracellular lectin domain and an intracellular kinase domain with two inverted tm domains , opposite of class v. class vii ptlecrlk has two extracellular lectin domains and two kinase domains with three tm domains , resembling the fusion of two class i ptlecrlks. class viii ptlecrlk has an intracellular lectin domain and an extracellular kinase domain with three tm domains . class vii and viii ptlecrlks  were only identified in g-type ptlecrlks. it should be noted that such unusual domain orientation has been reported in lecrlks in other plant species  <cit> , but appeared to be more abundant in populus.fig.  <dig> domain orientation of ptlecrlks. on the basis of prediction of number of transmembrane domain  and the orientation of the lectin domain and the protein kinase domain, ptlecrlks were categorized into  <dig> different classes. a categorization of single-pass transmembrane ptlecrlks . b categorization of double-pass transmembrane ptlecrlks . c categorization of triple-pass transmembrane ptlecrlks . examples of representative member of each class are shown below each class

little is known about the function of lecrlks in populus. as the first attempt to provide insights into their potential functions, we analyzed the expression of ptlecrlk genes across various tissues and organs by mining rna-seq data from the populus gene atlas study in phytozome v <dig>  . in this study, there are  <dig> different samples including samples collected under standard and treatment conditions. we complied the fpkm values of ptlecrlk genes in three different types detected in  <dig> different samples in the additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  we also generated heatmap image of  <dig> ptlecrlk genes collected from  <dig> different samples under standard conditions . these datasets contain four different tissue types of different growth stages including two root samples , three leaf samples , two stem samples , and five bud samples . a large number of ptlecrlk genes  showed low  or undetectable expression  in the interrogated tissues . a total of  <dig> ptlecrlk genes  showed expression across all tissues . a total of  <dig> ptlecrlk genes  showed root-specific expression  . the bud tissues had the largest number of tissue-specific ptlecrlk genes with 41 g-type and 4 l-type . three genes including potri.011g <dig>  potri.013g <dig> and potri.010g <dig> were expressed solely in the stem tissues. a g-type ptlecrlk gene was expressed specifically in the leaf tissues with fpkm value close to  <dig> . in the analysis of reproductive tissues/organs from female and male populus trees, we observed that 21 g-type and 9 l-type ptlecrlk genes were specifically expressed in female reproductive tissues/organs. nine g-type and 1 l-type ptlecrlk genes were expressed only in male reproductive tissues/organs . the sole c-type ptlecrlk gene was expressed across all tissues examined . the distribution of the number of ptlecrlk genes from each group expressed in different tissues and organs is summarized in the additional file  <dig>  in general, no any group of ptlecrlk genes was uniquely expressed in a given tissue or organ.fig.  <dig> expression patterns of ptlecrlk genes. rna-seq data were collected from the populus gene atlas study in phytozome v <dig>  . the fpkm value of four different tissue types including root , leaf , stem  and bud  were analyzed. the tissue specificity of gene expression was determined by the comparison of fpkm value ≥ <dig> in a given tissue versus fpkm <  <dig> in other tissues. four different zones were categorized . a the expression patterns of the g-type ptlecrlk genes. b the expression patterns of the l-type ptlecrlk genes. c the expression pattern of the c-type ptlecrlk gene. d rt-pcr analysis

to verify the gene atlas dataset and tissue-specific gene expression in the tested tissues, we performed rt-pcr analysis with gene-specific primers using cdna generated from two root samples, one leaf sample, and two stem samples that were used for the populus gene atlas study. two genes from l-type and three genes from g-type, which were detected with higher fpkm value in root tissue than other tissues, were tested together with the sole c-type ptlecrlk. consistent with the rna-seq data, c-type ptlecrlk was detected across roots, leaf and stems . potr.007g <dig>  an l-type ptlecrlk, was detected in root tissues only. the other l-type ptlecrlk, potri.001g <dig>  was detected in root tissues and also weakly in two stem tissues . no transcript of these two l-type ptlecrlk genes was detected in young leaf tissues, which is consistent with gene atlas dataset . for g-type ptlecrlks, three tested genes were only detected in the root tissues . taken together, the results from the rt-pcr analysis was largely consistent with the gene atlas data.

discussion
the membrane-bound lecrlks are believed to play important roles in the cellular responses to external stimuli including pathogen attack, environmental stress and developmental clues  <cit> . current literatures reporting the classification and function of lecrlks have been limited in herbaceous plant including arabidopsis, tobacco, rice and tomato  <cit> . in this study, we identified 180 g-type, 50 l-type and  <dig> c-type lecrlks in the perennial woody model plant populus trichocarpa. our studies revealed several important features of lecrlks in populus.

expansion of lecrlks in populus
comparison of the total number of different types of lecrlks among arabidopsis, rice, corn, shrub, soybean, eucalyptus and populus revealed that the number of g-type lecrlks differed drastically among these species , and that in populus, g-type lecrlks have expanded. this notion is supported by the analysis of lecrlks in another woody species, eucalyptus. we identified a total of 118 g-type eglecrlk out of  <dig> eglecrlks . moreover, it was previously reported that the l-type lecrlks were expanded than g-type lecrlks in arabidopsis  <cit> . however, in populus, the number of g-type lecrlks is over three times that of l-type lecrlks . because the majority  of g-type ptlecrlks contains the s-locus glycoprotein domain which is an essential domain for sporophytic self-incompatibility response-related proteins, the difference in the number of g-type lecrlks between arabidopsis  and populus  may be partially explained by the fact that arabidopsis is a self-fertile plant whereas populus is an obligate outcrossing plant. because lecrlks are predominantly hypothesized to participate in biotic stress tolerance  <cit> , the large number of lecrlks in populus may also suggest that perennial plants have evolved a large array of lecrlks in response to longer life cycles and larger probability of exposure to more diverse microbial populations.

based on phylogenetic analysis of full-length amino acid sequences of lecrlks from populus, arabidopsis, eucalyptus and rice, both g-type and l-type lecrlks have the divergent group only associated with two woody species, implicating that woody plant lecrlks may have evolved divergent functions than herbaceous plants . interestingly, a major part of eucalyptus l-type lecrlks formed a unique clade next to ptlecrlks .

a total of 56 g-type ptlecrlk genes were expressed in the reproductive tissues/organs of female and male populus plant . among them, 21 g-type ptlecrlk genes were specifically expressed in female reproductive tissues/organs whereas 9 g-type ptlecrlk genes were specifically expressed in the male. it should be noted that the s-locus domain localized typically on g-type lecrlks was initially reported as the pollen factor inducing the rejection of self-pollen in the self-incompatibility process  <cit> . since populus is a dioecious species, s-locus domain-containing lecrlks are likely to have evolved new functions beyond its identified function in self-incompatibility.

tandem repeats of ptlecrlks
a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> ptlecrlk loci were assigned with chromosomal location and were distributed on most populus chromosomes. similar to what has been reported in other plant genomes  <cit> , ptlecrlks were found in tandem repeats in many chromosomes. three super tandem repeat regions of g-type ptlecrlk genes were identified in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . these super tandem duplicate gene clusters generally have high phylogenetic proximity each other as shown in the phylogenetic analysis . interestingly, the super tandem repeat genes of g-type ptlecrlks in chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> were less strictly clustered, implying that these ptlecrlks may have evolved different functions. these tandem duplicated genes do not appear to be derived from the salicoid whole-genome duplication event  <cit> , such that, the super tandem repeat region identified in the chromosome  <dig>  was absent on the chromosome  <dig> .

domain architecture and organization of ptlecrlks
by analyzing the predictions of domain architecture and organization, we observed several interesting features of ptlecrlks. firstly, in addition to the bulb lectin domain, g-type ptlecrlks often contain other domains including s-locus glycoprotein domain, egf domain, pan domain and duf <dig> domain. a total of 31 g-type ptlecrlks contain all of these five domains. the duf <dig> domain was found in 83 g-type ptlecrlks at their c-terminus posterior to the protein kinase domain . lecrlks are typically composed of an extracellular lectin domain and an intracellular pk domain, and in our study, we were able to classify ptlecrlks into  <dig> classes on the basis of tm domain predictions and found that most ptlecrlks belongs to the single tm protein group , thereby functioning as potential membrane bound receptors. however, we also identified a number of ptlecrlks with two or three tm domains . surprisingly, unlike reports from herbaceous plants, there are more ptlecrlks predicted to have an intracellular lectin domain and an extracellular protein kinase domain than ptlecrlks with an extracellular lectin domain and an intracellular protein kinase domain . the functional significance of these observations remains undefined.

two cysteine-rich motifs were identified in the c-terminal region of egf motif and the middle of pan domain of g-type ptlecrlks . these motifs may serve as potential protein-protein interaction sites. a number of ptlecrlks did not contain the tm domain . therefore, the action of such proteins may not be restricted to signal detection at the cell surface and may function in a non-membrane bound context. finally, a number of proteins with bulb lectin domain and legume lectin domain, but without the kinase domain, were identified . interestingly, some of these proteins also contain the egf, pan or duf <dig> domain . the transcript of genes encoding these lectin domain-containing proteins were detected in the populus gene atlas , suggesting that they are functional. presumably, these lectin domain-containing proteins can still bind carbohydrate ligands but their downstream actions do not rely on phosphorylation activity.

functional implication of ptlecrlks
lecrlks are specifically present in the plant kingdom. to date, no homologs of lecrlks have been reported in the genomes of fungus and human. lecrlks are known to play roles in plant development, innate immunity  <cit>  and abiotic responses . for example, pi-d <dig>  a rice g-type, and nblecrk, a tomato l-type lecrlk, were shown to play a role in plant defense against a fungal pathogen and phytophthora, respectively  <cit> . three tandem repeat lecrlk genes in arabidopsis were shown to function redundantly to regulate abscisic acid response in seed germination  <cit> . two l-type lecrlks, lecrk-ix. <dig> and lecrk-ix. <dig>  regulate phytophthora resistance and cell death in arabidopsis  <cit> . a g-type lecrlk in arabidopsis was shown to sense lipopolysaccharide, a potent microbe-associated molecular patterns from gram-negative pseudomonas and xanthomonas  <cit> . recently, one l-type lecrlk in arabidopsis was shown to function as a receptor for perceiving extracellular atp  <cit> . a cluster of g-type lecrlks in rice was shown to function together to confer broad-spectrum and durable insect resistance  <cit> . in our study, drastic number of ptlecrlks was expressed in root tissues . root serves as a front barrier as well as an interface for various soil microbes including bacteria, fungus, protozoa and nematodes. these root-expressed ptlecrlks have the potential to function as receptors for perceiving signals from soil microbes. in addition, approximately 50 % of ptlecrlk genes were expressed at very low or undetectable level in leaf, stem and root under normal conditions , implying that the expression of these ptlecrlks may depend on biotic or abiotic stimuli not contained in the current tested tissues and organs or developmental stage tissues. because no functional characterization of any ptlecrlks has been reported to date, this represents a fruitful area for further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
we have reported the genome-wide identification of lecrlks in the perennial woody model plant populus. we uncovered that the lecrlk family has expanded in populus. through transcriptomics analysis, we identified a number of tissue-specific ptlecrlk genes. this study provides a foundation for functional characterization of this important family of receptor-like kinases.
