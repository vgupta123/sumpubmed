BACKGROUND
until recently linkage studies were the best approach to identify genes responsible for genetic diseases. however, linkage studies are most successful in monogenic disorders with highly penetrant variants, and were most often only possible in families. unfortunately, the majority of genetic diseases are complex and therefore their genetic architectures could not be studied with linkage studies. following completion of the human genome and the development of accurate snp arrays, the human hapmap project  <cit>  cataloged the majority of common variants in the human genome. this catalog of snps facilitated the creation of genome-wide association studies   <cit> . in a gwas, the co-occurence of a given snp and a phenotype are assessed. snps present  significantly more often in individuals with a particular phenotype or more extreme phenotype, are reported as disease markers . gwas can be used to study both quantitative and binary phenotypes, and were the first effective approach for studying the genetics of complex traits.

in  <dig>  haines et al.  <cit>  conducted the first gwas, examining statistical significance between single snps and age-related macular degeneration. in the decade since, the success of this technique has been used to identify genetic factors associated with dozens of traits . the gwas catalog co-curated by the national human genome research institute and the european bioinformatics institute contains reported associations for thousands of gwas  <cit> .

unfortunately, gwas have several limitations. first, most gwas markers are thought to be non-functional, so while the marker may provide insights into regions of the genome important to a particular phenotype, unless the marker is functional it typically does not provide information about the specific biological mechanisms driving disease. second, the majority of gwas markers have only a very modest effect on risk for disease. third, despite thousands of gwas performed using progressively bigger datasets, collectively gwas snps only explain a portion—often a small portion—of the total estimated genetic variance for a given trait  <cit> .

a number of explanations exist for the unexplained genetic variance. one possibility is that gene-gene  interactions are a feature of the genetic architecture of these traits. gwas assume an additive model  and therefore cannot be used to detect epistatic interactions. numerous approaches have been attempted to identify epistasis including multifactor dimensionality reduction, regression , and others  <cit> , each with different pros and cons. in this manuscript we present a novel multi-snp gwas approach for identifying epistatic interactions and demonstrate its utility in alzheimer’s disease .

ad is the most common cause-of-death with no effective treatments and has a rapidly increasing incidence worldwide  <cit> . additionally, ad is the ideal phenotype to use to demonstrate the utility of our approach for two reasons: 1) epistasis has a role in the genetic architecture of ad  <cit> , and 2) despite very large gwas  and the identification of several rare snps , a substantial portion of the genetic variance remains unexplained  <cit> .
we only included snps that are consistently replicated in ad gwas studies 



methods
dataset
this research used  <dig> whole genomes  from the alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging intiative . the genomes were processed by adni using the burrows-wheeler aligner   <cit>  and the best practices of the genome analysis toolkit   <cit> . genomes were obtained from the adni database . the adni was launched in  <dig> as a public-private partnership, led by principal investigator michael w. weiner, md. the primary goal of adni has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging , positron emission tomography , other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment  and early ad. for up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.

single-snp gwas analysis
single-snp gwas uses a modified form of linkage disequilibrium  to infer relationships between single snps and observed phenotypes. in order to understand this approach, it is necessary to understand ld and how it is usually applied in genetic analyses. ld is a measure of how often two genomic features are inherited together within a population of interest, compared to how often they “should” be inherited together . ld d, the co-occurrence of events  a <dig> and b <dig>  is calculated as: 
 d=p−p∗p 

in the simple case often seen in genetics, these events are different nucleotides  that exist at specific positions in the genome. we would like our ld to reflect the likelihood of observing both snps together . unfortunately, d does not provide this information. however, a second measure of ld, r <dig>  based on d, is a measure of how closely related the two events  are. a measure of r2= <dig>  means they provide the exact same information, or always co-occur. d is converted to the pearson correlation coefficient r by the following: 
 r=d/p∗p∗p∗p 

in gwas, ld is used to select which snps from the genome to analyze. for example, if two snps provide the exact same information , then only one of the snps is analyzed. this reduces the total number of tests  by eliminating redundant tests.

in our research, rather than using p-values from a regression to assess the relationship between a snp  and ad case/control status , we calculated r <dig> between each snp in the dataset and ad case/control status. in this approach, the two events we are measuring are the co-occurence of a snp and ad case/control status . we accomplished this by writing our own algorithm that computes ld between each snp and ad case/control status.

an outline of our single-snp gwas algorithm is given in algorithm  <dig>  note that there are multiple genotype values of ai because there are two haplotypes. the computation of pearson’s r is as described above given the computed probabilities. this approach on a set of individuals, s, and a set of snps, l, runs in o time and with o space.



multi-snp gwas analysis
to extend to multi-snp gwas, we calculate ld between two snps and a phenotype. comparing the co-occurence of two snps and a trait results in eight different calculations for d of the form: 
 di,j,k=p−p∗p 

unlike in the single-snp case, the magnitude of d may differ between each of the eight comparisons. because we are concerned with the possibility of a specific combination of alleles impacting the trait, we take the maximum among all eight values for d. next we calculate r <dig> using the specific combination of alleles as one event and any other combination  as the alternate outcome for that event: 
 di,j,k=p∗)∗p∗p 

this results in the following equation for r: 
 r=maxi,j,k 

to calculate the correlation of all snps with every other snp would have exceeded our computational resources. we therefore calculated correlations between all snps and a subset of the snps that were located in genes with strongest and most consistent associations with ad . even this matrix was too large to fit into memory, so we computed subsections of the matrix in parallel on different machines. we found  <dig> pairs of snps with an r <dig> correlation greater than  <dig> . these we plotted using r to look for genes that had a  high correlation with other snps, as the relationship between two genes could provide important insights into disease processes.



an outline of our multi-snp parallelized gwas algorithm is given in algorithm  <dig>  the required start and end allow the task to be partitioned and run in parallel. there are multiple genotype values of ai and bj because there are two haplotypes. our solution on on a set of individuals, s, and a set of snps, l, runs in o time and with o space for each of k parallel runs .

RESULTS
single-snp gwas analysis
we knew in advance that our dataset would be insufficient to achieve statistical significance and present our results as a demonstration of how it could be used in a larger dataset. although manhattan plots are usually calculated using p-values, we used the r <dig> values to compare different snps . for each chromosome we computed and plotted the r <dig> of each snp in all gene-coding regions . this analysis provided a comparison to traditional gwas analyses as well as a comparison to our subsequent multi-snp analysis .

in this demonstration of our approach, we report  <dig> different snps with r2≥  <dig>  ) in  <dig> genes . of these  <dig> genes, we found  <dig>  that have been previously implicated in ad.

multi-snp gwas analysis
we calculated correlations between all snps and genic snps located in genes previously associated with ad , without regard to minor allele frequency . we selected  <dig>  as a cutoff for the multi-snp gwas analysis . of  <dig> million randomly selected snps from the distribution, only  <dig> had r2≥  <dig>  . in practice, a bonferroni correction could be performed by choosing different r <dig> cutoffs based on the corrected alpha. we identified  <dig> pairs correlated with ad with an r2≥  <dig> . additional file  <dig> lists the ad snp together with the non-ad snp and the r <dig> correlation with the ad phenotype. the table is sorted by r <dig> value . for each pair of genes, only snp pair with the highest r <dig> value was included. the final column indicates how many total significant snp pairs were found for the given pair of genes. for example, the highest correlation had an r <dig> value of  <dig>  and was found between rs <dig>  and a snp on chromosome  <dig> at position  <dig> . there were  <dig> significant snp pairs between these two genes. this could suggest an epistatic relationship between these two genes that is correlated with the ad phenotype.

to visualize our results, we plotted the correlation of ad snps  against all genic snps  in fig.  <dig>  only snp pairs with significant r <dig> values are shown. plotting the significant pairs revealed two very clear bands, and an additional three bands of interest. a vertical band indicates that an ad gene has significant epistatic interaction with other non-ad genes. the two clearest bands correspond with snps in hla-drb5/hla-drb <dig> and fermt <dig>  the other three bands correspond with snps in inpp5d, sorl <dig>  and rin3/slc24a <dig>  all but two known ad genes  had correlated snp pairs.  <dig> different non-ad genes had  <dig> or more correlated snp pairings.
fig.  <dig> results of the multi-snp gwas analysis. snp pairs with r
 <dig> values > <dig>  were plotted. snp id is based on snp order, not snp position. for genes with several correlated snp pairs, gene names roughly indicate corresponding snp ids . on the x-axis, any ad gene that had correlated snp pairings is labeled, and on the y-axis any gene that had  <dig> or more correlated snp pairings is labeled. to avoid plotting all snp positions, snp ids were used. snp ids reflect the same ordering as the associated snp positions but are limited to include only analyzed, gene-coding snps



among the  <dig> snp pairs with strongest correlation, half of the pairings include a snp from hla-drb <dig>  two from inpp5d, two from fermt <dig>  and one from ptk2b. all but one of the snps from the top  <dig> pairs mentioned comes from a unique snp with no prior reported ad involvement. among the top  <dig>  elf <dig> had two snps with significant pairings. the first  was correlated with rs <dig> in fermt <dig>  the second  was correlated with rs <dig> in ptk2b.

discussion
although our sample size is too small to identify statistically significant correlations, this work demonstrates the utility of taking a linkage disequilibrium approach in our single- and multi-snp gwas. first, we identified apoe as an important ad gene in the single-snp gwas using our new approach. this is hardly novel as two different apoe snps, rs <dig> and rs <dig>  are the most established genetic protective/risk factors for ad  <cit> . however, it is significant because the apoe effect is strong enough that we would expect to detect the signal in even a small dataset. in contrast, all of the other known variations that affect risk for ad are either very rare , or have very small effect sizes  <cit> . consequently, because of our sample size it is not surprising that we did not detect any other results of the ad markers in the single-snp gwas.

next, we applied our multi-snp gwas to identify pairs of snps jointly correlated with ad. in principle, epistatic interactions can exist between two genes that individually are not correlated with disease. in this study we tested the pairing of each genic snp in known ad genes with every other snp in the dataset. in this analysis there were five strong bands corresponding with ad genes with a large number of identified snpxsnp pairings.

among the  <dig> strongest correlations, elf <dig> had two correlated snps . elf <dig>  is a transcription factor involved in immunity and cell cycle control . the function of fermt <dig> is unknown. however, hla-drb <dig> has a direct role in immunity  <cit> . from a biological standpoint, an interaction between hla-drb <dig> and elf <dig> makes sense, and the immune system has a known role in ad  <cit> .

gria <dig>  is another gene with snps of potential interest. a snp in gria <dig>  was the second strongest correlation in our analyses , and gria <dig> is among the non ad genes with the highest number of correlations. gria <dig> is a glutamate receptor. glutamate receptors are the primary neurotransmitter receptors in human brains and gria <dig> specifically has a role in learning and memory. furthermore, gria <dig> has been implicated in numerous disorders in the brain including bipolar disorder, mental retardation, and encephalopathy with epileptic seizures   <cit> . finally, mutations in gria <dig> have been associated with cognitive impairment  <cit> . although gria <dig> has not been associated with ad, glutamate receptors have been studied  for their effect on alzheimer’s disease based on the hypothesis that malfunction of glutamate receptors leads to ad-specific cell loss  <cit> . when considering the function of gria <dig>  especially in relationship with a known ad snp , gria <dig> is an attractive candidate gene for further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we developed a novel multi-snp gwas method and demonstrated its utility in an ad dataset. using this approach we identified potential epistatic interactions that affect risk for ad. gria <dig>  in particular, is especially intriguing and warrants followup studies in larger datasets. due to the difficulty identifying epistatic interactions, relatively few interactions are known. future work will focus on developing an appropriate dataset with experimentally validated epistatic interactions for testing new models, integrating known biology of genes in identified interactions to identify mechanisms of synergistic functionality, and modification of the approach to more appropriately ascbribe statistical significance  to identified interactions.
