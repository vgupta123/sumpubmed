BACKGROUND
while nucleotide diversity studies and the development and deployment of single nucleotide polymorphism  markers are straightforward in diploid and paleopolyploid species, such as maize or soybean  <cit> , they are complicated in recently evolved polyploid species by high levels of orthologous gene similarity. sequence similarity makes sequencing of single genes and allocation of sequences into respective genomes difficult. special strategies are therefore required for nucleotide diversity studies and the development of snp markers for young polyploid species, which include wheat and other economically important plants.

wheat forms an allopolyploid series at three ploidy levels: diploid , tetraploid , and hexaploid . wild tetraploid emmer wheat  evolved between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million years ago  <cit>  via hybridization of wild t. urartu  and an extinct or undiscovered species in the lineage of aegilops speltoides   <cit> . hexaploid wheat  evolved about  <dig>  years ago  <cit>  via hybridization of t. turgidum with diploid ae. tauschii   <cit> .

a possible strategy for nucleotide diversity studies and snp discovery in young polyploid species, such as wheat, is to find diverged regions in orthologous genes and use them for the design of polymerase chain reaction  primers that anneal to only a single dna target. these genome-specific primers  amplify dna from only a single genome and facilitate gene sequencing and snp discovery  <cit> . an alternative strategy is to shotgun-sequence cdnas and then allocate each sequence to a genome. both approaches have been used in polyploid wheat  <cit>  although those studies were of limited scope and genome coverage  <cit>  and none mapped the markers.

a domestication bottleneck at the tetraploid level and a polyploidy bottleneck during the transition from the tetraploid to hexaploid level are expected to have reduced the diversity of polyploid wheat compared to wild emmer. nucleotide diversity θπ  <cit>  was reported to be  <dig>  × 10- <dig> in  <dig> a- and b-genome wild emmer genes  <cit> . for comparison, θπ was estimated to be  <dig>  × 10- <dig> in teosinte genes   <cit>  and  <dig>  to  <dig>  × 10- <dig> in wild barley genes   <cit> . the diversity of emmer was reduced by the domestication bottleneck but, curiously, no further diversity loss took place in the a and b genomes during the polyploidy bottleneck accompanying the evolution of t. aestivum from domesticated tetraploid wheat  <cit> . levels of diversity in the t. aestivum d genome are unknown.

genetic evidence suggests that wild emmer was domesticated in the diyarbakir region in southeastern turkey  <cit> . the result was hulled domesticated emmer , which was then the primary source of free-threshing tetraploid wheat, such as durum . transcaucasia and northwestern caspian iran appear to be the primary sites of the evolution of t. aestivum  <cit> . gene flow from wild to domesticated tetraploid wheat and from tetraploid wheat and ae. tauschii to t. aestivum has been experimentally documented  <cit>  but its impact on the evolution of the t. aestivum a, b, and d genomes is not clear.

we report here the development of gsps for t. aestivum and their use in sequencing of t. aestivum genes with the goal of characterizing the nucleotide diversity of the wheat genomes and discovering snps. to make the gsp development possible, a set of primers anchored in conserved exons flanking one or several introns was developed and is also reported. we refer to these as conserved primers , as in  <cit> . primers of this type have also been known as conserved orthologous sets   <cit> . a map of genes bearing snps constructed in diploid ae. tauschii is presented and compared with wheat deletion-bin gene maps  <cit> . nucleotide diversity in individual chromosomes in a wild emmer population from the diyarbakir region in turkey and in t. aestivum was computed and the distribution of diversity among and within wild emmer and t. aestivum genomes was used to analyze the early stages of polyploid evolution.

RESULTS
gsp development and snp discovery
the process of gsp and snp development is summarized in figure  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  wheat ests was downloaded from the west database into the pipeline and cps anchored in exons and flanking one or two introns were developed. the southern hybridization profiles of the ests were examined in the west database http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/cgi-bin/westsql/map_locus.cgi and cps for those that showed a complex profile were eliminated. amplicons were obtained with cps for  <dig>  t. urartu genes,  <dig>  ae. speltoides genes, and  <dig>  ae. tauschii genes and were sequenced. a total of  <dig>  genes was cloned and sequenced from langdon durum wheat. a total of  <dig>  gsps was designed and tested for genome specificity by pcr amplification of t. aestivum nullisomic-tetrasomic  lines. gsps derived from  <dig>  est unigenes  were validated by pcr with n-t lines.

target dna was pcr amplified in  <dig> wheat lines  using gsps. a total of  <dig> , <dig> bp of the amplicons was sequenced  using gsp pairs as sequencing primers, and  <dig>  snps at  <dig>  loci were discovered.

* accessions designated with  were developed and supplies by a. mujeeb-kazi, at cimmyt, those designated with  were developed and supplied by e.r. kerber, agriculture canada, winnipeg, manitoba, and that designated with  was developed and supplied by e.r. search, usda-ars, columbia, missouri

snp database
an online snp database http://probes.pw.usda.gov:8080/snpworld/search was constructed. it contains sequences of gsps for the amplification and sequencing of  <dig> loci and other relevant information about the ests and snps , top ten blast hits of each est, alignments of nucleotide sequences generated with primers derived from each est, a reference sequence for a locus and its source, and graphical and numerical displays of each snp. reference sequences were used to specify the positions of snps. for the majority of the loci, the cv 'chinese spring'  sequence was used as a reference sequence because of the central position of chinese spring in the unrooted phylogenetic tree of  <dig> t. aestivum lines . if the sequence from chinese spring was unavailable, the next most complete sequence for the locus was used. snps can be viewed in the context of the entire reference sequence in the expanded view window for each est.

the database also contains data for portions of  <dig>  genes amplified and sequenced with cps in t. urartu, ae. speltoides, and ae. tauschii http://probes.pw.usda.gov:8080/snpworld/search. the accession used as a reference sequence for a locus is indicated for each species. data in the database include  <dig> polymorphic loci containing  <dig>  snps for t. urartu,  <dig> polymorphic loci containing  <dig>  snps for ae. speltoides, and  <dig> polymorphic loci containing  <dig>  snps for ae. tauschii. additional snps for ae. tauschii can be found in the database for the d genomes of the synthetic wheats.

diversity maps
a single ae. tauschii est linkage map  <cit>  was used as the backbone of the diversity maps. the ae. tauschii map backbone contained  <dig> loci . cosegregating genes were allocated into "recombination blocks" which were sequentially numbered . the order of orthologous genes in rice was used to order genes within a recombination block.

synteny of the ae. tauschii genetic map with the rice genome sequence  <cit>  was exploited in mapping additional loci for which the parents of the ae. tauschii mapping population were not polymorphic  and which met the conditions detailed in materials and methods . in a few cases, in which an ambiguity was encountered in the rice genome sequence, sorghum and brachypodium distachyon genome sequences were employed  <cit> . consider, for example locus bg <dig> located on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> d . this locus was mapped to bins 1as <dig>  1bs <dig>  and 1ds <dig>  <cit> http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/cgi-bin/westsql/map_locus.cgi. the locus with the highest sequence similarity in rice is on pseudomolecule os <dig> starting at nucleotide  <dig> , <dig>  os <dig> is homoeologous with 1ds and mapping of the locus in the 1as <dig>  1bs <dig>  and 1ds <dig> bins is consistent with the position of the locus in os <dig> . pcr using genomic dna of n1a-t1b and n1a-t <dig> d as templates with the bg <dig> a-genome gsps showed that the locus used for the diversity study was on chromosome 1a http://probes.pw.usda.gov:8080/snpworld/search. inserting locus bg <dig> into the map on the basis of synteny of 1as <dig>  1bs <dig>  and 1ds <dig> with os <dig> placed it between recombination block  <dig>  and recombination block  <dig> . locus bg <dig> and its diversity data were therefore placed between loci be <dig> and bf <dig>  no cm value was attached to the locus but its coordinates on os <dig> were given .

loci corresponding to  <dig> ests were inserted into the diversity maps on the basis of this process , bringing the total number of loci on the map to  <dig>  . diversity was estimated from at least one genome for  <dig> est loci on the map. from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp were sequenced and mapped on the diversity maps for each genome × taxon combination . the numbers of discovered snps ranged from  <dig> in the t. aestivum d genome to  <dig>  in the wild emmer b genome. the highest average number of haplotypes per gene and highest average haplotype diversity was in the d genome of synthetic wheats whereas the lowest number of haplotypes per gene and lowest haplotype diversity was in the d genome of t. aestivum . in wild emmer and t. aestivum, the average numbers of haplotypes per gene and haplotype diversity did not significantly differ between the a and b genomes . however, both variables were significantly higher in the genomes of wild emmer than in the corresponding genomes of t. aestivum .

superimposition of diversity maps on the deletion-bin maps
wheat est deletion-bin maps are an important resource for the use of ests in wheat comparative mapping, map-based cloning of wheat genes, comparative genomics, and other genetic and genomic applications. to facilitate cross-referencing of est diversity data developed here with est deletion-bin maps, the wheat diversity maps were superimposed on the deletion bin maps .

the ae. tauschii linkage map  <cit>  and wheat deletion-bin maps share large numbers of loci, which facilitated comparison of the two sets of maps. only loci mapped by linkage were used for these comparisons. totals of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ests on the wheat a-, b- and d-genome deletion-bin maps were compared, respectively. the bin location of a locus was considered incongruent between the genetic and deletion-bin maps if it disagreed with the order of recombination blocks ; the order of loci within recombination blocks was disregarded. the known translocation differences involving chromosome 4a and chromosome arms 5al and 7bs  <cit>  were not considered. because the genetic maps of ae. tauschii chromosomes are highly colinear with the rice pseudomolecules  most of the disagreements between the linkage maps and deletion-bin maps would have to be due to structural differences between wheat and ae. tauschii chromosomes or due to incompleteness or inconsistencies in the deletion-bin maps.

the ae. tauschii linkage map portion of the diversity maps  is expected to be more consistent with the d-genome deletion-bin map than the a- and b-genome deletion-bin maps because the ae. tauschii chromosomes are phylogenetically more closely related to those of the wheat d genome than to those of the wheat a and b genomes, and this was indeed observed. while the locations of only  <dig> % of the loci on the d-genome deletion-bin maps were incongruent with the linkage map,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the a- and b-genome loci were incongruent . the greatest discrepancies relative to gene order in ae. tauschii and rice were encountered in chromosome arms 1al, 5as, 7al, 1bl, 5bs, 4dl, and 7ds, and none were found in chromosome arms 2bs, 2ds, 2dl, 3ds, and 5dl .

* chromosome 4a is extensively rearranged, and the congruence of the 4a deletion-bin map could not be meaningfully compared with the ae. tauschii linkage map.

nucleotide diversity
from  <dig> to  <dig> genes with estimated diversity were mapped in a genome × species combination . however, some of the loci were excluded from diversity analyses because of small sample size or because of unreasonably high diversity indicating the possibility of orthologous or paralogous sequences being included in a diversity estimate. the numbers of loci used for analyses of diversity were therefore lower . of the analyzed loci,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were polymorphic in the a and b genomes of t. aestivum, respectively, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  were polymorphic in the a and b genomes of wild emmer, respectively . only  <dig>  loci of the  <dig> analyzed in the t. aestivum d genome were polymorphic . because the same gsps resulted in the discovery of  <dig>  snp-bearing loci in the d genome of synthetic wheats , the low number of polymorphic loci in the wheat d genome must be an attribute of wheat, not of ae. tauschii, its diploid source.

*sums followed by the same letter are not statistically different at the 5% probability level.

genome-wide θw, and θπ were similar between the t. aestivum a and b genomes . both estimates were higher than those in the t. aestivum d genome . the estimates were also similar between the a and b genomes in wild emmer, which showed higher diversity than the corresponding genomes in t. aestivum .

* means sharing the same letter are not significantly different at the  <dig>  probability levels.

tajima's d contrasts θw, and θπ to detect differences in the distribution of diversity relative to neutral expectations. the expectation for a neutral locus in a population is a tajima's d of zero. positive values of tajima's d indicate a paucity of rare alleles and a preponderance of intermediate frequency alleles while negative values indicate a preponderance of rare alleles and a paucity of intermediate frequency alleles. average tajima's d was near zero in the a and b genomes of t. aestivum and wild emmer but was negative in the t. aestivum d genome and positive in the ae. tauschii genome present in synthetic wheats . the positive value of tajima's d in the d genome of synthetic wheats is very likely due to strong subdivision of ae. tauschii into two major subpopulations. this subdivision has been acknowledged taxonomically by elevating individuals of the two subpopulations to subspecies, ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata and ae. tauschii ssp. tauschii  <cit> . estimates of diversity at the replacement to silent codon sites in the d genome were similar to those in ae. tauschii and differed in both genomes from those in the a and b genomes of t. aestivum and wild emmer .

diversity among individual chromosomes
in the a genome of wild emmer and t. aestivum, diversity was lower in chromosome 4a than in the remaining chromosomes . this was true for diversity in coding sequences and in replacement and silent codon positions . because chromosome 4a differs structurally from the ae. tauschii homoeologue, the distribution of diversity along the chromosome was not investigated and it is not included in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  which illustrate the distribution of nucleotide diversity and the number of haplotypes per gene among and along the a-genome chromosomes. the distribution of diversity on chromosome 4a relative to its rearrangements will be addressed separately. in wild emmer, chromosome 5a also had lower diversity than the genome-wide average. chromosome 5a of t. aestivum and chromosomes 2a and 7a of wild emmer had higher diversity than the genome-wide average. with the sole exception of t. aestivum chromosome 2a, diversity was low in genes in proximal chromosomal regions and high in genes in distal chromosomal regions . in t. aestivum chromosome 3a, most genes had only one or two haplotypes . average tajima's d was close to zero in most a-genome chromosomes in t. aestivum with the exception of chromosome 7a, which had a negative average value, and chromosome 6a, which had a positive average value . in wild emmer, chromosome 4a had a negative tajima's d and chromosomes 2a and 7a had positive values.

* means outside of the 99% bootstrap confidence interval of the genome mean

in the b genome of t. aestivum, chromosome 2b had higher diversity and chromosome 4b had lower diversity than the rest of the chromosomes . diversity was low across the entire chromosome 4b , which also had the lowest number of haplotypes per locus and lowest haplotype diversity . except for genes in the distal region of the short arm of 4b, in which three haplotypes were observed in several genes, the proximal region of the short arm and the entire long arm had only one or two haplotypes per gene . the sole exception to this trend in the entire long arm was locus bf <dig>  which had three haplotypes. however, the third haplotype caused by a singleton snp that was not observed in any of the remaining  <dig> accessions could be a sequencing error. no other b-genome chromosome showed a similar pattern either in t. aestivum or wild emmer . wild emmer chromosome 5b had reduced diversity, lower number of haplotypes per gene, and lower haplotype diversity compared to the genome mean . diversity was reduced only in the proximal regions of both arms , and three or more haplotypes were observed in many genes . as in the a genome, most chromosomes in both t. aestivum and wild emmer showed low diversity in the proximal regions . t. aestivum chromosome 4b and wild emmer chromosome 5b had highly negative average tajima's d. in wild emmer, chromosome 4b also had a negative tajima's d and a high ratio of silent to replacement sites .

* means outside of the 99% bootstrap confidence interval of the genome mean

the d genome was the most uneven of the three t. aestivum genomes in terms of average nucleotide diversity per chromosome . the coefficient of variation among the d-genome chromosomes was three times greater than in the d genome of synthetic wheats . nucleotide polymorphism θw and nucleotide diversity θπ, the number of haplotypes per gene h, and haplotype diversity h were high in chromosomes  <dig> d and  <dig> d compared to genome averages  and high values were distributed across the entire lengths of the chromosomes . diversity was low in chromosomes  <dig> d and  <dig> d and both chromosomes were diversity impoverished across their entire lengths. chromosome  <dig> d had low diversity across its length except for the distal region of the long arm in which diversity was high. a similar pattern was observed in chromosome  <dig> d, in which genes in both distal regions showed relatively high diversity and those in the proximal regions showed low diversity. in only a few genes were there more than two haplotypes . genes with more than two haplotypes were invariably in regions of elevated nucleotide diversity in the d genome. computation of ratios of silent and replacement sites was greatly affected by the low levels of diversity in the d genome and was of limited value . all d-genome chromosomes had negative values of tajima's d but all seven d-genome chromosomes in synthetic wheats had positive values of tajima's d , which, like the estimates of diversity, shows that negative tajima's d is an attribute of the t. aestivum d genome but not of its ancestor.

wall's b is a measure of intralocus linkage disequilibrium . the higher the value of wall's b the greater the proportion of neighboring sites in complete disequilibrium. in wild emmer and t. aestivum, the a and b genomes showed similar values of wall's b, which ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . no significant differences were observed among the chromosomes. triticum aestivum chromosome 7b and the low diversity t. aestivum chromosome 4b had the highest wall's b values,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, indicating that genes on those chromosomes have on average the highest levels of intralocus ld in the a and b genomes. the average wall's b value of combined t. aestivum a and b genomes  was significantly higher  than that of wild emmer , indicating a higher ld in t. aestivum than in wild emmer. in the d genome, average wall's b  was significantly higher than in the a and b genomes indicating stronger linkage disequilibrium in the d-genome genes than in the a- and b-genome genes.

*means followed by the same letter are not statistically different at the 5% probability level.

minor allele frequency in the populations of  <dig> wild emmer chromosomes and  <dig> t. aestivum chromosomes giving rise to the folded site frequency spectra were computed for each polymorphic a, b, and d genome locus . folded site frequency spectrum measures the number of times a snp is observed in a sample. in both species, most minor alleles were present once. while the spectra were unimodal in t. aestivum they were bimodal in wild emmer, with the sole exception of the b-genome silent site spectrum. the difference between the spectra of the two populations suggests different demographic histories; the t. aestivum spectra resemble those typical of an expanding population whereas wild emmer spectra resemble a spectrum generated by a past bottleneck  <cit> . the folded spectra for the t. aestivum d genome declined faster than the spectra for the t. aestivum a and b genomes, which is consistent with higher numbers of rare polymorphisms in the d genome than in the a and b genomes as indicated by negative tajima's d for the t. aestivum d-genome chromosomes.

discussion
snp discovery
a snp discovery strategy based on the development of gsps and their deployment in the search for snps in wheat is reported here. as a first step in snp discovery, a cp pipeline was built starting with  <dig>  ests  <cit> . for these ests and an additional  <dig> for which primers were generated manually, only a small portion, about  <dig> %, ultimately resulted in validated gsps. even though the wheat genomes show low snp levels, more than half of the a- and b-genome gsps yielded an snp, demonstrating that the development of gsps is more difficult in polyploid wheat than snp discovery.

the rationale for gsp development is that they make snp markers versatile; any snp detection method can theoretically be used if gsps are available for the site in polyploid wheat. however, some snp genotyping methods do not require prior pcr amplification of the snp-containing targets in polyploid wheat  <cit>  making gsps superfluous. the cost/benefit ratio of gsp development should therefore be considered in the future development of snps for wheat.

another aspect of the snp development strategy employed here that needs consideration is the use of a distantly related relative as a source of information about the exon-splicing boundaries in ests for the design of cps  <cit> . the reliance on wheat-rice comparisons preferentially selected for the conserved gene repertoire, which is concentrated in the proximal, low-recombination regions of wheat chromosomes  <cit> . there is also the potential that a focus on conserved loci could result in a downward bias in diversity estimates.

a focus on single-copy loci may also affect the distribution of loci with snps along the chromosomes. in wheat  <cit> , as in other plants  <cit> , single-copy genes are preferentially located in the proximal, low-recombination regions whereas distal, high-recombination regions are enriched for multigene families. focusing on ests from single-copy genes may cause preferential development of snp markers for genes located in the proximal, low-recombination regions of chromosomes.

for these multiple reasons, the snp markers developed here are more abundant in the proximal, low-recombination regions of wheat chromosomes than in distal, high-recombination regions. this is particularly true for the distal  <dig> cm of the short arms of chromosomes in homoeologous groups  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which are poorly populated with snp markers.

diversity maps
comparative mapping based on rflp markers showed that gene order along the t. aestivum homoeologous chromosomes is highly conserved and that any one chromosome of a trio of homoeologous chromosomes can be used to approximate gene order along the other two  <cit>  and, as a matter of fact, along homoeologous chromosomes of other species throughout the tribe triticeae  <cit> . gene order is also surprisingly conserved across the entire grass family. approximately  <dig>   <dig>  and 66% of the loci on the ae. tauschii genetic map are colinear with genes along the sorghum, b. distachyon, and rice pseudomolecules, respectively  <cit> .

the conservation of gene order among wheat homoeologous chromosome and across the grass family was exploited here to summarize diversity in the wheat genomes using a single map. a comparative map of ae. tauschii  <cit>  was selected for that purpose. the high degree of gene synteny across grasses was exploited to insert into that map additional genes that in wheat contain snps but could not be mapped in ae. tauschii for lack of polymorphism.

the utility of the ae. tauschii linkage map as a representation of the linear order of genes in the wheat genomes depends on the extent to which the assumption of colinearity of the ae. tauschii and wheat chromosomes is true. known translocations exist among chromosomes 4a, 5a, and 7b, and chromosome 4a also acquired pericentric and paracentric inversions  <cit> . for chromosomes 4a and the translocated regions of 5a and 7b, the diversity maps reported here are of limited relevance.

since virtually all of the ests employed in snp discovery here had been previously mapped on the wheat deletion-bin maps, this is the first time it is therefore possible to compare the wheat bin maps with a high density genetic map of a closely related genome. the ae. tauschii genetic map that formed the backbone of the diversity maps was highly colinear with rice, b. distachyon, and sorghum genomic sequences  <cit> . there was a remarkably good agreement between the deletion-bin maps and the ae. tauschii genetic map for most chromosome arms and discrepancies were found for less than 10% of the loci. some of these discrepancies were biological in nature. the greatest number of discrepancies was in the b-genome deletion-bin map and the smallest in the d-genome deletion-bin map. the numbers of paralogous loci in the b genome outnumber those in the a or d genomes  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . the b genome is also more prone to translocation  <cit>  and undoubtedly other structural changes. both paralogous gene duplications and changes in chromosome structure manifest themselves as breaks in synteny between the ae. tauschii genetic map and wheat deletion-bin maps. the poorest fit between the genetic map and the deletion-bin maps found here for the b genome is therefore consistent with greater divergence of the b genome relative to the a and d genomes.

although the wheat d-genome map was the most similar to the ae. tauschii map of the three wheat deletion-bin maps, it too showed discrepancies relative to the ae. tauschii map in several chromosome arms. the largest number of loci showing a perturbed location on the deletion-bin map was observed in chromosome arm 4dl. ordering of loci in the 4dl arm bins on the basis of the ae. tauschii genetic map resulted in interdigitation of loci mapped in the neighboring bins 4dl <dig> and 4dl <dig>  the ae. tauschii genetic map shows many rearrangements in that region compared to rice chromosome os <dig>  <cit> . it is therefore possible that chromosome  <dig> d may contain a paracentric inversion spanning the boundary of bins 4dl <dig> and 4dl <dig>  which could account for the difficulties encountered during an attempt to recombine wheat homoeologous chromosome arms 4dl and 4bl in the kna <dig> region  <cit> .

a total of 36% of the loci on the diversity maps was mapped on the basis of synteny with rice. even though mapping of these loci was based on several lines of corroborating information, it is nevertheless an inference and must be treated with caution. the prerequisite corroborating information was not available for the remaining  <dig>  of the a-, b-, and d-genome loci harboring snps, and these markers were neither included on the diversity maps nor used in computations of diversity estimates, although they were included in the database http://probes.pw.usda.gov:8080/snpworld/search. the most frequent reason for the inability to map a locus on the basis of synteny was the failure to identify an orthologous region in rice. synteny is more rapidly lost in the distal regions of wheat chromosomes due to greater rates of gene deletions and gene duplications in the distal regions than in the proximal regions  <cit> . this factor contributed to the poor snp marker coverage in the distal regions of some of the chromosomes. for the same reasons, however, ests harboring snps that could not be mapped on the basis of synteny are preferentially located in distal chromosome regions. the project snp database should therefore be interrogated if additional snps are needed, particularly those in the distal chromosome regions.

genetic application of the diversity maps
the diversity maps reported in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> provide a convenient summary of snps http://probes.pw.usda.gov:8080/snpworld/search in genes that were mapped on the ae. tauschii map. a θw value of zero indicates no snp was present and high values suggest several snps at a locus in the respective population of t. aestivum and wild emmer lines. negative tajima's d values indicate low frequency snps and positive tajima's d values indicate a predominance of intermediate frequency snps at a locus.

tetraploid wheats were parents of nine synthetic wheats that were screened with data subsequently reported in the snp database. they included durum lines , the tetraploid component of t. aestivum 'canthatch' , and an emmer line . snps present in these lines are tabulated in the database. because they were not used in the computation of diversity measures, θw may be  <dig>  for a gene in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> but snps may exist in the a and b genomes of synthetics wheats in the database. this fact should be kept in mind when a specific locus is interrogated for a snp on the diversity maps.

although synthetic wheats rl <dig>  rl <dig>  rl <dig>  and rl <dig> share tetraploid canthatch as the source of their a and b genomes, they are occasionally polymorphic in the database. the tetraploid canthatch was developed by recurrent backcrossing of the pentaploid hybrid t. durum 'steward' × t. aestivum 'canthatch' to t. aestivum canthatch selecting tetraploid offspring in each generation  <cit> . snps occasionally observed among the four synthetic wheats are presumably residual germplasm of t. durum steward present in the tetraploid canthatch, indicating that a complete extraction of hexaploid wheat a and b genomes was not reached in tetraploid canthatch and that the tetraploid is heterozygous at some loci.

sampling nucleotide diversity for snp development
nucleotide diversity measured as θπ was similar in the t. aestivum a and b genomes and averaged  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  which is close to an estimate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> reported earlier  <cit> . the agreement between these two independent studies suggests that the sample of the t. aestivum lines used here was representative of t. aestivum and was adequate for snp discovery in all three wheat genomes. however, nucleotide diversity averaged across genomes of wild emmer  was lower than the estimated θπ =  <dig>  × 10- <dig> for wild emmer as a whole  <cit>  indicating that the population in the diyarbakir region has low diversity relative to species-wide samples of wild emmer. this is consistent with earlier rflp results  <cit> , which indicated that the greatest diversity in wild emmer exists in northern israel, southern lebanon, and southwestern syria  <cit> . because t. aestivum originated in transcaucasia  <cit> , the failure to sample wild emmer in those regions may have had a limited effect on the discovery of snps relevant for hexaploid wheat. however, it must have had a great effect on the discovery of snps relevant for durum wheat, because durum wheat originated in the eastern mediterranean  <cit> . inclusion of only a few durum accessions in the sample screened for snps here was inadequate to characterize durum diversity, and an additional snp search is needed for cultivated tetraploid wheat.

wheat diversity architecture
in spite of the fact that the three t. aestivum genomes have coexisted within a single nucleus since the origin of t. aestivum, profound differences were found among them. the a and b genomes are more diverse and show more uniform distributions of diversity across the genome than does the d genome. because of the short time that has elapsed since the origin of t. aestivum,  <dig>  years or less  <cit> , it is unlikely that most snps observed in t. aestivum originated there. it is much more likely that snps were contributed by gene flow from the ancestral species, tetraploid wheat and diploid ae. tauschii, or potentially polyploid species of aegilops having a d genome, such as ae. cylindrica, that occasionally hybridize with wheat  <cit> .

this intuitive argument is supported by differences in the ratio of replacement to silent polymorphisms in the t. aestivum genomes. evolution in young polyploids is accompanied by relaxed purifying selection acting on genes, which is shown by an order of magnitude greater rate of fixation of deletions of single-copy genes in tetraploid wheat than in diploid ae. tauschii and t. urartu  <cit> . if snps observed in t. aestivum were contributed by gene flow, genes in the a and b genomes should show ratios of replacement to silent site variation shifted towards  <dig>   compared to those in the d genome, which was observed. additionally, if the haplotypes present in t. aestivum were largely contributed by gene flow, this could increase the effective population size ne of the a and b genomes relative to the d genome because haplotype recombination in the a and b genomes could have taken place during the evolution of wild emmer. hence ld in the a and b genomes of t. aestivum is expected to be stronger than in the a and b genomes of wild emmer and ld in the d genome of t. aestivum is expected to be stronger than in the t. aestivum a and b genomes, which is what was observed. we therefore conclude that most of the differences in diversity between the a and b genomes on the one hand and the d genome on the other hand can be attributed to differences in gene flow.

the difference in gene flow among the genomes has a material basis. it is well known that very little reproductive isolation exists between hexaploid and tetraploid wheat because these species readily hybridize and the resulting pentaploid hybrids are usually fertile  <cit> . in contrast, hybridization between hexaploid wheat and ae. tauschii is difficult and hybrids are sterile  <cit> . landraces of hexaploid and tetraploid wheat have often been grown together, which has facilitated hybridization. in contrast, sympatry between t. aestivum and ae. tauschii has been limited by the geographic distribution of ae. tauschii. greater gene flow from the t. aestivum ancestors into the a and b genomes than into the d genome is therefore expected.

this study substantiated a previous survey of modern wheat varieties with snps developed here  <cit>  and showed that limited gene flow into the t. aestivum d genome has enriched it for rare alleles. the preponderance of rare alleles in the d genome is indicated by the negative average tajima's d observed in all seven d-genome chromosomes. site frequency spectra in the t. aestivum genomes show a steeper decline in the d genome than in the a and b genomes, which is consistent with more limited gene flow into the t. aestivum d genome than into the a and b genomes. these observations agree with previous isozyme, rflp, and snp studies on the origin of hexaploid wheat, which suggested that wheat originated via a very limited number of hybridization events  <cit> . snp data generated here showed that 93% of the  <dig> polymorphic genes in the d genome include only two haplotypes.

diversity contributed by gene flow into wheat was further shaped by several factors. one was reduced effective recombination accompanying self-pollination, the prevalent mating system in wheat. self-pollination can reduce the effective population size to half that expected under cross-pollination  <cit>  and enhance the effects of genetic drift on diversity  <cit> . self-pollination, by greatly impacting effective recombination  <cit> , increases the sizes of chromosomal segments hitchhiking along with positively selected genes  <cit> . low effective recombination is likely one of the contributing factors of the greatly uneven distribution of diversity in the t. aestivum d genome compared to the a and b genomes; the average θπ per chromosome was found to be six-fold higher in the most-diverse d-genome chromosome compared to the least-diverse d-genome chromosome. diversity is high along the entirety of chromosomes  <dig> d and  <dig> d, the distal portion of the long arm of chromosome  <dig> d, and both distal regions of chromosome  <dig> d. in contrast, the entirety of chromosomes  <dig> d and  <dig> d, three-quarters of chromosome  <dig> d, and proximal regions of  <dig> d have very low levels of diversity. this suggests that under limited gene flow and self-pollination, genetic drift and selection may impact diversity along large chromosomal regions in wheat.

several a- and b-genome chromosomes show that effects shaping the diversity of entire chromosomes may occasionally take place even under the regime of moderate gene flow in polyploid genomes. diversity in t. aestivum chromosome 4b mimics in all respects diversity in the d genome. the entire chromosome is diversity impoverished and the chromosome has a highly negative tajima's d. as in the d-genome chromosomes, most of the 4b genes have either one or two haplotypes. chromosome 4b is polymorphic for a pericentric inversion in t. aestivum  <cit> , and homoeologous group  <dig> has a lower number of genes than the remaining six triticeae homoeologous groups  <cit> , presumably due to the translocation of the gene-rich terminal region of the short arm of chromosome  <dig> to the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . recombination takes place primarily in genes. low number of genes on chromosome 4b would probably result in low crossover frequencies in this chromosome, which was observed  <cit> . the net effects of limited effective recombination may be that a large portion of this chromosome has hitchhiked during episodes of positive selection during the evolution of t. aestivum or was subjected to a reduction in effective population size during episodes of background selection  <cit> . a long-range loss of diversity may have also taken place in wild emmer chromosome 5b, which also has a negative average tajima's d. another chromosome in which a chromosome-sized loss of diversity has taken place is 4a. in this chromosome, the loss of diversity was undoubtedly caused by the fixation of inversions suppressing recombination in a heterozygous state.

another factor that must have had a significant impact on the architecture of diversity in wheat is the expression of the ph <dig> locus, which is unique to polyploid wheat. its primary function is to preclude recombination between homoeologous chromosomes  <cit> . importantly, ph <dig> also negatively effects recombination between heterozygous homologues  <cit> . the activity of ph <dig> therefore has similar effects on diversity as self-pollination. for an unknown reason, ph <dig> negatively affects recombination in the b genome more than in the a genome  <cit> . the t. aestivum b genome shows greater variation in diversity among chromosomes than the a genome. the coefficients of variation were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for θw, and θπ among the t. aestivum a-genome chromosomes but were respectively  <dig>  and  <dig>  among the t. aestivum b-genome chromosomes, which is consistent with more reduced recombination in the b genome than in the a genome due to ph <dig> effects. recombination between the ae. tauschii chromosomes and wheat d-genome chromosomes is even more affected by ph <dig> than recombination between wheat heterozygous homologues  <cit> . in agreement, t. aestivum d-genome chromosomes show the greatest variation in diversity among the three genomes; coefficients of variation were respectively  <dig>  and  <dig>  for θw, and θπ among the d-genome chromosomes. we suggest that the synergy of self-pollination and suppression of recombination due to ph <dig> results in high levels of random drift, loss of diversity from large chromosome regions, and relatively high variance in diversity among chromosomes.

CONCLUSIONS
distinctly different diversity patterns were found in two closely related polyploid species of differing age, the recently evolved t. aestivum and the older wild emmer. in wild emmer, diversity is uniform among genomes and chromosomes but in t. aestivum, diversity is heterogeneous both among both genomes and chromosomes. these observations suggest the following scenario of polyploid evolution. in a nascent polyploid, diversity almost entirely depends on gene flow from the ancestral species. during that period, diversity is greatly affected by stochastic and directional processes, particularly under self-pollination that is wide spread in polyploids. dependence on gene flow and the synergy of self-pollination and action of ph1-like genes results in low and heterogeneous diversity across genomes. if gene flow cannot keep pace with the population expansion, diversity is dominated by rare alleles. large chromosomal regions or whole chromosomes are subjected to genetic drift and hitchhiking resulting in their low diversity. as time passes, the accumulation of new mutations results in an increased and more uniformly distributed diversity across the genome, as is seen in wild emmer.
