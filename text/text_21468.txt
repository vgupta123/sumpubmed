BACKGROUND
atherogenesis involves the cellular infiltration of several cell types, including monocytes, t lymphocytes, and mast cells. cytokine secretion by these cells and endothelial cells are contributing factors in the growth and propagation of atherosclerotic plaques as well as the stability and degradation of fibrous caps. cytokines implicated in atherogenesis include interleukin -1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tumor necrosis factor   <cit> .

il-1β is secreted mainly by macrophages and virtually by every cell type in the body. il-1β is produced in response to various stimulants, such as cytokines, bacteria, and viruses, but most interestingly to epinephrine  <cit> . il-1β has a broad range of functions which includes activation of neutrophils, endothelial cells, monocytes, t-cells, and mast cells. it may also induce procoagulant changes in endothelial tissue. il- <dig> induces an acute phase response consisting of increased fibrinogen synthesis and thrombocytosis with increased vascular permeability. the detection of il- <dig> in the blood of patients suffering from unstable angina suggests that nuclear factor-kappa b  activation may be occurring at the vascular level in patients with heart disease  <cit> . il- <dig> is in the cxc family of chemokines and functions to recruit neutrophils to the site of inflammation. il- <dig> exerts multiple effects on cell differentiation and function of monocytes/macrophages. it can also suppress the cytotoxic function of monocytes/macrophages and the production of proinflammatory cytokines by these cells  <cit> .

mast cells are found preferentially around blood vessels and beneath the epithelium of the skin and mucus membranes  <cit> . traditionally, mast cells are responsible for allergy and asthma pathogenesis. typically, mast cell activation occurs in response to cross-linkage of the high affinity ige receptor  by antigen and ige  <cit> . activation may also occur in response to a range of agents, such as pathogens, cytokines, and even oxidized low density lipoprotein . after activation, key mediators secreted by mast cells include preformed mediators like histamine, proteoglycans, proteases, and several cytokines and growth factors  <cit> . mast cells have been observed in both aortic atherosclerotic lesions and in coronary arteries. the large numbers of mast cells found in the adventitia of arteries and in the intima are in proportion to the severity of heart disease  <cit> . the study of the distribution, activation, and phenotype of mast cells in lesions of  <dig> specimens of human carotid arteries by jeziorski, et al. further supports the role of mast cells in atherogenesis  <cit> . they demonstrated significant numbers and focal accumulations of mast cells in association with macrophages and extensive activation/degranulation at all developmental stages of atherosclerotic lesion development. it now appears likely that inflammatory events and mast cells play an important role in atherogenesis as recently reviewed by us  <cit> .

stress is known to influence immune function  <cit> . an immunoregulatory effect of the sympathetic nervous system in stress has been indicated for some time  <cit> . catecholamines, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine, are elevated in stress responses, and mediate vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure as a result of increased peripheral vascular resistance. in disorders such as sepsis, cardiovascular disease, or cocaine abuse, catecholamines are elaborated in excess. sustained increases in circulating catecholamines by infusion of epinephrine or norepinephrine have been shown to cause moderate cardiovascular and metabolic effects  <cit> . catecholamines induce aggravation of aortic and coronary atherosclerosis in monkeys  <cit>  and play a direct role in atherogenesis and cardiovascular disease  <cit> .

epinephrine and norepinephrine increase the uptake of low density lipoprotein in atheroscelotic plaques in rabbits and rats  <cit>  as well as enhance proliferation of rat endothelial and smooth muscle cells  <cit> . it has been reported that norepinephrine increases adherence and chemotaxis of macrophages  <cit> . epinephrine also upregulates the surface expression of l-selectin on monocytes in vitro  <cit> . most recently, we have reported that nitric oxide production from macrophages induced by lps is enhanced by catecholamines  <cit> . both epinephrine and il- <dig> are involved in acute phase responses seen in stress and in coronary artery disease. studies have shown that norepinephrine can induce il-1β mrna in mycocardial tissue  <cit>  and that infusion of il-1β in animal models can induce expression of catecholamines  <cit> . these data suggest that, in some conditions, both il-1β and catecholamines can be delivered to tissues that can then mediate additive or modulatory effects. moreover, as reviewed by gidron y et al.,  <cit>  stress in conjunction with the release of catecholamines and proinflammatory cytokines, can potentiate atherogenesis. hence, studies of the interactions between catecholamines, monokines and inflammatory cell activation are especially relevant. the aim of the study was to determine whether epinephrine affects il-1β induced proatherogenic cytokine production in mast cells, a phenomenon previously not described. our results indicated that epinephrine synergized with il-1β in the production of proatherogenic cytokines, suggesting a potential role for this interaction in inflammatory and atherogenic states.

RESULTS
epinephrine enhances il-1β-induced il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> production in mast cells
human mast cell line, hmc- <dig>  was incubated with il-1β at various concentrations for  <dig> hours. the cell free supernatants of the cultures were harvested and subjected to il- <dig> assay. hmc- <dig> cultured in medium alone produced trace amounts of il- <dig>  the il- <dig> production from hmc- <dig> cultures treated with il-1β was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner  . since there was no significant difference in the il- <dig> production induced by il-1β at concentrations of  <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml,  <dig> ng/ml of il-1β has been used to induce cytokine production in hmc- <dig> for the rest of the experiments. epinephrine  alone at a concentration of 10- <dig> m did not induce production of il- <dig> in hmc- <dig> . when epinephrine at 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> m concentration was added simultaneously with il-1β into the cultures, the production of il- <dig> was enhanced significantly  compared with that induced by il-1β alone . since the physiological concentration of epinephrine in plasma is  <dig>  –  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m  <cit> , we decided to use epinephrine at a supramaximal concentration of  <dig> × 10- <dig> m for the rest of the experiments. in addition to il- <dig>  the enhancing effect of epinephrine was also observed in the production of il- <dig> and il- <dig> from il-1β-induced hmc- <dig> cells .

to measure proatherogenic cytokine gene expression, hmc- <dig> were treated with il-1β, epinephrine, and il-1β plus epinephrine for  <dig> hours and harvested for transcriptional analysis via rt-pcr. il-1β-treated hmc- <dig> showed increased il- <dig> mrna transcription as seen with densitometry, while epinephrine alone appeared to have no effect. when il-1β and epinephrine were added together to hmc- <dig>  il- <dig> mrna expression increased over il-1β treatment alone . the intensities of the cytokine and house keeping gene  bands were measured by densitometry, and the ratio of the cytokine to the house keeping gene was calculated and assigned as the intensity index. the intensity indices for il- <dig> were  <dig>  for the control,  <dig>  for il-1β alone,  <dig>  for epinephrine alone, and  <dig>  for il-1β plus epinephrine. il-1β activated il- <dig> mrna production but epinephrine had no effect on il- <dig> transcripts. il-1β and epinephrine treatment together further increased il- <dig> mrna production . the intensity indices for il- <dig> were  <dig>  for the control,  <dig>  for il-1β alone,  <dig>  for epinephrine alone, and  <dig>  for il-1β plus epinephrine. the results with il- <dig> expression showed the same pattern. il-1β was a good inducer of il- <dig> transcription while epinephrine alone only minimally induced il- <dig> mrna. the combined stimulus of il-1β and epinephrine significantly increased il- <dig> mrna production over that seen with each stimulus alone . intensity indices for il- <dig> were  <dig>  for the control,  <dig>  for il-1β alone,  <dig>  for epinephrine alone, and  <dig>  for il-1β plus epinephrine. to evaluate further the ability of epinephrine to induce il- <dig> transcription at a molecular level, we transiently transfected hmc- <dig> cells with minimal promoter sequences as described in the materials and methods. il-1β at  <dig> ng/ml significantly increased il- <dig> promotor activity as detected by luciferase expression . epinephrine did not enhance il- <dig> promoter activity suggesting that post-transcriptional mechanisms may be involved in the il- <dig> induction. it is likely that epinephrine either prolongs il- <dig> mrna half life and/or enhances il- <dig> secretory processes from the mast cell in response to il-1-stimulation.

enhancing effect of epinephrine on proatherogenic cytokine production from il-1β-induced hmc- <dig> is down regulated by adrenoceptor antagonists
since our previous study has shown that the effect of epinephrine on nitric oxide synthesis is mediated by β-adrenoceptors  <cit> , β-adrenergic receptor antagonists  were used to block the enhancing effect of epinephrine on proatherogenic cytokine production in hmc- <dig>  propranolol  and atenolol  at a concentration of  <dig> × 10- <dig> m did not affect the cell viability in the cultures , nor induced production of il- <dig>  il- <dig> or il- <dig> . when propranolol at  <dig> × 10- <dig> and  <dig> × 10- <dig> m was used in the culture, it significantly reduced the enhancing effect of epinephrine on il- <dig> production . propranolol at  <dig> × 10- <dig> m also significantly reduced the enhancing effect of epinephrine on il- <dig> production , and at  <dig> × 10- <dig> and  <dig> × 10- <dig> m significantly reduced the enhancing effect of epinephrine on il- <dig> production . however, atenolol only significantly reduced the enhancing effect of epinephrine on il- <dig> production , but not on il- <dig> or il- <dig> production .

expression of β <dig> and β <dig> adrenergic receptors on mast cells
in order to further identify whether the enhancing effect of epinephrine on proatherogenic cytokine production is through the β-adrenoceptor, hmc- <dig> cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against β <dig> and β <dig> adrenergic receptors followed by a fitc-labeled second antibody. by flow cytometry analysis, β <dig> and β <dig> adrenergic receptors were found in small amounts on hmc- <dig>  .

enhancing effect of epinephrine on proatherogenic cytokine production from il-1β-induced hmc- <dig> is down regulated by immunosuppressants
since glucocorticoids are very effective treatment strategies for inflammatory disease, dexamethasone was used to determine its effect on atherogenic cytokine production in hmc- <dig>  dexamethasone  alone did not induce proatherogenic cytokine production . however, dex significantly inhibited the enhancing effect of epinephrine on il- <dig> production . the cell viability of the cultures was not different between the medium control  and dex  groups. dex also significantly inhibited the enhancing effect of epinephrine on il- <dig> and il- <dig> production . when dex was included in the il-1β-treatment, it slightly decreased the cytokine production when compared to the il-1β alone, but the decrease was not significant .

role of nf-κb activation in the enhancing effect of epinephrine on proatherogenic cytokine production from il-1β-induced hmc-1
nf-κb is an important transcription factor that mediates the transcription of many proinflammatory cytokine genes. to study the role nf-κb plays in the enhancing effect of epinephrine on proatherogenic cytokine production from il-1β-induced hmc- <dig>  nf-κb activation was analyzed in hmc- <dig> cultures. nf-κb translocation, as seen by a shift in oligonucleotide binding in emsa gels, was not seen in control or epinephrine treated cells . a marked increase of nf-κb nuclear binding activity was observed in samples stimulated with il-1β and il-1β plus epinephrine for one hour but started to diminish after two hours . not only did il-1β plus epinephrine have no further effects on nf-κb translocation over il-1β treatment alone, it seemed to decrease after one and two hours of stimulation.

role of p <dig> mapk activation in the enhancing effect of epinephrine on proatherogenic cytokine production from il-1β-induced hmc-1
because of its importance in cytokine signaling, phosphorylated p <dig> mapk was also assayed. after  <dig> minutes of activation, the hmc- <dig> were lysed to be analyzed for p <dig> activation by western blot. the presence of phosphorylated p <dig> was greatly increased in the epinephrine and il-1β plus epinephrine samples . il-1β alone had small effects on p <dig> activation at this time point while control levels were virtually nonexistent.

enhancing effect of epinephrine on proatherogenic cytokine production from il-1β-induced hmc- <dig> is down regulated by nf-κb and p <dig> mapk inhibitors
to confirm the role of nf-κb and p <dig> mapk in the enhancing effect of epinephrine on proatherogenic cytokine production from il-1β-induced hmc- <dig>  bay  <dig>  an nf-κb inhibitor  <cit> , and sb <dig>  a specific inhibitor of p <dig> mapk  <cit> , were added to the cultures. by themselves, neither bay  <dig>  nor sb <dig>  affected the cell viability of the cultures , nor did they induce proatherogenic cytokine production . however, bay  <dig> and sb <dig> significantly inhibited the enhancing effect of epinephrine on il- <dig> production . bay  <dig> decreased the il-1β-epinephrine induced il- <dig> production but not significantly, however sb <dig> did significantly inhibit the enhancing effect of epinephrine on il- <dig> production . bay  <dig> and sb <dig> significantly inhibited the enhancing effect of epinephrine on il- <dig> production .

discussion
inflammatory cytokines play an important role in atherogenesis. acute phase response  proteins have been demonstrated as risk factors for atherosclerotic heart disease  <cit> . recent studies also suggest a prominent role for the apr in cerebrovascular disease and brain ischemia  <cit> . the apr culminates in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as il- <dig>  tnf-α", and il- <dig> resulting in the synthesis of several proteins including c-reactive protein, fibrinogen, serum amyloid a protein, and ceruloplasmin  <cit> . these cytokines are intimately involved with the stress response  <cit> . these cytokines can also induce transcriptional regulation of complement genes that have been shown to play a role in cardiovascular disease  <cit> . catecholamines are elaborated in stress responses which mediate vasoconstriction and elevate systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. catecholamines induce aggravation of aortic and coronary atherosclerosis in monkeys  <cit>  and play a direct role in atherogenesis and cardiovascular disease  <cit> . thus, it is important to understand the interaction between epinephrine and il-1β with respect to atherogenic cytokine production.

in this study, il-1β, an acute phase cytokine, activated mast cells to produce proatherogenic cytokines, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  in a dose-dependent manner . these results confirm our previous report that il-1β regulates mast cell function  <cit> . these results also show that epinephrine significantly up regulated the il-1β induction of proatherogenic cytokines in mast cells giving new insight into neuronal regulation of the immune system. the gene expression of these proatherogenic cytokines was also increased in il-1β-induced hmc- <dig> cells by addition of epinephrine, suggesting that the enhancing effect of proatherogenic cytokine production is a result of increased cytokine gene transcription . these data provide a novel role for epinephrine in inflammation and atherogenesis.

il-1β signaling probably synergizes with β2-adrenoreceptor-mediated signaling pathways in inducing proatherogenic cytokine production. several reports have shown that the effect of catecholamines on immune function is due to β-adrenoceptors  <cit> . flow cytometry data indicated that hmc- <dig> cells express both β <dig> and β <dig> adrenoceptors in small amounts . the result showed that the enhancing effect of proatherogenic cytokine production by epinephrine is down regulated by β <dig> and β <dig> adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, but not by β <dig> specific adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol, further suggesting the enhancing effect involves β <dig> adrenoceptors . the down regulation by propranolol does not appear to be due to cytotoxicity of the antagonist since there is no difference in viabilities between the propranolol-treated and untreated cell cultures. it was interesting to see that propranolol caused a reduction of production of il- <dig> to an amount that was much lower than that treated with il-1β only . it may be that epinephrine-induced enhancement of il- <dig> production is more sensitive to the propranolol blocking.

activated nf-κb has been demonstrated in atheromatous plaques and has been shown to play a role in atherogenesis  <cit> . to study the mechanism of the enhancing effect of epinephrine on proatherogenic cytokine production from il-1β-induced mast cells, nf-κb and p <dig> mapk activations were investigated. control samples and epinephrine alone samples did not induce nf-κb activation. however, a marked increase in nf-κb activation was observed in samples stimulated with il-1β and il-1β plus epinephrine . nf-κb activation was seen early at one hour and began to fade by two hours. nf-κb also was not increased by the addition of epinephrine to il-1β and even seemed to decrease it at both time points suggesting that nf-κb is needed for cytokine induction but not for the enhancing effect. the presence of phosphorylated p <dig> mapk was greatly increased in the epinephrine and il-1β plus epinephrine samples but only minimally activated with il-1β alone at a  <dig> minute incubation time point . sb <dig> blocked the il-1β and il-1β plus epinephrine effect on il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> expression suggesting that p <dig> plays an important role in signaling from both il-1β and epinephrine. the double stimulation of p <dig>  early by il-1β and later by epinephrine, may explain the enhancing effect on the production of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> in mast cells.

the enhancing effect of epinephrine on proatherogenic cytokine production was also down regulated by immunosupressants, such as dex. dex at the concentration used in this study did not affect the cell viability of the culture, suggesting the down regulation effect of the drugs is not due to toxic effect. dex also slightly, but not significantly, decreased il-1β-induced cytokine production in mast cells . taken all together, these results indicate that β2-adrenoceptor antagonists and glucocorticoids may have clinical potential in stress-mediated disease and atherogenesis.

all the signaling pathways induced by il-1β and epinephrine in mast cells are complex and beyond the scope of this manuscript. however, two important inflammatory pathways, nf-κb and p <dig> mapk, have been shown. il-1β release from immune challenge and epinephrine elevated from stress response can jointly stimulate mast cells to increase il- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> production above that which is seen with either stimulus alone. the exact mechanisms are unclear, but we have shown that il-1β is a strong inducer of nf-κb while epinephrine is a strong inducer of p <dig> mapk. neither nf-κb nor p <dig> mapk was activated further by il-1β plus epinephrine compared to either stimulus alone nor was the promotor activity of il- <dig> increased by the double stimulus as seen by luciferase activity of a il- <dig> reporter gene construct. these data would suggest that il-1β is activating il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> by nf-κb while p <dig> mapk activation is enhancing protein production by inducing other transcription factors, stabilizing the gene mrna, or other forms of post-translational modification. these mechanisms are summarized in fig.  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, stress related catecholamines, such as epinephrine, synergized with il-1β in gene expression and production of proatherogenic cytokines, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> in mast cells. the enhancing effect of proatherogenic cytokine production by epinephrine on il-1β-induced mast cells was down regulated by β-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, and the immunosuppressant dex. these data support a novel role for catecholamines in disorders such as inflammation and atherogenesis. these data also indicate that β-adrenoceptor antagonists and immunosuppressants may be used preventively and therapeutically for modulation of the catecholamine – proatherogenic cytokine axis in disease states.
