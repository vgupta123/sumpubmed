BACKGROUND
a series of pathological changes appear successively within  <dig> h after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. these include pyknosis, degeneration, and edema of neurons and glial cells within  <dig> h, with cell death and edema peaking at  <dig> h  <cit> . these changes were significantly correlated with factors like excessive free radical formation  <cit> , blood–brain barrier  damage  <cit> , amino acid excitotoxicity  <cit> , inflammatory response  <cit> , and intracellular calcium overload  <cit> .

in recent years, several reports have examined the time-course of the development of cerebral ischemia, so as to identify the underlying mechanisms. for example, ubiquitin +  <dig> immunoreactivity markedly increased  <dig> days after ischemia-reperfusion , but became very weak  <dig> days after i-r  <cit> . the expression level of aqp- <dig> decreased quickly after focal cerebral i-r injury, reaching its lowest level 12– <dig> h after reperfusion; then it increased slowly, returning to its normal level  <dig> days after reperfusion  <cit> . mmp- <dig> and gp91phox expression levels were up-regulated in the ischemic hemisphere of the brain tissue after  <dig> min of mcao with  <dig>  h of reperfusion  <cit> . glucokinase  and glucokinase regulatory protein  immunoreactivities in the pyramidal neurons were distinctively decreased in the hippocampal ca <dig> region, but not in ca2/ <dig>   <dig> days after i-r. five days after i-r, gk and gkrp immunoreactivities were hardly detectable in the ca <dig>  but not in ca2/ <dig>  pyramidal neurons; however, at this point in time, gk and gkrp immunoreactivities were detected in astrocytes, not microglia, in the ischemic ca <dig>  <cit> . the level of vegfa mrna increased in the rat brain,  <dig> h after occlusion in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus, after  <dig> h in the cortex and hippocampus, and after  <dig> h in the cortex  <cit> .

previous studies mostly focused on the role of a single molecule or protein. due to the multifaceted pathomechanism of cerebral ischemia, it is unlikely that a single indicator is sufficient to influence the outcomes. thus, a study on the time-dependent pathological mechanism evaluating the role of multiple molecules/proteins in cerebral ischemia is required. our previous study probed the dynamic pathological mechanism and found several important genes and pathways within  <dig> h after cerebral i-r by analyzing the gene expression profiles of ischemia-reperfusion and pathways from the kegg database at  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h in the hippocampus of ischemic mice  <cit> . however, that study paid more attention to individual genes and less attention to the pathways and networks where these genes were not involved. the current study analyzes the mechanism of the pathological changes within  <dig> h after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in the context of pathways and networks of protein molecules. the genego metacoretm software, with its high-quality and manually-curated databases, was used to integrate and visualize the data to glean information about signaling and metabolic pathways and the effects of bioactive molecules  <cit> .

methods
animal model
animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the prevention of cruelty to animals act  and the national institute of health guideline on the care and use of laboratory animals for experimental procedures. the experimental protocol was approved by the ethics review committee for animal experimentation, china academy of chinese medical sciences. one hundred and eighty healthy adult male kunming mice, at  <dig> weeks of age , were obtained from the experimental animal center in health science center of peking university. they were randomly assigned into  <dig> groups: sham, ischemia-reperfused  <dig> h, ischemia-reperfused  <dig> h, and ischemia-reperfused  <dig> h. in the ischemia-reperfused  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups, according to hara’s method  <cit> , the mice were subject to middle cerebral artery occlusion  for  <dig>  h with the use of an intraluminal filament technique, and then reperfused for  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h, respectively, so as to induce focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion models. in the sham group, the external carotid artery  was surgically prepared for the insertion of the filament, but the filament was not inserted. a thermostatically controlled infrared lamp was used during the surgery to maintain body temperature at 37°c. blood pressure, blood gas, brain temperature, eeg and glucose were monitored.

histological analysis
ten mice from each group were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate  and perfused with 4% cold formaldehydum polymerisatum for  <dig> min. then, the mice were executed to get the brains. the brains were further fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for  <dig> h, and embedded in paraffin wax. the paraffin-embedded blocks were cut into a series of  <dig> μm-thick slices, and stained with  <dig> % thionine. the hippocampus ca <dig> region was selected for observation.

measurement of cerebral infarct size by ttc staining
after reperfusion, another  <dig> mice from each group were applied to calculate the infarction volume. the brain was coronally sectioned to  <dig> mm-thick slices and stained with 1%  <dig>   <dig>  5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride  in phosphate buffer  for  <dig> min at 37°c. these slices were refrigerated in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate buffer for  <dig> min at 37°c with light-free. a digital camera  was used to capture the images of these slices. the areas of the infarction region were calculated by a pathology image analysis system  and the ratio of the infarction volume to the total slice was noted.

rna isolation
the total rna of the left hippocampus was extracted respectively from  <dig> mice from each group in trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. then, an rneasy micro kit  was used to further purify and concentrate rna. the quality of rna was evaluated by analyzing the 26s/18s ratio with bioanalyzer microchip .

microarray
hybridization was performed on a microarray containing  <dig> cdnas derived from the cdna library  . each clone was printed as three duplicate spots on a given chip. a single intensity value for each clone was generated through averaging the quadruplet after smoothing spline normalization. all clones used for production of the microarrays were sequence verified. six to nine biological replicates for each group were hybridized. the rna in the sham group was labeled with cy <dig> dutp, and others was labeled with cy <dig> dutp. then the microarrays were hybridized, washed and dried by airing for scanning. image files were processed using the axon genepix 4000b scanner  and datasets were prepared according to the routine procedures using arraytrack software .

microarray data analysis
after robust multiarray analysis and normalization process by genespring, all experimental data were uploaded to the arraytrack system . a one-way analysis of variance  model and significance analysis of microarrays  were conducted to compare the means of altered genes among different groups. the value on the mean of altered gene was calculated based on at least three independent microarrays. we set p <  <dig>  as the statistical significance cutoff. genes with a p-value less than  <dig>  and a fold change greater than  <dig>  were applied for further analysis. the up-regulated or down-regulated differentially expressed gene was defined as the expression level of the gene greater than  <dig> -fold or less than  <dig> -fold, respectively.

pathway analysis
all of the differentially expressed genes were uploaded and mapped to genego database in arraytrack system , which included canonic pathway maps, process networks, gene interactions, and etc. the significance of association between these genes and the canonical pathway was measured in the following  <dig> ways: 1) a ratio calculated using the number of genes from the dataset that maps the pathway divided by the total number of genes that map to the canonical pathway; 2) a p-value, calculated by fischer’s exact test, determining the probability that the association between the genes and canonical pathway was explained by chance alone. the level of statistical significance was set at p <  <dig> . finally, canonical pathways with a p <  <dig>  and a fold change >  <dig>  were screened and analyzed.

network construction and network analysis
the differentially expressed genes list was uploaded to construct and visualize the representative networks for each group using genego metacore™ in arraytrack system . .the networks were generated as the interactions  connecting the input genes . the edges were derived from the genes which had annotated functional interactions in genego database. three algorithms were used to analyze the properties of the networks:  the direct interaction algorithm to map direct gene-gene interactions;  the shortest path algorithm to map the shortest path for interaction between differentially expressed genes; and  the analyze algorithm to deduce top scoring processes that are regulated by differentially expressed genes  <cit> . only the genes in the upload list were contained in the network.

node degree calculation
the node degree means the number of edge linked to the node directly in the network as well as the number of nodes linked to the node. we calculated the degree of node with the equation below: cid=kin−1=∑i∈caijn− <dig> 

any node і in the network, ki is the degree of node i.

similarity among the  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h groups
the jaccard similarity index was used to measure the degree of association among  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h groups. this index considered the similarity among  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h groups as the number of genes shared divided by the total number of genes present in either one of them. it may be expressed as follows: j=c/a+b‐c 

where a is the number of genes present at a time point; b is the number of genes present at another time point; and c is the number of genes present at both time points. the number of genes present in either of the diseases is given by a + b − c.

RESULTS
pathway map analysis of altered genes
after assessing neuronal death at  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h after reperfusion , the metacore™ pathway map analysis of the selected genes was used to identify the statistically significant pathways, based on the calculated p values. the genes activated at  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h are listed in additional file 2: table s <dig>  a total of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> significantly expressed pathways were identified in the  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h groups, respectively. these included  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> non-overlapping pathways in the  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h groups, respectively. eight pathways were overlapped in all the three groups, and several pathways had an overlap between the  <dig> h and 12h groups ,  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups , or  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups  .figure  <dig>

the dynamic change of the tnfr <dig> signaling pathway in  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h groups
the tnfr <dig> signaling pathway was activated across the  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h groups and incidentally, it was the top scoring pathway; however, its constituent genes varied. across the  <dig> time points, jbid, tbid, bid, and ikk-gamma were found to be consistently activated. at  <dig> h, fadd and flash were up-regulated. at  <dig> h, caspase- <dig> and flash were up-regulated . compared with the  <dig> h group, the  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups had more routes to reduce apoptosis response in the tnfr <dig> signaling pathway. the ceramide signaling pathway, which might reduce cell death, was activated at  <dig> h, while caspase cascade was activated rapidly at  <dig> h.figure  <dig>

the dynamic change in apoptosis stimulation by external signals at  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h
the process of apoptosis stimulation by external signals was consistently activated at all the three time points. it was the top-scored process in the  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups, but the fourth-scored process in the  <dig> h group. three overlapping differentially expressed genes were identified among the three groups. two,  <dig>  and  <dig> overlapping genes were detected in paired groups of  <dig> h and  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h, and  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively . a total of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> non-overlapping differentially expressed genes were identified in the  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h groups, respectively.figure  <dig>

jaccard similarity analysis of network
the jaccard similarity index emphasizes the difference of molecular expression at different time points  <cit> . the jaccard index for the network level comparison between  <dig> h and  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h, and  <dig> h and  <dig> h was calculated to be  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively, demonstrating a higher level of similarity between  <dig> h and  <dig> h than that between  <dig> h and  <dig> h. this indicated that the molecular change rate from  <dig> h to <dig> h was higher than that from  <dig> h to  <dig> h.

discussion
to probe the mechanism of ischemia-reperfusion injury, we used the metacore™ software to analyze the overlapping and non-overlapping pathways as well as cellular and molecular network processes, and reconstructed networks at  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h post injury. the number of activated pathways and cellular and molecular processes at different time points was found to be quite different.

several common and unique pathways were observed in the  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h groups. a literature review about ischemia-reperfusion injury revealed a close relationship with  <dig> pathways across time points post injury  <cit> , but g-protein signaling_tc <dig> regulation pathway that was activated at  <dig> h has not been previously reported to have a direct relationship with ischemia-reperfusion injury. studies on the tc <dig> regulation pathway mostly focused on its role in cancer, which mediates its effects via the pi3k-akt pathway, nf-κb, and cyclin d <dig> that are all related with cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury  <cit> . this may be the reason why it has a higher degree in cerebral i-r, and more attention needs to be focused on the role of the tc <dig> regulation pathway in cerebral i-r.

changes in six pathways over time were not consistent with those reported in previous studies, including those involved in cytoplasmic/mitochondrial transport of proapoptotic proteins bid, bmf, and bim, fas signaling cascades, activation of erk by acm <dig>  acm <dig>  and acm <dig>  vegf signaling via vegfr2-generic cascades, mda-dependent postsynaptic long-term potentiation in ca <dig> hippocampal neurons, and g-protein mediated regulation of mark-erk signaling. in previous studies, these pathways were reported to be expressed at all observed time points  <cit> . the disparity between our findings and previously published data may be resulted from the use of different models, different observed time points, different genes, or different tissues.

according to enrichment analysis of pathways at different time points, signal transduction, immune response, and apoptosis were identified as the main molecular processes in the  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h groups. however, several differences were observed amongst these three time points. at  <dig> h, extracellular signals binded to cognate receptors, initiating the immune response. at  <dig> h, apoptosis was triggered by the differential expression of several pathways, as a result of activation by enzymes and signal transduction. at  <dig> h, more pathways were activated, especially the g-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway .figure  <dig> 
visualized dynamic change in the course of pathways at  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h. squares filled with color represent the receptor, while ovals represent the pathway. the content not within squares or ovals represents a pathway that is related to a pathway activated in our study. squares not filled with any color represent a biological function. the red-, blue-, and green-colored squares or ovals represent  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, respectively.



process network analysis revealed that apoptotic and anti-apoptotic pathways existed in both 3h and 12h groups, consistent with the findings from a previous study  <cit> . our study also found that apoptosis existed in the top  <dig> processes at  <dig> h, whereas anti-apoptotic process was absent. both apoptotic and anti-apoptotic processes might determine the prognosis of injured neurons. perhaps at  <dig> h after injury, the anti-apoptotic process was weakened while apoptosis played a leading role, and therefore cell death reached a peak at  <dig> h post injury. these results demonstrate that early treatment that may activate the process of anti-apoptosis within  <dig> h has the potential to decrease cell death. this observation is also supported by other study findings. bcl-xl, belonging to bcl- <dig> family, can inhibit cell death  <cit> . it was differentially expressed at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, but not at  <dig> h, as revealed by analyzing the process of apoptosis stimulation by external signals, which was a pathway common to all three time points. this role of inhibition of anti-apoptotic processes remains to be elucidated.

based on published literature  <cit> , a minority of nodes in a large variety of real world networks is a hub, i.e. a node having a much higher number of neighbors. hub nodes are important components for shared networks, providing more information than non-hub nodes. the degree is a factor to evaluate the hub node, and a higher degree represents a more important node  <cit> . by analyzing the node degree in the network at different time points, pyk <dig>  and pkc were identified to be the most important nodes in the 3h, 12h and 24h groups. pyk <dig>  and pkc, the important proteins in plc/pkc/pyk2/src signaling pathway, can enhance nmda receptor function in hippocampal neurons  <cit> , and nmda receptor may lead to ca2+ internal flow, resulting in cerebral ischemic reperfusion  <cit> . however, other nodes including e2a/hlf fusion protein, tfiid, and grb <dig> have never been implicated in the pathogenesis of i-r previously and merit further investigation to understand their functions. prior studies on e2a/hlf fusion protein mainly focused on its relationship to leukemia; in the context of leukemia, it may induce t-cell apoptosis, and is considered as an very important protein  <cit> . besides, tfiid plays a critical role in rna polymerase ii  pre-initiation complex  formation, and therefore, it may affect the process of transcription during cerebral i-r  <cit> . the relationship between grb <dig> and cerebral i-r may be owed to grb-2-associated binder  <dig> , which is essential in preventing against i-r oxidative injury via mediating survival signaling  <cit> .

overall, most of earlier studies limited their analysis to a detailed investigation of just a few pathways; while our study provides a comprehensive report of the time course of a differential gene expression profile at  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h post cerebral ischemia injury. being a method of systematic analysis, it allows for observing changes across  <dig> different pathways at each time point. such a method can aid in identifying new important pathways, genes, proteins, or cellular processes by tracking dynamic changes over the course of pathogenesis. one caveat of this method is its limitation in further in-depth study of a specific pathway. another limitation is that we only observe the changes in gene expression, which may miss post-translational mechanisms. based on the findings of this study, we propose an in-depth experimental analysis of a few candidate pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
overlapping and non-overlapping pathways and networks demonstrate the sequential changes in the course of molecular pathways in the hippocampus of ischemic mice. based on our data, we propose a hypothesis that early treatment which can activate the process of anti-apoptosis within  <dig> h is essential for decreasing cell death; and this hypothesis should be verified further. to our knowledge, this is the first study to identify one pathway and three genes implicated in cerebral i-r, the roles of which need to be elucidated to understand the pathology of ischemic damages.
