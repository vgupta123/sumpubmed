BACKGROUND
transcripts and protein expression of the ca2+ channel gene are found widely in the cardiovascular system, where the channels play a dominant role in blood pressure regulation
 <cit> . this regulation not only occurs via modulation of peripheral resistance, but also via determination of the arterial compliance, especially in old age  hypertension
 <cit> . it has been shown that l-type ca2+ channel blockers increase vascular compliance of large elastic vessels. as such, they may also be of importance for the pathogenesis and prognosis of cardiovascular complications such as atherosclerosis, left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure
 <cit> . vascular reactivity via l-type ca2+ influx is often studied by increasing the extracellular k+ and depolarizing the cells membrane potential . high k+ induces biphasic contractions in rabbit arteries
 <cit> , rat basilar arterial rings
 <cit>  and mouse aorta
 <cit> , whereby the tonic rise in force is actually accompanied by a decline of intracellular ca2+. this is often attributed to ca2+-sensitization, whereby suppression of myosin light chain phosphatase activity raises contractile force independently of further increases or even decrease in intracellular ca2+ <cit> . in those studies, however, relationships between force and continuous background ca <dig> influx via non-inactivating l-type ca2+ channels were not explored.

indeed, physiological characteristics of l-type ca2+ channels, which have been studied extensively in isolated cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells , are such that voltage-dependent activation and inactivation curves show substantial overlap between − <dig> and −15 mv revealing a time-independent, but voltage-dependent ca2+ influx  in isolated cells
 <cit> . although pharmacological evidence suggested that this window may at least serve as a background ca2+ influx pathway responsible for myogenic tone of small arteries, coronary arteries and microvascular resistance vessels
 <cit> , window ca2+ currents and related window intracellular ca2+ signals have only been determined in voltage-clamped isolated smcs and not in multicellular vascular tissue
 <cit> . the present study used aortic segments of c57bl <dig> mice to investigate relationships between vsmc ca2+ mobilization and isometric contraction with focus on the l-type ca2+ channel window. since electrophysiological voltage-clamp of intact aorta segments was impossible, we decided to clamp the membrane potential at fixed potentials by increasing external k+ concentration. by modulating influx of ca2+ before and during depolarization, we show that not only basal tension, but also the tonic contractile component of c57bl <dig> mouse aortic vsmcs depends on the window l-type ca2+ influx and subsequent ca2+ sensitization mechanisms. these observations may have important consequences for the effects of nitric oxide  on l-type ca2+ influx. recently, we showed that the relaxing efficacy of no in mouse aorta was dependent on the contractile agonist, and more specifically, decreased when the contraction was mainly elicited via l-type ca2+ influx as with elevated extracellular k+, but increased when ca2+ influx was partially inhibited with l-type ca2+ channel blockers
 <cit> .

RESULTS
contraction at depolarized potentials
membrane potentials  in intact mouse aortic vsmcs were k+-dependent and depolarised from −60 mv at  <dig>  mm k+ to −30 mv at 50 mm k+ . hence, elevation of extracellular k+ is a good method to clamp multicellular aortic segments from resting potentials at  <dig>  mm k+ to depolarized potentials. two k+ clamp protocols, as shown in figure
 <dig>  were used; they differed in the relative number of l-type ca2+ channels that can be activated with the subsequent depolarization. in the repetitive protocol , which mimics the depolarizing voltage steps in voltage-clamp experiments of single vsmcs, segments at  <dig>  mm k+ were repetitively exposed to elevated k+ followed by return to  <dig>  mm k+. in this protocol, the number of channels that can be activated by the depolarization step is always the same at the start of the depolarization. in the cumulative protocol , which mimics the variable holding potentials in voltage-clamp experiments in single vsmcs, the segments were depolarized to the subsequent higher k+ concentration without return to  <dig>  mm k+. therefore, with this protocol the relative number of ca2+ channels that can be activated with the subsequent depolarization decreases with higher k+.

isometric force by the repetitive protocol followed a bi-exponential time course, except at 10 mm k+ . amplitude  and velocity of the fast component increased with the k+ concentration . the amplitude of the slow component showed a maximum around 50 mm k+, but then significantly decreased at  <dig> and 124 mm k+ . remarkably, its time constant was independent of external k+ . -force relationships  revealed emax-values of  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mn for fast, slow and steady-state force. ec <dig> values were respectively  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm k+ and were not significantly different.

in the cumulative protocol, two force signals were seen at  <dig> and 20 mm k+: on top of a tonic rise upon depolarization, transient force spikes were observed . these spikes faded away as time progressed , and showed increased frequency, but similar amplitudes at 20 mm k+. at  <dig> and 50 mm k+ these spikes disappeared, but force developed with a fast and slow component. above 50 mm k+ only a small increase  or even a decrease  of force was observed . emax  and ec <dig>  were not significantly different from the steady state values measured with repetitive depolarization .

neurotransmitter release from perivascular nerves did not contribute to the biexponential nature of high k+ contractions or to the k+-dose–response relationships in aortic segments . there was also no evidence of involvement of sarcoplasmic reticulum  ca2+ store ca2+ release. although inhibition of ca2+-induced ca2+ release with 15 μm ryanodine raised basal tension , and inhibited the transient caffeine-induced contraction by more than 50% , 50 mm k+-induced contractions were not affected . similar observations were made for inositoltriphosphate -mediated ca2+ release. contractions by 2 μm phenylephrine  in the absence of extracellular ca2+ were significantly reduced by 50 μm 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate , a blocker of ip3-induced ca2+ release
 <cit>  , whereas contractions by 50 mm k+ were not affected . 

moreover, k+ in ca2+-free kr  or in the presence of 3 μm nifedipine, an inhibitor of l-type ca2+ channels, failed to elicit tension, and addition of nifedipine  to segments constricted with 50 mm k+ caused complete relaxation . finally, inhibition of serca and emptying the intracellular ca2+ stores with 1 μm cyclopiazonic acid  did not affect the contraction by 50 mm k+.

these results indicated that sr ca2+ is not involved in k+-evoked contractions and that fast and slow force components evoked by high k+ were both initiated and sustained by ca2+ influx via vsmc l-type ca2+ channels only.

relationship between force and ca2+ influx
temporal relationships between intracellular ca2+ and isometric force were explored using the cumulative protocol. for k+ elevations from  <dig> to  <dig>  from  <dig> to  <dig> and from  <dig> to 30 mm k+, there was a strict temporal relationship between ca2+ and force . again, there were tonic and phasic contractions , though at slightly higher k+ concentrations . they coincided with phasic ca2+ spikes on top of a tonic rise of ca2+ . both ca2+ and force spikes faded away as time progressed , displayed higher frequency at the subsequent step  and disappeared at holding potentials above 30 mm k+. from  <dig> up to 124 mm k+ the temporal relationships between ca2+  and force  were not clear and during these depolarizations ca2+ decreased whereas force increased .

the deviations between ca2+ and force above 30 mm k+ were studied in greater detail by depolarizing the segments from  <dig>  mm k+ to  <dig> or 124 mm k+. the initial, fast contraction was accompanied by a fast rise in ca2+ . amplitude and velocity of the fast ca2+  and force  components were greater at 124 mm k+ as compared with 50 mm k+ . after reaching a maximum, ca2+ declined faster  and to a lower level at 124 mm k+ than at 50 mm k+, and the slow force increase during the plateau phase was slightly smaller at 124 mm k+.

these results indicate that at  <dig> or 124 mm k+ the slow contraction was actually accompanied by a decline of ca2+, but that there was a good temporal relationship between intracellular ca2+ and force development immediately after the depolarization.

experimental dissection of the ca2+ and force components
at  <dig>  mm k+, removal of extracellular ca2+  decreased basal intracellular ca2+ and force from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ru  and from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mn/mm , indicating baseline ca2+ influx via ca2+ channels in normal conditions. depolarizing the segments with 124 mm k+ in 0ca abrogated ca2+ influx via l-type ca2+ channels and neither contraction nor ca2+ influx was observed. because in the absence of extracellular ca2+ l-type ca2+ channels display normal gating currents
 <cit> , subsequent addition of external ca2+ can evoke ca2+ influx and contraction only if a subpopulation of l-type ca2+ channels is not completely inactivated during the preceding depolarization in 0ca. indeed, re-addition of ca2+ to 0ca caused intracellular ca2+ and force to increase . contrary to the control situation , intracellular ca2+ did not decline during the contraction plateau in the ca2+ re-addition experiments. as a consequence, a clear temporal relationship between the slow ca2+ and force signals was observed  and the force and ca2+ signals could now be dissected in parallel fast and slow components. 

the fast ca2+ and force components that were eliminated in the ca2+ re-addition experiments, could be visualized by pair-wise subtracting ca2+ and force traces from control traces . the differential ca2+ and force signals displayed a similar time-dependency . therefore, figures
 <dig> and
 <dig> illustrate the strict temporal relationships between fast and slow ca2+ and force signals upon depolarization: the fast transient ca2+ increase during depolarization initiates fast force development, whereas a simultaneously activated slower influx of ca2+ is responsible for sustained force development during the plateau phase.

is l-;type ca2+ window current responsible for the slow contraction phase?
an important electrophysiological property of l-type ca2+ channels is that in the voltage range where activation and inactivation curves overlap, they allow a continuous, time-independent ca2+ influx, the so-called window l-type ca2+ channel current
 <cit> . if this current is responsible for the slow contraction phase following addition of external ca2+ to segments depolarized in 0ca, then force should display a bell-shaped concentration-response relationship. figure
 <dig> shows the contractions evoked by re-introduction of ca2+ to 0ca at different k+ concentrations. after 200 s the slow component showed a linear rather than exponential increase with time. force measured at 600 s was maximal at 50 mm k+ and declined at higher k+ concentrations . 

-contraction curves were determined after  <dig>   <dig> and 600 s . at these time intervals, the -contraction curve indeed became bell-shaped. the bell-shape and the complete inhibition with the l-type ca2+ channel blocker, nifedipine  are typical characteristics of the window l-type ca2+ current. the ec <dig> for k+ was time-independent and was respectively  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm . the continuous increase of force with time is presumably due to ca2+ sensitization as intracellular ca2+ reached steady-state after 200 s . further evidence for ca2+ sensitization was provided by rho kinase inhibition with y- <dig> . y- <dig> attenuated depolarization-induced contractions, but inhibition of ca2+ sensitization emphasized the bell shape of the -contraction curve even more. this suggests that the decrease of force at  <dig> and 124 mm k+ was not due to a reduction in sensitivity to ca2+, but was proportional to the window influx of ca2+ via l-type ca2+ channels . similar results were obtained with ha  <dig> .

modulation of l-type window ca2+ influx
changes of vm of the vsmcs or changes of the voltage-dependent parameters of l-type ca2+ channel gating  are expected to affect ca2+ influx and contraction of the segments. segments could be hyperpolarized from −60 mv to the k+ equilibrium potential  of −86 mv at  <dig>  mm k+ with levcromakalim , an opener of atp-dependent k+ channels . the l-type ca2+ channel activation curve can be shifted to hyperpolarized potentials with bay k <dig> , an activator of l-type ca2+ channels
 <cit> . when segments were subjected to increasing k+ concentrations in the presence of levcromakalim, bay k <dig>  or their combination , levcromakalim shifted the curve to higher k+ concentrations , whereas bay k <dig> caused a shift to lower k+ concentrations . both effects were fully additive, indicating independent effects of vm  and l-type ca2+ channel gating  on window contractions. 

at normal extracellular k+, levcromakalim caused a glibenclamide -sensitive decline of intracellular ca2+  and baseline tension , whereas bay k <dig> raised resting intracellular ca2+  and force . the bay effect could be reversed by addition of levcromakalim or nifedipine . to illustrate the physiological importance of the window ca2+ influx for basal contraction of mouse aortic segments, the external k+ concentration was changed to obtain depolarizations or repolarizations within the physiological range of vm for vsmcs . changes of the extracellular k+ between  <dig> and 15 mm and vm between − <dig> and −51 mv caused significant alterations of basal force in control, which could be amplified by adding  <dig> nm bay k <dig> or removed by adding  <dig> nm levcromakalim . these data provide further evidence for the importance of window ca2+ influx within the physiological range of vm or k+ concentrations
 <cit> .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the present study showed that the main determinant of depolarization-induced contractions of the mouse aorta was the influx of extracellular ca2+ via l-type ca2+ channels. thereby, both ca2+ influx and contraction depended on the amplitude of depolarization  and on the resting potential of the vsmc . at resting membrane potentials, elevation of extracellular k+ above 10–20 mm caused biphasic contractions and ca2+ signals. although the relationships between intracellular ca2+ and force appeared to be complex and sometimes non-linear , we demonstrated that the fast, phasic force component was related to a transient ca2+ influx, presumably via a population of l-type ca2+ channels which activated and completely inactivated during the depolarization. on the other hand, the slow, tonic force component displayed a bell-shaped voltage -dependence and could be attributed to voltage-dependent, “steady state” ca2+ influx via a population of l-type ca2+ channels. these channels did not completely inactivate during sustained depolarization and gave rise to a window contraction. in addition to the ca2+ influx via both populations of l-type ca2+ channels, a time-dependent ca2+ sensitization contributed to the depolarization-induced contractions of the mouse aorta.

depolarization-induced contraction is due to activation of l-type ca2+ channels and not to ca2+ release from the sr
as expected
 <cit> , contractions induced by high k+ were mainly due to influx of extracellular ca2+ via l-type ca2+ channels in the mouse aorta. firstly, depolarization in the absence of external ca2+ did not elicit intracellular ca2+ signals or contractions. secondly, selective l-type ca2+ channel blockade  completely inhibited k+-induced contractions. thirdly, bay k <dig>  an agonist of l-type ca2+ channels, increased the k+-sensitivity of the contractions. finally, although intracellular ca2+ release or ca2+-induced ca2+ release through activation of ip <dig> or ryanodine receptors or ca2+ re-uptake to the sr have been shown to contribute to k+-induced contractions
 <cit> , this was not observed in mouse aorta segments . hence, intracellular ca2+ release did not account for the biphasic pattern of high k+-induced force and cai2+ and either phase was solely initiated by l-type ca2+ influx.

relationships between fast and slow contraction phases and ca2+ influx
the contraction elicited by depolarization of vsmcs has been studied extensively
 <cit> , but has never been directly correlated with the known electrophysiological properties of l-type ca2+ channels. l-type ca2+ currents in isolated smcs of various tissues and species display a bell-shaped voltage-dependence with maximal currents at  <dig> to +20 mv
 <cit> . activation  of l-type ca2+ channels starts at − <dig> to −40 mv with half-maximal activation at −30 mv
 <cit> , whereas inactivation starts at −60 mv, is half maximal at about −30 mv and complete at 0 mv
 <cit> . as a consequence, at voltages between current activation  and complete current inactivation , two populations of l-type ca2+ channels are expected to contribute to ca2+ influx and contraction. one population of channels will activate and completely inactivate during the depolarization leading to a transient ca2+ influx and concomitant contraction . this contraction corresponds with the fast phase of contraction as described in figure
1c, where it was elicited by step depolarizations of vm by sudden increase of k+ from  <dig>  mm to values above 20 mm. the physiological importance of these events in vsmcs can be questioned. however, in some experiments , fast time- and voltage-dependent intracellular ca2+ and force spikes appeared on top of a slow rise in tone or ca2+ at  <dig> to 20 mm k+ , which is near the activation voltage of l-type ca2+ channels and within the physiological range of vsmcs vm. as their spiking frequency increased with the amplitude of the depolarization step, fusing to a single fast component at  <dig> and 50 mm k+  similar to the fast component in the step protocol, these events might be related with activation and complete inactivation of l-type ca2+ channels. because they occur at physiological vm of vsmcs, they may have physiological importance. they may be related with the persistent calcium sparklets that are increased in hypertension
 <cit> , with artery vasospasm
 <cit>  or other pathophysiological processes.

however, at all k+ concentrations studied, a variable population of channels will not completely inactivate and will permit “time-independent” ca2+ influx via the so-called voltage window
 <cit> . hence, every depolarization positive to −45 mv  should activate a time-independent, non-inactivating ca2+ influx. following removal of the fast force component by depolarization in the absence of external ca2+ and, then, re-adding ca2+  we demonstrated that this “window” contraction showed a close temporal relationship with the increase of intracellular ca2+ via window l-type ca2+ influx. the electrophysiological characteristics of the l-type ca2+ channel window, i.e. maximal ca2+ influx at −30 mv  and a bell-shaped voltage-dependence are paralleled by a tonic force component which increased with [k+ up to  <dig> or 70 mm , but decreased again above 70 mm k+, leading to a bell-shaped [k+-contraction curve. its voltage range is bounded at negative potentials by channel activation and at more positive potentials by channel inactivation. this agrees with the k + -dependence of the slow force component described in figure
1c and figure
 <dig> 

manipulation of the window ca2+ influx and contraction
our experiments predict that basal force by aortic segments will depend on vm and that changes of vm within the voltage range of the l-type ca2+ channel window will stimulate or inhibit ca2+ influx via l-type ca2+ channels and the concomitant contraction. since removal of extracellular ca2+ led to a decline of intracellular ca2+ and basal tension in the vsmc of the mouse aorta, a “window” ca2+ influx appeared to be operative and functional at resting potentials, which are between − <dig> to −60 mv
 <cit> . as a consequence, a small decrease  or increase  of external k+ modulates basal tension of the mouse aortic segments, probably via closing and opening of l-type ca2+ channels because the effects of k+ changes are emphasized by applying bay k <dig> .

hyperpolarization of vm, as with edhf
 <cit>  or with katp channel openers such as levcromakalim  or cromakalim
 <cit> , or with reduction of extracellular k+ might pull vm out of the window, thereby decreasing l-type ca2+ influx, inducing vasodilatation, elevated arterial compliance
 <cit> , and hypotension. for example, in the present study, levcromakalim, which causes hyperpolarization to vk of −85 mv at  <dig>  mm k+ <cit> , caused a decline of resting intracellular ca2+ and baseline tension, and shifted the [k+-contraction curve to higher k+ concentrations by +6 mm k+ at midpoint.

on the other hand, it is expected that factors causing depolarization of the membrane potential such as intravascular pressure
 <cit> , hypertension
 <cit> , a deficient no release as in enos−/− mice
 <cit> , the absence of trpc <dig> channels
 <cit>  might force the vsmc vm in the l-type ca2+ channel window leading to increased window l-type ca2+ influx, basal constriction, decreased arterial compliance, increased myogenic responses and hypertension.

therefore, results of the present study indicate that the position of the l-type ca2+ channel window along the voltage axis may have profound effects on basal and stimulated ca2+ influx in vsmc, but also predict that shifts of the activation or inactivation curves of l-type ca2+ channels affect vasoconstriction and/or dilatation. for example, bay k <dig>  which shifts the l-type ca2+ channel activation curve to hyperpolarized potentials
 <cit> , caused an increase of basal ca2+ influx and tone . furthermore, bay k <dig> shifted the [k+-response curve to lower k+ concentrations by about 8 mm at midpoint, independent of the presence of levcromakalim, indicating that both the position of the window on the voltage axis and the resting membrane potential determine the window contraction.

finally, because a number of alternatively spliced isoforms of the calcium channel gene protein exist, the l-type ca2+ channel population is not homogeneous. the isoforms display differences in tissue distribution, physiology, pharmacology and disease-related up- and/or down-regulation
 <cit> , but also show altered voltage-dependent activation and inactivation, thereby influencing window currents
 <cit> . hence, changes in the expression of the channel isoforms within the vascular tree
 <cit>  as can occur in hypertension
 <cit>  or atherosclerosis
 <cit>  may affect the position of the l-type ca2+ channel window along the voltage axis with effects on basal and stimulated ca2+ influx and blood vessel tone. moreover, different splice variants can be expressed within a single blood vessel type and depending on the dominance of one or more isoforms, this may determine the electrophysiological properties of the ca2+ channels
 <cit> .

k+-induced ca2+ sensitization
the “window” intracellular ca2+ signal elicited by depolarization reached a steady-state at 200 s, whereas tension increased further at later time intervals. this pointed to a time-dependent and ca2+-dependent ca2+ sensitization, but after normalization of the contractile responses, there was no shift of the curves with time. hence, the time-dependent ca2+ sensitization was proportional to intracellular ca2+, which is mainly determined by the extent of “steady-state” ca2+ influx at each [k+. this is in line with recent data indicating that the depolarization-induced ca2+ sensitization depends on ca2+ entry
 <cit>  and with the results obtained with the rho kinase inhibitors y- <dig> and ha  <dig>  rho-kinase inhibition did not eliminate the bell-shape of the [k+-force curves, but emphasized its voltage-dependence. therefore, both continuous ca2+ influx and ca2+-dependent ca2+ sensitization are necessary to maintain contraction, whereby ca2+ influx occurs independently from ca2+ sensitization, but not vice versa.

limitations of the study
voltage-clamp of multicellular aortic segments with electrophysiological techniques is impossible with current methods because of temporal and spatial voltage heterogeneity. therefore, we clamped the aortic rings with extracellular k+ although the resting vm is not solely determined by the k+ equilibrium potential , especially at low k+ <cit>  . taking into account that levcromakalim hyperpolarized vm of rat mesenteric arteries from − <dig> to −82 mv 
 <cit>  and that in the present study levcromakalim shifted the [k+-force curve by + <dig>  mm k+ at midpoint, vm at normal k+ of  <dig>  mm was calculated to be 19 mv less polarized than vk ; this is in good agreement with resting vm of arterial smcs mentioned in the literature
 <cit>  . at  <dig> and 50 mm k+, the difference between vm and vk further diminished from  <dig> to  <dig> and 3 mv. therefore, clamping the segments with k+ was, in our hands, a good technique to restrain the resting vm of the smcs.
