BACKGROUND
litchi , a member of the sapindaceae, is an important fruit crop that is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. the fruit are fleshy drupes with an edible aril surrounded by the pericarp, which has been the focus of many studies associated with fruit size, coloration, cracking and storability.

substantial changes in color are often evident during fruit maturation and can provide an important indication of maturity and quality in many fruit species  <cit> . for example, in litchi a red color on the fruit surface is commercially desirable, although some litchi cultivars do not have a strong red coloration, mainly due to slow chlorophyll degradation in the pericarp. high concentrations of chlorophylls in the pericarp not only mask the red fruit surface color that is provided by anthocyanins, but also slow their biosynthesis  <cit> . this can be ameliorated to some extent during cultivation by the practice of bagging, which is known to enhance chlorophyll degradation in the litchi pericarp and to promote fruit pigmentation. chlorophyll breakdown contributes to a stronger coloration during fruit ripening as the photosynthetic pigment absorbs much of the incident red light, thus reducing the degree of phytochrome control of anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> . consequently, much higher irradiation is required for anthocyanin synthesis in green tissue compared with etiolated tissue. recently, many steps in the chlorophyll degradation pathway in leaves undergoing senescence have been characterized using mutants with disrupted chlorophyll degradation  <cit>  and chlorophyll catabolism enzymes  and the stay green  protein have been shown to play a prominent role  <cit> . in addition, studies of kiwifruit  have indicated that genes involved in chlorophyll degradation, such as sgr <dig>  are expressed at higher levels in golden fresh cultivar than in a green cultivar, resulting in earlier and more sustained chlorophyll degradation  <cit> . however, chlorophyll degradation in many fruit species is still poorly understood.

anthocyanins are examples of flavonoids, the biosynthetic pathways of which have been extensively studied not only because they result in the production of red, blue and black plant pigments, but also in the contexts of their diverse roles in uv protection and pathogen defense, as well as their nutritional value in the human diet  <cit> . the red pericarp color of litchi fruit is known to result from anthocyanin accumulation  <cit> , and the pericarp also contains an abundance of phenolic compounds , which inhibit fat acid oxidation and act as free radical scavengers  <cit> . of these, oligonol, a polyphenolic compound containing catechin-type monomers and short oligomers of proanthocyanidin, has been particularly noted to have health benefits  <cit> . however, pericarp browning, a phenomenon that can have a highly negative effect on fruit quality and shelf life, can be attributed to the oxidation of phenolics  <cit> . thus, the study of the biosynthesis and metabolism phenolic compounds and flavonoids in the pericarp of litchi fruit has considerable potential commercial value for a number of reasons.

studies to date have identified two basic classes of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis: structural genes of the flavonoid pathway that are common to a range of species, and regulatory genes that modulate the activity of the biosynthetic genes, thereby controlling the spatial and temporal accumulation of the pigments  <cit> . examples of both classes of genes have been identified and characterized from many fruit species  <cit> . anthocyanin biosynthesis in the pericarp of litchi shows cultivar, developmental and environmental associated variation  <cit>  and both a structural gene  and a transcription factor  have been shown to play major roles in these differences  <cit> . however, only one gene member in each multigene family of the structural genes in litchi flavonoid biosynthesis has been reported to date and transcription factors  that have been shown to interact with members of the myb tf family to regulate the biosynthesis of flavonoids, such as basic helix-loop-helix  tfs and the wd <dig> protein  <cit>  have not yet been characterized in litchi.

chlorophyll degradation, anthocyanin accumulation, increase in membrane permeability, and cell wall disassembly have all been suggested to coincide with the onset of litchi maturation  <cit> , but the specific factor that triggers this important transition in litchi fruits is still unknown. previous studies have demonstrated a differential effect of aba and ethylene on litchi pericarp coloration. aba is suggested to be more important in anthocyanin synthesis, while ethylene thought to have a more significant role in chlorophyll degradation  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms that control the maturation of these non-climacteric fruits remains to be elucidated.

a particularly limiting factor in this regard, and indeed in advancing litchi fruit research at the molecular level has been the scarcity of gene sequence information, and even the most comprehensive studies to date typically have considered only a few hundred gene sequences  <cit> . recent advances in rna-seq transcriptome profiling technologies based on ngs  have enabled a powerful platform to address questions involving complex patterns of gene expression such as those listed above. moreover, rna-seq analysis facilitates research using species without a published genome sequence, such as litchi, by providing massive sequence data sets for molecular marker development, gene discovery, transcriptional analysis, and pathway enrichment analysis. in this context digital gene expression  is a tag-based transcriptomic sequencing approach in which the expression levels of genes can be measured by counting the number of expressed sequence tags  derived from each specific gene, enabling the assessment of expression levels between samples or during developmental processes  <cit> .

in this study, a cdna library of litchi pericarp was constructed and  <dig>  unigenes were assembled based on illumina rna-seq data. a total of  <dig>  gb was used for de novo transcriptome assembly, resulting in a comprehensive data set for the identification of genes corresponding to the major metabolic pathways in the pericarp of litchi. global gene expression profiles, focusing mainly on chlorophyll degradation and flavonoid biosynthesis, during fruit development were analyzed using a dge strategy. in addition, structural and regulatory genes associated with pericarp coloration were identified. this data set will serve as a platform to advance the understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying the development of litchi fruit and possibly those of other non-climacteric fruits.

RESULTS
chlorophyll and flavonoid levels in the pericarp of three developmental stages of litchi fruit
as the litchi fruit developed, two major physiological changes, degreening and pigmentation were visually apparent  and these coincided with changes in the abundance of chlorophyll, total flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, and anthocyanins in the pericarp . we determined that more than half of the chlorophyll breaks down within 10 days in parallel with an obvious degreening at 62 days after anthesis . chlorophyll levels then continued to decrease but at a reduced rate as fruit developed toward full maturity . total flavonoid and proanthocyanidin levels decreased during fruit development. no anthocyanins were detected in the green pericarp ; however, low levels accumulated in the yellow pericarp and the content increased substantially through the rest of development, giving rise to a characteristic red pigmentation.figure  <dig>

library construction
after removal of adaptor sequences, ambiguous reads and low-quality reads , a total of  <dig> , <dig> high-quality filtered reads of 75-bp length, comprising  <dig> , <dig>  nucleotides  was obtained. all high-quality reads were de novo assembled into  <dig>  contigs , with a n <dig> of  <dig>  bp. after paired-end joining and gap-filling, these contigs were then assembled into  <dig>  unique sequences with a mean size of 737 bp. the size distributions of these contigs and unigenes are shown in additional file  <dig> 

annotation of predicted proteins
approximately  <dig>  unique sequences were annotated based on blastx  searches of four public databases: the ncbi non-redundant  database, the swiss-prot protein database, the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database, and the cog database . of these,  <dig>  unique sequences were annotated with reference to the nr database, while  <dig>  unigenes were annotated using the other databases.figure  <dig>

based on the nr annotations, 29% of the annotated sequences had ‘very strong homology’ , 22% had ‘strong homology’  and 49% had ‘homology’ , to available plant sequences . 32% of the unique sequences had top matches to sequences from grape , with additional hits to soybean  sequences , medicago truncatula sequences , populus trichocarpa sequences , and arabidopsis thaliana sequences  .

a total of  <dig>  cds  were identified using blastx against the databases mentioned above, and an additional  <dig>  unigenes were predicted using the estscan program, so the direction and region of these genes could be determined and their sequences be translated into peptide sequences, of which  <dig>   had a length over  <dig> aa. the detailed length distribution is shown in additional file  <dig> 

functional classification
the go, kegg and cog databases were used to classify the functions of the predicted litchi pericarp unigenes. approximately  <dig>  unigenes were classified into three main categories: ‘biological process’, ‘cellular component’ and ‘molecular function’ . within the ‘cellular component’ category, a large number of unigenes were annotated as ‘cell and organelle’, while the major groups within the ‘biological process’ category were ‘metabolic process’ , ‘cellular process’  and ‘response to stimulus’ . in the ‘molecular function’ category, ‘binding’  and ‘catalytic activities’  were the two most abundant subcategories.figure  <dig>

a total of  <dig>  unigenes were mapped onto  <dig> kegg pathways. the maps with highest unigene presentation were ribosome , followed by rna transport , plant hormone signal transduction  and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum . the pathways with highest presentation were purine metabolism , starch and sucrose metabolism , pyrimidine metabolism  and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis  . lastly, the cog database is used to classify orthologous proteins. every protein in the cog database is assumed to have evolved from an ancestor and the database includes the amino acid sequences for protein encoding genes derived from complete genome sequences as well as the evolutionary relationships of bacteria, algae and eukaryotes  <cit> . these data are therefore useful for protein classification and studies of evolutionary rates. as shown in additional file  <dig>  group k , group l , group o  and group t  are the four most abundant groups represented in the litchi data set, indicating that pericarp maturation involves substantial amounts of both transcriptional and post-translational regulation of gene expression and function.

dge library sequencing and sequence mapping to the transcriptome database
changes in gene expression in the pericarp of the three fruit developmental stages were analyzed using rna-seq. three dge libraries  were sequenced to generate approximately  <dig> million filtered reads per library. the total number of mapped reads in each library ranged from  <dig> - <dig>  million and the percentage of these reads mapped to the de novo assembled transcriptome ranged from 73-83%. of these the number of uniquely matched reads ranged from  <dig> - <dig>  million . the random distribution of reads matching the reference genes was assessed and most reads were found to be evenly distributed throughout the transcriptome . all three rna-seq libraries showed similar patterns of distribution of unique reads among the different read abundance categories .table  <dig>

differential gene expression between three stages of coloration
differences in gene expression in the pericarp at three coloration stages  were assessed and degs were identified by pairwise comparisons of the three libraries with the expression fold  and false discovery rate  as the thresholds . a total of  <dig>  genes were found to be significantly differentially expressed in the pair-wise comparisons between any two stages, with  <dig>  degs  between the green and yellow libraries . a total of  <dig>  degs were detected between the yellow and red libraries, with  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated . finally, the greatest number of differentially expressed genes occurred between the green and red libraries, with  <dig>  down-regulated and  <dig>  up-regulated . of all the degs,  <dig> genes were found to be significantly differentially expressed among all three coloration stages .figure  <dig>

we used the stem  software package to cluster our filtered dge data into  <dig> distinct expression patterns  to identify genes with similar expression patterns, and that might therefore be functionally correlated. clusters  <dig> to  <dig> include a broad range of genes belonging to the ‘metabolic processes’, ‘cellular processes’, ‘responses to stimulus’ and ‘biological regulation’ categories. the ‘biological process’ distribution frequency was calculated for each cluster to identify differences in the distribution of genes among three coloration stages . among the  <dig> clusters, clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had a statistically significant number of genes assigned. cluster  <dig> contained genes negatively modulated during pericarp coloration, while cluster  <dig> contained genes with a positive correlation. cluster  <dig> contained  <dig> genes, whose expression levels decreased sharply from the green to the yellow stage, but subsequently increased significantly from the yellow to the red stage.figure  <dig>

the  <dig> degs shared between all three coloration stages were further analyzed  and arranged into  <dig> groups , which collectively showed three different patterns. genes in groups  <dig> and  <dig> were up-regulated from the green to the yellow stage, but down-regulated from the yellow to the red stage. group  <dig> contained  <dig> genes, including a beta-galactosidase, a peroxidase and a thioredoxin gene, while group  <dig> contained  <dig> genes , which encoded proteins including cytochrome p <dig>  cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinase, wrky domain class tfs and sesquiterpene synthase. in groups  <dig> and  <dig>  genes were highly expressed at the green stage but significantly down-regulated at the yellow and the red stages. group  <dig> comprised  <dig> genes , which encoded proteins such as laccase, tonoplast intrinsic protein , tcp like transcription factor and vegetative storage protein and group  <dig> was the second largest group, with  <dig>  genes, including cellulose synthase, cytochrome p <dig>  laccase, polygalacturonase, beta- <dig> -xylosyltransferase and lipoxygenase. the genes in groups  <dig> and  <dig> belonged to the third developmental pattern, with a low expression at the green and the yellow stages but a dramatic up-regulation at the red stage. group  <dig> genes included sesquiterpene synthase, terpene synthase, homogentisate geranylgeranyl transferase and an ap2/erf domain-containing tf. the largest group  comprised  <dig>  genes, including those encoding proteins associated with anthocyanin biosynthesis and transport such as udp-flavonoid glucosyl transferase , chalcone synthase , glutathione s-transferase , an anthocyanin related myb tf, stress response proteins such as a tify family gene, cmpg <dig>  metallothionein-like protein, and allene oxide cyclase, fruit ripening related proteins, such as an ethylene-responsive tf and gretchen hagen  <dig> , and post-transcriptional modification and signal transduction proteins such as mapk, mapkkk, e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase, a gras family tf and the rem <dig>  remorin protein. six nac tfs were also present in this group, indicating an important role of this tf family in litchi pericarp maturation, as were a r2r3-myb tf, a wd40-repeat protein, a bhlh protein, and a cbf tf. we also identified  <dig> transcripts that had no functional annotation in any database.figure  <dig>

genes involved in chlorophyll degradation
one of the most distinct developmental changes in the pericarp of litchi is degreening, which results from rapid chlorophyll degradation. in land plants, chlorophyll is broken down to colorless linear tetrapyrroles in a highly conserved multi-step pathway termed the ‘pao pathway’ ; so named because the opening of the chlorin macrocycle present in chlorophyll is catalyzed by pheophorbide a oxygenase   <cit> . in the present study, eleven candidate genes related to chlorophyll degradation were identified from the litchi pericarp transcriptome database, including genes encoding chlorophyll catabolic enzymes, non-yellow coloring , chlorophyllase , hydroxy-chl a reductase , pheophytinase , pheide a oxygenase , and red chl catabolite reductase , and a stay green protein . the expression patterns were showed in figure 7b. the expressions of unigene  <dig>  and unigene  <dig>  were similar, with the lowest expression at the green stage, moderate expression at the yellow stage, and highest expression at the red stage. the opposite pattern was seen for unigene  <dig> , whose expression decreased during pericarp coloration. for nyc, clh and pao, more than one gene was identified and the different gene family members displayed different expression patterns in all cases. the expression of unigene  <dig> , unigene  <dig> , and unigene  <dig>  decreased sharply from the green to the yellow stage before showing up-regulation as fruit reached full maturity. the expression of the remaining genes belonging to these families remained relative stable throughout fruit coloration.figure  <dig>

in this current study, the expression of unigene  <dig>  and unigene  <dig>  correlated with the degradation of chlorophylls during pericarp coloration. transient expression of litchi sgr and pph in nicotiana benthamiana leaves showed different results. distinct chlorophyll lost and a sharp decrease of chlorophyll fluorescence ratio from  <dig>  to  <dig>  were observed in n. benthamiana leaves transiently expressing litchi sgr, while no obvious degreening was noticed upon transient expression of litchi pph . previous reports have indicated that sgr is essential for the initiation of chlorophyll breakdown in plastids by recruiting chlorophyll catabolism enzymes in senescing chloroplasts  <cit> . for example, after transient expression of kiwifruit  pph <dig>  pao <dig>  sgr <dig> or sgr <dig> in expanding n. benthamiana leaves, only sgr <dig> and sgr <dig> caused chlorophyll degradation  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis indicated that litchi sgr is closely related to adsgr <dig>  the kiwifruit sgr <dig> protein . we conclude that, similar to adsgr <dig>  litchi sgr is a key senescence-induced chlorophyll degradation regulator.figure  <dig>

genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis
flavonoid biosynthesis is a highly studied plant secondary metabolism and thirteen enzymes are known to be involved in this pathway . in this current study, we identified  <dig> candidate transcripts participating in each step of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway . two distinct expression patterns were noticed among the seven phenylalanine ammonia lyase  genes. the transcription levels of unigene  <dig>  unigene  <dig>  unigene  <dig> and unigene  <dig> were low in green pericarp, but highly expressed in the red pericarp. the opposite expression pattern was observed for unigene  <dig>  unigene  <dig> and unigene  <dig> and two genes  corresponding for cinnamate 4-hydroxylase  displayed different expression patterns, with the expression level of the former being approximately  <dig> times higher than that of the latter during fruit coloration. moreover, the highest expression of unigene  <dig> was detected in red pericarp while that of unigene  <dig> was detected in green pericarp. five 4cl genes were identified, of which the expression of unigene  <dig> was lowest at the yellow stage and highest at the red stage, while highest expression of unigene  <dig> occurred at the green stage and the remaining gene family members showed relatively constant expression during coloration. three chalcone synthase  genes  were identified in the litchi pericarp transcriptome. the nucleotide sequence of unigene  <dig> showed 99% identity with that of a previously reported litchi chs gene, lcchs   <cit> . up-regulation of unigene  <dig> and unigene  <dig> expression was evident during coloration, while the expression level of unigene  <dig> was the lowest of the three chs genes and a change during developmental was less apparent. two genes  encoding chalcone isomerase  were also identified, both of which showed highest the expression at the red stage. flavanone 3-hydroxylase  and flavanone 3′-hydroxylase  had similar expression patterns and were down-regulated during the transition from green to yellow pericarp and then further up-regulated as the fruit reached maturity. another f3h  showed low expression at the yellow stage but high expression at the green and red stages.figure  <dig> 
simplified scheme  and a heat map of the expression of genes  related to flavonoid biosynthesis. enzyme names are abbreviated as follows; pal, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; c4h, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase; 4cl,  <dig> coumarate coa ligase; chs, chalcone synthase; chi, chalcone isomerase; f3h, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; f3′h, flavanone 3′-hydroxylase; dfr, dihydroflavonol reductase; fls, flavonol synthase; ans/ldox, anthocyanidin synthase/leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase; ufgt, udp-flavonoid glucosyltransferase; anr, anthocyanidin reductase; and lar, leucoanthocyanidin reductase. enzyme names, unigene ids and expression patterns are indicated on the right of each step.



the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway is usually divided into two parts: the early and the late sections  <cit> . the early section lead to the formation of the dihydro-flavonols, comprising pal, c4h, 4cl, chs, chi and f3h, while the late stages of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway include three key enzymes dihydroflavonol reductase , anthocyanidin synthase  and udp-flavonoid glucosyltransferase . two of the degs, unigene  <dig> and unigene  <dig> encode predicted dfr and their expression levels increased during coloration. only one gene  encoding an ans was found, and its expression was slightly up-regulated from the green to the yellow stage and then substantially up-regulated from the yellow to the red stage. five genes encoding ufgt were identified. of these, unigene  <dig>  unigene  <dig> and unigene  <dig> showed >97% identity to the known litchi udp-glucose: flavonoid glucosyltransferase sequences in public database   <cit> . however, the rest two unigenes  showed around 70% identity to pear udp-galactose: flavonoid galactosyltransferase sequence   <cit> . increasing expression that correlated with the accumulation of anthocyanins in three transcripts  was noticed, while the expressions of other two ufgt  were highest at the green stage.

genes encoding enzymes involved in other subgroups of flavonoid end products were also investigated. for example, four genes specifically participating in proanthocyanidin biosynthesis, encoding leucoanthocyanidin reductase  and anthocyanidin reductase , were identified in the litchi database. unigene  <dig> was up-regulated during fruit development, while the expression of unigene  <dig> was up-regulated slightly early in ripening, but decreased during the transition from the yellow to the red stage. the two anr genes showed same expression pattern, with decreasing transcript accumulation from the green to the yellow stage but a substantial up-regulation from yellow to red pericarp. two flavonol synthase genes, unigene  <dig> and unigene  <dig>  were also identified: the expression of the latter increased during fruit maturation while the expression of the former was lowest at the yellow stage.

coefficient analysis between rna-seq and real-time pcr
to verify the results obtained from the rna-seq profiling, the expression of fifteen selected genes from the chlorophyll degradation and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways at the three coloration stages were analyzed by real-time pcr in three biological replicates. the real-time pcr data for these genes were generally consistent with the rna-seq results. linear regression  analysis showed an overall correlation coefficient of  <dig> ** , which indicated that the results of transcriptome analysis were consistent with those of real-time pcr. the real-time pcr value and rpkm value for the fifteen genes are shown in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig>

candidate myb transcription factors for flavonoid biosynthesis regulation
a phylogenetic tree was constructed using a. thaliana myb tf family members, candidate litchi myb family members and myb transcription factors that control anthocyanin, proanthocyanidin and flavonol accumulation in other plant species . of the  <dig> r2r3-mybs presented in the litchi data set, unigene  <dig> was clustered with the tfs known to be involved in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis. this unigene encodes a protein with 99% amino acid sequence similarity to lcmyb <dig>  which has been reported to control litchi fruit anthocyanin formation  <cit> . unigene  <dig> and unigene  <dig> were in the same sub-family as a transcriptional repressor famyb <dig>  <cit> , while unigene  <dig> and unigene  <dig> were with ph <dig> and vvmyb5b, which are genes that potentially regulate anthocyanin and  proanthocyanidin biosynthesis  <cit> . similarly, unigene  <dig>  unigene  <dig>  unigene  <dig> and unigene  <dig> clustered with attt <dig>  vvmybpa <dig> and dkmyb <dig>  candidate genes for proanthocyanidin biosynthesis regulation, and unigene  <dig> and unigene  <dig> clustered with atpfg2/atpfg <dig>  which regulates flavonol accumulation  <cit> . other litchi myb tfs belonging to each of the a. thaliana myb sub-families are also shown in additional file  <dig> 

discussion
de novo assembled the pericarp transcriptome during coloration
at present no genomic data is available for litchi and only a few hundred cdna sequences have been published as a public resource  <cit> ; thus more sequence information will be helpful for researches studying this species. next generation sequencing  is a fast and effective means to generate transcriptome datasets and high resolution transcriptomic analysis is proving to be of great value for functional genomic study of non-model species  <cit> . in this current study, a de novo transcriptome of the pericarp of litchi was assembled based on short-read  sequencing. in total,  <dig>  unigenes were assembled with a mean length of 737 bp, which is considerably longer than the previously reported 601 bp for mixed litchi transcriptome  <cit> , 531 bp for chinese bayberry   <cit>  and 508 bp for chinese white pear   <cit> . approximately 68% of the unigenes were annotated with reference to the nr database, indicating that about one third of the sequences have no apparent homologs, some of which are likely genes with novel functions. in this regard, the transcriptomes of non-model plants, such as chinese berry   <cit> , salvia miltiorrhiza  <cit> , and litchi, will serve as important datasets for studies of taxa specific phenomena.

the rna-seq analysis revealed that the numbers and expression profiles of degs differed at coloration stages and  <dig>  degs between the last two developmental stages were identified. interestingly, this number is similar to that reported for tomato fruit ripening  <cit> . the amount of information obtained from rna-seq analysis was, not surprisingly, much larger than that generated using a suppression subtractive hybridization  approach, where only  <dig> unique genes were identified from a litchi floral bud ssh library  <cit> . we identified  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  degs between green and yellow, yellow and red, and green and red stages, respectively . these degs were clustered into  <dig> distinct expression patterns, of which cluster  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> had substantial number of genes, indicating three major gene expression profiles during the pericarp maturation of litchi .

candidate genes involved in pericarp maturation of litchi
in this study,  <dig> tfs were shown to exhibit increasing expression levels during pericarp maturation  and, of particular note, six nac tf genes were significantly differentially expressed. nacs comprise a plant-specific tf family with diverse roles in development and stress regulation. for example, non-ripening , a nac protein, is necessary for tomato fruit ripening  <cit> . the a. thaliana protein atnac <dig> was found to regulate flavonoid biosynthesis under high-light  <cit>  and we propose that nac tfs are similarly involved in maturation of the litchi pericarp. ethylene response factors  that regulate apple and kiwifruit fruit ripening have been reported  <cit>  and we identified three erfs in this study that showed differential expressed during litchi pericarp maturation. although litchi is a non-climacteric fruit, increasing ethylene production has been detected in degreening litchi cultivars and application of the ethylene-releasing chemical ethrel to litchi was effective in enhancing the degradation of chlorophyll in the pericarp  <cit> . thus these litchi erfs may be involved in regulating physiological changes during pericarp maturation. we also identified a range of tfs, including members of the myb, wd-repeat protein and bhlh families, which yielded no functional annotation after searching ncbi database and these will be the targets of future study.

in addition to tfs, putative signaling factors that are associated with fruit ripening were identified. mapk signal transduction modules played important roles in regulating many biological processes in plants  <cit> . in the present study, three genes  encoding putative mapks were significantly up-regulated during pericarp maturation. it was reported that an apple mapk and mapkkk are involved in abscisic acid  signal transduction  <cit>  and it was known that aba plays a crucial role in litchi fruit pigmentation  <cit> . thus we hypothesize that the mapks identified in this study may play important roles in the maturation of litchi fruit. two e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase genes  were also significantly differentially expressed, indicating the importance of post-transcriptional modification during litchi pericarp maturation. unigene  <dig> encodes a gh <dig> with a high degree of sequence similarity to longan  dlgh <dig>  and dlgh <dig> , both of which are associated with pericarp growth and fruit maturation  <cit> .

the pivotal role of sgr in chlorophyll degradation
the degradation of chlorophylls is essential for the strong coloration of fruit crops and a degreening process associated with chlorophyll degradation was observed during litchi coloration . approximately 80% of the total chlorophyll content was degraded during the pericarp change from the green to the yellow stage. during this period, the expression of putative chlorophyll degradation genes, including two nycs, three clhs, one hcar, two paos and one rccr, showed a reduction in expression. in contrast, pheophytinase gene  exhibited an increase in transcript levels in the pericarp in parallel with chlorophyll degradation. recent studies of leaf senescence in a. thaliana and rice showed that pph is senescence induced, and that it specifically dephytylates the mg-free chlorophyll pigment pheophytin , such that the mutant of pph exhibits a stay green phenotype  <cit> . however, we observed that transient expression of litchi pph in n. benthamiana leaf had no obvious effect on chlorophyll degradation , a result that is consistent with a similar study of a kiwifruit pph  <cit> .

stay green , a chloroplast localized protein, is not a chlorophyll catabolic enzyme, although it regulates chlorophyll degradation and is required for its initiation  <cit> . unigene  <dig> was the only sgr gene found in the litchi transcriptome database and its expression was observed to increase in parallel with chlorophyll degradation during the developmental transition from the green to the red stage . this expression pattern was similar to that of sgr <dig> from kiwifruit, which was expressed at much higher levels in gold fruit than in green fruit  <cit> . when the sgr genes from kiwifruit were over-expressed in tobacco leaves, degreening was observed  <cit> . in the present study, when the isolated litchi sgr gene was transiently expressed in n. benthamiana leaves, degreening and a sharp decrease of fluorescence ratio were observed . these results indicate that this sgr is a key gene in chlorophyll loss in the litchi pericarp during maturation. recently, a study revealed that sgr regulate lycopene accumulation through direct interaction with a key carotenoid synthetic enzyme slpsy <dig> during tomato fruit development  <cit> . however, its mode of action remains unknown.

structural and regulatory genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis
anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins and flavonols are the predominant flavonoids in the litchi pericarp   <cit> . genes participating in each step of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway were found in the transcriptome dataset, indicating that it has high coverage. many of these responsible appeared to have several family members, implying that one or more rounds of genome duplication may have occurred during litchi genome evolution. the biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanins has been well characterized in fruit species, such as apple  <cit> , chinese bayberry  <cit> , and grape  <cit> . some genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis identified in this study had high similarity to known flavonoid biosynthesis genes, including chs , chi , f3h , ans  and ufgt   <cit> . while some genes displayed low similarity to known genes suggests that there are new putative genes contributing to this pathway in this transcriptome.

we identified genes encoding enzymes from a broad range of steps in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. for example, pal catalyzes the initial step of the phenylpropanoid pathway, which leads to the synthesis of both lignin and flavonoids. pal is generally encoded by a small gene family: three ccpals from coffea and five ptpals from populus trichocarpa have been characterized and some family members displayed different expression patterns, suggesting divergent functions  <cit> . transcripts corresponding to seven pal genes with differential expression patterns during litchi pericarp coloration detected . five 4cls and two c4hs with differential expression patterns were also identified and higher expression of chs genes and chi genes were observed in the red stage. chs proteins have multiple functions, such as protection from uv radiation, defense against pathogens, pigment biosynthesis and pollen fertility  <cit> . chalcone isomerase-like protein from japanese morning glory enhances both flavonoid production and flower pigmentation, while tomato slchi <dig> was found to have a key role in terpenoid production  <cit> . the increased expressions of chs, chi and f3h genes do not correlate exactly with the decreased concentration of total flavonoids during pericarp coloration. this was probably due to the complicate composition of flavonoids. in the pericarp of litchi, the decrease of total flavonoids mainly result from the drop of proanthocyanins during coloration . further study is needed to clarify the functions of these genes form litchi.

dfr, ans and ufgt are late anthocyanin biosynthetic genes, which are coordinately expressed during red coloration in apple skin, where their levels of expression positively correlate with anthocyanin concentration  <cit> . in this study, other than the ufgt genes unigene  <dig> and unigene  <dig>  these late structural genes showed the highest expression levels in the pericarp with the highest anthocyanin concentration . similar to the situation with mangosteen, ufgt is considered to be a key enzyme in litchi anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> . of the five ufgt genes, the expression levels of unigene  <dig>  unigene  <dig> and unigene  <dig> increased in parallel with the accumulation of anthocyanins during fruit coloration. in vitis vinifera, seven ufgt genes contribute to the chemical diversity of bioactive flavonol glycosides  <cit> . in the present study, the expressions of unigene  <dig> and unigene  <dig> were not paralleled with the accumulation of anthocyanins. as mentioned earlier, these two unigenes showed high identity with udp-galactose: flavonoid glycosyltransferase in pear  <cit> . these results suggested that unigene  <dig> and unigene  <dig> might be other glycosyltransferases for other flavonoids.

glutathione s-transferase  is necessary for the transport of anthocyanins from the cytosol to the vacuole and the a. thaliana gst mutant tt <dig> accumulates extremely low levels of anthocyanins  <cit> . gsts that are responsible for anthocyanin transport have also been identified in grape berry  <cit> . in the present study, a gst gene  was found significantly up-regulated during litchi pericarp coloration.

the synthesis of proanthocyanidins and flavonols share common biosynthesis steps with anthocyanin. anthocyanidin reductase  and leucoanthocyanidin reductase  play important roles in the biosynthesis of proanthocyanidins, while flavonol synthase  is specifically involved in the biosynthesis the flavonols catechin and epicatechin  <cit> . indeed, a close relationship between anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin accumulation has been noticed. over-expression of anr and lar in tobacco results in both a decrease in anthocyanin levels and an increase in the concentration of proanthocyanidins in flower  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  proanthocyanidin levels decreased coincident with an increase in anthocyanin abundance during litchi pericarp coloration. however, two anr genes and one of the two lar genes showed the highest expression in red pericarp, the stage with the lowest proanthocyanidin concentration.

in plants, myb tfs typically comprise large families which collectively function in a wide variety of plant-specific processes, as has been shown by extensive functional characterization in a. thaliana  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> litchi r2r3-myb tfs were identified as being expressed in the fruit pericarp. as has been reported for many other fruits, r2r3-myb tfs and anthocyanin biosynthetic genes are coordinately expressed during ripening coincident with anthocyanin accumulation  <cit> . lcmyb <dig> has been reported to control anthocyanin biosynthesis in litchi  <cit>  and myb tfs have also been shown to regulate the biosynthesis of flavonol and proanthocyanidins in a. thaliana and gentian flowers  <cit> . moreover, tt <dig>  a myb tf, activates ban  expression and enhances proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in seed coat of a. thaliana  <cit> , while vvmybpa <dig>  vvmybpa <dig> and vvmyb5b were shown to regulate anthocyanin and  proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in developing grape berries  <cit> . however, strawberry famyb <dig> was reported to suppress anthocyanin and flavonol accumulation in transgenic tobacco lines and over-expression of this gene inhibited the biosynthesis of proanthocyanidins in the leaves of lotus corniculatus  <cit> . these results suggested the multiple and complex functions of myb tfs. in this current study,  <dig> litchi myb tfs were shown to align within the same sub-group with gene known to be involved in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in other plant species , from which we infer that those genes may have similar functions in regulating the accumulation of flavonoids in the litchi pericarp. these genes will the target of future researches into the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in litchi.

CONCLUSIONS
the pericarp of litchi has been the focus of studies associated with fruit size, coloration, cracking and shelf life. in this study, an analysis of the transcriptome of litchi pericarp was performed through de novo assembly of next generation sequencing data to obtain information regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological changes in the pericarp, including those leading to fruit surface coloration. a total of  <dig>  gb of raw rna-seq data was generated and this was then de novo assembled into  <dig>  unigenes with a mean length of  <dig> bp. this study provides a large collection of transcripts and expression profiles associated with litchi fruit maturation processes. genes encoding enzymes involved in chlorophyll degradation and flavonoid biosynthesis were identified in the transcriptome dataset. the results demonstrated that stay green  protein might play a key role in chlorophyll degradation in the litchi pericarp. the expression levels of most genes especially late anthocyanin biosynthesis genes were found co-ordinated up-regulated coincident with the accumulation of anthocyanins. the candidate myb transcription factors that likely regulate flavonoid biosynthesis were also identified. their possible roles in anthocyanin biosynthesis were discussed. this study provides a platform for litchi functional genomic research within this species and will benefit researches in other closely related species.
