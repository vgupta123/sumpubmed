BACKGROUND
stem cell-based therapies for the repair and regeneration of various tissues and organs offer a paradigm shift that may lead to alternative therapeutic solutions for a number of diseases. the emerging field of regenerative medicine requires reliable sources of stem cells, biomaterial scaffolds and cytokine growth factors. a stem cell is characterized by its ability to self-renew and to differentiate along multiple lineage pathways. the multi-lineage potentials of embryonic stem cells  and adult stem cells from bone marrow have been extensively documented  <cit> . although escs have been isolated from humans and have enormous potential, their use in therapeutics is restricted by ethical and political issues  <cit> . compared to escs, adult stem cells have diminished self-renewal capability and multipotency. by nature, however, adult stem cells are immunocompatible and there are no ethical issues related to their use. the advantage of using mesenchymal stem cells  over other cell types is the ability to take advantage of their autologous properties  <cit> . mscs can easily be obtained from the patient's own tissue, including bone marrow, adipose tissue, cartilage, synovium, periosteum, muscle, and palatine tonsil and expanded vigorously until the tissues differentiate into specific cell lineages  <cit> .

neural tissue is understood to have a limited capacity for repair after injury, and adult neurogenesis is limited to selected regions of the brain, including the hippocampus, the subventricular zone, and the olfactory system  <cit> . therefore, a broad spectrum of cells capable of neuronal differentiation is required for cell replacement therapies. adult peripheral tissues may be an alternative source of stem and progenitor cells. for example, a number of studies have shown that adult bone marrow contains a population of mesenchymal stem cells capable of differentiating into several lineages, including neuronal and glial tissues  <cit> . however, bone marrow procurement is extremely painful for patients and yields low numbers of harvested cells.

adipose tissue is emerging as a source of stem cells obtained by less invasive methods including lipoaspiration, and in larger quantities than bone marrow. adipose tissue, like bone marrow, is derived from the embryonic mesoderm and contains a heterogeneous stromal cell population that includes mature adipocytes, preadipocytes, fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, monocyte/macrophages, and lymphocytes  <cit> . adipose tissue-derived stem cells  are self-renewing and can differentiate along several mesenchymal tissue lineages, including adipocytes, osteoblasts, myocytes, chondrocytes, endothelial cells, and cardiomyocytes  <cit> . since human adipose tissue is ubiquitous and easily obtained in large quantities under local anesthesia with little patient discomfort, it may present an alternative source of stem cells for mesenchymal tissue regeneration and engineering.

recent studies report that adscs can also be induced into neuron- or glia-like cells in vitro  <cit> , but whether mscs can actually differentiate into neurons and glia remains controversial  <cit> . the neuron-like morphology and immunocytochemical expression for neural markers in transdifferentiated bone marrow-derived mscs under culture or in vivo conditions may be due to cell fusion  <cit> . on the contrary, some investigators have demonstrated that neural differentiation is induced independently of cell fusion  <cit> , indicating either that mscs have an intrinsic ability for differentiation beyond their organ of residence or that msc differentiation potential can be reprogrammed toward specific cell lineages by exogenous cues  <cit> . these results imply that the capacity of adscs for neural differentiation should be evaluated functionally and morphologically.

this study aimed to examine whether neurally-induced hadscs  displayed the functional characteristics of neural cells. we have characterized the multipotent capacity of hadscs isolated from earlobe fat and investigated the differentiation potential of stem cells into neural cells in the presence of bfgf and forskolin, which are known to enhance the neuronal differentiation of bone marrow-derived mscs  <cit>  over two weeks. we identified that ni-hadscs displayed voltage-dependent and ttx-sensitive sodium currents, which are a functional hallmark of neurons, and expressed high levels of ionic channel genes, which are important in neural function.

RESULTS
isolation and characterization of adipose tissue-derived stem cells
human mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from earlobe fat according to their adherence to culture dishes containing dmem supplemented with 10% fbs. the cells were expanded after plating and grown to confluence. approximately four weeks into the culture, cells became more uniform and grew in a monolayer with typical fibroblast-like morphology . the proliferation of human adipose tissue-derived stem cells  remained consistent up until the 15th passage.

to clarify the isolated hadscs, we performed facs analysis with various cell surface markers, including msc-specific cell type markers and hematopoietic stem cell markers . as shown in figure 1b, more than 95% of the adipose tissue-derived hmscs expressed msc-specific markers, including cd <dig>  cd <dig> , cd <dig> , and cd <dig>  but did not express markers for hematopoietic stem cells, including cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  thus, hadscs in this experiment appeared to be mscs.

pluripotent capability of hadscs
to determine whether hadscs are pluripotent and able to differentiate into various cell types in vitro, hadscs were cultured in selection media. human adscs did not spontaneously differentiate during culture expansion. the differentiation of hadscs into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes were also confirmed by specific staining and rt-pcr analysis . after one week of the adipogenic culture medium culture, more than 90% of the cells differentiated into lipid-laden cells that were stained with oil-red o. lipoprotein lipase was markedly expressed in adipogenic cultured cells . after two weeks of the osteogenic medium culture, the cells differentiated into osteoblasts, which were confirmed with strong alkaline phosphatase staining. the rna expression of osteopontin in osteogenic cultured cells was higher than that of the control cells. parathyroid hormone  receptor was also expressed in osteogenic cultured hadscs, indicating differentiation into osteoblasts . differentiation of hadscs into chondrocytes was determined by staining with alcian blue, which identifies the proteoglycan extracellular matrix, a specific component of cartilage tissues. compared to expression in the control cells, the relative rna expression of periecan and collagen type ii in chondrogenic cultured cells increased significantly . these results demonstrate that hadscs have an intrinsic plasticity regarding differentiation into various mesodermal lineage cells.

neural differentiation of hadscs in vitro
for neural induction, hadscs were incubated with growth medium supplemented with bfgf for seven days, and then incubated in dmem with forskolin for the next seven days. in neurally differentiated hadscs, immunoreactivities for neural stem cell markers , neuronal markers , synaptic markers , astrocyte marker , and oligodendrocyte marker  were very high when grown in the presence of bfgf and forskolin supplements . after neural differentiation, the majority of ni-hadscs exhibited distinct bipolar or multipolar morphologies with branched processes, which was well visualized by the immunocytochemistry of the somatodendritic marker, map <dig>  and the axonal marker, gap <dig> . in basal hadscs, the portion of hadscs expressing cell type specific markers was very low. marker-positive cells increased considerably with neural supplements. following terminal differentiation with bfgf and forskolin, a large number of neural marker-positive neurons were observed in cultures when compared with that of gfap-positive astrocytes and cnpase-positive oligodendrocytes .

reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to monitor the extent of neural differentiation in mrna levels of the stem cells. in ni-hadscs, mrna levels encoding for abcg <dig>  a neural stem cell marker, nestin, tuj <dig>  map <dig>  nfl, nfm, nse, gap <dig>  snap <dig>  gfap, and cnpase were higher compared with primary hadscs .

to assess whether ni-hadscs were differentiated into functional neurons, electrophysiological properties were tested in basal hadscs and following neural differentiation using the patch clamp technique in whole-cell configuration. primary hadscs grown in the regular media in the absence of bfgf and forskolin were quiescent, exhibiting virtually no sodium current , which is responsible in both initiation and propagation of neural action potentials throughout the nervous system. however, following differentiation with bfgf and forskolin for two weeks, more than 75% of the ni-hadscs expressed prominent voltage-dependent sodium currents up to  <dig>  na . the mean peak amplitude of voltage-dependent sodium currents at - <dig> mv was - <dig> ±  <dig> pa . sodium currents were blocked by  <dig> nm tetrodotoxin . along with sodium current induction, hadscs grown with differentiation factors demonstrated sustained outward currents, which exhibited voltage-dependence and kinetic characteristics for delayed rectifier potassium currents . under current clamp conditions, the resting membrane potential of neurally differentiated hadsc  was recorded to be significantly more negative than that of control hadscs .

in addition to functional studies, mrna expression for ion channels related to outward and inward currents was investigated in primary- and ni-hadscs with rt-pcr using specific primers . in adscs, ion channel protein or gene expression has not yet been reported. the primary hadscs expressed maxik , kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  , eag <dig> , scn5a , cacna1c , and cacna1g  constitutively. however, primary hadscs did not express kv <dig>  , eag <dig> , or ne-na . following neural differentiation with bfgf and forskolin, the gene expression levels of maxik, kv <dig> , eag <dig>  scn5a, cacna1c, and cacna1g in ni-hadscs were significantly higher than in the primary hadscs . furthermore ni-hadscs expressed kv <dig> , eag <dig>  and ne-na. these results indicate that the hadscs were effectively developed into functional neuron-like cells and thereby expressed neuron-specific phenotypes after being differentiated in vitro.

discussions
our results demonstrate that adscs isolated from human earlobe fat express msc-specific markers and can be differentiated into neural cells via bfgf- and forskolin-dependent pathways. in addition, ni-hadscs have neural markers and functional neuron-like characteristics.

in the present study, the phenotypic expression of hadscs is consistent over culture passages and the morphological features are the same as those previously reported  <cit> . adipose tissue-derived stem cells are understood to express surface markers of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd49d, cd49e, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and stro- <dig>  and lack hematopoietic lineage markers cd11b, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  <cit> . the hadscs expressed msc-specific cell type markers including cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  however, did not express cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig> indicating that hadscs in this study were of mesenchymal origin. adipose tissue-derived stem cells also seem to possess the capacity to differentiate into multiple mesodermal lineages such as bone, fat, and cartilage  <cit> . the current study supports this hypothesis, characterizing the expression of multiple lineage-specific genes and proteins including adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes. this observation has led us to speculate that adipose tissue may be a valuable source of mesodermal stem cells.

reports indicate that the neural differentiation of adscs is achieved with different experimental protocols, protocols include using chemical agents like β-mercaptoethanol <cit> , a mix of valproic acid, butylated hydroxyanisole, insulin, hydrocortisone  <cit> , azacytidine  <cit> , or a cocktail of isobutylmethylxanthine, indomethacin, and insulin  <cit> . a mixture of glial growth factors  <cit> , a mixture including bfgf and platelet-derived growth factor  <cit> , or brain-derived neurotrophic factor  with retinoic acid  <cit>  also evoked the neural induction of adscs in vitro. in addition, rodent adscs are differentiated into schwann cell-like cells by a procedure that involves making floating neurospheres  <cit> . in bone marrow-derived mscs, neural differentiation was induced via transfection of proneural genes  <cit> , treatment with bfgf, forskolin and ciliary neurotrophic factor   <cit>  or co-culture with neural cells  <cit> . in the present study, we used bfgf and forskolin to induce the neural differentiation of hadscs because bfgf is known to generate neural precursor cells with a greater capacity for neuronal differentiation  <cit> . contrary to bfgf, epidermal growth factor and cilliary neurotrophic factor are reported to restrict astrocyte lineages. forskolin is a commonly used agent to increase the intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate  by activating the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. furthermore, forskolin is reported to induce the neuron-like morphology and expression of nse, nfh, and tuj <dig> in human mscs cultured in serum-free conditions  <cit> . our experiments demonstrate that ni-hadscs express increased immunoreactivities for neuronal markers tuj <dig>  map <dig>  nfl, nfm, nfh, nse, neun, gap <dig>  and snap <dig>  as well as the increased mrna expression of tuj <dig>  map <dig>  nfl, nfm, nse, gap <dig>  and snap <dig> compared to primary hadscs , indicating that hadscs differentiate into neural cells via bfgf and forskolin-mediated differentiation. much like neuronal cells derived from other mscs or embryonic stem cells  <cit> , in vitro-transdifferentiated hadscs also exhibited neuronal cell properties.

according to previous reports about neurogenic differentiation, adscs exhibit neuron-like morphology and express several proteins and genes consistent with the neuronal phenotype  <cit> . however, reliance on neural marker expression as an indicator of neurally differentiated mscs has become unreliable because undifferentiated mscs express several neural markers at both the mrna and protein levels  <cit> . adult mesenchymal stem cells constitutively express native immature neural proteins , whereas more mature neuronal and glial proteins  are expressed in increasing passage numbers  <cit> . undifferentiated adscs also express markers characteristic of neural cells such as nse, vimentin, and neun  <cit> . in addition, inter-donor variability of expression of neural marker genes in msc samples needs to be considered  <cit> . we therefore performed electrophysiological studies to investigate whether ni-hadscs demonstrate the functional properties of mature neurons. through patch-clamp recordings, ni-hadscs were identified to generate prominent ttx-sensitive voltage-dependent sodium currents and outward potassium currents, both of which are hallmarks of mature neurons and crucial for signal transmission in the nervous system. in contrast to bone marrow-derived mscs, in which combination of bfgf, forskolin, and cntf was not sufficient to induce voltage-dependent sodium current  <cit> , hadscs expressed the sodium current by treatment of bfgf and forskolin. furthermore, ni-hadscs exhibited about - <dig> mv of resting membrane potential, indicating that they also have functional characteristics of neurons.

recently, anghileri et al. reported electrophysiological evidence of neuronal differentiation  <cit> . after differentiation with bdnf and retinoic acid, hadsc exhibited immunocytochemical evidence of neuronal differentiation in only 57% of cells and mean peak amplitude of approximately - <dig> pa for voltage-dependent na+ currents in differentiated hadscs. ashjian et al. also demonstrated that supplementation with isobutylmethylxnthine , indomethacin and insulin induced transdifferentiation of human processed lipoaspirate cells into neuron-like cells  <cit> . however, they could not observe inward sodium currents. according to our immunocytochemical studies, our results indicate that more than 80% of hadscs appear to differentiate into neuron-like cells under specific in vitro culture conditions with bfgf and forskolin, and express several proteins specific to the neuronal phenotype that exhibit neuronal morphology . furthermore, approximately 75% of hadscs demonstrate neural differentiation properties under electrophysiological study, with about - <dig> pa of voltage-dependent sodium currents being recorded in ni-hadscs. these results suggest that bfgf and forskolin may be more effective than bdnf, retinoic acid, ibmx, indomethacin, and insulin in inducing the neural differentiation of adscs.

although adscs have been used for years in the investigation of cell replacement therapy and differentiation, information about ion channel expression remains undocumented. undifferentiated bone marrow-derived hmscs are known to express the ttx-sensitive sodium channel gene , potassium channel genes  and the calcium channel gene   <cit> . however, this study indicates that primary hadscs also express ion channel mrnas, including potassium channel genes , calcium channel genes , and the ttx-insensitive sodium channel gene , but do not exhibit the ttx-sensitive sodium channel gene  and other voltage-dependent potassium channel genes  . since the primary hadscs did not display voltage-dependent sodium currents prior to neural differentiation, gene expression results are consistent with electrophysiological data. however, neural induction with bfgf and forskolin increased the expression of these ion channel genes, particularly those expressed in the primary hmscs, and induced three novel functional ion channel genes , indicating the differentiation of hadscs towards neuronal cells. this result is an initial finding on the expression of ionic channel genes in both primary- and ni-hadscs.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrates that hadscs have the ability to act as mesenchymal stem cells and can effectively differentiate into functional neuron-like cells with bfgf and forskolin treatment.
