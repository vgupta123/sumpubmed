BACKGROUND
downy mildew of grapes occurs in most parts of the world where grapes are grown, but favors those regions that experience warm, wet conditions during the vegetative growth of the vine. a major outbreak of the disease can cause severe losses in yield and berry quality. symptoms of dm are usually first noticed on leaves as yellowish and later oily lesions on the leaf's upper surface with a 'downy' mass observed on the corresponding underside of the leaf. it can also cause deformation of shoots, tendrils, inflorescences and clusters of young berries. berries become less susceptible as they mature, however rachis infection can spread into the older fruit which leads to direct crop loss by shelling of berries  <cit> .

downy mildew is caused by the pathogen plasmopara viticola . primary infection begins with the overwintering oospore on infected leaves or plant litter in the soil that germinates in the spring and produces a sporangium  <cit> . when plant parts are covered with a film of moisture from rain or irrigation, the sporangium releases small swimming spores  that are then spread by splashing water. the spores can germinate by producing a germ tube that enters the green tissue  through the stomates  <cit> . secondary infection, which is the major source of disease spread, produces spores that may be mobilized by wind and rain to establish new infection sites. the cycle ends with the sexual production of over-wintering oospores  <cit> .

different genotypes of grapes show varying level of resistance to pv, ranging from susceptible v. vinifera, to the moderately resistant v. rupestris and v. amurensis, v. cinerea, v. riparia and v. candicans, to the totally resistant muscadinia rotundifolia  <cit> . the world-wide grape industry relies predominantly on v. vinifera, which requires chemical protection to produce healthy fruits. however, such chemicals may have negative environmental impacts and/or pose risk to human health. a promising alternative strategy that could simultaneously improve grape health and limit chemical use is to identify the unique genes or mechanisms from resistant species that could potentially confer resistance to the pathogen or lower presentation of symptoms. these elements may potentially be introduced into v. vinifera through long-term breeding efforts or transgenic methods. with this perspective, it is important to unravel the molecular basis of natural defense responses in resistant grapevines to dm challenge, including identification of the genetic processes that may contribute to resistance.

responses to pv have been characterized in various resistant species. mechanisms of resistance include induction of chemical barriers, initiation of processes that delay invasive growth of mycelia, or mechanisms that establish hypersensitive response after inoculation of pv  <cit> . genetic and gene expression profiling studies have concluded that rpv <dig>  npr <dig> homologs, and pr protein encoding genes contribute to the function of dm resistance in grapevines  <cit> . others factors, including the amino acid beta-aminobutyric acid  <cit> , and the proteins beta- <dig>  3-glucanase  <cit> , stilbene synthase   <cit> , phenylalanine ammonia lyase   <cit> , thaumatin-like proteins and chitinase  <cit>  may also play an important role in dm resistance. many attempts, including transgenic  <cit>  and traditional breeding approaches  <cit> , have been undertaken to introgress resistance into v. vinifera genotypes.

to understand the mechanism of the host resistance at the molecular level, a critical first step is to identify the transcripts that accumulate in response to the pathogen attack. in this study, "zuoshan-1", a clonal selection from wild v. amurensis with cold hardiness and high resistance to dm  <cit> , was employed to identify a set of candidate genes associated with dm resistance using solexa sequencing technology. solexa sequencing is a technology capable of obtaining novel information for whole-genome-wide transcript expression without prior sequence knowledge. this report presents the finding of these tests.

RESULTS
inoculation and symptom development
the fourth unfolded leaf from the shoot apex of "zuoshan-1" was inoculated with pv. no visible symptoms were observed in the first  <dig> days . the 'downy' mass was obviously observed on the 6th day  and exacerbated on the 8th day . oil spots emerged gradually on the site of pathogen and the spores did not spread to the other healthy tissues  <dig> days after inoculation .

tag identification and quantification
a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> tags were sequenced in infected  and control  libraries, respectively . after filtering out low quality tags ,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> tags  remained in inf and con libraries. to increase the robustness of the approach, single-copy tags in the two libraries  were excluded from further analysis. as a result, a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean tags remained from the two libraries, from which  <dig>   and  <dig>   unique tags were obtained. there were  <dig>  more unique tags in the inf than in the con library, possibly representing genes related to pathogen interaction and symptom development. the percentage of unique tags rapidly declined as copy number increased, indicating only a small portion of the transcripts were expressed at high level in the conditions tested.

depth of sampling
saturation of the library is determined by identification of unique tags. sequencing reaches saturation when no new unique tags are detected. the results shown in figure  <dig> indicate that inf and con libraries were sequenced to saturation, producing a full representation of the transcripts in the conditions tested. in both libraries fewer unique tags were identified as the number of sequencing tags increases, reaching a plateau shortly after  <dig> m tags were sequenced. no new unique tags were identified as the total tag number approached  <dig>  m in inf library and  <dig>  m in con library.

annotation analysis of the unique tag
the unique tags were compared against the genome and gene sequences of v. vinifera cv. pinot noir  <cit>  using blastn. tags with a complete match or one base pair mismatch were considered further. the results in table  <dig> show that a substantial proportion of tags  matched to the "pinot noir" genome, and  <dig>   and  <dig>   in inf and con library matched to  <dig>   and  <dig>   "pinot noir" genes. further analysis revealed that  <dig>  unique tags  in inf library and  <dig>   in con library matched to only one gene sequence in the "pinot noir' genome . these data indicated that approximately 50% of transcripts predicted in grape are expressed in the infected or control leaves, with more transcripts present in the infected sample.

note: *percentage of matched tags/total tags;#percentage of matched genes/total assembled cds of "pinot noir".

tags with no homology to grape were compared with blastn to the vbi microbial database  <cit>  containing genomic sequence information from phytophthora sojae, phytophthora infestans and hyaloperonospora parasitica. there were  <dig> tags identified in inf library found to be identical to those of the oomycete during pv infection .

comparison of gene expression level between the two libraries
differences of tag frequencies that appeared in the inf and con libraries were used for estimating gene expression levels in response to pv infection. the transcripts detected with at least two-fold differences in the two libraries are shown in figure  <dig> . the red dots  and green dots  represent transcripts higher or lower in abundance for more than two fold in inf library, respectively. the blue dots represent transcripts that differed less than two fold between the two libraries, which were arbitrarily designated as "no difference in expression". the degs with five fold or greater differences in accumulation were shown in figure  <dig>  a total of  <dig> genes  increased by at least five fold, and  <dig> genes  were decreased by at least five fold in the inf library, while the expression level of  <dig> % unique tags was within five-fold difference between the two samples.

of degs with differences greater than twenty fold ,  <dig> genes were present at higher levels in the inf library,  <dig> of which were associated with defense , transport , transcription , signal transduction  and metabolism . the highest deg was phosphate-induced protein gene which was present at  <dig> fold of control levels. among these highly expressed genes, many were associated with senescence, abiotic and biotic stresses.

fifteen degs were less abundant in the inf library. those present twenty fold or more in the con library were also listed in table  <dig>  in which  <dig> genes were classified as defense  and metabolism , including genes encoding cytochrome p <dig> and pr proteins. the greatest differences between inf and con degs were -germacrene d synthase and immunoglobulin/major histocompatibility complex that both were present 164-fold lower in the inf library than in the con library.

real-time rt-pcr analysis
in order to validate solexa expression profiles, the steady-state transcript levels of  <dig> "defense related" genes were analyzed. among them, seven genes  were upregulated and five genes  were downregulated . actin, tested to be stable in our previous work, was chosen as a reference gene for data normalization. the trend of rt-pcr based expression profiles among these selected genes was similar to those detected by solexa-sequencing based method. however, the scales of difference between the inf and con were generally smaller in real-time pcr  than in those detected by the solexa-sequencing based method  .

pathway enrichment analysis of degs
the pv affected biological pathways were evaluated by enrichment analysis of degs. significantly enriched metabolic pathways and signal transduction pathways were identified. a total of  <dig> pathways were affected by up- and  <dig> were affected by down-regulated degs, respectively . degs with pathway annotation were listed according to enrichment priority . the first ten enriched pathways were reported in table  <dig>  pathways with q value <  <dig>  are significantly enriched.

ribosomal-associated proteins constituted the only significantly affected pathway for the upregulated degs . other non-significant enriched pathways with large number of upregulated degs included amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, secondary metabolism, plant hormone biosynthesis, and splicesome associated proteins. there were more significantly enriched pathways  for the downregulated degs, which were involved in photosynthesis, as well as metabolism of folate, nicotinate, nicotinamide, fructose, mannose, pyruvate, polyketide sugar unit, and purines, along with alkaloids from histidine and purines.

discussion
in this report solexa sequencing technology, a high-throughput dna sequencing approach, was utilized to estimate gene expression in libraries prepared from infected and control tissues. the results  provided estimates of gene expression as determined by the frequency that any given tag  is sequenced. the data indicate that there is sufficient coverage depth to reach saturation, that is, a complete assessment of all transcripts present in the libraries. theoretically, the rate of novel tag discovery should equal zero if all unique tags of the initial sample had been sequenced. however, this number might be slightly higher because new tags may be added due to the accumulation of sequencing errors as the size of the library increased  <cit> . strict filtering and conservative matching allows recognition of erroneous tags, which are then disregarded. all of these precepts may contribute to a loss of substantial sequence information. however, loss of some data potentially made the results more conservative, revealing only robust and bona fide differences. moreover, the total number of tags after stringent filtering was sufficient for annotation to the reference genes in the grape genome sequence. theoretically, tags should be generated by nlaiii from the 3'-most ends of transcripts, but almost 50% of tags from other nlaiii sites were also generated in our result. since only one tag could be generated in each transcript from any nlaiii site in a cdna, these other nlaiii tags represented a given gene redundantly in the expression profile. this phenomenon accounts for the inflated number of unique tags generated  relative to that of the annotated grape genome . these other tags may also arise because of alternative splicing or incomplete enzyme digestion.

the results represent the first large-scale investigation of the gene expression in dm analysis of grapevine. polesani et al  <cit>  reported  <dig> transcripts identified in pv infected leaves of susceptible cultivar "riesling" using cdna-aflp. figueiredo et al  <cit>  found  <dig> transcripts, representing  <dig> unique gene differentially expressed between two v. vinifera cultivars "regent" and "trincadeira"  by cdna microarray. in the current study,  <dig>  putative genes were identified among the solexa sequencing tags for the inf library and  <dig>  for the con library.

the steady-state transcript level for a set of selected genes was confirmed by real-time rt-pcr. although the differences in gene expression did not match the magnitude of those detected by solexa-based sequencing method, the trends of up- and down- regulation were similar. the lower expression level detected by real-time rt-pcr could be due to the difference of sensitivity between the two technologies. solexa sequencing has been documented to be more sensitive for estimation of gene expression, especially for low-abundance transcripts compared to microarrays and real-time rt-pcr  <cit> . the difference could also be attributed to different inoculation seasons and developmental stages of the grapevines. the materials used for the solexa sequencing method were obtained from materials inoculated and harvested in september, while materials used for the real-time rt- pcr analyses were obtained from plants inoculated and harvested in june.

due to the sensitivity of solexa sequencing technology, many rare transcripts were detected. among  <dig> transcripts present predominantly  in the inf library,  <dig> were not detected in the con library at all. these genes were predicted to be involved in many plant biological processes, including defense. for example, genes encoding cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, lipase-like protein, glutathione synthetase, gdsl-motif lipase, ankyrin repeat family protein, serine hydrolase, proline-rich cell wall protein and multicopper oxidase were previously described as plant defense-related genes. other rare transcripts detected by solexa technology were predicted to function in signal transduction , transport , transcription , and protein metabolism . two novel genes  and some genes encoding hypothetical proteins  were also identified from the pv-induced rare degs. among the  <dig> rare transcripts present more in con than inf,  <dig> were not detected at all in the inf library. most of these transcripts have predicated biological functions in growth regulation , transport , signal transduction , and metabolism .

pathway enrichment analysis revealed the most significantly affected pathways during the pv infection in "zuoshan-1". it is not surprising that the "ribosome-related" pathway was the most affected for the degs more common in inf library. this finding implies that the grapevine utilizes new ribosomes or changes in ribosome components to help synthesize additional proteins, such as pr proteins, to protect itself from the pathogen attack. the second affected pathway was the "amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism" pathway. in this pathway genes encoding chitinase were more prevalent in the inf than the con library. in addition, genes required for cell wall biosynthesis were also affected, such as d-xylan synthase, udp-glucose dehydrogenase, and udp-glucose  <dig> -dehydratase. these enzymes are involved in the interconversion of nucleotide sugars, and may regulate glycosylation patterns in response to pathogen, thereby linking signaling with primary metabolism and the dynamics of the extracellular matrix. the other noticeable pathways with a large amount of degs associated with pv infection were starch and sucrose metabolism, secondary metabolism, plant hormone biosynthesis, and splicesome-associated proteins. for degs less prevalent in infected vs. control libraries, there was significant enrichment for transcripts associated with photosynthesis. this result was similar to the reports of polesani et al  <cit> . photosystem i proteins , photosystem ii proteins , cytochorme b6/f complex  and f-type atpase  were all substantially lower in abundance in inf libraries compared to con libraries. the reduction of photosynthesis was possibly due to the increase of invertase activity in nucleotide sugar metabolism pathway. invertase would cleave sucrose into hexose sugars and their accumulation inhibits the calvin cycle.

it was observed that  <dig> tags identified in inf library were homologous to the oomycete, indicating that they may belong to pv transcripts, predictably noting the presence of the pathogen. many of these putative pv transcripts corresponded to genes involved in protein metabolism  as a requirement for protein synthesis in the pathogen during the plant-pathogen interaction. many housekeeping genes  and genes related to immune response  were also detected. several pv transcripts showed similarity to enzymes involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism , energy production , and cellular transport .

transcripts more abundant in infected leaves
a set of transcripts were clearly more abundant in tissue arising after pv infection compared to control. this group possibly contains elements that confer resistance to the spread of the pathogen in "zuoshan-1". among these transcripts, those expressed at a relatively high level in infected tissue are of the most interest. these transcripts likely encode genes responding to the pathogen or genuine factors that underlie genetic resistance, which were broadly grouped into the following categories based on their known roles in other plant systems.

defense response genes
among defense response genes, thaumatin-like protein  <cit> , polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein   <cit> , harpin-induced protein-related  <cit> , glutaredoxin  <cit>  and beta-glucosidase  <cit>  have been widely studied in plant pathogen resistance. thaumatin-like protein, like many other disease resistant proteins  <cit> , is also induced by abiotic stresses, which may indicate existence of a crosstalk between pathogen and abiotic stresses. in this category, tobacco mosaic virus  response -related protein  is associated with tmv attack and may also play an important role in dm resistance of grape.

transport
three transcripts were associated with transport function. multidrug resistance pump proteins  and multidrug resistance abc transporter  are well known transporters in clinical study for bacteria infection of human  <cit> . such transporters also have been isolated from plants, such as coptis japonica  <cit> . they transport several compounds associated with multidrug  resistance which can inhibit pathogen infection in animal model  <cit> . another gene identified to be transport related is mitochondrial dicarboxylate carrier protein  which might be involved in the excretion of organic acids and rhizotoxic aluminum tolerance  <cit> .

signal transduction
there were fourteen transcripts in our results associated with signal transduction. two came from genes  encoding leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinases which were more prevalent  in the inf library than in control. molecules that indicate the presence of pathogen  activate host receptors and that rapidly generate an internal signal that triggers early defense responses  <cit> . various signals presented in our results, including phytohormones like aba and ethylene, as well as intracellular messengers like calcium, phosphoinositide and kinases, have been proposed to regulate plant responses in adverse environmental conditions and thus contribute to the coordination of plant stress physiology  <cit> . transcripts representing three kinase-encoding genes  were present 52- <dig> fold higher in inf than con, and have been widely documented as signaling factors in many stresses  <cit>  and senescence  <cit> . four transcripts  were found to be more abundant  in inf than con, and were associated with calcium signaling pathway. all of these are also induced by senescence  <cit>  and many stresses  <cit> . nodulin-like protein  induced in fungal pathogen treatment  <cit>  and drought/heat combination stress  <cit>  has been shown to be involved in salicylic acid  signaling pathway  <cit> . a ring-h <dig> gene  has demonstrated regulatory function in aba signaling  <cit> , drought tolerance  <cit> , regulation of growth and defense responses against abiotic/biotic stresses  <cit> . ethylene-regulated transcript  <dig>   is involved in ethylene response 'circuit' including ethylene synthesis, perception, signal transduction and regulation of gene expression  <cit> . the par-1a  protein  is a serine/threonine kinase with diverse phosphorylation targets and has been reported to be induced by infection with potato virus y  <cit> .

transcription
eleven transcripts associated with transcription were  <dig> to  <dig> fold more abundant in inf than con libraries. transcripts annotated as zinc-finger protein  <dig>  dreb protein, ap <dig> domain class transcription factor, basic helix-loop-helix protein, cbf <dig>  jasmonate zim domain  <dig>  gras family transcription factor, and wrky transcription factor  <dig> were all present at higher steady state levels in infected tissue. they have been documented to play important roles in responding to phytohormone stasis, pathogen attack and environmental stresses  <cit> .

metabolism
synthesis of the hormones
s-adenosyl-l-methionine  and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase  <dig>  are transcripts related to synthesis of plant hormones, and were found more frequently  in the inf library. s-adenosyl-l-methionine is the precursor of ethylene  <cit>  which participates in regulation of growth, development, and responses to stress and pathogen attack in plants  <cit> . nced is an important enzyme in synthesizing the phytohormone aba which plays a central role in responses to pathogen attack  <cit> .

protein metabolism
twelve transcripts related to protein metabolism were more abundant in the inf library,  <dig> fold to  <dig> fold. among them, ubiquitin-protein ligase , spotted leaf protein  and f-box family protein  were identified, and represent proteins involved in ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. aspartic proteinase nepenthesin- <dig> precursor  is expressed at higher level in "nipponbare" in response to phosphorus deficiency  <cit>  and isolated from salt-stress wild rice "porteresia coarctata"  <cit> . protein phosphatase 2c  regulates numerous aba responses  <cit> . nucleic acid binding proteins  control genes expression in response to oxidative stress  <cit> , aba treatment  <cit>  and abiotic stresses  <cit> . exocyst subunit exo <dig> family protein h <dig>  has been shown to be involved in the exocytic pathway, which sorts newly synthesized proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to their final destination at the lysosome, vacuole or plasma membrane  <cit> .

secondary metabolism
this subcategory contained  <dig> genes, including a higher level of tropinone reductase  transcript in infected leaves, consistent with previous reports showing it to be more abundant after pathogen infection  <cit> . isoflavone reductase-like protein  <dig>  also has a potential pathogen resistance role because it is involved in biosynthesis of isoflavonoid phytoalexins  <cit> , an important product in resistance to pathogen infection  <cit> . udp-glucose glucosyltransferase  and galactinol synthase  are reported to be induced by abiotic stresses  <cit> .

cell wall organization
three genes were classified into this subcategory. cellulose synthase-like d <dig>  and beta-expansin 1a precursor  contribute to cell wall synthesis and modification  <cit> . the wound-induced protein   with anti-fungal activity  <cit>  possesses a domain that binds pamp  elicitors   <cit>  and is induced in response to pathogen. in addition, other highly expressed metabolic genes in the inf samples were glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase , cytochrome p <dig>  and serine acetyltransferase . these transcripts are related to carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis and cysteine synthesis. cysteine synthesis has reported to respond to oxidative stress by calcium signaling  <cit> .

even though most of these genes have been reported to be biotic or abiotic stresses related, seven high expressed genes in the infected leaves have not been previously reported being associated with stress. they were noted as protein-binding protein , atpp2-a <dig>  , putative integral membrane protein , putative phosphate-induced protein , atp-dependent dna helicase , cw <dig> , and a hypothetical protein .

transcripts less abundant in infected leaves
the most striking functions for transcripts less abundant in infected tissue were those associated with metabolism and defense response to pathogen attack. fifteen degs were detected to be less prevalent in the inf libraries more than  <dig> fold compared to con, most of which, such as -germacrene d synthase  <cit> , non-specific lipid transfer protein  <cit> , major histocompatibility complex  <cit> , thioredoxin  <cit> , beta-cyano-alanine synthase  <cit> , expansin  <cit>  and udp-glucosyltransferase  <cit>  are reported to be positively associated with plant defense responses to pathogen attack. however, our data indicated that the expression level of these transcripts was lower in infected tissues.

another two transcripts that were less prevalent in infected tissue  belong to cytochrome p <dig> family with oxidative function. interestingly, a novel gene encoding male sterility-related protein was also identified in this group, and its function associated with dm response has not been clarified.

CONCLUSIONS
solexa-based sequencing can be used for analyzing variation in gene expression between two samples. the gene expression level in "zuoshan-1" leaves infected with pv changed significantly in comparison with control leaves. analysis of differentially-expressed genes involved in the pathogen infection allows delineation of candidate genes potentially relevant to dm resistance in grapevines.
