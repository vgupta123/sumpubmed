BACKGROUND
many mammalian species have long served our human society by providing food, materials, and labor, providing companionship as pets, and serving as model organisms for biological studies. besides the seven mammals  whose genomic sequence data are already available,  <dig> eutherian mammals have been proposed for low-coverage genome sequencing efforts  <cit> . comparative genomics has been proven to be a powerful strategy to identify important evolutionary changes among these mammalian species  <cit> . evolutionary changes, which have shaped the mammalian genomes, include both small-scale  as well as large-scale events . knowledge of mutation rates is critical for building evolutionary timescale, discovering conserved noncoding functional elements, identifying evolutionary processes like positive selection, and understanding heritable diseases  <cit> .

earlier studies on mammalian evolution were limited by the lack of large-scale genomic sequence data and were dependent upon pcr cross-amplification of limited numbers of mitochondrial and nuclear genes. therefore, these sampled sequences were often limited to closely related species and had a bias towards conserved unique regions. this also resulted in repetitive sequences being excluded from genomic divergence calculations in these earlier studies. as the remnants of transposition events, repetitive sequences are one of the most predominant features of mammalian genomes   <cit> . repeats have been shown to play an important role in mammalian genome evolution  <cit> . depending on their time of origin, repeats can be divided into ancestral repeats  and lineage-specific repeats . recently it has been shown that virtually all ancient repeats evolve neutrally  <cit> . as one class of nonfunctional neutral sequences, ancient repeats have been used to estimate neutral mutation rates  <cit> . several recent studies have indicated that neutral mutation rates  in mammals have been relatively constant  <cit> , except for the discrepant results from rodents, which were shown to mutate as much as 2-fold faster than other mammals  <cit> .

with the availability of the human, mouse, rat and chimpanzee genome assemblies, whole genome-wide comparisons and analyses have been generated using primates and rodents   <cit> . targeted comparative sequencing efforts  also have generated megabases of high-quality genomic sequence for dozens of mammalian species  <cit> . recent studies also have measured mutation rates  <cit> , their regional variation  <cit>  and their covariation with other genomic events in human, mouse and rat <cit> . a local alignment algorithm, blastz  <cit> , has been used to align human, mouse and rat genomes  <cit> . on the other hand, a global alignment algorithm, mlagan, has been used to generate multiple alignments in the "greater cftr region"  <cit> . a comparison of results derived from local versus global alignment algorithms would be of interest.

with the dog draft assembly  <cit> , the cattle draft assembly  <cit>  and cattle bac library resources  <cit>  now available, a large-scale genomic comparison was initiated to assess the nature and pattern of genomic variation among other mammalian orders; i.e. artiodactyls  and carnivores  as compared to primates . to avoid any potential genome assembly artifacts, the project began with high-quality finished genomic sequences from cattle bac clones, rather than the cattle draft assembly. the three-way multi-species global alignments  were generated from the orthologous sequences of cattle, dog and human using an optimized global alignment algorithm to provide a platform for analyzing genomic variation. the lineage, which led to the last common ancestor  of cattle and dog, was estimated to have diverged from human approximately  <dig> million years ago  followed by the estimated separation of cattle and dog  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the overall objective of this study was to assess patterns of single-nucleotide mutations across genomic regions and among different sequence classes in the mammalian lineages.

RESULTS
orthologous sequences and alignment validation
a total of  <dig> ortholog trios were identified though a sequence similarity search, which included  <dig>  mb of cattle sequences,  <dig>  mb of dog sequences and  <dig>  mb of human sequences. the putative ortholog trios were further confirmed by reciprocal blast  <cit> . these ortholog trios were placed to all human chromosomes  except for chr  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and y .

two strategies were implemented to align these orthologous sequences using the global alignment algorithm – mlagan: 1) optimizing the alignment parameters and 2) applying a post-alignment filter. in order to establish the optimal parameters to treat indels in global alignment,  <dig> random sets of pairwise sequence alignments were analyzed between cattle-dog, cattle-human and dog-human. using the software lagan  <cit> , a series of gap opening and extension penalties were tested for their impact on the frequency of single nucleotide and insertion/deletion events . the following tests were performed to select the optimal alignment parameters that minimized sequence divergence and the number of indels. first, the natures of the sequences underlying insertion/deletions were analyzed. alignment parameters  were favored because insertion/deletions were effectively treated as a single event. second, the overall estimates of sequence divergence  were compared with earlier phylogenetic studies using conserved coding regions  <cit>  or the greater cftr region aligned by blastz  <cit> . the estimated overall sequence divergences in our analyses  were generally comparable to previous studies  <cit> . third,  <dig>  randomly selected cattle bac end sequences  from chori- <dig>  <cit>  were mapped onto the human genome assembly build <dig>  <cit> . similar results were observed when alignments of bac end sequences were compared with our optimal global alignments. the variation distribution pattern of these bes alignments   was remarkably similar to the distribution observed for non-overlapping 500-bp windows generated from optimal global alignments .

despite the optimization of alignment parameters, suboptimal or ectopic alignments occasionally occurred. suboptimal alignments were defined as those alignments that exceeded  <dig> standard deviations of the mean pairwise k <dig> divergences in a sliding window analysis , which were removed using a post-alignment filter. although such suboptimal alignments composed less than 5% of aligned bases, these alignments were not considered in our analysis to avoid overestimation of genomic divergence.

a total of  <dig> three-way multiple sequence alignments were generated with a combined alignment length of  <dig> mb, consisting of  <dig>  mb of aligned bases and  <dig>  non-overlapping windows of  <dig> kb . the cattle-dog-human multiple alignment lengths ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp with a mean and standard deviation of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  bp. all individual alignments and patterns of single-nucleotide variation were manually inspected and are available online  <cit> .

branch lengths in various sequence classes
comparative genomic analyses were performed on these  <dig> three-way multi-species global alignments. the branch lengths and substitution rates of cattle, dog and human are shown in table  <dig>  the average overall branch lengths were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  change/site for cattle, dog and human, respectively. similar degrees of branch lengths were reported in previous studies  <cit> . the genomic divergence between cattle and dog was the smallest with a value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  change/site. the dog-human evolutionary divergence was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  change/site, which was less than the cattle-human divergence of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  change/site. as expected, these results confirm that artiodactyls and carnivores are the closest relatives, with primates being the most distant. mutations at cpg dinucleotides occur frequently due to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines  <cit> . to remove any variation caused by differences in levels of methylation, substitution rates were estimated after removing cpg dinucleotides . the overall branch lengths decreased  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  after removing cpg dinucleotides from all sequences within alignments . alignments were further sorted into four sequence classes based on ncbi refseq  <cit>  and repeatmasker coordinates using the software mam  <cit> . the total  <dig>  mb aligned sequences included  <dig> kb,  <dig> kb,  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb aligned bases from coding, utr, unique noncoding , and repetitive regions, respectively. coding regions of  <dig> well-annotated refseq genes excluded both 3' and 5' utr. branch lengths in coding regions  were only half of the overall branch length, reflecting that they are under strong purifying selection. the branch lengths in utr regions  were significantly larger than the coding branch lengths . the branch lengths in unique noncoding portions  were slightly less than the overall branch lengths. in contrast, the aligned repetitive portions possessed the longest branch lengths . these branch lengths decreased  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  when cpg dinucleotide sites were excluded, suggesting higher substitution rates of cpg sites . the differences were significant between the branch lengths in unique noncoding vs. repetitive portions before and after removing cpg dinucleotides from repetitive elements  for all  <dig> autosomal alignments.

regional variation of substitution rates
substitution rates were calculated from the lca of cattle and dog assuming branch times of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> million years for cattle, dog and human lineages, respectively  <cit> . a dramatic variation of substitution rates was observed between and within chromosomes according to the human placement. table s <dig>  summarizes the substitution rates of ar for each individual clone or locus on each chromosome. chromosome x accumulated fewer substitutions than autosomal chromosomes , supporting the existence of a higher mutation rate in the male than in the female germline  <cit> . among autosomal chromosomes, hsa <dig> , showed higher substitution rates  compared to rates in chromosome  <dig> . substitution rates for hsa <dig> and hsa <dig> were significantly higher, while those for hsa <dig>  hsa <dig> and hsa <dig> were significantly lower when compared to the average substitution rates in repetitive regions .

similarly, substitution rates varied significantly among individual clones or loci within one chromosome . for example, contig  <dig>   showed high substitution rates , while contig  <dig>   demonstrated low substitution rates , even though both belonged to the same chromosomes .

histograms of substitution rates in non-overlapping 3-kb sliding windows for overall  and repetitive  sequences  are shown in fig.  <dig>  anova tests were performed on variation in branch lengths of 3-kb nonoverlapping windows between and within autosomal chromosomes for each species. these included  <dig> types of sequences: overall, overall-cg, unique noncoding, unique noncoding-cg, repetitive, and repetitive-cg. the overall sequence comprised  <dig> autosomal alignments containing  <dig> windows; the unique noncoding regions comprised  <dig> autosomal alignments containing  <dig> windows; and the repetitive regions comprised  <dig> autosomal alignments containing  <dig> windows. all tests were statistically significant at p < <dig> .

the relationships of overall substitution rate, branch length, k <dig> divergence, indel rate per  <dig> kb, sine% and line% on gc% were complex and were best fit by a quadratic function  <cit>  . it is worth noting that branch lengths  were well correlated among species – almost as well as the gc% distribution , although branch lengths and substitution rates did not seem to correlate with gc% . a positive coefficient for gc% but a negative coefficient for the square of gc% was obtained in all quadratic fit functions. the k <dig> divergences tended to increase over the gc% interval below 45%, whereas the plots tended to decrease above a gc% of 45%. however, all substitution rate and branch length fitting curves were relatively flat. this is consistent with an earlier observation of the discrepancy of rate estimation by the simple parametric model vs. the complicated rate model and maximum likelihood method at the high gc% isochores  <cit> . the quadratic fits for substitution rate on gc% had r <dig> values of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % for cattle, dog, and human, respectively. the quadratic fits for k <dig> divergence on gc% had r <dig> values of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % for cattle-dog, cattle-human and dog-human comparisons, respectively. correspondingly, the quadratic fits for indel on gc% had r <dig> values of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the dramatic differences between sine and line distribution relative to gc% agreed with the previous observations of their differential insertion bias and retention behaviors  <cit> .

loci with lower overall divergences were inspected for the presence of underlying refseq genes. as expected, many protein coding genes were under functional constraints. these constraints such as those on the foxp <dig>  met and scap <dig> genes within the great cftr region may explain the low overall divergences observed within that part of hsa <dig>  <cit> . when loci with high overall divergences were examined, it is interesting to note that a few protein coding genes were also detected. these included csmd <dig>  <cit>  , fdft <dig>  <cit>  and ctsb   <cit> . these loci retained higher substitution rates even if only the ar regions were considered .

the differences of substitution rates between cattle and dog
the overall substitution rates were estimated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  × 10- <dig> change/site/year for cattle, dog and human, respectively . indeed, estimates of neutral mutation rates using ancient repeats  were comparable to previous studies   <cit> , agreeing almost perfectly with the estimates from the human-mouse comparisons   <cit> . in all cases in fig.  <dig> , the distributions of dog substitution rates  were shifted slightly to the left of those of cattle rates , consistent with the faster rate of substitution in the cattle branch compared with the dog branch.

relative rate tests were performed on a single merged alignment and on each of the  <dig> multiple alignments using tajima's method  <cit> . differences in mutation counts were assessed using the χ <dig> test based on the assumption that mutation would not show a species preference. when using human as an outgroup, cattle had faster rates of substitution as compared to dog. although the difference was relatively small , it was significant by the χ <dig> test  when the merged alignment was tested. almost two-thirds  of the individual alignment rate tests supported that cattle had faster rates, while  <dig> of these rate tests supported that dog had faster rates . the remaining  <dig> out of  <dig> tests supported the molecular clock hypothesis for the cattle and dog lineages .

discussion
one of the fundamental challenges in large-scale comparative genomic analysis is to build biologically meaningful multiple sequence alignments  <cit> . a variety of biological events are known to create insertion/deletions including lineage-specific amplification of tandem repeats, homology-mediated genomic deletions and transposition events  <cit> . local alignment algorithms, combined with the removal and reinsertion strategy of repeat elements, have been shown to reduce the number of gaps in dna alignments and increase sensitivity  <cit> . this is particularly important for aligning the species like rodents which have high genome-wide substitution rates. however, the aligned ancient repeats may be enriched for those in more slowly changing regions, while the fast changing repeats may be too divergent for detection and alignment  <cit> . on the other hand, global alignment algorithms seem appropriate for species with low substitution rates like cattle, dog and human. comparative gene mapping and chromosome painting studies have indicated that a remarkably slow rate of chromosomal change exists within several mammalian orders. artiodactyls and carnivores are more conserved relative to humans than rodents  <cit> . in terms of genomic divergence, previous data  <cit>  also suggests that cattle and dog are more conserved relative to human. but global alignment algorithms assume colinearity between sequences and do not specifically handle synteny breaking events like transpositions, rearrangements  or duplications  <cit> . for example, global alignment algorithms may be ineffective to treat lineage-specific repeats which are closely matched such as young sines and lines, creating suboptimal alignments  <cit> . these suboptimal alignments may lead to less accurate estimates of sequence divergence. therefore, in this study, alignment parameters were optimized and a post-alignment filter was applied to overcome the above limitation of the global alignment algorithm. the post-alignment filter effectively removed the suboptimal alignments from the mlagan output. such suboptimal alignments appeared abnormal because they had extreme fluctuations in genomic divergences compared to their flanking sequences and were always associated with multiple gaps. similar genomic divergence results obtained in the current study compared to earlier reports  <cit> , confirm that our sequence datasets were representative and our alignment strategies were successful.

our orthologous sequence datasets, comprised of  <dig>  mb of cattle sequences,  <dig>  mb of dog sequences and  <dig>  mb of human sequences, were placed on all human chromosomes except for chr  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and y . as a control for sample bias and rate variation among these genomic regions, we mapped randomly selected cattle bac end sequences onto the human genome assembly build <dig> . a comparison of these bes alignments to our large-scale genomic alignments showed comparable results . therefore, it is reasonable to believe that these datasets are sufficiently representative and robust to draw sound conclusions regarding rates and properties of mammalian genomic mutation.

however, our estimates were consistently larger than those in an earlier study of the greater cftr region  <cit>  and revealed significant rate differences between the cattle and dog lineages. reanalysis of the alignments in that study  indicated that the dog-human divergence  was significantly higher than the cattle-human divergence  . comparable divergences were derived from our ar regions  from the same region . in our study, no significant rate difference was detected between cattle and dog . one possible explanation is that the global alignment algorithm mlagan was used to create multiple alignments in the current study while pair-wise alignments were constructed by the local alignment algorithm – blastz in the earlier study. as discussed above, local alignment algorithms are known to be less efficient in identifying fast changing ancient repeats, which may be too divergent to detect and align. this could lead to the underestimation of the genomic divergences. on the other hand, use of a global alignment algorithm can recover the fast changing orthologous ancient repeats by taking into consideration the conservation of nearby unique flanking sequences. discrepancies in the significance of rate variation between the small and large datasets also further highlight the importance of a large-scale sampling strategy.

as expected, different sequence classes were under different purifying selection pressures. coding regions were under the strongest functional constraints with substitution rates at only half that of the overall substitution rates. it is interesting to note that substitution rates in unique noncoding portions were slightly less than overall substitution rates suggesting they may be under weak negative selection due to unidentified functional regions, regulatory domains, or unknown genes. significantly higher substitution rates in repetitive elements before or after removing cpg dinucleotides indicate that cpg content is only partially the reason for high substitution rates. in addition, other factors like increased rates of gene conversion, relaxed purifying selection and unequal crossover among repeats may contribute to our observations.

the quadratic relationships between substitution rate, branch length, k <dig> divergence, indel rate per  <dig> kb and gc% were derived to explain regional variation. these results suggest that fluctuations in gc% predict an appreciable amount of the regional variation that was observed in mutation and indel rates, but leave the majority of the variation unexplained. additional causes beyond gc%, including cpg content, recombination and other as of yet unknown factors are needed to explain the variation among mutation rates. significant variation in mutation rates across genomic regions and among sequence classes strongly demonstrates that future studies of genomic variation should include multiple regions from different chromosomes. another important observation is that regional variation in mutation rate is correlated among cattle, dog and human lineages over time. regional correlations of mutation rates have been demonstrated and quantified genome-wide in human-chimpanzee, human-mouse and human-rat comparisons  <cit> .

it is also interesting to note that a handful of protein coding genes were detected within a few cattle bac clones with high neutral mutation rates. several possible nonexclusive explanations for this phenomenon exist. for instance, the sequences compared may not have been orthologous. within one gene family, paralogous genes could be confused with orthologous genes. gene conversion may have occurred, which could considerably increase the genomic divergence  <cit> . in addition, high mutation rates or relaxed purifying selection could have occurred due to gene duplication  <cit> . these possibilities warrant further investigation. however, these rare events would not likely significantly change our estimates of mutation rates.

measurement of the neutral mutation rate is crucial for validating molecular clock and neutral evolution theories  <cit> . the neutral mutation rate has been approximately estimated from neutral or close to neutral non-functional sites such as introns, pseudo-genes, unique noncoding intergenic regions, four-fold degenerate sites  in coding regions  and shared ancestral repeats. one way to identify regions under positive selection is to focus on dna segments with significantly higher mutation rates  <cit> . genomic regions that are changing significantly slower than the neutral rate because of purifying selection contain potentially conserved noncoding functional elements  <cit> .

estimates of the neutral mutation rates in this study, which are in agreement with many previous reports  <cit> , show that mutation rates in the cattle and dog lineages are slower as compared with those in rodents. however, our estimates around  <dig> – <dig>  × 10- <dig> change/site/year are in the lower end of the reported range   <cit> . these differences could result from the usage of 4d sites in the earlier studies, as nucleotides in coding regions may not be an ideal dataset because of codon usage bias and potential weak selection  <cit> . regions that harbored large, low copy repeat sequences were excluded in this study to unambiguously determine the orthologous relationship. such segmental duplicated regions may significantly inflate estimates of divergence due to non-orthologous sequence relationships  <cit>  or gene conversion  <cit> .

the dataset presented here, though much large than those used previously  <cit> , is still a small part  of the cattle, dog and human genomes. it is also worth noting that a number of the common assumptions made about neutral mutation, genetic drift, generation-time and population size, can affect these estimates  <cit> , and rate calculations could be confounded by incorrect estimates of species divergence times. more comprehensive genome sequences and polymorphism data will be required to further clarify the important role of mutation rates in mammalian evolution. further study of the molecular mechanisms behind mutation will be essential to understand the causes of mutation rate variation. additional analyses will become feasible as the bovine genome approaches the finishing stage.

additional note
after the completion of this study, a comprehensive comparative analysis of the domestic dog genome reported similar genomic divergence estimates between dog and human  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the unique features of this study include 1) optimal multiple  alignments were carefully constructed using a global  alignment algorithm; 2) the scale was considerably larger as compared to earlier reports using small datasets of protein coding sequences or targeted genomic regions and 3) our results were statistically significant and unbiased as supported by the mapping results of genome-wide randomly selected cattle bac end sequences.

therefore, this analysis provides a large-scale and unbiased assessment of genome divergences and regional variations of substitution rates among cattle, dog and human. cattle had faster average rates of substitution as compared to dog and the difference was 6%. the global molecular clock needs to be adjusted to fit rates among mammalian species. these data will serve as a valuable baseline for future molecular evolution studies, especially in cattle and other livestock like sheep and pig.
