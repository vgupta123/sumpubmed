BACKGROUND
variations in dna copy number occur in many diseases such as down, prader-willi, turner and angelman syndromes, as well as in cancer. in particular, a loss or gain of dna copy number is frequently observed in cancer, affecting  tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. techniques that detect abnormalities in dna copy number are therefore useful for studying the associations between dna aberrations and disease phenotype and for locating critical genes.

comparative genomic hybridization  was developed for genome-wide analysis of dna copy number and is based on two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization   <cit> . in cgh, differentially-labeled total genomic dnas from a 'test' and a 'reference' cell population are co-hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes, using blocking dna to suppress signals from repetitive sequences. the resulting fluorescence intensity ratio at a location on the 'cytogenetic map' of the chromosomes is approximately proportional to the ratio of copy numbers between the corresponding dna sequences in the test and reference genomes. however, the use of metaphase chromosomes limits the detection of events involving small regions  of the genome, i.e. the resolution of closely spaced aberrations, making it difficult to assign their genomic locus. moreover, cgh results must be adjusted for biases in the correlation of the heteroscedastic data distribution in a two-color fish  <cit> , although use of the "dye swap" method substantially reduces this problem.

recently, a dna microarray-based cgh was developed  <cit> . in addition, oligonucleotide arrays for detecting snp have been used to analyze genomic copy numbers  <cit> . these microarray-based methods have higher resolution than fish-based cgh, and the recent availability of commercial products has increased the popularity of this technique. however, because currently available arrays have gaps between probes, some regions are not available for analysis. it is important to have a technique for making detailed measurements of dna copy number in regions of interest.

in this report, we describe a new technique for measuring changes in gene copy number to meet these needs. polymerase chain reaction  is an alternative technique for quantifying genome copy number. although several reports have used pcr to measure dna copy numbers  <cit> , it has not gained broad popularity because careful calibration is required for accurate quantification. in the new pcr-based technique described here, competitive genomic pcr , competitive pcr is performed using restricted genomic dna ligated to specific adaptors as a template. different adaptors are added to the test and control samples and the test-to-reference ratio is determined by quantifying the amplified products fractionated by gel electrophoresis. cgp does not require preliminary calibration experiments, considerably improving the throughput and rapidity of the experimental process. this technique complements hybridization-based techniques for cgh and can easily serve as an alternative to fish or array-based cgh, especially for high-resolution analysis of a particular chromosome region.

RESULTS
outline of the cgp assay
the cgp assay comprises several enzymatic steps to produce a pcr template containing genomic dna ligated to specific adaptors. a scheme of the method is presented in fig.  <dig>  first, double-strand genomic dna was digested with the restriction endonuclease pstl, which cleaves at ctgcag. the first 5'-biotinylated adaptor  was then ligated to dna sample a, the adaptor  to sample b and the third  to sample c . the three adaptors shared a common sequence and had a cohesive end complementary to the psti restriction site; however, the second adaptor was  <dig> bases longer than the first and the third was  <dig> bases longer than the second . after ligation, we mixed the three dna samples; the first and the third adaptors were both ligated with fmix dna as a reference , but in different quantities , while the second was used for the test sample . the samples were digested with the restriction endonuclease mboi, which recognizes the  <dig> bp cleavage site gatc. adaptor-supplemented genomic dna fragments were recovered using streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads and were pcr-amplified using an adaptor-specific and a locus-specific primer complementary to a sequence near the psti recognition site. mboi digestion and subsequent purification by the beads removes most of genomic dna, which may result in artifactual amplification. for detection, the adaptor-primer was labeled with a fluorescent dye. the amplified fragments were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified with an automated sequencer.

using this procedure, we tested the cgp assay using fmix and mmix dnas  as references for  <dig> loci on chromosome x and  <dig> loci on chromosome  <dig>  when we used fmix dna for both the test and reference samples, the test/reference fluorescence ratios measured for loci on chromosome x were tightly distributed around a log <dig> value of  <dig> . in contrast, when we compared genomic dna from mmix  with fmix , the distribution of fluorescence ratios for chromosome x loci was shifted and approached a mean log <dig> value of - <dig>  while the ratios for loci on chromosome  <dig> remained at a log <dig> value of  <dig>  these differences reflect the absence of the single-copy chromosome x from the control male samples . the standard deviation of the log <dig> values was  <dig>  excluding outliers, and  <dig>  including outliers.

design of locus-specific primers for the cgp assay
in the cgp assay, it is important that each primer binds to a single locus in the genome. in addition, because cgp is used to study genetic changes in cancer, the loci used for quantification should be located near genes that are commonly expressed in cancer tissues. to fulfill these requirements we adopted the following strategy.

we previously performed gene expression profiling on more than a thousand cancer tissues by adaptor-tagged competitive pcr   <cit>  for the cancer gene expression database   <cit> . for each cancer type we performed middle-scale est sequencing , and selected genes for assay among the expressed genes. it should be noted that our ests correspond to an mrna region with an mboi site closest to the 3' end. the number of ests sequenced to date is  <dig> . we used this est collection to construct the cgp primer library.

the procedure for designing the locus-specific primers is presented schematically in fig.  <dig>  first, all the ests in the collections were compared with the human genome by a blast search of the ncbi database  <cit> . when an est matched a single chromosomal locus, we isolated it together with the surrounding  <dig> kbp of genomic dna. second, we searched for psti restriction sites in the region surrounding the mboi site of the est. we designed primers that were 15– <dig> bases downstream or upstream from the psti site and had a melting temperature between  <dig> and 64°c. using the dbsnp database  <cit> , we eliminated primer sequences or psti sites containing snps and primers in which a mboi restriction site was present between the psti site and the locus-specific primer sequence. finally, the primers were screened using a blast search in ensembl  <cit> ; we selected only those that matched a single chromosomal locus. the primer sequences for the whole genome are supplied as the additional data file  <dig> 

detection of changes in low-level dna copy number
to test the sensitivity of cgp in detecting changes in single copy numbers, we used genomic dna from cell lines with varying numbers of x chromosomes  and compared  <dig> loci of chromosome x with  <dig> loci of chromosome  <dig> 

when we compared two fmix samples used as both test and reference dna, the test/reference fluorescence ratios measured for chromosome x loci were tightly distributed around a mean value of  <dig> . in contrast, when we compared genomic dna from mmix  with fmix , the distribution of fluorescence ratios for chromosome x loci was shifted to a mean value of  <dig>  . similarly, when we compared genomic dnas from  <dig>  xxx  <dig>  xxxx and  <dig>  xxxxx cell lines using fmix dna, the distribution of fluorescence ratios for chromosome x loci was shifted to mean log <dig> values of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively , reflecting the increase in chromosome x dna copy-number. the mean fluorescence ratios for chromosome x loci obtained in the different experiments displayed a tight linear fit , with a correlation coefficient of  <dig> . this demonstrates that the fluorescence ratios were linearly proportional to dna copy number even with a low-level gene-amplification or single-copy deletion.

detection of v-myc myelocytomatosis viral-related oncogene  amplification and analysis of the chromosome breakpoints
to characterize the ability of cgp to measure differences in copy number in genomic dna, we evaluated regional amplification in neuroblastoma-derived cell lines.

neuroblastoma is one of the most common pediatric solid tumors and accounts for 7–10% of all childhood cancers. the prognosis of patients varies according to stage, age and mycn amplification status. the mycn oncogene  is particularly important. since it was first described in  <dig>  <cit>  it has served a fundamental prognostic role for neuroblastoma patients. mycn amplification has been detected in more than 80% of neuroblastoma cell lines  <cit> , whereas other regions with high-level genomic amplification have rarely been observed. we verified mycn amplification in ten neuroblastoma cell lines by southern hybridization. this gene was amplified in all ten cell lines except sh-sy5y and nbl-s .

initially, the cgp assay was performed on all the neuroblastoma cell lines using  <dig> primers located approximately every  <dig>  mbps, spanning 2p <dig>  to 2q <dig>  and containing the mycn gene. in all the lines except sh-sy5y and nbl-s, cgp detected the amplified mycn gene  in agreement with the southern blot analysis. focusing on the region adjacent to the mycn gene locus, we generated  <dig> primers approximately every  <dig> kbps between 2p <dig>  and 2p <dig> . these primer sequences are supplied as the additional data file  <dig>  each cell line except sh-sy5y and nbl-s had an amplified region that was detected by the cgp assay. for instance, nbl-s cells showed no amplification in this region, whereas amplification was observed at 2p <dig>  in sk-n-dz and rtbm <dig>  of chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> ,708- <dig> , <dig> bp from 2pter, respectively), including amplification of the mycn gene . mycn amplification was detected in the tgw cell line, but it was accompanied by discontinuities between the top of the mycn gene and the middle of 2p <dig>  . the amplified region in the vicinity of the mycn gene is summarized in fig. 4d. only the neuroblastoma-amplified gene , dead  box polypeptide  <dig> , mycn and hypothetical protein loc <dig>  are present in this region between  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp and  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp from 2pter  <cit> . nag and ddx <dig> are reported to be co-amplified with the mycn gene in neuroblastoma  <cit> , but amplification of ddx <dig> and/or nag has no additional adverse effect on prognosis in this disease  <cit> .

comparing cgp to an oligonucleotide array
to compare cgp with microarrays, we used both methods to measure dna copy numbers on chromosome  <dig> in tgw cells. we chose the affymetrix genechip 50k hind array, which has a mean marker distance of  <dig> kb and has a resolution equal to the previous cgp experiments . an intensely amplified region was observed on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> . however, additional dna aberrations were detected only by cgp . in addition, no specific amplification of the mycn gene was detected by the affymetrix array because of a lack of probes in the mycn region.

discussion
in this study we describe a novel pcr-based method for detecting changes in genomic dna copy number. although techniques have been described that use ligation of synthetic oligonucleotides for genomic amplification and rna quantification, cgp is the first to use them for quantifying genomic dna  <cit> . in the cgp assay we used the psti restriction enzyme, which recognizes the  <dig> bp sequence ctgcag, to fractionate the dna. the high prevalence of psti sites in genomic dna offers a mapping resolution of approximately  <dig> =  <dig> bps, which is significantly greater than fish-based cgh . psti could be substituted by another enzyme such as saci, hindiii or xhoi  if no psti sites are present near the gene of interest.

cgp is capable of detecting small copy number differences such as xx versus xy, xxx, xxxx or xxxxx. the mean relative ratio values for chromosome x loci were  <dig>  for xy/xx,  <dig>  for xx/xx,  <dig>  for xxx/xx,  <dig>  for xxxx/xx and  <dig>  for xxxxx/xx, as shown in fig. 2d. these data are comparable to those obtained with array based-cgh  <cit> .

as a model for the study of gene amplification in human cancer, we focused on mycn gene copy alterations in neuroblastoma-derived cell lines. we used the cgp assay to detect gene amplification in each cell line at approximately every  <dig>  mbps in the vicinity of the mycn gene, and observed mycn gene amplification in all but two of the lines, sh-sy5y and nbl-s. furthermore, examination of the region adjacent to the mycn gene locus at approximately every  <dig> kbps revealed that these cell lines had a diversity of small region amplifications between  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp and  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp from 2pter . a recently updated gene assembly database showed that nag, ddx <dig>  mycn and fam49a map to this same region on chromosome  <dig>  these genes have previously been shown to be amplified in cancer, but it is also possible to use cgp to focus on or identify additional genes involved in cancer or other diseases.

owing to its robustness, pcr offers a reliable alternative to dna hybridization-based techniques. for example, quantitative pcr is routinely used to confirm results obtained by dna microarrays. thus, although the current versions of microarray-based techniques are sound, it is desirable to have an alternative pcr-based technique to confirm the results. real-time pcr has been used for this purpose but tedious calibration experiments make it difficult to use for high-throughput applications  <cit> . in cgh, two genomic sources are labeled with two different fluorescent dyes and hybridized in a single reaction vessel. because these labeled dnas are competitively hybridized to chromosomal dna or spotted bac dna, the ratio of the two dyes indicates quantitative differences in the particular locus of the genome. in cgp, two dna sources are differentiated after competitive pcr by the size of the adaptors. in principle, both techniques use a competitive reaction between two different genomic dna sources. as indicated by experiments with various numbers of x chromosomes, the cgp technique provided the desirable level of quantification. it should be noted that both techniques are limited in dynamic range: for example, the dynamic range of cgp would be up to about 20-fold as estimated from the results of adaptor-tagged competitive pcr  <cit> , a similar technique for quantifying rna.

cgp lends itself to applications in several specific cases. because the throughput of the technique is moderate, it is easy to profile chromosomal gains or losses at the resolution of conventional cgh. microarrays would be the method of choice for profiling the entire genome, and cgp may be used to complement it. in this study, cgp detected dna discontinuities that were not found with a microarray. this suggests that commercial arrays may miss chromosomal alterations because of gaps between probes. if a particular chromosomal region is important for a piece of research, more data points should be added, and cgp can be a useful tool for such purposes. the main merit of cgp is the ease with which any locus in the human  genome may be analyzed simply by making a single pcr primer. as shown by the example of mycn in neuroblastoma, high-resolution mapping of a particular genome locus is one of the major applications of cgp. such high-resolution mapping can be achieved with less cost and effort than hybridization-based techniques. in addition, the robustness of pcr would be advantageous in cases with limited dna sources such as those obtained by laser micro-beam dissection, a promising technique for cancer research.

the above applications of cgp are for research purposes. in the near future, it will be important to analyze the loss or gain of chromosomal loci for diagnosis. in such cases, cgp will be a rapid and accurate method and a strong candidate for clinical applications.

CONCLUSIONS
cgp is a moderate throughput pcr-based technique for analyzing changes in genomic copy number. because cgp can measure any genomic locus just by supplying pcr primers, it is especially useful for detailed analysis of a genomic region of interest at a higher resolution than commercial cgh arrays.
