BACKGROUND
protein-protein interactions play vital roles in regulating protein function and can provide valuable insight into the biological activity of proteins and biochemical pathways in which they function. the importance of protein interactions in biology has fueled intense efforts to identify such interactions and a vast repository of data has been accumulated over the years, particularly in relatively simple model organisms that are easier to manipulate genetically and biochemically. a number of bioinformatics-based approaches attempt to predict interactions using various techniques.

the budding yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, is one of the most comprehensively studied eukaryotic organisms and a substantial amount of biochemical and genetic data has been accumulated. after the publication of the s. cerevisiae genome a decade ago  <cit> , high throughput genetic and proteomic screens aimed at identifying novel genetic and protein interactions began complementing more traditional biochemical approaches  <cit> . we suspected that the voluminous data from yeast genes with human counterparts could be exploited more fully to provide better insights into human protein-protein interactions. yeast and humans represent extreme ends of the eukaryotic evolutionary spectrum. therefore the genes they share are often involved in fundamentally important cellular processes and represent an interesting set of genes which warrant further investigation. an example of a shared gene of particular interest to us was ing <dig> 

the founding member of the ing family of type ii tumor suppressors  was discovered using the method of subtractive hybridization aimed at identifying factors that were differentially expressed in normal mammary epithelial cells as opposed to breast cancer cell lines  <cit> . ectopic over-expression of ing <dig> was subsequently observed to promote g <dig> arrest and suppression of its expression led to transformation in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. other ing genes  have been subsequently identified in various mammalian genomes  <cit> . a significant number of tumors, either  harbour mutations within the ing genes,  have reduced expression of ing proteins, or  have altered ing protein subcellular localization. a large spectrum of cancers show attenuation of ing expression  and mechanistic studies have implicated the ing family in apoptosis, gene expression, senescence, hormone signaling and angiogenesis among others . the major mechanism through which ing proteins exert their effects is through altering chromatin structure by regulating hat and hdac activity  <cit> . this involves binding to differentially methylated histone h <dig> via the ing phd domain and also via binding to phosphatidylinositol monophosphates through the polybasic region near the phd  <cit> . binding is then believed to target associated hat or hdac complexes to chromatin regions, resulting in alteration of local histone acetylation states  <cit> . other regions of the ings have been shown to bind to pcna, 14-3- <dig>   <cit>  and cytoplasmic proteins such as liprin  <cit> . therefore, we wished to establish a comprehensive list of ing interacting proteins that would aid in the understanding of the complex role of this family of tumor suppressors in regulating diverse cellular functions. ing genes are evolutionarily conserved and members of the ing family have been identified across the animal and plant kingdoms including the yeast s. cerevisiae  <cit> .

krogan et al.  have described the use of tandem affinity purification  tagging followed by two different mass spectrometry methods, namely maldi-tof and lc-ms/ms, with the aim of assigning interacting partners to each of the yeast proteins  <cit> . an impressive 72% coverage of the predicted yeast proteome was made possible due to the increased sensitivity of tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry. we have used this study as the initiation point to determine the range of proteins that can interact with the ing family of proteins. here we attempt to elucidate human ing protein interactions based the recently published yeast interactome data  <cit> , hoping to identify real interactions in the long tail of low probability noisy interactions detected.

RESULTS
pairwise alignment of yngs  and human ings
the first member of the ing family  was discovered in humans  <cit>  and subsequently four more ing genes have been identified . homologs of ing proteins also exist throughout the animal and plant kingdoms  <cit> . three yeast proteins, yng <dig>  yng <dig> and yng <dig> , have been shown to bear considerable homology to the human ing <dig> protein in their c-terminal region and could functionally substitute for each other  <cit> . here we generated needleman-wunsch pairwise alignments between individual yeast and human ing proteins.  <cit> . sequences of ing1- <dig>  and yng1- <dig> were obtained from the ncbi genbank database . additionally, clustal-w  <cit> , t-coffee  <cit>  and geneious  were used to generate multiple sequence alignments, from which we derived the additional pairwise alignments shown in the additional file  <dig>  although the alignment scores were very close to each other, given the consistency of the results obtained from the various sequence alignment tools used, the following observations can be made:  yng <dig> shows the highest degree of sequence homology to ing <dig>   yng <dig> shows considerable homology to ing <dig> and ing <dig>  and  pho <dig> and ing <dig> are similar to each other. these results agree with previous reports of phylogenetic relationships among ing proteins  <cit>  and also with a recent report which attempts to classify ing proteins with respect to their association with either hat or hdac complexes  <cit> .

ing-interacting protein prediction
since members of the ing family of tumor suppressors show significant sequence conservation from yeast to humans  <cit> , we proposed that functional interactions might also be conserved. from the available yeast interactome data, it is evident that the yeast counterparts of the ing proteins, also referred to as yngs, interact with several other yeast proteins under normal physiological conditions  <cit> . we reasoned that although the majority of these interactions have very low probability scores, and hence are likely artifacts of the detection method, several of them may be transient, but nonetheless real interactions. because of the availability of a large amount of marginal, unanalyzed yeast interaction data  <cit> , we hypothesized there was potentially valuable untapped data to guide selection of human ing-interacting protein candidates. the yeast dataset has the advantage of being near saturation with regards to interactome coverage, so that almost all real interactions should be detected. our confidence was bolstered by the fact that many of the previously validated ing interactions in humans were also present in the yeast interactome data. we attempted to reconcile interactomes from multiple model organisms based on two different approaches: orthology  <cit>  and interaction network topology techniques  <cit> . neither provided new insights for novel ing interacting proteins. given the richness of available yeast data, we designed a new approach to better predict ing interactions. the bioinformatics workflow devised to filter down the massive lists of yeast interactions to a few salient candidates for biochemical validation is illustrated in figure  <dig>  and can be generalized to be useful for many other proteins.

identification of domains
since conservation of interacting partners is often a function of conservation of domain structure within  <cit>  or across species  <cit> , the next step was to identify the domain structure similarities between human and yeast ing family proteins. in order to characterize possible interaction domains of ing-like proteins quantitatively, we used an iterative consensus building processes. this process consisted of building initial hidden markov models , a position-specific amino acid substitution model of previously identified domains such as the leucine zipper-like  motif, plant homeodomain , potential chromatin regulatory  domain , nuclear localization signal , and peptide-interacting motif  using the multiple sequence alignments reported in  <cit> . these domain models were searched against the uniprot database   to identify proteins with domains closely related to the human ings. all uniprot proteins matching the human domain models were then added to the original model sequence to make them less species-specific and new hmms were built based on the expanded list of sequences. this process was repeated until no new uniprot matches were found. because uniprot contains data from many species, the iterative approach is a method to create domain models capturing sequence conservation amongst multiple species. the phylogenetic distribution and consensus sequences for the domains are illustrated in figure  <dig>  and significance thresholds are discussed later in this section.

the use of domain-specific models
since protein-protein interactions are primarily based on specific domains, we tried to generate domain-specific models of amino acid substitutions for the various annotated domains of the ing family proteins. this allowed us to statistically examine the validation of the domain models across species. results obtained from this method of analysis should be more sensitive and verifiable than the generalized substitution rates used by the current ortholog detection methods based on pairwise alignments. this improved sensitivity may be due to the accounting for the specific evolution of individual protein domains and/or the greater flexibility of hmms over simple pairwise alignments. the domain structure models generated using this approach were then used to identify possible ing-like proteins in model species for which interaction data is readily available. we investigated d. melanogaster, c. elegans, and s. cerevisiae interactome data as these species have the most extensively consolidated lists of protein-protein interactions.

we ran our generalized ing domain models against the proteomes of the above mentioned three species to verify if counterparts of human ing protein domains exist in them. the interaction databases to use depend on the conservation breadth of the gene to be investigated. only one of the domains was found to be conserved in a single protein in c. elegans . much better conservation of multiple ing domains was observed in s. cerevisiae and d. melanogaster. we therefore focused on identifying potential ing-interacting proteins in these two species. the domain conservation in these species is illustrated in figure  <dig>  as expected, the phd domain is highly conserved across all three, with the highest overall homology with human ing <dig>  also noteworthy is that the fly ing <dig> homolog contains an lzl domain, whereas the human version does not. the pcr domain is strongly conserved in all humans and fly ings, but is not present in yeast. it has recently been shown to interact specifically with lamin proteins and was subsequently renamed the lamin interaction domain . interestingly, the pim domain is weakly conserved in yeast's ing <dig> homolog, but not in fly. the pim was also recently renamed the polybasic region  since it harbours several basic residues and specifically binds signaling phospholipids  <cit> . the inclusion thresholds for each domain model were: pim 10- <dig>  phd 10- <dig>  nls 10- <dig>  pcr 10- <dig>  and lzl 10- <dig>  the thresholds represent the weakest e-value for any sequence used to create the domain model, i.e. the lowest score for a known positive example. the different thresholds are a consequence of the varying natures of the domain models . with the exception of pim , all domain matches are well above these thresholds. pim's somewhat weak score may reflect the fact that the domain model was built using only animal sequences .

identifying human orthologs
using the taxonomic search tools of magpie  <cit> , the  <dig> yeast genes were filtered to just those with human homologs. this left  <dig> genes that both interact with yngs in yeast, and have human orthologs . we reasoned that the probability of the yeast interaction being conserved in humans would be higher for those proteins that show homology in another higher eukaryote because this would be evidence for the maintenance of the interaction in the metazoan lineage. we filtered the ing-interacting proteins found in both yeast and human against the drosophila database as the drosophila ing showed high degree of domain conservation with the yeast and human ing proteins. of the  <dig> ing-interactors identified in fly by flybase  <cit> , only  <dig> had strong yeast homologs , and only  <dig> of these showed a high degree of sequence conservation in humans. these  <dig> fly genes  have  <dig> potential homologs in human, namely: hrpc <dig>  pak1b, map3k <dig> , p38mapka, and gspt <dig>  the venn diagram in figure  <dig> shows the overlapping sets of potential ing-interacting proteins in fly, yeast and human. the numbers shown beside the interactions involving fly represent interaction probability  <cit> . all yeast interactions shown are  <dig>  or  <dig>  using the probability scale from the data in  <cit> . the homology statistics for yeast, fly and human ing-interactors that were used to construct the venn diagram can be found in additional file  <dig> 

biochemical validation of potential human ing protein interactions
in order to select candidates for biochemical validation of human ing interactors, we compared our data with experimentally validated ing interactions in human, as listed in the string database  <cit> . nine of the ten experimentally validated human ing interactors with yeast homologs in the  <dig> gene list had extremely weak interactions   <cit> . it therefore seems reasonable to biochemically validate any of the  <dig> potential human homologs, even though they had similarly low probability scores according to available yeast data. the fact that none of the  <dig> candidate human homologs were found in the validated list of ing interaction from the string database is not surprising, since the human interactome dataset is at present not nearly as saturated as that of yeast.

to restrict the list of  <dig> candidates further, we considered the biological relevance of the potential interactions to the known functions of ings. accordingly, the choice was amongst pak1b, map3k <dig>  and p38mapka in descending order of homology among the  <dig> species . we also selected another gene  that does not fulfill all of the requirements of our method, but which is predicted by string. rad <dig> has a weak yeast interaction score but an extremely strong homolog  in humans. we wanted to test if in such cases the yeast data could be used alone in successfully predicting human ing interactors.

based on scientific relevance of the interactions , we chose to biochemically validate three putative interactions  using co-immunoprecipitation  followed by western blot analysis. as shown in figure 5a, ip-western analyses indicated that endogenous rad <dig> specifically interacted with endogenous ing <dig>  since the other two proteins that we chose to investigate, mekk <dig> and p38mapk are closely linked in a stress pathway  <cit> , we chose to confirm these interactions under both normal and stress conditions approaches, namely uv. figure 5b shows that overexpressed p38mapk and overexpressed mekk <dig> showed strong signals in ing <dig> immunoprecipitates, but not in the negative control glutathione-s-transferase  immunoprecipitates. figure 5c shows that ing <dig> immunocomplexes from untransfected cells, but not gst immunocomplexes, contain both p38mapk and mekk <dig>  confirming that this interaction occurs between endogenous proteins. unlike the case for ing1-pcna interaction that is increased by uv-induced stress  <cit> , treatment of cells with a uv dose sufficient to induce a stress response did not markedly alter the degree of kinase-ing <dig> interaction. input lanes also show that robust signals were obtained for both the p38mapk and mekk <dig> proteins in control western blots of lysates used, under conditions where little, if any, signal was seen for ing <dig>  this indicates that high levels of the kinases are expressed in our experimental cell system, compared to ing <dig> protein. relatively high expression levels of the kinases compared to ing <dig> likely explains why reciprocal ip-western assays did not clearly demonstrate a detectable interaction , since only a small portion of the kinases would be expected to interact with ing <dig> protein based upon their apparent relative stoichiometry.

comparison to existing datasets and methods
to evaluate the combined contribution of krogan et al. marginal data and our prediction technique to the study of protein-protein interactions, we compared our results to those obtained from biochemical surveys, and other prediction algorithms  <cit> . through an evaluation of the completeness of current yeast and human protein-protein interaction networks, we propose that making raw unfiltered results available to all researchers could help distinguish between real and spurious interactions. table  <dig> summarizes the few ing interactions we could extract from the available datasets surveyed by hart et al.  <cit> , covering most of the commonly used techniques, from yeast two-hybrid to tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry. unfiltered experimental data is only available in very few of the datasets listed in table  <dig>  therefore we observed how many of the ing interactions in other datasets also occurred in the unfiltered krogan dataset, and how well they matched our technique's criteria. it is clear from the data that yng/ing is poorly represented in several datasets, and that different methods produced different biases in which ing is detected. this supports the notion by hart et al. that even the well-studied yeast interactome is only about 50% elucidated by existing filtered datasets.

^medium confidence experimental reports

based on our success in identifying valid ing interacting proteins from the unfiltered dataset in krogan et al., we strongly agree with hart et al. that the research community would be much better served by the release of raw interaction datasets in general for comparison and consolidation. additionally, some original datasets, such as those from ito el al., were only available via the internet archive  as the original web links referenced in the papers no longer exist.

other bioinformatics-based approaches have been used to predict interactions between proteins . sequence, domain, and motif structure based approaches form the basis of bayesian network models  <cit> . examining co-evolution of interacting proteins by comparing phylogenetic trees  <cit> , correlating mutations  <cit> , or gene fusion  <cit>  also rely on sequence based approaches. protein domain interface-based approaches  <cit>  also exist. other approaches such as gene expression, gene ontology annotations, and transcriptional regulation, can also be used to predict whether or not a group of proteins are members of the same complex. our attempts to use conventional protein-protein interaction prediction tools  <cit>  on ing and yng proteins did not yield results beyond those described in the various public interaction repositories  or predicted by literature text mining. an exhaustive comparison of our technique to others is beyond the scope of this paper, but table  <dig> summarizes the results of searching for ing1/2/ <dig> interactions employing various techniques.

* the concurring interactor, cdc <dig>  was excluded from the  <dig> core predictions of this work due to weakness of the human homolog 

it must be noted that our core predictions  do not overlap with other ortholog-based techniques  <cit> , which would be the most natural comparison to make. interestingly, our two marginal predictions, pdi <dig> and cdc <dig>  agree with some methods in table  <dig>  the fact that none of the core predictions overlaps, but marginal ones do highlights the fact that different techniques were used to define orthologs. all of the methods in table  <dig> used either inparanoid  <cit>  or homologene  <cit>  to define interspecies gene mappings. the former maps only yng <dig> and pho <dig> to the human counterparts we have identified, while the latter maps all three yeast ing equivalents to ing <dig> 

the uniqueness of our core predictions suggests that the technique we have developed provides added value over a straightforward multi-species prediction tools. given an unfiltered dataset, it is possible that some of the techniques used in table  <dig> that employ existing biochemical data would also predict some or all of our five candidate interactions. however, we are unaware of any follow-up studies by the authors of those tools using a raw dataset. it is not unreasonable to assume that the level of false positive predictions from these tools would increase substantially without some changes to their algorithms, which were built for "clean" input datasets. in contrast, we err on the side of false negatives by using strict 1) multi-species criteria and 2) gene-family specific domain models to cast a highly restrictive "lens" on krogan et al's massive unfiltered dataset. this explains why our methodology is complementary to the existing techniques. we do not suggest that our technique will find all true positives, because interactions are not always shared between multiple species, and not all interactions have been elucidated. rather, our technique provides guidance for researchers working on proteins whose interactions are not successfully predicted using existing techniques .

discussion
in this study we have shown that a high degree of conservation of the ing proteins exists between human and yeast based on their interactions with analogous proteins across these species. this is consistent with previous reports showing conservation of ing protein sequence, particularly in specific domains  <cit> , and conservation of function in regulating chromatin structure through associations with hat and hdac complexes . in addition to the specific interactions that we have confirmed experimentally, our work highlights the fact that many additional potential and novel interactions may occur between analogous proteins in these two organisms. over  <dig>  proteins were reported to interact with yngs  <cit>  and of these proteins, we found that  <dig> had identified homologs in human cells. based on our magpie analysis and initial examination of three of the proposed interactions, many of the set of  <dig> proteins are likely to also interact with human ings. the in silico approach we have designed allowed us to predict new protein-protein interactions for the human ings with a high degree of success and confirmed many previously elucidated interactions such as those with p <dig>  karyopherin, hat/hdac proteins and histone h <dig> 

our findings suggest that ing family proteins are involved in a more diverse array of biological processes than are presently suspected from the current literature and some of the interactions suggest possible additional mechanisms that might underlie their tumor suppressor capabilities. the three new interactions we have elucidated and biochemically confirmed here, rad <dig>  p38mapk and mekk <dig>  further link ing <dig> to dna damage/stress response pathways  <cit> . ing interaction with rad <dig>  an important component of the mre11-rad50-nbs <dig> complex, gives credence to previous reports linking ing proteins to dna damage signaling and repair pathways via pcna and gadd <dig>  <cit> .

in an attempt to understand the connection between the ing, mekk <dig>  and p38mapk protein interaction networks, we generated a merged interaction graph . several reports have indicated that different forms of stress, such as uv, chemotherapeutic agents and hypoxia affect the function of the ing proteins  <cit> . the mammalian jnk/p38map kinase kinase kinase  and the yeast  ssk2p protein are homologous, with mekk <dig> being able to replace all of the known functions of ssk2p in yeast. the stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathways are integral components of diverse stress signaling pathways such as uv, hypoxia, heat, osmotic shock, ph, oxidative damage, cytokines, pheromones and others  <cit> . the fact that ing <dig> can interact with both mekk <dig> and p38mapk is not surprising given the facts that all three proteins are evolutionarily conserved, bear common links to several different signaling pathways, both ing <dig> and mekk <dig> bind to gadd <dig>  <cit>  and both mekk <dig> and p38mapk are in a well defined stress response pathway  <cit> . this observation is also consistent with reports that ing proteins affect transcription factor activity  <cit>  since the mekk4/p38mapk stress activated kinase cascade culminates in the regulation of various transcription factors, some of which are outlined in figure  <dig>  analysis of the effects of altering ing <dig> activity on mekk4/p38mapk signaling under different conditions of extracellular and intracellular stress should serve to better clarify the roles that physical interaction of ing <dig> with these proteins plays in the mammalian stress response cascades. since several other ing-interacting partners showed similar degrees of interaction, it is tempting to speculate that further examination of the additional candidate ing-interacting pathways we have identified in multiple model organisms, and particularly in yeast, will shed further light on the function of the ing family of chromatin regulators.

the overall philosophy of the prediction procedure outlined in figure  <dig> is to examine the large number of interactions detected in yeast for a given protein, regardless of their probability scores, and then to reduce the list to a few candidates. this reduction is accomplished by successively keeping only the overlap of: 1) domain occurrence, and 2) interaction pairs, in at least three species. this approach stands in contrast to current automated prediction methods based on just one or two species, which often use only relatively high-scoring interaction data to prevent too many false positive predictions. the success of our approach, with the test case of ing <dig>  suggests that the large quantity of low-scoring interaction data available in yeast is currently underutilized.

our approach is semi-automatable , but the researcher must: 1) assist in creating the multiple sequence alignments of domains, and 2) select biologically tenable interactions from the final shortlist generated. the procedure focuses on one gene  at a time, and is not specific to ing proteins, but rather can be applied to any human gene with equivalents in yeast. we expect researchers who concentrate on a specific gene can beneficially use this focused approach to interaction prediction when generalized, large-scale prediction services do not yield good results.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a method using comparisons in different organisms in which homologs exist, to predict with a high degree of certainty what particular protein interactions found in unfiltered data may occur in vivo and contribute to the activities of, in this case, the ing proteins. this cross-species  bioinformatics-based approach was used to identify potential human ing <dig> interacting proteins with higher probability and accuracy than approaches based on screens in a single species. we confirm the validity of this screen and show that ing <dig> interacts specifically with three proteins tested: p38mapk, mekk <dig>  and rad <dig>  these novel ing-interacting proteins further link ing proteins to cell stress and the dna damage signaling, providing previously unknown upstream links to dna damage response pathways in which ing <dig> participates.
