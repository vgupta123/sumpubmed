BACKGROUND
post-translational histone modifications are known to be altered in cancer tissues and to contribute to the development and progression of cancer . histone modifications can occur over large regions of chromatin, including coding regions and non-promoter sequences, and these are referred to as global histone modifications . mutations, mis-regulation of gene expression, or attenuated post-translational modifications can impair the activity of histone-modifying enzyme complexes, and this may affect the mechanism that regulates global histone modifications throughout the genome. currently, the consequences of altered histone-modifying enzyme activity are linked to inappropriate expression of a few genes that might function in tumorigenesis  <cit> . changes in global histone modification patterns  can be informative, particularly as predictors of prognosis, various steps of carcinogenesis, and responses to chemotherapy  <cit> . therefore, in this study, we aim to develop a new data mining approach for discovery and interpretation of differential ghmps in cancer, and we use it to investigate whether an understanding of epigenetic alterations in cancer cells can expand prognostic capabilities.

for ghmps, the complexity of patterns discovered can be explained by using the histone code hypothesis  <cit> , which states that each of four histones can be simultaneously modified in a site specific manner with different degrees of change in different modifications. for an example of this complexity, consider the following: histone h <dig> contains  <dig> lysine residues known to be methylated, and each lysine can be un-, mono-, di-, or tri-methylated. if modifications are considered to be independent, this allows a potential  <dig> or  <dig> billion different lysine methylation patterns, which is more than the maximum number of histones in the human genome   <cit> . in this context, the problem of discovering the combinatorial chromatin modification patterns  that exist on a genome-wide scale can be considered an np-complete  problem  <cit> . to date, various computational methods based on heuristic algorithms have been developed for the identification of ghmps and ccmps. additionally, with the recent advances in next generation sequencing technology, new computational methods exploiting machine learning and data mining algorithms are being developed to detect histone modification patterns in genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation -seq data sets. for instance, supervised learning based methods can identify and predict functional dna elements  with chromatin signatures for known regulatory elements using classification algorithms such as artificial neural networks  <cit>  and hidden markov models   <cit> . the advantage of these supervised methods is their ability to predict the undiscovered regulatory elements that drive cell-type-specific gene expression.

un-supervised learning algorithms can be applied to identify ghmps and discover novel ccmps that can characterise unknown regulatory elements. a range of algorithms are adapted to achieve this, including probabilistic profiles , bi-clustering , hmms , dynamic bayesian networks , and dynamic programming . in contrast to some other unsupervised methods , chromhmm and segway, which segment the genome into distinct chromatin states, are advantageous to identify patterns of sequential chromatin modifications , and the final ccmps are forced to include all chromatin modification marks in the input data  <cit> . chromhmm and segway focus on chromatin-centric genome annotations in order to assign and predict the final labels of chromatin states for given genome segments with chromatin marks. chat can discriminate the same combinatorial patterns of histone modifications with different shapes by using dynamic programming to measure the similarity of the chromatin signatures for genome partitions, but it may capture local signatures rather than those that occur globally.

despite the development of many computational methods designed to elucidate combinatorial patterns of histone modifications and decipher the complex histone code, how ccmps can be incorporated into the elaborate epigenetic model of cancer in contrast to normal cells has not been determined. large-scale epigenomic projects have generated a vast number of epigenomes, including various types of histone modification and other epigenetic marks, for multiple human cell types and disease progression . however, the development of computational methods for discovery of combinatorial patterns of chromatin state differences between different cell types and conditions has not been investigated. the discovery of de novo combinatorial patterns of differential chromatin modifications across tissues, cell types, and disease phases, is a non-trivial task. the validity of such a computational method can be determined by assessing its ability to extract novel biological knowledge from the patterns associated with various functional genomic features.

in this regard, we report charm, a new computational approach based on association rule mining , which is de novo pattern discovery of differential chromatin modifications that occur globally in hepatocellular carcinoma  tissues of hepatitis b virus x -transgenic mice. charm computationally characterises these patterns to interpret their biological significance. by applying arm to three different types of histone lysine methylation, dna methylation, and rna polymerase ii  phosphorylation on a genome-wide scale, we discovered  <dig>  association rules that were expressed as combinatorial patterns of differential chromatin modifications. we identified a cancer-specific de novo global pattern, i.e. the combination of three histone modifications, namely a loss of h3k4me <dig> and gains of h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig>  in both promoters and gene bodies. charm is an unsupervised approach for incorporating global ccmps into epigenetic models of cancer, providing combinatorial patterns that discriminate hbx and normal  tissue. the patterns are expressed with descriptive rules that are straightforward and simple to interpret.

RESULTS
a global view of the discovered association rules
an overall systematic workflow of the ccmp discovery process is shown in fig.  <dig>  this comprises transformation of our chip-seq data from continuous to categorical, arm of the transformed chip-seq data, and clustering of association rules for the visualization and interpretation of patterns . arm was applied to promoter and gene body regions separately. all the association rules exceeded the thresholds of supports, confidence, and lifts were generated. in total,  <dig> rules  for promoters and  <dig>  rules  for gene bodies  were discovered by the ccmp procedure described in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> a work flow diagram of the charm method


there were  <dig> rules and  <dig> rules discovered by arm for promoters and gene bodies, respectively. from these rules, we selected those encoding pattern  <dig>  and its supersets with high lift values, which were within the top  <dig> or top  <dig> highest lift values from all the rules as representative examples. in the table, we also report rules in the top  <dig> supports


asupp: support of a rule


bconf: confidence of a rule


cannotation: annotation of the rules corresponding to their categories




to extract and interpret interesting ccmps from all the discovered rules, we employed existing tools such as treeview and gene cluster  <dig>  to produce a heatmap representing the global view of all the association rules. this heatmap, clustered by chromatin modification marks, represents the combinatorial effects of chromatin modification states . each association rule  encodes a pattern or signature of the combination of differentially modified states of chromatin. high support values can indicate globally modified patterns, and high lift values can signify the degree of co-occurrence. we filtered out rules presenting combinations of all unmodified states. the remaining rules were sorted by support and lift. sorting by support has the same effect as rules were clustered by number of modifications in rules. after sorting by these two metrics, interesting rules were easily explored.fig.  <dig> a global view of the chromatin modification patterns encoded in association rules. a all epigenetic signatures of chromatin modifications and pattern  <dig>  each row corresponds to an association rule  and each column to a chromatin modification mark. rules  are clustered by chromatin modification marks. the colour in each cell indicates the differential change of marks in the livers of normal and hbx-transgenic mice. light green and light red represent the extreme chromatin modification changes, e.g. hypo or hyper methylation of histone, respectively. the epigenetic signatures were tightly clustered into two groups, representing the modified and unmodified states of chromatin. association rules in the yellow rectangles represent the epigenetic signatures of pattern  <dig>  which constitutes the combination of the loss of h3k4me <dig> and the gains of h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig>  b plots for the support and lift of the association rules. the grey scale represents the confidence levels and the coloured rectangles correspond to supersets of pattern  <dig>  which contained the three modified states of pattern  <dig> as well as other chromatin marks. the rule length, which corresponds to the number of modified states, is >  <dig>  red, yellow, and blue rectangles correspond to rule length  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively




a combination of three histone modified states  showed the highest frequency  among all possible combinations  in the gene bodies , and it was the k-th most frequent itemset , where k stands for the number of different chromatin modified states in a combination. three association rules  were derived from this frequent itemset. in fig. 2a, association rules in dashed yellows rectangles encode the notable combinations of differentially modified states that were derived from all possible subsets or supersets of the most frequent itemset.

in promoters, the combinations of unmodified states were common and present comprising a majority of the association rules with high frequency . the combination of three histone modified states  in the promoter was the k-th most frequent itemset  after filtering the combinations of any three unmodified states . thus, we identified a global histone modification pattern, named pattern  <dig>  which denotes the combinatorial effect of the loss of h3k4me <dig> and the gains of h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> . pattern  <dig> was discovered in both promoters  and gene bodies . table  <dig> also lists a variety of other rules that form parts of the supersets and subsets of pattern  <dig>  we refined pattern  <dig> to reduce potential false positives and derived fine patterns . lift was employed to measure the independence of a rule and as a metric for the importance of a rule in terms of measuring co-occurrence of chromatin modifications. the lift values of the association rules encoding pattern  <dig> were high  as shown in rules 1– <dig> and rules 15– <dig> . with the exception of two rules , the supersets of pattern  <dig> , which consisted of more than three chromatin modified states, had higher lift values than the original pattern  <dig> .

it is notable that  <dig>  of  <dig> supersets  from g <dig> had high lift values  and the top  <dig> lifts of these supersets ranked within the top 1 % of highest lifts of all the association rules . the high lift values of these supersets shows that the combination of three histone methylation marks  in pattern  <dig> appeared together more often than expected, and that the pattern more likely co-occurred with other modifications such as rna polymerase changes and dna methylation. as more chromatin marks combined, the lift tended to increase , implying a higher possibility for co-occurrence. these results suggest the possibility of interplay between three histone methylation marks in the pattern, which results from cross-talks between trimethylation of lysine  <dig>  lysine  <dig>  and lysine  <dig> 

except for rules in table  <dig> and pattern  <dig>  we found a promoter pattern representing the combination of four modifications  but that mainly denotes loss of h3k27me <dig> and gain of h3k4me <dig>  we also identified other patterns such as pattern  <dig> and pattern  <dig> in gene bodies. pattern  <dig> presents the combination of three modified states . supersets and subsets of pattern  <dig> are in  <dig> rules. pattern  <dig> denotes losses of all three histone modifications and encoded in  <dig> rules.

negative relationships between h3k27me <dig> and other marks characterise pattern 155
the relationships among the epigenetic marks in pattern  <dig> were compared to those of all other genes in either hbx-transformed cells or normal cells by using correlation network analysis based on the ress  of chip-seq signals. interestingly, we observed negative relationships between h3k27me <dig> and other marks in pattern  <dig> , but not among all genes in either normal or hbx-transformed liver cells . specifically, h3k27me <dig> changes were negatively correlated with h3k4me <dig>  pol2s <dig>  gene expression, and cpg content in pattern  <dig> . these negative relationships are not replicated in random samples and had a low probability of occurring by chance . therefore, it is possible that the negative relationships between h3k27me <dig> and other marks significantly affect epigenetic modifications in hbx.fig.  <dig> correlation network of epigenetic modifications. the correlation networks were generated from correlations  between chromatin modification marks of transcripts in  p <dig>  the promoter pattern for the hbx tg livers, b normal cells, and  hbx tg liver cells. each node represents a chromatin modification mark and each edge width was weighted by pearson correlation values . green edges represent negative correlations and grey edges represent positive correlations. each node name represents the abbreviated chromatin mark name: h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  pol2s <dig>  met, h <dig>  hx_exn, and pcpg_ratio denote h3k4me <dig>  h3k27m <dig>  h3k36me, pol ii s <dig>  dna methylation, h <dig>  expression in hbx, and cpg ratio, respectively




in pattern  <dig>  the cpg content was negatively associated with dna methylation and h3k27me <dig> in p155s, while it had a weak positive relationship with h3k27me <dig> in g155s . these negative relationships differ from the positive relationships observed for both h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> in hbx transformed cells for all genes, whereas such positive relationships were either not observed or were weak  in normal cells. the negative relationships observed between h3k27me <dig> and other marks in pattern  <dig> are compatible with the results of arm , and they can be considered as hbx-specific epigenetic modifications.

enrichment of functional genomic elements in pattern 155
we measured the enrichment of the functional elements associating pattern  <dig> in terms of odds relating to the relative proportion of functional elements in the mouse genome. the relative enrichment between the functional elements was then calculated as odd ratios . in the pattern, there was a propensity for genes to non-genes , promoters to genes , exons to introns , and utr <dig> to utr <dig> . interestingly, the pattern was enriched in genic regions and promoters rather than non-genic regions, and preferentially matched within exons with particularly coding regions and utr5s.table  <dig> enrichment of functional elements in the patterns

epigenetic profiles of genes in pattern 155
the average epigenetic profiles of the genes in p <dig> were measured in terms of res values around the transcription start site . in normal cells, the p <dig> genes showed a strong h3k4me <dig> peak around the tss , which was not present in hbx cells . this finding is in concordance with previous work  <cit> . conversely, the signals of h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> increased in hbx cells compared to normal cells . interestingly, the signals for these two marks did not change around the tss, whereas the change in h3k4me <dig> was drastic. however, these signals peaked at both sides of the tss, i.e. around − <dig> to −200 bp and + <dig> to +400 bp.fig.  <dig> epigenetic profiles of p <dig>  a differential changes of histone modifications between hbx tg and normal livers in pattern  <dig>  the plotted data are the dres values summed over the member genes of pattern  <dig> . promoter regions are divided into three regions relative to tss: proximal , intermediate  and distal . vertical grey lines in each figure represent the three promoter regions. b, c and d) a comparison between hbx and normal livers for  h3k4me <dig>  c h3k27me <dig>  and  h3k36me <dig>  b shows that h3k4me <dig> was hypermethylated near the tss regions in normal livers, whereas it underwent demethylation in hbx, displaying a strong negative peak in . e and f the changes in histone modification for  hcps  and  lcps  in pattern  <dig>  blue bars in represent regions matched with pattern  <dig>  dres changes of h3k4me <dig>  h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> from ,  and  are coloured green, red, purple, respectively. dk <dig>  dk <dig> and dk <dig> stand for h3k4me <dig>  h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig>  respectively




both h3k36me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> were minimally changed around the tss regions in the livers of normal and hbx mice; however, at the intermediate promoter regions, i.e. – <dig> to −200 bp upstream of the tss, the changes were substantially different between the two conditions . in addition, the highest peaks of h3k36me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> changes in hbx were found in intermediate promoter regions, i.e. – <dig> to −600 bp from the tss.

pattern  <dig> is enriched in high cpg content
many previous studies  have addressed the association between cpg islands  and epigenetic and functional regions. in concordance with this previous work, pattern  <dig> was characterised with high cpg content  and strongly associated with high cpg density in promoters and gene bodies . we found that  <dig>  % of the promoter pattern p <dig> consisted of high cpg content promoters , whereas a small fraction  of p <dig> contained low cpg content promoters . the enrichment of hcps in p <dig> was statistically significant in comparison with the promoters in the mouse genome . hcg was also significant in the gene body pattern g <dig> . we plotted cpg ratio distribution along the promoter regions and found strong aggregated peaks  ~650 bp upstream of the tss . hcps  showed an analogous cpg distribution to p <dig> where high peaks of cpg ratio were densely concentrated on the two specific regions, the proximal  and distal promoter  regions. some cpg ratio peaks in lcps were more likely to be found in proximal regions surrounding the tss up to 300 bp upstream and in intermediate promoter regions  ; however, these peaks were not as high as those of the hcps, and the peak regions were shallow.fig.  <dig> cpg ratio bias in pattern  <dig>  cpg ratio distributions in promoters and gene bodies for p <dig> , g <dig> , and all transcripts . a in promoters, a high peak for the cpg ratio in p <dig> was observed where the cpg ratio was >  <dig> , whereas two peaks were found for all transcripts, one in the low cpg ratio and one in high cpg ratio. b the cpg ratio distribution in gene bodies: 57 % of the g <dig> shows high cpg content . all transcripts and p <dig> show high peaks in the low cpg ratio .  cpg ratio distributions alongside promoter regions for all transcripts: c hcps  and  lcps of p <dig>  e the proportion of  <dig> base pair intervals matched to pattern  <dig> that corresponds to hcps, icps, and lcps alongside promoter regions. hcps are more likely to match in intermediate or distal promoter regions, whereas lcps are likely to match in proximal promoter regions around the tss




we also investigated the possibility that pattern matched regions in gene bodies  were associated with cgis and other features of the mouse genome . cgis in g <dig> were preferentially enriched in utr <dig> vs. utr <dig>  and coding exons vs. intronic regions  compared with those of the mouse genome, suggesting that the gene body pattern was enriched in highly functional regions of the genome  overlapping with high cpg content.

changes in histone modifications are associated with cpg distribution
the shape of the cpg ratio distribution along with promoter regions  was associated with the changes of each histone modification mark in p <dig> . the hypomethylated regions of h3k4me <dig> around the tss   overlapped with the high peaks  of the cpg ratio distribution . the peaks of h3k36me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> appeared in intermediate regions and the distal promoter regions , overlapped with low cpg content regions .

variations of each histone modification mark in the pattern were distinctively characterised in response to each promoter class . the variations in histone modifications in hcps resembled those of the p <dig>  whereas those in lcps were similar to the p <dig> but with different shapes. some cpg shore regions  between hcps and lcps showed peaks of h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig>  these observations imply that the variations of histone modifications in hcps of the pattern rendered the main signature of the pattern, which were weakly preserved in lcps. these observations are consistent with the results of the correlation network analysis for p <dig> , indicating that cpg content has a positive relationship with h3k4me <dig> changes and a negative relationship with h3k27me <dig> changes in hbx.

comparison with random sampling
p <dig> comprises both hcps and lcps according to their cpg content. we examined whether epigenetic signatures of these groups are different from those observed in the mouse genome. to do so, both hcps and lcps in p <dig> were compared to those of randomly chosen sets. the drastic changes of h3k4me <dig> around the tss regions were conserved in randomly selected top k  hcps  with high cpg ratios  from the mouse genome . we observed the loss of h3k4me <dig> around the proximal promoter regions with high cpg content in comparison with the change of h3k4me <dig> in randomly selected top k lcps , where k =  <dig> and cpg ratio ≤  <dig>  . changes of h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> in pattern  <dig> were not reproduced in rhcps  and rlcps . for example, all three histone marks in rhcps showed relative demethylation alongside the promoter regions, particularly those with high cpg ratios . however, in p <dig>  h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> remained unmethylated or unmodified in the proximal promoter regions and gained in the intermediate promoter regions , which were distinguished from rhcps. rlcps were devoid of pattern  <dig>  which was rather weak but conserved in lcps.

this examination of random sampling suggests that high peak regions of cpg ratio are associated with a loss of h3k4me <dig>  while regions with low cpg ratio in both promoter classes show high peaks of h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> 

relationships with polii activity, dna methylation, and gene expression
overall, rna polymerase activity  was strongly correlated with each mark of pattern  <dig>  in both p <dig> and g <dig>  negative relationships between polii and h3k27me <dig>  and between polii and h3k36me <dig>  were different from the relationships among all transcripts . this observation is apparent in regions where serine  <dig>  or serine  <dig>  phosphorylation of rna polymerase ii decreased by more than a  <dig>  differential res  between hbx and normal livers , particularly in the promoter pattern . in p <dig>  the promoter pattern was associated with unchanged states of dna methylation . however, the gene body pattern was associated with both gain and loss of dna methylation . exons overlapping with cgi in g <dig> also tended to be hypomethylated, which is rather strongly observed in more than  <dig>  res hypomethylation . most of the genes in pattern  <dig> were not differentially expressed between normal and hbx-transformed cells. those that were differentially expressed were down-regulated . in rna-seq,  <dig>  out of  <dig> differential expressed genes were down-regulated. the relationships observed in the network analysis between each mark and gene expression were also observed in down-regulated genes in p <dig> .fig.  <dig> relationships between histone methylations, polii, dna methylation, and gene expression. a relationships between poliis <dig> changes and each of three histone methylation marks in the promoters. b relationships between dna methylation and histone methylation in gene bodies. in  and , a green background represents the changes of all transcripts, while red , blue , and purple  rectangles represent the changes of  p155s and  g155s. yellow rectangles in each plot correspond to the genes for which  poliis <dig> or  dna methylation decreased . c gene expression in normal and hbx tg mouse livers, as measured by rna-seq and exon array . the majority of genes in p <dig> were not differentially expressed . among the differentially expressed genes in p <dig>  substantially more genes were down-regulated  than up-regulated 




interpretation of functional annotations
according to david functional enrichment analysis and ingenuity pathway analysis , both the promoter pattern and gene body pattern showed similar functions . both promoter and gene body patterns were enriched in the ‘transcription regulator activity’, ‘dna binding’, and ‘transcription factor activity’ functional categories, as indicated by gene ontology  and protein information resource  keyword annotations  in david.table  <dig> enriched functional terms and canonical pathways, identified using david and ingenuity pathway analysis

acanonical pathways were outputs from ipa analysis; other significant functional annotation terms were obtained from david analysis




ipa generated seven significant canonical pathways  for the promoter pattern and one significant pathway, notch signalling, for the gene body pattern  . out of the seven significant canonical pathways for the promoter pattern, ‘molecular mechanism of cancer’ implied that genes in promoter patterns could play a role in molecular pathways for cancer. significant pathways such as wnt/β-catenin , ras  and camp mediated  are already known to be involved in the pathogenesis of human hcc development . the role of nfat  in cardiac hypertrophy  <cit>  in our ipa analysis can be explained by a similar role as a factor in hbx related hcc through previous work . for instance, it was reported that hbx activates transcription and nuclear translocation of nfat regulating cytokine encoding genes such as tnf-α whose production was observed in chronic liver injury and inflammation leading to development of hcc  <cit> . the notch signalling pathway, which was significantly enriched in the gene body pattern, mediates tumour invasion in hcc, which suggests that inhibition of notch signalling pathway inhibitors could suppress invasion of hcc cells via the extra cellular signal-regulated kinases  <dig> and  <dig>  signalling pathways  <cit> .

functional annotations for differential expressed genes  using david were shown in additional file5: table s <dig>  in terms of biological process and functions, they are involved in regulation of cell death and metabolism of xenotiotics by cytochrome p <dig> while genes in pattern  <dig> are enriched in regulation of transcription and transcription factor activity.

taken together, previous studies largely verified the pivotal roles played by the eight significant pathways we identified using ipa and our findings were consistent with the current knowledge regarding hbx-induced hcc.

discussion
in this study, we developed charm, an unsupervised approach that uses arm, a well-known method for finding frequent patterns in large databases, for the discovery and interpretation of de novo combinatorial epigenetic modification patterns that occur globally in a cancer cell line. we applied charm to investigate an hbx-transformed mouse liver tumour model and discovered an aberrant histone modification pattern . the pattern characterised with cpg content of underlying dna sequences-h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> hypermethylation in hbx occurred in intermediate promoter regions where cpg ratio is low. there is a possibility those signals reflected by neighbouring genes intersecting with the promoter regions of the pattern. in some cases, the gains of h3k36me <dig> were observed in exonic regions of neighbouring upstream genes or overlapping ests, implying that exonic enhancers function in promoter regions. as we found in correlation network analysis, a positive relationship between h3k4me <dig> and cpg content and negative relationships between h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> and cpg content were conserved in the patterns, whereas these relationships were not replicated in the whole mouse genome and random samples. the pattern observed in this study was enriched in functional elements such as utr <dig>  coding exons, and promoters, in response to cpg content. the pattern was associated with pol <dig> activity and gene expression, where a small portion of genes in the promoter pattern showed mostly down-regulated expression. interestingly, while the majority of the genes in the promoter pattern showed no significant changes in expression levels, the pivotal roles played by some of these genes  in hcc progression has already been highlighted in previous studies  <cit> , suggesting that these specific genes in the pattern could be potential predictors of epigenetic prognosis in hbx. the significant canonical pathways enriched in the pattern accounted for the pathogenesis of hbx; for example, notch signalling, and wnt/β-catenin, camp mediated, and ras pathways, are linked to a general cancer pathway. our results indicate that histone modifications in the promoter pattern could regulate mis-expression of the downstream genes. the observation that most genes were down-regulated suggests that the genes in the pattern may play a role in inhibition of oncogenic pathways in hbx and, therefore, they could be candidates for further investigation of the epigenetic mechanisms in hbx.

from a methodological perspective, the features of charm are comparable to those of existing computational methods  <cit> . for epigenetic therapeutic targets, there has been more emphasis on identifying global patterns of combinatorial chromatin signatures. in this context, arm is able to extract all the possible combinations from  <dig> to k-th large itemsets, which are composed of k constituent modifications that meet minimum support and lift from a large chromatin modification data. however, the three existing methods  work well for identifying locally aligned similar signatures of different modifications whilst charm can identify combinatorial patterns composed of distally related peaks of different modifications . because degrees of confidence, support, and lift are provided in the rules of the method, biologists could determine differential patterns between different cell types more easily than with some existing methods such as chromhmm based on hmm, segway based on dynamic bayesian networks, chat based on dynamic programming, and hierarchical clustering and chromasig that use probability profiles. most of previously developed methods do not detect differential modification patterns in a pattern discovery process .

we evaluated whether the pattern explained variation in gene expression and functions. some existing methods require a prior knowledge, e.g. the use of motif seeds to initialise the subsequence of the pattern , local prior knowledge for initial state definition of emission and transitions probabilities , and corresponding genome annotation for regions around, for example, the tss, exons, utr <dig> and utr <dig>  and gc rich regions.

the patterns we discovered have flexibility in the representation of chromatin signatures. the pattern is capable of identifying differential combination patterns and can include multiple modes  <cit>  of the constituent modifications. for example, our method can be used to identify the co-localised epigenetic modifications for which differential changes are likely conserved in specific functional elements in different genomic space. the equal frequency binning strategy used in charm to transform continuous values into categorical bins also gives flexibility and simplicity to find the pattern reflecting an epigenetic modification distribution of each mark.

while charm has several strengths, it also has some limitations. for example, it does not distinctively distinguish the different shapes of patterns that are composed of the same constituent modifications. however, it provides informative relationships among the constituent modifications, which may not correspond to physical biochemical interactions but are more likely to imply cross-talk between different epigenetic modifications. thus, our approach is scalable in respect of deriving functionally associated patterns by incorporating epigenetic modifications with other genomic features  in a learning model. in future studies, we could take advantage of this, and of charm’s other qualities, to infer functionally important epigenetic modification patterns.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed charm, an unsupervised approach that uses arm, a well-known method for finding frequent patterns in large databases, for the discovery and interpretation of de novo combinatorial epigenetic modification patterns that occur globally in a cancer cell line. consequently, charm identified combinatorial chromatin patterns of differentially modified regions in an unbiased fashion without using any functional annotations . additionally, it was able to characterise the functional elements and genome features that are enriched in the patterns.

the patterns are expressed as association rules, which are quantitative, informative, and easily interpreted. biologists could determine interesting rules or differential patterns between different cell types more easily than with some existing methods.
