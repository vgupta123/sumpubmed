BACKGROUND
emmer wheat  is an allotetraploid species, which harbors of two different genomes , and is distributed over the near east fertile crescent  <cit> . emmer wheat is the wild progenitor of emmer , from which all t. turgidum ssp. durum  and t. aestivum  were derived. while crop yields have recently increased for the most part, the genetic basis of most of the important food crops has been rapidly narrowing  <cit> . this is due to the global extension of modern pure breeding practices, which increase genetic homogeneity  <cit> . the loss of genetic diversity of some of the world’s crops has accelerated greatly in recent decades, with many crops becoming increasingly susceptible to diseases, pests and environmental stresses. wild cereals are widely adaptive to all these stressful factors. this explains why wild relatives of cultivated wheat, and in particular wild emmer wheat, t. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides , have been of great interest to crop researchers and the subject of extensive research in the past few decades.

previous works investigating the genetic structure and differentiation of wild emmer wheat suggest that genetic diversity is eco-geographically structured and might be partly determined by climatic and edaphic factors . a previous study on emmer wheat populations in micro-geographic sites in israel, using allozymes and random amplified polymorphic dna  markers, showed a possible nonrandom adaptive genetic differentiation at single and multilocus levels in contrasting soils, topographies, and climate  <cit> . discriminate analyses using allozyme markers differentiated between one central and three marginal regions, as well as between different soil-types within the populations in israel  <cit> . in addition, a strong ssr diversity was found among three populations and two edaphic  groups of t. dicoccoides  <cit> . it was suggested that ssr variation is influenced by both genetic factors and ecological forces  <cit> . although much genetic research had been conducted over the years, none of the studies attempted to explain the phenotypic polymorphism by examining epigenetic factors, such as cytosine methylation. the observed genetic variation between and within wild emmer wheat populations was significantly higher than the reported genetic variation in cultivated wheat  <cit> . while the observed genetic variation  in most cases might be neutral, namely it might not impact genomic function, epigenetic variation could have a direct impact on genome function, and through this might affect the fitness of an organism to specific environmental conditions.

epigenetic regulation is the heritable alteration of the extent of gene products by modifications other than in the dna sequence. it consists mostly of 5-cytosine methylation at cg and chg sites  <cit> . as a general rule, hypermethylation is correlated with down-regulation of gene expression, while hypomethylation is correlated with up-regulation of gene expression  <cit> . the bias of methylation toward repetitive dna suggests that silencing transposable elements  is one of the primary roles of dna methylation  <cit> . the arabidopsis genome contains 24 % methylated cg sites,  <dig>  % methylated chg sites  and  <dig>  % methylated chh sites  <cit> . all transposable element sequences are usually methylated in arabidopsis, in all sequence contexts  <cit> . considering that dna demethylation or methylation of transposable element sequences is associated with their activation or silencing, respectively, tes are hypermethylated compared to host genes in plants . thus, there is an increased interest in understanding the role of epigenetic processes in ecology and evolution. however, almost nothing is known on the structure and extent of methylation-based epigenetic variation in wild plant populations in general, and in wheat populations in particular. using the methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism  assay  <cit> , two studies reported on the structure and amount of methylation variation at ccgg sites in wild populations of barley  <cit>  and viola cazorlensis  <cit> . to date, there are no reports on extensive studies on the structure and amount of epigenetic variation in natural populations of wild emmer wheat.

in this study we aimed to assess the epigenetic biodiversity, through cytosine methylation, within and between populations of wild emmer wheat using accessions collected from five geographically isolated regions with different climatic conditions such as: rainfall level, humidity, soil type and biotic conditions  <cit> . more specifically, we have assessed:  the structure and amount of cytosine methylation variation at ccgg sites in a genome-wide manner, using msap assay; and  the structure and amount of cytosine methylation variation at ccgg sites flanking transposable elements, using the tmd assay  <cit> . to this end, we observed statistically significant population-unique heritable methylation patterns. the possible adaptive value of the observed epigenetic variations in wild emmer wheat is discussed.

RESULTS
genome-wide analysis of dna cytosine methylation of ccgg sites
it is known that methylation patterns in plants can be inherited over generations  <cit> . this heritable epigenetic variation might have an evolutionary role in adaptation and divergence of natural populations. in order to reduce temporal methylation variations among accessions in the different populations we have synchronized the growth of all plants collected from the five populations in the same greenhouse . figure  <dig> describes the location of the five collection sites  and the ecogeographical data  of all five collection sites are described in additional file 1: table s <dig>  dna was extracted from young leaves  from all accessions and was subjected to msap analysis. the analysis is based on the cleavage patterns of two enzymes, hpaii and mspi, which both cleave unmethylated ccgg sites. mspi  cleaves when the internal cytosine is methylated , while hpaii  cleaves when the external cytosine is methylated  only when the methylation occurs in one strand   <cit> . the level of methylation for each individual can be measured by the number of sites with polymorphic bands between the mspi and hpaii msap reactions in the same individual out of the total number of msap sites. examples of radioactively-labeled and fluorescently-labeled msap patterns are shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  to this end,  <dig> reproducible msap sites were analyzed in all  <dig> accessions. it is important to mention that the accessions which showed low quality msap patterns were excluded from the analysis and that polymorphic bands which could correspond to typical aflp variation  were excluded from the analysis. namely, for each site, only variation which had originated from cytosine methylation  was considered.fig.  <dig> a map of israel and the surrounding areas of the west bank, gaza strip and parts of jordan, lebanon and syria. the five collection sites  of wild emmer wheat are indicated in green. this map was created in google earth. see additional file 1: table s <dig> for more details on the ecogeographical nature of the collection sites



the average level of methylation was measured in all five populations and found to be statistically similar :  <dig>  % in mt. hermon,  <dig>  % in amiad,  <dig>  % in tabgha, 65 % in jaba and  <dig>  % in mt. amasa. however, for four populations , the context of methylation in a majority of the sites  occurred in chg positions , while for the mt. amasa population, the level of chg methylation was similar to the level of cg methylation. similarly, the methylation levels in the genome of the three t. dicoccoides accessions from turkey, iran and syria were  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and 62 %, respectively. note that we cannot conclude that the methylation level in the turkish t. dicoccoides is significantly higher because only one accession was tested.

a phylogenetic tree was built based on the methylation patterns of the  <dig> ccgg sites from msap, for  <dig> accessions . the phylogenetic tree significantly clustered the accessions  based on their geographical origin . in fig.  <dig> it can be seen that accessions from mt. hermon were significantly clustered in one group based on their methylation patterns, and so were jaba, mt. amasa and tabgha accessions . the amiad accessions were clustered in two main groups, the first group contained  <dig> accessions, while the second group, which is similar to the tabgha cluster, contained three accessions. this might indicate a high level of epigenetic variation in the amiad population. one explanation is that the collection from the amiad site was from a relatively large area and it was previously reported on the wide variation within this population  <cit> . the t. dicoccoides accessions from turkey and iran were significantly clustered in one group based on their chg methylation status. interestingly, the syrian accession was similar to the mt. hermon cluster, which is geographically closer.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree generated by multi-dimensional scaling using  <dig> msap bands from accessions of five populations: mt. hermon, amiad, tabgha, jaba and mt. amasa. accessions ttd <dig>  ttd <dig> and ttd <dig> were collected from syria, iran and turkey, respectively, and were used as outsider controls in this analysis. the index  indicates the collection site of each one of the  <dig> accessions. nch, at the bottom of the phylogenetic tree indicates a negative control . the black lines indicate significant separation, while red lines indicate insignificant separation. the level of epigenetic similarity is indicated on bottom. see additional file 2: figure s <dig> for more details on the statistical analysis



we have randomly extracted  <dig> bands from radioactively-labeled msap , reamplified and sequenced them . all sequences were used as queries in plant sequence databases  and  <dig> out of the  <dig> sequences hit transposable elements, while the remaining  <dig> sequences did not hit annotated genes or non-coding sequences. transposable elements are considered key players in organismal evolution because they play a prominent role in genomic rearrangements  <cit> . here we have assessed the contribution of two transposable element families, veju  and thalos  to the methylation-based epigenetic variation in wild emmer wheat populations.

analysis of the methylation patterns of ccgg sites flanking veju elements
it is known that in plants, tes are often targeted for methylation, as such they are said to be hypermethylated compared to other genomic sequences  <cit> . recently, it was observed that the methylation surrounding tes was significantly higher than the methylation of random genomic sequences  <cit> . to this end, the level of methylation in veju-flanking ccgg sites was measured for each one of the accessions and then the average methylation level was calculated for each population . it is important to mention that polymorphic bands among accessions that could be the result of a transposition event and did not show any methylation changes  were excluded from the analysis. however, some of the polymorphic sites that showed methylation changes could be the results of polymorphism in the te insertion sites.

based on the analysis of  <dig> tmd bands, the average level of methylation of ccgg sites flanking veju was:  <dig>  % in mt. hermon,  <dig>  % in amiad,  <dig>  % in tabgha,  <dig>  % in jaba and  <dig>  % in mt. amasa. the average methylation levels among populations were statistically similar . in addition, the methylation levels in the genome of the t. dicoccoides accessions from turkey and iran were  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  %, respectively.

the resulting phylogenetic tree significantly clustered the accessions  based on their geographical origin . accessions from mt. amasa were significantly clustered in one group based on their methylation patterns, as were mt. hermon, tabgha and jaba accessions , while accessions from amiad were clustered in two main groups, the first group contained  <dig> accessions, while the second group  was clustered close to the tabgha population. furthermore, the t. dicoccoides accessions from turkey and iran were clustered in one group, while the syrian accession was clustered in the mt. hermon group.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree generated by multi-dimensional scaling using  <dig> tmd bands corresponding to veju-ccgg flanking sites, from accessions of five populations . nch, at the bottom of the phylogenetic tree indicates a negative control . the black lines indicate significant separation, while red lines indicate insignificant separation. the level of epigenetic similarity is indicated on bottom. see additional file 2: figure s <dig> for more details on the statistical analysis



analysis of the methylation patterns of ccgg sites flanking thalos elements
based on the analysis of  <dig> tmd bands, the average level of methylation of ccgg sites flanking thalos was statistically similar among populations :  <dig>  % in mt. hermon,  <dig>  % in amiad,  <dig>  % in tabgha, 51 % in jaba and  <dig>  % in mt. amasa. furthermore, the methylation levels in the genome of the t. dicoccoides accessions from iran and syria were  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively. the phylogenetic tree significantly clustered the accessions  based on their geographical origin . accessions from mt. hermon were significantly clustered in one group based on their methylation patterns, as were jaba, mt. amasa and tabgha accessions . in addition, amiad accessions were significantly clustered in one main group containing  <dig> out of the  <dig> accessions . furthermore, the t. dicoccoides accessions from turkey, iran and syria were clustered in one group based on their methylation patterns.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree generated by multi-dimensional scaling using  <dig> tmd bands corresponding to thalos-ccgg flanking sites from accessions of five populations . ncm indicates a negative control. the black lines indicate significant separation, while red lines indicate insignificant separation. the level of epigenetic similarity is indicated on bottom. see additional file 2: figure s <dig> for more details on the statistical analysis



discussion
in this study, we have performed genome-wide analyses of cytosine methylation of ccgg sites in the genomes of wild emmer wheat accessions collected from five geographically isolated regions. more specifically, we performed an analysis of random and te-flanking ccgg sites. we found that variations in the cytosine methylation are relatively high and observed population-specific epigenetic patterns based on geographical region.

we have analyzed the methylation status of  <dig> ccgg sites in the genome of  <dig> accessions of wild emmer wheat from five geographically isolated populations, using an unbiased assay – msap. we observed that  <dig> – <dig>  % of those ccgg sites were methylated in all accessions, indicating a relatively high fraction of heritable methylation patterns in wild emmer compared to domesticated t. turgidum species . when the methylation patterns were compared among the  <dig> accessions, most of the accessions were significantly clustered based on their geographical location, suggesting that accessions in each population might have adapted unique patterns of inherited cytosine methylation. another possibility is that the population-specific methylation patterns might have been the result of a founder effect in each population. however, in some cases, accessions from one population were similar in their methylation patters to accessions from other populations. similarly, and using the same methodology as in our study, population-specific methylation patterns were observed in wild populations of v. cazorlensis  <cit> . importantly, in our study the methylation patterns were assessed in the second generation under common garden conditions , and the results were very similar to those observed in the first generation, indicating that the observed population-specific methylation patterns were inherited. it is important to mention that the use of common garden conditions allows us to ensure not only the assessment of the heritable methylation patterns, but also the accuracy of the statistical analysis that were performed on the methylation data, although in some cases the common garden conditions would be different from the natural conditions for some populations. hence, a common garden might in fact cause minor epigenetic changes, but this should not affect the veracity of the conclusion since the common garden conditions are not stressful to any of the populations. the key question is whether this epigenetic differentiation of populations is associated with adaptive genetic divergence, because unlike the natural dna sequence variation-based markers, methylation-based variation might affect genome function by altering gene expression. in order to have some hint about the type of sequences that might be targeted for methylation, we have randomly sequenced and annotated  <dig> msap bands that showed methylation alteration among accessions in different populations and found that most of them  corresponded to transposable elements, indicating that tes are massively targeted for methylation and might be differentially affected by epigenetic factors in different populations .

epigenetic variation adjacent to transposons
here we have analyzed the methylation status adjacent to two te families: veju  and thalos , using the tmd assay. the analysis included a random subset of veju and thalos insertions . although there are no reports on the exact copy number of either veju or thalos families in emmer wheat, our estimation is that they include hundreds to thousands of copies in the wheat genome . similar to the msap results, tmd showed that the methylation levels of ccgg sites flanking the two te families in wild t. turgidum  seem to be higher than the methylation levels in domesticated t. turgidum . the average methylation level of ccgg sites flanking veju in wild emmer wheat is ~50 %, while the average methylation level in domesticated durum is ~40 %  <cit> . the average methylation level of ccgg sites flanking thalos in wild emmer wheat is ~54 %, while the average methylation level in domesticated durum is ~36 %  <cit> . a previous study in plants showed that in model plant systems, the methylation levels of transposons are significantly higher than the methylation levels of other genomic regions  <cit> . this observation was corroborated when we assessed the methylation levels in domesticated wheat species  <cit> . however, in this study we observed that the methylation levels in genomic regions were even higher than the methylation status around tes, indicating that epigenetic factors might play a major role not only in regulating te activity, but also in regulating other functional sequences in natural populations. furthermore, we observed population-specific methylation patterns of ccgg sites around veju and thalos, indicating that the epigenetic regulation of tes might be specific to local environmental conditions. the population-specific patterns were also observed in the second generation under common garden conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we used msap and tmd techniques to assess the structure and extent of methylation-based epigenetic variation in natural populations of wild emmer wheat. we observed a relatively high level of heritable methylation at cg and chg sites in wild emmer wheat. note that similar phylogenetic trees were observed when cg or chg sites were analyzed separately. on average, over 50 % of the tested ccgg sites  were constantly methylated over two generations under common garden conditions. this observed level of methylation is underestimated because both assays detect methylation only when one of the two cytosines at a ccgg site is methylated, whereas if both cytosines are methylated, both enzymes will not cleave the site and discrimination between methylation and typical genetic polymorphisms is difficult. this study provides hints on the important role of dna methylation and transposable elements on adaptive genetic divergence in wild emmer wheat populations. future studies will allow assessment of the potential of population-specific methylation patterns to differentially affect gene function under varying environmental conditions.
