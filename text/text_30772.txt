BACKGROUND
fatty acid biosynthesis is essential for the survival of mammals, plants, fungi and bacteria  <cit> . using acetyl-coa and malonyl-coa as the initiating substrate and building block, respectively, these organisms share a common set of biochemical reactions to extend fatty acyl chains by two carbon atoms per cycle . in most bacteria and plants, fatty acids are synthesized by a discrete and highly conserved group of enzymes designated the type ii or dissociated fatty acid synthase  system . as a key feature of the fas ii system, the hydrophobic fatty acyl intermediates are shuttled from enzyme to enzyme by a small, highly acidic acyl carrier protein   <cit> . to date, the fas ii system has been most extensively studied in the escherichia coli model system, in which all the enzymes required for fatty acid synthesis have been identified and characterized biochemically .

the genes encoding fatty acid synthetic enzymes are highly conserved in bacteria, and in many cases, their genomic arrangement is also conserved  <cit> . although the basic steps in the fatty acid synthesis cycle are common to all bacteria  <cit> , abundant exceptions to the e. coli paradigm are present in other bacteria  <cit> . in general, a discrete enzyme encoded by a single chromosomal locus catalyzes each step of the elongation pathway. however, although some bacteria encode isozymes, in most cases these enzymes have differing specificities  <cit> . one example is enterococcus faecalis, which encodes two homologues each of fabz and fabf. however, this bacterium uses one of the fabz homologues  and one of the fabf homologues  to perform the unsaturated fatty acid synthetic functions performed by e. coli faba and fabb  <cit> .

another example is the enzyme enoyl-acp reductase, which catalyzes the nad  h-dependent reduction of the enoyl-acp double bond in the last step of the elongation cycle  <cit> . several bacteria have two enoyl-acp reductases that can be either of the same or of different protein families . in some cases one of the enzymes is responsible for supporting a fatty acid synthetic rate that allows wild type growth. the rationale for this duplication of enzyme activity is unknown, but the two enzymes of a given bacterium often differ in their inhibition by triclosan, a man-made biocide .

in the bacterial fatty acid synthesis pathways studied to date, only a single enzyme, fabg, has been found to catalyze the reduction of 3-ketoacyl-acps to 3-hydroxy acyl-acps  <cit>  . fabg proteins are particularly difficult to annotate because they are members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase  protein superfamily, which constitutes one of the largest protein superfamilies, with many bacterial members  <cit>  . hence, annotation of a gene as encoding a 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase is much more likely to be accurate if the gene is located within a cluster of genes that are good candidates for having roles in fatty acid synthesis. that said, our prior work showed that only one of the two lactococcus lactis annotated fabg genes was involved in fatty acid synthesis, although both genes had plausible genome contexts  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase  reaction, alignment of r. solanacearum fabg <dig> and fabg <dig> with e. coli fabg and organization of the r. solanacearum fatty acid biosynthesis gene clusters. panel a, the kar reaction. panel b, alignments of r. solanacearum fabg <dig> and fabg <dig> with e. coli fabg. rs and ec denote r. solanacearum and e. coli, respectively. the cofactor binding sequence  is boxed. the two arginine residues thought to bind the acp moiety are highlighted by arrows and the catalytic triad residues are highlighted by asterisks. the alignment was done with clustal w based on identical residues. panel c, organization of the r. solanacearum fatty acid biosynthesis gene clusters. the thick arrows indicate the relative sizes of the genes. the numbers above the arrows indicate the gene designations in the r. solanacearum of comprehensive microbial resource  database, and the gene names below the arrows indicate the e. coli genes that correspond to the open reading frames in the r. solanacearum cluster. hsp indicates hypothetical signal peptide protein. chp indicates conserved hypothetical protein. kas indicates putative 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase



we report the first example of a bacterium that encodes two functional fabg homologues. this bacterium is ralstonia solanacearum, a soil-borne, destructive plant pathogen that has a global distribution and an unusually wide host range  <cit> . functional characterization of the two proteins shows that they both are active in fatty acid synthesis but play different roles in determining the cellular fatty acid profile, the response to environmental stress, and pathogenesis.

RESULTS
two r. solanacearum genes annotated as fabg homologues
two r. solanacearum genes, called fabg <dig> and fabg <dig> , were annotated as encoding homologues of e. coli fabg, the essential 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase  <cit> . the rsfabg <dig> gene  is located in a chromosomal cluster of putative fatty acid synthesis genes , based on alignments of their gene products with the e. coli proteins, whereas the rsfabg <dig> gene  lies within a second putative fatty acid synthesis gene cluster  located on the megaplasmid . sequence alignments indicated that rsfabg <dig> and rsfabg <dig> are 65 % and 43 % identical to e. coli fabg, respectively, and showed that the catalytically active short chain dehydrogenase/reductase  family triad  and the n-terminal cofactor binding sequence  defined by the x-ray crystal structures of e. coli fabg  <cit>  are present in both r. solanacearum proteins . moreover, two e. coli fabg residues, arg- <dig> and arg- <dig>  reported to play critical roles in facilitating the binding of the acp moiety of the substrate  <cit> , are conserved in rsfabg <dig> and rsfabg <dig> . based on these criteria, it seemed reasonable to hypothesize that rsfabg <dig> and rsfabg <dig> both encode functional 3-ketoacyl-acp reductases and that both play important roles in fatty acid synthesis and growth in r. solanacearum.

complementation of an e. coli fabg temperature-sensitive mutant with the rsfabg genes
e. coli strain cl <dig> is a fabg temperature-sensitive mutant  <cit>  that lacks 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase activity at 42 °c and is unable to grow at this non-permissive temperature. to test the functionality of rsfabg <dig> and rsfabg <dig> in vivo, each of the genes was inserted into the arabinose-inducible vector pbad24m  <cit>  to give the expression constructs pyj <dig>  and pyj <dig> . the plasmids were transferred into strain cl <dig> at the permissive temperature and the resulting transformants were tested for their growth at the non-permissive temperature. strain cl <dig> carrying plasmid pyj <dig> grew at 42 °c even in the absence of arabinose . in contrast, the pyj4-containing strain grew at 42 °c in the presence of arabinose but failed to grow in the absence of arabinose. therefore, both of the rsfabg candidates could complement the e. coli fabg strain, indicating that each protein catalyzes 3-ketoacyl-acp reduction. however, it appears likely that rsfabg <dig> is less active than rsfabg <dig> because high-level induction by arabinose was required for robust growth.fig.  <dig> growth of transformants of e. coli fabg mutant strain cl <dig> with plasmids carrying the r. solanacearum fabgs. e. coli strain cl <dig>  carrying the pbad24m-derived plasmids pyj <dig>  and pyj <dig> , was grown at 42 °c. ara, abbreviation of arabinose



expression and purification of the r. solanacearum fabgs
to perform a direct in vitro assay of fabg activity, recombinant n-terminal hexahistidine-tagged rsfabgs were produced. these proteins were purified by nickel chelate chromatography to obtain preparations that gave single bands on sds-gel electrophoresis . the purified rsfabg <dig> and rsfabg <dig> proteins have monomeric molecular weights of 29 kda and 30 kda, respectively. given that e. coli fabg is a homo-tetramer  <cit> , we estimated the solution structures of rsfabg <dig> and rsfabg <dig> by gel filtration chromatography . the rsfabg <dig> and rsfabg <dig> elution profiles showed that both fabgs, like e. coli fabg, exist as homo-tetramers in solution.fig.  <dig> purification of r. solanacearum fabgs from e. coli strain bl <dig>  and circular dichroism spectra of r. solanacearum fabg <dig> and fabg <dig>  panel a, purification of r. solanacearum gmi <dig> fabg <dig> and fabg <dig> by native nickel-chelate chromatography. lane  <dig>  molecular mass markers; lane  <dig>  r. solanacearum fabg <dig> protein; lane  <dig>  r. solanacearum fabg <dig> protein. panel b, size exclusion chromatography of the hexahistidine-tagged wild type rsfabg <dig> and fabg <dig> protein. the elution peaks of the molecular weight standards are given at the top of the panel. panel c, cd spectra of r. solanacearum fabgs. cd spectra were measured at 25 °c. open circles, e. coli fabg; filled triangle, r. solanacearum fabg1; open squares, r. solanacearum fabg2



to elucidate the secondary structure and folding properties of the fabg protein, circular dichroism  spectroscopy analyses were used . the cd spectrum of r. solanacearum fabg <dig>  like that of e. coli fabg, had the characteristic helix signature with minima at  <dig> and 222 nm, whereas fabg <dig> showed only a single helix signature minimum at 222 nm. moreover, the helical content of rsfabg <dig>  was considerably lower than that of ecfabg , whereas the helical content of the rsfabg <dig>  was much closer to that of ecfabg. these data indicated that, although both rsfabg <dig> and rsfabg <dig> are homo-tetramers in solution, they seem likely to have different folding patterns.

in vitro enzymatic activities of rsfabg <dig> and rsfabg2
the function of the two rsfabgs in fatty acid synthesis was assayed in vitro. first, the enzymatic activity of rsfabgs in the initial steps of fatty acid synthesis was tested as described in the methods. in the absence of a 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase, only holo-acp was seen , probably due to hydrolysis of the labile 3-ketobutyryl-acp during electrophoresis  <cit> . addition of rsfabg <dig>  rsfabg <dig> or ecfabg to the reaction mixture resulted in production of butyryl-acp . upon addition of the long-chain e. coli 3-ketoacyl-acp synthase, ecfabb, to the reactions, all reactions produced long-chain acyl-acp species . these data clearly showed that, like e. coli fabg, both rsfabg <dig> and rsfabg <dig> could complete the initial cycle of fatty acid synthesis to produce butyryl-acp.fig.  <dig> function of r. solanacearum fabg <dig> and fabg <dig> in fatty acid synthesis reactions. panel a, function of r. solanacearum fabg <dig> and fabg <dig> in the initial cycle of fatty acid synthesis. the initial cycle of fatty acid synthesis was reconstructed in vitro using a combination of e. coli fabh , kar  , or r. solanacearum fabg <dig>   and fabg <dig>  , e. coli fabz  and fabi  enzymes, acp, nadh, and nadph as cofactors and malonyl-acp plus acetyl-coa as substrates to produce butyryl-acp. to complete the fatty acid synthesis reaction , e. coli fabb  was added to the reactions . panel b and c, function of r. solanacearum fabg <dig> and fabg <dig> in the fatty acid elongation cycle. the elongation reaction mixture contained e. coli fabb , kar e. coli fabg   or r. solanacearum fabg <dig>  , fabg <dig>   and e. coli fabz , malonyl-acp plus octanoyl-acp  or tetradecanoyl-acp  as substrates, and nadh and nadph as cofactors. rsg <dig> and rsg <dig> denote r. solanacearum fabg <dig> and fabg <dig>  respectively. lane  <dig> is the product of octanoyl-acp and lane  <dig> is the product of tetradecanoyl-acp. lane  <dig> is the product of 3-hydroxydecanoyl-acp treated with e. coli fabz and lane  <dig> is the product of 3-hydroxyhexadecanoyl-acp treated with e. coli fabz



next, the enzymatic activity of the two rsfabgs in the reduction of long-chain 3-ketoacyl-acp substrates was also examined. incubation of ecfabb with malonyl-acp and octanoyl-acp or tetradecanoyl-acp resulted in the formation of 3-ketodecanoyl-acp  or 3-ketohexadecanoyl-acp , respectively . upon the addition of nadph, a 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase  and ecfabz to the reaction mixture all incubations produced 3-hydroxyacyl-and enoyl-acp species . note that ecfabg converts 3-ketoacyl-acps to 3-hydroxacyl-acps, whereas e. coli fabz dehydrates 3-hydroxacyl-acps to produce enoyl-acps. therefore, these data indicate that both rsfabgs are active with long-chain 3-ketoacyl-acp substrates, consistent with their ability to support the growth of e. coli.

acetoacetyl-coa is the substrate most often used to test 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase activity   <cit> . thus, the kinetic properties of rsfabgs  were examined using the model substrate acetoacetyl-coa as substrate. rsfabg <dig> reduced acetoacetyl-coa, although with a lower enzyme activity than e. coli fabg, whereas rsfabg <dig> failed to reduce the model substrate . the maximal velocities of acetoacetyl-coa reduction of rsfabg <dig> or ecfabg were strikingly different, as were the km values of rsfabg <dig> and ecfabg. the maximal velocity of rsfabg <dig> for the nadph substrate was lower than that of ecfabg, and the km of rsfabg1was higher than that of ecfabg .table  <dig> kinetic parameters of r. solanacearum fabg proteins

essentiality of the r. solanacearum rsfabg <dig> gene
to examine whether the two 3-ketoacyl-acp reductases are essential for r. solanacearum cell growth and cellular fatty acid synthesis we attempted disruption of both genes. plasmids containing pk18mobsacb-borne gm resistance cassette insertions in rsfabg <dig>  or rsfabg <dig>  were constructed. plasmids  carrying the gene disruptions were introduced into the genome of wild type r. solanacearum strain gmi <dig> via conjugal transfer from e. coli s17- <dig>  mutant colonies were subsequently screened on a medium containing sucrose and gentamicin. the success of the mutants was assayed by colony pcr analysis using two primer pairs listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  during our attempts to generate an rsfabg1-disrupted r. solanacearum strain, only single crossover integrants were obtained . this result suggested that rsfabg <dig> is an essential r. solanacearum gene.

to test this hypothesis we constructed plasmid pyj <dig>  which carries rsfabg <dig> under the control of the e. coli lac promoter, and transformed this plasmid into an rsfabg <dig> single crossover integrant stain . the transformants were then plated on medium containing gentamicin, sucrose and iptg to select for loss of sacb function. colony pcr assays using the primer pair rsfabg <dig> upside and rsfabg <dig> downside showed that one of the surviving colonies, named strain rs-g <dig> , in which rsfabg <dig> was replaced by the gentamicin resistance gene, contained the defined  <dig>  kb gm resistance-containing fragment. as expected, a  <dig>  kb rsfabg1-containing fragment was amplified from the wild type strain using the same primer pair . using primer pair rsfabg1ck <dig> and rsfabg1ck <dig>  colony pcr amplified a  <dig>  kb rsfabg1-containing fragment from both the wild type and rs-g <dig>  strains because rs-g <dig>  contains the plasmid-borne pyj <dig> copy of rsfabg <dig> . insertion of the gm cassette plus deletion of rsfabg <dig> sequences was also confirmed by sequencing of the pcr fragment of the disruption allele.

moreover, we constructed pyj <dig>  a pk18mobsacb-borne plasmid containing e. coli fabg plus a downstream gm resistance cassette. plasmid pyj <dig> was transformed into the wild type strain gmi <dig> and the transformants were processed through the counter-selection protocol described above . this gave strain rs-g <dig>  in which rsfabg <dig> had been replaced by e. coli fabg as shown by colony pcr analysis  with same primer pairs as used above .

next, the strains lacking a functional chromosomal copy of rsfabg <dig>  including rs-g <dig>  and rs-g <dig> , were tested for growth in m <dig> medium at 30 °c. under iptg induction, strain rs-g <dig>  grew in m <dig> medium, although it had a generation time of 256 ± 10 min which is appreciably longer than that of the wild type r. solanacearum strain gmi <dig> , but rs-g <dig>  failed to grow without iptg induction. however, the e. coli fabg substitution strain rs-g <dig> , which had a generation time of 157 ± 4 min, grew as well as the wild type strain. collectively, these data demonstrated that rsfabg <dig> is an essential gene in r. solanacearum and that its function can be replaced by the e. coli fabg gene.

as assayed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry , though both mutants contained the same fatty acid species as the wild type strain on m <dig> medium plates, the two mutant strains all produced more unsaturated fatty acids  and fewer 3-hydroxy fatty acids  than the wild type strain gmi <dig> . the ratios of ufas to sfas in strains rs-g <dig> , and rs-g <dig>  were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, much higher than that of the wild type strain . in addition, the ratios of 3-hydroxy fatty acids to non-hydroxyl fatty acids in these strains were  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively, lower than that of the wild type strain .table  <dig> fatty acid composition of total lipid extracts from r. solanacearum fabg mutant strains grown on m <dig> medium plates a

effects of rsfabg <dig> mutation on growth of r. solanacearum
using a similar approach, we readily obtained a rsfabg <dig> gm insertion mutant ) . the growth of rs-g <dig>  in m <dig> medium was tested. in m <dig> medium at 30 °c, rs-g <dig>  had a generation time of 170 ± 5 min, somewhat longer than that of the wild type strain , indicating that rsfabg <dig> was not essential for r. solanacearum growth.

the gc-ms assays showed that strain rs-g <dig>  also contained significantly more ufas and fewer 3-hfas than the wild type strain  was  <dig> ; the hfa/fa ratio was  <dig> ) . however, in the rs-g <dig> strain the major increase in ufas was in c18: <dig> species, whereas both c16: <dig> and c18: <dig> species of ufa were increased in rsfabg <dig> mutant strains . this suggested that, like rsfabg <dig>  rsfabg <dig> plays a role in determining the cellular fatty acid profile of r. solanacearum and that some changes in 3-ketoacyl-acp reductases affect the fatty acid composition of r. solanacearum.

in order to investigate possible physiological functions of rsfabg <dig>  we also tested the growth of strain rs-g <dig>  in bg medium under various environmental challenges . although the growth of strain rs-g <dig>  was similar to that of the wild type strain at different temperatures , high salt concentration  or low ph  differentially affected the growth of strain rs-g <dig>  . note that under natural conditions  all strains grew well . under these conditions, rs-g <dig>  grew more slowly than the wild strain gmi <dig> . complementation of rs-g <dig>  with plasmid pyj <dig>  which carries wild type rsfabg <dig>  restored the growth of rs-g <dig>  . these results indicated that, although rsfabg <dig> is not an essential gene in r. solanacearum, it does play a role in the adaptation of r. solanacearum to environmental stress. to test whether the expression of rsfabg <dig> is controlled by environmental stress, the transcript level of rsfabg <dig> and rsfabg <dig> was examined under high salt concentration and low ph by quantitative rt-pcr . the level of expression of rsfabg <dig> was 6- to 7-fold greater than that of rsfabg <dig> under all conditions, and the level of expression of rsfabg <dig> under high salt concentration or low ph was almost same as that under natural conditions . these data indicate that the expression of rsfabg <dig> and rsfabg <dig> seems to be constitutive. we also complemented rs-g <dig>  with plasmid pyj <dig>  which carries e. coli wild type ecfabg. this strain grew as well as strain gmi <dig> under these conditions . therefore, we speculate that it is the level of activity of 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase rather than the rsfabg <dig> gene or protein product that is important for the response of r. solanacearum to stress. this was also observed in the pathogenesis experiments described below.fig.  <dig> growth of the r. solanacearum fabg <dig> mutant strain in bg medium under high salt or low ph conditions. panel a, the growth of mutant strain rs-g <dig> in bg medium under natural conditions . panel b, the growth of rs-g <dig> in bg medium containing  <dig>  m nacl at 30°c. panel c, the growth of rs-g <dig> in bg medium with ph adjusted to  <dig>  by  <dig> n hcl at 30°c. filled circle denotes rs-g <dig> strain, empty triangle denotes rs-g2/pyj <dig> strain, filled triangle denotes rs-g2/pyj <dig> strain and empty circle denotes gmi <dig> strain. panel d, expression of rsfabg <dig> and rsfabg <dig> under hight salt or low ph conditions. open bar denotes rsfabg <dig> and filled black bar denotes rsfabg <dig>  



mutation of rsfabg <dig> impaired the virulence of r. solanacearum in tomato plants
r. solanacearum is a phytopathogenic bacterium that causes vascular wilt diseases in many plants  <cit> . to investigate the role of rsfabg <dig> in the virulence of r. solanacearum, tomato plants were inoculated with the wild type gmi <dig> and the rs-g <dig>  strain. the wild type gmi <dig> strain caused symptoms of wilt on the 3rd day after inoculation and the test tomato plants showed complete wilting by 7 days after infection, whereas the rs-g <dig>  strain caused no disease symptoms until 21 days after inoculation . furthermore, both rsfabg <dig> and ecfabg caused some tomato plant wilting and hence partially restored the virulence of the rs-g <dig>  strain; restoration of ecfabg was more effective than that of rsfabg <dig>  the mortality rates of tomato plants infected by these strains throughout the course of the infection were: gmi <dig>  100 %; rs-g <dig> , 0 %; rs-g2/pyj <dig>  40 % and rs-g2/pyj <dig>  65 %.fig.  <dig> effects of rsfabg <dig> on virulence of r. solanacearum. panel a, pathogenicity test on tomato plants with the r. solanacearum gmi <dig> or rs-g <dig> mutant strain. panel b, biofilm formation of strain rs-g <dig>  panel c, swimming motility of the rs-g <dig> strain



we also evaluated several pathogenicity-related phenotypes of strain rs-g <dig> . the production of eps i , egl , and pgl  by rs-g <dig>  was first tested. the data showed that production of eps i, egl, and pgl was not significantly impaired in the mutated strain rs-g <dig>  . next, the biofilm formation and swimming motility of strain rs-g <dig>  were examined. after r. solanacearum strains had been incubated without shaking in bg broth at 28 °c for 36 h, the biofilms formed on the slides were quantified. it was found that rs-g <dig>  produced less biofilm  than the wild type strain gmi <dig>  . the swimming motility of rs-g <dig>  was evaluated on semi-solid motility agar. after 2 days at 28 °c, the rs-g <dig>  swimming haloes were about half as large as those formed by gmi <dig>  when complemented with ecfabg, the motility of the rs-g <dig>  strain was restored to that of the wild type, whereas strain rs-g <dig>  complemented with rsfabg <dig> formed the same small halo as rs-g <dig>  . in order to explain why complementation of rs-g <dig>  with rsfabg <dig> failed to restore swimming motility, the 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase activities were tested in cell-free extracts of these strains. although the 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase activity  in strain rs-g <dig> carrying the rsfabg <dig> encoded plasmid  was higher than that in strain rs-g <dig> , it was still lower than that in strain rs-g2/pyj <dig>  or the wild type strain . these results indicate that the level of activity of 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase is important for the lifestyle of r. solanacearum and that mutation of rsfabg <dig> can impair biofilm formation and decrease swimming motility.

to address the above observations further, we examined the expression of the genes related to r. solanacearum virulence determinants, including epsa, egl, pehb, pgla, flic, flim, pilq, pilt and t3ss-related genes , in the rs-g <dig> mutant by quantitative rt-pcr. the expression of flim, hrpy, and hrpx was obviously decreased in the rs-g <dig>  mutant compared with the wild type strain gmi <dig>  , whereas the level of expression of the remaining virulence-related genes in rs-g <dig>  was not significantly different from that in the wild type strain  . we also determined the levels of expression of six genes  in a multigene regulatory cascade responsible for transcription of the entire hrp regulon. when compared with the wild type strain gmi <dig>  the results showed that the expression level of prha and hrpg was significantly reduced in the rs-g <dig>  mutant , and the expression of prhj and hrpb was slightly lower in the rs-g <dig>  mutant than in gmi <dig>  while the level of prhr and prhi in rs-g <dig>  was almost the same as in the wild type strain  . meanwhile, both the rsfabg <dig> and the ecfabg genes could restore the expression of these genes in rs-g <dig>  to the level of the wild type strain. these data indicated that impairment of r. solanacearum virulence by deletion of rsfabg <dig> seems to be due to reduction of the expression of various genes that are related to virulence determinants.fig.  <dig> expression of the virulence-related genes in the rs-g <dig> mutant. panel a, expression of the structural genes, including flim, hrpy, hrct, hrpv and hrpx, in the rs-g <dig> strain. panel b, expression of the regulator genes, including prhj, prhr, prhi, prha, hrpg and hrpb. bacteria were cultured and rna was extracted as described in the “materials and medthods”. the rplm gene was used as the internal control for quantitative rt-pcr. the experiment was performed at least three time using independent batches of samples with similar results. results from a single representative sample are shown. the means ± sd  of three determinations from cdna from a single representative sample are shown



discussion
in bacterial fatty acid synthesis, 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase  catalyzes the key reduction of 3-ketoacyl-acps to 3-hydroxy acyl-acps  <cit> . in e. coli, fabg is the only gene that encodes 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase activity  <cit> . however, in other species of bacteria, multiple fabg paralogues have been annotated. for example, the genome of mycobacterium tuberculosis has five annotated fabg genes  <cit> . although m. tuberculosis fabg <dig> and fabg <dig> both complement a yeast Δoar <dig> mutant strain , there is no other evidence for a bacterium that has more than one functional kar. it should be noted that genomes generally encode many sdr family members and thus, in the absence of a genomic context consistent with a role in fatty acid synthesis, a true kar can be very difficult to distinguish from other sdr family members catalyzing unrelated reactions, such as reduction of the keto group of an intermediate in sugar utilization. moreover, even when a plausible genomic context is present, misannotation can occur, as was the case in lactococcus lactis where a putative kar lacked activity both in vivo and in vitro  <cit> .

growth of r. solanacearum requires rsfabg <dig>  but not rsfabg <dig>  the rsfabg <dig> gene is found within a highly conserved chromosomal gene cluster that apparently encodes several enzymes required for fatty acid synthesis, whereas the rsfabg <dig> gene is located on the r. solanacearum megaplasmid within a gene cluster containing fabb, fabf <dig> and fabf <dig>  <cit> . our prior studies have shown that the protein products encoded by the megaplasmid genes fabb, fabf <dig> and fabf <dig> do not play roles in fatty acid synthesis  <cit> , but we found that rsfabg <dig> complemented growth of the e. coli fabg strain cl <dig> and catalyzed all of the keto reduction steps in the elongation cycle of fas ii in vitro. moreover, the strain in which rsfabg <dig> had been disrupted remained viable, although the mutant strain contained significantly more ufas than the wild type strain, and was sensitive to a high salt concentration and low ph. this result indicated that the rsfabg <dig> gene plays a role in growth rate and in adaptation to environmental stress. furthermore, deletion of rsfabg <dig> reduced the ability of r. solanacearum to form a biofilm and impaired r. solanacearum swimming motility and the pathogenesis of disease in tomato plants. it should be noted that the r. solanacearum megaplasmid could reasonably be considered a second chromosome because a number of genes of primary metabolic pathways, including amino acid and cofactor biosynthesis, are encoded on the megaplasmid  <cit> . the megaplasmid also carries all of the hrp genes required to cause plant disease and encodes the constituents of the flagellum and most of the genes governing exopolysaccharide synthesis. this bipartite genome structure is characteristic of most r. solanacearum strains  <cit> , and derivatives of strain gmi <dig> lacking the megaplasmid have not been obtained  <cit> . finally bioinformatic analyses indicate that the two replicons have shared a similar evolutionary history, suggesting that the megaplasmid was not recently acquired from another organism by lateral gene transfer but is rather a part of an ancestral r. solanacearum chromosome  <cit> . therefore, the presence of a megaplasmid gene encoding a functional fatty acid synthetic enzyme and playing a role in virulence in tomato plants does not seem atypical, although this raises the question of the functions of the gene cluster .

although the protein products encoded by fabb, fabf <dig> and fabf <dig> do not play roles in fatty acid synthesis, fabb, fabf <dig> and fabf <dig> indeed display higher identities with e. coli fabf, one of the long-chain 3-ketoacyl-acp synthases  <cit> . together with our observation about rsfabg <dig> in this report, we speculate that the gene products of this cluster  may constitute a novel pathway to synthesize an unidentified signal that is related to fatty acids, which may induce r. solanacearum pathogenesis in plants. a similar scenario has been investigated in sinorhizobium meliloti, in which the nodfeg gene cluster was essential for the production of unusual α, β-unsaturated fatty acid moieties of the nod factors that trigger nodule formation on the roots of alfalfa. the gene products of nodf, node and nodg have recognizable homologies to acyl carrier protein , 3-ketoacyl-acp synthase and 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase, respectively. therefore, if the enzymes encoded by the gene cluster  are required to synthesize a specific signal that induces r. solanacearum pathogenesis in plants, it will be easy to understand why deletion of rsfabg <dig> from the megaplasmid caused the expression of virulence-related genes to decrease and reduced r. solanacearum pathogenesis in tomato plants.

meanwhile, although both rsfabg <dig> and ecfabg partially complemented the r. solanacearum fabg <dig> mutation, ecfabg restored it more effectively than rsfabg <dig> itself. this suggested that the overall cellular level of 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase activity is important for the r. solanacearum lifestyle. rhizobia present a similar scenario. the nodg gene is located in the nodfeg operon on the symbiotic plasmid of many rhizobia. it has been demonstrated that, although the nodg of r. leguminosarum has 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase activity in vitro  <cit> , the fabg gene cannot be deleted from the chromosome of s. meliloti. however, our experiments showed that, upon overexpression of nodg from plasmid psrk-gm, the fabg gene could be disrupted and the mutant strain was not defective in growth and fatty acid synthesis . this means that a high level of activity of 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase is also essential to the growth of s. meliloti.

we also tried to disrupt rsfabg <dig> in strains where rsfabg <dig> was overexpressed from a plasmid, but our attempts were unsuccessful. although the reason for this failure is unknown, it suggests that rsfabg <dig> and rsfabg <dig> are designed for distinct physiological roles. although the catalytically active sdr triad, the n-terminal cofactor binding sequence  <cit> , and two arg residues important in binding the acp moiety of the physiological substrate  <cit>  are conserved in the two proteins , rsfabg <dig> is only 41 % identical to rsfabg <dig>  moreover, rsfabg <dig> reduced acetoacetyl-coa whereas rsfabg <dig> could not. we investigated whether poor expression of rsfabg <dig> explains its inability to bypass loss of rsfabg <dig>  this does not appear to be the case, because rsfabg <dig> transcript levels were 6- to 7-fold greater than those of rsfabg <dig> in both log phase and stationary phase cultures .

CONCLUSIONS
in the bacterial fatty acid synthesis pathways studied to date only a single enzyme, fabg, has been found to catalyze the reduction of 3-ketoacyl-acps to 3-hydroxy acyl-acps. however, in this report we supply the first evidence that r. solanacearum encodes two functional fabg homologues. rsfabg <dig> is essential for growth of r. solanacearum, whereas rsfabg <dig> plays roles in determining the cellular fatty acid composition, adaptation to two environmental stresses and in the pathogenesis of disease in tomato plants. therefore, like other enzymes in the bacterial fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, one bacterium may simultaneously possess two or more 3-oxoacyl-acp reductase isozymes that have functions in fatty acid synthesis.
