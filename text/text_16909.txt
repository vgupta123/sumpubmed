BACKGROUND
wrky genes, which encode proteins binding to the cis-acting element w-box, have been isolated from many plant species  <cit> . during the past decade, numerous reports have indicated that wrky genes are involved in defence responses , development , hormone regulation , as well as sugar signalling and sesquiterpene and benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis .

the most stringent definition for a wrky binding site, a w-box, is a hexamer of ttgac, which is found in the promoter regions of many pathogenesis-related genes  <cit> . based on the core sequence  of a w-box, there are variant w-boxes, tttgaca, tttgac, ttgactt, ttgac, ttgaca, and ttgac, and a w-box like cis-element, tgac  <cit> . recently, another variant w-box, ttgacg, which carried a minimum cis-element as- <dig>  for the tga transcription factor, was reported to be bound by rice oswrky <dig> transcription factor in vitro  <cit> . furthermore, another novel wrky binding site pre <dig> , which was identified in the promoter of oswrky <dig>  participates in the self-regulation of oswrky <dig>  <cit> . previously, barley wrky protein susiba <dig> was reported to specifically bind to the sugar responsive cis-element  in addition to a w-box  <cit> . tobacco ntwrky <dig> can bind to a wk-box  in the pr-1a promoter, which deviated significantly from the consensus sequence of a w-box  <cit> . these results suggest that the cis-elements for the action of wrky proteins are variable.

computational methods that define relationships between gene expression levels and putative regulatory sequences in the promoter regions of differentially expressed genes based on large-scale microarray data and genome sequence screening are increasingly being used to establish a signal transduction network  <cit> . evidence from microarray studies revealed an overrepresentation of w-box elements within the promoters of a cluster of genes that are coexpressed during systemic acquired resistance  <cit> . transgenic atwrky <dig> microarray experiments showed that w-box elements are similarly enriched in both up- and downregulated clusters predicted by a bootstrapping program  <cit> . thus, the potential relationship between different genes, including wrky genes, may be obtained by integrating the knowledge of wrky or other transcription factors and their related regulatory elements.

rice oswrky <dig> is a potentially important transcriptional regulator involved in multiple physiological processes. it mediates disease resistance to bacterial blight caused by xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae  and fungal blast caused by magnaporthe grisea through activation of salicylic acid -dependent pathways and suppression of jasmonic acid -dependent pathways; oswrky <dig> can bind to the w-box and w-box like cis-elements that are present in the promoters of some pathogen-induced defence-responsive genes  <cit> . furthermore, genomewide analyses of the expression profiling of oswrky13-activated lines reveal that oswrky <dig> directly or indirectly regulates the expression of more than  <dig> genes  <cit> . oswrky <dig> is also a potential regulator of other physiological processes during pathogen infection. it activates redox homeostasis by the glutathione/glutaredoxin system as well as the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, which may enhance the biosynthesis of antimicrobial flavonoid phytoalexins  <cit> . oswrky <dig> inhibits the snac1-mediated abiotic stress defence pathway and terpenoid metabolism pathway to suppress salt and cold defence responses as well as to putatively retard rice growth and development  <cit> . compared to the large number of differentially expressed genes in oswrky13-activated plants, however, most oswrky13-regulated pathways have yet to be elucidated.

to understand the transcriptional regulation of oswrky <dig>  the types of transcription factors and conserved motifs in the promoter regions of the genes differentially expressed in oswrky13-activated plants were analyzed. the results suggest that the actions of oswrky <dig> on the expression of more than  <dig> genes are partitioned by different types of transcription factors through binding to distinctly distributed cis-acting elements in the promoters of oswrky13-upregulated and -downregulated genes. furthermore, oswrky <dig> appears to bind preferentially to the promoters of downregulated genes in vitro, suggesting that it may function more as a negative transcriptional regulator.

methods
microarray data
the microarray data, generated using affymetrix genechip rice genome arrays, were from our previous report  <cit>  and the data were released under accession number gse <dig> of the gene expression omnibus  database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo. the data were generated from the leaves of a pool of  <dig> 4-week-old wild-type mudanjiang  <dig>  plants and oswrky13-overexpressing independent homozygous transgenic lines, d11um1- <dig> and d11um7- <dig>  <cit> . d11um1- <dig> and d11um7- <dig> carry two and one copies of the transgene, respectively, and the two lines have more than 20-fold higher oswrky <dig> transcript levels than wild type with or without pathogen infection  <cit> .

promoter analysis
the rice genomic sequence was obtained from tigr  rice genome annotation version  <dig> . the 2-kb sequence upstream of the known or predicted coding region of rice genes that are differentially expressed on the microarray chip were identified with a 'present' call using the mas <dig> method  and their annotation was extracted. in total,  <dig>  promoter sequences were filtered for further analysis. to search for overrepresented motifs within the promoter sequences of these genes, we performed one modified perl script according to the enumerate methods of one- through 10-mer in the coregulated set of promoters . the number of occurrences of each motif was compared with an expected value derived from the frequency of that element in the whole microarray . the overrepresented motifs in up- and downregulated genes were confirmed using the binomial distribution  <cit> . only the motif with p value < 1e- <dig>  was considered significant and selected for further analysis. comparison of the detected overrepresented motifs with known cis-elements was performed using the place http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/place/signalscan.html <cit>  and plantcare http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html <cit>  databases and literature searches.

rice transformation
to construct an rna interference  vector of oswrky <dig>  a  <dig> bp cdna fragment of oswrky <dig>  obtained by pcr amplification from oswrky <dig> cdna clone ei12i <dig>   <cit>  using primers wrky12f  contained attb <dig> site  and wrky12r  contained attb <dig> site , was inserted into the phellsgate <dig> vector by bp and lr reactions . agrobacterium-mediated transformation was performed using calli derived from mature embryos of rice variety minghui  <dig>  according to the protocol of lin and zhang  <cit> 

pathogen inoculation
plants were inoculated with xoo strain pxo <dig> at the booting stage by the leaf clipping method  <cit> . rice variety mudanjiang  <dig> was susceptible to pxo <dig> and variety minghui  <dig>  was moderately resistant to pxo <dig>  mock-inoculated  plants were treated under the same condition except that the pathogen suspension was replaced with water.

quantitative reverse transcription-pcr
for rna isolation, 5- to 6-cm leaf segments located below the inoculation cutting sites were obtained. the rna sample for oswrky13-activated line was a mixture isolated from eight leaves of four plants of a t <dig> family , and the rna sample for the wild-type control was a mixture isolated from eight leaves of four mudanjiang  <dig> plants. the rna samples for oswrky13-suppressed plants were a mixture isolated from 4â€“ <dig> leaves each plant at booting stage, and the rna sample for the wild-type control was a mixture isolated from six leaves of three minghui  <dig> plants. total rna was treated for  <dig> min with dnase i  to remove contaminating dna and used for quantitative reverse transcription -pcr analysis. the qrt-pcr was conducted as described previously  <cit> . pcr primers for qrt-pcr are listed in additional file  <dig>  the expression level of actin gene was used to standardize the rna sample for each qrt-pcr. each qrt-pcr assay was repeated at least twice, with each repetition having three replicates; similar results were obtained in repeated experiments.

yeast one-hybrid assay
the interaction of oswrky <dig> protein with the dna regulatory element was assayed by yeast one-hybrid assay according to the manufacturer's protocol . in brief, the full-length cdna of oswrky <dig> was obtained by rt-pcr using primers wrky16f  harbouring a digestion site of enzyme ecori  and wrky13r  harbouring a digestion site of enzyme bamhi . the pcr product was ligated into the ecori/bamhi cloning site of vector pgadt7-rec <dig> containing a gal <dig> activation domain. the target cis-acting dna fragments harbouring w-box or w-box like elements were obtained by pcr amplification of the promoter regions of a series of genes using promoter-specific primers . the pcr products were ligated into the ecori, saci, or ecori/saci cloning site of vector phis <dig>  the negative control dna fragment  without a w-box from the promoter region of oswrky <dig> was ligated into the ecori/saci cloning site of vector phis <dig>  the yeast strain y <dig> was cotransformed with pgadt7-rec2/oswrky <dig> and phis2/target promoter or phis2/control. positive interactions were verified by growing yeast cells on sd-leu-trp-his agar medium.

RESULTS
a group of transcription factors was influenced by oswrky13
analysis of the rice whole genome microarray data, generated using affymetrix genechip rice genome arrays  <cit> , indicated that  <dig> transcription factor genes were differentially expressed after activation of oswrky <dig> . twenty-four  of the differentially expressed genes were downregulated and eight  of them were upregulated. sixteen of these transcription factor genes belong to ap2/erebp , myb , and mads  type transcription factors, which generally relate to the regulation of plant growth and development  <cit> . all of ap2/erebp type genes were downregulated in oswrky13-activated lines. these genes appear to be involved in ja-mediated signalling pathways and/or the terpenoid metabolism pathway  <cit> . furthermore, six of the seven myb type genes and one of the two mads type genes were also downregulated in oswrky13-activated plants. in addition, three of the four nac type  genes and the two wrky type genes were downregulated . among the downregulated nac type genes, snac <dig>  which is involved in abiotic stress responses  <cit> , was also negatively regulated by oswrky <dig> during pathogen-induced defence responses  <cit> . the transcription factor gene with the greatest expressional change, os08g <dig>  is putatively connected to oswrky <dig> within the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . thus, oswrky <dig> influences the expression of a subset of genes that control some key physiological processes via interaction with w-box or w-box like cis-elements  <cit> . oswrky <dig> may have further effects on additional genes through other transcription factors.

w-boxes overrepresented in the promoter regions of oswrky13-upregulated genes
functional cis-elements on plant promoters are typically found within a 2-kb range upstream of the translation start site  <cit> . to predict the genes that are directly regulated by wrky proteins, promoter sequences comprising the  <dig> kb upstream of the translation start site  were analyzed. our previous study identified  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes in oswrky13-activated lines  <cit> . only the promoter regions of  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes had transcription unit information annotated by tigr, however, and were analyzed in this study. using the method applied in this study to find conserved sequences on both strands of these promoters, a wide distribution of w-boxes  in both up- and downregulated genes was identified, but the ttgac, ttgac and ttgact elements were overrepresented in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> upregulated genes, respectively . furthermore, two conserved motifs, gttgac  and ttgacctc, were significantly enriched in both strands of the promoters of upregulated genes . the two motifs contain the typical w-box ttgac  <cit> . thus, they were considered as variant w-boxes. the gttgacc  was more enriched than gttgact  in both strands of the promoters. the gttgac motif containing the core of a w-box  was also enriched in both strands of the upregulated gene promoters. these results suggest that wrky transcription factor may play important roles in the regulation of the differentially expressed genes, especially the upregulated genes in oswrky13-activated lines, but it is unknown whether these upregulated genes are directly monitored by oswrky <dig> and/or other wrky proteins.

aonly the cis-elements putatively bound by the transcription factor types or related ones , whose expression was regulated by oswrky <dig>  were analyzed.

bp-values <  <dig>   in each category are indicated with an asterisk.

a subset of wrky family members were influenced by oswrky13
to examine whether the other rice wrky family members are directly monitored by wrky proteins, the expression profiling of wrky family members in oswrky13-activated lines was analyzed using the microarray data . in total,  <dig> wrky family members in rice were identified from the tigr database and the literature  <cit> . analysis of the promoters of these wrky genes showed overrepresentation of different w-boxes , suggesting that self-regulation by the wrky family plays an important role. however, only  <dig> wrky members, including overexpressed oswrky <dig> and downregulated oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> , produced a hybridization signal  in the rice whole genome microarray chip. the  <dig> wrky genes were classified into two groups based on a comparison of their expression patterns in two oswrky13-activated lines and wild type . twenty-seven of the  <dig> wrky genes were clustered into the downregulated group and  <dig> into the upregulated group, although most of the genes were not significantly differentially expressed in the chip based on the 2-fold change threshold.

consistent with the classification in the microarray data , using qrt-pcr analyses we confirmed that other wrky genes also showed differential expression after activation of oswrky <dig> when free of pathogen infection. these include the upregulation of oswrky <dig> and the downregulation of oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  and oswrky <dig> . the analyses also showed that the expression levels of oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> in oswrky13-activated plants were significantly higher than that in wild type and the expression levels of oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  and oswrky <dig> in oswrky13-activated plants were significantly lower than that in wild type on at least one time point after pathogen infection. furthermore, pathogen infection significantly induced the expression of oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> and suppressed the expression of oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  and oswrky <dig> in wild-type plants; pathogen infection also significantly induced oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  and oswrky <dig> and suppressed oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  and oswrky <dig> in oswrky13-activated plants .

to examine whether the differential expression of these wrky genes was due to the non-physiologic overexpression of oswrky <dig>  rnai strategy was used to generate oswrky13-suppressed plants. twenty-one independent transformants were obtained. these plants were inoculated with xoo strain pxo <dig> at booting stage. ten plants showed significantly increased susceptibility  compared to wild-type minghui  <dig> . four t <dig> families from four t <dig> plants, wrky13s <dig>  wrky13s <dig>  wrky13s <dig>  and wrky13s <dig> that showed increased susceptibility or suppressed oswrky <dig> expression, were further analyzed for their resistance to pxo <dig> and oswrky <dig> transcript level. the increased susceptibility cosegregated with the reduced oswrky <dig> transcripts in the four families . two independent oswrky13-suppressed t <dig> plants , which showed increased susceptibility and suppressed oswrky <dig> expression, were used to analyze the expression of these wrky genes after pathogen infection. the expression patterns of oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  and oswrky <dig> in oswrky13-suppressed lines were complementary to those in oswrky13-activated plants in at least one time point examined . suppression of oswrky <dig> also influenced the expression of oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig>  however, the expression patterns of oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> in oswrky13-suppressed lines were similar as those in oswrky13-activated plants . these results suggest that these wrky genes regulated directly or indirectly by oswrky <dig> may be also involved in pathogen-induced defence responses and oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> may be also regulated by other transcription factor that was influenced by oswrky <dig> 

the nine wrky genes analyzed  all harbour w-boxes in their promoters. to evaluate whether these wrky genes were directly influenced by oswrky <dig>  yeast one-hybrid assays were performed. detection of protein-dna binding activity by growth performance on sd-his-leu-trp agar medium showed that oswrky <dig> possessed specific dna-binding ability to the promoters of oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  and oswrky <dig>  but not to those of oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  and oswrky <dig> . the expression of all the genes whose promoters were bound by oswrky <dig> was suppressed in oswrky13-activated plants, suggesting that oswrky <dig> may bind preferentially to the promoters of downregulated genes in vitro. to examine this hypothesis, we randomly analyzed oswrky <dig> binding activity to the promoters of os06g <dig>  os07g <dig>  and os04g <dig>  which showed markedly induced expression in oswrky13-activated plants and a tendency of reduced expression in oswrky13-suppressed lines  and their promoters also harbour w-boxes. yeast one-hybrid assay showed that oswrky <dig> did not bind to the promoters of the three genes . thus, oswrky <dig> appears to bind preferentially to the promoters of those genes whose expression was suppressed in oswrky13-activated plants.

the promoters of oswrky13-influenced genes contain multiple types of other known cis-elements
in addition to w-boxes, other cis-elements required for binding of different types of transcription factors  were identified in oswrky13-influenced genes . among these cis-elements, myb <dig> for binding of myb type transcription factors was overrepresented in the promoters of downregulated genes. gcc-box for binding of ap2/erebp type transcription factors was underrepresented from both up- and downregulated genes .

conserved motifs harbouring known cis-elements were also identified in the promoters of oswrky13-influenced genes, but only a few of the known cis-elements are putatively bound by the types of transcription factors regulated by oswrky <dig> . the ggttagtta element enriched in the promoters of oswrky13-downregulated genes harboured the myb <dig> element , putatively for myb protein binding. the gtacgtac motif, harbouring the acgtaterd <dig> and acgtabox elements for binding of ap2/erebp or bzip types of proteins, was also enriched in oswrky13-downregulated genes. the other conserved motifs harbour known cis-elements, which are involved in biotic/abiotic responses, pollen development, and hormone responses and bound by proteins not classified among the transcription factors listed in additional file  <dig> or by unknown proteins .

the oswrky13-influenced genes are enriched with novel elements in their promoters
twelve novel elements, which were not included in the place and plantcare databases or reported in the literature, were overrepresented in the promoters of oswrky13-influenced genes . seven of the  <dig> elements were located in both strands of the promoters, and the remaining five elements were strand-dependent. novel elements  <dig> and  <dig>  enriched in the promoters of oswrky13-downregulated genes, each comprise two four-nucleotide repeats, cgat and agct, respectively. novel element  <dig> , overrepresented in the promoters of downregulated genes, is similar to a tata-box  in rice  <cit> . these results suggest that the oswrky13-regulated genes also may be monitored by wrky or other types of transcription factors through novel cis-elements.

athe letters "bs" or "ss" designate whether an element was detected as overrepresented on both strands  or on the sense strand ; "bs/ss" refers to consensus sequence from bs and ss with priority on both strands and "ss/bs" with priority on the sense strand.

bthe p-value of motif with bs/ss or ss/bs annotation was calculated by average of the p-values for bb and ss.

discussion
although oswrky <dig> is potentially involved in multiple physiological processes, including disease resistance, redox homeostasis, abiotic stress responses, and development  <cit> , the signalling pathways related to these processes remain to be elucidated. our present exploration of known and putative cis-acting elements involved in transcriptional regulation provides a better understanding of the signal transduction from oswrky <dig> to its downstream genes.

oswrky13-mediated signalling pathways are partitioned by different transcription factors
the overrepresentation of w-boxes in the promoters of upregulated genes in oswrky13-activated plants suggests that wrky proteins may play important roles in the regulation of this cluster of genes. the evidence that at least nine wrky genes are influenced by oswrky <dig> supports this hypothesis. however, the expression of eight of the nine wrky genes was suppressed after activation of oswrky <dig> with or without pathogen infection, suggesting that some of the wrky proteins might be expressional inhibitors of the upregulated genes in oswrky13-activated plants. the expression of all the nine wrky genes influenced by oswrky <dig> was pathogen-responsive in oswrky13-activated, oswrky13-suppressed, and/or wild-type plants, indicating that they are also involved in host-pathogen interactions. the present results also suggest that oswrky13-mediated signalling pathways may be directly partitioned by some wrky proteins, such as oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  and oswrky <dig>  whose promoters could be bound by and expression influenced by oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  and oswrky <dig> appeared to be involved in defence pathways, because their expression was pathogen-responsive in at least one of the two wild-type plants and overexpressing oswrky <dig> enhances rice resistance to fungal blast  <cit> . overexpressing oswrky <dig> enhances rice resistance to bacterial blight  <cit> . however, the expression of oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> was suppressed by oswrky <dig>  an activator of disease resistance, suggesting that oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> may play roles other than biotic responses when oswrky <dig> is activated. this hypothesis is supported by the evidence that oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> repress abscisic acid  induction of the aba-inducible hva <dig> promoter  <cit> . oswrky <dig> interacts with oswrky <dig> and results in enhanced binding affinity of oswrky <dig> to the promoter of the alpha-amylase gene and suppressed expression of the gene  <cit> .

consistent with suppressed expression of a subset of ap2/erebp and myb types of transcription factors, the promoters of the downregulated genes in oswrky13-activated plants are enriched with elements harbouring acgtaterd <dig>  myb <dig>  and myb <dig> cis-elements for putative binding of ap2/erebp and myb types of proteins. the acgtaterd <dig> element is water-stress responsive  <cit> . myb <dig> and myb <dig> elements are enriched in the promoters of cold- and pathogen-inducible genes  <cit> . activation of oswrky <dig> results in plants being more sensitive to abiotic stresses, including dehydration and cold stresses, in addition to exhibiting enhanced disease resistance  <cit> . thus, the ap2/erebp and myb types of transcription factors may play important roles in directly monitoring the expression of oswrky13-downregulated genes.

a group of novel and variant known cis-acting elements appear to be involved in oswrky13-mediated transcriptional regulation
oswrky <dig> and arabidopsis atwrky <dig> are functional homologues in pathogen-induced defence responses, as each serves as a node of the antagonistic crosstalk between sa- and ja-dependent pathways  <cit> . however, the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms mediated by the two wrky proteins differ. the present results show that w-boxes are only enriched in the promoters of upregulated gene in oswrky13-activated plants, but both up- and downregulated genes by atwrky <dig> are enriched with w-boxes  <cit> . the w-box like ttgaca and ttgac motifs are mostly enriched in the promoters of down- and upregulated clusters by atwrky <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the promoters of the upregulated genes by oswrky <dig> are mostly enriched with gttgac and ttgacctc motifs that harbours the typical w-box . the w-box consensus alone is insufficient for the binding of wrky proteins and additional neighbouring nucleotides or space between adjacent w-box elements also contribute to determining high-affinity binding in vitro  <cit> . thus, it appears that the 5'-residue g in the consensus gttgac motif and 3'-residues tc in the ttgacctc motif may be related to specific or high-affinity binding of certain wrky protein to the promoters of oswrky13-influenced genes. ciolkowski et al.  <cit>  reported that arabidopsis atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> bind well to w-boxes that have a g residue directly 5' adjacent to the element, whereas atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  and atwrky <dig> bind to the same motif if the 5'-residue is a t, c, or a. furthermore, bacterial challenge changed the binding intensity of proteins to w-boxes  <cit> . therefore, wrky proteins may regulate the expression of the downstream genes by pathogen-induced modification such as phosphorylation or binding to diversified w-boxes.

the variant pre <dig>  acgtaterd <dig>  and myb <dig> cis-elements for putative binding of rad51-like, ap2/erebp, and myb proteins, respectively, also may be related to binding of specific proteins or function status-modified proteins. due to the limited knowledge of cis-acting elements, the roles of the  <dig> novel conserved motifs identified in the promoter regions of oswrky13-influenced genes remains to be elucidated. however, overrepresentation of these motifs in the promoters of oswrky13-targeted genes suggests that they may play roles in oswrky13-mediated transcriptional regulation.

oswrky <dig> might bind preferentially to the promoters of downregulated genes
the bindings of oswrky <dig> to the w-box-containing promoters of  <dig> oswrky13-influenced genes, including eight up- and  <dig> downregulated genes, have been examined in vitro. the present results showed that oswrky <dig> bound to the promoters of five of the eight downregulated genes examined, but could not bind to the promoters of any of the four upregulated genes examined . our previous study showed that oswrky <dig> bound specifically to the promoters of two downregulated genes, osaos <dig> and oslox, involved in ja synthesis in defence response and one upregulated gene, pr1a, functioning in sa-dependent pathway, but oswrky <dig> could not bind to the promoters of three upregulated defence-responsive genes, osics <dig>  nh <dig>  and ospad <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, oswrky <dig> can bind to its own promoter, as revealed by gel mobility shift assays  <cit> . self-regulation of wrky genes by their own proteins has been reported in both negative and positive feedback control  <cit> . the results suggest that oswrky <dig> may function more as a negative transcriptional regulator.

CONCLUSIONS
as a potential important transcriptional regulator of disease resistance, redox homeostasis, abiotic stress responses, and development, oswrky13-mediated signalling pathways are partitioned by different transcription factors through binding to distinctly distributed cis-acting elements in the promoters of more  <dig> genes. a group of novel and variant known cis-acting elements may contribute to oswrky13-mediated transcriptional regulation. wrky proteins appear to play important roles in the monitoring of oswrky13-upregulated genes and genes involved in pathogen-induced defence responses, whereas myb and ap2/erebp proteins may contribute most to the control of oswrky13-downregulated genes. as some of the results were based only on the ectopic expression of oswrky <dig>  some of the differentially expressed genes in oswrky13-activated plants may not really function in the downstream of oswrky <dig> in physiological condition. although the actual transcriptional activation or suppression capability of oswrky <dig> remains to be determined, the present results certainly provide large amount of information for further targeted analyses of direct signal transduction from oswrky <dig> to its putatively downstream genes.
