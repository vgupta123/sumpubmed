BACKGROUND
the progressive loss of motor neurons in regions including the spinal cord and cortex is a general occurrence in the advancement of the neurodegenerative disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  . approximately 1– <dig> individuals per  <dig>  are affected by als per year with an average life expectancy of 3–5 years  <cit> . als cases can be divided into sporadic and familial classifications with the vast majority of the cases in the sporadic category  <cit> . mutations in genes including superoxide dismutase  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig> open reading frame  <dig>  have been linked to familial als  <cit> . alterations to normal expression or structure of tar dna-binding protein  <dig>  have been suggested to play a major role in als, occurring in about 97% of cases . normally tdp- <dig> is predominantly located in the cell nucleus where it participates as an important rna/dna binding protein involved in gene splicing and other rna-related processes  <cit> . however, during progression of als aggregates of tdp- <dig> accumulate in the cell cytoplasm. variations of tdp- <dig> including ubiquitinated, truncated, phosphorylated and oligomeric forms exist in als . therefore, reagents that can selectively bind different disease related tdp- <dig> variants have potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications for als.

an association between protein aggregation and disease development is also found in a number of other neurodegenerative disorders including alzheimer’s  and parkinson’s  diseases, where aggregates of beta-amyloid and alpha-synuclein, respectively, have been identified . we previously demonstrated that we could generate single-chain variable fragments  that selectively recognize different oligomeric variants of beta-amyloid, and that these scfvs could readily distinguish between human ad and control brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid  and sera samples  <cit> . similarly, we generated scfvs that selectively bind distinct oligomeric variants of alpha-synuclein, and demonstrated that these scfvs could readily distinguish between human pd and control brain tissue, csf and sera samples  <cit> . these protein variant selective scfvs were isolated using an atomic force microscopy  based biopanning protocol . the biopanning protocol utilizes a series of negative panning steps to remove phage particles that bind non-desired targets such as monomeric and fibrillar aggregates prior to completion of the positive panning step. this protocol was also utilized to generate scfvs against variants of tdp- <dig> present in human als cases   <cit> . we immunoprecipitated tdp- <dig> proteins from the homogenized motor cortex of als and control cases using a commercially available polyclonal anti-tdp- <dig> antibody as previously described  <cit> . since tdp- <dig> pathology also exists in around 45% of frontotemporal dementia  cases , we also included multiple rounds of negative panning against tdp- <dig> variants immunoprecipitated from the motor cortex of ftd cases. after biopanning, we identified  <dig> different complete scfv sequences that all preferentially bound als tissue over both ftd and healthy samples using indirect phage elisas   <cit> .

here we further characterized the  <dig> different scfvs to identify which ones reacted most strongly with als samples and to highlight the wide diversity of tdp- <dig> variants present in human neurodegenerative disease cases. we previously demonstrated a simple capture elisa that utilizes a phage-displayed detection antibody with sub-femtomolar sensitivity in conjunction with capture scfvs similar to those examined here  <cit> . here we generated a phage based detection antibody against tdp- <dig> for use in a capture elisa in conjunction with the  <dig> scfvs  to analyze sporadic als, c9orf <dig> als, ftd and control human samples .

RESULTS
selection of detection phage for capture elisa
to obtain a detection scfv that binds to all tdp- <dig> variants including healthy and disease related species, we performed a series of afm based negative and positive biopanning procedures. we first removed phages that bound off-target antigens including bovine serum album  and aggregated synthetic alpha-synuclein. we then performed sequential rounds of positive panning using tdp- <dig> immunoprecipitated from the motor cortex of healthy, als and ftd human brain tissue . following positive panning on a mica substrate containing tdp- <dig> immunoprecipitated from healthy brain tissue, bound phages were eluted and then added to mica coated with tdp- <dig> immunoprecipitated from als tissue. following elution from the als tissue, the recovered phages were added to mica coated with tdp- <dig> immunoprecipitated from ftd tissue and eluted phage recovered. the recovered phage should bind healthy and disease variants of tdp- <dig> and were sequenced to verify the integrity of their dna sequences.fig.  <dig> schematic illustrating biopanning protocol to generate generic tdp- <dig> detection phages. to isolate detection phages that bind all healthy and disease related tdp- <dig> variants, we first eliminated all phage particles that bind non-desired targets including bsa and aggregated alpha-synuclein using immunotubes. next, in the positive biopanning phase, the remaining phage particles were added to a mica surface containing tdp- <dig> immunoprecipitated from the motor cortex of healthy brain tissue. any bound phages were glycine eluted and added to a mica surface with tdp- <dig> immunoprecipitated from als brain tissue. following glycine elution the same manner of positive panning was repeated for tdp- <dig> immunoprecipitated from ftd brain tissue. eluted phages were sequenced to verify scfv integrity and larger batches of each produced for further analysis




we utilized indirect phage elisas to determine how well three of the different phages  would bind to brain tissue samples from als, ftd and control cases  and compared the results with that obtained using a commercially acquired anti-tdp- <dig> antibody . the tdpm <dig> phage most closely matched the binding of the control antibody in the phage elisas  so we selected this clone for use as the tdp- <dig> detection antibody in further analyses. we also verified that the tdpm <dig> phage worked as a detection antibody in a capture elisa. we randomly selected five of the previously isolated scfvs against als tdp- <dig> variants  for use as capture antibodies to assay tdp- <dig> immunoprecipitated from als, ftd and control tissue samples  and homogenized human brain tissue instead of immunoprecipitated proteins . using tdpm <dig> as the detection phage, all five scfvs showed strong reactivity with the als samples compared to the ftd and control samples .fig.  <dig> selection of generic tdp- <dig> binding detection phages. binding of selected phages with homogenized als, ftd and healthy control  brain tissue from the motor cortex was tested in indirect phage elisas using three of the potential detection phages and a commercial anti-tdp- <dig> antibody. the tdp- <dig> binding patterns with a tdpm <dig>  b tdpm <dig>  c tdpm <dig> and d the commercial anti-tdp- <dig> antibody were all similar. tdpm1’s reactivity with all three groups seemed the closest to the commercial anti-tdp- <dig> antibody. binding signals were represented relative to ftd. bound phages were detected with an anti-m13-hrp antibody in these indirect elisas


fig.  <dig> validation of detection phage using capture elisa with scfvs selective for als tdp- <dig> variants. soluble antibody fragments from  <dig>  of the  <dig> scfvs were produced and utilized as the capture scfvs in our phage capture elisa. a tdp- <dig> immunoprecipitated from als, ftd and healthy brain tissue  was the antigenic source and bound antigens were detected using tdpm <dig>  the results were represented as a difference between the als and both the ftd and control groups. tdpm <dig> produced strong signals with all  <dig> scfvs. b in a similar manner, substitution of brain tissue for the immunoprecipitated protein with all five capture scfvs and tdpm <dig> showed positive signals with als relative to both ftd and healthy tissue. bound phages were detected with an anti-m13-hrp antibody in these capture elisas




binding specificities of the anti-tdp- <dig> phages
phage expressing the different anti-tdp- <dig> scfvs were previously selected for preferential binding to als brain tissue samples relative to both control and ftd cases as described  <cit> . we characterized the binding of  <dig> different phage-displayed scfvs toward als, ftd and healthy human brain tissue samples from the motor cortex using a simple indirect phage elisa . the scfv clones were re-labeled in the current study to facilitate identification and simplify discussion. all scfvs were expressed in cell supernatant  and had stronger binding to als compared to both ftd and control samples  confirming the efficiency of our previously described biopanning protocol for generating reagents that bind disease specific protein variants  <cit> .

recognition of multiple tdp- <dig> variants
we next determined if the scfvs isolated from the als biopanning process were binding distinct or similar or overlapping epitopes. we performed competition elisas utilizing the same five scfvs randomly selected previously . addition of competing scfvs did not significantly reduce the detection signal indicating that the five scfvs all bind separate epitopes . while we did not perform competition elisas with all  <dig> scfvs, based on the competition elisa results obtained with these five scfvs  and the different binding intensities of the  <dig> phages , it is likely that an array of different als associated tdp- <dig> epitopes are recognized by the different scfvs.fig.  <dig> competition elisas to test for overlapping epitopes recognized by the scfvs binding als selective tdp- <dig> variants. competition capture elisas were utilized to determine if the scfvs bound similar epitopes. samples of homogenized als, ftd and healthy brain tissue  were pre-incubated with the als-tdp <dig>  als-tdp <dig>  als-tdp <dig>  als-tdp <dig> and ad-tdp <dig> scfvs individually for ~1 h. these samples were then utilized in capture elisas with the same five scfvs immobilized to the wells: a als-tdp <dig>  b als-tdp <dig>  c als-tdp <dig>  d als-tdp <dig> and e ad-tdp <dig>  bound phages were detected with an anti-m13-hrp antibody and signal intensities calculated based on the difference between the als and ftd samples. all the scfvs produced similar binding signal strengths with or without the presence of the competitive scfvs. one-way anova with lsd post hoc analysis supported the competitor scfvs’ inability to block the recognized antigenic site of our capture scfvs since no significant differences were detected between its presence and the no competition sample. overall, these results demonstrated recognition of multiple tdp- <dig> variants by our scfvs




selection of individual als cases utilizing human brain tissue
while the previous studies utilized pooled aliquots to conserve limited sample availability, selection of scfvs that bind all or different sets of als cases would be beneficial for biomarker analysis. to study individual als cases we first purified each of the scfvs using ni–nta columns  and then analyzed  <dig> als and  <dig> control homogenized brain samples individually. results from  <dig> scfvs yielding the strongest reactivity with the individual samples are shown  where the results are represented as number of standard deviations relative to the controls. as expected, all  <dig> scfvs had significantly greater binding preference for als relative to the controls . the reactivity of each sample with each scfv is shown  where each plus sign indicates an additional one standard deviation increase from the mean of the control . three scfvs  reacted with all  <dig> als samples, five  reacted with  <dig> of the  <dig> als samples and four  reacted with  <dig> of the  <dig> als cases. while each scfv showed different binding specificity to the different als samples, none of the scfvs reacted with any of the control samples. because the binding profiles of the scfvs with the different als cases varied, this provides further support that the different scfvs bind distinct tdp- <dig> antigens.fig.  <dig> characterization of individual als brain tissue samples with the different scfvs. assessment of the binding specificities of the scfvs with brain tissue  from  <dig> individual als cases and  <dig> controls . results with the  <dig> most reactive scfvs are shown: a als-tdp <dig>  b als-tdp <dig>  c als-tdp <dig>  d als-tdp <dig>  e als-tdp <dig>  f als-tdp <dig>  g als-tdp <dig>  h als-tdp <dig>  i als-tdp <dig>  j als-tdp <dig>  k ad-tdp <dig> and l ad-tdp <dig>  here we utilized a biotinylated tdp- <dig> phage capture elisa system to enhance our detection capabilities. on average, all  <dig> scfvs showed significantly greater reactivity with the  <dig> als brain tissue samples compared to the controls. statistical significance is based on one-way anova with lsd post hoc analysis at p <  <dig> . signal intensities are based on the number of standard deviations each sample is from the controls. this is calculated by subtracting the mean of the controls from each sample and then dividing the result by the sd of the controls




selection of individual als cases utilizing human plasma
since the scfvs isolated against tdp- <dig> variants selectively present in human als but not healthy brain tissue could distinguish between als and control brain tissue samples, we next determined if any of the scfvs could also distinguish amongst sporadic als, c9orf <dig> als and control plasma samples. here we tested individual plasma samples from  <dig> sporadic als cases,  <dig> als c9orf <dig> cases and  <dig> controls. results from the nine scfvs that produced significant differences between the sporadic als and control plasma cases are shown . five of the nine scfvs  also produced statistical differences between the sporadic als samples and the c9orf <dig> als cases. while most of the scfvs showed lower binding with the c9orf <dig> als samples compared to the sporadic als samples, the als-tdp <dig> scfv was the only scfv that also showed significantly higher reactivity with the c9orf <dig> als samples compared to the control group . the strength of the signals obtained with each of the scfvs toward each sample is shown where the first “+” indicates more than  <dig>  sd increase from mean of the controls and each additional “+” sign indicating an additional  <dig> sd increase . while all  <dig> scfvs reacted with each of the  <dig> sporadic als plasma samples but none of the controls, the binding profile with the c9orf <dig> als cases varied between scfvs. for example, two of the scfvs  reacted with  <dig> of the  <dig> c9orf <dig> als cases,  <dig> of the scfvs  reacted with  <dig> of the  <dig> c9orf <dig> als cases, while  <dig>  reacted with  <dig> of the  <dig> c9orf <dig> als cases, although not the same one. als-tdp <dig> did not produce strong reactivity with any of the c9orf <dig> als cases. this variation in binding intensities and sample selection again supports a difference in target recognition between the scfvs. additionally, als-tdp <dig>  als-tdp <dig>  als-tdp <dig>  als-tdp <dig> and als-tdp <dig> produced the best results with both the individually tested als brain tissue and plasma cases  indicating their potential value as biomarkers for als.fig.  <dig> characterization of individual als plasma samples with the different scfvs. human plasma samples from  <dig> sporadic als cases,  <dig> c9orf <dig> als cases and  <dig> healthy control cases were assayed for the presence of tdp- <dig> variants. results of the  <dig> most reactive scfvs are shown: a als-tdp <dig>  b als-tdp <dig>  c als-tdp <dig>  d als-tdp <dig>  e als-tdp <dig>  f als-tdp <dig>  g als-tdp <dig>  h als-tdp <dig> and i ad-tdp <dig>  a biotinylated tdp- <dig> phage capture elisa system was utilized to enhance our detection capabilities. on average, all the scfvs showed significantly greater reactivity with the sporadic als cases relative to the controls. scfvs als-tdp <dig>  als-tdp <dig>  als-tdp <dig>  als-tdp <dig> and ad-tdp <dig> also showed statistical differences between the sporadic als cases and the c9orf <dig> als samples. in addition, als-tdp <dig> could significantly distinguish between the c9orf <dig> als and control groups. statistical significance is based on one-way anova with lsd post hoc analysis at p <  <dig> . signal intensities are based on the number of standard deviations each sample is from the controls. this is calculated by subtracting the mean of the controls from each sample and then dividing the result by the sd of the controls




discussion
while tdp- <dig> pathology is present in the vast majority of examined als cases , the conformation and location of the tdp- <dig> aggregates can vary, including oligomeric, truncated, phosphorylated and ubiquitinated configurations  <cit> . isolation of reagents that can selectively recognize disease relevant tdp- <dig> variants could facilitate diagnosis of als, particularly if these variants could be detected in blood based samples during early even pre-symptomatic stages of disease progression . we previously isolated scfvs with preferential reactivity for tdp- <dig> immunoprecipitated from als human brain tissue relative to tdp- <dig> immunoprecipitated from healthy and ftd human brain tissue using our afm based biopanning procedures  <cit> . here we further identify a subset of these scfvs with diverse binding specificities that have potential applications to detect blood-based biomarkers for als.

we previously identified  <dig> distinct valid scfv sequences from the als tdp- <dig> positive biopanning and all showed preferential reactivity for homogenized human als brain tissue samples compared to ftd and control cases . we also generated a phage-displayed scfv that binds all forms of tdp- <dig> including als, ftd and healthy variants  to be utilized in our capture elisa protocol. we applied competition elisas to show that the different scfvs generated against the als relevant tdp- <dig> variants were binding different epitopes . binding intensity variations between all  <dig> phages in the indirect phage elisas  also suggest the presence of multiple tdp- <dig> variants in als.

using the scfvs in a capture elisa format, we showed that  <dig> of the scfvs can statistically distinguish between als and healthy human brain tissue samples . by plotting signal strength as a function of number of standard deviations from the control, we showed that three of the scfvs  reacted with all five als samples studied but none of the controls, while the nine other scfvs selected different combinations of 3– <dig> of the als cases and again none of the controls . the variation in signal intensities for each sample suggests that the different targeted tdp- <dig> variants are present at different concentrations in the als cases. we have previously illustrated successful identification of ad and pd sera cases using multiple scfvs  <cit>  and expect that such an approach can also be used for diagnosis of als.

to determine their potential diagnostic value, we analyzed plasma samples from  <dig> sporadic als cases,  <dig> c9orf <dig> als cases and  <dig> controls using the anti-tdp- <dig> scfvs and identified  <dig> promising scfvs. all  <dig> of the scfvs reacted with all  <dig> sporadic als cases . als-tdp <dig> and als-tdp <dig> selected  <dig> of the  <dig> c9orf <dig> als cases,  <dig> of the  <dig> scfvs recognized 1– <dig> of the c9orf <dig> als cases and als-tdp <dig> did not select any of the c9orf <dig> als cases. since the panning protocols included exhaustive negative panning against healthy control human samples, as expected, none of the scfvs reacted with any of the control samples. since more than  <dig> scfvs were generated from the tdp- <dig> panning process, it is possible that screening some of the additional remaining scfvs will identify antibody fragments that select all of the c9orf <dig> als cases. since plasma samples from different patients show different reactive profiles with the panel of anti-tdp scfvs, each patient may likely have their own personal biomarker profile corresponding to subtly different types of als. utilizing a combination of multiple anti-tdp- <dig> scfvs may prove valuable in providing a personalized diagnosis for each patient in both sporadic and familial als cases. a personalized blood-based diagnosis system could also be very helpful for initiating and monitoring treatment strategies for als  <cit> .

here we characterize the binding specificities of a subset of  <dig> anti-tdp- <dig> scfvs we previously generated  <cit>  with both human brain tissue and plasma samples to illustrate their preferential reactivity with als. the scfvs generated by selectively biopanning for tdp- <dig> variants present in als but not ftd brain tissue do preferentially bind als compared to both ftd and control samples. these results further support the proficiency of our biopanning process at isolating reagents reactive with target variants of interest. in future studies we intend to screen plasma from larger als and ftd sample sets to reaffirm which scfvs are als specific and if any also cross-react with ftd samples. also, since tdp- <dig> pathology is not unique to als and ftd, but has been detected in other neurodegenerative disease including ~ 57% of individuals with ad, 19% of pd cases, 45% of individuals having dementia with lewy bodies  and 100% of tested huntington’s cases , we also intend to screen the scfvs for cross reactivity with these other diseases. if scfvs can selectively bind specific disease cases, they may be useful reagents along with reagents to other protein variants including beta-amyloid, alpha-synuclein and tau to help improve diagnosis of different neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> .

we have previously shown that scfvs against alpha-synuclein variants associated with parkinson’s disease have excellent therapeutic value  <cit> . in a similar fashion, since our scfvs selectively bind als associated variants of tdp- <dig>  in addition to diagnostic value, the scfvs may also have potential therapeutic value.

CONCLUSIONS
our tdp- <dig> reactive scfvs were selective for individual als cases relative to controls utilizing both human brain tissue and plasma samples. the scfvs recognized both sporadic and familial als cases with plasma. these results support the potential diagnostic value of our tdp- <dig> scfvs when employed in our phage capture elisa system.
