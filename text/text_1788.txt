BACKGROUND
the conversion of arachidonic acid  to over  <dig> bioactive eicosanoids is catalyzed by a variety of enzymes including heme-containing cyclooxygenases, prostanoid synthases, lipoxygenases, and arachidonate monoxygenases. the latter, arachidonate hydroxylases and epoxygenases, comprise a subset of the cytochrome p <dig> or “cyp” gene family of evolutionarily related proteins that metabolize polyunsaturated fatty acids, steroids, as well as endogenous and exogenous toxicant molecules in organisms from bacteria to primates  <cit> .

these cyp arachidonate monoxygenases produce hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids  that modulate a variety of responses in the healthy and injured brain. hetes and eets have been implicated in the physiology of the febrile response, stimulation of hypothalamic somatostatin release, pituitary vasopressin, oxytocin and luteinizing hormone release, pancreatic glucagon and insulin release, inhibition of platelet aggregation, inhibition of the activity of na+k+-atpase in the nephron and corneal epithelium, regulation of blood pressure, vasodilation of local microcirculation in the kidney, intestine, heart and brain  <cit> . their activities include cerebral vasoconstriction  <cit>  and vasodilatation  <cit> , possibly by modulation of monovalent and divalent ion flux  <cit> .

many of these cyps are induced during inflammatory challenge, however recent evidence suggests that their products may diminish inflammation  <cit> . a number of neuron-specific effects have also been ascribed to hetes and eets, e.g., 12-hete neuroprotection from glutamate-mediated cell death  <cit>  and  <dig> -eet acceleration of axonal growth  <cit>  in primary cell cultures. in addition, eets recently have been implicated in central nociceptive and hyperalgesic responses, with different eets potentially moderating different effects on pain perception  <cit> .

brain injuries activate phospholipases and result in the release of fatty acids such as ara from damaged membranes  <cit> . within  <dig> h of traumatic brain injury , free fatty acid levels increased in human cerebral spinal fluid , compared to neurologically unimpaired controls  <cit> . arachidonic acid  increased 1093%; docosahexenoic acid  475%; oleic acid  492%; myristic acid  279%; linoleic acid  203%; and palmitic acid  175%. ara levels can remain elevated for days after tbi  <cit> . the eicosanoids formed in different brain regions in response to tbi change dynamically over the minutes, hours, and days postinjury, likely due to local alterations in the expression of their synthetic enzymes. regulation of prostaglandin and leukotriene metabolites and many of their source enzymes in the brain and after tbi have been well described  <cit> . dynamic changes in p <dig> eicosanoid levels also occur in the injured brain  <cit> . however, the production, enzymatic sources, and local regulation after brain injury of hydroxylases, epoxygenases and their products have been less well studied.

local brain hete and eet levels have not been well described due to their trace levels, short half-lives, and closely related chemical structures. moreover, because of the historic lack of gene-specific antibodies and molecular probes, it has been difficult to characterize the regulation of individual cyp genes in this large family. completion of the sequencing of the rat genome  <cit>  has yielded molecular probes specific for each identified  cyp gene family member. many quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  probe sets have now been empirically validated and are commercially available. this study utilizes qpcr to quantify multiple cyps and other eicosanoid-related gene changes in the rat hippocampus and parietal cortex at several time points after tbi. determining the regulation of these genes and their eicosanoid products in specific brain regions and at specific time points after brain injury are the first steps in the investigation of their contribution to secondary brain damage and/or recovery of function.

RESULTS
custom low density array qpcr assays, normalization and negative controls
parietal cortex and hippocampal cdna from naïve and brain-injured or sham-operated rats at  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h, or  <dig> h after surgery  were used to determine the expression profiles of  <dig> genes in custom low density arrays by qpcr . the assays included  <dig> rat cyp genes , plus  <dig> mouse cyps as negative controls;  <dig> eicosanoid-related genes that metabolize arachidonic acid or its primary metabolites;  <dig> eicosanoid receptor genes; as well as  <dig> inflammatory- or recovery-related genes; plus  <dig> highly expressed housekeeping genes.

starting with equal quantities of total rna, the housekeeping genes ppia ; glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 18s rrna were examined first to determine which to use for normalization purposes. ppia was the least variant , and subsequent qpcr ct values for each target gene were normalized as the initial copy number ratio  to compare expression of the same gene between specimens.

two cross-species negative controls were included in this study to test for amplification specificity in the highly conserved cytochrome p <dig> gene family. probe sets for mouse cyp2c <dig> and cyp2c <dig> yielded no detectable amplification products in nearly all specimens. unexpectedly, the probe set for mouse cyp2c <dig> showed expression in the injured hippocampus only at  <dig> h, in all  <dig> rats from this treatment group. upon closer scrutiny,  <dig> distinct rat sequences were found to have homology within the probe set of mouse cyp2c <dig> . however,  <dig> of the rat genes examined in these analyses  showed no changes at any time point, and the  <dig> processed pseudogenes were not assayed. this result may characterize transient local expression of a pseudogene or a new rat cyp homolog.

overview of gene expression changes
forty-five of the  <dig> genes studied showed time-dependent changes in cortex or hippocampus after tbi . sixteen arachidonate-metabolizing cyps  as well as  <dig> other eicosanoid-related genes  were temporally regulated in injured hippocampus and/or cortex. moreover, several cyps with other known functions were regulated in the brain after tbi . over half of the genes examined  showed differential expression levels between parietal cortex and hippocampus . there were  <dig> genes showing sham effects; i.e., differences between naïve mrna levels and shams at one or more time points . these were due to anesthesia or surgical intervention, and might have masked injury-related mrna changes.

temporal expression of eicosanoid-related expression after traumatic brain injury
of the genes found to change over time, expression patterns of arachidonate-metabolizing and eicosanoid-related genes , as well as other cyp genes  are presented below, organized by temporal pattern , with neuroanatomic differences noted for each.

acute changes in mrna levels were those initiated at  <dig> h or  <dig> h and did not persist at  <dig> h after tbi. in both hippocampus and parietal cortex, ptgs <dig>  was increased at  <dig> h only. in hippocampus, acute-only increases included cyp2c <dig>  cyp2c <dig>  cyp2c <dig>  cyp2c <dig>  cyp2e <dig>  cyp4a <dig> and hpgd. in cortex, acute-only increases included cyp4f <dig>  alox <dig>  alox5ap, ptges, ptgis and ptgir.

early- and delayed-onset transient changes after tbi were defined as those changes lasting more than  <dig> h but not after  <dig> h postinjury. these included ptgs <dig>  in both hippocampus and cortex; in hippocampus ptger <dig>  and ptgir ; and in parietal cortex cyp4b <dig> , pla2g4a , cyp2j <dig> and tbxas <dig> . it should be noted that changes detected at  <dig> h only might actually have been prolonged between 1d to 6d surrounding the  <dig> h timepoint.

several mrna levels changed acutely  and remained altered throughout the 7d observation period. these included cyp4b <dig> , cyp4a <dig> and ptgfrn in hippocampus; ptger <dig> and cyp4x <dig>  in parietal cortex. levels of lta4h mrna were increased biphasically, at  <dig> h and again at  <dig> h to  <dig> h in parietal cortex.

a number of genes showed delayed-onset prolonged changes . in hippocampus alox5ap, cyp2u <dig>  cyp4f <dig>  cyp4f <dig>  pla2g4a, ptger <dig>  and tbxas <dig> were increased from  <dig> h to  <dig> h; whereas cyp2j <dig>  cyp2j <dig>  ptges, ptgis, ptgdr, and ephx <dig> were increased at 168h only. in both hippocampus and parietal cortex, cyp26b <dig> and ptgds <dig> increased at  <dig> h only. it should be noted that changes detected at  <dig> h only might have occurred as early as 4d postinjury or only transiently around the 7d endpoint of this study.

temporal expression of steroid metabolizing and other cyp genes after traumatic brain injury
several other cyp genes not known to metabolize ara or polyunsaturated fatty acids showed altered levels after tbi . acute only changes from  <dig> h to  <dig> h postinjury were seen in the cortex for cyp24a <dig> and cyp27b1; and at  <dig> h only for cyp3a <dig> in hippocampus. transient changes were seen for cyp11b <dig> and cyp17a <dig> in hippocampus, and for cyp1b <dig> in cortex. acute-prolonged changes  were observed for cyp1a <dig> and cyp7a <dig> in hippocampus. several were upregulated in a delayed-prolonged manner, including cyp1b <dig>  cyp2r <dig>  cyp20a <dig>  cyp27a <dig> and cyp27b <dig> in hippocampus. interestingly, cyp2a <dig> mrna appeared below detectable levels in the hippocampus in most sham and all naïve rats except at  <dig> h postinjury , and 15/ <dig> rats had below detectable levels in parietal cortex.

localization of cyp2j <dig> and cyp27a <dig> expression
as a first step in localizing the expression of two brain injury regulated cyps of diverse function, in situ hybridization histochemistry was used to visualize cyp2j <dig> and cyp27a <dig> expression at 7d postinjury. predominantly neuronal expression was seen for both cyp2j <dig> and cyp27a <dig> in neocortex. for cyp2j <dig> mrna, cortical, hippocampal and habenular regions showed intense staining primarily in what appeared to be neuronal cells, with only light staining in the thalamus. light staining of perivascular and other cell types was evident bilaterally. little to no staining was observed in the corpus callosum or other white matter structures. expression appeared greatest in injured parietal  and piriform cortex , compared with both sham and contralateral brain regions, whereas cingulate cortex showed expression bilaterally . heaviest staining appeared in layer ii cortical neurons, ammon’s horn and dentate gyrus hippocampal neurons , with many light to moderately stained cells in deeper cortical layers. ipsilaterally, deep cortex and the hippocampal ca <dig> field showed a large number of lightly stained small cells  that were not present contralaterally. in the midbrain, light staining was observed in some neuron-like and smaller cells, and in some microvascular and blood cells throughout the brain.

a different pattern of staining was observed for cyp27a <dig> mrna. cingulate, parietal, perirhinal and piriform cortex showed cyp27a <dig> stained cells throughout all cortical layers. intense staining was observed in many cortical layer ii and deeper layer neurons , as well as ammon’s horn and dentate gyrus hippocampal neurons . medial habenula and some thalamic neurons were also intensely stained; and choroid plexus, third ventricle ependymal cells, and pial cells were moderately to intensely stained for cyp27a <dig> mrna . moderate stain was seen in some larger vascular profiles , as well as many  cells in the corpus callosum, hippocampal fimbria, and other white matter structures .

discussion
the parietal cortex and hippocampus are two brain regions that have been closely associated with the neurologic deficits observed in this model and in human brain injuries. dynamic changes in mrna levels were observed in these regions ipsilateral to tbi for many cyp arachidonate monoxygenases and eicosanoid-related genes. a number of cyp genes with other activities showed changes over time postinjury, as well. altered mrna levels do not unequivocally indicate altered enzymatic activities, however, nearly all changes showed higher mrna levels, supporting their proposed function in the sustained surge of free fatty acid metabolism proximal to the site of injury during the hours and days after tbi. altered eicosanoid metabolism at specific times after brain injuries contributes to dynamic local changes in the cerebral vasculature, inflammatory status, neural cell death, as well as neurophysiologic functions. it is not clear whether the observed responses to tbi are beneficial or not, but these results suggest brain region-specific changes in arachidonate metabolism due to alterations in the enzymatic machinery available at the time.

histochemical detection of two cyp mrnas, one known to metabolize ara  and the other known to metabolize cholesterol and vitamin d  showed different expression patterns at a time when both were induced in the injured brain. the distribution of cyp2j <dig> expression appeared to increase predominantly in cortical layer ii neurons ipsilateral to injury, whereas cyp27a <dig> appeared more widespread in neurons and other cells throughout the brain. staining for cyp27a <dig> was seen in many non-neuronal cells, particularly in lining cells of the brain and less intensely in white matter and larger vascular structures. less non-neuronal staining was seen for cyp27a <dig>  in some smaller  cells in deep cortex and hippocampus ipsitlateral to injury, as well as light staining in some microvascular structures.

the catalytic specificity of many cyp monoxygenases show promiscuous substrate specificity  and varying product profiles. this may have a number of implications after tbi, since csf levels of many free fatty acids are elevated  <cit> . one cyp enzyme may metabolize the same substrate differently in different tissues or under different conditions, thus, cyp activities remain poorly defined. still it may be useful to organize the observed changes in terms of the expected activities of the eicosanoid-related genes in the injured brain .

functionality of temporally regulated genes
early increases of prostanoid levels due to the rate-limiting enzyme cox <dig> in the injured brain, and their contribution to secondary injury has been well established  <cit> . this study revealed temporal regulation of prostanoid synthases, ptgs <dig> , ptgs <dig> , ptges , ptgds <dig> , ptgis , and tbxas <dig>  in hippocampus and cortex after tbi. in the cortex, ptgs <dig>  ptges and ptgis were acutely upregulated. interestingly, ptgds <dig> and ptgs <dig> were elevated between  <dig> to 7d postinjury. another picture emerged in the hippocampus. whereas ptgs <dig> and ptgds <dig> were upregulated as in cortex, ptges and ptgis were upregulated much later in hippocampus, at 7d postinjury. the acute elevation in cox <dig> mrna was consistent with previous results in the rat, where levels in hippocampus were greater than in cortex and cox <dig> mrna returned to sham levels by  <dig> h postinjury  <cit> . ptges is a prostaglandin  synthase that catalyzes the formation of pge <dig> from pgg2/pgh <dig> formed by cyclooxygenases. its acute induction in the cortex was followed at 7d by an increase in hippocampus. the levels of pge <dig> itself are elevated acutely after tbi in both the parietal cortex and hippocampus, and remain elevated for at least 3d postinjury  <cit> , despite the increase in hpgd mrna  in hippocampus at  <dig> h postinjury. contradictory to the finding of increased hippocampal ptges at 7d, both tissue extraction  <cit>  and hippocampal microdialysis studies  <cit>  indicated a diminution of pge <dig> levels at  <dig> to  <dig> days postinjury below that of sham animals. this increase may, therefore, represent a compensatory mechanism to return hippocampal pge <dig> levels to steady state.

thromboxane has been proposed to mediate hemostasis early after tbi by constricting blood vessels and promoting platelet activation and aggregation in damaged tissues  <cit> . acute regulation of tbxas <dig> was not observed, either because it was transiently regulated before the initial  <dig> h time point, or possibly due to posttranscriptional regulation of this activity  <cit> . unexpectedly, tbxas <dig> mrna was elevated in ipsilateral hippocampus between  <dig> to 7d postinjury . except for tbxas <dig>  these enzymes have been associated with vasodilatory activities. the results suggest a dynamic balancing of cerebral vasodilatation and vasoconstriction proximal to the site of injury after tbi. moreover, late expression of tbxas <dig> might have implications for astrocyte and microglial migration  <cit>  or remyelination  <cit>  in the injured brain.

four of the eight prostanoid receptor genes examined had altered expression levels after tbi . the prostacyclin receptor ptgir mrna levels in both hippocampus and cortex appeared to rise acutely, in parallel with ptgis in parietal cortex. in contrast, the pgd <dig> receptor ptgdr mrna was elevated at 7d in the hippocampus, while ptgds <dig> levels in both cortex and hippocampus were upregulated from  <dig> to 7d postinjury. in hippocampus, the prostaglandin receptor ep <dig>  was upregulated in what appeared to be a biphasic manner at  <dig> h and 3d postinjury. the prostaglandin receptor ep <dig>  was upregulated as well, from  <dig> to 7d in the hippocampus and throughout the time course in parietal cortex. both these genes have been associated with the vasoactivity of pge <dig>  but also have been implicated in potential neuroprotective  <cit>  and antiinflammatory  <cit>  activities in the brain.

early postinjury there was an upregulation in lipoxygenase-associated gene expression  in the cortex. only alox5ap mrna was elevated in hippocampus, from  <dig> to 7d postinjury. leukotriene products are known to promote neuroinflammation, increased vascular permeability, and edema  <cit> ; but may also be associated with the production of potentially neuroprotective hetes  <cit> . however, unlike formation of 12-hete by cyps, the 12-lipoxygenase pathway produces potentially neurotoxic hpete intermediates  <cit> . perhaps in response, several cyps that metabolize leukotrienes  as well as the leukotriene hydrolase lta4h  appeared to be upregulated in the cortex. protein levels of lta4h have only recently been characterized in the brain  <cit> .

of the sixty-five cyp genes assayed, sixteen arachidonate-metabolizing cyps  and twelve other cyps  were regulated in the injured brain regions examined. in the hippocampus at  <dig> h after tbi, cyp2c <dig>  cyp2c <dig>  cyp2c <dig>  cyp2e <dig>  and cyp4a <dig> mrnas were elevated . the increased levels of cyp2c <dig>  cyp2c <dig>  and perhaps cyp2c <dig>  represent activities that synthesize various eets  <cit> , with predominantly vasodilatory activity  <cit> . except for cyp4a <dig>  these enzymes have been associated with hypertension; namely, depletion of these activities appears to result in vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure  <cit> .

an arachidonate ω-hydroxylase, cyp4a <dig> likely produces 20-hete as its main product  <cit>  . in addition, hippocampal levels of cyp4a <dig>  also associated with 20-hete formation  <cit> , were elevated throughout the time course studied. thus, cyp4a <dig> and cyp4a <dig> stand out as acute and chronic vasoconstrictive activities, respectively, particularly after brain injuries  <cit> .

at later times postinjury, hippocampal cyp2j <dig>  cyp2j <dig>  cyp2u <dig>  cyp4f <dig>  and cyp4f <dig> levels were elevated. cyp2j <dig> and cyp2j <dig> likely produce mainly eets  <cit> . cyp2u <dig> catalyzes predominantly 19- and 20-hete formation  <cit> , whereas the cyp4f <dig> and cyp4f <dig> hydroxylases appear to inactivate leukotrienes  <cit> . as with the prostanoid synthases, it appears that regulation of both vasodilatory and vasoconstrictive cyp activities may be required to balance the circulatory needs of the injured hippocampus.

in the cortex, only two cyp arachidonate monoxygenases were acutely upregulated after tbi. at  <dig> h, cyp4f <dig>  and from  <dig> h to 3d postinjury cyp4b <dig> mrna levels were elevated. both these genes have been associated with potentially neuroprotective activities. cyp4f <dig> metabolizes proinflammatory leukotrienes  <cit>  and cyp4b <dig> has been implicated in 12-hete synthesis in ocular tissues  <cit> . hampson and grimaldi  <cit>  found that 12-hete can protect neurons from glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in vitro. interestingly, while elevated cyp4b <dig> mrna was seen at  <dig> h in the cortex, its elevation was delayed until  <dig> h postinjury in the hippocampus, a site of extensive apoptotic cell death  <cit> .

another conspicuous finding was the reduced mrna level of cyp4x <dig> in the cortex throughout the postinjury period. this gene is predominantly expressed in brain  <cit>  and has recently been characterized in converting the endocannabinoid anandamide to a single monooxygenated product,  <dig> -epoxyeicosatrienoic ethanolamide  <cit> . the observed reduction of this activity might contribute to endocannabinoid-mediated neuroprotection after tbi  <cit> .

several cyps not directly associated with polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism also showed time- and tissue-dependent changes after tbi that might be relevant to secondary injury and recovery. cyp27a <dig>  the sterol 27-hydroylase, was differentially expressed after tbi. hippocampal cyp27a <dig> mrna levels increased 3- to 8-fold at  <dig> h to  <dig> h postinjury, respectively, whereas cortical levels did not appear to change. histochemistry revealed cells intensely stained for cyp27a <dig> mrna throughout the cortex, deep brain structures, and meninges, choroid plexus and ependymal cells. peripherally, this enzyme metabolizes bile acids, cholesterol and vitamin d <dig>  and has been suggested to contribute to neurodegenerative disease by increasing cholesterol penetration across the blood brain barrier by conversion to 27-hydroxycholesterol  <cit> . conversely, intrinsic brain expression of cyp27a <dig> might enhance the egress of cholesterol, released from damaged cell membranes, from the brain to the peripheral circulation.

two of the cyps acutely induced in the brain after tbi have been shown to be regulated by acute stress-related stimuli . for example, cyp2c <dig> is rapidly induced by glucocorticoids in rat hepatoma cells  <cit> , and is a close homolog of human cyp2c <dig> and cyp2c <dig> implicated in eicosanoid production  <cit> . also acutely regulated, cyp2e <dig> is a major ethanol-inducible gene in the liver and metabolizes arachidonic acid to hetes  <cit> . its expression is ~1000-fold lower in the hippocampus than the liver, and is induced in neural cells by high concentrations of ethanol  <cit> .

surprisingly, cyp2e <dig> inhibition has been shown to increase rat brain dopamine levels, implicating it in catecholamine biotransformation  <cit> . selected members of the cyp2d subfamily  also have been shown to synthesize dopamine in vitro and in vivo  <cit> , although none of these genes were regulated in hippocampus or cortex after tbi. dopamine levels decrease acutely in the traumatically injured rat cortex, but showed increased levels in hypothalamus and striatum as soon as 1h or 6h postinjury, respectively  <cit> . these regional changes might reflect regional decreases in cyp2e <dig> expression, or increased cyp2d activity. further study of hypothalamic and striatal gene expression may clarify the contribution of cyps to acute dopamine fluxes after tbi.

in addition to its possible role in eet production, cyp2c <dig> is both regulated by and able to metabolize all-trans retinoic acid  <cit> . its acute regulation after tbi suggests the possibility of transducing cross-lipid signalling, perhaps with respect to neuroinflammatory cell proliferation  <cit> . in addition, cyp26b <dig> metabolizes retinoic acid, including “all trans” retinoic acid, a process thought to contribute to regulation of spatial patterning during neurogenesis  <cit>  and neuroplasticity  <cit> . induced in both cortex and hippocampus at 7d postinjury, this enzyme might contribute to neuroplasticity in the injured brain, possibly in the formation of neuronal-astroglial boundaries.

tbi-mediated regulation of cyp17a <dig> was observed only in the hippocampus, being elevated at the  <dig> h time point. cyp17a <dig>  the steroid 17alpha-hydroxylase/ <dig> -lyase, is one of the key enzymes in glucocorticoid, dehydroepiandrosterone, and androgen biosynthesis  <cit> . its activity in the brain, until fairly recently a matter of debate, has been established  <cit> . this activity is known to metabolize progesterone, a neuroprotective neurosteroid  <cit>  now in phase iii clinical trials for treatment of tbi  <cit> . this is also a critical step in the biosynthesis of other potentially neuroprotective neurosteroids, including dehydroepiandrosterone  <cit> , testosterone  <cit> , and estradiol  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether the enhancement of this activity  after brain injury would improve the recovery phenotype.

tissue-specific differences between cortex and hippocampus were observed in basal mrna levels in over half the genes examined. in addition, hippocampus and cortex responded differently in most cases of injury-induced changes, as well. nonetheless, nine genes were coordinately regulated, increasing approximately the same extent, at similar time points in both tissues. these were alox5ap, cyp2j <dig>  cyp26b <dig>  pla2g4a, ptgir, ptgs <dig>  ptgs <dig>  ptgds, and tbxas <dig>  this might be attributable to release of factors into the blood or csf, or neurotransmitter-mediated induction of these genes in multiple brain regions. global changes were also observed in comparing naïve and sham-operated animals in a number of genes , suggesting that anesthesia and/or craniotomy induced global, sometimes lasting changes in the brain.

CONCLUSIONS
this qpcr study has established detectable mrna levels for several cyps not previously described in the brain . this suggests the presence of these activities, despite any lack of change postinjury. there will be, going forward, a need for further study to better understand these results. for example, only changes greater than 50% in parietal cortex or hippocampus were analyzed in this study due to the large number of genes examined. based on these mrna and limited histochemical results, it would be of interest to determine the regulation of these cyp and eicosanoid-related genes in more distal brain regions, e.g., hypothalamus, dorsolateral thalamus, piriform cortex or amygdala, where neurologic dysfunction might also impact brain injury recovery. these and more subtle changes in gene expression, and in other brain regions, likely contribute to the overall maintenance of lipid metabolism in the healthy brain, and have implications for neural changes in arachidonate metabolism in response to injury.

the dynamic environment in the brain after traumatic injury likely requires different metabolic events at different times for optimal repair to proceed. it may be speculated that timely regulation of arachidonic acid metabolism contributes to functional recovery after tbi. to determine whether these eicosanoid-related changes in gene expression are adaptive or pathologic, pharmacologic and/or genetic manipulation of each gene  will need to be performed at a given time after brain injury. thus, the investigation of arachidonic acid metabolism in the brain continues to be a fertile field of investigation.
