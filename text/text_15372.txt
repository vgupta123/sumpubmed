BACKGROUND
the gag polyprotein precursors are the key structural elements driving retroviral particle production. the n-terminal matrix  domain of the gag precursor is important for plasma membrane  targeting and membrane binding. following gag targeting, the process of assembly proceeds via gag multimerization mediated primarily by sequences within the capsid  and nucleocapsid  domains. finally, the "late" domains in gag mediate the terminal step in particle production - the pinching off of the virion from the infected cell membrane  <cit> . concomitant with virus release the particle undergoes maturation, a structural reorganization of the virion that results from a highly concerted catalytic cascade mediated by the viral protease   <cit> .

while the gag precursor proteins are the sole viral determinants required for the production of immature virus-like particles , a number of host factors have been implicated in various steps of the virus assembly and release pathway. retroviral late domains are known to interact with components of the endosomal sorting machinery. for example, the hiv- <dig> gag precursor protein, pr55gag, contains in its p <dig> domain a pro-thr/ser-ala-pro  motif that binds tsg <dig>  a component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport-i   <cit> , and a tyr-pro-xn-leu  motif that interacts with the escrt-associated factor alix  <cit> . the physiological role of the escrt machinery is to promote the biogenesis of vesicles that bud into the lumen of late endosomes to form multivesicular bodies   <cit> . the recruitment of tsg <dig> from the cytoplasm to endosomal membranes occurs via interaction between tsg <dig> and hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate   <cit> . the delivery of cargo proteins to mvbs usually requires the recognition by escrt machinery of monoubiquitin moieties attached to the cytoplasmic domains of the cargo. in yeast, disruption of any of the components of the escrt complexes and associated factors  results in failure of proper sorting of ubiquitinated proteins and induction of an aberrant class e compartment  <cit> . retroviral gag proteins are also ubiquitinated  <cit> , and while ubiquitination of gag does not appear to play an essential role in virus budding  <cit> , in the absence of a functional late domain ubiquitin can serve to promote virus release  <cit> .

in addition to serving a well-established role in retrovirus budding, host cell factors have also been reported to function in promoting gag trafficking to the pm. we previously reported that the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol--bisphosphate  is a key cellular cofactor for hiv- <dig> gag targeting to the pm  <cit>  via a direct ma-pip <dig> interaction  <cit> . the clathrin adaptor protein complexes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> , suppressor of cytokine signaling  <dig>   <cit> , the kinesin kif <dig>  <cit> , staufen  <dig>  <cit> , and plenty of sh3s   <cit>  have all been implicated in gag targeting to the pm. we demonstrated previously that overexpression of the golgi-localized, γ-ear containing, arf-binding  proteins inhibits the production of hiv- <dig> and equine infectious anemia virus  particles by impairing the association of gag with membrane  <cit> . the impairment in gag-membrane binding induced by gga overexpression was linked to functional disruption of the endogenous adp ribosylation factors   <cit> .

the gga proteins are a family of monomeric clathrin adaptors primarily localized at the trans-golgi network , although also reported to be present in late endosomes  <cit> . three gga proteins  are expressed in mammals and two in yeast and there is ample evidence demonstrating that these proteins help package cellular cargo into clathrin-coated vesicles  <cit> . ggas are comprised of four distinct domains: 1) an n-terminal vps <dig>  hrs, and stam homology  domain that binds cargo proteins and cargo protein receptors  bearing asp-x-x-leu-leu  motifs; 2) a gga and tom  domain that binds arfs, ubiquitin, and tsg101; 3) a hinge region that recruits clathrin; and 4) a c-terminal γ-adaptin ear homology  domain that binds several proteins including rabaptin  <dig>  epsinr, and γ-synergin. the gat domain is responsible for recruitment of gga proteins to membrane via interaction with gtp-bound arf  <cit> .

previously, we reported that gga overexpression induces the formation of large swollen vacuolar compartments that sequester arf proteins. the compartments induced by gga <dig>  but not those induced by gga <dig> or gga <dig>  also sequester hiv- <dig> gag  <cit> . we and others have also demonstrated in previous studies that overexpression of dominant-negative or full-length components of the escrt complexes and associated machinery gives rise to the formation of aberrant compartments that disrupt retroviral particle production. for example, overexpression of full-length tsg <dig>  induces a class e-type compartment that potently disrupts hiv- <dig> budding but has minimal effect on eiav release  <cit> . overexpression of the c-terminal portion of tsg <dig>  generates aggresome-like structures and severely inhibits the release of hiv- <dig>  murine leukemia virus , and rous sarcoma virus  but does not disrupt eiav release  <cit> . a dominant-negative, atpase-deficient mutant of vps <dig> is highly disruptive to the release of a number of retroviruses including hiv- <dig>  eiav, rsv, and feline immunodeficiency virus   <cit> . it is noteworthy that each of the compartments described above is morphologically distinct and imposes selective defects on specific steps in the retroviral assembly and release pathway. for example, gga overexpression leads to a defect in gag trafficking to the pm, whereas tsg-f, tsg-3', and dominant-negative vps <dig> overexpression inhibits particle budding and release.

in the current study, we characterized the compartments induced by gga overexpression with regard to their composition as well as their impact on retrovirus assembly and cellular endosomal sorting pathways. our data demonstrate that gga overexpression causes various sorting defects as measured by recycling of cd-mpr, internalization of transferrin receptor , and the subcellular localization of proteins like tsg <dig>  ubiquitin, and hrs. the determinants for hiv- <dig> gag sequestration in gga1-induced compartments were mapped to the ma domain. these data provide novel insights into the defects in cellular sorting and retrovirus assembly induced by gga overexpression.

RESULTS
gga overexpression induces the generation of enlarged vacuolar compartments that bear golgi markers
previously we showed that gga overexpression leads to the accumulation of large, swollen vacuolar structures and severely inhibits retrovirus particle production  <cit> . in the current study, we sought to characterize in detail the phenotype and composition of these gga-induced structures. as reported previously  <cit> , endogenous ggas predominantly localize to a perinuclear region, with some small puncta also evident at the pm, particularly for gga <dig> . all three endogenous ggas colocalized with golgi markers . in contrast, hela cells overexpressing exogenous ggas showed the accumulation of large, vacuolar compartments . similar structures were also evident upon overexpression of gfp-tagged ggas but these tended to be smaller in size . these gga-induced compartments were seen in approximately half of the transfected cells , with those expressing lower levels of gga proteins showing a localization pattern similar to that of the endogenous ggas . in parallel, we compared the localization of other cellular proteins which, when overexpressed, also disrupt retroviral particle production and induce the formation of abnormal intracellular structures  <cit> . as reported previously, overexpression of full-length tsg <dig>   <cit>  or a gfp-fused, dominant-negative e228q vps <dig> mutant   <cit>  induced the formation of swollen endosomal structures known as class e compartments . in contrast, overexpression of the c-terminal portion of tsg <dig>  led to the generation of larger, aggresome-like structures   <cit> . to determine whether overexpressed gga proteins colocalized with each other, we cotransfected cells with vectors expressing the following combinations of tagged gga proteins: gfp-gga <dig> + myc-gga <dig>  gfp-gga <dig> + myc-gga <dig>  and myc-gga <dig> + gfp-gga <dig>  microscopic analysis indicated a high degree of colocalization  of these combinations of gga proteins .

we next sought to define the composition and subcellular origins of the gga-induced structures. gga-overexpressing cells were stained with antibodies specific for the endoplasmic reticulum -resident proteins calnexin and calreticulin, the trans-golgi network  marker tgn <dig>  the golgi matrix marker gm <dig>  the early endosome marker early endosomal antigen  <dig> , and the late endosome marker cd <dig>  we observed that the gga-induced structures did not contain er or late endosome markers  but did display a high degree of colocalization with tgn <dig>  . interestingly, only the gga3-induced structures stained for gm <dig> , a detergent-insoluble component of the golgi matrix peripherally associated with the cis compartment   <cit> . these results suggest that gga overexpression induces the formation of aberrant compartments derived from the golgi but the specific composition of compartments induced by overexpression of gga <dig>  gga <dig>  or gga <dig> is not identical.

brefeldin a dissociates endogenous ggas from membranes but does not lead to a disintegration of gga-induced compartments
treatment of cells with the fungal toxin brefeldin a  leads to the dissociation of arf-dependent coats, including the gga proteins, from membranes  <cit> . it was therefore of interest to determine whether bfa treatment dissociates gga-induced structures. untransfected hela or gga-overexpressing cells were treated with bfa at  <dig> μg/ml for  <dig> h, fixed and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. bfa treatment led to the apparent dissociation of endogenous ggas from membranes, as indicated by a shift in gga localization from small puncta to a hazy, diffuse pattern . in contrast, bfa treatment had no effect on the morphology of gga-induced structures, and the size and number of swollen compartments remained unchanged . similar results were seen when cells were treated with higher bfa concentrations or for longer periods of time . because the interaction of ggas with arf proteins is important for gga-membrane binding,  <cit> , as a control we examined the phenotype of n194a gga mutants defective in arf binding. interestingly, the gga-n194a mutants also showed massive accumulation of enlarged, swollen, vacuolar compartments . notably, in cells expressing low levels of gga-n194a protein, a diffuse staining pattern was observed , consistent with a previous report  <cit> . these findings demonstrate that while endogenous gga proteins dissociate from membranes upon bfa treatment, the morphology of gga-induced compartments is not altered by bfa treatment. while it is possible that the bfa insensitivity of the gga-induced compartments is due to a high level of exogenous gga expression, the bfa data combined with the observation that arf-binding-deficient gga mutants still induce these compartments suggest that the association of exogenously expressed ggas with membrane is not required for the formation and maintenance of gga-induced structures.

gga-induced compartments are positive for the aggresome marker gfp-250
we next characterized the gga-induced compartments by determining whether they are aggresome-like structures. aggresomes are formed in response to protein misfolding or high protein concentrations in the cytoplasm  <cit> . other factors such as a change in ph, temperature, ionic strength, or inhibition of a specific degradative pathway can also lead to protein aggregation  <cit> . gfp- <dig> is a protein previously characterized to form aggresome-like structures; it is composed of gfp fused to a 250-amino acid fragment of the cytosolic protein and membrane transport anchor, p <dig>  <cit> . hela cells cotransfected with vectors expressing gfp- <dig> and myc-tagged gga proteins were stained and analyzed by microscopy . gga-overexpressing compartments colocalized significantly with gfp- <dig>  as a positive control, we compared the gga-induced structures with those formed upon tsg-3' expression, as these have been reported to be positive for gfp- <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, em analysis of gga- or tsg-3'-overexpressing cells showed an abundance of irregular, electron-dense accumulations of varying densities, shapes and sizes , which are typical of aggresome-like structures.

gga overexpression sequesters cell sorting machinery
as shown above, gga overexpression leads to the accumulation of large swollen compartments. we hence investigated the physiological consequences of gga overexpression by monitoring epidermal growth factor  receptor internalization, tfr endocytosis, and cd-mpr recycling. gga-overexpressing cells were treated with texas red-tagged egf or fluorescently tagged transferrin  conjugates in serum free medium, followed by fluorescence microscopy. gga overexpression did not significantly alter egf receptor internalization . however, gga overexpression led to abnormal uptake of transferrin conjugates from the pm. as shown in figure 4a, in control cells, tf- <dig> is rapidly internalized from the pm and can be readily detected in the perinuclear region within  <dig> minutes. in contrast, cells overexpressing the gga proteins showed markedly diminished staining with tf- <dig>  at time zero due to sequestration of tfr in gga-induced compartments as detected by staining of gga-overexpressing cells with anti-tfr antibody . gga overexpression also led to the steady-state accumulation of cd-mpr within gga-induced structures and its depletion from the periphery . these data demonstrate that overexpression of gga proteins disturbs cellular sorting pathways, specifically those involved in tfr but not egf receptor turnover.

gga overexpression alters the localization of cellular endosomal sorting factors important for retrovirus budding
we next studied the effect of gga overexpression on the localization of host factors described to be important for retrovirus release. to this end, cells were transfected with vectors expressing ha-tagged tsg <dig> and myc-tagged gga <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. exogenously expressed, full-length tsg <dig>  localized to enlarged endosomal structures throughout the cell . interestingly, however, gga overexpression led to sequestration of exogenous tsg <dig> on gga-induced structures with high degree of colocalization . we next studied the effect of gga overexpression on hrs, which recognizes ubiquitinated cargo on early endosomes as part of a complex with signal transducing adaptor molecule  <dig>  and stam <dig>  <cit> . hela cells were cotransfected with vectors expressing myc-tagged hrs and gfp-tagged gga proteins  and were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. as expected  <cit> , when expressed alone, myc-hrs localized to small puncta typical of early endosomes . however, a different localization pattern was observed upon overexpression of the gga proteins. gga <dig> overexpression did not significantly alter the localization pattern of hrs nor was there appreciable gga1/hrs colocalization. in contrast, hrs appeared to localize to the limiting membrane of gga2-induced structures and colocalized with gga <dig> to a significant extent  .

gga-induced structures sequester ubiquitinated cargo
to further define the composition of the gga-induced structures, we next asked whether they sequester ubiquitin or ubiquitinated cargo. hela cells transfected with gga expression vectors were stained with an antibody that recognizes polyubiquitinated proteins but not free ubiquitin  <cit> . as shown in figure 6a, gga-induced structures were strongly positive for ubiquitinated cargo, especially in the case of gga <dig> and gga <dig>  to confirm the previous observation that gga proteins bind directly to ubiquitin  <cit> , lysates from cells expressing myc-tagged ggas were immunoprecipitated with ubiquitin-agarose beads followed by immunoblotting with anti-myc antibody. we observed that all the gga proteins bound to ubiquitin-agarose but not protein a-agarose beads . the gga <dig> l276a mutant, which displays impaired ubiquitin binding  <cit>  but still induces the formation of aberrant compartments , served as a negative control . because gga-induced structures accumulate ubiquitinated proteins  and gga overexpression inhibits hiv- <dig> release  <cit> , we asked whether expression of exogenous ubiquitin could reverse gga-mediated inhibition of hiv release. hela cells were transfected with a ubiquitin expression vector along with gga expression constructs and analyzed by microscopy. surprisingly, expression of ubiquitin led to disappearance of the large gga-induced structures . gga proteins were expressed at comparable levels in the presence or absence of ubiquitin overexpression, as determined by western blot analysis . similar results were obtained when gga vector dna was used in a five-fold excess relative to ubiquitin expression plasmid . as a control, we examined whether ubiquitin overexpression disrupted the accumulation of compartments induced by tsg-3'. as shown in figure 6c, ubiquitin overexpression had no effect on the formation of tsg-3'-induced structures. finally, we investigated whether exogenous ubiquitin expression affected the virus release defect induced by gga overexpression. remarkably, we observed that cotransfection of ubiquitin and gga expression vectors rescued hiv- <dig> particle production when compared to transfection of gga vectors alone . together, these data indicate that gga-induced structures sequester ubiquitinated proteins. moreover, expression of exogenous ubiquitin along with the gga proteins diminishes the induction of vacuole-like compartments, which correlates with partial rescue of virus release.

gag sequestration in gga1-induced structures requires the ma domain and gag binding to membrane
we demonstrated previously that gga overexpression inhibits retrovirus particle production, which in the case of gga <dig> is in part due to sequestration of hiv- <dig> gag in gga1-induced structures  <cit> . we also observed that an hiv- <dig> construct lacking the ma domain  is resistant to inhibition mediated by gga overexpression  <cit> . we therefore sought to define the determinants in hiv- <dig> gag responsible for recruitment into gga1-induced compartments. hela cells were transfected with the gga <dig> expression vector along with either full-length pnl4-3; fyn10fullma, a pnl4- <dig> derivative expressing gag bearing at its n terminus the ten-amino-acid membrane-targeting signal from fyn  <cit> ; fyn10deltama, a pnl4- <dig> derivative expressing gag bearing the ten amino acid residues from fyn and lacking the ma domain  <cit> ; or pnl4-3/1ga, which expresses a non-myristylated gag mutant  <cit> . cells were then stained using an anti-hiv- <dig> p <dig>  antibody and the degree of colocalization between gga <dig> and gag was quantified. interestingly, gga1-induced structures sequestered wt and fyn10fullma gag but not fyn10deltama gag suggesting a requirement for the ma domain in gag sequestration . moreover, the gga1-induced structures did not colocalize with 1ga gag, demonstrating that gag recruitment into gga1-induced structures required gag-membrane binding . finally, we asked whether non-hiv- <dig> gag proteins are also sequestered in gga1-induced structures. interestingly, eiav gag showed a high degree  of colocalization with gga1-induced structures  whereas mlv gag demonstrated a lower level of colocalization  with these structures .

discussion
previously we showed that gga overexpression modulates retrovirus assembly by inhibiting gag targeting to the pm. gga overexpression also induced the accumulation of large vacuolar structures, which in the case of gga <dig> sequestered hiv- <dig> gag  <cit> . in the current study, we investigated in detail the morphology and composition of gga-induced compartments and the impact of their formation on normal cellular physiology and retrovirus release. we observed that gga-induced compartments stained positively for golgi and aggresome markers, and gga overexpression caused defects in endosomal sorting. moreover, gga overexpression also altered the localization of various host proteins important for retrovirus assembly. overexpression of ubiquitin led to a dissolution of the gga-induced structures and a partial rescue of hiv- <dig> release. study of determinants for hiv- <dig> gag sequestration in gga1-induced compartments demonstrated a role for the ma domain. thus, gga overexpression not only inhibits retrovirus assembly and gag localization but also alters the cellular sorting pathways important for normal cellular physiology.

gga proteins when expressed exogenously in cells whether transiently or stably have been reported to show a localization pattern similar to that of their endogenous counterparts  <cit> . indeed, tagged gga expression vectors have been widely used in the field of cell biology to substitute for the use of gga antibodies. however, we observe defects in endosomal sorting induced by even moderate levels of gga overexpression and the formation of vacuolar compartments in which the exogenously expressed gga proteins are localized. this phenotype is similar to the gga expression pattern reported previously, namely, "compaction and fizzling" of golgi stacks and accumulation of fragmented vacuolar-like blobs that contain golgi markers  <cit> . gga overexpression also led to striking changes in tfr distribution and recycling of cd-mpr. following ligand binding to the tfr, both receptor and ligand are rapidly internalized and transported to acidic compartments in which the receptor is released and recycled back to the cell surface  <cit> . however, in cells overexpressing the gga proteins, there was no evidence of the bright cell surface staining with fluorescently tagged transferrin that is observed in cells not overexpressing the ggas. this loss in transferrin binding was due to sequestration of tfr in gga-induced compartments. gga overexpression led to the accumulation of cd-mpr in the golgi with a concomitant depletion from the periphery. this alteration in cd-mpr recycling has also been described previously in cells expressing a dominant-negative fragment of gga <dig> comprising the vhs-gat domain but lacking the hinge and gae domains  <cit> .

gga overexpression also led to alterations in the subcellular localization of several host proteins implicated in retrovirus assembly and release. we previously observed that gga overexpression led to sequestration of arfs  <cit> . moreover, gga overexpression also caused a shift in the localization of overexpressed tsg <dig> and hrs . of particular interest were the observations that gga-induced compartments sequestered ubiquitinated cargo and providing exogenous ubiquitin not only resolved the gga-induced structures but also rescued hiv- <dig> release . we speculate that gga-induced structures are formed as a result of misfolded protein accumulation, which due to ubiquitin sequestration are incapable of being targeted for proteasomal degradation  <cit> . providing exogenous ubiquitin could facilitate destruction of misfolded proteins leading to the disappearance of gga-induced structures. interestingly, this phenomenon was not observed for tsg-3'-induced structures despite their ability to sequester ubiquitinated cargo. the observations that bfa did not disrupt the gga-induced compartments and that these compartments were still induced by the arf-binding-deficient gga mutants  argue that formation of the gga-induced structures is independent of arf binding and gga membrane association. these gga-induced structures possess some properties of aggresomes  but are clearly distinct in terms of composition and inhibitory activity from the aggresome-like structures induced by tsg-3'. most notably, tsg-3'-induced structures primarily block virus budding and do not interfere with eiav release  <cit> , whereas gga-induced structures impair gag association with membrane and display inhibitory activity against hiv- <dig> and eiav . the distinct phenotypes of these compartments is likely due to differences in the proteins that they sequester. purification of these aberrant structures and proteomic characterization of their composition would potentially provide additional insights into host cell machinery required for gag trafficking to the plasma membrane and virus budding.

although the three mammalian gga proteins are closely related, in our studies they have shown some notable differences: 1) depletion of gga <dig>  and to a lesser extent gga <dig>  stimulated hiv- <dig> release whereas gga <dig> depletion did not  <cit> . 2) whereas the compartments induced by overexpression of each of the three gga proteins stained positively for the tgn marker tgn <dig>  only those induced by gga <dig> were positive for the detergent-insoluble cis-golgi marker gm <dig> . 3) compartments induced by gga <dig> trapped hiv- <dig> gag, whereas those induced by gga <dig> or gga <dig> did not  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether the gga proteins interact directly with gag or whether differential association with other host cell factors could explain the ability of gga <dig> but not gga <dig> or gga <dig> overexpression to trap gag. in this study, we observed that fyn10deltama and the non-myristylated hiv- <dig> gag mutant were not sequestered in gga1-induced compartments, indicating a requirement for the ma domain and gag membrane binding in gag trapping.

in contrast to the gag sequestration data, in virus release assays both fyn10fullma  and fyn10deltama  <cit>  were resistant to inhibition mediated by gga overexpression. this observation suggests that gag sequestration is not the sole cause of inhibition mediated by gga <dig> overexpression. it is also possible that the fyn targeting signal, which confers strong membrane binding ability, is able to rescue the inhibition. interestingly, eiav particle production is also inhibited by gga overexpression  <cit>  and eiav gag is sequestered in gga1-induced structures . moreover, while overexpression of gga <dig> and gga <dig> mutants defective in arf binding  was no longer inhibitory to hiv- <dig> and eiav release, the gga1-na mutant was still capable of inhibition and gag sequestration  <cit> . overall, these findings indicate intriguing differences in the mechanisms by which overexpression of the three gga proteins inhibit retroviral particle production.

CONCLUSIONS
in the current study, we extend our previous findings and characterize in detail the structures induced by gga overexpression with respect to their impact on cellular sorting pathways and their ability to inhibit retroviral particle production. we observe that the compartments induced by gga overexpression are distinct from those formed by dominant-negative components of the escrt pathway, both in terms of their effect on cellular functions and with respect to the step in the retrovirus assembly and release pathway that they disrupt. a better understanding of these host components will not only further our knowledge of cellular sorting processes but also help define the requirements for host factors in retrovirus assembly and release.
