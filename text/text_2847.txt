BACKGROUND
leptin and the leptin receptor  are involved in satiety and energy expenditure via central and peripheral mechanisms. the primary site of leptin action is the hypothalamus where the leptin receptor interacts with the adipocyte-derived leptin signal to regulate appetite, energy balance, and metabolism. leprs also regulate energy homeostasis in peripheral tissues including skeletal muscle, liver, pancreas, and adipose tissue. leptin prevents obesity via leprs by stimulating glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle and liver  <cit> , and inhibits insulin secretion of pancreatic Î²-cells  <cit> .

mutations and genetic variations of the lepr gene have been discovered in rodents and humans. sequencing-based detection of lepr mutations demonstrated that frame-shift or missense mutations of the lepr gene caused obesity, pituitary dysfunction, hyperphagia, or hypogonadism in humans  <cit> . in rodents, leptin receptor gene mutations resulted in obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and reduced fertility  <cit> . common genetic variants  at the lepr gene locus have been associated with obesity, hyperinsulinemia, type  <dig> diabetes mellitus , and variations in leptin levels in different populations. for example, three non-synonymous snps  have been evaluated for association studies  <cit> . therefore, most association studies of lepr polymorphisms have been performed on snps or deletion/insertion polymorphisms . however, the association of dna copy number variations  at the lepr gene locus with human diseases has not yet been reported.

in recent years, comprehensive human cnv maps were assembled using various experimental platforms  <cit> . while the growing number of genome-wide association data sets can be utilized to detect clinically-relevant cnvs, absolute copy number information cannot be easily determined by current quantitative assays, with the exception of fiber-fish. nonetheless, recent studies have shown that cnvs are implicated in human diseases including glomerulonephritis   <cit> , hiv-1/aids   <cit> , bipolar disorder and schizophrenia   <cit> , neoplasia   <cit> , psoriasis   <cit> , and myocardial infarction   <cit> .

RESULTS
on employing a candidate gene approach to the association study of cnvs with diabetes and metabolic traits, we targeted the genomic locus of the lepr gene encompassing approximately  <dig> kb of chromosome  <dig>  dna copy number analysis of the affymetrix  <dig> k snp array data showed that the korean population exhibited cnvs at the lepr gene locus . our qmpsf experiments generated continuous variables of dna copy number at the lepr locus for individuals . next, the experimental copy number information was transformed to dichotomized dna copy numbers  for cnv association studies. an appropriate copy number value  was then assigned to each individual using either male or female median copy number value among non-diabetic subjects  as the cutoff. the same cutoff value was used to dichotomize copy numbers among diabetes subjects in the nested case-control study. dna copy numbers were determined using only a short pcr fragment  of the entire lepr gene sequence. to address the question as to whether this short sequence was representative of the whole lepr gene, we investigated the cnv boundaries using pcr-based  and array-based  analyses. relative dna copy numbers were obtained by qmpsf using primers targeting several regions along the lepr gene sequence. qmpsf results showed that the copy number of the e <dig> dna sequence was correlated to that of the promoter-containing exon region at the lepr locus, but not to the other downstream exonic regions . on the other hand, cnv analysis of the affymetrix snp array  <dig>  data revealed that the whole lepr gene locus region was highly cnv-affected, with a varied length of cnv boundaries over the lepr gene sequence . this result indicated that the e <dig> dna copy number did not represent dna copy numbers of the whole lepr gene, but a partial dna sequence containing the leprot  gene at the lepr locus.

next, we tested the statistical significance of the association of the e <dig> dna copy number with metabolic traits. in male non-diabetic subjects, significant differences for some demographic characteristics were observed between low  and high  copy number individuals . fasting glucose and total cholesterol levels were higher in individuals with low copy numbers of the e <dig> dna at lepr gene locus in three different age groups of male individuals . the association of low copy numbers with higher levels of obesity-related phenotypes and total cholesterol levels remained significant in linear regression analysis with age-and bmi-adjustments followed by bonferroni correction for multiple testing among male individuals . among female subjects, e <dig> dna copy numbers were also associated with levels of fasting glucose and postprandial 2hr insulin. on the other hand, beneficial phenotypes for obesity-related traits and total cholesterol levels were associated with higher dna copy numbers  of the lepr gene locus in male subjects.

the copy numbers of the e <dig> dna sequence at the lepr gene locus were used in the nested case-control study of t2dm, in which subjects  were matched for age, sex, and bmi at a ratio of approximately 1: <dig> to control subjects . our case groups showed typical demographic characteristics to diabetes subjects . for example, diabetic case subjects had higher triglyceride, higher total cholesterol, and lower hdl-cholesterol than those levels in non-diabetic subjects. logistic regression analysis showed that low e <dig> dna copy numbers were associated with t2dm , with a significance of p <  <dig>  .

to study biological roles of the e <dig> dna copy numbers, we compared mrna expression levels of both lepr and leprot genes with e <dig> dna copy numbers in lymphoblastoid cell lines. the e <dig> dna sequence exists immediately downstream of the overlapped exon  <dig> of the lepr and leprot genes. real-time pcr analysis showed a significant negative correlation of the e <dig> dna copy number with the lepr transcript level , but a weak positive correlation with the leprot transcript level  . moreover, the lepr expression level was inversely correlated with the leprot expression level . this result suggests that higher copy numbers of the e <dig> dna may contribute to higher transcriptional activity of the leprot gene by gene dosage effect, which may be accordingly responsible for downregulation of lepr gene.

discussion
our candidate gene approach to cnv association studies identified the e <dig> dna copy number variation at the lepr gene locus, which was associated with metabolic traits and the risk of t2dm. lower copy numbers of the e <dig> dna were associated with higher fasting glucose in both male and female non-diabetic subjects. however, obesity-related traits and total cholesterol levels exhibited significant association with the e <dig> dna copy numbers only in male non-t2dm subjects whereas postprandial 2hr insulin level was significantly higher only in female non-t2dm subjects. these results suggest that the e <dig> dna copy number variations at the lepr gene locus may contribute to glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism in a different manner between male and female subjects.

in our cnv association study, we observed that the beneficial high e <dig> dna copy number was associated with lower fasting glucose levels  in both genders which are beneficial in terms of diabetes. similar results were reported for mouse models with lepr signaling defects  <cit> . for example, hypothalamus and pancreas-specific lepr signaling disruption led to fasting hypoglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia, highlighting the important role of beta cells in lepr mediated glucose homeostasis  <cit> . hypothalamic lepr kovmh mice fed a low fat diet also exhibited hypertriglyceridemia without concomitant hypercholesterolemia  <cit> . neuronal lepr deletion induces diabetic phenotypes such as body weight increase, adiposity, and hyperglycemia in proportion to hypothalamic lepr deficiency  <cit> . in addition, antisense-rna mediated adipocyte-specific reduction of lepr leads to decrease in lepr signaling, resulting in increased adipocyte, hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin resistance  <cit> . as presented in our association study, the high e <dig> copy number individuals shared similar phenotypes with lepr deficient animal models. moreover, human lepr signaling mutations also caused obesity as well as impairments of pubertal development and growth hormone secretion  <cit> . thus, it is conceivable that higher e <dig> dna copy numbers may result in a decrease in lepr signaling, which functions in a complex manner in different tissues.

indeed, our expression analysis of lepr gene in lcls showed that the high e <dig> dna copy number was significantly correlated with downregulation of the lepr gene and concomitant upregulation of the leprot gene. hypothalamic lepr mrna expression is indicative of functional lep-lepr signaling  <cit> . the lepr and leprot transcripts share the first two exons, which are not translated in the lepr gene  <cit> . among the lepr isoforms, the long form  is primarily expressed in specific nuclei of the hypothalamus, whereas the short isoform  is expressed in most tissues. these two isoforms of lepr have identical extracellular domains but differ in the length of their intracellular domains, which contributes to their different capacity for signal transduction  <cit> . on the other hand, our cnv analyses of the affymetrix snp array  <dig>  and qmpsf revealed a varied length of the cnv region at the lepr gene locus. also, we found that the e <dig> dna copy numbers did not represent dna copy numbers of the whole lepr gene but only a partial sequence containing leprot gene. thus, this finding suggests that e <dig> dna copy numbers may negatively regulate lepr gene expression through a gene dosage effect of leprot.

however, leprot overexpression decreases only cell surface expression of lepr without modifying the total amount of lepr  <cit> . in our study, the observed weak correlation of e <dig> dna copy numbers with lepr mrna levels in lcls might be ascribed to inappropriate selection of target tissues for lepr and leprot expression studies. thus, the correlation of high e <dig> dna copy number with leprot gene expression may be more significant in an appropriate lepr target tissues such as the hypothalamus, pancreatic Î²-cells, or adipocytes. elucidating tissue-specific regulation of lepr gene expression could explain the complex pattern of association of phenotypes with the e <dig> dna copy number variation. it remains to be investigated whether the e <dig> copy number confers a gene dosage effect of leprot on lepr signaling using an appropriate target tissue, and whether this occurs via either transcriptional regulation or intracellular transport of lepr. alternatively, the e <dig> dna sequence may merely play a role as a direct negative transcriptional regulatory sequence for the lepr gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
a prior cnv analysis of affymetrix  <dig> k snp and  <dig>  array chip data indicated the potential presence of cnvs at the lepr gene locus as well as a varied length of the cnv region. dna copy number measurements at the lepr gene locus and subsequent association studies revealed that lower copy numbers of the e <dig> dna sequence around leprot gene were associated with detrimental phenotypes of metabolic traits  as well as the risk of t2dm. in addition, the e <dig> dna copy number exhibited a negative correlation with lepr gene expression but a positive correlation with leprot gene expression. more research may be warranted to determine if leprot expression impacts lepr expression.
