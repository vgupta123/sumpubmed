BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that thrives in a variety of environments. the ability of p. aeruginosa to adapt to different niches and establish both chronic and acute infections requires differential gene expression and phenotypic alterations ultimately coordinated by global regulators  <cit>  and small non-coding regulatory rnas   <cit> . the csr/rsm system is a regulatory network that is comprised of global rna-binding regulators and srnas that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. the csr/rsm system, conserved in both gram-negative and -positive bacteria, can impact both positively and negatively on the abundance of over 20 % of all mrna, and controls a large variety of physiological processes  .

rsma, a member of the extensive family of csra homologs firstly described in e. coli, is an rna-binding regulator that impacts the mrna levels of 9 % of the genome of pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . unlike other bacterial genera, pseudomonas spp. have all been found to encode multiple rsma homologs, including the redundant rsme of p. protegens cha <dig> and the rsmn paralogue of p. aeruginosa . these homologs are directly regulated by rsma, induced under various conditions, differ in sequence, secondary and tertiary structure, and have various rna-binding affinities and specificities. collectively, these rsma homologs have overlapping and unique roles to fine-tune post-transcriptional gene regulation in pseudomonas.

generally, rsma negatively regulates mrna targets by binding to sites containing critical gga motifs present in the 5’-untranslated region  of the mrna which impedes translation initiation or effects mrna stability and turnover  <cit> . rsma represses regulons necessary for establishing chronic infections including type vi secretion systems , exopolysaccharide production, biofilm formation, and iron homeostasis  <cit> . rsma positively and indirectly regulates acute infection phenotypes through modulation of intracellular signaling networks , regulatory factors including genes associated with surface motility, type iii secretion systems , and type iv pili, as well as systems that operate through the camp/virulence factor regulator  route .

rsma’s regulation, resulting in the switch from planktonic  to biofilm  phenotypes, is ultimately cued by environmental signals recognized by three sensor kinases, gacs, rets and lads. rets and lads integrate these signals through repression or activation of the gaca/gacs two component regulatory system, respectively  <cit> . the environmental signals that influence this pathway are still mostly unknown, however tca cycle intermediates and temperature are thought to play a role  <cit> . the gac system antagonizes rsma by inducing the transcription of redundant antagonist srnas, including rsmy and rsmz in p. aeruginosa and rsmx, rsmy, and rsmz, in p. protegens cha <dig> and p. syringae pv. tomato dc <dig> . interestingly, multiple homologous copies of rsmx exist in p. syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  p. syringae b728a, p. syringae 1448a, p. mendocina ymp, and p. stutzeri a <dig>  <cit> . these small rnas all have a secondary structure with numerous unpaired gga motifs that act to sequester rsma proteins from their targets  <cit> .

the multiple small non-coding rnas  are thought to provide a dosage effect to help direct expression of specific rsma/rsmn regulons. even though these srnas are redundant, their transcriptions are, however, differentially regulated by a number of auxiliary factors which vary between them and between pseudomonas species  <cit> . the architecture of the rsm srna promoters is more complex than most bacterial promoters. promoters of rsmx, rsmy, and rsmz all contain an 18 bp upstream activating sequence  that is essential for their activation by the response regulator, gaca . however, in the absence of gaca in p. aeruginosa transcription of rsmy and rsmz is still achieved but to a lesser degree, suggesting the involvement of additional regulatory pathways  <cit> . in p. aeruginosa, mvat and mvau, global regulators and members of the histone-like nucleoid- structuring  family of proteins, bind to an a + t rich region upstream of rsmz to silence expression  <cit> . however, in p. protegens two recognition sites at the a + t region of the rsmz promoter are bound by integration host factor ; also a global regulator of the h-ns family. due to the regulatory mechanisms of ihf, this suggests that dna bending and temperature influence rsmz transcription  <cit> . in p. protegens strains cha <dig> and pf- <dig>  psra, a transcriptional activator of rpos and repressor of fatty acid degradation, directly activates rsmz expression  <cit> .

each rsm srna is distinct, as demonstrated by differences in their temporal expression and mechanisms for turnover and stability. in p. aeruginosa rsmy transcription increases in parallel throughout cell growth, whereas rsmz is induced sharply during the late exponential growth phase  <cit> . however, after 24 h of growth, rsmz transcripts are degraded in p. aeruginosa  <cit>  and interestingly, need to be eliminated before a biofilm can form.  <cit>  under biofilm growth conditions in p. aeruginosa rsmz is degraded by cafa, a ribonuclease g activated by the two component system, bfisr  <cit> . expression of rsmy is negatively regulated through a phosphorelay event involving three sensor kinases  and htpb   <cit> . rsmy is positively regulated by the srna chaperone, hfq, which binds and stabilizes the rsmy transcript  <cit> . taken together, there are both similar and unique mechanisms regulating these rsm srnas.

focusing on a specific rsm srna and comparing it among different pseudomonas species demonstrates similarities and differences in that srna’s expression patterns, regulators contributing to their transcription, stability/degradation mechanisms, and affinities for the different rsma homologs. regardless of the srna’s designation , multiple rsm srnas allow for the ability to steer, amplify, and/or fine-tune a response appropriate for each pseudomonas species under different environmental niches.

this study demonstrates overlapping but unique aspects of a newly discovered rsmy/rsmz-type of regulatory rna analog in p. aeruginosa. due to the unique sequence of this rna having no homology with previously described rsm regulatory rnas, we have designated it rsmw.

RESULTS
rsmw is upregulated under biofilm growth and appears to be processed out from upstream gene, pa4570
we sought to discover srnas important for biofilm growth in p. aeruginosa. thus, samples grown for 24 h under drip-flow biofilm and planktonic growth conditions were harvested. large  and small  rna fractions were collected and analyzed using custom rna sequencing  to optimize for small rnas. gomez-lozano et al.  <cit> , who also performed rna-seq of small rna species in p. aeruginosa, detected and originally named rsmw as pant <dig>  with 5118198- <dig>  coordinates  <cit> . in our study, rsmw was upregulated approximately 21- and 10-fold in biofilm versus planktonic conditions based on rna-seq and qrt-pcr, respectively . similar to ferrara et al.  <cit> , a custom algorithm was used to categorize the detected small rnas into intergenic, intragenic, 5′-utr, 3′-utr, and antisense srnas  <cit> . rsmw was categorized as a 3’-utr of the 224 bp open reading frame  pa4570; however, the rna-seq mapping profile demonstrated higher levels of rsmw compared to pa <dig>  suggesting either independent transcription or a processing event and higher stability of the rsmw rna compared to the pa <dig> mrna.fig.  <dig> rsmw is upregulated under biofilm growth in p. aeruginosa. a rna sequencing read mapping showing the genome region and levels of the predicted small rna  during biofilm  and planktonic  growth states and from libraries prepared conventionally  and adapted for small rna retention . rpkm  were calculated for each small rna to compare levels between conditions. rsmw was upregulated approximately 21- and 10-fold in biofilm versus planktonic conditions based on rna-seq and qrt-pcr, respectively . rsmw was categorized as the 3’-untranslated region  of gene pa <dig> because it was less than  <dig> nucleotides apart from this open reading frame. b northern blot analyses reveal two bands for rsmw. rna  from p. aeruginosa grown under planktonic or drip-flow biofilm conditions was run on denaturing glyoxal agarose gel , blotted, probed with radiolabeled riboprobes complementary to rsmw, and exposed for 1 hour . hybridization bands of approximately  <dig> bases in planktonic and biofilm growth conditions and an additional band of approximately  <dig> bases in biofilm conditions are revealed. lanes: mw, molecular weight ladder in number of bases;  <dig> ) planktonic conditions;  <dig> ) drip-flow biofilm conditions. abbreviations: bf <dig>  bf2: biofilm replicates; p <dig>  p2: planktonic replicates; sem: standard error of the mean



to determine if rsmw was an independent transcript, we performed northern blot using a probe complementary to rsmw . a band approximately of  <dig> bases was revealed in both planktonic and biofilm growth conditions, however an additional band approximately  <dig> bases was present in biofilm growth conditions. these results suggest possible co-transcription of pa <dig> and rsmw. analysis using ribosome binding site calculator v  <dig>   <cit>  indicates that rsmw rna is unlikely to be translated because typical rates of translation were absent using all possible start codons.

rsmw in silico analyses suggests its involvement in rsma regulation
using 5’ rlm-race and rna-seq we determined the exact rsmw coordinates and predicted its secondary structure using mfold  <cit> . the secondary structure highly resembles the small srnas, rsmz and rsmy. rsmw contains  <dig> gga motifs of which  <dig> are exposed in the single-stranded outer stem loops, suggesting its involvement and binding to rsma . to further verify that rsmw is an rsmy/rsmz-type of srna, we searched for potential binding sites for regulatory elements, such as gaca, a known activator of rsmy and rsmz, using virtual footprint, an algorithm for regulon prediction in prokaryotes  <cit> . transcriptional activation of rsmy and rsmz by gaca requires a gaca binding site . there is a weakly homologous gaca binding site approximately 830 bp upstream of rsmw . this is farther upstream than is the case for rsmy and rsmz promoters, where the gaca sites are located -75 bp and -196 bp upstream, respectively  <cit> .fig.  <dig> 
in silico analyses suggests rsmw involvement in rsma regulation. a secondary structure prediction of rsmw. using mfold and sequence based on 5’ rlm-race and rna sequencing reveals that  <dig> out of  <dig> gga motifs can be located on outer stem loops, patterns reminiscent of that of the small regulatory rnas rsmx, rsmy and rsmz, thus suggesting rsmw’s role in binding/sequestering the global regulator rsma. transcription of rsmy and rsmz require gaca binding to upstream activating sequence . there is a weakly conserved gaca binding motif approximately 830 bp upstream of rsmw. b promoter analysis of rsmw. virtual footprint/prodoric predictions  suggests binding sites and regulation of rsmw by rhlr, fur, and ihf . a conserved σ <dig>  <dig> site but not a - <dig> site appear upstream of rsmw within the pa <dig> open reading frame . a - <dig> site 58 bp upstream of the 5’end of rsmw is predicted to overlap with a binding site for the heat shock sigma factor rpoh. directly downstream of the - <dig> site is a putative ihf binding site, 46 bp upstream of the rsmw 5’end. the rlm-race predicted 5’end of rsmw is indicated with + <dig> and arrow. the first nucleotide of the start codons of the open reading frames are indicated with a downward arrow. transcriptional terminator of ispb gene, upstream of pa <dig>  is indicated in bold. no transcriptional terminator can be predicted between pa <dig> and rsmw




in silico promoter analyses suggests that under unique circumstances involving temperature and ihf binding protein, rsmw may be independently transcribed from pa <dig> . a - <dig> site appears upstream of rsmw and within the pa <dig> coding region. this - <dig> site is predicted to be overlapped by a binding site for rpoh, a heat shock sigma factor. directly downstream of the - <dig> site is a putative ihf binding site. ihf has been shown to bind in response to temperature, binds to bent dna, can create an open complex for rna polymerase, and can promote transcription without the aid of other transcription factors . on the other hand, the absence of any apparent transcription terminator following pa <dig> supports co-transcription of rsmw and pa <dig>  other potential regulatory elements of rsmw and/or pa <dig> indicated in silico include rhlr , fur , algu , fleq  and glpr  .

rsmw levels increase in response to increasing temperature
temperature is known to influence the expression of rsm srnas in other pseudomonads  <cit> , therefore we wanted to determine the effect of temperature on rsmw levels. using qrt-pcr we demonstrated that when p. aeruginosa pao <dig> was grown at 37 °c versus 28 °c, rsmw levels increased approximately 5-fold, pa <dig> levels increased 2-fold, and interestingly, rsma levels decreased, although modestly,  <dig> -fold . therefore, the heat responsive transcriptional regulatory elements  seem likely contributors to the increased mrna levels of rsmw at higher temperatures.

rsmw expression is elevated in minimal medium, in stationary phase, and in both, gaca and rhlr mutants
considering the regulatory sites predicted in silico upstream of rsmw and our observations that rsmw was upregulated under biofilm versus planktonic conditions, we identified other factors regulating rsmw transcription in pao <dig> grown at both logarithmic  and late stationary  growth phases, and in minimal  versus nutrient-rich  media . to further define the promoter requirements for rsmw, we assessed two chromosomally-integrated, transcriptional lacz fusions. pao1 + rsmws-lacz strain contained the first transcriptional fusion with a region consisting of the upstream gene, pa <dig>  225 bp upstream of rsmw. a second transcriptional fusion consisting of  <dig>  bp upstream of rsmw, including pa <dig> and 1107 bp upstream of pa <dig>  was chromosomally integrated into pao <dig> creating pao1 + rsmwl-lacz . results were normalized by subtracting the od <dig> of a control parental strain with an empty integrated construct . our results demonstrated negligible β-galactosidase activity from the rsmws-lacz fusion, suggesting that this region was insufficient to drive rsmw transcription. however, the longer reporter fusion demonstrated that rsmw was up-transcribed approximately 3-fold more in late stationary versus logarithmic growth phase in pb minimal media . furthermore, rsmw was upregulated approximately 2-fold more in pb late stationary cultures compared to lb late stationary cultures . however, there was no difference in reporter expression levels in lb media comparing logarithmic to late stationary cultures. all in all, production of rsmw is induced in minimal media after 16 h of growth .fig.  <dig> rsmw transcription is elevated in stationary phase and in gaca and rhlr deficient backgrounds. p. aeruginosa strains were grown in 5 ml cultures at 37 °c with 250 rpm shaking. aliquots were processed and placed in a 96-well microtiter plate for absorbance readings at 420 nm as previously described by griffith et al.  <cit> . the y-axis unit represents β-galactosidase activity normalized by od <dig> nm of the cultures. to account for leaky expression or background noise arising from the strains or fusion system β-galactosidase activity from experimental strains was subtracted from a parental strain harboring an empty transcriptional fusion construct. all numbers indicate the average of three independent experiments. error bars indicate mean ± standard error . a schematic representation of transcriptional fusions integrated into the chromosomes of wild-type and rhlr and gaca transposon mutants. b rsmw transcription is elevated in minimal media during stationary growth phase. p. aeruginosa strains were grown in minimal  or nutrient rich  media and samples at mid-logarithmic  and stationary phase  were analyzed for lacz expression using both the rsmws-lacz and rsmwl-lacz fusions. c rsmw transcription is elevated 2-fold in rhlr transposon mutant in minimal media during stationary growth phase. p. aeruginosa rhlr transposon mutants were grown in minimal  or nutrient rich  media and samples at stationary phase  were collected and analyzed using the rsmwl-lacz fusion. d rsmw transcription is induced 27-fold in gaca transposon mutant. p. aeruginosa gaca transposon mutants grown in minimal  media at mid-logarithmic  and stationary phase  were analyzed using the rsmwl-lacz fusion. abbreviations: log ; on )



as suggested by our in silico promoter prediction analysis for rsmw, rhlr may contribute to the regulation of rsmw expression. therefore, the rsmwl-lacz transcriptional fusion was chromosomally integrated into an rhlr transposon mutant  creating rhlr::isphoa + rsmwl-lacz. our results demonstrate that in the absence of rhlr in 16-h growth cultures, rsmw is upregulated approximately 2-fold, but only in pb minimal medium, not in lb, suggesting that rhlr may serve as a repressor of rsmw expression under minimal nutrient conditions .

since rsmy and rsmz are both transcriptionally activated by gaca we wanted to see if rsmw relied on gaca for transcriptional activation. the gaca transposon mutant  with the rsmwl-lacz transcriptional fusion demonstrated that rsmw transcription is increased 27-fold in the absence of gaca in pb minimal medium at 16 h, suggesting that the mechanism of induction occurs only after the culture has reached stationary phase . in contrast to rsmy and rsmz in p. aeruginosa  <cit> , gaca appears to directly or indirectly repress rsmw expression.

rsmw can replace the functions of rsmy and rsmz
we wanted to determine if rsmw could function in place of rsmy and rsmz in p. aeruginosa. therefore, we overexpressed rsmw in pasc <dig>  strain deleted in both, rsmy and rsmz genes, and assessed whether rsmw could restore the phenotypes of this ∆rsmyz double mutant to wild-type levels. using the 5’ end predicted by rlm-race, rsmw was overexpressed from a plasmid transcribing it from a constitutive tac promoter.

the Δrsmyz double mutant produces less biofilm compared to the pao1-n parental wild-type strain. compared to the Δrsmyz mutant alone, the Δrsmwyz triple mutant was further impaired for biofilm production. this impairment was restored by complementing rsmw back in this strain in cis  . the Δrsmyz double mutant overexpressing rsmw  demonstrated restored and increased biofilm levels compared to wild-type. interestingly, overexpression of rsmw in the wild-type  also increased biofilm production. our results demonstrate that rsmw may compensate for the loss of rsmy and rsmz and promote biofilm formation.fig.  <dig> complementation of ∆rsmyz mutant by rsmw. a overexpression of rsmw restores and increases biofilm production. assessment of biofilms was performed using  <dig>  % crystal violet staining method in 96-well microtiter plates after 24 hour of culture incubation at 37 °c in lb. an od <dig> nm reading was taken and the average of  <dig> experiments is shown with standard error depicted. b rsmw expressed in a ∆rsmyz mutant background decreases swarming phenotype. swarming motility assay demonstrated in p. aeruginosa strains after 24 hour incubation at 37 °c. the ∆rsmyz mutant expressing rsmw from an overexpression plasmid  has pigmentation colors more resembling wild-type compared to the ∆rsmyz mutant carrying an empty plasmid. strains: pao1-n wild-type ; rsmw-deficient strain ; rsmy- and rsmz-deficient strain ; rsmw-, rsmy- and rsmz-deficient strain ; ∆rsmwyz strain with wt rsmw region swapped back in cis ; wt strain carrying empty overexpression plasmid ; wt strain carrying plasmid overexpressing rmsw ; ∆rsmyz strain carrying empty overexpression plasmid ; ∆rsmyz strain carrying plasmid overexpressing rsmw 



the Δrsmyz double mutant is a rapid swarmer compared to the wild-type strain, where all cells reach the edges of the petri dish faster. however, the Δrsmyz mutant overexpressing rsmw demonstrated a reduction in swarming . swarming differences between the Δrsmwyz and Δrsmyz mutant and between Δrsmw and wild-type were not apparent in this assay . taken together, rsmw appears to partially complement for the loss of rsmy and rsmz in regards to their contributions to swarming.

rsmw binds rsma in vitro
rsma binds rsmy and rsmz at sites containing gga motifs  <cit> . due to the numerous gga motifs present in rsmw we determined if rsmw could bind rsma specifically and with high affinity. in vitro rna binding assays were performed with recombinant rsma and rsmw generated by in vitro transcription. incubations with  <dig>  pmol  of rsmw with increasing concentrations of rsma yielded one or two shifted bands demonstrating rsmw-rsma complexes . as has been suggested with rsmy  <cit>  and demonstrated with rsmz  <cit> , we speculate that the presence of multiple bands is the result of multiple rsma proteins binding to the different sites containing the gga motifs.fig.  <dig> rsma specifically binds to rsmw with high affinity. electrophoresis mobility shift assay between rsma and rsmw was carried out by synthesizing rsmw in vitro with t <dig> rna polymerase. the fluorescently labeled rsmw  was incubated in the absence  or presence of increasing concentrations of rsma , and in the presence of unlabeled specific competitor rna, rsmw   or unlabeled competitor rna, rsmy  . from these results the dissociation constant  between rsma and rsmw was determined to be  <dig> ±  <dig> nm



competition assays were carried out and demonstrated that rsmw binds specifically to rsma as addition of unlabeled rsmw resulted in a downshift . interestingly, addition of unlabeled rsmy competitor at the same concentration was only able to partially relieve the binding of rsmw with rsma because two upshifted bands were still evident under these conditions . sonnleitner et al.  <cit>  demonstrated a weaker binding affinity of rsmy for rsma   <cit>  than we observed with rsmw for rsma .

even though the experimental design between sonnleitner et al.  <dig> and the present study have differences, taken together, rsmw appears to have higher affinity for rsma than rsmy. rsmw has  <dig> gga motifs like rsmy, but higher affinity could result from where the gga motifs are localized in the secondary structure, or influences by neighboring secondary structures and nucleotides.

rsma regulates pa <dig> and rsmw transcript levels and possible regulation of rsmw by hfq
the lack of a transcriptional terminator between pa <dig> and rsmw suggest that both co-transcribed. we hypothesize this co-transcript is bound by rsma through the rsmw moiety, resulting in changes in the co-transcript’s stability or processing. to determine the contributions of rsma on the transcript levels of pa <dig> and rsmw, we utilized the conditional rsma strain pask <dig>  <cit> , which is deficient of rsma when grown in the absence of inducer and in which rsma can be induced by the addition of iptg. the rsmw and pa <dig> mrna levels were assessed by quantitative rt-pcr in pask <dig> grown in lb with and without iptg and at both mid-logarithmic and late stationary growth phases . pa <dig> transcript levels increased 26-fold, whereas rsmw levels decreased 2-fold in pask <dig> grown in the presence of iptg compared to pask <dig> grown without iptg at mid-logarithmic growth phase . there was no effect on pa <dig> or rsmw rna levels in cultures grown to late stationary phase . these results demonstrate that in logarithmic growth rsma increases pa <dig> mrna levels and decreases rsmw levels.

we hypothesize that rsmw may be stabilized and positively regulated by the small rna chaperone hfq, similar to rsmy. therefore, rsmw rna levels were assessed in an hfq-deficient strain by qrt-pcr. small regulatory rna prrf <dig> and rsmz were used as a positive and negative control, respectively. rsmw levels decreased by a modest 2-fold in an hfq-deficient strain compared to wild-type, suggesting a possible role of hfq in stabilization of rsmw .

characterization of pa <dig> and similarities to rsmn and rsma
due to a possible linkage of pa <dig> and rsmw, we characterized pa <dig>  interestingly, sequence and genomic topology similarities between rsmn, rsma, and pa <dig> suggest that pa <dig> might be another rsma/n homolog . specifically, sequence alignment demonstrated that pa <dig> has 17 % identity and 51 % similarity to rsmn and 16 % identity and 49 % similarity to rsma. pa <dig> is predicted to translate into a protein of  <dig> amino acids, similar to rsmn  and rsma . also, pa <dig> has many basic residues  similar to rsma  and rsmn . pa4570’s basic residues and region of highest conservation are within the two regions known to be involved in rna binding by the csr/rsm homolog proteins . l <dig> and r <dig> residues are important for rsme binding to the hcna 5′-utr  <cit> . in pa <dig>  l <dig> is conserved, but r <dig> is replaced with a conservative substitution of a lysine  .fig.  <dig> pa <dig>  upstream of rsmw, resembles an rsma/rsmn homolog. a similarities in gene topology between rsmn and pa <dig> upstream of rsmw. b primary sequence alignment of p. aeruginosa rsma, rsmn, and pa <dig> demonstrating sequence similarities. rsmn and rsma has 64 % similarity and 31 % identity in sequence. rsmn and pa <dig> has 51 % similarity and 17 % identity in sequence. rsma and pa <dig> has 49 % similarity and  <dig>  % identity in sequence. conservation stringency of residues is depicted using symbols below.  single, fully conserved residue;  conservation of strong groups;  conservation of weak groups. l <dig> and r <dig> residues important for rsme binding to hcna 5’-utr are fully and strongly conserved in pa <dig>  respectively, and indicated in bold. boxes indicate region  <dig> and region  <dig> of csra, rsma, and rsme homologs thought to mediate rna binding



due to this sequence homology, we wanted to see if pa <dig> could complement for rsma, thus pa <dig> or pa <dig> together with rsmw were overexpressed in a p. aeruginosa ∆rsma mutant strain. the ∆rsma mutant forms robust biofilms and is defective for swarming. overexpressing both pa <dig> with rsmw or pa <dig> alone could not restore the ∆rsma mutant to a wild-type phenotype . we also wanted to look if pa <dig> could complement csra, the rsma homolog of e. coli that inhibits glycogen synthesis  <cit> . heterologous overexpression of pa <dig> in a wild-type e. coli had no effect on glycogen production, as indicated by no apparent change in colony streak color after iodine staining . interestingly, e. coli heterologously overexpressing pa <dig> with rsmw or rsmw alone showed an increase in glycogen accumulation and supports that rsmw can serve as a srna antagonist of e. coli’s csra.

our data suggests that although pa <dig> may show sequence homology to rsma/n homologs, it does not appear to be a functional equivalent to these homologs.

discussion
rsmw
many pseudomonas species harbor three types of rsm riboregulators , however until now p. aeruginosa has been shown to have only rsmy and rsmz. interestingly, some pseudomonas species can carry up to five rsmx homologs  <cit> . the reason behind having so many rsm riboregulators is still unclear but suggests their importance for increasing the dynamic nature and robustness of the rsm regulatory network and for providing specificity and phenotypic diversity required for the various pseudomonas species and their unique niches. we disclose rsmw, another rsm srna, but which is unique in many ways.

many studies have shown that 3’-utrs serve as genomic reservoirs for regulatory srnas  <cit> , and unlike rsmz and rsmy which are independently transcribed from promoter elements, rsmw appears to be processed out from the 3’-utr of pa <dig>  a hypothetical orf of 224 bp. aside from the - <dig> and - <dig> site upstream of pa <dig>  a - <dig> site 58 bp upstream of rsmw was predicted in silico. however, lack of an apparent - <dig> site, absence of a terminator between pa <dig> and rsmw, and our transcription studies which demonstrated that rsmw could not be expressed independently of the upstream gene promoter elements, suggests that pa <dig> and rsmw make up one transcriptional unit.

compared to rsmy and rsmz, production of rsmw is induced under different conditions. our work and wurtzel et al.  <cit>  demonstrate that higher temperatures  positively affect the expression and levels of rsmw, but in contrast higher temperatures had much less of an effect on rsmy and rsmz expression. interestingly, the aforementioned - <dig> site, 58 bp upstream of rsmw, is predicted to be bound by the heat responsive sigma factor, rpoh. immediately downstream of this - <dig> site is a predicted ihf binding site. ihf also binds to dna in response to temperature  <cit> . many studies show that temperature regulates rsm srna expression  <cit> . the fact that rsmw levels are increased at higher temperatures and rsmw is conserved in the opportunistic human pathogen p. aeruginosa and not in the other pseudomonads provides a unique mechanism for fine-tuning the rsm regulatory circuit specific for p. aeruginosa.

rsmw expression patterns vary from those of rsmz in p. aeruginosa. we showed that rsmw is upregulated in stationary phase growth and 24 h biofilms compared to mid-logarithmic growth phase and that overexpression of rsmw enhances biofilm development. in contrast, rsmz rna is absent from stationary phase cells after 24 h  <cit> . studies also show that biofilm development requires reduced levels of rsmz, but not rsmy; and overexpression of rsmz is sufficient to arrest biofilm formation  <cit> . overall, our studies suggest that enhancement of biofilm formation by rsmw is due to its direct interactions with rsma.

levels of rsmw are regulated differently from rsmy and rsmz because rsmw is not transcriptionally activated by gaca. based on our transcriptional reporter studies, gaca appears to have a negative effect on rsmw transcription, demonstrating another scenario where rsmw can be induced under conditions unique from rsmy and rsmz. in yersinia pseudotuberculosis, the gaca/gacs system  activates transcription of only one of the two csra antagonist srnas, csrb  <cit> . expression of the second srna, csrc, is activated by the phoq/phop two component system  <cit> . an rhlr binding site predicted in silico upstream of rsmw suggested a possible activational mechanism for rsmw. however, our transcriptional studies suggest that rhlr represses rsmw expression because rsmw expression is upregulated in an rhlr transposon mutant in late stationary phase in minimal media. nevertheless, rhlr regulation is dynamic and rhlr can serve as both an activator  <cit>  and a repressor  <cit> . rhlr expression is upregulated under late stationary growth phases  <cit> , in nitrogen and phosphate limiting conditions  <cit> , and in mature 3-day-old biofilms  <cit> ; a pattern reminiscent of rsmw expression. therefore, rhlr regulation of rsmw may be multifactorial and induction of rsmw transcription by rhlr may occur under conditions not tested in our study. collectively, the unique expression patterns and regulation of rsmw implies a specific role for rsmw in the rsma/rsmn regulatory network.

pa4570
previous transcriptional studies demonstrated that the regulon of rsma in pseudomonas spp. is smaller than expected when comparing to the csra regulon in other bacteria  <cit> . a recent discovery that pseudomonas harbors another rsma homolog, rsmn, helped explain this by expanding the number of targets controlled by the system  <cit> . even though pa <dig> was unable to complement for rsma or csra in terms of glycogen metabolism, swarming, and biofilm production , this protein may still be a distant homolog of rsma or rsmn. pa <dig> may have been horizontally acquired or come from a gene duplication of rsma or rsmn and over time acquired mutations making it dysfunctional or highly specialized. feasibly, our experiments may not be suitable to recapitulate the conditions necessary to reveal pa4570’s function in the rsma/rsmn regulon.

nevertheless, pa4570’s linkage to rsmw and in silico similarities to rsma and rsmn provides thought-inducing evidence of its role as an rsma/rsmn homolog. pa <dig> shares a sequence similarity with the homologs comparable to what rsma shares with rsmn, and it maintains the conservation with the homologs across the rna-binding region and with known critical residues.

in pseudomonas spp. the rsm system functions with many rsma homologs, comprised of various affinities for both their targets and srna inhibitors, and coordinates events as a result of stoichiometric shifts. if pa <dig> is an rsma/rsmn homolog we propose a model where pa <dig> and rsmw are linked to help regulate the stoichiometric shift and possibly expand the regulon . interestingly, the regulatory linkage between pa <dig> and rsmw can be examined by assessing our rna-seq study . rna sequencing results of the Δrsmw mutant compared to wild-type demonstrated that pa <dig> was also down-regulated approximately 3-fold. it is possible that deleting the 3’-utr of pa <dig> may affect the overall transcript stability making it difficult to determine if the changes in gene expression are due to pa <dig> or rsmw. however, we do not believe that it is mere coincidence that many of the genes differentially expressed are part of the rsma regulon and were expressed in a pattern indicative of an alleviation of repression of rsma presumably by the absence of rsmw. so on the other hand, pa <dig> may have no function other than to regulate rsmw production, where rsmw activation and maturation occurs after it is processed out from the pa4570-rsmw transcript, a mechanism similar to the recently discovered nitrogen responsive srna, nrsz, in p. aeruginosa  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, rsmw is a rsm srna that is upregulated in p. aeruginosa grown in nutrient-limiting conditions, biofilms, and at higher temperatures. unlike rsmy and rsmz, rsmw is not transcriptionally activated by gaca and rsmw appears to be processed out from the 3’-utr of pa <dig>  our study is the first characterization of the hypothetical orf, pa <dig>  and further unravels the complexities of the global gac/rsm system that provides adaptive post-transcriptional modulations of gene expression in pseudomonas species.
