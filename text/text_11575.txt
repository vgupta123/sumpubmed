BACKGROUND
sesame  is an oil crop that contributes to the daily oil and protein requirements of almost half of the world’s population  <cit> . it is a high nutritive value crop thanks to its oil quality and quantity ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  %  <cit> . it was reported that sesame contain much compounds that benefit to human health, including antioxidant, antiaging, antihypertensive, anticancer, cholesterol lowering and antimutagenic properties . the global demand for vegetable oils is growing and estimated to reach  <dig> million tons by  <dig>  <cit> . sesame is therefore a productive plant which may greatly contribute to meet this demand. however to reach this objective, it is important to alleviate the different constraints that impair the crop productivity. water deficit or drought considered to be one of the greatest abiotic factors that limit global food production  <cit>  is significantly affecting 64 % of the global land area  <cit> . drought is one of the major constraints of sesame production especially because it is mainly grown in arid and semi-arid regions where the occurrence of drought is frequent  <cit> . the crop is highly sensitive to drought during its vegetative stage and its yield is adversely affected by water scarcity . in addition, the negative effect of drought stress on the sesame oil quality has been reported .

osmotic stresses including drought induce a cascade of molecular responses in plants. many stress-responsive genes are expressed differentially to adapt to unfavorable environmental conditions. induction of stress-related genes occurs mainly at the transcriptional level. the modification of the temporal and spatial expression patterns of the specific stress-related genes is an important part of the plant stress response  <cit> . transcription factors  act as regulatory proteins by regulating in a synchronized manner a set of targeted genes under their control and consequently enhance the stress tolerance of the plant. among these transcription factors, the ap2/erf superfamily constitutes one of the biggest gene families, which contains a typical ap <dig> dna-binding domain and is widely present in plants  <cit> . the ap2/erf superfamily is involved in response to drought, to high-salt content, to temperature change, to disease resistance, in flowering control pathway and has been analyzed by a combination of genetic and molecular approaches  <cit> .

according to the classification of sakuma et al.   <cit>  and later on adopted by several authors , ap2/erf superfamily includes five subfamilies:  ap <dig> ,  dreb ,  rav ,  erf , and  other proteins , based on the number of ap2/erf domains and the presence of other dna binding domains. while the ap <dig> family contains two repeated ap2/erf domains, the erf and dreb subfamilies contain a single ap2/erf domain  <cit> . the rav family contains a single ap2/erf domain and a specific b <dig> motif  <cit> . the extensive genomic studies of the ap2/erf superfamily in arabidopsis  <cit> , poplar  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , rice  <cit> , grape  <cit> , cucumber  <cit> , hevea  <cit> , castor bean  <cit> , chinese cabbage  <cit> , foxtail millet  <cit> , salix arbutifolia  <cit>  and eucalyptus grandis  <cit>  have provided a better understanding of these tfs. this gene family is highly conserved in plant species although number of gene, functional groups, and gene function could differ according to the species, as a result of independent and different evolution processes. there are many evidences of implication of ap2/erf genes especially drebs in drought stress responses in crops  <cit> . in arabidopsis, dreb2a and dreb2b are reported to be induced by dehydration . the soybean gmdreb <dig> protein has also been reported to promote the expression of downstream genes to enhance drought tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis  <cit> .

the lack of gene resources associated with drought tolerance hinders genetic improvement in sesame  <cit> . the recent advances on the sesame genome sequence and the identification of its complement of  <dig>  have brought sesame genome research into the functional genomics age  <cit> . this makes possible genome-wide analysis to find out valuable genes linked to important traits such as drought and to support sesame-breeding programs.

since little is known about the important ap2/erf superfamily in sesame, here, we described these tfs and analysed the potential role of dreb subfamily in responses to drought stress. this study will pave the way for the comprehensive analysis and the understanding of the biological roles of ap2/erf genes in sesame towards the improvement of drought stress tolerance.

RESULTS
identification and chromosomal location of the ap2/erf gene superfamily
a total of  <dig> ap2/erf genes were confirmed in sesame with complete ap2-type dna-binding domains ranging from  <dig> to 5837 bp in length . these genes represent about  <dig>  % of the total number of genes in sesame. based on the nature and the number of dna-binding domains, they were further divided into four major families namely ap <dig>  erf, dreb and rav. twenty genes were predicted to encode proteins containing double-repeated ap2/erf domains . four genes were predicted to encode single ap2/erf domain, together with one b <dig> domain . one hundred and two genes were predicted to encode proteins containing single ap2/erf domain  including  <dig> genes assigned to the erf subfamily and  <dig> genes assigned to the dreb subfamily. out of the remaining six genes, four genes  encoded single ap2/erf domain distinct from those of the members of the erf family but were more closely related to those of the ap <dig> family members. thus these four genes were then assigned to the ap <dig> family. finally, the last two genes  also contained single ap <dig> domain which showed a low similarity with the ap <dig> and erf families. it was found that they have a high similarity with the amino acid sequence of the arabidopsis gene “at4g13040” classified as “soloist”. therefore, these genes were designated as “soloist”.table  <dig> classification of the ap2/erf superfamily in sesame

the names of families, subfamilies and groups were previously reported by sakuma et al.  <cit> 



cumulatively, the number of ap2/erf genes in sesame is slightly lower than the five relative species analyzed: arabidopsis   <cit> , grape   <cit> , u. gibba   <cit> , tomato   <cit>  and potato   <cit> . as described for these species relatives, erf and ap <dig> families were also overrepresented in the sesame genome. arabidopsis and sesame have three and two “soloist” genes respectively while the other four species have only one “soloist” gene in their genomes. the fig.  <dig> summarizes the ap2/erf superfamily members detected in grape, tomato, potato, arabidopsis, utricularia gibba and sesame.fig.  <dig> phylogeny of the six species and repartition of the ap2/erf families



the localization of the ap2/erf genes revealed that they are distributed unevenly distributed on the  <dig> linkage groups . the precise position  of each ap2/erf on the sesame lgs is detailed in additional file  <dig>  six genes  were not mapped because they were located on the unanchored scaffolds . the largest number of genes  was found on lg <dig>  whereas lg <dig> and lg <dig> have only one gene . the two “soloist” genes were mapped on the same lg <dig> . the distribution pattern of these genes on some lgs pointed out some regions with relatively high accumulation of ap2/erf genes in cluster. this can be observed in the lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig>  in overall, each lg had a mixture of the different families except lg <dig> and lg <dig> which only contained erf genes.table  <dig> summary of the ap2/erf genes identified in the sesame genome

phylogenetic analysis and mapping of orthologous genes
two maximum likelihood  trees were constructed, the first resulting from the alignments of only ap2/erf domains of the  <dig> protein sequences in sesame; the second ml tree resulted from the alignments of  <dig> full length protein sequences including  <dig> ap2/erf in sesame and  <dig> protein sequences selected from each family of ap2/erf reported in the  <dig> relative species . in the first ml tree, all genes of ap <dig> family were clearly distinguished from those of the erf family. the ravs and soloists appeared to be more close to the ap <dig> family . the second ml tree was constructed to precisely dissect the functional groups within each subfamily according to arabidopsis ap2/erf genes which have been investigated extensively. the un-rooted tree divided the ap2/erf genes into  <dig> major groups . we found  <dig> groups  within dreb and erf subfamilies, respectively. in contrast to the dreb subfamily groups which clustered together, strangely, the erf subfamily genes formed two clades intervened by dreb: one gathered b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  and b <dig> and the other gathered b <dig> and b <dig>  the number of genes belonging to each group is reported in the table  <dig> and more in details in table  <dig> fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood tree of ap2/erf proteins in sesame, arabidopsis, utricularia gibba, grape, potato and tomato. bootstrap values ≥ 50 % are shown



in addition, we performed a genome-wide comparative analysis to identify the orthologous ap2/erf transcription factors between sesame, arabidopsis, grape and tomato . largest orthology of ap2/erf genes in sesame was found with tomato  followed by arabidopsis  and least with grape . the orthologous gene pairs and localization in each genome are presented in additional file  <dig>  all the four families were represented in the orthologous gene pairs and distributed throughout all the lgs except the lg <dig>  out of the  <dig> gene pairs between sesame and arabidopsis,  <dig> of arabidopsis ap2/erf genes retained one copy, three genes  retained two copies and only one gene  conserved a tripled copy in sesame genome. inversely, two genes in sesame  preserved two copies and  <dig> genes retained one copy in arabidopsis genome. in summary,  <dig> ap2/erf genes in sesame have  <dig> corresponding genes in arabidopsis genome. when compared with tomato, it was revealed that nine genes retained two copies while  <dig> genes retained one copy in the sesame genome. similar to arabidopsis, orthologous genes of grape also showed the retention of one, two and three copies patterns of genes in sesame genome. interestingly, four sesame genes  belonging to the ap <dig> family, found their orthologous counterpart in tomato, grape and arabidopsis at once. in overall, the results of the orthologs analysis and the phylogenetic relationships between sesame and its relatives were consistent with some orthologous genes found to be closely located in the tree.fig.  <dig> orthologous relationships of ap2/erf genes between a sesame and arabidopsis; b sesame and tomato; c sesame and grape genomes. green bars represent the chromosomes of each pair of species. “lg” represents the linkage groups of sesame genome and “chr” represents the chromosomes of the other species genomes



based on the accumulated evidences indicating that the ap2/erf proteins are involved in various abiotic stress responses and then could help in marker-aided breeding, we performed ssr search in all of ap2/erf genes in sesame. the analysis yielded  <dig> ssr markers distributed throughout the lgs. twelve genes yielded two ssrs and no ssr marker was found in  <dig> ap2/erf genes . surprisingly, only two ssr motif types were retrieved including trinucleotide motif  and hexanucleotide motif . these markers developed, would be useful in genotyping and mas for sesame improvement towards abiotic stresses.

gene structure and conservative motifs distribution analysis of ap2/erf genes
to gain insights into the structural diversity of the ap2/erf genes, we constructed a phylogenetic tree with the full length protein sequences of the four families and displayed the exon/intron organization in the coding sequences by comparing their orfs with their genomic sequences . sesame ap2/erf genes contained  <dig> to  <dig> exons with nearly 70 % of intronless genes. the schematic structures revealed that most of the erf genes have  <dig> exon except the genes ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig> and ap2si <dig> which have exactly two exons. the four rav genes also possess only one exon with similar lengths. unlike the erf genes, the coding sequences of the ap <dig> genes are disrupted by many introns with the number of exons ranging from three  to ten . one exceptional case is the gene ap2si <dig> which displayed only one exon. finally, the two “soloist” genes showed exactly six exons, distributed in similar regions of the genes. besides the consistency with the phylogenetic analysis, we found that the genes that clustered in the same group displayed similar exon–intron structures, differing only in intron and exon lengths. this can be observed in the first clade of erf which gathered  <dig> genes  displaying  <dig> exons. however, this is not the case for all close gene pairs. for instance, the gene ap2si <dig> with only one exon occurred in the same cluster with the genes ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig> and ap2si <dig> which displayed more than eight exons.fig.  <dig> gene structures of  <dig> ap2/erf proteins according to each family. exons and introns are represented by colored boxes and black lines, respectively



in addition, to investigate the motifs shared by related proteins in the different families, the meme motif search tool was employed and the motifs found were then subjected to smart annotation and confirmed in pfam database. in total,  <dig> conserved motifs were identified, lengths ranging from 11- <dig> amino acids . the motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> specifying the ap <dig> domain were identified in all the  <dig> ap2/erf proteins while the motif  <dig> related to b <dig> domain was found in the four rav genes . however, the remaining motifs were unidentified when searched by smart and pfam databases. we further analyzed the motifs other than the ap2/erf conserved domain existing in some erf/dreb functional groups based on the conserved motifs described by nakano et al.  <cit> . the results showed that although small amino-acids vary slightly, sesame erf/dreb groups are characterized by the same conserved motifs identified by nakano et al.  <cit>  in arabidopsis and rice . this indicated the good conservation of this gene family in plant species. the phylogenetic tree and the motifs dissection results were consistent because most of the closely related members in the phylogenetic tree had common motifs composition and organization .fig.  <dig> motifs identified by meme tools in sesame ap2/erf protein sequences according to each family. fifteen motifs were identified and indicated by different colors. motif location was showed



tissue-specific expression profiling of ap2/erf genes and drought stress responses of dreb subfamily genes
transcriptome data from three tissue samples namely root, leaf and stem were used for identifying genes differentially expressed in these tissues. heat maps were generated according to the different ap2/erf subfamilies based on the rpkm values for each gene in all tissue samples . apart from ap2si <dig> gene that was not expressed across the tissues, all ap2/erf genes displayed very diverse expression. in general, it is observed that gene expression patterns were almost conserved within subfamilies, although expression levels of specific members could be changed from tissue to tissue. the erf family exhibited the highest expression in all tissues. similarly, high expressions of two members  of the rav family were shown in all tissues while the two remaining members displayed a relatively low expression level. the ap <dig> family expression levels were lower than most of other ap2/erf genes. in general, majority of genes displayed a higher expression in the root compared to other tissues. furthermore,  <dig>  % of tfs  were expressed in all tissues suggesting a control of a broad set of genes at transcriptional level. the ap <dig> genes ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig> and ap2si <dig> exhibited stem-specific expression; the erf gene ap2si <dig> exhibited root-specific expression while no specific gene was expressed in leaf . the genes ap2si <dig> and ap2si <dig> ; ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig> and ap2si <dig>  were found to be constitutively expressed at a relatively high levels in all the three tissues.fig.  <dig> expression profile analysis of ap2/erf genes in sesame tissues according to each family. a erf. b ap <dig> family c rav and soloist families d venn diagram depicting the distribution of shared expressed ap2/erf genes among sesame tissues. transcriptome data were used to measure the expression level of ap2/erf genes in roots, stem tip and leaves. the color scale for expression values is shown



qrt-pcr was used to analyze the expression profiles of dreb genes under drought stress condition. as shown in fig.  <dig>  an overall differential expression patterns were observed among the genes. twenty-three dreb genes were up-regulated under drought stress including  <dig> genes with more than 2-fold rate increase of expression level , suggesting that these genes might play some important roles in the regulation of drought stress in sesame. more remarkably, the gene ap2si <dig> belonging to the dreb <dig> group, significantly exhibited the highest expression level with more than 16-fold rate increase. the genes ap2si <dig> , ap2si <dig> , ap2si <dig> , ap2si <dig> , ap2si <dig> , ap2si <dig> , ap2si <dig>  and ap2si <dig>  also displayed strong expression levels . in contrast, the 3-days of drought stress has decreased the transcript abundance of  <dig>  dreb genes. four genes namely ap2si <dig> , ap2si <dig> , ap2si <dig>  and ap2si <dig>  were the most repressed ones with more than 10-fold decrease of expression levels. in overall, dreb groups show acute responses to drought and might related to sesame drought tolerance knowing that the material used in the qrt-pcr is a strong drought tolerant accession.fig.  <dig> dreb genes induction rates in sesame roots during 3 days of drought stress in comparison to control condition. transcripts abundance was quantified through qrt-pcr and the experimental values were normalized using sesame actin <dig> as reference gene. the mean values issued from three independent biological replicates were analysed for significance using the statistical t-test . the histograms represent the relative expression values of induction rates . the green bars represent the most up-regulated genes, the pink bars represent the genes moderately up-regulated and the red bars represent the down-regulated genes. * means significant 2-fold rate increase in gene expression 



discussion
in this study,  <dig> ap2/erf family genes were identified in the sesame genome. compared to the five related species, sesame harbors the lowest number of ap2/erf genes. sesame was estimated to have diverged from the tomato-potato lineage approximately  <dig> mya  and from u. gibba approximately  <dig> mya  <cit> . moreover, genome analysis showed that both u. gibba and sesame had undergone recent duplication events . the relatively low number of ap2/erf genes found in sesame genome is surprising, knowing on one hand that, sesame is relatively tolerant to drought and many other abiotic stresses  <cit>  compared to the  <dig> related species and in the other hand, the role of ap2/erf genes in response to abiotic stresses in plants. this suggests the possibility of a gene loss event, which often follows wgd, during the evolutionary process of sesame. similar assumptions were posited in castor bean which also naturally displays a strong tolerance to diverse environmental stresses but contains small ap2/erf superfamily members  <cit> . we further compared the members of each subfamily between sesame and u. gibba and found that genes loss might occur mainly in erf and dreb subfamilies.

according to the classification of  <cit> , the ap <dig> family members should have had two ap2/erf domains. however, in this study, it was discordant that  <dig> genes namely ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig>  ap2si <dig> and ap2si <dig> with only one ap2/erf domain were classified in the same group as the “real” ap <dig> family members. recently, many authors reported similar results regarding the ap <dig> family members with only one ap2/erf domain  and was close to the well-studied gene dreb2a in arabidopsis involved in responses to water stress and heat stress  <cit> . hence, it is possible to hypothesize that these genes might be involved in similar activities. likewise, individual gene function could also be predicted based on the close relationships between sesame and arabidopsis through the homolog-based gene function prediction. for example, the gene ap2si <dig> belonging to the ap <dig> family might play similar role as its ortholog at4g <dig> from arabidopsis involved in the floral identity specification as well as development of the ovule and seed coat  <cit> .

gene expression patterns can also provide important clues for gene function prediction  <cit> . the tissue-specific expression profiling showed that most of the ap2/erf genes are expressed in all sesame tissues analyzed. however, a higher expression was detected in sesame root and similar results were reported in castor bean  <cit> , chinese cabbage  <cit>  and foxtail millet  <cit> . the erf, rav and soloist family members displayed higher expression in sesame tissues than ap <dig> family members indicating that these families might play a central role in tissues development and sesame plant growth  <cit> .

the variability in expression patterns of sesame dreb genes observed in this study indicated that they might be involved in different regulation pathways for drought stress response. moreover, we observed that the genes from the same group could be expressed differently in response to drought stress and, therefore, are thought to have different functions. expression analyses of dreb genes also showed unusual and plausible roles for some group members during drought stress. this is the case of the dreb <dig> group members which functions are scarcely reported in the literature  <cit> . out of the ten members of this group, seven were highly up-regulated, pinpointing their importance in drought stress response in sesame. in the same line, the dreb <dig> genes are mostly known as cold response genes  <cit> ; however, as reported by some authors  and confirmed in our study , these genes are highly involved in drought stress response pathways in sesame knowing that sesame is not cold areas crop but grown in arid and semi-arid areas. hence, these functional dreb groups might probably participate in the relative drought tolerance naturally exhibited by sesame. intriguingly, it is noteworthy that, the dreb <dig> genes which are well described in many crops as actively involved in drought response pathways  <cit>  do not seem to be highly expressed in our study. this uncommon feature may indicate that this group’s members might be involved principally in the regulation of other stress transduction pathways in sesame. knowing sesame as a survivor crop mainly grown in marginal areas with the occurrence of high temperatures and frequent drought, we may hypothesize from our results that, sesame has probably oriented and dedicated a large part of its dreb group’s members to regulate its main abiotic stresses especially drought. the strongly up-regulated gene identified in this study  is the ortholog of at1g <dig> in arabidopsis, described as responsive to the chitin treatment, a main elicitor of the plant defense response against pathogens  <cit> . this indicates possible new functions of this gene which plays essential role in abiotic stress tolerance in plant and may be an excellent candidate for the engineering of sesame breeding with improved drought stress tolerance.

CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted on the ap2/erf superfamily in sesame to date. therefore, this is the first comprehensive study on these tfs in sesame aiming to help elucidating the genetic basis for the stress adaptation of sesame especially for drought tolerance. one hundred and thirty two ap2/erf genes were identified in the sesame genome including all families previously reported in the ap2/erf superfamily. in addition, the expression patterns described together with the comparison of homologs from other species can provide a basis for identifying the roles of the different members of sesame ap2/erf genes. hence, further works should rely on these gene resources to characterize candidate genes to improve tolerance to major abiotic constraints of sesame production.
