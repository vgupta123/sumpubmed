BACKGROUND
environmental changes and extreme conditions, such as temperature variations, drought and salinity, adversely affect plant growth and cause major yield loss of agriculturally relevant crops worldwide. however, plants do not passively accept these abiotic stresses and, therefore, have developed sophisticated mechanisms for perception, transduction and adaptive responses to cope with the environmental stressors and to restore the cellular homeostasis under stress conditions  <cit> . in eukaryotic cells, the stress signaling systems allow intensive and integrate communications not only between the cell surface and the extracellular environment but also among intracellular organelles, which can accommodate adaptive responses. the understanding of the plant stress signaling systems along with the distinctions between detrimental effects and adaptive advantage is crucial for engineering superior crops.

the endoplasmic reticulum  is a key signaling organelle involved in the activation of cellular stress responses in eukaryotic cells. one such well-characterized signaling event is the unfolded protein response , which is activated to cope with the disruption of er homeostasis that results in the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of the organelle  <cit> . in mammalian cells, upr is transduced as a tripartite module through the er membrane receptors  protein kinase-like er kinase ,  inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase and endonuclease 1α  and  activating transcription factor  <dig>   <cit> . upon disruption of er homeostasis, plant cells activate upr through ire <dig> homologs  and membrane–tethered bzip transcription factors , which are functionally related to the mammalian atf <dig>  <cit> . the mrna of a third class of er membrane-associated upr transducer, bzip <dig>  serves as a substrate for the endonuclease activity of ire1a/ire1b  <cit> . ire1a/b activation by er stress mediates an unconventional splicing of the unspliced bzip <dig> mrna  to generate an alternatively spliced transcript , which lacks the transmembrane-encoded sequences and hence is translated into a soluble protein to activate upr inducible promoters in the nucleus. er stress also triggers the release of bzip17/bzip <dig> from the er membrane  <cit> . upon stress, bzip <dig> and bzip <dig> move from the er membrane to the golgi where they are proteolytically cleaved by sp <dig> and sp <dig> allowing the bzip domain to be translocated to the nucleus . recently, a plasma membrane-associated member of the plant-specific nac domain-containing tf family, atnac <dig>  has also been described as a relevant player in regulating upr downstream gene expression  <cit> . therefore, in plants, the upr operates via ire1a/ire1b-bzip <dig>  sp1/sp2-bzip17/bzip <dig> and atnac <dig> modules to coordinately up-regulate er-resident molecular chaperones and activate the er-associated degradation protein system . however, if er stress is sustained and upr fails to restore er homeostasis, a cell death signal is activated. persistent er stress has been shown to trigger both er–stress specific and shared pcd  signaling pathways elicited by other death stimuli .

a plant-specific er stress-induced cell death response is mediated by the er membrane-tethered nac <dig> transcription factor  <cit> . in response to er stress, nac <dig> is relocated to the nucleus to control the expression of downstream genes involved in pcd, such as nac <dig>  metacaspase  <dig>  and bcl- <dig> associated athanogene . in addition to the nac089-mediated cell death response, the arabidopsis g protein β-subunit <dig>  was firstly reported as a positive regulator of er stress-induced cell death  <cit> , but contrasting results were later reported by chen and brandizzi  <cit> . more recently, agb <dig> was shown to function as a cell death positive regulator as mutations in agb <dig> suppressed the cell death response in bir1- <dig> and in transgenic plants overexpressing suppressor of bir <dig>   <cit> .

a distinct plant-specific, er stress-shared cell death response is the er and osmotic stress-integrated signaling, which converges on developmental cell death domain -containing n-rich proteins  to transduce a cell death signal with hallmarks of pcd  <cit> . the expression of dcd/nrp is controlled by the er and osmotic stress-induced transcription factor  gmerd <dig>  which specifically binds to the dcd/nrp promoters to activate the transcription of these genes  <cit> . induction of dcd/nrp activates a signaling cascade that culminates with the induction of plant-specific tfs gmnac <dig> and gmnac <dig>  <cit> , which form heterodimers to fully transactivate the vacuolar processing enzyme  promoter  <cit> . vpe exhibits caspase-1-like activity and induces plant-specific pcd, mediated by collapse of the vacuole  <cit> . therefore, dcd/nrp, gmnac <dig>  gmnac <dig> and vpe are involved in a plant-specific regulatory cascade that integrates osmotic stress–and er stress–induced pcd. because dcd/nrp was the first component to be discovered, this stress–induced transduction pathway is often referred to as the nrp–mediated cell death signaling  <cit> .

as a branch of the er stress response that connects with other environmentally induced responses, the nrp–mediated cell death signaling pathway may allow for the versatile adaptation of cells to different stresses  <cit> . accordingly, we have previously showed that this pathway is activated by drought and the modulation of this signaling event by the constitutive expression of the er–resident molecular chaperone binding protein  promotes a better adaptation of transgenic lines to drought  <cit> . bip overexpression also increased tolerance of soybean transgenic seedlings to tunicamycin, an inducer of er stress, and to peg, which induces osmotic stress  <cit> . in soybean, bip attenuates the propagation of the stress–induced cell death signal by modulating the expression and activity of the components of the cell death pathway gmnrp–a, gmnrp–b, gmnac <dig> and vpe  <cit> .

in spite of the relevance of the dcd/nrp–mediated signaling as a versatile adaptive response to multiple stresses, mechanistic knowledge of the pathway is lacking and the extent to which this pathway may operate in the plant kingdom has not been investigated. here, we showed first that the dcd/nrp–mediated cell death components are represented in both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous genome and, like in soybean, they function to propagate a cell death signal in response to er and osmotic stress in arabidopsis. using reverse genetic, the characterized elements were sequentially ordered in the signaling pathway. furthermore, we showed that arabidopsis bip attenuates the dcd/nrp–mediated cell death signaling and thereby confers tolerance to drought in arabidopsis, suggesting that conserved regulatory mechanisms are responsible for the bip–mediated increases in water stress tolerance in plants.

RESULTS
the components of the dcd/nrp–mediated cell death signaling are widely distributed in the plant kingdom
the previously characterized soybean genes of the nrp–mediated cell death signaling were used as prototypes for the identification of homologs in the genomes of arabidopsis thaliana, carica papaya, citrus sinensis, cucumis sativis, glycine max, manihot esculenta, phaseolus vulgaris, solanum lycopersicum, solanum tuberosum, triticum aestivum, oryza sativa and zea mays. for each signaling module component, we selected the five most related components of each plant species to construct phylogenetic trees using bayesian inference.

a striking feature of the soybean genome is the retention of extended blocks of duplicated genes  <cit> . the six soybean gmnrp paralogs  were clustered in pairs, consistent with duplication events. gmnrp–a and gmnrp–b were more closely related to each other as they clustered together  and differed largely from the gmnrp–c sequences . both gmnrp–a and gmnrp–b are involved in the nrp–mediated cell death signaling and they displayed representative homologs in all plant species  <cit>  . among the arabidopsis nrp homologs, atnrp– <dig>  and atnrp- <dig>  displayed the highest sequence similarity to gmnrps; atnrp <dig>  clustered with gmnrp-a and gmnrp-b, whereas atnrp <dig>  was close related to gmnrp-c from soybean. the arabidopsis atnrp <dig> has been described previously  <cit> . like atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig> contains n-rich and dcd domains and belongs to the group i of dcd domain–containing proteins  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of gmnrp–like genes. the amino acid sequences of nrp-like proteins were recovered from tair  and phytozome v <dig>  databases and aligned using muscle. phylogenetic trees were constructed using bayesian inference performed with mrbayes v <dig> . <dig> with mixed amino acid substitution model . the analyses were carried out running  <dig> . <dig> generations and excluding the first  <dig> . <dig> generations as burn–in. gmnrps from soybean is depicted in blue and from arabidopsis in red. background colors demark clusters and sub–clusters formed by nrp homologs. the three–letter abbreviation in parenthesis preceding the nomenclature of the nrp homologs denotes the plant species, such as ath: arabidopsis thaliana, cpa: carica papaya, csi: citrus sinensis, csa: cucumis sativis, gma: glycine max, mes: manihot esculenta, pvu: phaseolus vulgaris, sly: solanum lycopersicum, stu: solanum tuberosum, tae: triticum aestivum, osa: oryza sativa and zma: zea mays




although dcd/nrp–a and dcd/nrp–b have redundant and relevant functions in cell death signaling, it remains to be determined whether gmnrp–c also functions in the transduction pathway. the other three selected arabidopsis nrp–like sequences formed two separate groups , which may not represent nrp orthologs of soybean gmnrp–a and gmnrp–b due to the low similarity of sequence among them. in both gmnrp–a/gmnrp–b–based cluster  and gmnrp–c cluster , the nrp homologs formed sub–clades of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous genes. the conservation of sequences of these nrp–like genes in other plant species is strongly suggestive of their functional importance and identities.

the execution of the cell death program has been proposed to occur through nrp–mediated induction of the gmnac81–gmnac30–vpe module  <cit> . consistent with a duplication event, gmnac <dig> is clustered in pair with the paralog gmnac <dig> ; whereas gmnac <dig> is represented by a small family in the soybean genome   <cit> . gmnac <dig> and gmnac <dig> form a unique clade  that encompasses at least one possible ortholog from each plant species, including monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous representatives and a single–copy gene from arabidopsis . the gmnac30–based clade  contains the five members of the soybean gmnac <dig> family  and four homologs from arabidopsis, in addition to representatives of all plant species. the other selected sequences that cluster separately from the gmnac <dig> and gmnac <dig> clades were not considered putative orthologs due to the low sequence identity and lack of functional characterization.

the vpe family has five representatives in the soybean genome  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis revealed that four soybean vpe paralogs , and two arabidopsis paralogs, alphavpe and gammavpe, formed a unique clade  that was separated from the fifth soybean vpe, glyma01g <dig>  which clustered with monocotyledonous homologs . in addition to high similarity of sequence, the arabidopsis alphavpe and gammavpe display similar expression pattern and the encoded proteins exhibit caspase 1–like activity  <cit> . the four most closely related soybean vpes display similar expression profiles during development and in response to stress and one of them, glyma.14g <dig>  has been shown to be induced by gmnac <dig> and gmnac <dig>  <cit> . the expression profiles and functions of more distantly related vpes have not been examined. the high conservation of the components of the er stress nrp–mediated cell death signaling among soybean and other dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plant species suggests that this cell death signaling may be a general er stress response in plants rather a specific transduction pathway in soybean.

we next examined whether the structural homology of the pathway components would reflect functional conservation of the cell death response in plants. the molecular tools for the characterization of this pathway in other plant species are still limited. in contrast, in the arabidopsis model system, reverse genetic studies are possible to assign function and hierarchical order to components of signal transduction pathways. therefore, we examined whether the stress–induced dcd/nrp–mediated signaling would function in arabidopsis, integrating multiple stress signals into a cell death response, as described in soybean.

functional conservation of the stress–induced dcd/nrp–mediated cell death response in arabidopsis
soybean nrps and gmnac <dig> are induced by the osmotic stress inducer peg, and the inducer of er stress, tunicamycin  <cit> . among a series of other stress inducers, the gene atnrp <dig> has also been shown to be induced by osmotic stress  <cit>  and in response to the er stress inducer tunicamycin  <cit> . as putative components of the stress–induced dcd/nrp–mediated signaling that integrates a cell death signal in response to er stress and osmotic stress, we examined whether atnrp <dig> and anac <dig> would respond to these stresses. fifteen days–old arabidopsis seedlings  were treated with peg  and tunicamycin  during 24 h and the gene expression was analyzed by qrt–pcr. the effectiveness of the stress treatments was monitored by analyzing the expression of the osmotic–stress marker rab <dig> gene and the er stress marker calnexin  gene . under these conditions, atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig> and anac <dig> were induced by osmotic stress  and er stress , although with differences in their induction kinetics. atnrp <dig> displayed higher level of induction at 12 h after peg treatment and at 6 h after tunicamycin treatment. atnrp <dig> was also induced by both treatments, although to a lower extent as compared to the expression of atnrp <dig> and exhibited a late kinetic of induction in response to peg. anac <dig> was induced with different kinetic from atnrps, reaching maximum induction at 24 h after peg and tunicamycin treatment. we also monitored the tunicamycin and peg induction of an arabidopsis vpe ortholog , which has been shown to be the downstream component of the pathway that acts as the executioner of the cell death program   <cit> . like the other components of the pathway, gvpe was induced by osmotic stress  and er stress .fig.  <dig>

as putative components of the er stress–and osmotic stress–integrating signaling pathway, we examined whether transient expression of atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig>  anac <dig> and vpe would activate a cell death program in tobacco leaves. after 7 days of agroinfiltration, the leaf sectors expressing atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig>  anac <dig> and vpe displayed a chlorotic phenotype with necrotic lesions as a result of massive cell death, as opposing to the green phenotype of the right half of the leaves, which was infiltrated with agrobacterium alone . the transient expression of the transgenes  was monitored by immunoblotting total protein from agroinfiltrated sectors with anti–gfp serum  and by determining transcript accumulation via qrt–pcr . the expression of the positive control genes, gmnrp–a and gmnrp–b, also induced a chlorotic phenotype , contrasting with the remaining green phenotype displayed by the expression of a bip gene, used for cell death inhibition . these phenotypes correlated with the chlorophyll loss in the agroinfiltrated sectors  and the extent of lipid peroxidation  and suggest a role for atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig>  anac <dig> and vpe as effectors of a cell death response. this interpretation was further confirmed by applying the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dutp nick end labeling  assay for the in situ detection of dna fragmentation in the atnrp1–, atnrp2–and anac036–expressing leaf sectors . the extensive cleavage of nuclear dna is one feature of cell death. the nuclei of the leaf sectors that were transformed with the empty vector fluoresced intensely with dapi and exhibited only tunel–negative nuclei. in contrast, the atnrp1–, atnrp2–and anac036–expressing samples had tunel–positive nuclei that displayed the same degree of staining as the gmnrp–b–expressing leaf sectors . these results suggest that atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig> and anac <dig> promote cell death when they are transiently expressed in tobacco leaves, a functional role reminiscent of the soybean components of the osmotic stress–and er stress–induced cell death signaling pathway  <cit> . vpe has also been show to mediate pcd in plants  <cit> . vpe–dependent pcd pathway has been shown to operate in the immune response, in the responses to a variety of stress inducers, in leaf senescence and in the development of various tissues  <cit> .fig.  <dig> arabidopsis atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig>  ana <dig> and vpe cause cell death in planta. a phenotypes of agroinfiltrated leaves with the indicated genes. the left half of leaves from 3 weeks–old n. benthamiana were infiltrated with agrobacterium cells transformed with p35s: atnrp <dig>  p35s: atnrp <dig>  p35s: anac <dig> and p35s: vpe expression vectors. pictures were taken 6 days after infiltration. the lower panel shows the immunoblottings of the agroinfiltrated proteins probed with anti–gfp serum. b chlorophyll loss induced by atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig>  anac <dig> and vpe expression. total chlorophyll, chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b were determined from the leaf sectors agroinfiltrated with the described dna constructions. values are given as mean ± s.e. from three biological replicates. c lipid peroxidation induced by atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig>  anac <dig> and vpe expression. leaf lipid peroxidation was monitored by determining the level of thiobarbituric acid–reactive compounds and expressed as the malondialdehyde content. error bars indicate the 95 % confidence interval based on a t–test . d transient expression of dcd/nrp–mediated cell death signaling orthologs from arabidopsis induces dna fragmentation. tobacco protoplasts were electroporated with the constructions carrying atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig>  anac <dig>  nrp–b, under control of 35s promoter or the empty vector, as a negative control. after 36 h of agroinfiltration, protoplasts from leaf sectors were submitted to tunel labeling. the nuclei were stained with dapi



we next used reverse genetics to examine whether atnrp <dig> and atnrp <dig> were involved in an er stress–induced cell death program in arabidopsis. rt–pcr on rna from atnrp <dig> or atnrp <dig> leaves detected no accumulation of the atnrp1or atnrp <dig> transcripts in the homozygous t–dna insertion mutant, confirming it is atnrp <dig> or atnerp <dig> null alleles . the er stress inducer tunicamycin has been shown to promote cell death in soybean and arabdopsis leaves with hallmarks of senescence and pcd. seedlings of atnrp <dig> and atnrp <dig> knockout lines were treated with the er stress inducer tunicamycin and we monitored leaf yellowing and chlorophyll loss . after four days of treatment, the leaves of col– <dig> were completely pale, whereas the leaves of atnrp <dig> and atnrp <dig> displayed green sectors, characteristic of chlorophyll integrity. this phenotype was associated with higher chlorophyll content in atnrp <dig> and atnrp <dig> stressed seedlings as compared with wild type stressed seedlings . expression of atnrp <dig> in the atnrp <dig> mutant restored the wild type content of chlorophyll  and overexpression of atnrp <dig> increased er stress–induced chlorophyll loss, a phenotype consistent with enhanced cell death in overexpressing lines. although we could select for atnrp1–complementing lines in the atnrp <dig> background, we did not obtain atnrp1–overexpressing lines; thereby, the overexpression studies were restricted to atnrp <dig>  these results were complemented with evans blue staining of arabidopsis seedlings under er stress conditions, as a measurement of cell death . loss of atnrp <dig> or atnrp <dig> function in atnrp <dig> and atnrp <dig> lines attenuated er stress–induced cell death as compared to col– <dig>  which was in marked contrast with the enhanced cell death phenotype displayed by er–stressed atnrp2–overexpressing lines. collectively, these results indicated that, similarly to the orthologs gmnrp–a and gmnrp–b from soybean, atnrp <dig> and atnrp <dig> are involved in er stress–induced cell death in arabidopsis.fig.  <dig> atnrp <dig> and atnrp <dig> are involved in er stress–induced cell death in arabidopsis. a loss of atnrp <dig> and atnrp <dig> function attenuated er–stress induced chlorophyll loss in arabidopsis. er stress was induced by transferring atnrp <dig> and atnrp <dig> seedlings to ms medium containing 5 μg/μltunicamycin. photography was taken 2 days after er stress induction. b chlorophyll content of knockouts, atnrp1–complementing and atnrp2–overexpressing lines under er stress. the chlorophyll content of seedlings from the genotypes, as indicated in the figure, was determined 24–h after tunicamycin treatment. c expression levels of atnrp <dig> in complementing lines and atnrp <dig> in overexpressing lines. total rna was isolated from 7 days-old arabidopsis seedlings, genotypes atnrp <dig> transformed with 35s: atnrp <dig> and col– <dig> transformed with 35s: atnrp <dig>  the transcript levels of atnrp <dig> or atnrp <dig>  as indicated, were quantified by qrt–pcr. gene expression was calculated using the 2-Δct method and actin as endogenous control. values are mean ± s.d. from three replicates. d evans blue staining of arabidopsis seedlings treated with 5 μg/ml tunicamycin or dmso. col– <dig>  atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig>  atnrp1–complementing line and atnrp2–overexpressing lines were treated with tunicamycin for 24 h and stained with evans blue



to examine further the functional relatedness between soybean and arabidopsis nrps, we took advantage of the stress hypersensitive phenotype of atnrp <dig> null alleles  for complementation assays. inactivation of atnrp <dig> gene has been shown to cause a higher inhibition of seedling root growth under osmotic stress as compared to wild type seedlings  <cit> . likewise, we found that peg inhibited root growth to a higher extent in atnrp <dig> knockout seedlings than in wild–type seedlings . this phenotype was linked to the inactivation of the atnrp <dig> gene because expression of atnrp <dig> in the atnrp <dig> restored the wild type phenotype . in order to determine whether gmnrps would replace the atnrp <dig> function, we transformed the knockout line with gmnrp–a, gmnrp–b and the arabidopsis homolog atnrp <dig>  under the control of 35s promoter. ectopic expression of atnrp <dig>  gmnrp–a and gmnrp–b reversed the atnrp <dig> phenotype upon osmotic stress as the complemented transgenic lines displayed wilt type root growth under peg . collectively, these results further indicated that arabidopsis and soybean nrps are functionally related.fig.  <dig> atnrp <dig>  nrp–a and nrp–b complement the enhanced sensitivity phenotype of root growth to osmotic stress displayed by the atnrp <dig> knockout line. a complementation assays of the atnrp <dig> function. the knockout line atnrp <dig> was transformed with p35s: atnrp <dig>  p35s: atnrp <dig>  p35s: nrp–a and p35s: nrp–b and germinated in ls–agar plates with and without peg  during 6 days. seeds of col– <dig> and atnrp <dig> lines were also germinated in ls–agar plates with and without peg  and root length was measured at 6 days post–germination photography was taken 6 days after germination under osmotic stress. b measurement of root length from col– <dig>  atnrp <dig> null alleles and atnrp1–complementing lines. error bars indicate the 95 % confidence interval based on a t–test 



the downstream components atnac <dig> and vpe require the atnrp <dig> function for tunicamycin and peg induction
gmnac <dig> has been placed downstream of nrps in the stress–induced nrp–mediated cell death signaling based on expression analysis and kinetics of the cell death activities of the pathway components  <cit> . ectopic expression of gmnrp–a or gmnrp–b has been shown to activate the gmnac <dig> promoter and to induce gmnac <dig> expression. furthermore, stress induction of gmnrp–b and gmnrp–a genes precedes the induction of gmnac <dig> and gmnac81–mediated cell death in tobacco leaves occurs with early kinetics, as expected from a downstream effector of the pathway. this sequential order of the components in the transduction signal pathway was confirmed in the arabidopsis system by a reverse genetic approach and promoter transactivation assay . both atnrp <dig> and col– <dig> lines were treated with peg and tunicamycin for 12 h and the extent of atnrp <dig> and anac <dig> induction was determined by qrt–pcr . the expression levels of atnrp <dig> and anac <dig> induced by tunicamycin or peg were remarkably lower in atnrp <dig> line compared to col– <dig>  furthermore, in the atnrp <dig> line, the stress induction of anac <dig> gene was delayed. these results indicate that the full induction of atnrp <dig> and anac <dig> by osmotic or er stress requires the atnrp <dig> function. to confirm that atnrp <dig> acts downstream of atnrp <dig>  we performed a gus transactivation assay in tobacco leaves using the 2–kb 5′ flanking sequences of atnrp <dig> and atnrp <dig> genes fused to the gus reporter. transient expression of atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig> or anac <dig> did not activate the atnrp <dig> promoter , whereas expression of atnrp <dig> and atnrp <dig>  but not anac <dig>  activated the atnrp <dig> promoter . collectively, these results placed atnrp <dig> upstream of atnrp <dig> and confirmed that anac <dig> is downstream of atnrps in the pathway. gvpe was also genetically linked to the stress–induced nrp–mediated cell death signaling because induction of gvpe by er stress and osmotic stress required the atnrp <dig> function . this result confirmed the biochemical data that identified vpe as a downstream component in the nrp–mediated cell death response in soybean  <cit> .fig.  <dig> atnrp <dig> is upstream of atnrp <dig> and ana <dig> in the stress–induced cell death response. a and b

bip overexpression attenuates the expression of dcd/nrp–mediated cell death genes and promotes water stress tolerance in arabidopsis
the stress–induced nrp–mediated cell death response has been shown to be modulated by bip  <cit> . overexpression of soybipd  in soybean attenuates and delays the cell death response induced by osmotic stress, er stress and drought, a phenotype that has been linked to the bip–mediated increases in the water stress tolerance  <cit> . among the arabidopsis bip paralogs, atbip <dig> is most related to atbip <dig>  and they share the highest sequence conservation with soybipd , whereas atbip <dig> is 77 % identical to soybipd. thereby, atbip <dig> and atbip <dig> genes were selected to examine whether the nrp–mediated cell death response in arabidopsis would share similar regulatory mechanisms as in soybean. then, we transformed arabidopsis col– <dig> with soybipd and also with the arabidopsis bip genes, atbip <dig> and atbip <dig>  and monitored the bip attenuation of the stress–induced expression of pathway components. the ectopically expressed soybean bipd protein accumulated to high levels in the independently transformed arabidopsis t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> lines and was correctly localized in microsomal fraction . ugpase was used as a cytosolic fraction–associated marker to demonstrate that soybipd was confined to the microsomal fraction . likewise, arabidopsis transformed with atbip1–gfp–hdel and atbip2–gfp–hdel fusions accumulated higher levels of bip mrna  and protein  than col– <dig>  accumulation of bip–gfp–hdel was detected by immunoblotting total protein with anti–gfp serum  and the endogenous bip levels + fusion proteins were monitored with an anti–soybipd serum . like the endogenous bips , bip–gfp–hdel was correctly localized in the microsomal fraction .

the induction of atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig> and anac <dig> by tunicamycin was lower in all bip–overexpressing lines than in col– <dig> . likewise, peg treatment induced the expression of atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig> and anac <dig> to a lower extent in bipdox t <dig>  bipdox t <dig> lines and bip1–overexpressing line than in col– <dig> . these results confirmed that bip also modulates the nrp–mediated cell death response in arabidopsis.fig.  <dig> overexpression of soybipd in arabidopsis attenuates the peg and tuncamycin–mediated induction of dcd/nrp–mediated cell death signaling genes. a and b

discussion
the components of the dcd/nrp–mediated cell death signaling is structurally conserved in the plant kingdom
dcd/nrp–mediated cell death pathway connects osmotic and er stress on nrp genes to activate a cell death program. this pathway was originally identified in soybean  <cit> , and circumstantial evidence indicates that it also operates in tobacco  <cit> . in this investigation, we extended the characterization of the cell death pathway by demonstrating that it is also conserved in other plant species. blast searches of the soybean nrps, gmnac <dig>  gmnac <dig> and vpe sequences against  <dig> plant genomes, including  <dig> dicotyledonous species and  <dig> monocotyledonous species revealed that the components of the nrp–mediated cell death signaling are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. plylogenetic analysis identified homologs in all plant species, based on the criteria of sequence similarity and clustering in the same soybean genes–derived clades. remarkably, all analyzed plant genomes harbor homologs of all components of the nrps/gmnac81/gmnac30/vpe signaling module, which share significant structural and sequence similarities with their soybean counterparts.

all homolgs were further examined for conservation in structural configuration . the homologs of dcd/nrps from the other plant species share high sequence conservation with gmnrp–a–and gmnrp–b–deduced protein sequences and they cluster together as subgroup i of the dcd domain–containing protein family  <cit> . members of this subgroup contain a highly conserved dcd domain at c–terminus and a more divergent n–rich domain at the n–terminus and they are plant–specific proteins. the downstream components of the dcd/nrp–mediated cell death signaling, gmnac <dig> and gmnac <dig>  belong to a plant–specific family of transcriptional factors, the nac  domain–containing superfamily of transcription factors. while gmnac <dig> is a member of the subgroup tern , which is induced by elicitors of the pathogen response  <cit> , gmnac <dig> is placed within the anac002/ataf <dig>  sub–family, which is induced by abiotic stress conditions  <cit> . all gmnac <dig> and gmnac <dig> homologs harbor a nac conserved domain at the n–terminus and a predicted nuclear localization signal. the high conservation of the components of the er stress nrp–mediated cell death response in the plant kingdom suggests that this cell death signaling response may be a general er stress response in plants rather a specific transduction pathway in soybean.

dcd/nrp–mediated cell death response is functionally conserved in arabidopsis
we provided several lines of evidence revealing that the nrp–mediated cell death pathway also propagates a stress–induced cell death signal in arabidopsis with features of a pcd response. first, orthologs of all pathway components are present in the arabidopsis genome. among the dcd domain–containing n–rich proteins from arabidopsis, atnrp <dig> and atnrp <dig>  as designated in this investigation, share high conservation of sequence with gmnrp–a and gmnrp–b from soybean and belong to the same clade in phylogenetic analysis. likewise, another component of the dcd/nrp–mediated cell death signaling, gmnac <dig>  shares 62 % of identity with the arabidopsis protein anac <dig>  we also found two orthologs of the plant–specific vpe encoded by the genome of arabidopsis. second, similarly to the soybean orthologs, atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig>  anac <dig> and gvpe are induced by osmotic and er stress. we did not observe, however, a synergistic induction of the arabidopsis othologs by a combined treatment of both stresses, as already reported for the soybean cell death pathway components  <cit> . these differences in the expression profile may be explained by differences in the experimental conditions of the assays. the optimal conditions for arabidopsis exposition to the combined treatment, which would prevent the osmotic stress inducer peg to interfere with tunicamycin uptake, have not been established. in soybean, the plants are pre–treated with tunicamycin for six hours, and then peg is added for an additional ten hours  <cit> . third, as expected for components of a cell death signaling, the arabidopsis dcd/nrp–mediated cell death genes can promote pcd in planta. transient expression of atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig> and anac <dig> in tobacco leaves causes leaf yellowing, which was associated with chlorophyll loss in agroinfiltrated leaf sectors that evolved to necrotic lesions and enhanced lipid peroxidation , a phenotype similar to that developed by gmnrp–a, gmnrp–b and gmnac <dig> expression. this process of accelerated leaf yellowing induced by expression of dcd/nrp cell death pathway components has been shown to be associated with programmed cell death in soybean  <cit> . furthermore, expression of atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig> and anac <dig> in tobacco protoplasts promoted extensive dna fragmentation to similar extent as in the gmnrp–b–expressing control samples. the extensive cleavage of nuclear dna is one feature of cell death. finally, loss of atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig> function attenuated er stress–induced cell death, whereas overexpression of atnrp <dig> enhances cell death , confirming that these genes transduce a cell death signal in arabidopsis.

a functional conservation between atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig>  gmnrp–a and gmnrp–b orthologs was further demonstrated in complementation assays of the hypersensitive phenotype to osmotic stress displayed by the atnrp <dig> null mutants. under osmotic conditions, a further enhancement of root growth inhibition is clearly observed in the atnrp <dig> line . stable expression of atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig>  gmnrp–a or gmnrp–b in the atnrp <dig> null mutant rescued the wild–type phenotype and the root growth of transgenic lines under peg treatment was compared to the untransformed wild–type line. these results indicated that nrps may be involved in root growth under osmotic stress. consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of bip, a negative regulator of atnrp <dig> expression, recapitulates the enhanced phenotype of peg–mediated root growth inhibition of atnrp <dig> null alleles . likewise, bip overexpression in soybean also promotes root inhibition under osmotic stress and drought and represses gmnrp–a and gmnrp–b expression  <cit> . the nrp involvement in root growth is not likely associated with a cell death function but rather it may be linked to the pro–survival activity of upr. two lines of evidence argue favorably for this hypothesis. first, both gmnarp–a and gmnrp–b promoters harbor putative unfolded protein response elements , and the atnrp <dig> promoter contains two putative upres , which have the potential to be activated by upr branches under er stress   <cit> . second, loss of ire1a and ire1b function causes root inhibition indicating the relevance of an activated upr in root development  <cit> . under stress conditions, root growth requires a functional bzip <dig> in addition of ire1a/ire1b, implicating the ire1a/ire1b–bzip <dig> module of upr as a critical player not only in stress tolerance but also in root growth. however, it remains to be determined whether induction and function of nrps under osmotic stress are linked to the ire1a/ire1b–bzip <dig> arm of the upr.

the components of the dcd/nrp cell death signaling pathway have been identified in soybean mostly as a result of biochemical and forward genetic approaches and their hierarchical order in the pathway has been assigned based on expression and kinetic studies  <cit> . in the arabidopsis system, however, the characterization of the atnrp <dig> null alleles confirmed that atnrp <dig> is upstream of gmnac <dig> and atnrp <dig> expression depends on atnrp <dig> function. in fact, loss of atnrp <dig> function prevents osmotic and er stress–mediated induction of atnrp <dig> and the other downstream components of the pathway, anac <dig> and vpe. consistent with this interpretation, atnrp <dig> and atnrp <dig> transactivate the atnrp <dig> promoter, but not the atnrp <dig> promoter. as a downstream component, the transcriptional factor anac <dig> does not feedback regulate the atnrp <dig> and atnrp <dig> upstream components. recently, we demonstrated that the anac <dig> soybean homolog, gmnac <dig>  interacts with another member of the nac family, gmnac <dig>  to activate fully the expression of the downstream component vpe. it would be very interesting to investigate whether anac <dig> would require another member of the nac family for full transactivation of the vpe promoter, as for gmnac <dig>  <cit> .

bip overexpression promotes water stress tolerance and modulates dcd/nrp–mediated cell death response in arabidopsis
bip has been demonstrated to protect plants against abiotic and biotic stress conditions through gene expression modulation and posttranslational regulation of secretory proteins . as a molecular chaperone, bip attenuates the er stress response  <cit>  by regulating the activity of the upr transducer bzip <dig>  <cit> . in the absence of stress, plant bip is bound to arabidopsis atf6-like bzip <dig>  which remains in the er membrane  <cit> . upon er stress, bip dissociates from bzip <dig>  allowing it to be translocated to the golgi, where it is proteolytically cleaved by s1p/s2p and released from the membrane to be redirected to the nucleus  <cit> . in addition to controlling upr, plant bip displays protective functions under distinct stress conditions, including  the attenuation of er stress  <cit> ,  the promotion of drought tolerance in transgenic soybean  and tobacco  plants  <cit> ,  the activation of plant innate immunity  <cit>  and  the attenuation of er stress–and osmotic stress–induced cell death in soybean  <cit> . the bip protective properties under a water deficit regime are linked to its capacity to control the activity and expression of the cell death nrp/gmnac81/gmnac31/vpe signaling module  <cit> . here, we demonstrated that the nrp–mediated cell death signaling is also controlled negatively by bip in arabidopsis thaliana. overexpression of the soybipd and aradidopsis bip1/bip <dig> genes attenuated the osmotic and er stress induction of the cell death signaling genes atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig>  anac <dig> and vpe. the bip attenuation of cell death responses has been associated with bip–mediated increases in water stress tolerance in soybean and tobacco  <cit> . accordingly, in arabidopsis, bip–overexpressing lines were more tolerant to drought. the bip–overexpressing lines maintained leaf turgidity under dehydration conditions caused by drought stress, a typical phenotype mediated by bip overexpression in soybean and tobacco  <cit> . our current results revealed the conservation for a bip negative regulation of nrp–mediated cell death response in the plant kingdom and implicated bip as potential target for engineering water stress tolerance in other crops.

CONCLUSIONS
as plants are exposed to environmental changes and extreme conditions, they have developed coordinated and integrated mechanisms, which respond to these injuries and are immediately activated upon stresses. one such important mechanism is the dcd/nrp–mediated cell death response, which was first identified in soybean and is induced by multiple stresses. our results have demonstrated that this cell death signaling response may be a general stress response in plants rather a specific transduction pathway in soybean. this interpretation was based on in silico analysis of pathway homologs in the plant kingdom, which was complemented with functional studies of the cell death–signaling module in arabidopsis. in addition to being induced by er and osmotic stress, the arabidopsis components of the signaling module promoted extensive dna fragmentation in tobacco protoplasts and induced leaf yellowing, chlorophyll loss and lipid peroxidation in planta, a reminiscent pcd phenotype induced by the soybean orthologs. furthermore, loss of atnrp <dig>  atnrp <dig> function attenuated er stress–induced cell death and overexpression of atnrp <dig> enhanced cell death , confirming that these genes transduce a cell death signal in arabidopsis. by using reverse genetics, the arabidopsis orthologs were genetically linked to the cell death response in sequential order, conclusively defining the plant–specific nrp/anac36/vpe signaling module. like in soybean, bip attenuated the propagation of the stress–induced cell death signal in arabidopsis by modulating the expression and activity of the signaling module and hence conferred tolerance to drought. collectively, our results indicated that the components of the cell death–signaling module are structurally conserved in the plant kingdom and function in arabidopsis with conserved regulatory mechanism. the demonstration of regulatory and functional conservation of the stress–induced nrp–mediated cell death signaling in plants revealed a broad–spectrum potential for targeting the bip–mediated increases in drought tolerance in different crops.
