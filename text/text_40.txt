BACKGROUND
micrornas  are regulatory small rnas that have important roles in regulating development and stress responses in plants  <cit> . they repress gene expression by targeting cognate messenger rnas  for cleavage or translational repression  <cit> . since the identification of the first rice mirnas, based on sequence conservation with arabidopsis  <cit> , many new rice mirnas have been identified using high-throughput small rna sequencing approaches; the majority of these newly identified mirnas are rice-specific  <cit> . mir <dig> is conserved in higher plants and has been shown to regulate expression of a sub-group of apetala <dig> -like transcription factors that contain two ap <dig> domains in arabidopsis  <cit> , tobacco  <cit>  and maize  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, mir <dig> serves as a negative regulator of ap <dig> to specify floral organ identity. over-expression of mir <dig> causes floral homeotic phenotypes similar to ap <dig> loss-of-function mutants  <cit> , such as conversion of sepals and petals into carpels, and reduction of stamen numbers  <cit> . expression of a mir172-resistant version of ap <dig> increases stamen number  <cit> . arabidopsis mir <dig> also acts as a repressor of the ap2-like genes, target of eat  <dig> , toe <dig> and toe <dig> to promote early flowering  <cit> . mir172-mediated cleavage of mrnas of these target genes has been detected  <cit> , but there is strong evidence to suggest that the primary mode of repression of these target genes by mir <dig> is translational inhibition  <cit> . in turn, the transcription of mir <dig> target genes is under direct or indirect feedback regulation by their protein products  <cit> .

in maize, expression of glossy <dig> , an ap2-like gene with an mrna targeted for cleavage by mir <dig>  is gradually down-regulated during the early stages of vegetative development due to a progressive increase of mir <dig> levels, promoting the juvenile-to-adult transition  <cit> . another two ap2-like paralogs, indeterminate spikelet <dig>  and sister of indeterminate spikelet <dig> , play multiple roles in inflorescence architecture in maize. loss-of-function mutants of ids <dig> lose spikelet determinacy and generate multiple florets  <cit> . no mutant phenotype has been observed in single sid <dig> mutants, but ids <dig> sid <dig> double mutants produce fewer tassel branches and generate multiple bracts in place of florets  <cit> . the ids <dig> sid <dig> double mutants rescue the phenotypic defects of tasselseed <dig> , a loss-of-function mutant of mir172e  <cit> , one of the five mir <dig> genes in maize. this result suggests that both ids <dig> and sid <dig> are targets of mir <dig>  it has been shown that ids <dig> and sid <dig> are regulated at the level of translation and transcript stability, respectively  <cit> , indicating that a single mirna can act in different ways on closely related mrnas. the maize flowering-time gene zmrap <dig>  is closely related to arabidopsis toe <dig>  over-expression of zmrap <dig>  results in delayed flowering, while knock-down of this gene leads to early flowering  <cit> . however, it is not known whether or not zmrap <dig>  is also regulated by mir <dig> as toe <dig> is in arabidopsis.

the rice mir <dig> family contains four members , which are predicted to target five ap2-like genes, os03g <dig>  os04g <dig>  os05g <dig>  os06g <dig> and os07g <dig> . os07g <dig>  has been shown to be required for the correct timing of the transition from spikelet to floral meristem and for determination of floral organ identity. the t-dna insertion mutant of snb generates additional bracts  before development of a floret and also shows defects in floral organ development  <cit> . snb, os03g <dig>  os05g <dig> and os06g <dig> are the putative rice orthologs of maize sid <dig>  ids <dig>  zmrap <dig>  and gl <dig>  respectively  <cit> .

we characterized the expression of mir <dig> and its putative ap2-like target genes in rice and did not find inversely correlated expression patterns although at least three of the ap2-like mrnas were found to be cleavage targets of mir <dig>  suggesting roles of mir <dig> via transcriptional and translation repression with the latter as a possible predominant mode of action of mir <dig> in rice. to investigate the functions of the ap2-like genes, we studied the effect of elevated expression of mir <dig> on rice development. over-expression of mir172b recapitulates the phenotypes of snb and also gives rise to additional developmental defects not seen in snb. these results suggest that snb and at least one of the other ap2-like target genes are down-regulated in plants over-expressing mir172b, indicating that other members of the ap2-like gene family also have roles in rice floret development.

RESULTS
expression profiles of mir <dig> and its target genes
to determine where mir <dig> and its target transcripts are expressed during rice development, we analyzed mir <dig> expression by rna gel blot and expression of the ap2-like target mrnas by qrt-pcr in various tissues. the mature mir172a-d sequences differ only in their 5' and 3' bases and therefore hybridization with a mir172a probe is likely to detect expression of all mature mir <dig> sequences. in wild-type plants, mir <dig> expression varied considerably between organs and developmental stages. mature mir <dig> accumulation increased significantly in leaves but not in roots as plants grew, reaching a maximum in the flag leaf . similar expression patterns of mir <dig> have also been observed in vegetative tissues of arabidopsis and maize  <cit> , suggesting that mir <dig> has a conserved role during vegetative development. in reproductive tissues, mir <dig> was consistently expressed although its abundance reduced gradually during panicle development . expression of mir <dig> was below the detection limit in  <dig> daf  grains . higher expression of mir <dig> in later stage vegetative tissues and developing young panicles is consistent with a role in regulating the timing of floret initiation and development in rice.

the abundance of intact transcripts of mir <dig> target genes was analyzed by qrt-pcr using primer pairs spanning the mir <dig> cleavage sites. expression of snb  was highest in developing panicles , in which differentiation of the spikelet and floral organs is progressing; expression of snb was also high in roots from 10-leaf plants . os03g <dig> was highly expressed in developing panicles and also in young seedlings  . in contrast expression of os05g <dig> was highest in young seedlings and roots . all these three genes had a very low expression level in embryo, endosperm and pericarp of  <dig> daf grains . expression of snb and os03g <dig> showed an inverse correlation with the abundance of mir <dig> in two-leaf shoots, leaf four and leaf ten, but generally the expression of mir <dig> was not inversely correlated with the expression of its targets in the tissues analyzed . we were unable to specifically amplify os06g <dig> even though several primer combinations were tried; this could be a result of very low expression . we were unable to quantify os04g <dig> expression as the gene-specific product was always accompanied by a non-specific product. these expression profiles support previous results showing that snb has a role in controlling spikelet determinacy and floret development  <cit> , and also suggest that os03g <dig> could play a role in floret development.

mir172-mediated cleavage of target genes
mir <dig> has been shown to cleave ap <dig> and ap2-like target mrnas in arabidopsis  <cit>  and maize  <cit> , but is thought to act predominantly through translational repression  <cit> . to determine whether the five putative targets of mir <dig> in rice are cleaved by mir <dig>  5' rapid amplification of cdna ends  analysis was performed using rna isolated from two-leaf stage shoots, 1- <dig> daf grains and booting panicles . cleavage of os04g <dig> was detected in a mixed sample of shoot and grain as well as in booting panicles; cleavage of os06g <dig> was only detected in the mixed sample with a low frequency ; and cleavage of snb was only detected in booting panicles. no cleavage was detected for os03g <dig> or os05g <dig> in any of the samples analyzed . these results suggested tissue- or cell-type-specific expression of mir <dig> and/or its target genes.

over-expression of mir172b delays the transition from spikelet meristem to floral meristem
we generated transgenic plants expressing the stem-loop precursors of mir172a and mir172b, transcribed by the maize ubiquitin promoter. elevated levels of mir <dig> were detected in these mir <dig> over-expression plants, particularly in plants transformed with pre-mir172b . transgenic plants over-expressing mir172b showed normal vegetative growth and heading time, but the inflorescence  of the transformed plants was smaller, producing the half number of primary branches of the untransformed wild-type . a wild-type spikelet consists of a single floret and two subtending pairs of bract-like structures - a pair of rudimentary glumes and a pair of empty glumes . spikelets of plants over-expressing mir172b were generated from primary or secondary branches as in wild-type, but the majority of spikelets were abnormal and showed variable defects in floral organs. the common phenotypes of the mutated spikelets were that more than two, and in extreme cases as many as  <dig>  bract-like structures were generated before transition to floral development ; in some cases no obvious floral organs were produced . the majority of these spikelets lacked a pair of empty glumes . scanning electron microscopy  showed that the lower part of the rudimentary glumes in the wild-type plant had round projections and small trichomes . in the mir172b over-expression plants, similar round projections coated the surface of the bract-like structures though fewer trichomes were seen , suggesting that the additional bract-like structures in the mir172b over-expression lines have the same identity as rudimentary glumes. this result suggests that reproductive development of plants over-expressing mir172b was not affected until the formation of the spikelet meristem, but the transition from spikelet meristem to floral meristem was delayed, leading to the reiteration of bract-like structures.

over-expression of mir172b reduces fertility and seed weight
plants over-expressing mir172b showed significant floret defects and reduced fertility  compared to wild-type. based on the number of deformed spikelets and degree of fertility, plants over-expressing mir172b could be grouped into strong  and moderate  phenotypes. plants with <10% fertility and >10% severely degenerated spikelets were defined as having a strong phenotype, with the remainder classified as moderate phenotype plants. spikelets without obvious floral organs , or with several layers of small lemma- and palea-like structures but without distinguishable internal reproductive organs  were classed as severely degenerated spikelets. the percentage of severely degenerated spikelets was as high as 45% in some strong phenotype plants. in addition, the remaining spikelets of strong phenotype plants were also significantly deformed , with phenotypes including multiple layers of lemma and palea , twisted lemma and palea , degeneration of either lemma or palea , or leaf-like structures replacing lemma and palea . all of these deformed spikelets were sterile, and as a consequence, most strong phenotype plants were completely sterile. some strong phenotype plants set a small number of fertile spikelets but none of them had a wild-type appearance . on average, the moderate phenotype plants had ~6% severely degenerated spikelets and ~40% fertility , but less than 5% of the fertile spikelets were essentially normal, i.e. with a pair of empty glumes and normal lemma and palea. analysis of mir <dig> expression showed that plants with the strongest phenotypic aberrations had the highest expression levels of mir <dig> .

the common features of fertile but abnormal spikelets were that they had four or fewer lemma- and palea-like structures, and that part of or even the whole of the grain was naked due to failure of the lemma and palea to close after flowering  or because of degeneration of these structures . the weight of these seeds was reduced compared to wild-type seeds , with the most naked seeds showing the greatest reduction . this suggests that closing of lemma and palea may be important for optimal grain filling and maturation in rice.

over-expression of mir172b results in homeotic transformation and other changes of floral organs
the unit comprising lemma, palea and floral organs including two lodicules on the lemma side, six anthers and a carpel with two stigmas is called floret . wild-type lodicules have a wide base, a rough surface and a narrow apex . when flowering, the floret opens due to swelling of the lodicules, and closes after a few minutes  due to shrinking of the lodicules. in plants over-expressing mir172b, florets with five or more layers of lemma and palea could not open due to the tightly closed lemma and palea. florets that did not completely close up after flowering had altered numbers and/or morphology of lodicules. one  to as many as eight lodicules were observed . multiple lodicules were arranged in one  or two  whorls, with similar surface features to those of wild-type but swollen , or elongated significantly and converted into a structure similar to the palea marginal region . in the case of two whorls of lodicules, usually only the lodicule in the outer whorl was converted . in the converted lodicules, two edges of the base section retained their original identity , resulting in a mosaic floral organ. the most frequently observed mosaic floral organ was a lodicule base with an anther fused to the elongated lodicule apex . occasionally, a mosaic organ with a lodicule base and an anther top was observed at the innermost whorl of the floret, in which the mosaic organ replaced the carpel and the identities of two stigmas were also converted . in some florets, a stigma was partially converted into an anther . these results suggest that timing and/or positioning of the floral organ meristems are interrupted by over-expression of mir172b, indicating that a proper expression of mir <dig> target genes is important in specification of floral organ identities.

stamens were also frequently altered in plants over-expressing mir172b. all florets of the strong phenotype plants and approximately half the florets of the moderate phenotype plants had less than the six stamens found in wild-type . usually, anthers of plants over-expressing mir172b were slightly smaller than those of wild-type, although no other obvious defects were observed. the carpel was the most stable floral organ, with <5% of spikelets developing two carpels . in some spikelets both carpels were fertilized and developed into normal-looking grains . occasionally, three stigmas were observed instead of two . ectopic florets were found in ~10% of spikelets, a few of these developed incomplete internal floral organs , none were fertile.

plants transformed with pre-mir172a did not show any altered phenotypes , even though mir <dig> accumulated to a higher level than in wild-type plants .

snb mrna abundance is not reduced in mir172b over-expression plants
the phenotype observed in mir172b over-expression plants is consistent with reduced snb function during panicle development. as snb is cleaved by mir <dig> a reduced accumulation of snb mrna would be expected in mir172b over-expression plants. however, we observed more snb mrna accumulating in early stage panicles in these plants . a similar effect was observed for os05g <dig> mrna . reduced accumulation of the os03g <dig> mrna was observed in panicles between  <dig>  cm and  <dig> cm , suggesting that the over-expression of mir172b can lead to increased cleavage of this transcript.

discussion
in this study, we have shown that over-expression of mir172b in rice resulted in i) a smaller panicle due to reduction of primary branches, ii) spikelets with multiple bracts resembling rudimentary glumes, iii) florets with multiple layers of lemma- and palea-like structures but without empty glumes, iv) abortion of inner floral organs, especially in spikelets with more than  <dig> bracts or four layers of lemma- and palea-like structures, v) changes in numbers, size, appearance, and identities of floral organs, especially lodicules and stamens, vi) ectopic florets, and vii) sterility and reduced seed weight. these phenotypes not only recapitulated but enhanced the mutant phenotypes of snb, suggesting that snb and at least one of the other four targets of mir <dig> were repressed in plants over-expressing mir172b. we provide direct evidence for mir172-mediated cleavage for snb, os04g <dig> and os06g <dig>  however, expression of snb was not inversely correlated with expression of mir <dig> in wild-type, and over-expressing mir172b did not reduce the expression levels of snb in < <dig> cm long panicles where development of spikelets and florets is occurring, instead snb transcript abundance increased significantly. the unchanged or increased abundances of mir <dig> target mrnas in the mir172b over-expression plants is reminiscent of observations made in arabidopsis  <cit>  where there is evidence that mir <dig> acts to repress translation and for transcription of the ap2-like genes to be under negative feedback regulation via their protein products. our data cannot distinguish between these possibilities but do suggest a conservation of regulation of the ap2-like genes between arabidopsis and rice.

control of spikelet determinacy and floret development in rice
rice spikelets, initiated from primary or secondary branches of the inflorescence, have a determinate fate and consist of two rudimentary glumes and a single functional floret. previously, branched floretless <dig>  or frizzy panicle  and its maize ortholog branched silkless <dig>  have been shown to be regulators of spikelet determinacy in rice and maize, respectively  <cit> . knock-out mutants of bfl <dig> and bd <dig> fail to initiate floret meristems, and instead they continuously generate axillary branch meristems from the axils of rudimentary glumes to produce a highly branched inflorescence  <cit> , indicating that they specify meristem identity during the transition from spikelet meristem to floral meristem. recently, snb, a target of mir <dig>  has been shown to be another gene regulating this transition  <cit>  with snb mutants producing multiple bract-like structures that are equivalent to rudimentary glumes. our results show that snb is a target of mir <dig>  which adds another layer of complexity to the regulation of spikelet determinacy in rice. it has been proposed that snb acts downstream or independentlyof bfl <dig>  based on the phenotypes of the respective mutants and mrna expression patterns determined by in situ hybridization  <cit> . however, further experiments are required to confirm this relationship.

snb is required for the correct timing of the transition from spikelet meristem to floret meristem in rice as this transition is delayed in the snb mutants  <cit> . according to previous in situ results, snb is initially expressed in the branch meristem and spikelet meristem, and is then primarily restricted in the boundary region of the spikelet and glume primordia. once the spikelet meristem is converted into a floret meristem, a decreased expression of snb was observed  <cit> . our data showed that both mir <dig> and snb are highly expressed in < <dig> cm long panicles, so mir <dig> could be acting to restrict the expression domain of snb. however at present the precise expression domain of mir <dig> in the panicle is yet to be determined.

phylogenetic analysis has shown that snb and os03g <dig> are likely to be orthologous to maize sid <dig> and ids <dig>  respectively  <cit> . these genes together with the q gene of wheat  <cit>  appear to be grass specific and are involved in panicle and spikelet development. single mutants of sid <dig> do not show visible phenotypic changes, but null mutants of ids <dig> lose spikelet determinacy and produce extra lateral florets  <cit> . however, double mutants of ids <dig> and sid <dig> continuously initiate multiple bracts and do not make any florets  <cit> . thus, both ids <dig> and sid <dig> are necessary for initiation of floral meristems. both snb and the ids <dig> sid <dig> double mutants produce multiple bracts, but snb only occasionally produces bracts continuously  <cit> , whereas plants with strongly over-expressed mir172b have an average of 22% of spikelets without floral organs . we speculate that the additional floret defects observed in plants over-expressing mir172b are due to repression of os03g <dig> by over-expressed mir <dig> because both snb and os03g <dig> are relatively highly expressed in developing panicles , they have similar mrna expression patterns determined by in situ hybridization  <cit> , and os03g <dig> is down-regulated by elevated levels of mir <dig> in  <dig> - <dig> cm long panicles .

5' race results suggest that os04g <dig> is regulated by mir <dig> in both vegetative and reproductive tissues . among the five mir <dig> targets in rice, os04g <dig> is most similar to arabidopsis ap <dig> based on phylogenetic analysis, but its function has not been investigated in rice. in arabidopsis, both loss-of-function ap <dig> mutants and mir <dig> over-expression plants have carpels in place of perianth organs  due to the absence of ap <dig> and ectopic expression of agamous , a class c gene, in the outer two whorls of the flower primordium  <cit> . we occasionally observed florets with two carpels or a carpel with multiple stigmas. in most florets multiple lodicules with changed morphology were seen. lodicules are thought to be homologous to petals in eudicots. these phenotypic changes could be partly resulted from repression of snb because the snb mutant also showed changes in lodicules  <cit> . further investigation is required to determine whether these altered phenotypes are also related to changes in expression of os04g <dig> 

functional specificity of mir <dig> members
maize mir172e loss-of-function mutants show increased inflorescence meristem branching and develop carpels within the tassel  <cit> , indicating mir172e has a specific function. this could be a result of spatiotemporal expression differences between individual members of the mir <dig> family, or their targets, but does not rule out the possibility that only mir172e is functional. of the four rice mir <dig> members, mir172b has a mature mirna sequence identical to maize mir172e. in addition, the rice mir172b and maize mir172e are located in a syntenic region  <cit> ; therefore, it is of interest to know whether mir172b also plays a non-redundant role in inflorescence and spikelet development in rice and whether the other three members are expressed and functional in rice development.

expression analysis of the mature mir <dig> sequences and their precursors in different tissues and developmental stages might help determine where and when each mir <dig> member is likely to be expressed; however, distinguishing expression of individual mir <dig> family members using hybridization and pcr-based approaches is difficult because the four mirnas have few sequence differences. small rna sequencing is able to distinguish individual members with identical mature mirnas due to differences in the mirna* sequences. it has been shown that mir172b is expressed in seedlings and developing grains  <cit> , whereas mir172c is not detected in developing grains  <cit> . mir172a/d is detected in seedlings and developing grains but the mirna* is only detected for mir172d . these results suggest that mir172a might not be expressed in these two tissues. in our study, over-expression of mir172a did not show any visible mutant phenotype. this might be because the accumulation of mir <dig> in the mir172a over-expression plants was not sufficient to cause a phenotypic change . the reduced accumulation of mir <dig> could be because the transgene containing pre-mir172a is transcribed less efficiently than the pre-mir172b transgene, or as pre-mir172a is the least stable precursor  among the four mir <dig> precursors in rice, it may be cleaved by mir172a itself as shown in arabidopsis  <cit> . in arabidopsis, a mir172a mir172b  double mutant does not show any floral defects   <cit> . further work is needed to determine whether mir172a has a role in rice development.

CONCLUSIONS
over-expressing mir172b resulted in delayed transition from spikelet meristem to floret meristem and caused defects in floret development. this is a result of repression of snb and at least one of the other four target genes, most likely os03g <dig>  by the elevated levels of mir <dig> in plants over-expressing mir172b. our analyses of expression of mir <dig> and its target mrnas are consistent with it acting through transcriptional and/or translational repression with the latter as a possible predominant mode of action of mir <dig> in rice.
