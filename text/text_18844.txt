BACKGROUND
the rho-associated coiled-coil kinase- <dig>  is a large serine/threonine kinase that plays diverse roles in the cell including contraction, motility and morphology . in the absence of rho-gtp, rock <dig>  and its closely related homologue rock <dig>  adopts an auto-inhibited form  <cit> , and upon rho-gtp binding auto-inhibition is relieved and the kinase adopts an open, active conformation  <cit> . rho-gtp activates rock <dig> to alter the activity of the actin reorganization machinery. for example, rock <dig> activation indirectly increases myosin light chain  phosphorylation, through the phosphorylation and inactivation of mlc phosphatase   <cit> . rock <dig> can also directly phosphorylate mlc at ser <dig> <cit> , the same site targeted by mlc kinase. rock <dig> further causes the disruption of the head-to-tail association of erm proteins, through the phosphorylation of ezrin, radixin and moesin  <cit> . in addition, lim-kinase  <dig> is activated by rock <dig>  which then phosphorylates its downstream target, cofilin  <cit> . phosphorylation of cofilin inhibits its actin depolymerizing function, thus increasing the number of actin filaments and leads to reorganization of the cytoskeleton  <cit> .

many human cancers demonstrate increased rock <dig> activity, which can augment tumor invasiveness  <cit> . animal models have revealed that ectopic rock <dig> activation in established tumors is sufficient to drive metastasis of tumor cells into the surrounding stroma  <cit> . rock <dig> has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension, since rocks play a crucial role in smooth muscle contraction  <cit> , through phosphorylation of mlc and mlcp. furthermore, rock <dig> has been shown to influence the expression of genes that are important in vascular function, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor- <dig>   <cit>  and osteopontin  <cit> . since rock <dig> plays a role in a number of human diseases, this kinase has received considerable interest as a potential therapeutic target.

rock <dig> is a member of the agc kinase family and shares homology within the catalytic domain with other agc kinase members including pka, pkb, pkc, s6k, and sgk. this has led to the realization that rock <dig>  like other agc kinases, could target sequences that fall within a characteristic phosphorylation motif of r/kxs/t or r/kxxs/t  <cit> . substrate preference for rock <dig> phosphorylation of this consensus motif is likely governed by spatial and temporal constraints; for example pka distinguishes bona fide substrates through a mechanism in which bridging between kinase and substrate is provided by adapter and scaffold molecules  <cit> .

to identify new rock <dig> substrates, a potentially useful approach is to modify the kinase so that it utilizes an atp molecule restricted from use by other kinases. for example, an atp with a bulky hydrophobic group attached to the n <dig> position of the purine base prevents entry of the analog into the catalytic site of most protein kinases  <cit> . the kinase domain can be engineered to accept this analog by introducing a modification to sterically accommodate the atp analog. this chemical engineering approach was first demonstrated in the prototypical protein tyrosine kinase v-src  <cit>  and has been adapted to various kinases leading to the discovery of many important new substrates  <cit> .

here, we have adapted this chemical engineering approach to rock <dig>  we show that a modified rock <dig> harboring a single amino acid substitution in the catalytic domain resulted in a 100-fold decrease in the km for n6atp utilization compared with wildtype kinase. phosphorylation of a cellular homogenate with γ32p-n6atp led to a mixture of highly phosphorylated proteins that were separated by 2d-gel electrophoresis. mass spectral identification and biochemical analysis of one of these phosphorylated proteins, eukaryotic elongation factor-1-α- <dig> , demonstrated the utility of this approach and provides an important reagent for the future identification of rock <dig> signaling targets.

RESULTS
generation of as-rock2
we were interested in identifying atp binding-pocket mutations within rock <dig> that permitted the use of bulky atp analogs. to screen for these mutations, we developed an in vitro nonradioactive assay based on phosphorylation of a biotinylated rock <dig> substrate peptide matching the consensus rock <dig> phosphorylation site in limk. following phosphorylation in vitro by rock <dig>  the biotinylated limk peptides were bound to a  <dig> well streptavidin-coated plate and phosphorylation was measured by probing with a commercially available phospho-specific antibody coupled to a secondary antibody conjugated to an 680 nm wavelength fluorochrome . detection of the phospho-peptide antibody complex was performed directly on-plate using the licor odyssey infrared laser scanner. the assay was simple, rapid, and had a wide dynamic range comparing phospho-thr <dig> limk fluorescence with the non-phosphorylated limk peptide . the unphosphorylated peptide was unreactive to the phosphospecific antibody up to the maximal concentration tested of 4 μg/ml.

for rock <dig>  met <dig> is analogous to ile <dig> in v-src , where this single bulky residue of v-src was shown to prevent the acceptance of n6-modified atp analogues  <cit> . mutation of the met <dig> residue in rock <dig> to an alanine or glycine was modeled to yield the space required to accommodate n6atp. this mutation was introduced into the w1161a rock <dig> background as we have previously shown that this protein exhibits high kinase activity levels  <cit> . the met <dig> to ala substitution resulted in a 4-fold increase in substrate phosphorylation over wildtype rock <dig> at an n6atp concentration of 100 μm . the met <dig> to gly substitution had a 50% reaction velocity compared with the wildtype sequence, while met <dig> to val <dig> substitution also resulted in a major decrease in reaction velocity, indicating that these substitutions are inhibitory.

since the met <dig> mutation resulted in a greater velocity at 100 μm n6atp than wildtype rock <dig>  we analyzed this protein over a concentration range of analog to estimate km for n6atp. we saw no difference in the km concentration of atp between wildtype rock <dig> and ala <dig> rock <dig>  . in contrast, there was a 100-fold decrease in km for n6atp between the two kinases  .

eef1α <dig> is phosphorylated by as-rock <dig> in vitro
next, we utilized m160a/w1161a rock <dig> to phosphorylate hek <dig> cellular homogenate. cellular homogenate was incubated with m160a/w1161a rock <dig> in the presence γ32p-n6atp . in addition to autophosphorylated rock <dig>  numerous other 32p-labeled proteins were clearly observed by autoradiography. the phosphorylated protein homogenate was then fractionated by 2d-electrophoresis and figure 3b shows that at least eight proteins were phosphorylated by the exogenous m160a/w1161a rock <dig> protein. two spots in particular were labeled strongly , and one of them  was identified by mass spectroscopy to be the eukaryotic elongation initiation factor-1-α <dig> .

we noted three sites of eef1α <dig>  that fell within the rock consensus phosphorylation motif. these residues were exchanged for alanine and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay with w1161a rock <dig> . thr <dig> substitution of eef1α <dig> resulted in a 90% loss of phosphorylation, suggesting that thr <dig> is a major site of phosphorylation by rock <dig> 

the identification of new rock <dig> substrates is important for understanding how this essential regulator of cell mobility and contraction signals to control cellular events. our study has provided a number of useful advancements in this regard. first, the biotinylated limk peptide assay was developed to quickly and quantitatively assess rock <dig> activity in vitro with phospho-specific antibodies and without radioactivity. the biotinylated limk peptide assay could be useful in future research applications that seek to assess rock <dig> catalytic activity in vitro, such as testing the catalytic effects of point mutations or the discovery of small compound inhibitors of rock <dig> 

secondly, we have utilized the biotinylated limk peptide assay to evaluate a rock <dig> mutation that allows utilization of n6atp. since this bulky atp analog is not efficiently used by rock <dig>  or many other protein kinases  <cit> , the m160a rock <dig> protein represents a valuable tool for the future identification of novel rock <dig> substrates. this modified protein was able to phosphorylate the limk peptide in vitro, and was able to phosphorylate an array of proteins in a cellular lysate that could be separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and identification by mass spectroscopy. this resulted in the successful identification of the putative rock <dig> substrate eukaryotic elongation initiation factor-1α- <dig> . the eef1α <dig> is a highly conserved gtp-binding protein that interacts with aminoacyl-trna and recruits it to the ribosome during peptide elongation  <cit> . in addition to this role, eef1α <dig> has also been found to be a part of a diverse number of cellular activities, including interactions with actin  <cit>  mitotic apparatus complex formation  <cit> , association with phosphorylated pkb  <cit> , and interactions with pdk <dig>  <cit> .

izawa and colleagues reported that eef1α phosphorylation inhibited co-sedimentation with f-actin  <cit> . eef1α binds f-actin or aminoacyl-trna in a competitive manner  <cit> . thus, eef1α phosphorylation by rock may release the elongation factor from the cytoskeleton, allowing binding of aminoacyl-trna, leading to localized translation  <cit> . other studies have since shown that overexpression of eef1α <dig> leads to filopodia formation in human breast cancer cells, which was reversed with the rock <dig> inhibitor y- <dig>  <cit> . these results argue that further investigation is required to elucidate whether eef1α <dig> represents a physiological rock <dig> substrate.

examination of the eef1α <dig> protein sequence revealed that residues ser <dig>  thr <dig>  and thr <dig> all fall within a rock <dig> consensus motif r/kxs/t or r/kxxs/t   <cit> . individual mutation of these residues to alanine followed by in vitro phosphorylation by rock <dig> showed that thr <dig> is the major site of rock <dig> phosphorylation, since minimal phosphorylation was observed with t432a eef1α <dig> . future work will involve the generation of a phospho-specific antibody to thr <dig> of eef1α <dig> that will aid in elucidating the role of phosphorylation at this residue in cells.

amano and colleagues  <cit>  have previously reported an alternative proteomic approach to identify substrates of rock <dig>  by combining mass spectrometry with affinity column chromatography. this method utilized the catalytic domain of rock <dig> as bait to probe a fraction of cytosol for interacting proteins  <cit> , where our atp analogue approach relies on a full-length protein that specifically phosphorylates substrates. both techniques are similar in that proteins of interest were first separated from non-substrates, followed by identification by mass spectrometry.

further identification of rock <dig> substrates using the atp analogue approach will focus on specifically enriching for proteins phosphorylated by the as-rock <dig> protein. this could be achieved by utilizing an n6-atp-γ-s analogue and substrate enrichment with iodoacetyl-agarose resin, which binds the sulfonated group  <cit> , prior to identification by mass spectrometry.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our work has shown the utility of an as-rock <dig> mutation that allows the use of bulky atp analogs. this model will be of significant value for future efforts aimed at identifying novel rock <dig> substrates that could play a role in human disease such as cancer and hypertension.
