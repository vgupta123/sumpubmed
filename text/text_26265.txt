BACKGROUND
several biotin-binding proteins have been characterized from egg-laying vertebrates. the best known of these proteins is chicken avidin   <cit> . this tetrameric ~ <dig> kda egg-white protein, together with its bacterial homologs streptavidin and bradavidin  <cit> , has a fascinating feature, the ability to bind a small water soluble vitamin, d-biotin , with tremendous affinity   <cit> . the formation of the extraordinary strong protein-ligand complex is a result of "perfect" structural complementarity between the avidin ligand-binding site and btn  <cit> , and optimized "packing" of the overall tertiary and quaternary structure, too  <cit> . although btn is thought to be the natural ligand of avidin, these proteins are known to bind naturally-occurring as well as synthetic btn analogous and their derivatives, which include the biotechnologically valuable 2-iminobiotin, 4'-hydroxyazobenzene-2-carboxylic acid  and desthiobiotin . however, avidin has clearly weaker affinity for ligands other than btn. the biological role of avd is still partially unclear, but it has been postulated to function as an antimicrobial defence protein in chicken by ensuring that no free biotin is present in egg white; a vitamin required for the growth of bacteria  <cit> . nevertheless, it is the numerous biotechnological applications, where avd's unique biotin-binding property has been utilized, which have made avd one of the most well-known proteins.

in addition to avd of chicken egg-white, other proteins capable of binding btn tightly, biotin-binding protein i   <cit>  and ii   <cit>  of chicken egg-yolk, have been reported. nothing is known about the affinity of bbp-i/ii for ligands other than btn. although immunologically similar and having comparable n-terminal sequences  <cit> , bbp-i and bbp-ii differ in their thermal stability, bbp-i being more stable than bbp-ii  <cit> . the biological functions of the two bbp forms are only partly resolved, but they are known to be synthesized in the liver and believed to transport btn via plasma to the egg-yolk  <cit> . more specifically, it is believed that bbp-i has a general role as a transport protein in hen plasma, whereas bbp-ii may be needed for the efficient deposition of btn into the yolk of maturating oocytes  <cit> .

there is a substantial evidence that the quaternary structure of bbp-i/ii is tetrameric, but it is not clear whether the tetramers are formed as a result of assembling four monomers or if the tetramers result from limited proteolysis of a single polypeptide containing all the binding sites  <cit> . evidence for the former hypothesis became available when the putative genes and cdnas encoding the bbp-i/ii proteins were reported in  <dig> by niskanen and co-workers  <cit> : the exon-intron structures of the bbp genes  <cit> , named as bbp-a and bbp-b, mimic those of avd and avidin-related genes   <cit>  and they encode proteins with a single ligand binding site per polypeptide chain. it is worth mentioning that it is not yet completely clear whether the bbp-a and bbp-b genes really encode for either of the earlier characterized bbp-i and bbp-ii proteins; bbp-a in particular seems to encode a novel protein, bbp-a, not characterized before  <cit> .

in the present study, we show that the chicken bbp-a gene encodes a functional homotetrameric protein. we report two different x-ray structures of bbp-a, one in complex with btn and an other one in complex with d-biotin d-sulfoxide , at  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å resolution, respectively. to our knowledge, no other structures of any proteins in complex with bso have been reported before. using several biochemical methods, we show that bbp-a binds bso even tighter than btn. a comparative study of the ligand-binding and physicochemical properties of bbp-a and avd are presented together with data from site-directed mutagenesis.

RESULTS
biochemical characterization of bbp-a
bbp-a, expressed both in e. coli  and in insect cells , was isolated and purified using 2-iminobiotin affinity chromatography. a typical yield was  <dig> mg of pure protein per one litre of culture medium for both expression systems. the mutations a74s and t118f, which were made in order to study the differences in the molecular origin of the biotin-binding affinity and the thermal stability of bbp-a as compared to chicken avd, had no significant effect on the protein yields. the isolated proteins were shown to be over 95% pure using sds-page analysis . a molecular weight of  <dig>  da was determined for the expressed bbbp-a using mass spectrometry, and it matched the molecular weight calculated from the expression construct.

the oligomeric state of bbbp-a, bbbp-a, bbbp-a, ibbp-a, bavd and wtavd in solution was analysed using gel filtration chromatography. all of the proteins eluted as single peaks in this analysis, demonstrating the homogeneity of the samples. the apparent molecular weights of ibbp-a  and wtavd , based on gel filtration analysis, corresponded well with the theoretical molecular weights for their respective tetramers. as expected, the proteins produced in bacterial cells showed apparent molecular weights lower than the corresponding proteins expressed in insect cells, at least partially due to the absence of glycosylation . the mutations a74s and t118f had no effect on the appearance of bbp-a in the gel filtration analysis. nor did the addition of btn to the samples significantly alter the apparent molecular masses of the analysed proteins. this, together with the results showing that btn significantly stabilizes tetramers of bbbp-a , supports the idea that the quaternary structure of bbbp-a is tetrameric, an idea that is also supported by the crystal structures of bbbp-a – bso and bbbp-a – btn .

the amino acid sequence of bbp-a contains one putative n-glycosylation site , which corresponds to an n-glycosylation site known to be present and glycosylated in avd  <cit> . to see whether ibbp-a was also glycosylated, the protein was treated with endoglycosidase h and analysed on sds-page . after the deglycosylation treatment, the ibbp-a protein had a molecular weight comparable to that of bbbp-a, a molecular weight clearly lower than the molecular weight of the untreated ibbp-a sample. this result, together with the control data , indicates that the n-glycosylation site of bbp-a was indeed glycosylated in insect cells and the size of the attached carbohydrate is comparable to that present on wtavd.

the immunological cross-reactivity of bbp-a and wtavd was studied with two polyclonal antibodies made against chicken avd . neither of the antibodies did cross-react with bbp-a in a western blotting analysis. the reactivity of both antibodies was significantly weaker with ibbp-a  than in the case of a 100-fold dilution of wtavd . in dot-blot analysis, only one antibody, the tdaviii antibody, was used to test whether it detects ibbp-a and bbbp-a. in agreement with the immunoblot analysis, no or only negligible cross-reactivity was observed.

stability of the tetrameric assembly of bbp-a
the thermal stability of the tetrameric form of bbp-a was analysed in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol using an sds-page-based method described in  <cit> . both bbbp-a and ibbp-a appeared mainly in monomeric forms on sds-page gels already at room temperature in the absence of btn, whereas addition of btn stabilised the tetrameric form, which was stable until the temperature was raised to 70°c . in the presence of btn, glycosylated ibbp-a had slightly better thermal stability  compared to bbbp-a . both bbbp-a and ibbp-a were clearly more thermally labile than wtavd. the mutations a74s and t118f had no significant effect on the stability of the tetrameric forms of bbbp-a .

differential scanning calorimetry  was not applicable to the bbbp-a forms in the absence of ligands, since a clear, single denaturation temperature could not be measured for these proteins. for bbbp-a, two peaks at around 51°c and 68°c were obtained. in the presence of btn, however, the value of tm was around 100°c for all bbbp-a forms. these values are significantly lower in comparison to those measured for wtavd . furthermore, the thermal stability of bbbp-a and avd was analysed in the presence of bso and d-biotin sulfone . only negligible differences were, however, found between the effects of these two ligands and btn on the thermal stabilities of bbbp-a and avd.

the overall x-ray structures of bbp-a
the crystal structures of bbbp-a in complex with btn and bso were solved at  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å resolution, respectively. the statistics for the structure determinations are summarized in table  <dig>  the overall bbp-a – btn and bbp-a – bso structures are practically identical to each other; the cα atoms of these structures superimpose with an rmsd of <  <dig>  Å. the bbp-a structures consist of four identical subunits, each subunit adopting a β-barrel fold of eight anti-parallel β-strands with an α-helix positioned between the β7- and β8-strands . the btn/bso-binding site is located at the open end of each β-barrel. the overall fold of bbp-a is similar to that seen for the known structures of the avd family complexes, i.e. streptavidin-btn  <cit> , avd-btn  <cit> , avr2-btn  <cit>  and avr4-btn  <cit>  complexes. the solvent accessible surface area is, however, over 10% larger in the bbp-a structures  compared to the avd-btn structures . the electrostatic surface properties of bbp-a and avd differ, too, bbp-a having a seemingly more positively charged surface than avd .

mode of btn and bso binding
the biotin-binding site of the bbp-a – btn structure mimics the biotin-binding site of avd  <cit> . the amino acid residues within  <dig> Å of btn in the complex with bbp-a  are not only highly conserved but also have conformations similar to those seen in avd . actually, only one polar  and one hydrophobic residue  within  <dig> Å of btn are not conserved between the bbp-a – btn and avd-btn complex  structures. the side-chain oxygen of glu <dig> of bbp-a is hydrogen bonded to one of the valeric oxygen atoms of btn, whereas in avd the equivalent residue, ser <dig>  can not form a hydrogen bond to the valeric oxygen because the distance between the two atoms is too long . the methyl carbon of ala <dig> of bbp-a, on the other hand, is positioned only  <dig>  Å away from the valeric o10b atom of btn , but is not likely to be hydrogen bonded with btn unlike the side-chain oxygen atom of the corresponding ser <dig> in avd, which is hydrogen bonded to btn.

in addition to the bbp-a – btn complex structure, we solved the x-ray structure of bbp-a – bso, too. to our knowledge, bso is not found in any other protein structure presently within the protein data bank   <cit> . electron density for the bso ligand was clearly seen in the difference map of the bbp-a – bso structure . the binding mode of bso to bbp-a is surprisingly similar to that of btn  despite the additional oxygen atom that is covalently linked to the sulphur atom of the bicyclic ring system of bso but is missing from btn. the distance between the sulfur atom of btn and the og <dig> atom of thr <dig> , for example, is very close to the bso – thr <dig> distance . in the known avd-btn complex structures , the corresponding distances are  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å. the only noticeable difference around the ligands in the two bbp-a structures was found at glu <dig>  which in the bbp-a – btn structure is hydrogen bonded to the valeric o10a atom of btn but in the bbp-a – bso structure was observed either to form a salt bridge with arg <dig>  or to hydrogen bond to a structural water molecule . the difference in the conformation of glu <dig> is not likely to result from the varying crystal contacts of the two bbp-a structures that crystallized as different space groups . moreover, the overall conformations of the btn and bso ligands bound to bbp-a were very similar, too.

subunit interfaces of bbp-a
comparing bbp-a with avd, we saw differences at subunit interfaces 1– <dig> and 1– <dig>  whereas the amino acid residues found at the 1– <dig> interface were conserved and had similar conformations .

of the three residues  within  <dig> Å from each other at the 1– <dig> subunit interface of the bbp-a – bso structure , valine and glycine are conserved between bbp-a and avd, while thr <dig> is replaced by ile <dig> in the avd structure. in bbp-a there is no interaction equivalent to the hydrophobic or van der waals interactions introduced by the two met <dig> residues of avd at the 1– <dig> subunit interface: in bbp-a, met <dig> is replaced by ala <dig> and the distance between ala <dig> in the two subunits is about  <dig> Å. generally, the 1– <dig> subunit interface seems to be more loosely packed in bbp-a compared to avd, avr <dig>  <cit>  and even avr <dig>  <cit>  .

the total contact surface area of the 1– <dig> interface of bbp-a – bso is  <dig> Å <dig>  whereas the corresponding contact surface area in avd is  <dig> Å <dig>  twenty-six of the  <dig> amino acid residues found at the 1– <dig> interface within a contact radius of  <dig> Å are different between the bbp-a – bso and avd-btn  structures. hydrophobic residues located at the core of the 1– <dig> subunit interfaces are well conserved in bbp-a and avd, whereas several differences among the polar residues were observed, especially at the interacting loop regions . the hydrogen bond found in avd between the oe <dig> atom of glu <dig> of the β <dig> sheet and the ne <dig> nitrogen of his <dig> of the β <dig> sheet, for example, is not seen in bbp-a where glu <dig> and his <dig> are respectively replaced by thr <dig> and lys <dig>  the hydrogen bond formed between the side-chain atoms of gln <dig>  and glu <dig>  in bbp-a is, in turn, missing from avd, where the residues are replaced by thr <dig> and ser <dig>  yet another example of the differences at the 1– <dig> subunit region between bbp-a and avd was seen for the only α-helix and the β7-strand of these structures: in bbp-a the side-chain oxygen atom of glu <dig> can form hydrogen bonds with the ne and nh <dig> atoms of the side chain of arg <dig>  whereas the atoms of the respective residues, lys <dig> and ile <dig>  of avd may introduce only van der waals contacts. these and other differences  reflect the varying architecture of the 1– <dig> interfaces in bbp-a and avd.

ligand-binding analyses
the dissociation rate of biotin from bbp-a was measured using a competitive dissociation assay . the analysis showed that bbbp-a has a dissociation rate about 100-fold higher than that of avd  <cit> , indicating that the affinity for btn is lower in bbbp-a compared to avd, but similar to that of streptavidin  <cit> . the dissociation rate of the fluorescent btn conjugate arcdia™ bf560-biotin was, in turn, about 30-fold higher for bbbp-a compared to wtavd . interestingly, ibbp-a had an almost three-fold slower dissociation rate compared to bbbp-a. wtavd showed a higher dissociation rate compared to the bavd form produced in e. coli, which is in line with previously reported observations  <cit> . the a74s and t118f mutations of bbp-a did not significantly affect the biotin-binding properties of bbp-a .

the biotin-binding characteristics of bbbp-a and wtavd studied by itc analysis were similar for both proteins. because the binding of btn was tight  in both cases, the binding constants could not be determined directly from the itc data . the binding enthalpy could, however, be accurately determined, and the obtained values are listed in table  <dig>  in addition to btn, the binding of bso and d-biotin sulfone to wtavd and bbbp-a were analysed using itc . the oxidised btn forms exhibited a slightly higher binding enthalpy compared to btn for both proteins studied. overall, ligand binding to avd released more heat, but a rather similar variation in the binding enthalpies of the studied ligands was observed in bbp-a and avd. therefore, the itc analysis of the enthalpy of binding does not suggest different ligand preferences for bbp-a and avd.

the ligand-induced changes to the emission spectra of bbbp-a and wtavd were studied, too . all biotin forms, btn, bso and d-biotin sulfone, enhanced the emission intensity of bbp-a. in contrast, only d-biotin sulfone increased the emission intensity of avd, whereas bso and especially btn decreased the emission intensity of avd. compared to the ligand-free proteins, for each of the ligand-protein combinations the maximum in the emission spectra moved towards the shorter blue wavelengths. altogether, these results indicate differences in the ligand-protein interactions between bbp-a and avd, particularly reflecting variation in the local environment of tryptophan residues  <cit> .

est database search
chicken est databases were searched using ncbi blastn  <cit>  and the bbp-a and avd cdnas as query sequences. the search resulted in  <dig> significant  hits in the case of bbp-a, whereas the cdna of avd yielded  <dig> hits. further analysis of the bbp-a hits showed that they correspond to mrnas isolated from kidney and the adrenal glands , the trunks of chicken stage  <dig> embryos  and multiple-tissue preparations . the avd hits, in turn, corresponded to mrnas isolated from lymphoid tissues , intestine , ovary , the chondrocytes of cartilage , multiple-tissue preparations , splenic t cells , pituitary gland, hypothalamus and pineal gland , and pbl macrophages .

discussion
here, we report the biochemical and structural characterization of bbp-a, produced efficiently both in e. coli and spodoptera frugiperda cells. this study demonstrates that bbp-a can be classified as a new member of the avd family: bbp-a binds btn with high affinity like all the other known members of the family  <cit>  and has the β-barrel fold characteristic of avd and of the more heterogeneous calycin superfamily of proteins  <cit> . the binding mode of btn to bbp-a  is also highly similar to that observed in the known structures of avd  <cit> , avr <dig>  <cit>  and avr <dig>  <cit> . the bbp-a protein is, however, biochemically and structurally clearly distinguishable from chicken avd and the avrs  <cit> . there are also differences in the immunological properties of bbp-a and avd, since immunoblot and dot-blot analyses with polyclonal avd antibodies did not show cross-reactivity between bbp-a and avd .

does bbp-a represent the earlier reported bbps, bbp-i or bbpii? based on the biochemical characterization of bbp-i  <cit> , and bbp-ii  <cit> , this seems not to be the case. the -biotin dissociation rate constant of bbp-i reported in  <dig> by meslar and co-workers  <cit>  is 2– <dig> times higher than that determined for bbbp-a and even 5– <dig> times higher in comparison to the glycosylated ibbp-a, which has a dissociation rate of biotin  in the same range as reported for streptavidin  <cit> . the pi  of the bbp-i protein differs from that calculated for bbp-a , too. moreover, the reported n-terminal sequences of bbp-i and bbp-ii do not match the sequence of bbp-a  <cit> . in conclusion, the bbp-a protein reported here seems to be a novel protein not described in any previous publications.

in order to study the molecular details of ligand recognition by bbp-a and compare the ligand-binding properties of bbp-a with the previously determined structures of avd  <cit> , streptavidin  <cit> , avr <dig>  <cit>  and avr <dig>  <cit> , we crystallized bbbp-a in complex with btn. surprisingly, in one of the two bbp-a crystals that were analyzed, bso was found bound to bbp-a even though only btn was added in the co-crystallisation experiments. to our knowledge, this complex is unique, as no other protein structure has been reported in complex with bso. what can be the source of the bound bso? based on the crystallization conditions , it is not easy to say why one structure bound btn and the other bso. it is known that some btn preparations may carry minor amounts of bso  <cit> , but based on mass spectrometry analysis  no detectable amounts of bso were found in the diluted btn solution that was used for crystallization. one possibility is that the source of the bso ligand seen in the bbp-a – bso structure is btn that had undergone oxidation during crystallization. another possibility is that bbp-a had itself converted btn to bso by some yet unknown catalytic mechanism, but experimental proof for this hypothesis is lacking and the final explanation for the presence of bso in one of the bbp-a structures remains to be studied.

the bbp-a – bso structure inspired us to investigate whether bbp-a recognizes bso with altered affinity in comparison to btn. we analysed the binding of the fully oxidised sulfone form of btn, too. to our surprise, the dissociation rate of bso  from bbp-a was similar or even slower than the dissociation rate of btn , whereas in the case of avd the dissociation rate of bso was more than  <dig> times higher in comparison to btn , whereas the dissociation of btn was determined using radiobiotin assay at 50°c ).

this is the first reported case, to our knowledge, where the product of a naturally occurring gene encoding a btn binder shows equally high affinity to a ligand other than btn. based on dsc analysis the studied ligands did not differ significantly in their effect on the thermal stability of bbp-a and avd . nor did the measured binding enthalpies vary significantly over ligand sets between avd and bbp-a . overall, these ligand binding analyses suggest that all the studied ligands are efficiently associated  with bbp-a and avd. however, the determined dissociation rate of btn from avd was significantly lower than the dissociation rates of bso and d-biotin sulfone, whereas the observed dissociation rates of the same ligands from bbp-a were rather similar to each other, the slowest observed for bso. as a conclusion, it is the different dissociation rather than association rates that determines the ligand-binding preferences of bbp-a and avd; out of the three ligands studied, avd prefers btn, whereas bbp-a seems to prefer bso. moreover, it is well known that the extremely slow dissociation of btn from avd is the main determinant of the high affinity binding  <cit> .

one possible explanation for the differences in the dissociation rates of the studied ligands is the weaker structural stability of bbp-a as compared to avd . it has been experimentally shown, that binding of btn to streptavidin lowers the rate of h/d exchange in large parts of the structure  <cit>  at least partially due to the positive structural cooperativity in the binding process , i.e. improved packing and compactness of not only the ligand-binding site but of entire subunits, too. the weaker stability, or lower level of "compactness", of the entire bbp-a tetramer can therefore explain the differences in the observed ligand-binding properties of avd and bbp-a. the bbp-a barrel fold may also be considered more flexible or dynamic than the avd barrel, which could lead to a higher rate at which btn is dislodged from the binding pocket, possibly by a mechanism similar to that presented by hyre et al. for streptavidin  <cit> .

what are the structural determinants that specify the recognition of bso and why does the affinity of bso meet that of btn for bbp-a? the bbp-a – bso structure is strikingly similar to the bbp-a – btn structure – even the additional d-sulfoxide moiety of the ligand in the bbp-a – bso structure does not seem to alter the binding pocket of bbp-a as compared to the bbp-a – btn structure . one clear difference can, however, be detected: the hydrogen bond present in the bbp-a – btn complex structure between glu <dig> and btn is missing in the bbp-a – bso structure due to the different conformation of glu <dig> in the two structures. moreover, in the bbp-a – bso structure, the carboxylate side-chain of glu <dig> forms a salt-bridge with the guanidinium group of the arg <dig> side-chain within the same subunit  or is hydrogen bonded to a structural water molecule , interactions that are not seen in the bbp-a – btn complex. arg <dig> is one of the conserved amino acids found at the 1– <dig> subunit interfaces of all known structures of members of the avd family, but its conformation varies within the family . this suggests that, in addition to the residues at the ligand-binding pocket, the type and conformation of residues at the subunit interfaces may regulate ligand binding, e.g. by allowing or disabling alternative hydrogen bonding networks.

CONCLUSIONS
our present study reveals that chicken has an avidin-like protein, bbp-a in its biotin-binding repertoire. even though similar to avd according to its three-dimensional structure and biotin-binding properties, i.e. the high affinity for btn, bbp-a has several unique features – the thermal stability and immunological cross-reactivity of bbp-a is very different as compared to avd. furthermore, bbp-a is the first example of a protein from the avd family that naturally has equally high affinity for btn and for a non-btn ligand. the biological function of bbp-a is not known, but since it binds both bso and btn with high affinity, it may have a function in the storage or delivery of btn to an embryo as has been suggested in earlier studies for bbp-i and bbp-ii  <cit> . in addition to providing clues of biological function and information about biotin-binding determinants in proteins, the high-resolution structure and biochemical analysis of bbp-a makes this novel protein attractive material for protein engineering and biotechnological applications. for example, bbp-a could be covalently combined with avd or avr polypeptide using a circular permutation strategy  <cit>  or used as a scaffold in the development of artificial enzymes  <cit> .
