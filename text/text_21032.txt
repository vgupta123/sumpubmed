BACKGROUND
actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the etiological agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, a severe and often fatal respiratory disease of swine, which is associated with significant economic losses in industrialized pig production worldwide  <cit> . to date,  <dig> serovars of a. pleuropneumoniae have been identified  <cit> . the pathogenesis of a. pleuropneumoniae infection is associated with several virulence factors, including but not limited to exotoxins. other factors, such as capsular polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides, adhesins, proteases, outer-membrane proteins, and transcriptional regulators, are also reported to be involved in its pathogenesis .

bacterial lipoproteins are a set of membrane-associated proteins characterized by a conserved lipid-modified cysteine, which play important roles in bacterial physiological processes  <cit> . the involvement of lipoproteins in the infection processes of many pathogens has received wide attention  <cit> . lipoproteins play a key role in the bacterium’s adhesion to the host cell, are involved in antibiotic resistance, and regulate the host immune response  <cit> . they have been reported to be pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which are recognized and captured by toll-like receptors or other pattern-recognition receptors, inducing the activation of the immune cells and initiating the inflammatory processes  <cit> . many immunogenic bacterial lipoproteins have been developed as candidate vaccines  <cit> .

a putative lipoprotein, lip <dig>  containing the tandemly repeated sequence qqpk was observed among the  <dig> putative lipoproteins predicted from the published genomic sequence of a. pleuropneumoniae strain jl <dig>  the lip <dig> gene from an a. pleuropneumoniae field isolate, slw <dig> , was cloned and characterized, including its sequence features, predicted structure, immunogenicity, subcellular localization, expression after stimulation, and protective efficiency in mice, extending our understanding of this lipoprotein.

prediction of a. pleuropneumoniae lipoproteins
the previously sequenced and annotated a. pleuropneumoniae strain jl <dig> was selected to identify the lipoproteins of a. pleuropneumoniae  <cit> . the programs used for lipoprotein prediction were:  scanprosite   <cit> ;  dolop   <cit> ;  signalp  <dig>    <cit> ;  predisi   <cit> ;  phobius   <cit> ; and  lipop  <dig>    <cit> . possible lipoproteins were then subjected to a ‘majority vote’ selection procedure to exclude any false positive lipoproteins  <cit> .

cloning and bioinformatic analysis of lip <dig> protein
the genomic dna was isolated from a. pleuropneumoniae slw <dig> as described previously  <cit> . specific primers for the lip <dig> gene were designed according to the conserved features of the lip <dig> sequence in the complete a. pleuropneumoniae genome. the lip <dig> gene was cloned by pcr, and the product was inserted into pmd18-t , generating the plasmid pmd-lip <dig>  the fragment inserted into pmd-lip <dig> was sequenced in both directions. the sequence features were analyzed with lipop  <dig> . a multiple sequence alignment was constructed with bioedit . the structure of lip <dig> was predicted by with the swiss-model method , and the lip <dig> protein was superimposed onto the n lobe and c lobe of tbpb  with wincoot.

reverse transcription–real-time quantitative pcr 
total rna was extracted from an a. pleuropneumoniae culture with the rneasy mini kit , treated with dnase i , and reverse-transcribed into cdna with the omniscript® rt kit , according to the manufacturer’s protocol. the mrna levels of a. pleuropneumoniae cultured under different conditions were measured with a sybr green-based method. the rluc gene was used as the internal control. qpcr was performed in a 20 μl reaction volume containing 10 μl of 2 × sybr green realtime pcr master mix , 1 μl of cdna,  <dig>  μl each of the forward and reverse primers , and 8 μl of dh2o. an abi  <dig> sequence detection system was used for the amplification reactions, and qpcr was performed in triplicate. the 2–ΔΔct method was used to calculate the relative expression of the lip <dig> gene.

expression and purification of lip <dig> from e. coli
the mature protein-coding sequence of lip <dig> was cloned from the a. pleuropneumoniae genomic dna using primers p <dig> and p <dig> . the pcr products were then digested with bamhi/hindiii and ligated into the prokaryotic expression vector pgex-kg  <cit> , generating the recombinant plasmid pgex-lip <dig>  recombinant lip <dig>  was then expressed from pgex-lip <dig> in e. coli bl <dig>  rlip <dig> was collected from the e. coli lysate and purified with a glutathione –sepharose 4b column . the immunoreactivity of the purified rlip <dig> was verified with western blotting, using porcine convalescent serum directed against a. pleuropneumoniae as the primary antibody.

production of polyclonal antibodies against rlip40
two female new zealand white rabbits  were used to produce polyclonal antibodies directed against rlip <dig>  all the animal experiments in the present study were approved by the animal experiment committee of central china normal university. each rabbit was first injected intradermally with purified rlip <dig> . the purified protein  was emulsified with an equal volume of freund’s complete adjuvant . animals were subsequently injected three times, at 15-day intervals, with the same immunogen emulsified with incomplete freund’s adjuvant with the same regimen. antisera were collected 10 days after the third booster immunization.

the titers and specificity of the polyclonal antibodies were evaluated with a lip <dig> enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . briefly, flat-bottomed 96-well polystyrene elisa plates  were coated with  <dig>  μg of purified rlip <dig> diluted in 100 μl of coating buffer . the coated plates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline  plus  <dig>  % tween  <dig> , blocked at 37 °c for 1 h with blocking buffer , and then washed three times with pbst. for the elisa, 2 μl samples and 198 μl of pbst were added to each well in the first line of wells in the plate and 100 μl of pbst was added to the rest of the wells. the samples were diluted and incubated at 37 °c for 40 min. after four washes with pbst, 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase -conjugated secondary antibody , diluted 1: <dig> in pbst, was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °c for 30 min. after five washes, 100 μl of  <dig> ′, <dig> ′-tetramethylbenzidine color development solution  was added to each well. the plates were incubated at room temperature in the dark for approximately 10 min, and the catalytic reaction was then stopped with 50 μl of 1 % sds. the optical density was read at 630 nm  in an elisa reader .

subcellular localization of lip40
the subcellular fractionation of a. pleuropneumoniae was performed as described previously  <cit> . in brief, 1 l of bacterial culture was pelleted and resuspended in 10 ml of solution a . lysozyme was then added to the cell suspension to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, vortexed, and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. dh2o  was added to the swirling mixture before it was placed on ice. the cells were centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 45 min at 4 °c. the supernatant contained the periplasmic fraction. the pellet was resuspended in  <dig>  ml of ice-cold solution b , supplemented with 50 μl of dnase . the cells were broken by two passes at 108 pa. the unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min at 4 °c. the supernatant was then centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 4 h at 4 °c. the supernatant contained the cytoplasmic fraction and the pellet contained the crude membranes, which were collected separately. the crude membrane pellet was resuspended in 9 ml of solution c , and centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 30 min at 4 °c. the supernatant contained the cytoplasmic membrane fraction. the pellet, containing the outer membrane, was washed in 1 ml of solution c, centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 20 min at 4 °c, washed three times with 500 μl of dh2o, and stored at −20 °c. the extracellular proteins were precipitated from the filtered culture supernatant with trichloroacetic acid at 4 °c overnight, followed by centrifugation , and were washed six times with 1 ml of 96 % ethanol. the pellet was dried and redissolved in 400 μl of solution d , and stored at −20 °c. the subcellular localization of the lip <dig> protein was determined with western blotting using rabbit hyperimmune anti-rlip <dig> serum  as the primary antibody.

expression of lip <dig> protein under stress conditions
actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, cultured in tsb under normal conditions  for 3 h, was divided into four equal parts and incubated under anaerobic condition, or at 42 °c, 16 °c, 37 °c for another 3 h, respectively . the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the outer-membrane fractions were extracted as described above. the concentration of all outer-membrane samples prepared under different culture conditions were determined with a bca protein assay kit . equal volumes of the samples  were separated with 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. western blotting was performed with rabbit hyperimmune anti-rlip <dig> serum  as the primary antibody. the expression of lip <dig> was determined in triplicate. the expression levels of lip <dig> in the outer-membrane samples were determined according to the density of the bands, with the quantity one software.

vaccination and challenge of mice
the protective efficacy of rlip <dig> was tested in a mouse vaccination/challenge model. forty-eight 6-week-old specific-pathogen-free balb/c mice  were randomly allocated to four groups of  <dig> animals. apxi toxin was obtained from the supernatant of a. pleuropneumoniae strain  <dig>  cultures, as described previously  <cit> , and inactivated with  <dig>  % formaldehyde. group  <dig> was inoculated with pbs and used as the negative control; group  <dig> was vaccinated with 150 μg of rlip40; group  <dig> was vaccinated with 150 μg of inactivated apxi; and group  <dig> was vaccinated with a commercial trivalent inactivated vaccine . for groups  <dig> and  <dig>  the antigens were emulsified separately with complete freund’s adjuvant for the first immunization, and with incomplete freund’s adjuvant for the booster immunization. serum samples were collected before each immunization and before the mice were challenged, and assayed with the lip40-elisa, as described above, and an apxi-elisa, as described previously  <cit> . each group was intraperitoneally challenged with  <dig>  ×  <dig> colony-forming units of log-phase a. pleuropneumoniae slw <dig> 14 days after the second vaccination. the numbers of surviving mice were recorded every day for 5 days after the challenge.

RESULTS
sixty putative a. pleuropneumoniae lipoproteins
with the ‘majority vote’ approach  <cit> ,  <dig> of the  <dig> identified putative lipoproteins from a. pleuropneumoniae jl <dig> were predicted as lipoproteins, including some previously reported lipoproteins, such as tbpb   <cit>  and pala   <cit> , as well as several previously reported putative lipoproteins  <cit> , indicating that our prediction method and results are reliable. the sequence characteristics of the  <dig> lipoproteins are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  putative lipoprotein lip <dig>  containing a special n-terminal tandemly repeated sequence, was further investigated in the present study.

lip <dig> has a conserved lipoprotein domain
the lip <dig> gene from a. pleuropneumoniae slw <dig> was cloned and sequenced . the lip <dig> protein was predicted to have the typical characteristics of lipoproteins with the lipop  <dig>  program, and contains the recognition sequence for signal peptidase ii . the lipid modification site of lip <dig> was predicted to be located at cys <dig>  a multiple sequence alignment of lip <dig> and lipoproteins from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and cardiobacterium hominis showed that lip <dig> is homologous to those lipoproteins . it also displayed similarity with several transferrin-binding proteins  from pathogenic bacteria . the multiple sequence alignment showed that lip <dig> is homologous to both the n- and c-lobes of a. pleuropneumoniae tbpb . structural prediction revealed that the lip <dig> protein consists of an eight-stranded β barrel accompanied by a domain made up of four β strands . superimposition of lip <dig> onto the c lobe and n lobe of tbpb  indicated that they have high structural similarity . we also noted that lip <dig> contains a tandemly repeated sequence, qqpk, at its n-terminus. actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae strain slw <dig> lip <dig> has nine tandem repeats. the numbers of repeats in the lip <dig> homologues from other a. pleuropneumoniae strains were also calculated, and according to the available genome sequences of these strains, the repeat numbers differ among the different strains  .fig.  <dig> sequence alignment and structural prediction of lip <dig>  a sequence alignment of a. pleuropneumoniae lip <dig> and the n- and c-lobes of a. pleuropneumoniae tbpb . b overall structure of lip <dig> protein . the structure consists of an eight-stranded β barrel accompanied by a domain made up of four β strands. c superimposition of lip <dig> onto the tbpb n lobe . d superimposition of lip <dig> onto the tbpb c lobe 



transcription of lip <dig> is stimulated by stress
the expression of the lip <dig> gene was analyzed under in vitro growth conditions mimicking the environment during infection, including anaerobic conditions and high temperature . the expression of lip <dig> at low temperature  was also evaluated. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the transcription of the lip <dig> gene was significantly upregulated under stress relative to its transcription under normal culture conditions , and heat shock most strongly increased lip <dig> expression . these results indicate that lip <dig> is responsive to temperature and anaerobic stress, and might be involved in the bacterial infection process.fig.  <dig> transcription changes in the a. pleuropneumoniae lip <dig> gene under different conditions. relative expression of the lip <dig> gene during stimulation with 42 °c, anaerobic conditions, or 16 °c was normalized to that of lip <dig> expressed under normal culture conditions. the fold changes in lip <dig> expression are shown. error bars indicate standard errors. double asterisks indicate p <  <dig> , calculated with student’s t test



rlip <dig> is immunoreactive
to express the lip <dig> protein, the lip <dig> gene without the signal peptide was cloned from a. pleuropneumoniae slw <dig>  restricted, and ligated into the prokaryotic expression plasmid pgex-kg. escherichia coli cells containing pgex-lip <dig> were induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. the recombinant lip <dig> protein was confirmed to be present in the soluble supernatant of the cell lysate with sds-page, as shown in fig. 3a. the purification of rlip <dig> is shown in fig. 3b. western blotting revealed a band with a molecular weight of ~56 kda for rlip <dig>  whereas no signal was detectable for gst . this result confirms that porcine convalescent serum directed against a. pleuropneumoniae recognized and bound specifically to the rlip <dig> protein.fig.  <dig> expression , purification , and western blotting analysis  of rlip <dig> protein. protein samples were separated with 12 % sds-page and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. the membrane was sequentially incubated with porcine convalescent serum directed against a. pleuropneumoniae and hrp-labeled goat anti-porcine igg secondary antibody, and the color was developed with a  <dig> ′-diaminobenzidine  peroxidase substrate . m, prestained protein ladder ; lane  <dig>  gst; lane  <dig>  rlip40



lip <dig> elicits a strong humoral immune response in rabbits
rabbits were immunized with four doses of purified rlip <dig> by intradermal injection. serum samples were collected before each immunization and before euthanasia and the antibodies against rlip <dig> were tested with an elisa, to verify the generation of a lip40-specific immune response in rabbits. lip40-specific antibodies appeared two weeks after the first immunization, and then increased quickly after the second and third injections . at the end of the immunization regimen, titration of the rabbit sera  showed the highest reactivity, with an increase of up to 2 × 105-fold , suggesting that rlip <dig> stimulates a strong antibody response in rabbits. the same amount of purified gst was used to coat 96-well plates, and antibody directed against gst was evaluated with a gst-elisa, as described for the lip40-elisa. the gst-specific igg titer in the hyperimmune serum was only 1: <dig> , much lower than that of the lip40-specific antibody. therefore, it appears that lip <dig> played a major role in the elicitation of rabbit antibodies directed against the gst–lip <dig> fusion protein.

lip <dig> is located in the outer membrane
although bioinformatic analysis showed that lip <dig> is located on the outer membrane, experimental verification was required . subcellular fractions of a. pleuropneumoniae cells were extracted carefully, including the cytoplasmic proteins, periplasmic proteins, cytoplasmic membrane proteins, outer-membrane proteins , and extracellular proteins . a band corresponding to lip <dig>  was observed in the outer-membrane fraction with western blotting, as shown in fig. 4b. no lip <dig> signal was observed in the other subcellular fractions. our results confirm that lip <dig> localizes to the outer bacterial membrane.fig.  <dig> subcellular localization of lip <dig>  a sds-page analysis of a. pleuropneumoniae subcellular fractions. b western blotting analysis. subcellular fractions were separated with 12 % sds-page, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with rabbit anti-rlip <dig> polyclonal antibody. color was developed with a dab peroxidase substrate . m, prestained protein ladder; lane  <dig>  cytoplasmic proteins ; lane  <dig>  periplasmic proteins ; lane  <dig>  cytoplasmic membrane proteins ; lane  <dig>  outer-membrane proteins ; lane  <dig>  extracellular proteins . the nitrocellulose membranes displayed a band with a molecular weight of ~30 kda in the outer-membrane fraction, indicating that lip <dig> is located on the outer membrane. no signal was detected in the other subcellular fractions



enhanced expression of lip <dig> protein under stress
to test whether the expression of lip <dig> protein in the outer-membrane fraction is stimulated by stress conditions, a. pleuropneumoniae cells cultured under anaerobic condition or high and low temperatures were collected, and their outer-membrane fractions were extracted and quantified. equal amounts of samples  were separated by sds-page, and the expression levels were determined with western blotting . in general, the expression of lip <dig> protein was enhanced under stress conditions, especially at 42 °c, and the lip <dig> signal increased more than three-fold under heat shock. these results indicate that both the transcription of the lip <dig> gene and the translation of the lip <dig> protein increased in response to stress. therefore, lip <dig> may be involved in the adaptation of a. pleuropneumoniae to environmental changes.fig.  <dig> expression changes of lip <dig> protein in the outer-membrane fraction. a sds-page. actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae outer-membrane samples were extracted from cells after they were treated with heating, anaerobic conditions, or cold stimulation, or with normal conditions. equal amounts  of outer-membrane proteins were analyzed with sds-page. b western blotting analysis. the procedures were as described above. m, prestained protein ladder; lane  <dig>  high temperature ; lane  <dig>  anaerobic conditions; lane  <dig>  low temperature ; lane  <dig>  normal conditions . c intensity of the bands was quantified with the quantity one software. relative expression levels were obtained by normalizing the intensity of stress-treated samples to that of untreated samples in each assay. double asterisks  indicate a significant difference  compared with the stress-treated samples 



lip <dig> is protective in mice
serum samples from mice immunized with different antigens were analyzed with elisas . all the mice were negative for rlip <dig> and apxi before immunization. serum samples from the mice inoculated with pbs  or apxi  showed no detectable antibody against lip <dig> during this study , whereas the sera from group  <dig>  vaccinated with rlip <dig>  were positive for lip <dig> antibodies 14 days after the first vaccination, and the titer had increased by the second vaccination. the lip <dig> antibody titers in group  <dig> were significantly higher than those in the other groups . the mice in groups  <dig> and  <dig> were also free of apxi antibodies, but the mice in group  <dig> showed a significantly stronger apxi antibody response than the other groups . as shown in fig. 6b, group  <dig>  vaccinated with commercial vaccine, also showed a strong apxi antibody response after vaccination. the mice were challenged with virulent a. pleuropneumoniae slw <dig> 14 days after the second immunization, and the survival rates were recorded for 5 days after challenge . no mice inoculated with pbs survived the challenge, and the protective efficacies of rlip <dig>  apxi, and commercial vaccine were 75 % , 100 % , and  <dig>  % , respectively. these results show that rlip <dig> protected more than half the animals  from the challenge. thus, the protective efficacy of rlip <dig> was significantly higher than that of the negative control , indicating that rlip <dig> is immunoprotective and provides effective protection against a. pleuropneumoniae infection in mice.fig.  <dig> humoral responses in mice. antibodies against rlip <dig>  and apxi  were evaluated at different time points with elisas. elisa titers are expressed as the logarithm  of the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum with an od <dig> value above that of the cutoff value for each mouse. double asterisks  indicate p <  <dig> , calculated with student’s t test

discussion
lipoproteins are required for the virulence of some pathogenic bacteria. they play a variety of roles in host–pathogen interactions, from surface adhesion and the initiation of inflammatory processes to the translocation of virulence factors into the host cytoplasm  <cit> . however, the pathogenesis of a. pleuropneumoniae lipoproteins has rarely been examined. most such studies have focused on their immunogenicity and vaccine potential, including studies of tbpb  and omla  <cit> . these proteins were shown to be immunoprotective and important vaccine components . however, pala was reported to inhibit the protective efficacy of apxi and apxii  <cit> .

in the present study, a putative lipoprotein, lip <dig>  which contains an interesting tandemly repeated sequence, qqpk, was characterized. previous studies have demonstrated the relationship between coding tandem repeat  sequences and virulence in chlamydia pecorum  <cit> . ctrs at the inca locus encode a variable number of repeated motifs, and the number of repetitions in inca is related to the virulence of c. pecorum strains  <cit> . similarly, the number of tandem repeats in lip <dig> varies within its homologues in different serovars of a. pleuropneumoniae strains. therefore, the possible role of lip <dig> in bacterial pathogenesis requires further characterization.

oxygen deprivation and high temperature are two common stresses that a. pleuropneumoniae encounters during infection  <cit> . transcriptional profiles under anaerobic conditions  <cit>  and acute disease  <cit>  have been analyzed with microarray chips to discover potential virulence factors, which are usually considered to be upregulated under in vivo conditions or in a mimicked infection. this genome-wide transcriptional screening of the differentially expressed genes of a. pleuropneumoniae revealed no lip <dig> homologue. in this study, we confirmed that lip <dig> is upregulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels by stress. the mechanisms involved in the adaptive responses of a. pleuropneumoniae remain to be investigated. the effects of cold shock were tested as a typical environmental stress. reports have suggested that the autumn–winter transition is one of the outbreak peaks of porcine pleuropneumonia in china  <cit> , and the environmental temperature is always far lower than the normal growth temperature for mesophilic bacteria during this period. it is possible that the adaptation of a. pleuropneumoniae to cold stress is responsible for the infections observed at this time of year. our results indicate that both the transcriptional and translational levels of lip <dig> were elevated at 16 °c compared with those at 37 °c, suggesting that lip <dig> is a factor in the responsiveness of a. pleuropneumoniae to low temperature. therefore, we hypothesize that lip <dig> is a potential virulence factor and involved in pathogen–environment and/or pathogen–host interactions.

commercial vaccines, including whole-cell bacterins and second-generation subunit vaccines, only confer partial protection against a. pleuropneumoniae infection  <cit> . therefore, it is essential that more effective vaccines be developed. the identification of conserved immunogenic antigens, especially outer-membrane-located proteins, will advance this purpose. several outer-membrane-associated proteins have been verified separately as vaccine components or candidate vaccines with various investigation methods, including tbpb, omla, ompp <dig>  ompa, and ompw  <cit> . in addition to their location on the outer bacterial membrane, many lipoproteins of gram-negative bacteria are considered to be efficient candidate vaccines  <cit> . the putative outer-membrane proteins and lipoproteins have been identified in the genome of pasteurella multocida, a great step forward in the development of a protective vaccine against fowl cholera  <cit> . similar research was undertaken in a. pleuropneumoniae, and several lipoproteins were cloned and their protective efficacies were investigated  <cit> . here, we report a putative lipoprotein, lip <dig>  confirmed to be an outer-membrane-localized stress-responsive factor. purified rlip <dig> induced strong antibody responses when it was administered to rabbits. mice vaccinated with rlip <dig> displayed a survival rate of 75 %, which was significantly higher than that of the negative control group , indicating that rlip <dig> can be used as a component of vaccine against a. pleuropneumoniae infection. our results provide additional confirmation of the importance of bacterial outer-membrane lipoproteins in vaccine development.

CONCLUSIONS
a putative lipoprotein, lip <dig>  from a. pleuropneumoniae was characterized and confirmed to be both immunogenic and localized to the outer membrane. its expression is responsive to temperature and anaerobic stimuli. lip <dig> was also shown to be a potential protective antigen for vaccine development. further investigation of the roles of lip <dig> in a. pleuropneumoniae infection should provide insight into the pathogenesis of this bacterium.
