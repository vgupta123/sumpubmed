BACKGROUND
mitochondrial complex i  is a multi-subunit and intricate proton pump that is responsible for the first step in the canonical respiratory chain - the oxidation of nadh and subsequent reduction of ubiquinone. investigations of ci structure in animals and fungi portray ci as an l-shaped complex consisting of a hydrophobic domain integrated into the inner mitochondrial membrane and a hydrophilic mitochondrial matrix domain that oxidizes nadh and transfers electrons along 8- <dig> fe-s clusters  <cit> . mitochondrial ci comprises 35- <dig> proteins , which are encoded in both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. conversely, the homologous ~550-kda bacterial ci consists of only  <dig> subunits  <cit> , suggesting a massive expansion of ci in eukaryotes.

the subunit composition of mitochondrial ci has been intensively studied in animals  <cit> , fungi  <cit>  and land plants/green algae  <cit> . comparative proteomic and genomic analyses of ci composition in these groups have provided insight into the evolution of mitochondrial ci: specifically, in all three groups, the 14-subunit 'bacterial core'  has been retained, while an additional 18-subunit 'eukaryotic core'  along with a variable number of lineage-specific proteins has been added  <cit> . few of the lineage-specific proteins are similar to other proteins of known function in available databases; however, in plants  <cit>  and green algae  <cit> , ci contains multiple proteins with high similarity to γ-type carbonic anhydrases , first described as a homotrimeric complex  in the methanogenic archaeon, methanosarcina thermophila  <cit> .

carbonic anhydrases are ubiquitous metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of co <dig> to hco3-. five evolutionarily unrelated ca classes  are currently known, suggesting that this important enzymatic mechanism has been invented independently multiple times. the γca class is among the most ancient, with homologs widespread in archaea and bacteria  <cit> ; however, in eukaryotes, γca homologs have been described from a phylogenetically narrow collection of species, comprising almost exclusively green algae and land plants, in association with ci. in this group, single-particle electron microscopy studies have demonstrated the presence of an additional ci domain  <cit> . this novel structure, likely representing the γca proteins, is associated with the inner membrane portion of ci and projects into the mitochondrial matrix. the function of γca proteins in ci remains enigmatic: thus far, carbonic anhydrase activity has not been detected biochemically. however, experiments in arabidopsis have demonstrated that expression of plant γcas is affected by co <dig> concentration  and that plant γca proteins bind inorganic carbon  <cit> . these functional observations, coupled to the apparent restriction of γcas to mitochondria of plant/green algal lineages, have prompted the proposal that ci γca proteins may have plant-specific functions; for instance, braun & zabaleta  <cit>  have suggested that γca proteins play an important role in chloroplast function via the generation of hco3- in the recycling of inorganic carbon for co <dig> fixation.

although γca proteins are not components of ci in animals and fungi , little is known about the composition of ci in the predominantly unicellular protists. because protists comprise the bulk of eukaryotic diversity, it is important to characterize ci from diverse lineages in order to understand fully the evolution of this protein complex. in particular, we cannot conclude that supposedly lineage-specific ci subunits are truly lineage-specific without knowledge of ci composition in the majority of eukaryotes. to this end, we have isolated an enzymatically active, ~940-kda native ci and an inactive, ~820-kda ci subcomplex  from the amoeboid protist acanthamoeba castellanii via blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and have carried out a characterization of subunit composition via tandem mass spectrometry . here we describe the detection of two γca homologs, acca <dig> and acca <dig>  in both forms of acanthamoeba ci. acanthamoeba is a member of the eukaryotic supergroup amoebozoa and is not a close relative of plants  <cit> ; rather, available evidence indicates that amoebozoa comprises the evolutionary sister group to the opisthokonts . the unexpected finding of γca homologs in mitochondrial ci of acanthamoeba demonstrates that these proteins are not limited to ci of plants/green algae, as was previously suggested  <cit> . in fact, we provide evidence here that γca homologs having predicted mitochondrial targeting peptides  are widespread throughout the domain eucarya.

RESULTS
γ carbonic anhydrase proteins in acanthamoeba ci
an in-gel assay for nadh dehydrogenase activity was performed on acanthamoeba mitochondrial protein complexes separated by bn-page, yielding an insoluble formazan precipitate at ~ <dig> kda . this molecular weight estimate is in agreement with the findings of navet et al.  <cit>  and corresponds to the general size of ci across eukaryotes. together, these observations suggest that the identified nadh dehydrogenase activity corresponds to the native, enzymatically active ci of acanthamoeba. furthermore, analysis of acanthamoeba mitochondrial protein complexes by two-dimensional bn/sds-page revealed another, more abundant complex  of ~ <dig> kda that has a very similar protein profile to intact ci . based on the two-dimensional bn/sds-page profile and lack of enzyme activity following one-dimensional bn-page, we infer that this complex is likely a partially dissociated ci missing a portion of the nadh-oxidizing mitochondrial matrix domain. the dissociation of ci into subcomplexes during bn-page is not uncommon, and the observed breakdown into a slightly smaller, enzymatically inactive subcomplex is reminiscent of the situation in the green alga polytomella  <cit> .

tandem mass spectrometric analysis of the 940-kda and 820-kda bands demonstrated that both were enriched in ci subunits known from other organisms, supporting our conclusion that both represent ci . a number of contaminating, high-abundance mitochondrial proteins from other complexes were also present; this is not unexpected, as the relative abundance of ci is low in comparison with other complexes, and ci* appears to co-migrate with other abundant complexes . notably, two γca homologs were detected in both the 940-kda and 820-kda samples. these proteins, here named acca <dig> and acca <dig>  are 36% identical to each other and are the only γca homologs represented in the acanthamoeba tbestdb est library  <cit>  and the ongoing acanthamoeba nuclear genome project . between the two samples analyzed by ms/ms, 31% and 47% of the acca <dig> and acca <dig> protein sequences were covered, respectively . these findings constitute the first report of γca homologs as ci components outside of the plant/green algal lineage . based on these results, we suggest that acca <dig> and acca <dig> are matrix-facing components of the inner membrane arm of ci in acanthamoeba, as are their homologs in plants/green algae  <cit> .

because not all expected ci subunits were detected in the ms/ms analysis and because the main contaminants of our ci proteins were atp synthase proteins, we considered the possibility that the γca proteins might actually be atp synthase  subunits. the enzymatically active ci complex is present in very low abundance in a. castellanii, so that detection of all ci subunits is proving to be a challenge. conversely, cv is extraordinarily abundant, as is evident in figures 1a and 1b; as a result, ms/ms data have revealed all cv subunits in a. castellanii, whereas no γca proteins were detected in this complex. these considerations combined with the fact that γca proteins have been characterized as bona fide ci components in other organisms effectively eliminates the possibility that they might be cv subunits instead in acanthamoeba.

a small number of γca homologs have been described in eukaryotes outside of the plant supergroup. a cdna encoding a γca homolog from the haptophyte alga emiliania huxleyi was identified previously  <cit> ; however the authors did not investigate the subcellular localization of the protein. we have previously identified three different γca homologs in a proteomic investigation of highly purified mitochondria from the cilated protozoon, tetrahymena thermophila  <cit> . interestingly, two of these three γca homologs were detected in mass spectrometric analyses of a  <dig> mda aggregate from tetrahymena mitochondrial membrane proteins separated by bn-page . this aggregate is highly enriched in known protein components of complexes i, iii and v, suggesting that the identified γca homologs may be components of ci in tetrahymena as well.

from an evolutionary perspective, our findings are somewhat surprising: the amoebozoa supergroup  is thought to be sister to the opisthokonts , and is not closely related to the plantae supergroup  <cit> . since no authentic γca homologs were detected in opisthokont nuclear genome or est sequence databases , these results suggest that γca proteins may have been specifically lost from opisthokont ci, rather than recently added to the plant/green algal lineage. moreover, the finding that γca homologs may be components of ci in other eukaryotic groups  raises the possibility that γca homologs were an ancestral feature of mitochondrial ci . we expected that if this were the case, γca homologs should be detected in other protist lineages.

γ carbonic anhydrase proteins are found throughout eucarya
in order to better understand the distribution and evolution of γca homologs across the domain eucarya, we employed a systematic bioinformatics approach to search nuclear genomic and est sequence databases from diverse eukaryotes. in contrast to previous reports that γca proteins are largely limited to plants/green algae, we detected  homologs in the majority of eukaryotic groups . γca homologs are found in other major groups within the plantae supergroup, including one in the red alga cyanidioschyzon merolae and at least two in the glaucophyte alga, cyanophora paradoxa. aside from the opisthokonts, homologs could be detected in most eukaryotic supergroups, including amoebozoa , chromalveolata , excavata  and possibly rhizaria .

organisms are arranged according to supergroup membership  <cit> . 'number of γca homologs' refers to the number of distinct γca proteins encoded by an organism as determined by searches of est or nuclear genomic databases. inferred protein sequences are available in additional files  <dig> and 4

of the retrieved γca protein sequences considered to be complete at their n-termini , many are predicted to be mitochondrial by the programs targetp  <cit>  and mitoprotii  <cit>  above a confidence level of 70%, suggesting that γca proteins may be targeted to mitochondria in a wide variety of eukaryotes . notably, several of the known mitochondrial γca proteins are not predicted to have mtps with a given program , so the lack of an apparent mtp does not preclude a mitochondrial localization. genes encoding γca proteins are absent from the nuclear genome sequences of several eukaryotes that do not have conventional mitochondria  and are also absent from at least one eukaryote  that specifically lacks ci, further suggesting that γca proteins may be targeted to mitochondria - and likely to ci - in most eukaryotes. surprisingly, a γca homolog was detected in the nuclear genome of entamoeba histolytica  <cit> , an amoebozoon that does not possess conventional mitochondria . this homolog, however, does not appear to be closely related to other eukaryotic γcas, and may represent a lateral gene transfer from bacteria .

to assess evolutionary relationships, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of eukaryotic and bacterial γca proteins, using the archaeal cam sequence as outgroup. in the resulting phylogenetic trees , virtually all eukaryotic γca proteins formed a large clade branching as a sister group to α-proteobacteria . however, these trees were poorly resolved, with very little statistical  support for most partitions, so the phylogenetic conclusions that can be drawn from them are limited. although the available data  suggest an early γca gene duplication during eukaryotic evolution, phylogenetic analysis was not able to delineate the point at which this may have occurred. we can infer, however, that the duplication predated the divergence of the amoebozoan taxa investigated here; moreover, we are able to identify the amoebozoan sequences that are orthologous with either acca <dig> or acca <dig> .

analysis of primary protein structure of γca homologs
as earlier noted, plant and green algal γca proteins constitute a ci domain that is associated with the matrix face of the inner membrane-integrated arm  <cit> . arabidopsis encodes five γca homologs , all of which interact with ci  <cit> , while chlamydomonas ci contains three different γca homologs  <cit> . although arabidopsis γca1- <dig>  have retained nearly all residues known to be structurally or functionally important in the archetypal γca  from the methanogenic archaeon methanosarcina thermophila  <cit> , including the zn2+- binding residues h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig>  <cit> , the function of γca homologs in plant mitochondria is still largely unknown. plant γca proteins lack two glu residues  critical to the proton transfer mechanism of cam and all previous attempts to demonstrate carbonic anhydrase activity in arabidopsis mitochondrial extracts and in sucrose gradient-enriched plant ci  <cit>  and recombinant γca <dig> homotrimers  <cit>  have been unsuccessful. like the plant homologs, acanthamoeba γcas lack d <dig> and d84; moreover, acanthamoeba γcas conserve fewer of the other residues critical to cam function than do plant γcas. in terms of zn2+-binding his residues, acca <dig> conserves only h <dig> whereas acca <dig> retains h <dig> and h <dig> . however, it should be noted that the three his residues required to bind zn2+ in cam are not localized within the same γca monomer: rather, zn2+ is coordinated by h <dig> and h <dig> of one monomer and h <dig> of a second monomer within the trimeric cam structure  <cit> . it is noteworthy that the three his residues are distributed between the two γca homologs found in acanthamoeba, so it may be that the latter are able to bind zn2+ in concert. however, in acca <dig>  s and g replace n <dig> and q <dig>  respectively; in cam, n <dig> and q <dig> are proposed to be critical components of the catalytic mechanism  <cit> . taken together, these findings suggest that the γca homologs of acanthamoeba ci may not possess a carbonic anhydrase activity. on the other hand, carbonic anhydrase activity has been reported for a comparably divergent, recombinant γca from the haptophyte emiliania huxleyi  <cit> .

as is the case with the acanthamoeba proteins, the vast majority of γca proteins from eukaryotes outside of the plant supergroup do not individually conserve all three metal-binding his residues, although all three are often found among different γcas where multiple isoforms are present. thus, it is still unclear whether carbonic anhydrase activity or zn2+ binding is likely to be a general feature of γcas across eukaryotes. interestingly, several other positions in our phylogenetically broad multiple alignment are fairly well conserved across eukaryotes , but not in cam; it is possible that the conservation of these residues points to novel, potentially important functional sites. for instance, a his residue  is present in  <dig> of the  <dig> eukaryotic homologs with complete n-terminal sequence that we identified in this study, but not in bacterial/archaeal γca homologs, while a cys residue  is highly conserved in eukaryotes and bacteria , but not in cam . additionally, many of the eukaryotic γca homologs  have c-terminal extensions relative to their prokaryotic homologs. in land plants, these extensions have been implicated in integration into the inner mitochondrial membrane  <cit> , further supporting the idea that γca proteins may be components of ci in many diverse eukaryotes.

interestingly, inspection of the n-terminal portion of γcas from diverse eukaryotes demonstrates that there may be, in general, at least two distinct classes of γca proteins. in particular, the n-terminal ~ <dig> amino acids of acca <dig>  along with various protist γcas, are highly similar to the corresponding region of arabidopsis ca1- <dig>  whereas the n-termini of acca <dig> and arabidopsis cal1- <dig> are not highly conserved . this observation suggests that there may be distinct roles or sub-localizations of the two classes of γca within ci; specifically, the high degree of conservation of the n-terminal region of the acca2/ca1- <dig> class, but not acca1/cal1- <dig> class, implies that the functional constraints at protein n-termini are stronger in the former class.

possible function of γca proteins in ci
although in silico reconstructions of arabidopsis γca proteins and comparisons to cam suggest the possibility of carbonic anhydrase activity, the biochemical function of γca homologs in plant/green algal ci is controversial as there are currently no experimental data confirming that plant/green algal γca proteins are carbonic anhydrases. recently, however, it has been shown that arabidopsis γca <dig> trimers are capable of binding inorganic carbon  <cit> , and microarray studies indicate that expression of arabidopsis γca <dig> and γca <dig> is down-regulated under high co <dig> concentrations . these results suggest that γca homologs might play an important role in the metabolism or transport of one-carbon compounds in land plants. although these observations provide evidence that γcas function in relation to inorganic carbon metabolism in plants, it is still unclear whether these observations can be generalized across eukaryotes. as discussed above, most eukaryotes do not conserve all three his residues required for zn2+ coordination . consequently, it may be that the function of γca proteins is somewhat different in plants and other eukaryotes, and that ci γca proteins in non-plant species serve a predominantly structural role in the complex. ultimately, in order to distinguish between these possibilities, it will be important to determine whether or not non-plant γca proteins are capable of binding zn2+.

because ci γca proteins were believed to be plant-specific, it has been proposed that they are involved in plant-specific processes, namely hco3- formation , ultimately for co <dig> fixation in chloroplasts  <cit> . although we cannot rule out the possibility that ci γcas play an active role in chloroplast metabolism in plants, the presence of γca homologs in ci of ancestrally aplastidic eukaryotes  demonstrates that this could not have been the ancestral role of γcas in ci, and that these proteins must perform some role that is not related to chloroplast function. other data suggest that γca proteins in plants may play a role in expression and assembly of mitochondrial ci. for instance, it was demonstrated that total levels of ci, along with abundance of ci+ciii supercomplexes, are dramatically decreased  in arabidopsis γca <dig> and γca <dig> knockout lines grown in suspension culture  <cit> . a reduction in total ci protein was detected , suggesting that γca proteins play an important role in the expression/stability of ci subunits. recently, tripp et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the active site of cam contains fe2+ instead of zn2+ when the enzyme is reconstituted under anaerobic conditions. as noted by parisi et al.  <cit> , ci  contains multiple iron centers, so the fe-binding ability of cam may point to a role for γca proteins in mitochondrial respiratory control. notably, arabidopsis γca <dig>  a physical component of ci, has been annotated as a transcription factor involved in the anther-specific expression of nucleus-encoded ci proteins . the prospect that γca proteins may function as ci-specific transcription factors is quite intriguing, as it would suggest a novel mechanism of communication between the mitochondrial electron transport chain and the nucleus, and would indicate a function for ci γca proteins that could be applicable across all aerobic ci-containing eukaryotes, and not just photosynthetic ones.

CONCLUSIONS
the number of subunits comprising ci in eukaryotes has expanded markedly relative to the homologous bacterial complex. previous comparative genomic analyses have suggested that  <dig> proteins were added to ci very early in eukaryotic evolution, while a smaller proportion are specific to particular lineages within the eukaryotic domain  <cit> . although a number of the novel, 'lineage-specific' proteins are likely to be encoded by a phylogenetically restricted group of related organisms, others are currently deemed to be 'lineage-specific' only because our knowledge of ci composition across the eukaryotes is incomplete. we have detected two γca homologs - previously thought to be plant/green algal ci proteins - as components of ci in an amoeboid protozoon, acanthamoeba castellanii, an organism not specifically related to the plant/green algal lineage. the most parsimonious interpretation of our observations is that γca proteins were part of the eukaryotic core of ci that was added early in eukaryotic evolution, and that they were subsequently lost in certain groups, most notably the opisthokonts. moreover, γca proteins are known to be mitochondrial in ciliates  and bioinformatics searches have revealed a large repertoire of γca homologs in other major eukaryotic groups. these observations underscore the importance of characterizing the composition of mitochondrial protein complexes from a wide variety of organisms in order to understand fully and accurately their function and evolution.
