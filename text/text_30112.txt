BACKGROUND
transcription factors  bind to specific dna sequences and interact with components of the rna polymerase complex, or with other complexes, to regulate transcription in a cell type-specific manner, and this process is highly dependent on the chromatin structure in eukaryotes . the basic unit of chromatin structure is the nucleosome, consisting of histone octamers wrapped in  <dig> base pairs  of dna  <cit> . eukaryotic genomic dna is assembled into nucleosomes and is further packaged into chromatin to achieve high compaction. nucleosomes can directly regulate the accessibility of tfs and transcriptional machinery to the dna sequences  <cit> . sequences in nucleosome-depleted regions are easier to access, while the accessibility of dna within nucleosomes depends on nucleosome dynamics  <cit> . although histone-dna complexes are very stable, histones are constantly evicted and reassembled onto dna templates in a locus-specific manner. previous studies have suggested that promoters and other regulatory sequences are typically nucleosome-depleted, whereas transcribed regions tend to be occupied by well-positioned nucleosomes, which are maintained by nucleosome-remodeling activities  <cit> . the occupancy patterns and dynamic positioning of nucleosomes thus play crucial roles in regulating eukaryotic transcription.

nucleosomes influence the accessibility of tfs to dna. tfs can, in turn, directly or indirectly recruit remodeling complexes, or other coregulators, to modify the local chromatin state. the binding of several tfs, such as the insulator binding protein ctcf  <cit> , the re1-silencing transcription factor   <cit>  and the multifunctional tf yy <dig>  <cit> , has been suggested to initiate nucleosome depletion at tf binding sites  and the phased nucleosome arrays in the flanking regions in human cells. nearly  <dig>  tfs have been predicted computationally in the dna-binding domain  database  <cit> , and detailed manual curation has confirmed at least  <dig>  tfs in the human genome  <cit> . however, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing , a technique for measuring genome-wide tf binding profiles, is only applied to one tf in a single experiment, making it difficult to identify binding locations for large numbers of factors in the specific cell type. previous studies have, therefore, focused mainly on nucleosome occupancy around binding sites of a few specific tfs . computational methods have the advantage of being able to determine the accurate profiles for many factors in a specific sample  <cit> . like many computational methods, centipede  <cit> , based on a hierarchical bayesian mixture model, requires position weight matrices of known tf binding motifs; therefore, its ability is dependent on the availability of tf binding motifs. however, centipede incorporates cell-specific experimental data to infer binding sites in a particular cell type, making it more accurate for predicting tfbss.

to better understand the relationship between nucleosome positioning and tf binding, we focused on the centipede-inferred binding sites for  <dig> tf binding motifs, representing up to a third of the human tf repertoire, and examined the nucleosome occupancy around these binding sites in human gm <dig> and k <dig> cells. we further classified the binding sites by the distances of sites relative to the nearest gene and the functions of the bound tfs, to test whether the nucleosome occupancy exhibited distinct patterns. we finally clustered the nucleosome occupancy profiles around tfbss and investigated their relevance to gene expression.

RESULTS
nucleosome occupancy around tf binding sites
both in vitro and in vivo nucleosome occupancy data were used to examine the average nucleosome occupancy around the binding sites for  <dig> tf binding motifs  in gm <dig> and k <dig> cells. nucleosomes can be assembled by genomic dna and recombinant histones in the absence of cellular influences; therefore, in vitro nucleosome occupancy is affected mainly by the intrinsic specificity between a histone and the dna sequences, whereas in vivo occupancy is influenced by sequence preferences, tfs and chromatin remodelers  <cit> . analyses of in vivo data showed nucleosome-depleted regions at tfbss and an array of well-positioned nucleosomes in the flanking regions , which was consistent with the barrier model suggested in previous studies  <cit> . we then constructed in vitro nucleosome occupancy profiles, to test whether the in vivo nucleosome distributions were governed by the intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes. we observed high in vitro nucleosome occupancy at tfbss , suggesting that binding sequences of tfs tend to form nucleosomes. we further analyzed the nucleotide composition of tf binding sequences and found that these dna sequences were gc-rich . our analyses, which are consistent with previous studies  <cit> , demonstrated that human tfbss have high gc content and intrinsic nucleosome occupancy, but low in vivo nucleosome occupancy.figure  <dig>

low nucleosome signals in vivo are necessary for most tfbss, as tfs may compete with nucleosomes to slide or evict them for access to the specific dna  <cit> . it is generally believed that nucleosomes are depleted before tfs bind to their sites. however, a recent study argues that nucleosome eviction occurs after tf binding and, in fact, requires tf binding, suggesting that nucleosome loss may not be a prerequisite for tf binding  <cit> . the barrier model could explain the well-positioned nucleosomes around tfbss. binding of tfs can form barriers and other nucleosomes are stacked against them to generate the phased nucleosome arrays by atp-dependent chromatin remodelers  <cit> . despite dna sequences encoding nucleosome occupancy at certain regions, tf binding can drive nucleosomes to occupy intrinsically unfavorable dna sequences or evict nucleosomes from intrinsically favorable sites.

nucleosome occupancy around proximal and distal binding sites
tfbss may be located proximal or distal to the transcription start site . binding sites in the core or proximal promoter are typically located within one kilobase , while distal sites may be situated up to several hundred kb from the core promoter  <cit> . here, we defined proximal and distal sites as those located within 1 kb and beyond 10 kb from the nearest tss, respectively, and investigated the in vivo nucleosome occupancy around these sites. the nucleosome occupancy profiles around distal sites in both gm <dig> and k <dig> cells  were similar to those around all binding sites, as described in figure 1a. however, we observed lower in vivo nucleosome occupancy and fuzzier nucleosome positioning around proximal sites, which were more consistent with those around tsss . nucleosome-depleted regions are also essential for tsss, as rna polymerase and a variety of auxiliary components bind to dna and interact with each other around tsss  <cit> . in order to explain the in vivo nucleosome occupancy pattern around the proximal sites, we divided proximal sites into 100-bp intervals based on their distances relative to the nearest tss, and investigated the proportion of proximal sites in each interval. our results indicated that  <dig> % and  <dig> % of proximal sites in gm <dig> and k <dig> cells, respectively, were located within 200 bp relative to tsss , suggesting that many proximal sites are located within nucleosome-depleted regions near tsss, and nucleosome occupancy around proximal sites thus mostly reflect that around tsss. proximal sites fall within promoter regions near tsss, where nucleosomes are generally depleted, and therefore the average nucleosome occupancy is lower at proximal sites and the nucleosome positioning around proximal sites is less pronounced. on the other hand, distal sites are far from promoters, where the nucleosome occupancy is higher, the binding of tfs in the distal regions is therefore more likely to recruit atp-dependent chromatin remodelers to generate the phased nucleosome arrays.figure  <dig>

nucleosome occupancy around activator and repressor binding sites
activators and repressors positively and negatively regulate transcription, respectively. both activators, such as abf <dig>  <cit>  and reb <dig>  <cit>  in yeast, and repressors, such as the rest protein  <cit>  in human, have been suggested to bind to dna sequences that intrinsically encode high nucleosome occupancy, and their binding will influence the nucleosome organization. in yeast, it has also been suggested that activator binding sites show significantly higher correlation with nucleosome sequence profiles compared with those of repressors  <cit> . here, we queried the uniprot database to determine the functions of tfs  <cit> , and investigated the nucleosome occupancy around activator and repressor binding sites to test whether the functions of bound tfs influenced the nucleosome occupancy distribution in human cells. activators and repressors identified in gm <dig> and k <dig> cells were listed in additional file  <dig>  we first examined the in vivo nucleosome occupancy around activator and repressor binding sites. although nucleosome-depleted regions were observed at activator and repressor binding sites, nucleosomes around the repressors sites were better positioned compared with the activator sites in both gm <dig> and k <dig> cells . repressor binding sites are generally situated quite distally from tsss, while multiple binding sites for activators are located in the promoter  <cit> .  <dig> % of repressor sites and  <dig> % of activators sites were located beyond 10 kb from tss in the gm <dig> cell line, while in the k <dig> cell line, the percentages of distal repressor and activator sites were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. therefore, we examined the in vivo nucleosome occupancy around the distal activator and repressor sites  to avoid the influences of the transcriptional machinery near tsss. better-positioned nucleosomes were observed around the distal repressor sites , indicating that repressor binding induced the nucleosome distribution. we further investigated the in vivo nucleosome occupancy around the distal sites for each of activators and repressors. both activators, such as fli <dig> and nfe <dig>  and repressors, such as rest and tel- <dig>  can generate the phased nucleosome array . however, the nucleosome positioning around rest binding sites was particularly obvious, which contributed largely to the better nucleosome positioning around repressor sites. it should be noted that for some repressors, such as bcl6b_ <dig>  fuzzy nucleosome positioning was observed around their binding sites, suggesting that the formation of phased nucleosome array is associated with the specific tfs. we finally examined the in vitro nucleosome occupancy around activator and repressor binding sites. both activator and repressor sites were enriched in nucleosome sequence preferences . however, unlike yeast, repressor binding sequences were more likely to intrinsically encode nucleosomes in the human genome, according to the analysis of the in vitro data . the same conclusion was obtained from the analyses of distal sites. repressor binding to sequences with higher in vitro nucleosome occupancy might have more elevated dependence on nucleosome dynamics and chromatin remodeling complexes  <cit> , and this might contribute to the better-positioned nucleosomes flanking the repressor sites in vivo.figure  <dig>

nucleosome occupancy around dnase i-hypersensitive and -resistant sites
tfs compete with nucleosomes to access dna and nucleosome depletion is thus generally observed at their binding sites. however, tfs can bind to dna sequences with high in vivo nucleosome occupancy  <cit> . dnase i preferentially digests dna in regions of low nucleosome occupancy and dnase i-hypersensitive regions reflect the accessibility of genome. we found that  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the binding sites in gm <dig> and k <dig> cells, respectively, were not in dnase i-hypersensitive regions, and observed higher in vivo nucleosome occupancy at these dnase i-resistant binding sites, especially in the k <dig> cell line . we then investigated the in vitro nucleosome occupancy around the dnase i-hypersensitive and -resistant sites. similar in vitro nucleosome occupancy levels were observed around the dnase i-hypersensitive sites in gm <dig> and k <dig> cells. however, for dnase i-resistant binding sites, in vitro nucleosome occupancy level in the k <dig> cell line was higher than that in the gm <dig> cell line . the same conclusions were obtained by analyzing the distal dnase i-hypersensitive and -resistant sites . dna sequences around dnase i-resistant sites in the k <dig> cell line were more likely to form nucleosomes, and tf binding in the dnase i-resistant regions had less effect on the local chromatin structure, which might contribute to the higher in vivo nucleosome occupancy around dnase i-resistant sites in the k <dig> cell line. ctcf, serum response factor srf and c-rel were three tfs that most frequently bound to dnase i-resistant regions in gm <dig> cells, whereas the three tfs that most frequently bound to these regions were ctcf, srf and hnf <dig> in k <dig> cells. ctcf is a multifunctional tf, while srf and c-rel are considered as activators. it was also interesting to note that most of the dnase i-resistant binding sites were cell-type specific.  <dig> % and  <dig> % of these sites in gm <dig> and k <dig> cells, respectively, were cell-type specific and were not bound by any tf in the other type of cells. these results suggested that the dnase i-resistant sites might play important roles in the specific cells.figure  <dig>

clustering nucleosome occupancy around tf binding sites
some tfs can bind to the dnase i-resistant regions with high in vivo nucleosome occupancy and might regulate gene expression in a cell-type-specific way. a traditional profile that averages over all tf binding sites will neglect these specific nucleosome occupancy patterns. therefore we applied an unsupervised clustering method called clustered aggregation tool   <cit> , to discover the diverse in vivo nucleosome occupancy patterns around tfbss. the cluster analysis of all tfbss indicated that only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of tfbss in gm <dig> and k <dig> cells, respectively, were flanked by well-positioned nucleosomes on both sides . the cluster analysis of proximal and distal binding sites further indicated that tfbss exhibiting symmetric positioning of nucleosomes were mainly located in the distal regions . we clustered the nucleosome signals around distal activator and repressor binding sites and found that higher proportions of distal repressors sites showed strong nucleosome positioning on both sides . all these results were consistent with our previous analyses. however, the asymmetric nucleosome occupancy patterns were neglected in our previous analyses. the cluster analysis of nucleosome signals around tfbss indicated that the majority of tfbss showed strong nucleosome positioning on one side, suggesting that asymmetric patterns of nucleosome occupancy were more pervasive around tfbss.figure  <dig>

nucleosome occupancy patterns correlate with gene expression
it has been suggested that nucleosome occupancy patterns around tsss are associated with gene expression  <cit> . here we assigned each of the binding sites to the nearest gene based on its distance to tsss  <cit> , and investigated the correlations between in vivo nucleosome occupancy patterns around tfbss and gene expression. first, we grouped the nucleosome occupancy signals of all tfbss into three clusters using the cagt software, and examined the expression levels of unique target genes for each of the clusters in both gm <dig> and k <dig> cells . increasing the number of clusters would lead to a decrease in the number of target genes for each cluster, and we empirically grouped into three clusters. tfbss in the first cluster in both gm <dig> and k <dig> cells showed fuzzy nucleosome positioning and relatively higher nucleosome occupancy on one side ; tfbss in the second cluster had strongly positioned nucleosomes on both sides ; and tfbss in the third cluster were occupied by nucleosomes . analysis of gene expression levels for each of the clusters in both gm <dig> and k <dig> cells indicated that tfbss in the first cluster were associated with genes that were in general significantly more highly expressed .figure  <dig>

activators and repressors have the opposite effects on gene expression, but the binding of both of them can generate similar patterns of nucleosome occupancy . in order to clearly demonstrate the correlations between tf binding and gene expression, we further clustered the nucleosome occupancy signals around activator and repressor binding sites using the cagt software, and examined their relevance to gene expression in both gm <dig> and k <dig> cells. nucleosome signals around proximal activator binding sites in both gm <dig> and k <dig> cells were first grouped into three clusters using the cagt software . pattern  <dig>  in both gm <dig> and k <dig> cells showed fuzzy nucleosome positioning and higher nucleosome occupancy on one side of tfbss; pattern  <dig>  in gm <dig> and pattern  <dig>  in k <dig> showed high nucleosome occupancy at tfbss; pattern  <dig>  in gm <dig> and pattern  <dig>  in k <dig> exhibited one well-positioned nucleosome on one side of tfbss. the analysis of target gene expression for each cluster of proximal activator sites indicated that genes associated with proximal activator sites in pattern  <dig> had significantly lower expression in the gm <dig> cell line , and genes associated with sites in pattern  <dig> had significantly lower expression in the k <dig> cell line . the same analysis for the proximal repressor binding sites indicated that genes associated with proximal repressor sites in pattern  <dig>  had significantly lower expression in the gm <dig> cell line . pattern  <dig> in gm <dig> showed well-positioned nucleosomes on both sides of proximal repressor sites . we observed no significant differences in the expression levels of target genes for different clusters of proximal repressor sites in the k <dig> cell line . we also performed the same analyses on the distal activator and repressor binding sites in both gm <dig> and k <dig> cells, and found no significant differences in the expression levels of target genes for different clusters of distal activator and repressor sites . this might result from the assignment of target genes. we simply assigned target genes using the nearest distance, and it would be unreliable for the binding sites distal to tsss.figure  <dig>

discussion
transcription is regulated by the dynamic binding of tfs to the underlying dna sequences in a cell type-specific manner  <cit> . most eukaryotic genomic dna is packaged into nucleosomes, and tf binding is thus strongly associated with the local chromatin structure surrounding tfbss  <cit> . chromatin can affect the recognition and binding of tfs; tfs can, in turn, direct the chromatin remodeling complexes to their target regions  <cit> . we examined the nucleosome occupancy profiles around tfbss to better understand the intricate relationships between tf binding and chromatin structure, and we also investigated the correlations between binding sites with different patterns of nucleosome occupancy and gene expression.

although previous studies have demonstrated the nucleosome occupancy profiles around the binding sites for several specific tfs, our findings expand the current knowledge of nucleosome occupancy at tfbss, based on the greater number of tfs. first, tf binding regions are generally nucleosome-depleted as a result of tf and nucleosome interactions. tfs can directly compete with nucleosomes and evict them from the dna, while some tfs are aided by pioneer factors to bind to dna . pioneer factors, such as foxa, gata, and pu. <dig>  can bind to nucleosomal dna and displace nucleosomes to help other tfs access their sites  <cit> . although nucleosome-depleted regions are necessary for most tfbss, some tfs may bind to nucleosomal dna without nucleosome reorganization. previous studies have suggested that tf nf-κb p <dig> can bind to nucleosomal dna without perturbing the overall structure of the nucleosome  <cit> . we found that many tfbss were located within dnase-i resistant regions, and these dnase-i resistant sites were cell-type specific. the cluster analysis using the cagt software also indicated that a small proportion of tfbss were indeed occupied by nucleosomes. it should be also noted that tfs might directly bind to sites in the nucleosome-depleted regions, especially in the proximal promoter near tsss. second, better-positioned nucleosomes were observed around the repressor sites compared with those around the activator sites. repressors were more likely to bind to nucleosomal dna, which might require catalyzed remodeling, in the human genome. the higher dependence on chromatin remodeling complexes might contribute to the stronger nucleosome positioning around the repressor sites. besides, repressors are more associated with closed chromatin compared with activators. the highly positioned nucleosomes might result from the recruitment of different chromatin remodelers. third, although a quarter of tfbss showed arrays of well-positioned nucleosomes on both sides, the majority of tfbss exhibited one or more well-positioned nucleosomes on one side, and a small proportion of tfbss were occupied by nucleosomes in vivo. correlating these different patterns of nucleosome occupancy with the expression levels of target genes indicated that genes with tfbss exhibiting well-positioned nucleosomes on both sides or occupied by nucleosomes, had significantly lower expression levels. the analysis of gene expression for proximal activator and repressor binding sites further indicated that genes with repressor sites exhibiting well-positioned nucleosomes on both sides, and genes with activator sites occupied by nucleosomes had significantly lower expression, suggesting that actions of activators and repressors are associated with the nucleosome occupancy around their binding sites.

CONCLUSIONS
the dna sequence, tf binding and chromatin remodeling events are important determinants of in vivo nucleosome organization in human cells. in this study, we systematically investigated the nucleosome occupancy profiles around tfbss and their relevance to gene expression in human gm <dig> and k <dig> cells. the nucleosomes were generally depleted at tfbss in vivo, and asymmetric patterns of nucleosome occupancy were more pervasive around tfbss. however, approximately a quarter of tfbss showed well-positioned nucleosomes on both sides, and a small proportion of tfbss were occupied by nucleosomes. compared with the distal sites, proximal sites showed fuzzier nucleosome positioning. these proximal sites were located within 1 kb of tsss, and rna polymerase complexes near the tsss had a large effect on the nucleosome occupancy distributions around these sites. compared with activator sites, nucleosomes around repressor sites were better positioned. in addition, nucleosome occupancy patterns around tfbss were correlated with the expression levels of target genes. genes with repressor sites exhibiting well-positioned nucleosomes on both sides, and genes with activator sites occupied by nucleosomes had significantly lower expression.
