BACKGROUND
the entomopathogenic nematode, heterorhabditis bacteriophora, and its mutualistic bacterium, photorhabdus luminescens, are important biological control agents of insect pests  <cit>  and represent an emerging model for research on mutualistic and parasitic symbiosis  <cit> . the use of h. bacteriophora as a biological control agent is hampered by its susceptibility to environmental extremes including temperature, desiccation, and uv radiation, differences in virulence towards different insect pests, and short shelf life. elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying these biological processes may serve as a foundation for improving the biological control potential of the nematode-bacterium complex.

the entomopathogenic nematode h. bacteriophora has a distinct life style. the infective juveniles  or dauer juveniles  persist in soil in search of a suitable insect host  <cit> . following entry into the insect host through natural body openings and cuticle, the ijs regurgitate the symbiotic bacteria into the insect hemocoel  <cit> . the bacteria kill the insect host via septicemia, usually within 24– <dig> h  <cit> . the nematodes feed on the multiplying bacteria and disintegrated host tissues and produce  <dig> to  <dig> generations within the cadaver. when the food source depletes and nematode density reaches a threshold, next-generation ijs are formed which exit the cadaver in search of a new host  <cit> .

in contrast to the closely related genetic model caenorhabditis elegans, few genomic resources are available for h. bacteriophora. however, some progress has been made over the past few years with the generation and analysis of ~ <dig>  ests from h. bacteriophora gps <dig> strain  <cit> , the start of an h. bacteriophora complete genome sequence project , and the development of a reverse genetics tool using rna interference  <cit> . release of the genomes of c. elegans  <cit> , c. briggsae  <cit> , brugia malayi  <cit> , bacterium photorhabdus luminescens subsp. laumondii tto <dig>   <cit>  and over  <dig> million ests from various nematode species deposited in genbank offers unprecedented opportunities for the genetics of entomopathogenic nematodes. here, we report on the construction of cdna libraries from h. bacteriophora tto <dig> adult hermaphrodites and the generation and analysis of  <dig>  ests. the tto <dig> strain is different from gps <dig> strain in insect toxicity and their symbiotic bacteria . ests are valuable for gene discovery and can also be used in the identification of microsatellite markers  <cit> . therefore, we also identified microsatellite loci in h. bacteriophora ests for use in population genetic studies. in addition, ests will also aid the prediction of protein-coding genes in the annotation of complete genomes. however, domain identification, secretome prediction, phylogenetic and evolution analysis on the ests that are of short-length and low coverage are not very informative, and therefore were not performed.

RESULTS
generation of ests and assembly
a total of  <dig>  ests from adult h. bacteriophora tto1-m13e strain were generated from cdna libraries and were deposited in genbank under the accession numbers  – ,  – ,  – ,  – ,  – , and  – . the removal of vector and short length  sequences resulted in  <dig>  high-quality ests with an average length of  <dig> bp. the cumulative length of all high-quality est sequences was  <dig> , <dig> bases.

the ests were subjected to cluster analysis using vector nti advance™  <dig> , with the final assembly generated by vector nti advance™  <dig>  the final assembly contained  <dig>  contigs generated from  <dig>  ests and  <dig>  singletons . the contigs consisted of  <dig> to  <dig> ests  with lengths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp and a mean of  <dig> bp . the average length of singletons was  <dig> bp . in total, we identified  <dig>  distinct est sequences.

putative functional identifications of the ests
in order to assess the putative identities, all distinct ests were subjected to blastx sequence similarity searches against genbank's nr database and wormpep <dig> database consisting of extensively curated c. elegans proteins from wormbase  <cit> . of the  <dig>  distinct ests,  <dig>   had significant matches  to proteins in genbank's nr database. as expected, most of the best matches  were to nematode proteins . a small proportion  of the best matches was to prokaryotic proteins with localized sequence similarity ranging from 28% to 98% and a median of 81%  and the remaining  <dig> % of the best matches was to other eukaryotes including humans, fungi, plants, and insects. of the remaining  <dig>  h. bacteriophora distinct ests,  <dig> had significant matches to nucleotide sequences in genbank nt database, including  <dig> that matched to mitochondrial genes.

a. "identities" was presented as "length of aligned h. bacteriophora est"/"full length of h. bacteriophora est", percentage of identities over the aligned sequences.

the similarity search against c. elegans-specific database wormpep <dig> returned essentially similar results . of the  <dig>  h. bacteriophora distinct ests,  <dig>   had significant matches  to  <dig>  c. elegans proteins in wormpep <dig> database. based on sequence similarity results,  <dig> h. bacteriophora ests were identified to be involved in rna interference  pathway . the currently identified h. bacteriophora rnai genes are a small portion of those identified in c. elegans and b. malayi . we also identified  <dig> ests corresponding to  <dig> genes potentially involved in dauer-related processes  and  <dig> ests corresponding to  <dig> genes involved in defense and stress responses .

a. "similarity" was presented as "length of aligned h. bacteriophora est"/"full length of h. bacteriophora est", percentage of positives over the aligned sequences.

a. the alignment is presented in the following format: /h. bacteriophora length; /c. elegans length.

identification of parasitic nematode-specific ests
in order to identify parasitic nematode-specific ests, a comparison of h. bacteriophora ests to all nematode est sequences from genbank  was performed. the nematode taxa having ests were divided into animal- and human-parasitic nematodes , plant-parasitic nematodes , and free-living nematodes  to enable a more informative comparison using tblastx algorithm with an e value cutoff of 1e- <dig> . of the  <dig>  h. bacteriophora ests,  <dig>  had no matches to nematode ests  of which  <dig>  had no matches to proteins but  <dig> had matches to proteins of other organisms. there were  <dig> h. bacteriophora ests matching to ests of flns only, which encoded proteins potentially involved in processes shared by flns and entomopathogenic nematodes, such as dauer formation and response to environmental stresses. there were  <dig> h. bacteriophora ests matching only to ests of ahpns,  <dig> matching only to ests of ppns, and  <dig> matching only to ests of ahpns and ppns. therefore, there were collectively  <dig> h. bacteriophora ests not matching to any of the ests of flns. when these  <dig> h. bacteriophora ests were searched against genbank's nr database using blastx algorithm we found that  <dig> had no matches to proteins of flns. these  <dig> h. bacteriophora ests were designated as parasitic nematode-specific ests and listed in the additional file 4: summary of blastx identification of parasitic nematode-specific h. bacteriophora ests. among these  <dig> ests,  <dig>  matched to ests from clade v parasitic nematodes and the remaining  <dig> ests  matched to ests from parasitic nematodes in other clades. among these parasitic nematode-specific ests,  <dig> had matches to proteins of other organisms, enabling putative function assignment. among these ests are those encoding f-box-like/wd-repeat protein, theromacin, bax inhibitor-1-like protein, and paz domain containing protein, which represent interesting targets for in-depth functional analysis. the remaining  <dig> had no matches to any protein in the current databases, and are thus considered novel sequences.

gene ontology annotation
gene ontology  terms were assigned to  <dig>  distinct ests with blastx search against the april  <dig> release of go database . the go assignment included  <dig>  biological process terms assigned  <dig>  times to  <dig>  distinct ests,  <dig> cellular component terms assigned  <dig>  times to  <dig>  distinct ests, and  <dig> molecular function terms assigned  <dig>  times to  <dig>  distinct ests. "embryonic development ending in birth or egg hatching"  was the most dominant term out of the  <dig>  distinct ests assigned to biological process go category, followed by "nematode larval development" , "positive regulation of growth rate" , "reproduction" , and "growth" . biological process term associations of h. bacteriophora distinct ests that may present potential interests included:   <dig> with "determination of adult life span";   <dig> with "defense response";   <dig> with dauer-related biological processes, including "dauer larval development", "dauer entry", and "dauer exit"; and   <dig> with stress-related biological processes. protein binding  was the most dominant term among the  <dig>  h. bacteriophora ests annotated to the molecular function category, followed by identical protein binding  and cytochrome-c oxidase activity . among the  <dig>  h. bacteriophora ests annotated to cellular component category,  <dig> were nuclear and  <dig> were in cytoplasm. the go assignment for each h. bacteriophora est is given in additional file 4: summary of go assignment of h. bacteriophora distinct ests.

microsatellite-containing ests
in total, we identified  <dig> microsatellite loci from  <dig> h. bacteriophora distinct est sequences. among these  <dig> h. bacteriophora ests,  <dig> had no matches to proteins in genbank's nr database. the identified microsatellites were di-nucleotide , tri-nucleotide , tetra-nucleotide , penta-nucleotide , and hexa-nucleotide  . among the  <dig> microsatellite loci,  <dig> had good flanking sequences for primer design while the remaining  <dig> had either short flanking sequences or the flanking sequences had too low gc contents for primer design . the primers designed for the  <dig> microsatellite loci are potentially useful for genetic linkage mapping and population genetic studies.

discussion
this work produced a total of  <dig>  high quality ests representing  <dig>  distinct sequences. sequence similarity searches of h. bacteriophora distinct ests showed  <dig> %  matches to proteins from genbank's nr database. the remaining  <dig> % h. bacteriophora distinct ests represented novel genes yet to be assigned a function, demonstrating enormous novel gene discovery potential of this est study. among h. bacteriophora distinct ests having matches to proteins of other organisms in genbank's nr database, a vast majority  matched nematode proteins. about 71%  h. bacteriophora distinct ests match to  <dig>  proteins from wormpep <dig> that contains  <dig>  extensively curated c. elegans proteins. h. bacteriophora homologs in c. elegans represent  <dig> % of proteins in c. elegans. this finding suggests that h. bacteriophora and c. elegans have vastly different in proteomes, which may be explained in part by free-living versus parasitic life styles.

interestingly,  <dig> distinct ests  matched to proteins from various prokaryotic organisms , all of which had less than 100% local sequence identities to prokaryotic sequences. these transcripts could result from horizontal gene transfer from bacteria encountered by h. bacteriophora during its life cycle. none of these ests matched to genes or proteins of p. luminescens subsp. laumondii tto <dig>  the natural symbiont of h. bacteriophora tto <dig>  <cit> . given the fact that poly rna was used in est sequencing and the prokaryotic sequences were less than 100% identical to known prokaryotes, the possibility that these sequences are contaminants from other bacteria is low, although the possibility cannot be ruled out completely. the identification of sequences of putative prokaryotic origin in h. bacteriophora ests are consistent with our previous observations  <cit>  and those observed in plant parasitic nematodes  <cit> . the putative prokaryotic origin of these sequences could be tested more rigorously once the complete genome sequence becomes available.

sequence similarity searches of h. bacteriophora distinct ests against ests of other nematodes and proteins revealed the presence of  <dig> parasitic nematode-specific ests . eighty-six percent of these ests matched ests from parasitic nematodes in clade v. taken into consideration the fact that most flns included in this study were also from clade v, we are confident that these ests reflect the differences between parasitic and free-living nematodes and are not the result of phylogenetic constraint. these  <dig> h. bacteriophora ests had sequence similarities with ests from other parasitic nematodes, suggesting that these genes may participate in parasitism-related activities. although the  <dig>  ests without matches to any nematode ests could be h. bacteriophora specific, we hesitate to consider them as parasitic nematode specific at this time because they lack sequence similarity to ests of parasitic nematodes. among these, the  <dig>  ests without matches to any proteins in the current genbank nr database represent potentially novel h. bacteriophora genes, and  <dig> of these were identified in the est dataset of h. bacteriophora gps <dig> strain  <cit> . these findings suggest the enormous potential of discovering new genes and gene functions, genetic networks, and metabolic pathways specific to h. bacteriophora and other entomopathogenic nematodes. the identification of h. bacteriophora ests shared with other parasitic nematodes through our est comparison opens the door for conducting in-depth research on gene functions that will ultimately elucidate the parasitic nematode-specific biological processes.

among the  <dig> parasitic nematode-specific ests are those encoding f-box-like/wd-repeat protein, theromacin, bax inhibitor-1-like protein, and paz domain containing protein. est ff <dig> encodes a homolog of the f-box-like/ed-repeat protein in brugia malayi  <cit> . the wd-repeat is commonly associated with f-box domain that mediates protein-protein interactions in a variety of contexts such as polyubiquitination  <cit> . est ff <dig> encodes a protein similar to the paz domain containing protein in brugia malayi  <cit> . the paz  domain has nucleic acid-binding capability and is potentially involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing  <cit> . further investigation is needed to elucidate the functions of these two ests with common domains and whether they are related to parasitic nematode-specific processes.

two other parasitic nematode-specific ests are contig <dig> and contig <dig>  contig <dig> encodes a homolog of theromacin in the segmented worm theromyzon tessulatum  <cit> . theromacin is a novel antimicrobial peptide acting against gram-positive bacteria but without any similarities to other known antimicrobial peptides  <cit> . h. bacteriophora tto <dig> is obligately symbiotic with photorhabdus luminescens subsp. laumondii tto <dig> in natural environments. the production of an antimicrobial peptide could help establish the symbiotic relationship by selectively eliminating competing microbes. it is also possible that the antimicrobial peptide is a defense mechanism against potentially harmful microbes in the environment. contig <dig> encodes a protein similar to the uncharacterized protein family upf <dig> containing protein in brugia malayi  and bax inhibitor-1-like protein in wasp nasonia vitripennis . bax inhibitor- <dig> is a member of bcl- <dig> family that suppresses programmed cell death  <cit> . transmembrane bax inhibitor motif protein  homologs have been identified in c. elegans, c. briggsae, c. japonica, c. remanei, and pristioncus pacifiucs . however, these genes have very low sequence similarities to h. bacteriophora contig <dig>  bax inhibitor- <dig> is involved in preventing endoplasmic reticulum stress-related programmed cell death in arabidopsis  <cit>  and humans  <cit> .

go assignments based on sequence similarity searches aid identification of h. bacteriophora distinct ests involved in different biological processes. here we discuss the genes involved in some biological processes of interest in detail. a number of ests related to defense responses and stress responses were identified in these h. bacteriophora distinct ests  based on go assignments. among h. bacteriophora distinct ests involved in defense response are  <dig> ests encoding a homolog of c. elegans smek  homolog that is essential for daf-16-mediated defense response to pathogenic bacteria and increased resistance to oxidative and uv-induced damage  <cit> . est es <dig> encodes a heat shock protein hsp16- <dig> that is induced solely in response to heat shock or other environmental stresses  <cit> . another  <dig> ests encoding  <dig> different proteins whose c. elegans homologs exhibit a "pathogen susceptibility increased" phenotype when silenced by rnai  <cit> . however, the molecular functions of these proteins have yet to be elucidated. the defense response transcripts may be involved in the protection of entomopathogenic nematode ijs from bacterial or fungal pathogens and the insect innate immune system.

five h. bacteriophora distinct ests involved in stress response encode a homolog to c. elegans catalase ctl- <dig> that likely is involved in protecting cells from reactive oxygen species as an antioxidant enzyme  <cit> . another est  encodes a protein whose c. elegans homolog showed an "organism stress response abnormal" phenotype when silenced with rnai  <cit> . functions of other ests involved in stress response are yet to be clearly characterized. these transcripts related to stress responses provide workable targets for the improvement of ultraviolet, desiccation, and heat stress tolerance, traits desperately sought for improving the biological pest control potential of h. bacteriophora. once the functions of these genes are determined, they can be potentially used for genetic manipulations of entomopathogenic nematodes. ests involved in dauer larval development, dauer entry, and dauer exit were also identified  according to go assignments. the infective juvenile stage of entomopathogenic nematodes is developmentally similar to the dauer stage in many bacteria feeding nematodes, including c. elegans and c. briggsae. the dauer is a developmentally arrested stage triggered by food deprivation, high population density, and other harsh environmental conditions  <cit> . elucidation of this process is of specific interest in the case of entomopathogenic nematodes because the dauer juvenile is the only life stage capable of infecting insects  <cit> .

rna interference represents a powerful technique for analysis of gene function. an rnai system relying on soaking in double-stranded rna solution has been established in h. bacteriophora  <cit> . interestingly, we were able to identify only a small number of known rnai related genes in h. bacteriophora  compared to c. elegans and b. malayi  <cit> .

we have identified genes encoding rnai induced silencing complex  components. one est  encodes a homolog of c. elegans tsn- <dig>  and another est  encodes a homolog of c. elegans vig- <dig> . tsn- <dig>  containing  <dig> staphylococcal/micrococcal nuclease domains and a tudor domain is a risc component in c. elegans, drosophila and mammals  <cit> . the purified tsn- <dig> from c. elegans was shown to have nuclease activity and therefore thought to contribute to rna degradation in rnai  <cit> . the product of the vig- <dig> gene was also shown to be a component of risc  <cit> . we did not identify a member of argonaute family in this est set based on sequence similarity. however, we identified an est  encoding a protein similar to a paz domain containing protein from brugia malayi . another est  encodes a putative homolog to drosophila and human drosha  <cit>  rather than dicer in c. elegans. these findings suggest that h. bacteriophora may have structurally different rnai pathway components than its relative, c. elegans.

other rnai related genes we were able to identify are those encoding homologs of smg- <dig>  smg- <dig>  rde- <dig>  gfl- <dig>  and zfp- <dig>  smg- <dig> and smg- <dig> are involved in nonsense-medicated mrna decay  where eukaryotic mrnas with premature stop codons are selectively and rapidly degraded  <cit> . the other three genes, rde- <dig>  <cit> , gfl- <dig> and zfp- <dig>  <cit>  were shown to be involved in rnai via rnai evidence. we currently are not able to identify a gene encoding a sid- <dig> homolog in h. bacteriophora tto <dig> that was shown to be necessary for systemic rnai  <cit> . however, a sid- <dig> gene has been found in h. bacteriophora gps <dig>  <cit> . it is possible that more known genes may be identified when the complete genome of h. bacteriophora tto <dig> is sequenced.

this est project also enabled the development of genetic markers. we have identified  <dig> microsatellite loci from h. bacteriophora distinct ests, of which we were able to design primers for  <dig> based on the flanking sequences. these microsatellite markers may be useful for genetic mapping, linkage analysis, and population genetic studies. in a separate effort, microsatellite loci with 2- or 3-bp repeat units were selected for microsatellite marker development, along with the microsatellite loci enriched from genomic dna of h. bacteriophora  <cit> . eight polymorphic microsatellite loci were demonstrated within a northeast ohio population.

CONCLUSIONS
we have generated  <dig>  high quality h. bacteriophora ests representing  <dig>  distinct sequences. among these,  <dig>   ests matched to proteins in genbank's nr database. the vast majority  of the best matches was to nematode proteins, a small portion  to prokaryotic proteins and the remaining  <dig> % to other eukaryotic proteins. go terms were assigned to  <dig>  h. bacteriophora distinct ests. "embryonic development ending in birth or egg hatching" and "protein binding" were the most dominant terms in the categories of biological process and molecular function, respectively. this est collection offers unprecedented opportunities for research on this unique nematode-bacterium symbiotic complex. the comparison of ests of h. bacteriophora tto <dig> with those of ahpns, flns, and ppns resulted in the identification of  <dig> parasitic nematode-specific ests. these ests should be valuable for future research related to insect parasitism by these nematodes. we were able to identify a small number of ests involved in rnai, among which is an est encoding a drosha homolog, suggesting structurally different rnai pathway components from those in c. elegans. in addition, we have identified  <dig> microsatellite loci which may prove valuable once their polymorphisms are tested and validated. overall, novel, parasitic nematode-specific, and c. elegans homologous genes have been identified in this est study, greatly facilitating genome annotation, gene functional analysis, population genetic studies, and microarray development.
