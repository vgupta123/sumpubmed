BACKGROUND
the genus jatropha of euphorbiaceae family contains about  <dig> known species  <cit>  of which jatropha curcas l. is the most promising and suitable species for biodiesel production worldwide. biodiesel is produced by transesterification of the oil to fatty acid methyl esters. being non-edible crop, use of jatropha oil for biodiesel production does not threaten food security. its cultivation in degraded soil can control erosion, and help in land reclamation. it is used for manufacturing soap, purgative agents, candles, coloring dyes and astringents  <cit> . medicinal properties of jatropha include anti-tumor, anti-microbial, anti-parasitic, and anti-diarrheal activities  <cit> .

the oil content of jatropha which is around 30% could be increased to about 50% in order to make it commercially viable. in terms of oil composition, decreasing the content of unsaturated fatty acids , free fatty acids , and 18-carbon fatty acids  would help to improve the quality of jatropha biodiesel. jatropha oil cake - the by product of oil extraction, is not used as animal feed due to the presence of toxic curcin and phorbol esters. since it is not economical to remove these compounds, it would be desirable to block their accumulation itself by seed-specific silencing of the relevant genes. this will add economic value to the crop. large scale cultivation of jatropha also requires the development of varieties that are tolerant to drought, and resistant to pests and diseases.

genetic engineering methods could play a major role in jatropha crop improvement, because the scope for classical breeding is limited due to longer breeding cycle. genetic manipulations in jatropha require genomic information and cloning of all the important genes. the genome size of j. curcas is estimated to be 410mb  <cit> . the jatropha genome has been fully sequenced by synthetic genomics inc, california, usa but it is not available for public use  <cit> . partial genomic sequence of  <dig> mb is available in public databases but it is not assembled and annotated  <cit> . natarajan et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  have reported  <dig>  ests using a normalized cdna library from developing seeds, and costa et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  have reported  <dig>  ests using non-normalized cdna libraries from developing and germinating endosperm. contig assembly of these ests showed the presence of  <dig>  unigenes . recently, sato et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  have reported  <dig>  pyrosequencing reads from leaf and callus transcriptome which were assembled in to  <dig>  contigs. hybrid assembly of the unigenes and the assembled transcripts revealed the presence of  <dig>  unique sequences . this is far below the number of sequences required to represent the whole transcriptome of jatropha. annotation of the currently available unique sequences showed that several important genes are yet to be cloned.

high throughput  <dig> pyrosequencing of uncloned cdnas is a powerful method for whole genome transcriptome analysis and gene discovery.  <dig> pyrosequencing using gs flx platform was done in many plants including arabidopsis  <cit> , artemisia  <cit> , cucumber  <cit> , medicago  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and barley  <cit> , and an average read length of 100- <dig> bases was obtained. shorter read length was a major problem in assembly, especially in case of de novo assembly of the data from novel organisms, which do not have previously assembled and annotated reference sequences  <cit> . this limitation has been quickly overcome by using the newly launched titanium platform of gs flx which increased the average read length to as high as  <dig> bases  <cit> . concurrent improvements in de novo assembly software made it possible to assemble large number of full-length transcripts from novel organisms using  <dig> pyrosequencing data. here, we report  <dig> pyrosequencing of normalized cdnas from roots, mature leaves, flowers, developing seeds, and mature embryo of j. curcas using gs flx titanium platform, and report de novo assembly of  <dig>  transcripts.

RESULTS
cdna synthesis and normalization
total rna was isolated from roots, mature leaves, flowers, developing seeds, and embryos of j. curcas. quality of the rna as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis  and od260/od <dig> ratio  was found to be suitable for cdna synthesis. the total rna from the five tissues were pooled and normalized cdna was synthesised. normalization of the cdna greatly reduces the frequency of abundant transcripts, and increases the rate recovery of unique transcripts  <cit> . the efficiency of normalization was monitored by doing a parallel normalization reaction using chloramphenicol resistance gene as reporter gene. redundant rate of the reporter gene was reduced from 1% to  <dig> % after normalization which indicated  <dig> fold reduction in abundance. the normalized cdna was subjected to quality control experiments before using it for  <dig> pyrosequencing. a test cdna library was constructed using an aliquote of the normalized cdna, and clones were randomly selected for further analysis. the average size of the normalized cdnas as determined by pcr was about  <dig>  kb  which is higher than average transcript size. sequencing and blastx analysis revealed that 90% of the clones were full-length at the 5' end. these results showed that the normalized cdna is highly suitable for  <dig> pyrosequencing.

 <dig> pyrosequencing using gs flx titanium platform
half-plate  <dig> pyrosequencing reaction of the normalized cdna was done using gs flx titanium platform. it produced  <dig>  mb data from  <dig>  reads with an average read length of  <dig> bases . first, the sequences were filtered using a minimum quality cut off value of  <dig>  then, the additional sequences that were added during cdna synthesis were trimmed off. poly  sequences were retained as they were reported to be useful in transcript assembly  <cit> . sequences with less than  <dig> bases were removed before assembly. finally,  <dig>  ready-to-assemble reads were obtained. size distribution of these reads is shown in figure  <dig>  length of these reads ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> bases with an average of  <dig> bases.

de novo assembly
reference assembly with the partial genomic sequence of jatropha  <cit>  showed mapping of  <dig> % of the reads, and the consensus accuracy was  <dig> %. the details of reference assembly are given in additional file  <dig>  however, it could not be used for transcript assembly because the genome is not assembled and annotated. therefore, de novo assembly was done using gs de novo assembler. this assembler can assemble the data under genomic or cdna option. the genomic option assembles overlapping reads and reports consensus sequences as contigs. the cdna option continues with linking the contigs together to form isotigs  and isogroups . since the objective of this study was only to assemble the transcripts, the genomic option was used. gs de novo assembler version  <dig> p <dig> was reported to be better than the version  <dig>  for de novo assembly using cdna option  <cit> . therefore, we have evaluated the currently available three versions of the assembler  using genomic option. contig assembly was done under the stringent assembly parameters of  <dig> bases overlap and 95% overlap identity. the results did not show significant differences among the versions in terms of the number of reads assembled into contigs, number of contigs assembled, average contig length, and the length of the longest contig . therefore, we have used the output from the latest version of the assembler  for further analysis.

the number of ests that are available from jatropha based on sanger sequencing is  <dig>   <cit> . from the first  <dig> pyrosequencing study in jatropha,  <dig>  reads with an average read length of  <dig> bases were reported by sato et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . analysis of these reads showed the presence of  <dig>  repeat reads , thereby, reducing the effective number of reads to  <dig> . we have obtained  <dig>  reads with an average read length of  <dig> bases, and there were only  <dig> repeat reads . this may be because we have used cdnas that were normalized against abundant transcripts. in addition, we have used a more diverse pool of cdnas from five different tissues. these two factors have also played a role in the number of contigs assembled and the contig length. contig assembly showed  <dig>  contigs with an average contig length of  <dig> bases, and  <dig>  contigs with an average contig length of  <dig> bases from the effective reads of sato et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  and the current study, respectively. the sequences of the assembled contigs are given in additional file  <dig> and  <dig>  the size distribution of the contigs obtained from the current study is shown in figure  <dig>  hybrid assembly of the existing ests  <cit>  and assembled contigs  <cit>  revealed the presence of  <dig>  unique ests from sanger sequencing, and  <dig>  unique transcripts from  <dig> pyrosequencing. similar analysis of the  <dig>  contigs that were assembled in the present study uncovered  <dig>  unique transcripts. together, at least partial sequences of  <dig>  expressed genes are currently known from jatropha.

annotation
similarity search for all the contigs was done against non-redundant protein sequences database  using blastx, and the  <dig>  contigs that showed significant similarity  were annotated. it was found that  <dig>  annotated contigs were full-length, and their size ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp. these sequence information could be used for direct amplification of the desired genes. the remaining  <dig>  contigs were partial at 3' end  or 5' end  or both ends . these sequence information will be useful in cloning full-length genes using methods like rapid amplification of cdna ends  pcr. however, these methods are cumbersome, and are not amenable for high throughput applications. therefore, it would be easier to increase the number of full-length transcripts by increasing the number of reads from  <dig> pyrosequencing.

pathway mapping of contigs by kegg
ortholog assignment and mapping of the contigs to the biological pathways were performed using kegg automatic annotation server . all the contigs were compared against the kegg database using blastx with threshold bit-score value of  <dig> . it assigned ec numbers for  <dig>  contigs, and they were mapped to respective pathways. the mapped contigs represented metabolic pathways of major biomolecules such as carbohydrates, lipids, nucleotides, amino acids, glycans, cofactors, vitamins, terpenoids, polyketides, etc. the kegg pathway analysis also showed that  <dig> and  <dig> contigs represent the major metabolic pathways and biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolites, respectively. the mapped contigs also represented the genes involved in genetic information processing , environmental information processing  and cellular processes .

genes involved in oil biosynthesis
jatropha is popularly grown for biodiesel production. however, making it an ideal biodiesel crop requires genetic manipulations for increased oil yield and modified oil composition using the genes that are involved in oil biosynthesis pathway. therefore, the contigs that were mapped to oil biosynthesis pathway were analyzed in detail. biosynthesis of oil  in plants takes place in three major steps,  biosynthesis of fatty acids in plastids,  activation and transport of fatty acids to endoplasmic reticulum and  synthesis of triacyl glycerol or oil. in arabidopsis,  <dig> enzymes and  <dig> proteins are involved in oil biosynthesis  <cit> . twenty-eight of these enzymes are encoded by single genes, and the remaining  <dig> enzymes and the  <dig> proteins are encoded by small gene families. in jatropha,  <dig> non-redundant sequences coding for  <dig> enzymes and  <dig> proteins that are involved in oil biosynthesis were already reported  <cit>  but all of them were partial sequences. from this study, full-length transcripts were obtained for  <dig> of these partial sequences and significantly longer transcripts were obtained for another  <dig> partial sequences . in addition,  <dig> full-length and  <dig> partial transcripts coding for  <dig> enzymes and  <dig> protein were also identified. in total,  <dig> sequences related to oil biosynthesis were found from this study, and  <dig> of them are reported for the first time in jatropha .

* contigs representing full length genes

biosynthesis of fatty acids
oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acety-coa by pyruvate dehydrogenase  is the first committing step in fatty acid biosynthesis. pdh is a four subunit enzyme complex having pyruvate decarboxylase , dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase  and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase  enzymes  <cit> . contigs representing all the four subunits were identified from the current study. fatty acid biosynthesis is initiated by the condensation of acetyl-coa to malonyl-coa which is catalyzed by heteromeric acetyl coa carboxylase . it consists of three nuclear encoded subunits  and a plastid encoded subunit   <cit> . accumulation of the mrnas for these four subunits is co-ordinately regulated so that a constant molar stoichiometric ratio is maintained  <cit> . however, the plastid encoded subunit seems to be crucial for the accumulation of heteromeric accase, and for increasing the oil content  <cit> . plants also have a homomeric accase localized in cytosol that does not play any major role in fatty acid biosynthesis that takes place almost exclusively in plastids. however, by targeting this enzyme to plastids, oil content was increased five-fold in potato tubers  <cit>  and 5% in rapeseed  <cit> . we have found full-length contigs for all the four subunits of heteromeric accase and a 5' partial contig  for homomeric accase.

condensation of malonyl-coa and acyl carrier protein  to form 3-carbon malonyl-acp is catalysed by malony coa acyl transferase. polymerization of the fatty acid carbon chains starts with the formation of a 4-carbon butyryl-acp by the addition of a carbon from acetyl-coa to the 3-carbon malonyl-acp by the action of keto acyl acp synthase iii . further chain elongation up to 16-cabon palmitoyl-acp is carried out by keto acyl acp synthase i  in six consecutive steps by adding two carbons in each step. finally, keto acyl acp synthase ii  converts the 16-cabon palmitoyl-acp to 18-carbon stearoyl-acp. while kasi is essential for seed oil content  <cit> , kasii is useful for manipulating the chain length of the fatty acids. longer the chain length of fatty acids more is the viscosity of the oil as well as the biodiesel derived from it  <cit> . viscosity affects atomization of the biodiesel and lowers the performance of the diesel engines due to engine deposits  <cit> . viscosity of jatropha oil can be lowered by reducing its 18-carbon fatty acid content which is reported to be as high as  <dig> %  <cit> . previous reports suggest that this can be achieved by silencing the activity of kasii that converts the palmitoyl-acp to stearoyl-acp  <cit> . alternatively, the activity of palmitoyl-acp thioesterase  could be enhanced to accelerate the cleavage of palmitic acid from the palmitoyl-acp before it is converted to stearoyl-acp  <cit> . the contigs for all these genes were found in the current study.

saturated fatty acids are desaturated to produce unsaturated fatty acids, and plant oils contain both of them in varying proportions. in plants, 18: <dig> stearoyl-acp is sequentially desaturated to 18: <dig> oleoyl-acp, 18: <dig> linoleoyl-acp and 18: <dig> linolenyl-acp by stearoyl acp desaturase , delta-12-fatty acid desaturase  and omega-3-fatty acid desaturase , respectively. increased degree of unsaturation affects oxidative stability and ignition quality of the biodiesel  <cit> . therefore, the high content of unsaturated fatty acids  in jatropha oil is not desirable for biodiesel production. knutzon et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  have significantly reduced the content of unsaturated fatty acids in transgenic brassica napus by antisense expression of sad gene. complete removal of unsaturated fatty acid was not observed probably due to the presence of more than one sad gene in b. napus. in our study, we found four different transcripts for sad which could be used to design rnai construct for efficient silencing of the expression of sad enzyme in jatropha.

activation and transport of fatty acids
free fatty acids that are released from acyl-acps are converted to respective acyl-coas  by long chain acyl coa synthetase . the activated fatty acids are bound by acyl coa binding proteins  to protect them from acyl-coa hydrolases, and to transport them to endoplasmic reticulum. arabidopsis contains nine lcacs genes  <cit>  and six acbp genes  <cit> . from the current study, we have identified four contigs for lcacs, and three of them were full-length. we also found five contigs for acbps, and two of them were full- length.

synthesis of triacylglycerol or oil
triacyl glycerol or oil is synthesised in er by serial incorporation of three acyl groups to the glycerol backbone. the first acyl group is added to the sn- <dig> position by glycerol-3-phosphate acyl transferase . the resulting lysophosphatidic acid is further acylated at sn- <dig> position by lysophosphatidic acid acyl transferase  to form phosphatidic acid. phosphatidic acid is dephosphorylated by phosphatidic acid phosphatase  to form diacyl glycerol. final acylation of diacyl glycerol in sn- <dig> position to complete the synthesis of triacylglycerol is carried out by diacyl glycerol acyl transferase . these steps are highly amenable for genetic manipulations to increase the oil content. for example, seed oil content was increased by 21% in arabidopsis and 3-7% in canola by overexpressing gpat  <cit>  and dgat  <cit> , respectively. we have identified  <dig> contigs for the four enzymes, gpat . lpat , pap  and dgat  that are required for triacyl glycerol synthesis. these sequences will be useful for increasing the oil content in jatropha by genetic engineering.

functional classification
gene ontology  annotation and classification of the sequences was done based on three gene ontology terms such as biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions. distribution of the contigs in different go categories is given in figure  <dig>  while the contigs covered all the major biological processes, the cellular and metabolic processes alone accounted for  <dig> % of the contigs. regulation of biological processes and response to stimulus accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the contigs, respectively. in cellular components, cell and organelles accounted for the maximum number of contigs . in molecular functions, highest numbers of contigs were classified under catalytic activity  which was followed by transferase activity, protein binding, hydrolase activity and nucleic acid binding activity .

validation of assembled transcripts
the 3' untranslated region alone was rt-pcr amplified for  <dig> transcripts to validate the expression of assembled transcripts. all the transcripts were found to be expressed in all the five tissues studied . whole transcripts were rt-pcr amplified for  <dig> transcripts to validate the expression and contig assembly. as shown in figure  <dig>  all the transcripts were amplified successfully and were of expected size . in addition, in silico validation was done by comparing the assembled contig sequences with  <dig>  high quality and manually edited ests and full-length cdna sequences  obtained from sanger sequencing. we found  <dig> contigs to be fully mapping with the nucleotide sequence from sanger sequencing, and the identity was  <dig> % over a length of  <dig> to  <dig>  bases. when  <dig>  partially mapped contigs were analysed, the identity was  <dig> % over a length of  <dig> to  <dig>  bases. overall,  <dig> , <dig> bases were aligned with  <dig> % identity. these results not only validate the accuracy of  <dig> pyrosequencing vis-à-vis sanger sequencing but also the accuracy of contig assembly.

CONCLUSIONS
we have analyzed the transcriptome from five major tissues of j. curcas using gs flx titanium platform of  <dig> pyrosequencing for the purpose of large scale gene discovery. we assembled  <dig>  contigs and identified  <dig>  new transcripts to add to the existing jatropha genetic resource. currently,  <dig>  non-redundant transcripts sequences are available from jatropha. this includes  <dig> transcripts that are directly involved in oil biosynthesis. these sequences will be useful in genetic engineering of jatropha for increased oil content, modified oil composition, toxin-free oil cake, resistance to insect pests and diseases, tolerance to drought stress etc.
