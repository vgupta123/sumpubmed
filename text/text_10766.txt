BACKGROUND
gene expression analysis is becoming much more prevalent since it promotes our understanding of biological processes. compared with the traditional methods for transcript analysis including northern blot, rnase protection analysis, in situ hybridization and semi-rt-pcr, the fluorescence-based qrt-pcr has recently been considered as the most reliable method for the detection of mrna  <cit>  because of its high sensitivity, no post-pcr processing  <cit> , and wide dynamic range  <cit> , which allows a straightforward comparison between rnas that differ widely in their abundance. furthermore, it is easy to use, allows high throughput production of data and eliminates the need for radioactive isotopes  <cit> . moreover, it is especially suitable when only a small number of cells are available. although qrt-pcr is frequently used due to these advantages, some disadvantages may include variations between samples which may differ in the amount and quality of starting material, rna preparation, cdna synthesis, dilutions and pipetting <cit> . normalizing a target gene to the hkgs makes qrt-pcr reliable by minimizing the variations.

the hkgs, which are referred to as internal controls or reference genes, are presumed to have constant expression level among different tissues and at all developmental stages, regardless of the experimental conditions or treatments. additionally, the hkg and target gene should have similar transcript levels to avoid analytical problems  <cit> . commonly used hkgs are cellular maintenance genes, which regulate basic and ubiquitous cellular functions  <cit> , such as components of the cytoskeleton , glycolytic pathway ), protein folding , synthesis of ribosome subunits , electron transporter , protein degradation , etc. these genes are supposed to have constant expression levels between different samples, and are frequently used as a normalizer without proper validation. however, recent studies show that the transcriptional levels of these hkgs are not always stable, and that no single hkg has a constant level under all experimental conditions  <cit> . a recent study even suggests that such a 'foolproof' gene does not exist  <cit> . the reason for this expression variability may be that the hkgs not only take part in the basic cell metabolism but also participate in other cellular process  <cit> . therefore, selecting a suitable hkg which has a constant expression level in certain experimental conditions for normalization is crucial for getting accurate results in gene expression studies.

recently, many procedures have been constructed to find the best suitable hkg in a set of samples, such as genorm  <cit> , normfinder  <cit> , Δct approach  <cit>  and 'stability index'  <cit> . for example, using genorm, ywhaz, gapd and sdha were found to be the most stable hkgs across the examined embryonic stages in bovine pre-implantation embryos, while the commonly used actb was variably expressed  <cit> . by comparing the expression results of the non-stimulated tissues and leucocytes from atlantic salmon  using the normfinder program, it was shown that ef1-alpha was the most stably expressed gene  <cit> . using the Δct approach, gapdh was found to be the most suitable hkg for expression studies in reticulocytes while the commonly used b2m should be avoided  <cit> . ubq and tua were selected as reference genes to normalize gene expression in a single female poplar hybrid clone  using the 'stability index'  <cit> .

nevertheless, many studies on hkgs selection refer to human or animal tissue. as far as is known, only a few have been focused on plants such as rice  <cit> , poplar  <cit> , potato  <cit>  and arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . moreover, there is no report on soybean , a very important crop and a model plant in the early studies of photoperiodism  <cit> .

photoperiod controls several responses throughout the plant life cycle, such as germination  <cit> , flowering induction  <cit> , post-flowering development  <cit> , maturity, dormancy  <cit> , and yield formation  <cit> . the photoperiodic control of flowering in arabidopsis, a long-day  plant, is a hot topic attracting many scientists to enter this field and helping to better understand the processes involved  <cit> . however, there is little known about the mechanism in soybean, a typical short-day  plant. thus, the understanding of some key genes' expression patterns will help illuminate the mechanism involved in this process. different cultivars of soybean may have different sensitivity to photoperiod; studies of the expression pattern of key genes in the photoperiodic pathway may also help elucidate what leads to the varietal difference.

in the present study, the expression profiles of ten hkgs, including act <dig>  act2/ <dig>  tua, tub, ubc <dig>  cyp <dig>  g6pd, elf1a, elf1b and ubq <dig>  were studied during the development of zigongdongdou , a late-maturing soybean  cultivar, under ld and sd conditions. the expression patterns of the ten hkgs were also detected in soybean cultivar heihe no.  <dig> , zhonghuang no.  <dig>  and suinong no.  <dig> . genorm, Δct approach and 'stability index' were used to assess the value of ten hkgs as suitable internal control for soybean gene expression studies.

RESULTS
expression profiling of hkgs
a qrt-pcr assay, based on sybr green detection, was designed for the transcriptional profiling of ten commonly used hkgs  in soybean. in order to select a reliable set of hkgs, all pcr assays were done in triplicate. to make the comparison among each pcr run reliable, all the ct values were determined at the threshold fluorescence value of  <dig> , and three fixed pcr reactions were performed in every pcr run to make the data from each pcr run comparable. the ct value was used to analyze the transcriptional levels of hkgs. this approach was a simplified way to give an overview of the abundance of the genes in the samples  <cit> . the ten hkgs showed a relatively wide range of ct values from the lowest mean ct value  in cyp <dig>  to the highest  in elf1a in all tested sample pools in soybean. individual hkgs had different expression levels across all the sample pools tested. act <dig> and cyp <dig> showed the smallest gene expression variation , while act2/ <dig>  elf1a, tub and tua had the highest expression variation  as shown in figure  <dig>  the wide expression range of the ten tested hkgs confirmed that no single hkg had a constant expression under these conditions in soybean. obviously, it is necessary to select a suitable hkg to normalize gene expression under a certain condition.

genorm analysis
gene expression stability  of these ten hkgs in various tissue samples under different conditions was measured by genorm as described by vandesompele et al.  <cit> . this approach relies on the principle that the expression ratio of two ideal hkgs is constant in all the samples, independent of the experimental conditions and cell-types. genes with the lowest m have the most stable expression, while the highest m value indicates the least stable expression  <cit> . we analyzed data under seven sets. as shown in figure 2a, when all the  <dig> samples were taken together, the average expression stability value  of elf1b and cyp <dig> was lowest, and that of ubq <dig> was highest, suggesting that elf1b and cyp <dig> had the most stable expression and that ubq <dig> was expressed most variably. the results remained very similar in the different tissues under the same developmental stage series, with the lowest m value for elf1b and cyp <dig> . ubq <dig> remained the least stable gene, while act2/ <dig> and tua were the ones with the lowest m, indicating that they were stably expressed in the developmental series of soybean . in the photoperiodic treatment, act <dig> and elf1b were the most stable genes, while ubq <dig> still was the most variable one . in the different cultivar series, the m value was least for ubc <dig> and tub followed by elf1b, tua, elf1a, act <dig>  while act2/ <dig> was the least stable hkg . in the different time of the day series, elf1a and tua were expressed much more stably than the other eight hkgs, while ubq <dig> continued to be the most variable one . since the hkgs ubq <dig> and act <dig> showed variable expression profiles in a semi-rt-pcr comparison of the unifoliate leaves and a leaf mixture containing all the leaves , the transcriptional expression of the ten hkgs was studied in this series. results from genorm analysis showed ubc <dig> and act2/ <dig> were the least variable ones among the ten tested hkgs, while ubq <dig> was still the most variable one. however, the difference of m value between the less stable hkgs  was minimal .

for some experimental setups, using a single hkg for normalization is appropriate  <cit> , while, for other ones, there may be no single hkg suitable as a reliable internal control  <cit> . therefore, the requirement of two or more hkgs for accurate normalization is necessary. the optimal number of hkgs necessary for reliable normalization is defined by a normalization factor  which is determined by the genorm software. the pairwise variations vn/vn+ <dig> between two sequential normalization factors  are used to determine the necessity of adding the next hkg for reliable normalization  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the two most stable hkgs were found to be optimal for the accurate normalization with a pairwise variation value much lower than the cut-off value of  <dig>  suggested in  <cit> . it was apparent that the addition of the third hkg for normalization would have no significant effect on pairwise variation in the four series as shown in figure 3a. when all  <dig> samples were taken together, the pairwise variation v2/ <dig> was higher than  <dig>  , as was v3/ <dig> . this indicated the addition of the fourth hkg was necessary to normalize gene expression. this situation was similar for the series with different tissues under the same developmental stage. the pairwise variation v2/ <dig> and v3/ <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, both higher than  <dig>  . when looking at the developmental stages, the pairwise variation v2/ <dig> was  <dig> , while v3/ <dig> was  <dig> , so the three hkgs  were sufficient for accurate normalization. when evaluating all the pairwise variation, the least stable hkg was ubq <dig> followed by g6pd as they significantly increased the pairwise variation during the whole assay by increasing the v value as shown in figure  <dig> 

'stability index' assay
a 'stability index' assay was first used to select suitable internal controls during the development of poplar  <cit> . in the current study, the expression stability rank of the ten hkgs in soybean was detected according to the 'stability index'. as shown in table  <dig>  when all  <dig> sample pools were taken together, act <dig> had the lowest stability index and was the most stable hkg. the expression stability rank was as follows: act <dig> > cyp <dig> > ubc <dig> > elf1b > act2/ <dig> > g6pd > ubq <dig> > tub > tua > elf1a.

Δct analysis
the Δct approach was employed by silver et al. <cit>  to select the most suitable hkg in reticulocytes. if the Δct value between two hkgs does not change when analyzed in all the samples, it means either both genes have stable expression patterns or they are co-regulated among those samples. however, the fluctuation in Δct means that at least one of them was variably expressed. introduction of a third, fourth, or fifth gene into the comparisons will provide more information on which pairs show less variability and hence which gene has stable expression among the samples tested. it is easy for large panels of genes to be compared with one another and then selected or eliminated on the basis of Δct. ultimately, an appropriate hkg can be selected for a particular experimental system  <cit> .

the expression stability of hkgs was measured by the Δct value and standard deviation  in the present study as described in  <cit> . taking all ten hkgs into account and comparing all the possible combinations, their expression stability was determined. as shown in additional file  <dig>  figure 4a and 4b, when elf1b and cyp <dig> were compared with the other nine hkgs in their respective gene panels, the mean stddev was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, indicating that elf1b was the most stable one among the ten hkgs analyzed in all the  <dig> sample pools, followed by cyp <dig>  in contrast, when ubq <dig> and g6pd were compared to the other nine hkgs in their respective gene panels, they tended to be associated with the greatest amount of deviation in Δct value , which meant that ubq <dig>  followed by g6pd, were the least stable hkgs in all the  <dig> samples tested. ubq <dig> should be avoided when doing gene expression analysis because of its high deviation in Δct value when compared to the other nine hkgs . elf1a, act11/tua, tub/act2/ <dig> and ubc <dig> all showed intermediate levels of Δct deviation , indicating intermediate stability. overall rankings were as follows: elf1b, cyp <dig>  elf1a, act11/tua, tub/act2/ <dig>  ubc <dig>  g6pd, and finally ubq <dig> 

gmbft expression
the relative expression level of gmbft   <cit> , an ortholog of arabidopsis bft  <cit> , was detected to validate the hkgs selected in the present study under certain conditions according to the genorm manual. the geometric average of the most stable hkgs  in the developmental stage series selected by genorm was used as an internal control. the relative expression of gmbft increased after a 25-day sd treatment in unifoliate leaves, being  <dig> -fold higher than that at 1-day sd treatment . similarly, gmbft expression level was also higher in shoot tips after a 25-day sd treatment compared to the 1-day sd treatment . in the same way, using the geometric average of the most stable hkgs  in the photoperiodic treatment selected by genorm as an internal control, it was found that the relative expression of gmbft expression in both unifoliate leaves and shoot tips at 25-day under sd treatment was higher than that under ld treatment. the expression level of gmbft in unifoliate leaves under 25-day sd treatment was  <dig>  fold higher than that under 25-day ld treatment . likewise, gmbft expression level in shoot tips under 25-day sd treatment was  <dig>  fold higher than that under 25-day ld treatment . as shown previously by genorm in the present study, gapd and ubq <dig> were the most variable hkgs for the developmental stage and photoperiodic treatment series. the relative expression of gmbft in unifoliate leaves and shoot tips was also detected using the two hkgs as internal controls and no significant difference was found.

discussion
qrt-pcr has become a powerful tool for gene expression analysis because of its high throughput, sensitivity and accuracy  <cit> . the use of suitable hkgs to normalize the variation made by rna preparation, cdna synthesis or pcr processing would make the results more reliable. in order to select suitable hkg for normalization, many procedures such as genorm  <cit> , normfinder  <cit> , Δct approach  <cit>  and 'stability index'  <cit>  have been used. since all methods mentioned above are based on the ct value, which is determined mostly by the quantity of cdna  <cit> , the prerequisite for selecting a set of reliable hkg is based on the equal input cdna when doing qrt-pcr. in early studies, the most commonly used method to measure the input cdna was by a spectrophotometer such as nanodrop nd- <dig>  <cit> . considering the importance of input cdna, more than one method should be used to detect its quantity and quality to ensure the cdna equality for each pcr run in order to get reliable results for hkg expression stability analysis. in the present study, cdna was verified by measurements on both the nd- <dig> and sma <dig> spectrophotometers to ensure the equality of cdna in the pcr reactions and reliability of the results when using ct values for analysis.

when gene expression stability in soybean was analyzed by genorm, the most stable genes in the seven series were different as shown in figure  <dig>  in all seven series analyzed, elf1b was the most stable hkg. ubq <dig> and g6pd were the most variable ones, so these genes should be avoided as internal controls when doing gene expression studies in soybean. our findings were in accordance with the result that ubq <dig> exhibited the least stable expression in different tissues or cell types at different developmental stages in rice  <cit> . similarly, in the development of grape berry, ubq <dig> was not the recommended hkg for normalization  <cit> . however, in an earlier study in arabidopsis, ubq <dig> showed highly stable expression  <cit> . an ubiquitin tag is not only used to mark particular proteins for proteolytic elimination, but can also have non-proteolytic functions  <cit>  which may lead to the variable expression of ubiquitin in different plants. g6pd was suggested to be an inappropriate internal control in qrt-pcr studies of estrogens effects in fish  <cit>  and it also showed significant differences in expression between malignant and nonmalignant pairs  of human bladder cancer  <cit> . there are few published works using g6pd as an internal control. this may be because g6pd not only acts as a component of the glycolytic pathway but also participates in other processes as well. thus, the expression profile of g6pd might change according to the corresponding experimental conditions. in the present study, tua was found to be one of the most stable hkgs with the lowest m value in the developmental series in soybean. this result was consistent with an earlier study in poplar with tua as one of the most stable hkgs  <cit> . other most commonly used hkgs, like tub, displayed an unacceptably high variable expression pattern limiting its use as an internal control except in the different cultivar series where all the other hkgs showed relatively stable expression. taken together, these results suggested that these hkgs were regulated differently in each plant species and may exhibit differential expression patterns. therefore, a hkg with stable expression in one organism may be not suitable to normalize gene expression in another organism under a given set of conditions and thus needs to be validated before its use.

to further verify the suitability of hkgs selected in the present study, gmbft expression levels were detected at different developmental stages and under different photoperiodic conditions in soybean . in unifoliate leaves, gmbft expression after a 25-day sd treatment was significantly higher than after a 1-day sd treatment, and was also higher than after a 25-day ld treatment. the case was similar in the shoot tips of soybean using hkgs selected in corresponding conditions as internal controls. the fact that this result is in accordance with earlier work by sun et al.  <cit>  means that the hkgs identified in this study are suitable at various development stages and photoperiodic conditions. the relative expression of gmbft was also analyzed using ubq <dig> and g6pd as internal controls . no significant expression difference of gmbft was observed in unifoliate leaves at different developmental stages or under different photoperiodic conditions. the result was similar in shoot tips. obviously, ubq <dig> and g6pd are not suitable hkgs to normalize gene expression in soybean under such conditions.

the Δct approach  <cit>  and 'stability index'  <cit>  were also used to analyze gene expression stability in all  <dig> sample pools in soybean to compare the accuracy of these three methods. results obtained from the Δct method were very similar to that from the genorm analysis. elf1b was the most stable hkg followed by cyp <dig>  while ubq <dig> was the most variable hkg followed by g6pd. when 'stability index' was used to measure the stability of hkg, results changed, with act <dig> being the most stable hkg followed by cyp <dig>  while tua and elf1a became the least stable ones in all the  <dig> sample pools in soybean. an explanation might be that the 'stability index'did not take the pcr efficiency into account, which played an important role in the data analysis. thus, in order to get a reliable result by only comparing ct deviation for the individual genes in the tested tissue samples, the hkgs analyzed should have similar pcr efficiency.

although gene expression stability analyzed by the Δct approach was similar to that by genorm, it was still not the first choice to get accurate normalization especially for the research which can get enough samples. the Δct method can be used to detect the most stable hkg as genorm provides; however, it could not provide the number of hkgs necessary for accurate normalization. some studies may require more than one hkg to be included, and using the single most stable hkg for normalization might not get the most accurate result. indeed, as shown in figure 3a, when all  <dig> sample pools were analyzed by genorm, the geometric average of four hkgs  was recommended as the normalization factor to get accurate results in soybean. however, the analysis by Δct method only indicated that the most stable hkg was elf1b, and it could not be used to find out the optimal number of hkgs. thus, gene expression accuracy might be undermined if the result is only based on elf1b. it is true that the Δct method is useful for validating the most stable hkg in some specific tissue samples or cell types for which it is difficult to obtain enough material, such as reticulocytes  <cit> . however, for material where rna samples are easy to obtain, such as plants, genorm is recommended because it is easy to determine the optimal number of stable hkgs for accurate normalization.

selection of suitable hkg is necessary for accurate gene expression, but it is quite expensive and time-consuming. to avoid the additional expense and labor of using multiple internal control genes, a potential strategy suggested by brunner et al.  <cit>  was to design a pcr primer pair which could amplify two or more members of a control gene family. however, for two members of the same hkg family, their expression pattern and stability might vary. therefore, results may be questionable for gene expression based on these two hkgs. for example, ubq <dig> was one of the most suitable hkgs in a given set of tissue samples in rice, while ubq <dig> expressed variably  <cit> . a similar situation was observed for the actin gene family in the developmental stage series in the present study. act2/ <dig> was stably expressed, while act <dig> showed variable profiling. thus, using primer pair sets to amplify two or more members of a hkg family for qrt-pcr may not be recommendable. after all, the accuracy of the results should always be given first priority.

the photoperiod plays an important role throughout the life cycle of soybean  <cit> . the sensitivity of different cultivars of soybean to photoperiod is quite variable. understanding the mechanisms involved in this process will be beneficial in the molecular breeding of soybean. in the present study, the most stable hkg in the different cultivar series under the same photoperiodic conditions and developmental stage was ubc <dig>  whereas act2/ <dig> was the most variable one. the difference of average expression stability among the ten hkgs in this series was smaller than that in the other series. thus, the gene expression would be similar using any of the ten hkgs as internal controls when studying different cultivar. it would be helpful to understand the mechanisms involved in differential sensitivities to photoperiod for different cultivars.

CONCLUSIONS
a large number of studies have been carried out concerning the validation of hkg in many different tissue samples and cell types. however, there is no correlative report in soybean, a sd dicot. our data showed the variable expression profiles of ten commonly used hkgs in different tissue samples and under different photoperiodic conditions in soybean. based on genorm and Δct methods, elf1b and cyp <dig> appears to be the most suitable hkgs to normalize gene expression during the development of soybean, while ubq <dig> and g6pd seems to be unsuitable as reference genes. under some conditions, more than one hkg should be used as internal controls to normalize gene expression in soybean in order to get the most reliable results.
