BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small non-coding rnas that can be found in both multi-cellular animals and plants. in both kingdoms they act as negative regulators of translation. they are transcribed as longer primary transcripts from which approximately 70nt precursors  with a characteristic stem-loop structure are extracted; after export to the cytoplasm, the mature mirnas, approximately 22nt in length, are cut out from one side of the precursor stem structure. for reviews on the discovery and function of mirnas we refer to the literature, see e.g.  <cit> .

despite the rapid growth of our knowledge on microrna regulation, little is known about the evolution and phylogenetic distribution of the hundreds of animal microrna families. the exceptions are a few well-studied examples, including let- <dig>  <cit> , the three non-homologous mirna families comprising the mir- <dig> cluster  <cit> , two hox-cluster associated genes mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  <cit> , and the exceptional imprinted mir- <dig> cluster of micrornas located at human locus 14q <dig>  <cit> . these few case studies, which were selected because of special properties of the mirnas in question, of course cannot provide a comprehensive, or even representative, picture of microrna evolution in animals.

two very recent papers discuss in detail the phylogenetic distribution of plant micrornas using expression profiling  <cit>  and est data  <cit> , respectively. both studies demonstrate that "several individual mirna regulatory circuits have ancient origins and have remained intact throughout the evolution and diversification of plants." with only a limited number of mirna families to investigate  the situation is much more favorable than in animals, where the microrna registry  <dig>    <cit>  lists more than  <dig> micrornas which fall into more than  <dig> families defined by their "mir-number"  <cit> . a recent comprehensive study of microrna gene expression in zebrafish  <cit> , for example, lists  <dig> mirna loci in the genome of danio rerio that are homologous to more than  <dig> different mammalian micrornas, belonging to almost  <dig> different families.

in this contribution we report on a comprehensive study of the phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary histories of the currently known mirnas  and their homologs.

RESULTS
novel microrna genes
while micrornas have been studied in much detail in mammals, insects, and nematodes, much less is known in other lineages. information on chicken, frog, and actinopterygian micrornas are almost exclusively based on sequence homology. in this study we have attempted to obtain this information systematically and as exhaustively as possible. to this end, we include only those predicted microrna candidates which can be identified as homologs of a mr  <dig>  entry. note that our statistics ignores all micrornas that are not contained in mr  <dig> , most notably, many of those reported in recent studies of primates  <cit>  and zebrafish  <cit> . while a recent survey for ncrnas has provided evidence for a significant number of micrornas in ciona intestinalis  <cit> , most of them are not included here because their homology with known vertebrate micrornas cannot be established unambiguously.

our knowledge of micrornas in basal deuterostomes is sketchy at best, despite the fact that four genomes are available at various stages of completion. in this survey we detect a number of micrornas in basal deuterostomes:  <dig> sequences in only  <dig> families  were found in the genome of the sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus. most of the  <dig> sequences will probably turn out to be identical in more advanced assemblies of the genome. a handful of families were detected in urochordates. in  <cit> ,  <dig> putative micrornas are predicted in ciona intestinalis, of which only  <dig> are recognizable orthologs of known vertebrate micrornas. it is not clear whether the other candidates are lineage-specific innovations, or whether they are too diverged to recognize their homology with known microrna families.

similarly, we find only three convincing microrna candidates in the trematode schistosoma mansoni: mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  in contrast, no plausible orthologs were detected outside the metazoa e.g. in schizosaccharomyzes pombe or encephalitozoon cuniculi.

phylogenetic distribution of microrna families
the tables in additional file:  <dig> as well as in the summary of microrna precursor sequences, both part of the extensive electronic supplement  summarize the sequences that were found through the combined blast and erpin searches described above. since large-scale experimental surveys that were not based on a priori homology information have been performed only for  <dig> species  we can only analyze the innovation of micrornas along the branches of the phylogenetic tree leading to those four species.

to this end, we map each mirna to the branch that leads to the last common ancestor of all homologs that we could identify in our survey. note that this does not imply that all children of this ancestral node carry a known homolog: mirnas may have been lost in a particular lineage or they may have diverged too far to be recognizable by homology-based searches. we suspect that the small number of identified mirnas in basal deuterostome  and in schistosoma mansoni is predominantly due to sequence divergence rather than true gene loss.

to our surprise, we find that mirna innovation is an ongoing process, exemplified already by the small number of rodent or primate-specific sequences contained in mr  <dig> . recent studies by berezikov et al.  <cit>  and bentwich et al.  <cit>  demonstrate that evolutionary young mirnas are a common phenomenon. many of these are members of large mirna clusters. note that our data set contains at least one representative of many of these clusters, suggesting that expansion of existing clusters is a major mode of mirna evolution. on the other hand, we can clearly identify two edges in the phylogenetic tree along which innovation is concentrated: the edge leading to the ancestral gnathostome, and the edge leading to the ancestral eutherian.

in addition to the introduction of a large number of novel mirna sequences, we find a large number of paralogous mirna sequences throughout the metazoa. two classes of duplication events are easily distinguishable:

• local  duplications result in paralogous sequences that are  located on the same transcript. these gene copies retain their physical linkage over long evolutionary timescales.

• non-local duplications result in paralogous genes  on  different chromosomes. in some cases, copies on the same chromosome separated by large distances are observed, but in these cases the physical linkage is not preserved across larger evolutionary times.

non-local duplications almost exclusively can be allocated to only two points in the metazoan phylogeny: in the stem of the teleost branch and in the edge separating the gnathostome ancestor from the urochordates. this is consistent with the large-scale, probably genome-wide, duplications postulated by the 2r/3r model  <cit> .

as expected, we find no case of a microrna family with more than  <dig> different genomic loci in tetrapods or more than  <dig> genomic loci in teleosts, with the sole exception of the let- <dig> family. in this case, which was studied in detail in  <cit> , at least one non-local duplication event predates vertebrate-specific genome duplications.

indeed, we find that about 50% of the isolated micrornas or microrna clusters that predate the last common ancestor of tetrapods and teleosts appear in at least two separate genomic loci. similarly, about 50% of these "old" micrornas show clear evidence for an additional duplication of at least one copy in the teleosts lineage.

microrna clusters
a substantial fraction of micrornas are located on polycistronic transcripts  <cit> . tab.  <dig> lists the vertebrate microrna clusters. microrna clustering is also a common phenomenon in invertebrates: . the evolutionary history of four microrna clusters has already been described in detail in the literature:

probably the best-understood microrna, at least in terms of its phylogenetic distribution is let- <dig>  which was discovered in c. elegans as a timing regulator in development  <cit> . the let- <dig> microrna is present in diverse animal phyla including chordates, echinoderms, mollusks, annelids, arthropods, nematodes, chaetognaths, nemerteans, and platyhelminths, but it is absent in basal metazoa including cnidarians, poriferans, ctenophora, and acoel flatworms  <cit> . in vertebrates a plethora of let- <dig> paralogs are known. paralogs of the two mirnas mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are transcribed together with some of the let- <dig> paralogs in both vertebrates and insects. for a detailed reconstruction of the let- <dig> gene phylogeny we refer to  <cit> .

the mir- <dig> cluster consists of up to  <dig> members belonging to three non-homologous microrna families: mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  while mir- <dig> can easily be traced back to the common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes, the other two families appear to be younger  <cit> .

the mir- <dig> cluster is a unique system of micrornas located at the imprinted human locus 14q <dig>  <cit>  and the orthologous mouse dlkl-gtl <dig> domain  <cit> . it is restricted to eutherian mammals and consists of  <dig> known groups of micrornas, which, however, according to our analysis share a common origin, see fig.  <dig> below. the most prolific subgroup consists of mir- <dig> and its paralogs, which appear to be rapidly radiating. local sub-clusters of this unique system are studied in detail in  <cit> . these authors also report additional cluster members that are not contained in the mr  <dig> .

the mir- <dig> cluster consists of murine micrornas mir- <dig> to mir- <dig> and their human homologs mir- <dig> to mir- <dig>  it is conserved in eutherian mammals and is rapidly evolving both in gene content and sequence  <cit> .

other mirna clusters have not been analyzed in detail to our knowledge. our own finding are summarized below, see also fig.  <dig>  gene phylogenies of all microrna families are provided in the supplemental material.

the mir- <dig> cluster is ancient, consisting of mir- <dig> and mir-133; . in vertebrates, there are three copies on different chromosomes.

the mir- <dig> family is also ancient. in diptera, we have both an isolated mir- <dig> paralog  and a cluster of four micrornas consisting of mir-9c, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir-9b, see fig. 3a. this cluster, which presumably arose by means of tandem duplications, is specific to diptera. one of the four members of this mir- <dig> cluster, mir- <dig>  is so diverged that its homology with mir-9/mir- <dig> is not unambiguous.

the mir- <dig> cluster arose from an old tandem duplication. it occurs in  <dig> copies in tetrapoda, were one locus has only a single copy of the microrna.

in some cases, even the combination of sequence information and physical linkage is insufficient to completely resolve the history of a microrna cluster. as an example, consider the mir- <dig> cluster, consisting of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  which appear to have unrelated sequences. while tetrapoda have two clusters consisting of all three mirnas, teleost fishes have either four  or five  copies, usually on different chromosomes or at least separated several million bases from each other. fig.  <dig> gives the two most plausible scenarios, both of which are based on the assumption of the 2r/3r model that leads us to expect up to four paralogs in the ancestral vertebrate and a duplication of this ancestral state in the teleosts.

the mir- <dig> cluster consists of the paralogous micrornas mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  the ancient tandem duplication that created this cluster predates the origin of the chordates . in vertebrates there are two copies of the clusters.

the mir- <dig> cluster consists of four tandem copies of mir- <dig> and a single copy of mir- <dig> in amniotes. homologs in more distant groups, including frog and teleosts, could not be identified.

a small number of microrna clusters arose only recently, i.e., after the last common ancestor of eutherian mammals. for example, mir- <dig> arose next to mir- <dig> in the rodent lineage. mir- <dig>  which is located on the x-chromosome, exists in three copies in canis and in two copies in homo, while other mammals have only a single copy.

conversely, a few ancient microrna families have be remodeled considerably in mammals. the mir- <dig> cluster, fig. 3c, may serve as an example. this family arose by tandem duplications very early in vertebrates. an additional copy appears early in the mammalian lineage followed by different lineage specific deletions.

micrornas and repetitive dna
small interfering rnas  are related to retro-elements in plants and fungi: in plants they are known to silence retro-elements  and promoter regions by dna and histone methylation . in s. pombe sirna complementary to centromeric dh repeats  <cit>  and other retrotransposon ltrs  <cit>  are involved in heterochromatin silencing. recently, numerous mammalian mirnas with extensive homology to known repetitive elements were described  <cit> , including rat mir- <dig>  <cit> . these and three further mirna sequences  as well as mir- <dig>  which is discussed in the following section, are excluded from the phylogenetic analysis. they are marked with the symbol ♠ in the summary table in the appendices found in the supplemental material.

the d. melanogaster and d. pseudoobscura mir- <dig> sequences reside in the last intron of the gene encoding the 23s ribosomal protein. candidate sequences in insects were classified as simple repeats or low complexity regions by repeatmasker  <cit> . putative homologs in vertebrates were identified as lines, sines, mer2_type and simple repeats. none of those are associated with rps23s. the mature sequences were not conserved between those candidates, the only feature they had in common were long stretches of a and t rich regions.

the eutherian specific mir- <dig> is located on the x-chromosome. the majority of candidates were identified as l2/lines elements, the remaining ones as sine/alu , and sine/mir . the locus reflects the features of repeat-derived mirnas as described in  <cit> . two l <dig> elements in tail-to-tail orientation form the stem of the pre-mirna, whereas the loop consists of the poly tail  since one of the l2s is found on the minus strand) and the short intervening sequence. in contrast, the sequences of eutherian specific micrornas that are not related to any known retrotransposon are in most cases conserved almost perfectly among different eutherian species.

the mir- <dig> family apparently is derived from a zebrafish repetitive element of unknown type.

tubulin genes and mir-220
the tubulin superfamily comprises  <dig> families  <cit> . three of them, the alpha, beta and gamma tubulins, are ubiquitous for eukaryotes and used for several phylogenetic studies within this kingdom, e.g.  <cit> . multiple highly conserved alpha and beta tubulin genes are found within each species. in addition, several intronless tubulin pseudogenes were found  <cit> , flanked by different repeat regions  <cit> . these remnants of functional genes were, for instance, used as molecular clock for investigating hominide evolution  <cit> .

mir- <dig> was discovered in d. rerio  <cit> , where it is found in the fourth exon of an mrna  that appears to be related to tubulin-beta genes. it can be mapped unambiguously to the minus strand of several d. rerio ests.

the human mir- <dig> sequence was identified by homology to the experimentally verified d. rerio sequence. it is located in a genomic region highly conserved between several vertebrates according to the conservation track of the ucsc genome browser. on the dna sequencing clone rp5-1189b <dig>  this region is annotated as tubulin beta- <dig>  pseudo-gene. the mir- <dig> resides on the opposite strand of this predicted gene at a position homologous to the 5' end of exon  <dig> in the functional tubb <dig>  none of the sequences in the human ests of genbank contained hsa-mir- <dig> 

none of the numerous blast hits for mir- <dig> was identified as a repetitive sequence but rather appear to belong to tubulin genes and pseudogenes. only the human sequence folds into a proper stem-loop structure, whereas the zebrafish microrna results in a branched structure, fig.  <dig>  the multiple sequence alignment does not display typical features of mirnas either. the mature sequence contains one gap in the human sequence and in addition one mismatch. neither the loop region, nor the complementary arm, the 5' and 3' ends of the precursor are highly diverse. furthermore, mir- <dig> would be the first microrna to be processed from the anti-sense strand of a coding exon, a mode of transcription known so far only for cis-acting anti-sense transcripts  <cit> .

taking these facts together, it is conceivable that mir- <dig> is an experimental artifact. at the very least, homologous sequences in species other than zebrafish should not be interpreted as micrornas in absence of additional evidence. we therefore disregard mir- <dig> in our further analysis.

distant homologies
using blast, we have been able to identify a substantial number of micrornas with different microrna registry names as homologs. as a consequence, our survey distinguishes  <dig> microrna families , while our starting point, the mr  <dig> , contains  <dig> different family names for animal micrornas.

in order to detect distant homologies between microrna families that cannot be unambiguously determined from the precursor sequences, we also analyzed the mature micrornas. comparing alignments with shuffled sequences as described in the methods section, we obtain  <dig> pairs,  <dig> triples, and  <dig> quadruples of microrna families at a z-score cutoff value of  <dig> . among them is in particular the entire mir- <dig> cluster, which can also be identified based on the precursor sequences fig.  <dig> 

while mature micrornas are much better conserved than the rest of the precursor sequences, they are at the same time less informative because of their short length . it is therefore not warranted to conclude that mature mirnas which exhibit statistically significant similarities  are true homologs. the observed similarities could also have arisen through convergent evolution. for example, the first  <dig> nucleotides of the mature sequences show highly conserved patterns between certain families of micrornas that regulate target genes of the notch signaling pathway. these motifs have been characterized as gy-box, brd-box, and k-box  <cit> . in general, the corresponding pre-mirna sequences are too divergent to conclude that they derive from a common ancestral sequence.

in four cases we find strong evidence for homology that was not detectable directly by means of blast, see fig.  <dig>  the first two of these cases identify putative orthologs in distant clades:

arthropod-specific mir- <dig> is related with vertebrate-specific mir- <dig>  their mature sequences are 74% identical, the combined stem regions still have about 60% sequence identity. a re-examination of the full precursor sequences leads us to conclude that arthropod mir- <dig> and vertebrate mir- <dig> are indeed orthologs.

similarly, the mature sequences suggest that the nematode microrna mir- <dig> is possibly homologous with mir- <dig> in arthropods and vertebrates. however, the full precursor sequences cannot be aligned convincingly. the z-score of z =  <dig>  is only marginally significant. we hence  count mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> as different families.

in a few more cases, distant putative paralogs can be detected using the z-score measure.

a particularly interesting case is the similarity between the hox-cluster associated mir- <dig> and the mir- <dig> family, which is part of the let- <dig> cluster. they are annotated as members of the single microrna precursor family rf <dig> in the rfam database. the mature sequences are 72% identical, the combined stem-regions share about 50% of the nucleotides, while the alignment of the complete precursor sequences is at the border of significance. in contrast, we cannot confirm that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are putative homologs of mir-10/mir- <dig>  while it is likely that the mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  two old and developmentally important micrornas, are homologous, we still treat them conservatively as distinct families in all statistics reported in this contribution. in any case, the putative duplication from which the mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> families arose, would date back at least to the eubilaterian ancestor.

the alignment z-scores of the mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> precursor sequences also hint a distant homology. the human ortholog of mir- <dig>  designated as hsa-mir- <dig> is located  <dig>  m downstream of the extra copy of the mir- <dig> cluster  <cit>  located at the mammalian x-chromosome. it partially overlaps in its 3' end with the known mrna bc <dig>  of which the third exon is annotated as ensembl gene ensg <dig> with predicted homologs in chimp  and cow . the entire region appears to be specific to mammals, as no homologs in the chicken genome can be found in the ucsc genome browser, although synthenic regions upstream and downstream of the mirna exist on chicken chromosome  <dig>  these genes as well as intergenic regions show roughly two to three-fold compression in chicken, but the region containing the mirna is  <dig> times longer in human. the synthenic region of human xq on chicken chromosome 4p corresponds to a microchromosome in all other birds but galliformes, indicating a spot of heavy rearrangements, which might explain missing sequences  <cit> . the available information is insufficient to determine unambiguously whether mir-322/mir- <dig> is a true homolog of mir- <dig> that arose during the processes that lead to the assembly of the eutherian x-chromosome. thus we conservatively count mir-322/mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> as distinct microrna families.

discussion
the systematic search for orthologs and paralogs of known animal micrornas provides a suitable basis for studying their evolution. while micrornas exist both in multicellular animals and multicellular plants, there is no evidence that particular microrna sequences are homologous between the kingdoms. here we systematically study the evolution of the more than  <dig> known animal microrna families. our analysis identified a substantial number of known micrornas as homologs despite the fact that they have different names in the microrna registry. in a few additional cases, there is at least circumstantial evidence for distant homologies. nevertheless, vertebrate genomes contain almost  <dig> distinct microrna families that do not share significant sequence homology. as most of these families cannot be traced back to an ancestral bilaterian, we have to conclude that micrornas can arise as de novo genes.

the evolution of the metazoan microrna complement is therefore characterized by four processes:

 de novo appearance of novel mirnas. some of these sequences arise as additional members of existing clusters. in  <cit> , a model is proposed for this expansion process based on the fact that hairpins are very abundant rna secondary structures. such innovations occur throughout animal innovation. they are concentrated in the bilaterian ancestor, the vertebrate ancestor, and the eutherian ancestor. the data are at present insufficient to determine whether such periods of increased microrna innovation also happened in invertebrate lineages. however, a small number of micrornas are derived from repetitive elements.

 tandem duplications are a frequent mechanism accounting in particular for the expansion of microrna clusters. such local duplications are also strongly overrepresented in the vertebrate ancestor, and at the origin of placental mammals. in the latter case, most duplications are associated with the mir- <dig> cluster.

 non-local duplications of micrornas are almost exclusively associated with the genome-wide duplication in the vertebrate  <cit>  and the teleost ancestor  <cit> , respectively.

 a small class of non-local duplications is not associated with genome-wide duplication events. the only invertebrate example is the duplication of mir- <dig> in arthropods. in the ancestral eutherian we find  <dig> such events, mostly associated with the formation of the x-chromosome. indeed, the mammalian x chromosome has generated and recruited a disproportionately high number of functional retroposed genes  <cit> , which might also have affected some microrna genes, including the x-chromosomal copy of the mir- <dig> cluster.

CONCLUSIONS
the expansion of the microrna repertoire is consistent with the idea that the complex metazoan genomes require an additional level of regulators  <cit> . as one would expect from such a model, dramatic expansions of the microrna repertoire appear to be associated with major bauplan innovations: in ancestral bilaterians, ancestral vertebrates, and with the advent of  mammals.
