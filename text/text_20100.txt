BACKGROUND
rt-qpcr is a widely used method for analysing gene expression. it has been developed by combining pcr with fluorescent techniques  <cit> . it depends on collecting data throughout the pcr amplification, which is achieved by monitoring the increase in fluorescence intensity of a specific fluorescence dye, which correlates to the increase in pcr product concentration. the major progress of qpcr is that quantification does not have to be done in the plateau phase of amplification, which is a disadvantage of previous quantification methods  <cit> .

pcr can be divided into four major phases: linear ground phase, early exponential phase, log-linear phase and plateau phase  <cit> . during the linear ground phase, only background fluorescence is detected. the early exponential phase starts when the amount of fluorescence is significantly higher than the background. during the log-linear phase, when pcr has reached its optimal amplification period, the amount of fluorescence rises exponentially. in an ideal reaction the pcr products double after every cycle. finally, when the reaction components become limited, the plateau phase is reached and the fluorescence does not increase anymore  <cit> .

relative quantification of rt-qpcr is used to detect changes in expression of the genes of interest relative to a reference gene, which is usually a housekeeping gene. early rt-qpcr studies have assumed that housekeeping genes are expressed constantly over a wide range of conditions. later studies have shown that their expression stability should be proven before choosing them as references, and proposed to use not only one, but several reference genes as internal controls  <cit> .

many approaches are available for relative quantification of gene expression. most of them depend on the principle to define a threshold at which the pcr product fluorescence rises over the background fluorescence. the number of cycles needed until this threshold is reached, depending on the amount of template in a sample, is usually called cq - the higher the template amount, the lower is the cq value. widely used approaches depending on this principle are the 2-ΔΔcq or comparative cq method  <cit> , the pfaffl model  <cit> , or qbase software  <cit> . while the comparative cq method assumes the same amplification efficiency for all amplicons, other methods use serial dilutions of the samples to determine the amplification efficiencies from the increase in the cq value with decreasing cdna input  <cit> . another approach is to determine the amplification efficiency or starting template amount from the increase in fluorescence during the pcr reaction  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to evaluate, whether the different approaches for relative quantification of rt-qpcr generate comparable results. we wanted to find suitable reference genes for normalization of gene expression in a study investigating drought responses of poplar  <cit>  and to test whether the tested methods differ in reliability and suitability for our approach of quantifying gene expression. for this test, ascorbate peroxidase  and superoxide dismutase  were used as target genes, as they play an important role in oxidative stress defence in plants subjected to drought. actin , elongation factor  <dig>  and ubiquitin  were used as reference genes.

RESULTS
evaluation of expression stability of the reference genes
as the reference genes are used to normalize expression of the target genes, they must be unaffected among the samples to be compared. we tested the expression stability of the reference genes by three different approaches presented in the literature  <cit> . the first depends on comparing the cq values of all samples used in an experiment and to calculate the standard deviation  <cit> . the variation in reference gene expression between the different treatments and clones was very low , and we did not find any significant differences between the clones. therefore all three reference genes were assumed to be suitable for normalising gene expression in our experiment.

the second approach assessed expression stability by the slope of the regression line when the cq values are plotted against the respective samples. the lower the slope is, the more stably the gene is expressed  <cit> . as the authors do not give any advice on how to order the samples for regression, we tested two approaches: first we ordered the samples randomly according to poplar clone and treatment, second we ordered them according to the cq values in order to obtain the maximal possible slopes of the regression lines . all reference genes showed high expression stability, the slopes of all regression lines were close to zero. namely, they were  <dig>  for act, and - <dig>  for ef <dig> and ubq, respectively, when ordering the samples randomly. when ordering the samples according to ascending cq values, which maximizes the slopes of the regression lines, the fit was closer than when ordering the samples randomly , but the slopes were still low , indicating that expression of the genes was not altered by the different drought treatments. furthermore, we did not find any significant differences between the cq values of the different clone/treatment combinations.

as third approach for calculation of reference gene expression stability we used the normfinder software  <cit> . it revealed expression stabilities of  <dig>  for act,  <dig>  for ef <dig> and  <dig>  for ubq. comparison with other studies using this program  <cit>  revealed that our reference genes had comparable or even higher expression stability than the ones reported in the literature. this high stability revealed with all applied evaluation approaches  <cit>  might be due to the low number of sample types  as compared to the other studies.

interestingly, the three approaches did not identify the same reference gene to have the most stable expression. according to reid et al , ef <dig> seemed to be the best reference gene   <cit> , according to brunner et al  act   <cit> , and with normfinder ubq  <cit> . nevertheless, the differences in expression stability between the genes were very small and thus we conclude that all three genes are suitable to be used for normalizing gene expression in our study, even when used as reference gene alone. however, it has been shown that the use of several reference genes, which are not regulated under the different conditions between different treatments or tissue types, leads to an even higher reliability of quantitative gene expression studies  <cit> .

importance of amplification efficiency for relative quantification
a major point which has to be considered when using a relative quantification approach is the amplification efficiency. it has been shown that even minor variations in amplification efficiency can lead to considerable variation in the calculated gene expression  <cit> . livak and schmittgen  presented an approach which depends on the assumption that after optimisation of mg2+ and primer concentrations the amplification efficiency of pcr is close to one  <cit> . amplification efficiencies of target and reference genes have to be equal for the method to be valid. to test this, we prepared a dilution series of cdna and plotted the Δcq  against the cdna input . if the amplification efficiencies of two amplicons are similar, the slope of the regression of this plot is close to zero. this assumption is not true for all amplicons and therefore is a limitation of the method. for apx and sod the assumption of same amplification efficiencies as the reference genes did not hold . however, karlen et al   <cit>  have found that the comparative cq method is very robust and can therefore be used at least for approximate estimation of gene expression.

for evaluation of amplification efficiencies two basic approaches have been described. one uses a dilution series of cdna  <cit> . this approach is also used by the pfaffl model  <cit> . the cq values were plotted against cdna input and efficiency calculated from the slope of the regression line according to the equation e =  <dig> . in the investigated range, all amplicons showed relatively high amplification efficiencies,  <dig>  for act,  <dig>  for ef <dig>   <dig>  for ubq,  <dig>  for apx and  <dig>  for sod. it is presumed that the efficiency is the same for all dilutions, however, when a cdna sample is diluted, all compounds, which might inhibit the reaction, are also diluted and therefore can lead to higher amplification efficiencies in the diluted samples  <cit> . this problem can be circumvented by calculating the efficiency directly from the increase in fluorescence in each individual pcr sample, for which two mathematical models have been presented  <cit> .

when using the approach from liu and saint   <cit> , we found amplification efficiencies of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for act,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for ef <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  for ubq,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for apx and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for sod. for this calculation, two arbitrary thresholds within the exponential phase have to be chosen. during evaluation of the method we found that minor variations in the choice of the thresholds can lead to large differences in the calculated amplification efficiency. when using the approach presented by ruijter et al   <cit> , we found amplification efficiencies of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for act,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for ef <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  for ubq,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for apx and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for sod. in this method, the data were log-transformed before calculation of the efficiency from the log-linear phase, and in contrast to the liu and saint method  <cit> , all data points within the log-linear phase were used, which makes it more reliable to detect the correct data points. nordgård et al  have shown that all approaches using the amplification plots of each individual reaction for calculation of amplification efficiencies produce large errors in quantification of gene expression  <cit> . they recommended using rather serial dilutions than individual reactions in order to increase precision. however, in recent years, the approach to use individual samples to determine amplification efficiencies has become more common in relative qpcr studies than using serial dilutions  <cit> . it has been shown that the most reliable approach is to assume the same amplification efficiency for all reactions with the same primer pair  <cit> , to calculate the amplification efficiency from each individual amplification plot, check for outliers and use the mean efficiency for all samples  <cit> .

evaluation of the quantification approaches and comparison of gene expression
we determined the template amount of a cdna dilution series with all quantification approaches  <cit> . by comparing the results with the expected values we found that most of the tested approaches were able to detect the relative cdna amount for all amplicons precisely . only the approach using individual amplification efficiencies, i.e. the liu and saint method  <cit> , showed significant deviations from the expected values. when applying the average amplification efficiency for each amplicon to the liu and saint method, the quality of the prediction of template amount was enhanced, confirming previous findings, that this is the most reliable approach for evaluation of amplification efficiency   <cit> .

accordingly, expression analysis of apx and sod revealed consistent expression patterns in poplar roots under different watering regimes when using the comparative cq method, linregpcr, the liu and saint method with average amplification efficiencies for each amplicon, the pfaffl model and qbase. we found that relative expression of apx was higher in 58- <dig> than in poli, but in both clones not influenced by the treatment. sod expression was highest in well-watered poli and reduced by the drought treatment, but was still higher than in 58- <dig> in both treatments . however, as primer mismatches have been shown to influence target amplification  <cit> , the inter-genotype differences might possibly be due to the occurrence of snps within the primer binding sites. the results obtained with the approach using individual amplification efficiencies  <cit> , showed high variability. its poor performance in detecting the template amount of the cdna dilution series  suggests that the gene expression patterns revealed by this method should be handled with caution. this approach revealed gene expression patterns contrasting to those obtained with the other applied approaches . this result shows that using a relative quantification approach which has not been validated for a certain study might even lead to biological misinterpretation of gene expression data. interestingly, the results obtained with the comparative cq method did not differ from the other methods, neither in predicting the template amount of the cdna dilution series, nor in the gene expression patterns of sod and apx in poplar roots. we would have expected a poorer performance of this method in our study, as the assumption of equal amplification efficiencies of target and reference genes was not fulfilled. however, previous studies comparing relative quantification approaches have shown that the comparative cq method is very robust and can be used at least for approximate quantification in screening of large sample numbers  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
to summarize, we were able to show that the different approaches available for relative quantification of rt-qpcr data differ in their reliability, and that the results computed from the same dataset can differ considerably. the genes act, ef <dig> and ubq selected to normalize expression of the target genes apx and sod have been proven to be non-regulated in the different experimental conditions. in accordance with the literature, the approach calculating pcr efficiencies for each individual reaction  <cit>  produced highly variable results. however, as it has been shown that the use of the mean amplification efficiency for each gene, computed from the individual reactions, is the most reliable approach, we conclude that the use of the liu and saint method is suitable to determine the amplification efficiencies, if the mean value for each primer pair is used for further analysis  <cit> . the good estimation of the template amount of a cdna dilution series with known relative concentrations by the comparative cq method, linregpcr, the liu & saint method with average amplification efficiencies for each amplicon, the pfaffl model and qbase software suggest that these approaches produce reliable results. we do not offer a universal recommendation which approach should be used for relative gene expression studies, but we suggest that investigators should carefully evaluate different quantification approaches before using them in studies analysing gene expression.
