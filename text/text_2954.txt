BACKGROUND
the erbb or epidermal growth factor receptor  family of receptor tyrosine kinases consists of four members: egfr , erbb <dig>  erbb <dig>  and erbb <dig>  under normal physiological conditions, they propagate signals regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, motility and apoptosis. changes in expression and aberrant activation, especially of egfr and erbb <dig>  are associated with a variety of cancers  <cit> . upon ligand binding, egfr undergoes a conformational change that leads to the formation of homodimers  and heterodimers   <cit> . dimerization induces kinase activation and transphosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues in receptor cytoplasmic tails  <cit> . the phosphotyrosine residues serve as docking sites for a large number of cytoplasmic adaptor proteins and enzymes  <cit> . for a given cell type, the specificity and potency of egfr-mediated intracellular signaling is mediated by the cell's repertoire of phosphotyrosine-binding proteins recruited to the egfr cytoplasmic tail.

in this work, we use an agent-based model to evaluate the effects of reaction kinetics, steric constraints and receptor clustering on the docking of four egfr binding partners: grb <dig>  shc, stat <dig> and plcγ <dig>  the adaptor grb <dig> lacks enzymatic activity and consists of one src homology   <dig> domain and two sh <dig> domains  <cit> . its sh <dig> domain docks to specific egfr phosphotyrosine residues and its sh <dig> domains bind to a ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, sos  <cit> . the adaptor shc also binds directly to activated egfr by two distinct phosphotyrosine interaction domains, an nh2-terminal phosphotyrosine binding  domain and a cooh-terminal sh <dig> domain  <cit> . recruitment of grb <dig> and shc lead to activation of erk   <cit> , which translocates into the nucleus and induces gene expression  <cit> . the transcription factor stat <dig> is activated by phosphorylation after docking to egfr or indirectly through src-mediated egfr signaling  <cit> . activated stat <dig> translocates into the nucleus where it regulates the transcription of selected genes involved in oncogenesis  <cit> . plcγ <dig> has two sh <dig> domains, one sh <dig> domain and two pleckstrin homology  domains  <cit> . it is recruited to phosphorylated egfr through its sh <dig> domains, where it serves as a substrate for egfr kinase activity. tyrosine phosphorylation of plcγ <dig> then leads to an increase in its enzyme activity  <cit> . plcγ <dig> pathway plays a significant role in egfr-mediated cell signaling, including calcium signaling  <cit> , receptor endocytosis  <cit>  and cell motility  <cit> . overexpression and hyperactivation of plcγ <dig> has been implicated in breast and prostate cancers, and has especially been linked to cancer cell invasion  <cit> .

the process of signaling through erbb receptors involves highly connected networks of interacting components. improved understanding of receptor signaling through systems biology approaches has a number of potential practical applications, such as the rational design of drugs to treat cancer  <cit> . the accuracy of mathematical models relies heavily on quantitative characterization of signaling components and their interactions, such as measurement of expression levels and reaction rate constants. however, the acquisition of quantitative information is no small task, in part because signaling proteins contain multiple phosphorylation sites and may interact with multiple binding partners. many groups have studied the affinity between egfr phosphopeptides and the binding domains of grb <dig>  shc, stats, and plcγ <dig> using protein microarrays  <cit> , surface plasmon resonance   <cit>  and isothermal titration calorimetry   <cit> . these studies provided estimates of dissociation equilibrium constants  but association and dissociation rate constants of the reactions were typically either not measured or derived indirectly. moreover, none of these measurements were based upon whole egfr within lipid bilayers. to understand distinct recruitment behaviors for the different signaling proteins, it is important to arrive at better estimates of their association and dissociation kinetics. this will require new experimental and computational approaches. in an recent experimental development, morimatsu and colleagues applied single molecule analysis to measure the reaction rate constants of grb <dig> with membranes bearing intact, phosphorylated egfr  <cit> . in this study, we combined several quantitative experimental approaches, including western blotting analysis and semi-quantitative electron microscopy, to evaluate the kinetics of egfr phosphorylation and adaptor recruitment to the plasma membrane of egf-stimulated cells. rate constants for egfr phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and adaptor docking are estimated by fitting this data to simulations in our agent-based stochastic model, signaling pathways simulator   <cit> .

our model specifically considers the phenomenon referred to as combinational complexity, which has been a challenging problem for deterministic mathematical models that employ differential equations to describe cell signaling pathways  <cit> . for example, because the egfr becomes phosphorylated on at least nine tyrosine residues during signaling, there are more than  <dig>  distinct combinations of these phosphoforms for a dimer of egfr. additional molecular diversity can arise when accounting for potential simultaneous interactions of receptor tails with multiple cytoplasmic adaptors. previous models of erbb signaling reduce the problem of combinatorial complexity by making several assumptions, including simultaneous phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of receptor tyrosine residues, representation of all tyrosine residues as a single 'virtual phosphorylation site', and exclusion of multiple cytoplasmic adaptors on the same receptor tail based upon competitive binding  <cit> . in an important advance, blinov and colleagues developed a rules-based model of early egfr signaling events, capable of evaluating more than  <dig> molecular species connected through ~ <dig> unidirectional reactions  <cit> . our spatial stochastic model is also "rules-based" and specifically designed to consider largely unexplored contributions of 1) egfr clustering  <cit>  and anomalous diffusion  <cit> , 2) distinct temporal patterns of egfr tyrosine phosphorylation and 3) the potential for multiple adaptors to bind to the same phosphorylated egfr tail. we refer to the latter concept as "sharing" and base our simulation rules upon the results of coarse-grain molecular docking modeling. in sps, receptors diffuse in the two dimensional plasma membrane. rules established for diffusion in and out of defined subdomains of the membrane  provide a mechanism for receptor clustering  <cit> . we demonstrate that the agent-based spatial model can effectively address problems associated with combinational complexity and make testable predictions about adaptor binding and signaling output that are consistent with novel, quantitative experimental data sets. the simulation results suggest that adaptor sharing is highly dependent on reaction kinetics. the spatial model also predicts receptor clustering results in more efficient adaptor retainment, particularly at normal receptor expression levels.

RESULTS
coarse-grained molecular docking simulations establish rules for competitive or simultaneous adaptor recruitment to the egfr cytoplasmic tail
for convenience's sake, conventional models typically assume that the docking of adaptor proteins is a competitive process  <cit> . nevertheless, it is possible that neighboring phosphotyrosine residues on the egfr tail can recruit distinct proteins at the same time  <cit> , a phenomenon we refer to hereafter as "sharing". in theory, the ability of multiple proteins to dock on the same tail could influence signal transduction efficiency. to address this in our stochastic model, we first sought to establish docking "rules" based upon coarse-grained molecular docking methods.

the fundamental concept in this approach is that coarse-grained molecular docking is similar to assembling a jigsaw puzzle. the docking software, patchdock  <cit> , is based on shape complementary principles and shape matching algorithms. we used patchdock to estimate the capability for combinations of four different adaptor proteins to bind to both tails in an asymmetric egfr dimer . we focused on grb <dig>  shc, plcγ <dig> and stat <dig>  beginning with homology modeling and protein structure prediction methods to arrive at a range of potential 3d structures; details of these approaches are found in material and methods and illustrated in figure 1b. the asymmetric model of the egfr kinase domain dimer was based upon the crystal structure solved by zhang and colleagues  <cit> . in this model, the distal surface of the c lobe of one kinase domain interacts with the n lobe of the other kinase domain in the dimer. in this orientation, only one kinase in the pair is activated, leading to transphosphorylation of the other c-terminal tail. however, if the egfr juxtamembrane domain is flexible, it is possible that the two kinase domains in the dimer can switch positions dynamically to result in activation and phosphorylation of both receptor tails  <cit> . in the simulations described below, we assume participation of both receptor tails in a dimer based upon this flexibility theory. structural details of the c-terminal region of the tail are missing, since crystals were formed from recombinant proteins truncated after the kinase domain. however, the final  <dig> amino acid stretch of the egfr tail appears to lack a predicted secondary structure  and is likely to be highly flexible. this conclusion is consistent with fret studies showing that activation leads to separation of the tail from the tyrosine kinase domain giving a more extended molecule  <cit> .

the docking model is based the assumptions in figure 1c . only four of egfr's phosphotyrosine sites are shown, along with their known interactions with grb <dig>  stat <dig>  shc and plcγ <dig>  the predicted structures of grb <dig>  shc, stat <dig>  plcγ <dig> and the egfr tail were input to patchdock, along with specifications of their domains for docking to defined tyrosine residues in the egfr tail. as expected, many solutions result from this type of simulation. figure 1d-g show examples of the docking configurations predicted by patchdock, with additional examples illustrated in the supplemental data . we focused on situations that permitted multiple adaptors to dock simultaneously, as well as situations that excluded one or more adaptors from docking on an occupied tail. based upon these results, we developed table  <dig> as a foundation for docking rules in the agent-based model. for example, the coarse-grained docking model suggests that the docking of the relatively large plcγ <dig> molecule  to either y <dig> or y <dig> prevents another plcγ <dig> docking at the remaining unoccupied site. stat <dig>  plcγ <dig>  and grb <dig> can dock to py <dig>  py <dig> and py <dig> sites of an egfr tail, respectively, and the coarse grain model suggests any two or all of them can feasibly dock to the tail at the same time . note that we make no claim that the coarse-grain method accurately reflects the orientation of proteins bound in the complex. instead, our goal was to ask if there appeared to be sufficient space to accommodate more than one protein on a given egfr tail. thus, our coarse-grained molecular docking model predicts combinations of the four adaptor proteins that might reasonably be expected to bind a single cytoplasmic domain of egfr. note also that, because the c-terminal tails are highly flexible, no additional hindrances were predicted based upon similar simulations incorporating both tails of an asymmetric dimer .

plus  symbols on the same row indicate where docking simulations support the possibility for this combination of adaptors to simultaneously bind to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the same egfr tail. for example, from the first row, when stat <dig> is bound to py <dig>  either one or both of plcγ <dig>  and grb <dig>  can bind simultaneously. or, any or all of shc , shc , and grb <dig>  can bind simultaneously with stat <dig> .

simulation of egfr phosphorylation/dephosphorylation kinetics
in preparation for spatial simulations, we characterized receptor distributions in egf-treated cells and determined the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation kinetics for each of the four tyrosine residues. our study is based upon data from a <dig> breast cancer cell line. based upon our own flow cytometry measurements of erbb family receptor levels  <cit> , this line expresses over  <dig> million egfrs and very little of other erbb family members. electron microscopy  images in figure 2a report the nanoscale spatial distribution of egfr on membrane sheets produced using the "rip-flip" technique  <cit>  from a <dig> cells after  <dig> hrs of serum starvation and batimastat treatment to prevent stimulation by serum-derived or shedding of egfr ligands. resting egfr are distributed in small clusters , typically with an increase in cluster size following addition of egf . we applied the hopkins test to confirm that egfr distributions are significantly non-random. the hopkins spatial statistical test has been extensively used by our group  <cit> ; a right shift of the data is interpreted as evidence for clustering . western blots in figures 2c-e,g compare the kinetics of phosphorylation on tyrosine residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in egf-treated a <dig> cells, for which reliable phospho-specific commercial antibodies are available. phosphorylation of y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig> all peaked at 30- <dig> seconds; these three residues are grouped into one category that is considered to have "fast" kinetics . phosphorylation of y <dig> peaked at much later time  and is considered to be in a different category with "slow" kinetics . these data were digitized by densitometric scanning and quantitative results plotted as unitless values below each blot in the series. note that resting a <dig> cells have detectable phosphorylation at all  <dig> sites, that increases by  <dig> to 4-fold at the peak values after egf stimulation.

phosphorylation and dephosphorylation rate constants were estimated by fitting to this experimental data, using the time course of py <dig> to represent the "fast" category and the time course of py <dig> to represent the "slow" category. based upon stochastic simulations, we estimate that exposure to  <dig> nm egf should result in 60% of total egfr in a <dig> cells within ligand-bound dimers at steady state. we assumed that ligand-bound dimers have 2-fold higher probability of tyrosine phosphorylation  than do ligand-less dimers. extending our earlier work  is contributed by these predimers. therefore, at t =  <dig>  both categories are assumed to begin with 14% of receptors phosphorylated ; at the peaks for both categories, 60% of the receptors are phosphorylated . the number of phosphorylated receptors at other time points were derived based on the density value at these time points compared to the peak value. using this method, we arrive at < <dig>  py <dig> at time zero, with values of  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> py <dig> at t =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> seconds, respectively.

we used the potterswheel parameter fitting toolbox  <cit>  to estimate the "fast" and "slow" kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation. details of this ode-based approach are found in computational methods. the estimated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation rate constants of the "fast" kinetics category are  <dig>  - <dig> and  <dig> /s, respectively. the rate constant estimated for "slow" kinetics phosphorylation is  <dig>  - <dig>  with a dephosphorylation rate  <dig> /s .

stochastic simulations by sps  <cit>  were used to validate these estimated parameter values. based on a value of  <dig> million receptors per a <dig> cell, the simulated cell membrane area of  <dig>  μm <dig> contained  <dig> egfr particles. to set up the initial condition with 14% egfr predimerized in resting a <dig> cells, we used the receptor conformational flux model from our previous work  <cit> . in this model, collision between two transiently "open", dimerization-competent receptors leads to ligand-independent dimerization. we used a simulation time step of  <dig> μs, a random distribution of egfr, a diffusion rate of  <dig>  μm2/s for receptors, and  <dig> nm egf. ligand binding, dissociation, and receptor dimerization rate constants came from shankaran's model  <cit>  and are found in computational methods. as shown in figures 2f and 2h, simulations run with the estimated parameter values for the "fast" and "slow" kinetics show close agreement with the experimental data.

simulation of kinetics of egfr with its adaptor proteins
the next step was to establish reasonable reaction rate constants for simulating receptor docking and dissociation for the same four signaling proteins considered in table  <dig> . table  <dig> presents a summary of affinities reported in the literature for the binding of sh <dig> and ptb domains to their targets. most studies provide only an equilibrium dissociation constant, kd, although single particle tracking methods were recently used to estimate the multi-state reaction rate constants between grb <dig> and egfr in a <dig> cell membrane preparations  <cit> . our goal was to arrive at rate constants consistent with the range of reported values, but derived by parameter fitting to our own experimental data sets obtained in a <dig> cells.

aspr = surface plasmon resonance, bitc = isothermal titration calorimetry, cnb = no binding

in figure  <dig>  we report results of three complementary techniques to evaluate the time course and extent of recruitment of these four proteins to activated egfr. figure 3a-b demonstrate the use of membrane "rip-flips" and immunoelectron microscopy to document the recruitment of shc to plasma membranes of egf-treated a <dig> cells. in this assay, fixed membranes are incubated with saturating amounts of anti-shc primary antibodies, followed by labeling with secondary antibodies conjugated to electron-dense  <dig> nm gold particles. results of shc recruitment over a time course of egf stimulation are reported in the plot in figure 3c , providing the average number of shc in a  <dig> μm <dig> area of membrane before correction for an estimated labeling efficiency of 70%. with an approximate surface area of  <dig> sq microns for the whole cell, this translates to about  <dig>  shc molecules associated with a <dig> membranes at  <dig> min of egf treatment after accounting for underlabelling. the kinetics of shc recruitment to the membrane compare favorably with the increase in shc that coprecipitated with egfr over the same time course . finally, we used cell fractionation methods to estimate the fraction of shc molecules in both membrane and cytoplasmic pools . extrapolating from the value of  <dig>  shc on a <dig> cell membranes at  <dig> min of egf, with another 50% in the cytosol, we arrive at an estimate of  <dig>  total shc in a <dig> cells. this process was repeated for the other  <dig> proteins , generating estimated values of  <dig>  grb <dig>   <dig>  stat <dig> and  <dig>  plcγ <dig> per cell.

rate constants were next derived by parameter fitting using the potters wheel toolbox, building on the parameters established for phosphorylation kinetics in figure  <dig>  because this is an ode-based approach that assumes a well-mixed chemical system, the docking rate constants were multiplied by a scaling factor  prior to testing for fitness in our agent-based, spatially heterogeneous model. in simulations, the extracellular domain of the model was populated with  <dig> nm egf, the simulated membrane expressed  <dig> egfr, and the intracellular domain contained either  <dig> grb <dig>   <dig> shc,  <dig> stat <dig> or  <dig> plcγ <dig>  simulations were run for each of the four adaptors individually and parameters adjusted to match the experimental data . the docking and dissociation rate constants arrived at for each protein using this computational method are reported in table  <dig>  note that these values are similar to those predicted by single particle methods  <cit>  but that the dissociation rate constants are significantly faster than previously used in deterministic models. as discussed in the context of figure 5c, this has a large impact on the spatial simulation outcome and experimental verification is a priority for our future work.

effect of receptor clustering on efficiency of signal transduction
to this point, simulations were based on randomly distributed membrane receptors, with a uniform diffusion rate of  <dig>  μm2/s. however, as shown in figure 2a-b, egfrs are highly clustered on the a <dig> cell surface. in our prior work, we developed a membrane compartmentalization approach  to simulate receptor clustering in membranes  <cit> . the simulated membrane is populated with subdomains or islands ranging from in size from  <dig> nm <dig> to  <dig> nm <dig> ; the area covered by these subdomains is determined from em images. receptor agents are assigned with a higher probability to enter  than exit  the islands. agents also slow down by a third  when they diffuse within the islands and resume fast diffusion  when they exit the islands  <cit> . to confirm that the simulated data produce non-random distributions, we utilized the hopkins test for clustering. importantly, results show good agreement between both simulated data  and real images .

using this approach, we compared the efficiency of adaptors that are retained on egfr in the randomly distributed and clustered topography. under both conditions, simulations included 20nm egf,  <dig> egfr and  <dig> grb <dig> . in the clustered condition, we compared cluster sizes of  <dig>  and  <dig> receptors per cluster. figure 4c shows histograms plotting the number of events where grb <dig> docked to another receptor within a  <dig> second interval after dissociating from a previous binding event, with comparisons in the three spatial environments. receptor clusters of  <dig> increase the efficiency of grb <dig> rebinding to a second egfr by  <dig> fold, compared to randomly distributed receptors at this normal expression level. overall efficiency of receptor coupling during the first  <dig> seconds is markedly higher in the clustered state . this is consistent with the concept that an adaptor dissociating from a receptor has two possible outcomes: it can diffuse back into the cytosol or collide with the membrane. according to this scenario, receptor clustering creates a local density, increasing the likelihood that the adaptor will collide productively with a nearby membrane receptor.

results in figure 4d show that the increased efficiency of coupling contributed by receptor clustering would be obscured if overexpression creates a high overall density in the membrane. when using conditions applicable to the highly aggressive a <dig> cancer cell line , plots for docking efficiency are essentially identical in the random and clustered state. this supports the hypothesis developed from our previous work that both receptor density and membrane spatial organization may be important factors in the carcinogenesis process  <cit> .

sharing docking model may suggest more efficient and diverse signaling output
in figure 5a-b, we conclude by examining the frequency of simultaneous adaptor recruitment to activated egfr under conditions of normal  and high  levels of receptor expression. rules for permitted combinations of adaptors and signaling molecules on a single phosphorylated receptor tail were based upon our coarse-grained docking approach . this work builds on that described in previous figures, including rate constants for docking and dissociation, as well as phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. the cytosolic simulation space was populated with identical numbers of the four signaling proteins , while receptors varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the case of random topography. to simulate clustered topography for the normal case of  <dig>  receptors/cell, the simulation space was expanded 5-fold, with a corresponding increase in receptors and adaptors to match the new cellular volume representation. for each level of receptor, we compared results based upon the "sharing" docking model with results generated using a "competing" docking model. in the latter case, occupancy of a receptor tail at any given time step excluded another signaling protein or adaptor from binding to the same tail.

simulation results in figure 5a-b are intriguing in that they predict that the capability for "shared" docking does not significantly affect overall recruitment of adaptors, even in simulations using high density of receptors . this result is intuitive in the case of egfr overexpression, where the number of receptors is five times that the total number of the four adaptors . this result was initially unexpected in the case where receptors fall well below the level of adaptors . however, this is explained by the prediction that the shared docking model should be profoundly dependent upon the rate constants applied in the simulation for dissociation of proteins from egfr. this is illustrated in figure 5c, where we substituted our docking and dissociation rate constants for grb <dig>  shc and plcγ <dig> with those of kholodenko's model  <cit> . for stat <dig>  we substituted the kd estimated by shao et al for docking of stat <dig> to the phosphododecapeptide y <dig>  <cit> . the simulations had  <dig> receptors in clustered topography in the simulated space , 20nm egf and the same numbers of the four adaptors as before. figure 5c shows that use of these slower dissociation rate constants results in very large differences in total numbers of adaptors recruited using the two docking models. there are up to  <dig> -fold increases in adaptors docked to egfr at steady state using the sharing model, compared to the competitive model. if the dissociation rate of proteins bound to egfr is slow, the formation of large complexes on the egfr tail is likely to be a frequent event.

discussion
in this work, we apply agent-based, stochastic model to investigate mechanisms of adaptor proteins recruitment to egfr as functions of time, receptor conformation, density and spatial distribution. unique features include the inclusion of docking rules to consider the problem of combinatorial complexity and the consideration of cell membrane heterogeneity. parameter values used in the model were estimated by fitting to our own western blotting and immunoelectron microscopy data from a <dig> cells, which provide evidence of distinct phosphorylation kinetics for different egfr tyrosine residues and distinct behavior for adaptors recruited to phosphorylated receptors. previous models for studying erbb receptor signaling represented all tyrosine residues as a single 'virtual phosphorylation site' and assumed competition among cytoplasmic adaptors for receptor binding  <cit> . the rule-based model of blinov et al  <cit>  can account more fully for potential molecular diversity; however, like others it is a differential equation model that cannot well describe cell surface heterogeneities, such as microdomains  <cit>  or anomalous diffusion of surface receptors  <cit> .

our experimental data for resting cells were derived from serum-starved and batimastat-treated a <dig> cells, conditions that control for serum factors or autocrine stimulation . it is notable that, at t =  <dig>  there are already detectable levels of egfr tyrosine phosphorylation and adaptors docked to egfr . we hypothesize that these are contributed from the ligand-independent egfr dimers as observed by many groups  <cit> . therefore, we made some assumptions when quantifying the western blotting data of receptor tyrosine residues phosphorylation: first, the observed phosphorylation at resting is entirely contributed from transient dimers formed by encounters between conformationally fluxing receptors. this process is density dependent and estimates of these "constitutive" and unstable dimers in a <dig> cells range from 5%  <cit>  to 14%  <cit> ; we use the latter value for our simulations. second, we assume that the rise in tyrosine phosphorylation is equivalent in both receptors within the dimers that form . this may be an overestimate, since it is unknown whether both tails in the asymmetric dimer  <cit>  are equally capable of phosphorylation. indeed, there is evidence that receptor phosphorylation achieves values of only 10-35% in mammary epithelial cells  <cit> , which would be consistent with unequal transphosphorylation by the two kinases in an egfr homodimer. we also ignored internalization of receptors in the present work, although we acknowledge that this may be a component of the "fast" and "slow" kinetics for the four tyrosine residues whose phosphorylation kinetics we studied. the deterministic models of wiley  <cit>  and kholodenko  <cit>  have considered the importance of egfr endocytosis, particularly in the contexts of dimer composition and egfr mutations, and we anticipate adding this feature to the sps simulation model as we learn additional molecular details about the kinetics and docking characteristics of ap <dig> and clathrin recruitment.

based upon parameter fitting, we estimated that the association  and dissociation  rate constants between grb <dig> and egfr are  <dig>  - <dig> and  <dig> /s, respectively. remarkably, these values are very close to the reported rate constants measured by single-molecule analysis -1; koff =  <dig> - <dig> /s) in the same cell line  <cit> . we assumed that shc pdb domain is the predominant means for recruitment to the egfr, with py <dig> as a preferred site and py <dig> as the secondary binding site  <cit> . we arrived at estimated parameter values for shc to these two sites, with a higher kon for py <dig> -1) than py <dig> -1) and the same koff  for both. the estimated kd values of adaptor interactions with egfr in our studies are of the order of  <dig> μm , and these values are close to those in recent reports  <cit> . this relatively low affinity is consistent with the estimates that koff is large, and kon is small, such that adaptors can form complexes with egfr and still can rapidly dissociate to limit signaling duration  or propagate signals . in this context, receptor clustering would promote rebinding to another active egfr and provide a mechanism to enhance signaling efficiency despite high dissociation rates  a high overall density of receptors, typical of cancer cells that overexpress egfr, also creates conditions of enhanced signaling efficiency.

it is important to note that, although simulations with these values agree well with the experimental observations, they are up to  <dig> fold higher  than kd estimates based upon the binding properties of recombinant sh <dig> domain and pdb domain to target phosphopeptides . this is potentially due to "multi-state" interactions between intact receptors and adaptors, as suggested for egfr-grb <dig> interactions measured by single-molecule analysis  <cit> . thus, we caution that the estimated reaction rate constants in this work served solely as references for stochastic modeling. more precise rate constants need to be determined based upon novel experimental techniques for measuring binding between intact molecules in a biological context. as shown in figure  <dig>  the reaction rates have a large impact on the potential for assembly of large complexes on the egfr tail. if dissociation rates are fast, combinatorial complexity will be low. if dissociation rates are slow, there is much greater chance for a single egfr tail to recruit multiple signaling components where permitted by the constraints of steric hindrance.

to our knowledge, this is the first attempt to try to establish rules for simultaneous or competitive docking of adaptors to phosphorylated receptor tails, followed by application of these rules in simulations of single molecule behavior. to accomplish this, we relied upon coarse-grained docking predictions. these methods incorporate information about known or predicted structural domains, using homology and protein structure prediction methods. domains were linked together by an approach previously applied to modeling of large rna  <cit> . each coarse-grained protein structure was then docked, alone or in combination with the other adaptors, to a flexible c-terminus tail of egfr based upon their shape complementary using patchdock. the predicted rules are summarized in table  <dig>  this inexact approach provided several useful exclusionary rules for testing by simulation. for example, plcγ <dig> appears to be sufficiently large that two cannot dock to a single receptor tail, despite the availability of  <dig> distinct binding sites. plcγ <dig> docked at py <dig> likely also prevents shc docking on the same receptor. we emphasize that the limitations of the coarse grain approach raise many uncertainties about these rules. in addition, there are many unknowns related to the asymmetric model of egfr dimer, particularly the assumption that both kinases in the dimer become activated by conformational switching  <cit> . all of these assumptions point to the need for additional experimental validation in order to develop more accurate models.

CONCLUSIONS
mathematical modeling is most useful when it suggests new priorities for coupling of experimentation and simulation. from this work, we identify several areas for future development. first, we seek new insight into the mechanisms that drive receptor clustering and microdomain formation. our simulation results suggest that, when clustering is introduced, adaptors are retained more readily at the plasma membrane. we predict that this efficiency would increase as the receptor cluster size increases . at "normal" receptor expression levels, receptor clustering should create high local density and enhance the probability that dissociated adaptor proteins collide quickly with another receptor. however, simulations also suggest that overexpression of receptors have the same effect as receptor clustering, presumably because an overall high density of receptors improves the chances for dissociating adaptors to rebind. this supports the prediction from our previous work that both receptor density and membrane spatial organization contribute to the carcinogenesis process  <cit> . second, the coarse-grained docking results suggest that simultaneous adaptor docking to a single receptor should be possible but that the significance of this possibility is highly dependent upon the stability of receptor-adaptor complexes. related to this is the need for accurate rate constants for receptor-adaptor complexes. we propose that this effort should take precedence over attempts to confirm the coarse grain docking results, since the problem of combinatorial complexity appears to be minimized if the lifetime of receptor-adaptor binding is short. the sps platform is applicable to modeling these early signaling events and offers capabilities for extending cascades through the cytoplasm and nucleus. it should also be readily adaptable to other protein assembly problems in cells that rely on diffusion and conformational switches. it can explicitly consider aspects of membrane heterogeneity, combinatorial complexity and hierarchy of adaptor binding.
