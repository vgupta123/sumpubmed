BACKGROUND
environmental dna  analyses have demonstrated that diversity records are missing significant data regarding protists . parasitic protists are a key component of food webs, yet the role and diversity of these groups is often unknown . the protist ‘superphylum’ alveolata includes numerous polyphyletic groups of parasites  <cit> , for example: apicomplexa, perkinsea  and syndiniales   <cit> .

molecular surveys have shown that perkinsea-like sequences can be diverse and abundant in freshwater lakes, suggesting this group plays an important role in freshwater food webs  <cit> . however, most freshwater perkinsea have still not been characterised ecologically or morphologically, with one exception, a recently identified perkinsea-like protist linked to local mortality events of the southern leopard frog rana sphenocephala in the usa in  <dig>  <cit> . analysis of the ssu rdna sequence of this protist suggests that this infectious agent branches close to the perkinsea in ssu rdna phylogenies within a cluster consisting of only freshwater environmental sequences  <cit> . with the exception of the perkinsea associated with frog infections, all morphological descriptions and cultured representatives of the perkinsea are derived from two marine genera: perkinsus and parvilucifera.

perkinsus is a group of parasites infecting molluscs and includes p. marinus, the main cause of mortality of bivalves leading to the economically important shellfish disease ‘dermo’  <cit> . parvilucifera spp. are known to infect up to  <dig> different dinoflagellates, playing a role in species succession, for example, infecting dinoflagellates that cause red-tides  <cit> . taken together these data suggest that the perkinsea phylum is a diverse group of parasites infecting a wide range of species such as: molluscs, amphibians and dinoflagellates  <cit> .

numerous clone library surveys of eukaryotic diversity in marine waters have now been published  yet only a few perkinsea sequences have been identified. specifically, only nine sequences belonging to perkinsea that are distinct from either perkinsus or parvilucifera cluster groups are currently available in genbank . to our knowledge, most of the environmental surveys of marine environments have, however, focused on sub-surface or deep chlorophyll maximum  water column samples, with only a few studies sampling sediments . as such, marine sediments are often thought of as a ‘black box’ in terms of microbial diversity and function  <cit> , lacking in eukaryotic-specific molecular surveys . furthermore, the majority of these publications use clone library survey methods and therefore give only a partial view of biodiversity. in contrast second-generation sequencing of environmental sequence tags theoretically allow deeper surveys of microbial biodiversity allowing the detection of low abundance microbes  <cit> . in this paper we use second generation sequencing methods to evaluate the diversity of the perkinsea in multiple marine environments and test the hypothesis that the perkinsea are hitherto under sampled group in marine environments.

RESULTS
processing of sequence data
using  <dig> pyro-sequencing, we investigated the diversity of perkinsea in a selection of european marine samples, sequencing the v <dig> region of the ssu rdna  <cit>  using both rdna and rrna as template. a similar dna-based approach has been used to investigate freshwater perkinsea  <cit> . we obtained sequence data from samples collected in four european coastal sites , including sediment and multiple size filtrates from the sub-surface and the dcm water column samples . all v <dig> sequence reads  were assigned to eukaryotic taxonomic groups using a custom-built pipeline developed by the biomarks consortium . this analysis identified  <dig> sequences preliminarily classified as perkinsea.

the taxonomic affiliation of these sequences was checked using phylogenetic analyses of a ssu rdna dataset comprising representative alveolate groups  and environmental sequences retrieved from genbank . of the  <dig> sequences initially identified as perkinsea, alignment based analyses and phylogeny confirmed that  <dig> individual  <dig> ‘tag’ sequences were not chimeras  <cit>  and branched with known perkinsea sequences. moreover, a large number of the  <dig> sequences were highly similar and so were clustered at 99% identity resulting in  <dig> unique v <dig> sequences branching within, or close to, perkinsea taxonomic groups . table  <dig> summarises the provenance of the sequences sampled and provides information regarding the total % of perkinsea sequences within each v <dig> sequence dataset, which ranges from  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the  <dig> sequencing effort from each of the environments sampled.

the table includes the number of perkinsea sequences recovered while the figures given in the brackets correspond to the percentage of perkinsea sequences compared to the total sequencing effort for each sample.

diversity within marine perkinsea
to investigate the diversity and environmental distribution of the perkinsea-like sequence tags, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis focusing on the v <dig> region and including the  <dig> sequence clusters identified . the regions flanking the variable v <dig> region are relatively conserved, while v <dig> stems and loops are variable  <cit> . the phylogeny was derived from a masked alignment of  <dig> characters and included a mixture of sites with fast and slow patterns of variation. as our analysis was limited to the v <dig> region the deep and intermediate nodes of the phylogeny are poorly resolved so that the tree is only helpful for demonstrating the diversity of perkinsea-like sequences and not the internal topology of the perkinsea group, consistent with the aim of this study.

to identify a conservative picture of perkinsea diversity we classified the sequence diversity into ‘cluster-groups’ on the basis of two restrictive criteria: 1) moderate topology support  and 2) possession of two sequences from separate samples. using this approach we identified  <dig> phylogenetic clusters labeled as cluster 1- <dig> on figures  <dig> and  <dig> in addition to the morphologically characterised perkinsus and parvilucifera groups.  <dig> of these clusters represent previously undescribed marine diversity-groups. additionally,  <dig> unique sequence clusters  were not grouped into ‘cluster-groups’ using our classification criteria.

the  <dig> new marine cluster groups show no more than 97% sequence identity between each group, suggesting they constitute taxonomically distinct groups. in contrast, the four described species that belong to perkinsus spp. have highly similar ssu rdna sequences . if the pattern of ssu rdna variation in perkinsus species is consistent across the wider diversity detected here, then these  <dig> cluster groups are likely to represent a diversity of forms with distinct biological and/or ecological traits, i.e. given the biology of the known perkinsea species the diversity of sequences detected here putatively represent parasites infecting a range of host organisms.

marine freshwater transitions
a growing body of literature has addressed the frequency in which protist groups have spread between marine and freshwater environments  with varying perspectives on the number and relative ‘ease’ of these transitions dependant on the group studied and the criteria used for identifying these transitions  <cit> . as described by bråte et al. in  <dig>  marine-freshwater transitions are likely to have occurred during the diversification of the perkinsea  <cit> . our phylogenetic analyses identified the distribution of sequences recovered from both marine and freshwater environments demonstrating eight putative transitions on the phylogeny . however, we note that only three of these transitions are resolved in our v <dig> phylogenies with bootstrap support in excess of 50%. as such, additional sequencing from a range of environments combined with robust multi-gene phylogenetic analyses is required to characterise the frequency of freshwater-marine environmental transitions within the perkinsea.

the majority of marine perkinsea diversity is recovered from sediments
 <dig>  of the v <dig> sequences classified as perkinsea were recovered from sediment. moreover, 27% of the total sequencing effort were sampled from rna derived cdna libraries  suggesting that a significant proportion of the perkinsea sequences were recovered from ribosomally active and intact cells. a large proportion of published environmental sequences are derived from dna, a method that potentially detects dead organisms or extracellular dna  <cit> . this is an issue arising from edna sequence surveys of sediment/soil environments. in contrast, extracellular rna is thought to be less stable so that the use of rrna can be useful for identifying ribosomally active microbes, inferring intact cells, but not distinguishing between active, senescent, dormant or encysted cells  <cit> . therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the perkinsea detected here are in a dormancy period or ‘dying’ whilst still maintaining transcription of a detectable rna profile. however, these analyses identify a diverse range of ribosomally active perkinsea in marine sediments, while in contrast recovering very little evidence of perkinsea in the water column.

CONCLUSIONS
it has previously been suggested that syndiniales, including marine alveolata group i and ii, predominate as parasitic protists in marine waters  <cit>  while it has been suggested that in freshwater environments perkinsea might play analogous roles in terms of diversity and abundance  <cit> . the data presented here indicate that the situation is not so clear-cut and supports the conclusion that perkinsea are a hitherto under-sampled, diverse, widespread and active group in marine sediments, although the abundance and diversity appears to be somewhat lower than that observed for syndiniales in marine water column samples  <cit> . in contrast, the perkinsea, apart from previously described groups, appear largely absent in the four european marine water columns sampled here. although we note that absence in the water column may be an artefact produced by: 1) limited detection of perkinsea by the sequencing methods employed here which is likely to be abundance-dependant and therefore prone to miss low abundance groups, and 2) an incomplete sampling of the environments, for example exclusion of certain size fractions, time series, and sampling across a diversity of abiotic gradients.

these results are based on  <dig> methods targeting a broad spectrum of eukaryotes followed by bioinformatics extraction of perkinsea-like sequences. such approaches can lead to partial detection of target groups, dependant on level of sequence saturation achieved and comprehensiveness of the primers selected. in reality achieving single gene-marker primers that allow comprehensive sampling combined with sample saturation is experimentally difficult, unless a narrow group is targeted. as such, future work should incorporate a multiple -group specific- primer approach in order to improve sampling of perkinsea diversity and map their environmental distribution. a major challenge of future work is to elucidate the ecological roles of this diversity of perkinsea putative parasites revealed by edna surveys.
