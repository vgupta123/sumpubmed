BACKGROUND
the main aim of our molecular modelling investigations was to identify natural compounds for their ability to bind to the nf-kappab p <dig> as a strategy to identify molecules exhibiting inhibitory activity on the molecular interactions of the transcription factor with its target dna sequence. p50–p <dig> heterodimer is the predominant nf-kappab complex in t-cells regulating hiv- <dig> infection and recent studies have shown that p <dig> unit of nf-kappab is the one that mainly interacts with hiv- <dig> ltr  <cit> . the specific protein residues involved in dna binding to the hiv- <dig> ltr nf-kappab sites  have been identified  <cit> . structurally different inhibitors of the nf-kappab/dna interactions with a rather low binding constant  are reported in the literature  <cit> . recently, some molecular modelling studies have predicted possible binding mode of the inhibitors molecules to the dna binding region of subunit p <dig>  starting from the crystallographic structure of the nf-kappab homodimer  <cit> .

in particular, sharma et al.  <cit>  in an effort to rationalize the results obtained from emsa studies on a set of aurintricarboxylic acid analogues, employed docking studies to explain the structure activity relationships observed within this class. to the best of our knowledge, nowadays the identification of new lead compounds for nf-kappab inhibition through virtual screening of structures libraries is not yet reported in literature. in this paper, we present docking studies on a series of natural compounds previously identified within medicinal plant extracts by us, into nf-kappab p <dig> protein target. after evaluation through electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we obtained a fairly good agreement between experimental data and molecular modelling identification of bioactive and inactive compounds.

methods
docking studies
ligands data and preparation
the database of  <dig> natural structures used in our molecular docking studies, were derived from different medicinal plant extracts  as prepared in our laboratory. a dataset of  <dig> active compounds used as references molecules were collected from four publications  <cit>  reported by one laboratory . ten of these inhibitors  were employed in starting docking studies  and in the standard similarity scoring for subsequently docking simulations.

two inhibitory molecules  were used as test set in all docking simulations. the three-dimensional models of all the molecules under investigation were built by assembling fragments from the sybyl  <dig>  software package standard library  <cit> . resulting geometries were optimized and molecular charges were assigned by a semi empirical molecular orbital calculations using the am <dig> hamiltonian  <cit>  .

proteins data and preparation
the three dimensional structure of the complex nf-kappab-dna  <cit>  was retrieved from the protein data bank . the cocrystallized dna macromolecule was removed from the structure. p <dig> dimer and p <dig> monomers  were selected for the docking simulations and prepared using the graphical interface maestro  <cit> . all water molecules were removed, the hydrogen atoms were added to the proteins and all atom force field  charges and atom types were assigned. preparation and refinement were done running proteinprep job on the structure in a standard procedure. minimizations were performed until the average root mean square deviation of non-hydrogen atoms reached  <dig>  Å.

docking simulations
all molecules of plant extracts  and the known inhibitors  under study were docked in to the binding site of the receptor  using glide  software from schrodinger  <cit> . grids were prepared for each proteins with the exact same center and the size of the bounding box set on  <dig> Å. the coordinates of the enclosing box  were defined starting from the set of active site residues involved in hydrogen bonds with the nf-kappab recognition site of dna  and optimised including the double strands dna helices volume by visual inspection. the glide algorithm is based on a systematic search of positions, orientations, and conformations of the ligand in the receptor binding site using funnel type approach. the search begins with a rough positioning and scoring phase that significantly limits the search space and reduces the number of poses to be selected for minimization on the precomputed opls- <dig> van der waals and electrostatic grids for the protein. the 5– <dig> lowest-energy poses obtained from this stage are subjected to monte carlo simulations and the minimized poses accepted are then rescored using the glidescore function, which is a more sophisticated version of chemscore  <cit> . this force field include additional terms accounting for solvation and repulsive interactions. in order to provide a better correlation between good poses and good scores, glide extra-precision  mode was subsequently used on the conformations selected from glide standard precision  mode. the atom-pair superimposition of p <dig> chains a and b, prepared as described above, gave a minimum rmsd of  <dig>  Å . considering the clear dependence of the docking accuracy of ligands on the protein structure, docking simulations were carried out with the same protocol on both a and b, considered as two slightly different conformations of the same structure.

unfortunately, complexes of nf-kappab cocrystallized with inhibitors has not been solved. therefore, a common self-docking procedure to evaluate the accuracy of the docking protocol adopted was not practicable. in order to overcame this situation, two structurally similar active compounds  were used as test set and docked into the dna binding site of the protein. moreover in following docking jobs, atom pair similarity  scoring  facility as implemented in glide, was incorporated in glidescore , based on the assumption that closely related chemical structure should share similar biological activity and physiochemical property  <cit> . similscore can have a value between  <dig> and  <dig> as implemented in glide. the adjusting g-score value is illustrated here below:

 <dig>  if  <dig>  ≤ similscore <  <dig>  → g-score = g-score+ <dig> 

 <dig>  if  <dig>  ≤ similscore <  <dig>  → g-score = g-score+/* <dig> 

 <dig>  if  <dig>  ≤ similscore <  <dig>  → g-score = g-score+ <dig> 

all inhibitors molecules, except for 9i and 10i, were used just as reference structures for ap similarity method.

based on the best final glidescore ranking, the similarity docking procedure for subsequently docking simulations on p <dig> subunits was chosen.

preparation of nuclear extracts
nuclear extracts were prepared as described  <cit> . cell were washed twice with pbs and detached by trypsinization. after homogenization with dounce b homogeneizer, nuclear proteins were obtained and protein concentration was determined using bio-rad protein assay. nuclear extracts were brought to a concentration of  <dig>  μg/μl for electrophoretic mobility shift assay  experiments  <cit> .

electrophoretic mobility shift assay 
emsa was perfomed as previously described  <cit> . briefly, double-stranded synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides mimicking the nf-κb binding site present in the promoter of the il- <dig> gene  have been employed. oligodeoxynucleotides were labeled with γ32-p-atp using  <dig> units of t4-polynucleotide-kinase  in  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> mm dtt,  <dig> mm spermidine,  <dig> mm edta in the presence of  <dig> μci γ32-p-atp) in a volume of  <dig> μl for  <dig> minutes at 37°c. reaction was brought to  <dig> mm nacl and  <dig> ng complementary oligodeoxynucleotide was added. reaction temperature was increased to 100°c for  <dig> minutes and left diminishing to room temperature overnight. nuclear extracts from ib3- <dig> cells or purified nf-κb p <dig> dimer protein  were used at the specified concentrations and poly  was also added to abolish nonspecific binding  <cit> . after  <dig> min binding at room temperature, the samples were run at constant voltage  under low ionic strength conditions  on 6% polyacrylamide gels. gels were dried and subjected to standard autoradiographic procedures.

cell cultures and infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa
ib3- <dig> cells have been obtained from lgc promochem  <cit> . cells have been grown in lhc- <dig> basal medium , supplemented with 5% fbs in the absence of gentamycin  <cit> . all culture flasks and plates have been coated with a solution containing  <dig> g/ml bovine collagen ,  <dig> g/ml bovine serum albumin  and  <dig> g/ml human fibronectin  as described. p. aeruginosa, pao <dig> strain, was grown in trypticase soy broth  or agar  . bacteria colonies from o/n cultures on tsa plates were grown in  <dig> ml tsb at 37°c. ib3- <dig> cells were infected with ranging doses of pao <dig> at 37°c for  <dig> hours.

quantitation of transcripts of inflammatory genes
total rna from ib3- <dig> cells was isolated using high pure rna isolation kit   <cit> . total rna  was reverse-transcribed to cdna using the high capacity cdna archive kit and random primers  in a 100-μl reaction. the cdna  was then amplified for  <dig> pcr cycles using the platinum® sybr® green qpcr supermix-udg  in an abi prism  <dig> sequence detection system . the real-time pcr reactions were performed in duplicates for both target and normalizer genes. primer sequences for detection of il- <dig> mrna were gaccacactgcgccaaca  and gctctcttccatcagaaagttacataattt. primer sets were purchased from sigma-genosys . results were collected with sequence detection software . relative quantification of gene expression was performed using the comparative threshold  method as described by the manufacturer . changes in mrna expression level were calculated following normalization to calibrator gene  <cit> . the ratios obtained following normalization are expressed as -fold change over untreated samples.

RESULTS
docking analysis
the docking results for all the reference inhibitory compounds and the natural compounds under study are reported in table  <dig>  and in table  <dig> . as shown in the  <dig>  Å crystal structure, the dna/p <dig> complex is formed by one dna molecule and two p <dig> proteins each one consisting of two distinct domains connected by a10-residue linker. both domains and the segments that connects them, form a sequence-specific dna-binding surface by contributing  <dig> loops per subunit that fill the entire major groove of the dna. the specific interactions that stabilized the nf-kappab/dna complex, occur over 10-bp forming the kb recognition site. unlike many dimeric protein-dna complexes, many residues of both subunits make specific base contacts in a non-contiguous cooperative network. the plasticity of centre region of the interface carry to the lack of symmetry exhibited by the interactions of lys  <dig> from the linker segment, and lys  <dig> and arg  <dig> from the dimerization region with the symmetrical target site  <cit> . in the subsequent experimental emsa studies, a recombinant p <dig> protein that probably forms a monomer-dimer mixture in binding buffer solution will be used. on the base of structural and experimental assumptions as above mentioned, p <dig> dimer and monomer were employed as protein target in our molecular modelling investigation.

in order to evaluate the impact of the introduction of the similarity penalty in the docking algorithm on the results, the positions of 9i and 10i used as test set in the final glidescore ranking were compared in the two different procedures .

known active compound 10i was ranked at the top positions in both procedures, but only the introduction of the similarity parameter in the scoring function significantly increased the efficiency in 9i ranking . in fact the difference in glide-score among these two inhibitors with a similar inhibitory potency   <cit>  was very small . for each selected ligand the pose with best e-model score  was used for in-deph interaction analysis. compound  <dig> clearly showed highest score in respect to docked plant extracts  outranking the known inhibitors at physiological ph in docking simulation to the dimer.

docked compounds 1– <dig>  9i and 10i, occupied a region of the binding surface creates by the spatial relationship between the n-terminal domain of p <dig> subunit and the  <dig> residues long linker loop . molecules  <dig>  9i and 10i  were located in a small cleft surrounded by several polar amino acids  and the highest score poses were superimposable with minimum rmsd of  <dig>  Å for compounds 9i and  <dig>  the rmsd was calculated by superimposing the following atoms pairs: heteroatoms involved in hydrogen bonding with the same residues of the protein   and the centroid of aromatic system of coumarin structure with the centroid of benzene ring of  <dig>  these compounds showed slightly different binding modes in p <dig> , p <dig>  and p50-p <dig> targets. here we reported the highest score poses obtained from docking protocol including the similarity function. h-bond interactions between oh groups of coumarin structures  and both nh of his <dig> and the carboxylic group of asp <dig> showed to be important for ligands binding.

moreover, oh groups of coumarin moiety  made an additional hydrogen bond with co of the backbone and protonated nh <dig> group of lys <dig> . it is important to note that lys <dig> could be involved in the stability of the dna-binding conformation of the protein. in fact, as discussed above, this residue is situated in the flexible linker segment and interacts with lys  <dig> and arg  <dig> from the dimerization domain. finally, carbonyl group of 10i engage another h-bond with nh of the backbone of the leu <dig>  compound  <dig> showed the same binding mode of active ligands in the monomer configuration of the target, with the only difference of a stronger interaction of carboxylate group with lys <dig> .

interestingly, the best pose of compound  <dig> occupied a region formed by residues of both p <dig> units  of nf-kappab dimer: lys  <dig> and thr <dig> of chain a and tyr <dig>  lys <dig>  lys <dig>  glu <dig>  cys <dig>  thr <dig>  lys <dig> of chain b. in particular, the oh group of the ligand engages a hydrogen bond with the sidechain of thr <dig> , and the carboxylate group forms a salt bridge stabilized by two hydrogen bonds with the side chain of lys  <dig> . moreover the phenyl structure of compound  <dig> could be involved in a weak π-π stacking interaction with the aromatic moiety of tyr <dig>  , a residue specific for kb dna sequence 5'-gggatttcc-3', present in different cellular genes including hiv-ltr. of course, further dynamics simulation on the protein-ligand complex should be necessary to validate this hypothesis. in addition, the amino group of lys <dig> of the opposite p <dig> unit  could form an additional π-cation interaction with the aromatic group of  <dig>  . these bridge structures are likely to reinforce the anchoring of this molecule to the dna binding region of the dimer, and might account for the slight better g-score of  <dig> in respect to the monomer configuration of the receptor. moreover, all the residues of the protein involved in molecular interactions with molecule  <dig>  form hydrogen bonds also with dna.

all compounds with higher glidescore and e-model score clearly showed the ability to make a maximum number of hydrogen bonding, according with the result as previously reported on a flexible docking studies of known inhibitors 9i and 10i  <cit> , even if reported residues involved in binding interaction were different. the highest ranking poses of  <dig>  9i and 10i formed 3– <dig> hydrogen bonding with the target protein, whereas molecules in medium positions in docking ranking not more than  <dig>  according, structures not involved in hydrogen bonding were ranked in the last positions . in particular, compound  <dig> with a glidescore <  <dig> in similarity protocol lost the ability both to occupy the same positions of active ligands and to form hydrogen bonding with the protein . in house experimental data were in good agreement with the molecular modelling findings. in accordance with docking results,  <dig> and  <dig> showed to be active and inactive respectively in further emsa experimental studies.

effects of compound  <dig> on nf-kappab/dna interactions
the effects of compound  <dig> on nf-kappab interactions were first studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assay  as described elsewhere  <cit> . it is indeed well accepted that molecules binding nf-kappab might retain inhibitory activity on molecular interaction between nf-kappab and dna  <cit> . accordingly, we performed emsa in the presence of increasing amounts of compound  <dig>  in addition, compounds  <dig> was used as possible negative control. this compound, indeed, is expected, from the docking analysis , to be less active. in addition, extracts from cupressus pyramidalis were also used, since this extract does not inhibit nf-kappab/dna interactions . finally, the known inhibitory compound 9i was used as reference molecule. the results of the gel retardation analysis are shown in figure  <dig> and clearly demonstrate that compound  <dig> inhibit the molecular interactions between nuclear factors  or isolated nf-kappab p <dig>  and a target double stranded oligonucleotide mimicking the nf-kappab binding sites. this effect was similar to that exhibited by the reference compound 9i. interestingly, compound  <dig> and extracts from c. pyramidalis were found to be inactive , fully in agreement with the docking data summarized in table  <dig> 

biological effects of compound 21: inhibition of pseudomonas aeruginosa mediated increase of il- <dig> mrna
several experimental model system are available for biological validation of molecules inhibiting nf-kappab function. in a recent paper we report that decoy oligonucleotides targeting nf-kappab are powerful inhibitors of pseudomoas aeruginosa mediated induction of il- <dig> in cystic fibrosis ib3- <dig> cells  <cit> . besides the importance of these data for the theoretical point of view, our results are of great interest for the practical point of view, suggesting this treatment as a possible strategy for the therapy of inflammation associated with cystic fibrosis.

when the effects of p. aeruginosa infection on the expression of pro-inflammatory genes of ib3- <dig> cells infected for  <dig> hours are analysed, the results shown in figure 8a are obtained. in this preliminary experiment the content of rnas coding for several pro-inflammatory proteins was analysed by rt-pcr. the results obtained indicate that il- <dig> mrna sequences sharply increases following pao <dig> infection by  <dig> folds  in respect to basal level of uninfected cells, assumed to be  <dig>  in addition to il- <dig> mrna, other genes induced by pao <dig> are gro-γ , il- <dig> , il-1β , icam- <dig> . on the contrary, very low increase of accumulation of ip- <dig>  rantes, mip-1α, tnf-α, ifn-β, tgf-β and il- <dig> mrna was observed under these experimental conditions.

since nf-kappab is one of the most important transcription factors regulating the expression of il- <dig> gene  <cit>  and the data reported in figure  <dig> demonstrate that compound  <dig> inhibit nf-kappab/dna interactions, we tested the activity of this compound in inhibiting the expression of il- <dig> gene in ib3- <dig> cells infected with pao <dig>  cells were exposed to different concentrations of compound  <dig> and then infected with  <dig> cfu/cell of pao <dig>  after  <dig> hours, cells were harvested, rna extracted and quantitative rt-pcr analysis performed. the results obtained  demonstrate that compound  <dig> is a strong inhibitor of pao- <dig> induced accumulation of il- <dig> mrna.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present work, we carried out docking studies on the dataset of  <dig> molecules found in different plant extracts to nf-kappab-p <dig>  with the purpose of developing a docking protocol fit for the target under study, eventually applicable for more time-consuming virtual screening of larger database of compounds.

usually, docking to protein structures that do not have a ligand present, as in the case of nf-kappab, dramatically reduces the expected performance of structure-based methods. therefore, the use of nf-kappab as a target for virtual docking of natural compounds is not feasible. to overcome such a limitation, we proposed to enhance the simple docking procedure by means of a sort of combined target- and ligand-based drug design approach. advantages of this combination strategy, based on a similarity parameter for the identification of weak binding chemical entities, are illustrated in this work with the discovery of a new lead compound for nf-kappab. in this respect, this paper represents the first example of successfully individuation of a potential lead compound through molecular docking simulations on a nf-kappab target. at the same time, information derived from this structure and its different binding modes, could carry through further lead optimization to more potent nf-kappab inhibitors.

in order to validate the approach, biochemical analyses based on emsa were performed on compound 21; the results obtained sustain the concept that the docking performance is predictive of a biochemical activity .

our results are of interest also from the practical point of view. the transcription factor nf-kappab is indeed a very interesting target molecules in the design on anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic drugs.

in order to validate this last hypothesis, we have employed human cystic fibrosis ib3- <dig> tracheal epithelial cells. we have elsewhere reported that these cells activate, upon exposure to the bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa , the expression of several pro-inflammatory genes, including those coding interleukin- <dig>  and interleukin- <dig> . as supported by several groups, the expression of il- <dig> is dependent from nf-kappab activation. accordingly, decoy molecules targeting nf-kappab are strong inhibitors of the il- <dig> expression. therefore, pao- <dig> infected ib3- <dig> cells are a very interesting model system to screen for il- <dig> inhibitors. the results of our experiments, in agreement with both docking and emsa data, demonstrate that compound  <dig> is a strong inhibitor of il- <dig> and should be considered of interest for modulation of the expression of this gene.
