BACKGROUND
membrane proteins are essential in several cell processes and participate in a wide variety of functions, including playing pivotal roles in signaling pathways, acting as regulatory elements, functioning as receptors, and also facilitating the transport of ions and molecules across the impermeable lipid bilayer  <cit> . due to their diverse and important functional activities, membrane proteins serve as major targets for pharmaceutical industries  <cit> . approximately 20–30 % of most animal proteomes are transmembrane proteins, which in humans amounts to ~ <dig> proteins . the preponderance of membrane proteins attach to the membrane with transmembrane α-helices, while the rest are characterized by transmembrane β-strands forming β-barrels. previous topology based analyses of membrane proteins in the human genome have shown that the largest category of α-helical membrane proteins is composed of only one transmembrane spanning helix, while the second largest category includes the two transmembrane helix containing proteins  <cit>   <cit> . in particular, several studies point toward a strong correlation between membrane protein structure and function and that the number of transmembrane helices substantially determines what function the protein carries out . moreover, analyses of structural topologies of membrane proteomes have shown that the c-terminus is predominantly located in the inside of the membrane, as found across humans  <cit> , escherichia coli  <cit>  and saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , and can be engaged in activities such as stabilization, signaling, protein interactions, and channel gating amongst others  <cit> . this c-terminus localization is ubiquitous as the majority of proteins containing odd numbers of helices, such as those in the large 1tm and 7tm groups, have intracellular c-termini with n-termini in the extracellular environment, and protein groups with even helical numbers have a greater amount of both termini located intracellularly. our earlier complete curation of the membrane proteome in the human genome showed that certain membrane topologies are more common for specific functions such as enzymatic activity, receptors, and transporters  <cit> . for example, the majority of receptors fall into two major categories: those that contain either one transmembrane helix , or the well-studied 7tm g protein-coupled receptor  group  which composes 67 % of human receptors  <cit> . this means that receptors have a greater number of their n-termini in the extracellular environment, which functions in activities such as protein interactions, protein targeting, and signaling  <cit> . transporters, another well-researched group, tend to have six or more membrane-spanning helices, such as the solute carriers  that contain 10–14tm  <cit> . however, membrane bound enzymes generally contain fewer helices and they largely fall within 1tm or 2tm containing proteins.

among these tm families that are categorized by the number of α-helices that span the membrane, the four-transmembrane helix containing proteins are characterized by an array of protein families, such as the neurotransmitter gated ion channels, claudins, connexins, and tetraspanins, that display large degrees of diversity in their functions. neurotransmitter gated ion channels  mediate a rapid transmission of signals at chemical synapses and are a heavily investigated group that act as both receptors and transporters  <cit> . they have four evolutionarily and structurally related 4tm families that include  <dig> members  <cit>  plus one more family consisting of one gene, zinc activated ligand-gated ion channel   <cit> . claudins are another major 4tm family and are one of the main structural components of tight junctions and mediate cell-cell adhesion. there are currently  <dig> mammalian claudin members that are found solely in epithelial cells.  <cit> . they contain the pmp22_claudin domain  which is a member of the transporter superfamily clan, as well as two conserved cysteine residues in extracellular loop one, and most claudins contain a pdz binding motif at the c-terminus position  <cit> . connexins, which are also members of the transporter superfamily clan, have been extensively studied as they are the structural components of gap junctions, which are involved in cell-cell communication. there are  <dig> different connexin proteins described by several conserved features: a four membrane-spanning domain  and a conserved three-cysteine residue domain  found on each of the two extracellular loops. and finally, the tetraspanins include  <dig> members in which some members have a wide and abundant distribution throughout tissues and others are more selectively expressed  <cit> . these ‘true’ tetraspanins  contain the tetraspanin functional domain , which is a member of the tetraspanin-like clan, as well as a conserved ccg motif with 4– <dig> conserved extracellular cysteine residues  <cit> .

within these larger protein families, selected proteins have been well characterized, however there still remain many 4tm proteins that have yet to be fully classified. to the best of our knowledge, the complete complement of four-transmembrane helical containing proteins has not been characterized before in any vertebrate genome, and curation of the 4tm component of the human genome can provide an important basis to understand the diversity of the important 4tm proteome. first, we aim to provide a qualitative functional classification of the complete 4tm dataset screened from the latest release of the human genome . second, we sought to analyze whether there is any correlation between the topological orientations  and their functional activities, that is if certain topologies are favored for certain functional classes. third, we aim to identify how many of these 4tm proteins are associated with diseases and how many of them are potential drug targets.

here, we present the first complete gene repertoire and detailed functional classification of the human four membrane-spanning protein dataset.

RESULTS
identification and curation of the 4tm dataset
a combination of in silico automatic classification followed by individual sequence curation was used to analyze proteins with four membrane-spanning regions . the initial human proteome contained  <dig>  protein coding sequences, and after excising signal peptides  <dig>  4tm sequences were initially predicted using topcons-single. the predicted dataset was reduced by selecting the longest sequence length per unique gene , re-evaluated by topcons-single, and the non-redundant dataset includes  <dig> proteins. this dataset does include proteins that may have incomplete sequences that do not contain initial and/or terminal residues; that are possibly false-positive hits from topcons-single; as well as proteins that are isoforms and contain incomplete functional domains. additionally, the proteins need to be evaluated for annotation quality and protein validity, i.e. that they have recognized protein-coding descriptions with acceptable transcriptional support.fig.  <dig> . automatic and manual classification process. part 1a: schematic diagram of the automatic classification process. the first step in the automatic characterization process included downloading the homo sapiens proteome from the genome reference consortium human genome  <dig>  release with the gencode annotation information. signalp standalone was used to assess and excise any signal peptides. the four membrane-spanning regions were predicted using topcons-single, which comprises five different prediction tools and returns a consensus decision of the number of transmembrane areas. the longest sequence for each genomic location, or gene, was then selected and then those sequences were re-evaluated with topcons-single. uniprot, which is a large comprehensive repository of protein sequences with both manually curated and automatically generated annotations, was used to download associated annotations for each sequence in the predicted dataset. part 1b: schematic overview of the manual curation process for each individual sequence. the purpose of the individual sequence inspections was to ensure the 4tm dataset was composed of valid proteins with four membrane-spanning regions so that the function could be inferred and described. the predicted dataset was evaluated for validity and reliability using the ccds dataset. the predicted dataset includes proteins that may be fragments, possible false-positive hits from topcons-single, and protein isoforms that contain incomplete functional domains. the uniprot annotation data included information such as whether the sequence was a fragment or not, any associated pfam functional domains or families, the transportation classification  number, the enzyme commission  number, as well as gene ontology annotation terms



the predicted proteins were evaluated for validity and reliability through comparison with the ccds dataset and then further manually refined . the 4tm dataset includes  <dig> sequences identified as fragments. there are  <dig> proteins established as isoforms that include  <dig> proteins that contain pfam functional domains that are cited through literature as containing more than four helices, indicating the protein has an incomplete domain and consequently functionality cannot be inferred. additionally,  <dig> proteins have been identified through literature and database resources as suspected false-positive hits from topcons-single. none of these proteins are included in the 4tm unambiguous dataset. forty additional proteins were manually evaluated and added to the dataset to include members of known 4tm protein families . the final dataset includes  <dig> unambiguous 4tm proteins, representing a single protein product from each gene. these  <dig> proteins are categorized into five major groups based on functional, structural, and/or evolutionary similarities: transporters , enzymes , dual function , receptors , and miscellaneous . the proteins identified as miscellaneous are further classified into subgroups with similar functions based on go terms, pfam domain descriptions, and protein family descriptions.

functional classifications
transporters
the transporter category is the largest functional group with  <dig> proteins that are further divided into seven different classes . proteins identified with a transport classification number  are included in this functional class. the alpha-type channel  is the largest group and contains  <dig> proteins. alpha-type channels transport solutes such as potassium, calcium, sodium, and chloride ions through transmembrane pores or channels via an energy-independent process  <cit> . eight of these proteins function as subunits in gap junctions, where six are connexins and two are pannexins. there are two proteins within this group that are identified as drug targets: b-lymphocyte antigen cd <dig>  is involved in the regulation of b-cell activation and proliferation; and calcium release-activated calcium channel protein  <dig>  which mediates calcium influx following depletion of calcium stores  <cit> . sixteen genes in the alpha-type channel proteins are identified in various disease conditions and several of the most common disorders are displayed in fig.  <dig>  for a complete overview of the dataset including gene-disease associations, see additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> the human 4tm transporter class. the figure shows the  <dig> proteins of the transporter class that are further categorized into seven different subclasses. the transporter classification number  is determined by the transporter classification database, which has been cross-referenced through uniprot to obtain the tc number associated with the protein. the tc system is specific for membrane transport proteins and includes both functional and phylogenetic information in the numbering information. the transporter proteins identified as drug targets and the drug indications are also presented. an updated dataset of all current targeted and potential proteins and genes involved in drug studies or experimentation was used to identify proteins that are drug targets as well as the drug indications. in addition, the top common gene-disease associations are displayed for each subgroup, with the number of proteins involved in parenthesis. three different resources were used to identify gene-disease associations: the online mendelian inheritance in man  database; the functional disease ontology  resource; and the jensen lab diseases database . proteins that participate in transport activity but do not have an associated tc number are not included in this class, but rather in a subgroup of the miscellaneous proteins. the number in parenthesis represents the number of proteins that have been identified in that group



eighteen proteins are identified as auxiliary transport proteins  that facilitate transport across membranes but do not directly participate in the transport process  <cit> . eleven of these proteins belong to the transporter superfamily clan and six proteins are true tetraspanins. all eight proteins that belong to the paracellular channel: claudin tight junction class  contain the pmp22_claudin domain  and are members of the previously described claudin proteins. paracellular transport transpires outside of cells and solutes passively follow concentration gradients or transcellular electrical potentials  <cit> . four proteins are identified as putative transport proteins  where transport function has been suggested for them, but evidence is not yet complete and these proteins will eventually be classified elsewhere or eliminated  <cit> . two of these putative transporters contain the marvel domain : occludin  is a member of the tight junction associated marvel proteins   <cit>  and is involved in several diseases including cancer and neurologic disorders; and synaptophysin  is involved with structural functions and in targeting vesicles to the plasma membrane  <cit>  and is also involved in cancer, alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and mental retardation. four proteins are porters  that use a carrier-mediated process to catalyze solutes through the membrane  <cit> . p-p-bond hydrolysis-driven transporters , which hydrolyze atp to drive the active transport of solutes, includes just one protein . recognized transporters of unknown biochemical mechanism  comprises five proteins, of which three are members of the transporter superfamily clan.

enzymes
the enzyme class includes  <dig> proteins with a corresponding enzyme commission  number . oxidoreductases  that catalyze oxidation/reduction reactions in which h and o atoms or electrons are transferred from one substance to another include  <dig> enzymes. there are varied specific functions within this group, including iron ion binding and lipid metabolic processes  <cit> . transferases  are the largest enzymatic group with  <dig> proteins, and  <dig> of these contain the zf-dhhc palmitoyltransferase functional domain  which is involved in zinc as well as other ion binding  <cit> . while there are  <dig> mammalian dhhc proteins identified in the membrane proteome  <cit> , only  <dig> of them are predicted to have 4tms. there are two proteins described as hydrolases , which use hydrolysis to form two products. three proteins are lyases  and two of these contain the protein tyrosine phosphatase-like protein domain  which functions in very long chain fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> . all three lyases are involved in a variety of disease conditions. and three proteins are classified as ligases  in which all are involved as e <dig> ubiquitin ligases.fig.  <dig> the human 4tm enzyme class. the figure displays the  <dig> proteins identified with an ec number that belong to the enzyme class. the enzymes are divided into five groups which correspond to the type of chemical reaction that they catalyze. uniprot cross-references the enzyme nomenclature database and intenz  to obtain the ec number associated with a protein. the single protein classified as a drug target as well as the drug indications are displayed. the drug target and drug indications were identified through an updated dataset of all current targeted and potential proteins and genes involved in drug studies or experimentation. some of the most common gene-disease associations are also shown for each of the subgroups in the enzyme class. three different resources were used to identify gene-disease associations: the online mendelian inheritance in man  database; the functional disease ontology  resource; and the jensen lab diseases database . proteins that are involved in enzymatic activity but do not have an associated ec number are not included in this class, but rather in a subgroup of the miscellaneous proteins. the number in parenthesis represents the number of proteins that have been identified



dual functions
forty-seven proteins are distinguished as having dual functions as either receptor/transporter  or enzyme/transporter  . the complete repertoire of the 4tm neurotransmitter gated ion channel family, also known as the anionic and cationic cys-loop receptor group, includes all  <dig> proteins that belong to four different families as well as the single zinc activated ligand-gated ion channel protein . the four families include gamma-aminobutryic-acid , glycine, 5-hydroxytryptamine- <dig> , and acetylcholine  receptors and each protein contains the conserved neurotransmitter ligand binding domain  as well as the ion channel domain . all  <dig> ngic proteins are described with a tc number as well as being identified as a receptor. in addition, these proteins are characterized by extracellular n- and c-termini. thirty-five of the proteins are identified as drug targets which include a range of indications, as shown in fig.  <dig>  the common disease conditions include neurological diseases such as epilepsy, autistic disorder, schizophrenia, alzheimer’s disease, various dependencies, as well as different cancers.fig.  <dig> proteins identified in the dual functions class. the figure shows the  <dig> proteins identified as having specific dual functions. all of the neurotransmitter gated ion channel  proteins are presented here, which include  <dig> members that are characterized by being a transporter and having a tc number  as well as being identified as a receptor. the ngic are divided into their five different protein families, and the number of proteins identified as drug targets and the drug indications are presented. in addition, one protein is determined to be both an enzyme and transporter and the information is presented in the bottom row of the figure. the drug target and drug indications were identified through an updated dataset of all current targeted and potential proteins and genes involved in drug studies or experimentation. the gene-disease associations for all ngic proteins are also displayed. three different resources were used to identify gene-disease associations: the online mendelian inheritance in man  database; the functional disease ontology  resource; and the jensen lab diseases database . the number in parenthesis represents the number of proteins that have been identified



receptors
the two proteins identified solely as receptors each belong to different receptor types. the first receptor is the high affinity immunoglobin epsilon receptor subunit beta  and is a member of the ige receptors, which combine with specific molecular sites on the surface of b- and t-lymphocytes. this protein is also identified as a drug target and is used as an anti-asthmatic agent. the second receptor is the type- <dig> angiotensin ii receptor-associated protein  and is a cell surface protein that binds angiotensins, which cause vasoconstriction that increases blood pressure, and activates intracellular changes that influence cell behavior. the receptor class was identified using manual screening with two resources: the medical subject headings   <cit>  database and iuphar/bps: guide to pharmacy  <cit> .

miscellaneous
many of the  <dig> proteins classified as miscellaneous are multi-functional and involved in a variety of activities. fourteen of the miscellaneous proteins have signal peptides predicted and five proteins have extracellular terminal locations predicted. fig.  <dig> shows several of the larger subgroups of proteins with similar functions that have been categorized using go terms. the subgroups are meant to show the broad activities within the dataset and present some of the main functional tasks and how many proteins are involved in them. these functional subgroups can be composed of a single protein family, for example all  <dig> proteins associated with gap junctions are connexins, or be characterized by several different families, such as the  <dig> proteins involved in cell adhesion .fig.  <dig> the functional subgroups of the miscellaneous class. the graph displays the breakdown of the larger functional subgroups that contain  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins that belong to the miscellaneous class, as well as the remaining  <dig> proteins under various functions. the subgroups were determined by individually examining go  and go  terms as well as pfam domain and protein family descriptions to categorize proteins with similar functions. many proteins participate in multiple activities, and the subgroups are meant to highlight some of the main functional tasks within the dataset and how many proteins are involved with them. the transport activity column includes the four subgroups transport activity, vesicle mediated transport, chemotaxis, and channel activity and totals  <dig> proteins altogether. the receptor-like activity column includes both the signaling and regulation subgroups and totals  <dig> proteins as well



two of the miscellaneous proteins are identified as drug targets. one is gap junction alpha  <dig> protein , which is a connexin subunit and plays a possibly critical role in hearing and in bladder functional capacity  <cit> . it is being investigated for use as a wound healing accelerant  <cit> . the other identified drug target is leukocyte antigen cd <dig>  – a tetraspanin that is involved in negative regulation of cell proliferation and positive regulation of immunoglobulin production, amongst other functions  <cit> . this protein is being targeted as a possible anti-neoplastic agent in cancer treatment.

uncharacterized proteins
thirty-two of the miscellaneous proteins have an uncharacterized function and twenty-four of these proteins have a recognized pfam domain. within the uncharacterized proteins, there are six interesting clusters of sequences: there are two sets that each have three members with the same conserved domain ; three sets of proteins with two members each that have the same domain ; and a sixth group with two proteins that do not contain a conserved domain, but share ~38 % sequence similarity and belong to the same protein family. . in addition, there are three proteins that have possible homologue hits through blastp searches and two proteins that have conserved domains that were identified through the conserved domain database; the reticulon domain and the claudin  <dig> superfamily, which contains the claudins. several of the clusters and homologue hits are discussed below, because while the uncharacterized proteins do not have any associated function ascribed to them through go terms, valuable information was gleaned through literature searches.fig.  <dig> uncharacterized proteins. this figure presents the six sets of uncharacterized proteins that have multiple members with the same conserved pfam domain or high sequence similarity. in addition, five uncharacterized proteins that have either conserved domains or hits through blastp searches are also shown



tmem50a and tmem50b  both contain the upf <dig> pfam domain  and are the sole members of the tmem <dig> protein family. tmem50a is located on chromosome 1p <dig>  in the rh gene locus, between the rhd and rhce genes, where its position may be linked to rh haplotypes and contribute to selective pressures regarding certain rh haplotypes  <cit> . according to the gene expression omnibus   <cit> , tmem50a appears to be highly upregulated in late stage cervical cancer in comparison to normal cells. in a study that assesses biomarkers to investigate the etiology of down syndrome, tmem50b was found to be upregulated two fold in down syndrome samples compared to normal  <cit> .

tmem14b  is a member of the tmem <dig> protein family which includes tmem14a, tmem14b, tmem14c, tmem14d , and tmem14e, of which tmem14b and tmem14c are predicted as 4tms. according to a recent  <dig> article  <cit> , nmr shows that 4tms are predicted in tmem14a and tmem14c, but only  <dig> tms span the entire membrane. perhaps this contributes to tmem14c as one of the few proteins with the n-terminus predicted to be located in the extracellular environment. tmem14a/b and c are located on chromosome  <dig> and tmem14e is located on chromosome  <dig>  only one gene, tmem14c, has any associated function – heme biosynthetic process activity; all others have yet to be characterized. however, in yeast tmem14a stabilizes the mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibits retinamide-induced apoptosis  <cit> .

neither tmem <dig> nor tmem179b  contain a conserved pfam domain but they share ~38 % sequence identity and belong to the same protein family. no function could be found associated with these proteins, however an article from  <dig>  <cit>  identifies tmem <dig>  which is located on chromosome 14q <dig> , as an ‘evolutionary breakpoint’ region. this region is repeat rich and ‘reused’ during karyotypic evolution in that breakpoint features that are retained may have predisposed these genomic regions to large scale chromosomal instability.

tmem <dig> and tmem <dig>  both contain the pfam domain tmem185a , which is also conserved in the proteins tmem185a and tmem185b . this domain has been identified to be involved with the fragile-x syndrome through the protein tmem185a  <cit> , however tmem <dig> and tmem <dig> share only ~10 % identity to the tmem185a/b proteins and ~21 % identity between each other. in a recent publication, the previously uncharacterized tmem <dig> protein was described as an evolutionarily conserved regulator of intracellular calcium levels that is required for spermatogenesis  <cit> .

fam189a <dig>  fam189b, and tmem <dig>  each contain the cd <dig> domain , which is a member of the tetraspanin-like clan. all three are uncharacterized, however fam189b has been shown to possibly interact with the ww domain binding and be involved in protein binding  <cit> . additionally, the three proteins tm4sf <dig>  tm4sf <dig>  and tm4sf <dig>  all contain the l6_membrane domain , which has unknown functions. however, there are three other proteins in the tm4sf protein family with the l <dig> domain and two are involved in regulation and signaling while the third is a transporter.

major pfam families and clans within 4tm dataset
there are eight major pfam domain families and clans within the dataset that contain between 5– <dig> members : transport superfamily clan , tetraspanin-like clan , marvel-like clan , zinc beta ribbon clan , ngic family , reticulon family , l6-membrane family , and got1/sft2-like family . the clans are composed of homologous domain families and include the unique four-transmembrane protein families such as claudins, connexins and tetraspanins. the domain families are formed from the collection of proteins with the same conserved pfam domain, such as the  <dig> members of the ngic family, and which do not belong to any clan and thus do not have any identified homologous sister families.fig.  <dig> functional classification breakdown within the 4tm major clans and families. the figure displays the breakdown of how many proteins within each major clan and family are identified for each functional class, i.e. transporter, enzyme, dual function, receptor, and miscellaneous classes. approximately 61 % of the dataset is described by these eight clans and families. the number in parenthesis corresponds to the total number of proteins within that clan or family



the largest clan, the transport superfamily clan, comprises  <dig> proteins from six different conserved pfam domain families. the six families within this clan include: the aforementioned connexin domain ; pmp22_claudin ; claudin_ <dig> ; l_hgmic_fpl ; gsg- <dig> ; and innexin . the predominant functions include cell adhesion, transporter activity, regulation, and cell communication via gap junctions.

the tetraspanin-like clan is the second largest clan with  <dig> proteins and is composed of two families: the ‘true’ tetraspanin domain family  and the cd <dig> domain family . the ‘true’ tetraspanins are involved in transport activity and have also been identified as building tetraspanin enriched domains  that facilitate protein scaffolding and assembly of specialized complexes  <cit> . the other domain family, cd <dig>  appears to be cell-surface proteins that are involved in important cell regulation and differentiation activities, as well as possibly facilitate intracellular protein-protein interactions  <cit> .

the  <dig> proteins that contain the marvel domain belong to the marvel-like clan. five of the marvel proteins are classified as transporters while others have shown association with specialized membrane microdomains  that could be involved in cholesterol-rich membrane apposition events in cellular processes such as biogenesis of vesicular transport carriers or tight junction regulation  <cit> . the eighteen proteins in the zinc beta ribbon clan contain the zf-dhhc domain and act as transferases. the  <dig> members of the ngic family has been discussed previously and the seven proteins in the reticulon family are involved in activities such as transport and regulation as well as the apoptotic process, but one of them is also completely uncharacterized. the last two domain families include the six proteins of the l6-membrane family in which several are involved in transport and regulation, however three of them are also completely uncharacterized, and the five proteins of the got/sft2-like proteins that function in vesicle mediated transport.

some members of these homologous families have been well-studied; however there are others that are still not fully described. for example, of the  <dig> members of the claudin family, only limited functional knowledge is available on at least  <dig> of the proteins: claudins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 20– <dig>  <cit> . additionally, meaningful go functional terms are lacking for at least five proteins of the ‘true’ tetraspanins , as well as at least eleven proteins that contain the cd <dig> domain and are members of the ms4a protein family which is involved in important cell regulation and differentiation activities.

disease-gene and cancer associations and drug targets
there are  <dig> genes identified with disease conditions. various types of cancers, such as lung, colon, breast, and liver, are the most common diseases identified with  <dig> genes recognized in association with them. many of the genes are described in multiple disease conditions, as can be expected from the critical functional activities that membrane proteins participate in. there are  <dig> genes associated with epilepsy,  <dig> genes with schizophrenia, and  <dig> with autism. conditions involving deafness are associated with  <dig> genes;  <dig> genes are involved with nicotine dependence; diabetes, alzheimer’s disease and alcohol dependence each have  <dig> genes identified with them. as ngic receptors are involved in a plethora of neurological disease conditions, it is not surprising that disease conditions such as schizophrenia, autism, alzheimer’s and dependence/addiction are heavily represented. additional file  <dig> includes the complete gene-disease association descriptions. there are  <dig> proteins identified as a current targeted or potential protein that is involved in drug studies or experimentation, with  <dig> of them identified in the ngic family.

topology
in addition to the number of membrane spanning helices, the orientations of the n- and c-termini are important factors in determining the functional activity of the protein. the terminal orientations are usually determined by the initial insertion of the peptide into the membrane, however the presence of a signal peptide can influence different orientations. signal peptides are short sequences of amino acid residues attached to the n-terminus domain that target the protein to the membrane and are then subsequently removed by proteolysis post membrane insertion. in addition, when using transmembrane protein prediction methods, it is important to assess and excise signal peptides from sequences as otherwise they can be mistaken as transmembrane helices due to the hydrophobicity of the peptide sequence  <cit> . the results of the topcons-single topology predictions for this dataset include  <dig> proteins with the n- and c-termini located within the lumen of the membrane and  <dig> proteins with the terminals in the outside environment. the complete ngic group, which compose virtually all of the dual function class with  <dig> proteins, have the n- and c-termini located in the extracellular environment. the extracellular n-terminus is consistent with the other large receptor groups, i.e., the 1tms and 7tms, however the c-terminal is usually located in the intracellular environment due to the important activities it is typically involved in, particularly signaling transduction. additionally,  <dig> of the ngic proteins are predicted from the signalp signal peptide prediction software to have signal peptides. in total there are  <dig> proteins that are predicted to have signal peptides. as current transmembrane protein prediction methods are based on classical helical structures, i.e. those that completely span the membrane, they do not take into account anomalies such as reentrant loops, short breaks in helices, and helices that lie along the surface of the membrane  <cit> . as mentioned previously with tmem14c, this method limitation could possibly affect the topology prediction. for example, those  <dig> proteins that have predicted extracellular orientation  might be interesting proteins to study for transmembrane structural purposes. examples of common structures and topologies for each functional class are represented in fig.  <dig>  which highlights conserved features and n- and c-terminus orientations found in the 4tm dataset. for example, claudins, tetraspanins, and connexins categorized in the miscellaneous class are shown with the four conserved membrane regions, the intracellular location of the n- and c-termini, and also conserved cysteine residues that are often found in the extracellular loops and are involved in forming disulphide bonds.fig.  <dig> . common topologies and conserved features within the 4tm dataset. part a the miscellaneous class includes proteins that have been characterized into subgroups through similar functional activities. common features include intracellular termini and conserved cysteine residues  in the extracellular loops that either engage in forming disulphide bonds  or interact and form bonds with other proteins . tetraspanins have 4- <dig> conserved cysteine residues as well as a conserved ccg  motif in the large extracellular loop  <dig>  part b the example here, ms4a <dig>  is one of the two identified receptors and a member of the ms4a protein family, in which  <dig> members are characterized by 4tms, a cd <dig> domain, and an in n-terminus. part c the transporter class includes  <dig> proteins, of which  <dig> have an in n-terminus and conserved cysteine residues in the extracellular loops are common. tmem <dig> is the sole transporter with the opposite topology, and is interesting due to its use of novel mechanisms in cisplatin  resistance  <cit> . part d of the  <dig> enzyme class proteins, all except five maintain an n-terminus intracellular location. zdhhc- <dig> is a typical protein of the zdhhc protein family, characterized by 4tms, a conserved dhhc domain, and a conserved dpg  motif as well as a ttxe  motif. part e the dual function class contains  <dig> proteins and all  <dig> proteins of the neurotransmitter gated ion channel family  are included here. the ngic family has a long extracellular n-terminus that contains several important binding sites as well as two conserved cysteine residues that participate in disulphide bonds. the ngic family is unique in that it has extracellular n- and c-termini and also has signal peptides predicted in  <dig> of the proteins



discussion
this consensus topology based screening of 4tms followed by manual curation presents the most robust and updated dataset of the 4tm complement of the human proteome. our initial screening of the human proteome predicts  <dig> sequences with four membrane-spanning helices and this estimate is comparable with the human tissue-based protein atlas database that currently predicts  <dig> sequences with four-transmembrane regions  <cit> . both of these 4tm prediction datasets include all protein products , and the protein atlas database also uses a majority decision method but with seven different prediction methods based on the ensembl gene annotation. our protein dataset consists of  <dig> members after manual curation and also appending  <dig> selected proteins, which represents 7 % of the ~ <dig> human membrane proteome. this dataset contains  <dig> more predicted proteins that what was previously estimated in our human membrane proteome, which also accounted for a single protein product from each gene, obtained from the ipi human version  <dig>  in  <dig>  the different number of predicted proteins might be attributed to our manual curation process, as well as different number and types of prediction methods and different gene annotation sources. there are  <dig> proteins characterized in the dataset, which amounts to approximately 91 % of the proteins having an associated description.

transporters make up the largest category of 4tms and consist of 37 % of the dataset, with 17 % identified solely in the transporter class, an additional 12 % in the dual function category, and 8 % more in the miscellaneous class that are members of subgroups such as transport activity, vesicle mediated transport, channel activity, and chemotaxis . in the entire human membrane proteome  <cit> , transporters compose approximately 15 % of the proteins, which shows that the 4tm dataset contains more than double that amount proportionally. and when comparing against the 6tm protein set, another membrane group known to be involved in transport activity, roughly 30 % of that group of proteins function in transport. comparatively, 23 % in total of 4tm proteins are involved in receptor activity and 13 % function in enzymatic activity, which is commensurate to the roughly 25 % of receptors and 10 % of enzymes found in the entire membrane proteome. this might suggest that the four-transmembrane topological architecture is more favored for transporting molecules than over other functions.

intriguingly, in our topology analysis we found an important exception to the ubiquitous membrane proteome intracellular locale of the c-terminus in the ngic group that performs dual functions; all  <dig> members have extracellular n- and c-termini. and concomitantly,  <dig> of the  <dig> ngic proteins are predicted to have signal peptides. it has been shown  <cit>  that the prokaryotic 2tm glutamate receptor is an example of where the addition of a cleavable signal peptide can influence the terminal orientations of proteins that originally had a cytoplasmic n-terminus, particularly with proteins with a fewer number of transmembrane helices. the addition of a signal peptide can cause reorientation of the termini ends through causing the translocation of the n-terminus to the outside environment. when the signal peptide is subsequently cleaved, the location of the terminal is in the extracellular region  <cit> . additionally, the ngic family possesses a long  n-terminus tail which contributes to a stably folded ligand binding domain  <cit> . as shown in the 7tm gpcr families, signal peptides are more common in those proteins that contain those two factors, i.e. a long n tail and an n-terminus that engages in stabilizing the ligand binding domain  <cit> . this set of factors regarding the signal peptides and terminal orientations are interesting components that could possibly contribute to the evolution of the ngic topology orientations.

an interesting aspect of the functional classification of the 4tm dataset is that 61 % of the proteins can be described by  <dig> large pfam families or clans, containing a range from  <dig> to  <dig> members. fig.  <dig> depicts the eight clans and domain families and displays the number of proteins within each functional class for each clan or family. furthermore, there are only  <dig> proteins that do not contain any type of conserved functional domain, so up to 97 % of the 4tm dataset contains conserved features that are found in homologous domains within other proteins. as described in the results, some members of these homologous families have been well-studied, however many others have still not been investigated and function is inferred through homology. additionally, this evaluation elucidates six groups  that have uncharacterized functional activity and that share not only conserved sequence features but also a similar 4tm structure . these groups of proteins indicate interesting avenues of future investigation.

overall, we estimate that 58 % of the genes in our 4tm dataset are identified as being involved in various disease conditions and roughly 19 % of the genes are possibly involved in different types of cancer. it is interesting to note that proportionally the transporter class has a higher percentage of genes that are possibly involved in cancer, with 29 % of the proteins in that class identified. in comparison, the miscellaneous and enzyme classes both had 17 % of their proteins identified with cancer. part of this might be accounted for by more research on proteins involved in transport activities. the involvement of 4tm proteins in different types of cancer and other disease conditions point toward the importance of this less explored class of transmembrane proteins and it may be possible to further utilize this class of transmembrane proteins as drug targets.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have functionally classified and manually curated the 4tm complement of the human proteome, which is characterized by four-transmembrane helices and the majority of proteins containing conserved n- and c-termini intracellular location. this examination of the 4tm structural group and related functions shows the ubiquitous transport activity that is unique in a membrane group with such few transmembrane helices. while 4tm proteins are not necessarily identified as classical receptors and transporters, we show they are still heavily involved in these activities as well as cell communication, cell adhesion, and working as scaffolding and structural elements. this has led to perhaps an oversight in pharmacological research efforts. as this detailed characterization of the 4tm dataset and the associated gene-disease information exhibit, these proteins participate in a host of important activities and it is becoming more apparent that they are also involved in various disease conditions including cancer and neurological conditions. further, this dataset highlights particular 4tm proteins that are waiting to be studied in connection to diseases and as possible drug targets.
