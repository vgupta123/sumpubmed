BACKGROUND
the genus populus encompasses approximately  <dig> species divided into  <dig> sections  <cit> . cottonwood species are in the section tacamahaca. the two north american cottonwood species p. balsamifera and p. trichocarpa are so closely related that the latter is often referred to as a subspecies, i.e. populus balsamifera var.trichocarpa  <cit> . in general, gene sequences among the different populus species show high similarity   <cit>  and as close as 99% between p. balsamifera and p. trichocarpa for the few cdnas sequenced in p. balsamifera. in addition to its economic and ecological importance  <cit> , populus was chosen as a model for trees because it has a relatively small genome , just four times the size of the arabidopsis genome. moreover, several genomic tools are available for poplars, such as detailed physical and genetic maps  <cit> , a large number of expressed sequence tags    <cit> . additionally, populus grows rapidly, is easily transformed, regenerated, and propagated vegetatively  <cit> . the first draft of the genome sequence is now complete  <cit>  for populus trichocarpa with nearly 93% of the genome being currently assembled into chromosomes. the 7% non-assembled sequences primarily correspond to heterochromatic regions. the genome sequence for populus trichocarpa facilitates functional analyses of genes in populus as well as comparative and functional genomics with closely related species, especially within the salicaceae.

micrornas  and small interfering rnas  are short  non-coding rna molecules that have been demonstrated to play a key role in the regulation of gene expression  <cit> . in a pattern opposite that of sirnas, which are generated from double-stranded rna, mirnas are transcribed from a long precursor molecule folded upon itself . this precursor molecule is then cleaved by the dicer-like <dig>  protein resulting in a mirna:mirna* complex, which after transport to the cytoplasm separates into the mirna and mirna* units  <cit> . one strand  serve as a guide for the rna-induced silencing complex , which cleave the rna of target genes at the paired region  <cit> . compared to other mechanisms that regulate gene expression, identifying a gene targeted by a mirna is a straightforward process in plants. since the mature mirna and its complementary target sequence have almost perfect complementarily, identifying a mirna usually leads to the prediction and/or identification of its target. mirnas have been shown to target genes that are involved in development, metabolism, stress tolerance, and defense in various plant species  <cit> .

a great deal of effort has gone into identification of mirnas in the two model plants, arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . recently, two thorough analyses of arabidopsis mirnas were published  <cit> . these two studies dramatically increased the number of mirnas identified in arabidopsis from  <dig> to  <dig> families. however, mirna identification in populus has been limited compared to arabidopsis. to date, there has been only one exhaustive study  <cit>  in which  <dig> mirnas expressed primarily in wood development and stress resistance were identified. eleven of these mirnas are conserved in other plant species and ten are absent from arabidopsis. in total,  <dig> mirna families represented by one or a few loci in populus are reported in mirbase  to date. in contrast,  <dig> and  <dig> families were reported for arabidopsis and rice, respectively. moreover, most of the newly identified arabidopsis mirna families  <cit>  are not conserved in populus and rice. a similar situation was found for rice and populus mirnas where  <dig> and  <dig> "species-specific"  families were identified  and a perennial plant , which have different life cycles, different developmental and physiological patterns, as well as different ecological distributions, should help to identify mirnas that have diverged and might be involved in functions specific to annual versus perennial plants.

until recently, most experimental mirna isolation studies involved cloning and capillary sequencing. the concatamerization of srna clones, followed by cloning and cdna isolation from bacteria before sequencing make this approach laborious and costly. moreover, most of the mirnas identified using this approach are highly expressed. the recently introduced  <dig> ultrahigh throughput sequencing technology  <cit>  provides a better alternative. this technology generates millions of bases per run and has been used successfully for sequencing the genomes of bacteria  <cit> , chloroplasts  <cit> , and mitochondria  <cit> , as well as for transcriptome analyses  <cit> . it was also used recently for srna sequencing in arabidopsis and the basal eudicot eschscholzia californica  <cit> . in these studies, the number of mirnas identified in arabidopsis doubled the number previously discovered in total from over  <dig> studies using capillary sequencing. the greater efficiency of discovery, including variants that are expressed at low levels, derives from the much deeper coverage of the srna population provided by pyrosequencing, and avoidance of cloning in the  <dig> system.

here, we used  <dig> pyrosequencing  <cit>  of small rna libraries isolated from leaf and vegetative bud tissues in populus balsamifera. p. balsamifera was chosen for this study because of the local availability of trees for this and future studies, the very close relationship of populus balsamifera and p. trichocarpa  <cit> , the large amount of genetic variation among p. trichocarpa trees  <cit> , and the fact that the p. trichocarpa tree for which the genome sequence was obtained is no longer alive. we identified  <dig> new loci of previously reported mirna families and  <dig> new non-conserved, unique mirna sequences belonging to  <dig> families. we compare the distribution of these mirna sequences in populus with mirna sequences from other land plants and discuss their evolution. targets of these new mirnas were predicted, including genes involved in development, resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and other cellular processes.

RESULTS
srna sequence analysis
pyrosequencing of small rnas from populus leaves and vegetative buds generated  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads respectively. of these,  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequences from leaves and vegetative buds, respectively, were complete, containing the  <dig> nucleotides of both the 5' and 3' adapters. the set of leaf reads included  <dig>  trnas,  <dig>  snornas,  <dig>  chloroplast rrna, and  <dig>  mitochondrial rrna sequences. similar results were obtained for vegetative buds. after removal of these contaminants, a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  srna sequences, with sizes between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides, remained for the leaf and bud samples. by removing redundant sequences from these two data sets, we identified  <dig>   and  <dig>   unique srna sequences from leaf and vegetative buds, respectively. of these, a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique srna sequences matched the populus genome assembly; these were considered for further analysis. srnas of  <dig> nt in length were the most abundant class among the 15â€“ <dig> nucleotide sequences  suggesting that most of the small rnas identified are processed by the populus dcl <dig> homolog. for the two rna samples obtained from vegetative buds and leaves,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique sequences were obtained more than twice.

a small set of mirna families is differentially distributed in arabidopsis, populus and rice
comparison with mirbase  <dig>   <cit>  enabled the identification of  <dig> and  <dig> unique sequences corresponding to annotated poplar mirnas in leaves and vegetative buds, respectively. by removing redundancy due to identical sequences from the two samples we identified  <dig> sequences belonging to  <dig> mirna families . a search for close members from these  <dig> families allowed us to identify  <dig> more members, which increased the number of conserved mirnas identified to  <dig> . most of the populus mirnas reported previously  <cit> , including nine mirnas  reported only in populus, were found in our dataset. several mirnas  that have been shown to be differentially expressed in phloem and xylem development and physical  stress  <cit> , were found in vegetative buds and leaves grown under normal conditions. however, five populus-specific mirnas , including mir <dig>  for which  <dig> members had been previously identified, were not found in our data.

comparative analyses showed that  <dig> mirna families previously annotated from either arabidopsis, rice or physcomitrella were found in our data. all of the  <dig> mirnas conserved between arabidopsis and rice  <cit>  were also found. we also observed mir <dig> and mir <dig> in populus which had previously been reported as arabidopsis-specific  <cit> . these mirnas, along with mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  increase to six the number of mirnas shared by arabidopsis and populus but not found in rice. in contrast, ten mirna families  were shared by arabidopsis and rice but not found in populus. mir <dig> was discovered in physcomitrella  <cit>  but has not yet been found in arabidopsis or rice.

populus conserved mirnas are encoded by large gene families
a query of populus small rnas against mirbase  allowed us to identify  <dig> previously reported families . since it's common for identical mature mirnas to be encoded in multiple paralogous loci in a single genome, we searched for all new loci corresponding to previously identified mirnas. indeed, we were able to map all conserved mirna sequences on the populus genome. their flanking sequences  were retrieved, aligned with populus known hairpin sequences from mirbase  and the alignment checked manually. this analysis showed that, from a total of  <dig> loci identified by sequencing and by in silico analyses in this study,  <dig> correspond to previously reported mirna loci , while  <dig> are new loci. previously un-annotated paralogs were identified for most mirna families, with the exception of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  for families mir156/ <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  the number of members identified in this study was at least twice that reported previously  <cit>  . analysis of the number of members per mirna family showed that most families are expanded in size in populus compared with arabidopsis and rice . seven families  at least doubled in size compared to the numbers previously reported for arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . mir156/ <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> are represented by  <dig> and  <dig> members respectively and three other families  are represented by more than  <dig> members. all of the mirnas identified fulfilled both the phylogenetic conservation and the biogenesis criteria for mirnas   <cit> . thirty-seven new loci also fulfilled the expression criteria and can thus be considered to be bona fide mirnas, while the remaining ones represent mirna candidates for which expression remains to be confirmed.

populus non-conserved mirnas
analysis of sequenced srna using the pipeline described in the materials and methods section identified  <dig> mirna sequences unknown in populus or other plant species. analyses of the secondary structure of genes corresponding to the new mirnas identified  confirmed that they all contain features of mirnas previously described by  <cit> . forty of the mirnas  were represented by more than  <dig> sequence reads in the srna data set from leaves and vegetative buds, and/or their expression has been confirmed by northern hybridization. these are thus considered as bona fide mirnas by the accepted criteria of  <cit>  . twenty-one sequences represented by less than two counts in the srna data set were considered as mirna candidates. comparison and distribution of the  <dig> mirna sequences showed that they belong to  <dig> families . an exact mirna* or a close length variant was observed for  <dig> of these  <dig> families . the number of mirnas identified in this study represents almost twice the number of mirna families previously reported in populus , which can now be increased to  <dig> families. most of these mirnas, including ones that are not highly expressed, start with the nucleotide "u"  indicating these mirnas have the same biogenesis origin as the conserved ones. the number of loci in each family and their chromosome locations are indicated in table  <dig> . about the same number of conserved mirna sequences were found in vegetative buds  as in leaves  . however less than half  of the non-conserved mirna sequences were found in both leaves and vegetative buds .

the length  of each mirna, the number of loci , the number of times a sequence was sampled in leaf  and vegetative buds , and whether or not a mirna star  was observed are indicated.  indicate mirnas for which the expression was confirmed by northern hybridization.  indicate mirna candidates.

relative expression of the non-conserved mirnas varied widely, based on the number of sequences observed for each mirna in our dataset. the three  most highly expressed mirnas  were represented by more than  <dig> sequences in leaves, and 48â€“ <dig> times in vegetative buds. nine  of the non-conserved mirna families were present between  <dig> and  <dig> times, while the remaining  <dig> mirna families had lower levels of expression. approximately 34% of non-conserved mirna families were represented by more than  <dig> sequences in our dataset, of which six mirnas  were expressed relatively highly in leaves  while only two were observed at those levels in vegetative buds . to validate the sequencing results, the expression was confirmed for  <dig> arbitrarily chosen genes representing 9% of these families by northern hybridization .

target search of non-conserved mirnas
in order to predict potential regulatory targets of non-conserved mirnas, a search was performed on the tigr populus cdna dataset as described in the methods section. for  <dig>  of the non-conserved mirna families, no putative target could be predicted on populus cdss and cdnas. in total, putative targets were predicted for  <dig>  of the non-conserved mirna families . we used the highest scoring arabidopsis blastp hit to annotate the putative functional category of the predicted target genes . for  <dig>  mirna families, the target search allowed populus unigenes that have no homology to known arabidopsis sequences to be identified. twenty-six  of the non-conserved mirnas had a best alignment to arabidopsis sequences, of which two predicted target genes were annotated only as expressed sequences. eleven  mirna families have more than one predicted target,  <dig> of which have more than  <dig> predicted targets. approximately 13% of the target genes predicted  encode transcription factor proteins involved in various processes of plant development such as myb, homeodomain-leucine zipper, anac , and no apical meristem . predicted target genes that encode for transcription factors and dna and rna binding represented 13% of the mirnas. several other predicted targets include genes involved in resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses such as cc-nbs-lrr, tir-nbs-lrr, calmodulin-binding protein, cyclic nucleotide-gated channel c, as well as trypsin and protease inhibitor family proteins . three mirnas predicted target genes encoding polyphenol oxidase, which belongs to the lignin synthesis pathway. another predicted target gene encodes dihydroquinate dehydratase protein in the shikimate pathway. targets involved in other cellular and developmental processes, such as transport, were also identified .

"-" indicates that no target was found in populus. "no" indicates that no arabidopsis homolog of the populus target was found. other target were found for some mirnas, but they have no significant similarity either to arabidopsis  or other plant  protein sequences.

discussion
populus contains at least  <dig> mirna families
previous studies  <cit>  identified  <dig> mirna families  in populus. in this study,  <dig> conserved mirna loci belonging to  <dig> families and  <dig> non-conserved mirna loci representing  <dig> new families were also identified. moreover,  <dig> mirna candidates belonging to  <dig> families were identified. this increased the number of mirnas identified in populus by almost 200%. among the newly identified mirnas,  <dig> correspond to new loci of previously identified mirna families  <cit> . the other  <dig> mirna families showed no sequence conservation with mirnas from arabidopsis, rice, or other plant sequences in mirbase. some of these non-conserved sequences may have resulted from sequencing errors  <cit> , but almost all  of them were captured repeatedly. moreover, rarely did these variants contain mononucleotide runs that are the expected source of most  <dig> errors  <cit> . furthermore, because we analyzed only those sequences that exactly matched the populus genome, most reads with sequencing errors would have been removed and not considered as mirnas in this study. the sequences generated, both conserved and non-conserved, increased the total number of mirna families in populus by  <dig> families. because many members of these  <dig> mirna families were identified by genome-scale data mining and sequencing, it is possible that most of the mirnas in populus have now been discovered. however, because we used 100% homology to the p. trichocarpa genome sequence to identify mirnas, there may be additional mirnas in p. balsamifera that we missed due to slight sequence divergence from p. trichocarpa. indeed, the sequences of the very few p. balsamifera ests in genbank differ from p. trichocarpa in the  <dig> â€“ 2% range , including possible sequencing errors. also, the fact that that some mirnas were observed only twice indicates that even deeper sequencing might still capture new mirnas. deeper sequencing is also likely to isolate more mirna* sequences for the newly identified mirnas, as mirna* was identified for only six of the non-conserved mirnas. the low number of mirna* identified is probably due to non-saturating coverage of the small rna libraries. also, sampling of other tissues at different developmental stages, or in response to physiological conditions, may result in the identification of new non-conserved mirna families, their corresponding members, and mirna* sequences.

in summary, the composition of the mirna pool in populus seems to be similar to that in arabidopsis and rice, though they differ substantially in family number and in the occurrence of many lineage specific mirnas. indeed, populus, arabidopsis, and rice contain  <dig> conserved families as well as large sets of non-conserved mirnas. the identification of such a large number of mirnas from populus represents a key resource for comparative and functional analyses of mirnas as well as the study of their evolution.

differential conservation of mirnas between populus, arabidopsis and rice
all  <dig> families conserved between arabidopsis, populus and rice  <cit>  were identified in our dataset. the conservation of this set of mirna families in such taxonomically divergent land plant species  indicates these mirnas are subject to functional constraints which keep them highly conserved across species. however, a small set of mirnas seems to be differentially distributed in arabidopsis, populus and rice. we found  <dig> arabidopsis  and one physcomitrella  mirna families that were not previously reported in populus. this extends the number of conserved mirnas between arabidopsis and populus to  <dig> families. furthermore,  <dig> arabidopsis mirna families  which have been reported as conserved between arabidopsis and rice were not found in our sequence data. these sequences can not be identified in the populus genome and cdna databases either, even under relaxed alignment parameters. this indicates that the conservation of some mirnas between species is not only associated with the phylogenetic distance between the species but may also be under the control of other undetermined constraint.

organization and evolution of populus mirnas
comparison of the numbers of paralogous mirna loci per family in arabidopsis, populus and rice indicate that most conserved mirna families have different numbers of paralogs in the different lineages. the number of loci per mirna family is generally higher in populus compared to arabidopsis and rice. several arabidopsis and rice families such as mir156/ <dig>  mir159/ <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> are nearly double in size in populus. this result is not in accord with an initial report  <cit>  that the mirna gene family size is similar between the three model species . more mirna gene duplicates appear to be retained in populus in parallel with the greater number of genes that have been maintained since the last genome duplication . this increase in mirna family size is probably not be due to a difference in the level of genome duplication alone, however, since both arabidopsis and populus have extensive genome sequence duplication  <cit>  and the arabidopsis and rice genomes appear to have changed much faster relative to populus in the time since their last common ancestor  <cit> . an alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in the selection pressure on duplicated mirnas in populus and that having more mirna members might be advantageous for adaptation to perennial growth and to different ecological environments.

most of the newly identified populus mirna families are not conserved
most  of the arabidopsis mirnas and mirna candidates reported in recent studies  <cit>  were not found in our populus data. thirty of the rice mirna families are not found in either arabidopsis or populus . similarly, most of our non-conserved newly identified mirna families appear to be specific to populus at this point. the mirnas found only in populus to date could be relatively young, generated by recent duplication events specific to populus  <cit> . the identification of a large set of mirnas specific to each species supports the hypothesis that most lineage-specific mirnas are generated by recent duplication events or other processes specific to species or clades  <cit> . an alternative possibility is that they may actually be ancient mirnas that have been under positive selection and divergence in populus but have lost function in arabidopsis. depending on the age of the duplication and how strong the selection pressure is, the number of functional mirnas may vary between species. in this study, at least one target was predicted for most of the non-conserved mirnas identified, indicating that they may be functional. however, it has been shown in a previous report  <cit>  that target genes could not be validated for most of the apparently arabidopsis-specific mirnas, even though they have a high degree of similarity with known genes. therefore, only an experimental validation of predicted targets will allow newly identified mirnas to be confirmed as functional, and to determine if the hypothesis proposed by  <cit>  is generally valid. furthermore, mirna studies in additional non-model plant species are required to determine the extent to which non-conserved mirnas identified to date are truly species- specific or appear in other lineages.

the non-conserved mirnas potentially regulate a wide variety of functions including many genes that are specific to populus
an important question raised by the large number of non-conserved mirnas found in populus is the function of genes targeted by these mirnas. prediction of gene targets using annotated populus cdnas showed that nearly 65% of the newly identified non-conserved mirnas have targets. the remaining 35% could correspond to genes that are not identified using automatic annotation or lowly expressed genes that are not yet represented in populus cdna and est datasets. alternately, some of these mirnas may have different modes of target recognition  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  30% of the genes targeted by non-conserved mirnas have no best hit in arabidopsis indicating that these genes could be populus specific, or at least diverged in arabidopsis. this important discovery suggests that non-conserved mirnas are involved in the regulation of cellular, physiological or developmental processes in a manner that is specific to these species. nine  of annotated genes targeted by non-conserved mirnas are transcription factors or nucleic acid binding proteins, all of which have been previously reported in arabidopsis  <cit> . these transcription factors include ap <dig>  myb, squamosa, homeobox-leucine zipper, and no apical meristem . another class of highly represented non-conserved mirnas predicted targets in populus are genes involved in plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. the most common are cc-nbs-lrr genes and tir-nbs-lrr resistance genes. this class represents the most frequently cloned resistance genes to date, which play an important role in the detection of various pathogens  <cit> . other resistance gene predicted targets included hypersensitive-induced response protein  involved in plant defense against biotrophic pathogens  <cit> , trypsin and protease inhibitor family protein  as well as polyphenol oxidases that are involved in plant defense against herbivores and other stresses  <cit> . moreover, several housekeeping genes are predicted to be targeted by the new non-conserved mirnas.

to check if conserved and non-conserved mirnas from populus target genes with similar function, we compared the biological functions of their potential target genes . these analyses showed that conserved and non-conserved mirnas from populus target genes are involved in the same biological processes. however, non-conserved mirnas have twice as many putative target genes encoding transcription factors, transporters, protein binding genes, and nucleic acids binding genes as conserved mirnas. a statistical analysis using the gostat program  <cit>  confirmed the bias of non-conserved mirnas towards genes involved in two biological processes . moreover, since a third of the non-conserved mirna predicted targets had no homologs in arabidopsis, no definitive conclusions could be drawn about the divergence of target genes between these two classes of mirnas. to test if conserved and non-conserved mirnas from populus and arabidopsis target genes similarly, we compared the biological functions of their predicted target genes . if this hypothesis is true, mirna targets should reflect the diversity of the populus transcriptome. our analyses showed that mirna putative targets from arabidopsis and populus present similar patterns in that they were both biased toward development, transcription, dna and rna metabolism, protein metabolism, electron transport and signal transduction. the over-representation of these biological processes was confirmed with the gostat program  <cit>  . this indicates that conserved and non-conserved mirnas from both species are subject to similar selection pressures allowing mirnas that regulate some biological processes to be retained.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, pyrosequencing of uncloned srna permitted us to make the following discoveries:  most members of previously reported mirna families are also found in populus leaves and buds;  forty eight new mirnas were identified that may be populus specific;  mirna families are larger in size in populus than in arabidopsis and rice;  about a third of the genes targeted by non-conserved mirnas appear to be populus-specific;  as in rice and arabidopsis, populus mirnas primarily target genes that regulate development and that are involved in stress responses;  non-conserved and conserved mirnas target genes involved in similar biological processes; and  the targets of conserved and non-conserved mirnas are biased towards development, transcription, dna and rna binding, electron transport and signal transduction.
