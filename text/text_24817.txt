BACKGROUND
woody plants constitute one of the most important economic and ecological resources on earth. the forest ecosystems play an important role in the production of the world’s biomass. therefore, they are a necessary factor that must be considered when addressing climate change and the maintenance of biological diversity. trees are an inestimable resource in various industries such as wood, pulp, paper, biofuel and other useful material of commercial importance  <cit> . the molecular biology of trees is a field that is experiencing extraordinary advances especially because different genomic and transcriptomic projects are providing a huge amount of valuable information to understand the molecular basis underlying the physiological regulation of gene expression.

nitrogen metabolism is a fundamental area of research in plant biology. nitrogen, a constitutive element of amino acids and nucleotides, is a limiting factor in the growth and development of land plants and constitutes a true challenge for their survival  <cit> . terrestrial plants have evolved metabolic pathways to assimilate and distribute nitrogen for the biosynthesis of a wide range of molecules. nitrogen is both essential and limiting, and plants have developed systems to guarantee its economy such as the glutamine synthetase /glutamate synthase  cycle  <cit> . the enzyme gs  synthesizes glutamine incorporating ammonium to glutamate in the presence of atp, while gogat  generates glutamate by transferring the amide group of glutamine to α-ketoglutarate. the amino acids glutamine and glutamate are the main nitrogen donors for the biosynthesis of a wide variety of nitrogenous compounds. x-ray crystallography of maize zmgs1a  <cit>  and medicago mtgs1a  <cit>  demonstrated that plant gs is a decameric enzyme. the protein is composed of two face-to-face pentameric rings with active sites located at the interfaces between the n-terminal and c-terminal domains of two neighboring subunits within a pentameric ring, which results in a total of  <dig> active sites per gs decamer  <cit> .

plants have also developed systems for ammonium reassimilation from secondary sources to avoid losing biological nitrogen. during photorespiration the mitochondrial decarboxylation of glycine generate important quantities of ammonium, which are then incorporated to carbon skeletons in the chloroplast through the gs/gogat cycle  <cit> . these metabolic activities are combined because of the strict spatial association of mitochondria, peroxisome and chloroplast, and because they prevent the toxic accumulation of ammonium and nitrogen loss  <cit> . even though lignin, a polymeric compound especially important in woody plants, does not contain nitrogen, phenylalanine metabolism is required to channel photosynthesis-derived carbon to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. the ammonium released in the reaction catalyzed by phenylalanine ammonia lyase is recycled by the gs/gogat cycle, which allows it to be reincorporated into the continuous synthesis of phenylalanine, and consequently lignin and other phenolic compounds  <cit> . furthermore, gs is also expressed in different physiological situations such as pathogen attack  <cit>  or senescence  <cit> .

in plants, cytosolic  and chloroplastic  glutamine synthetase isoenzymes have been identified and are found in different intracellular locations that are related to their specialized roles. the chloroplastic gs <dig> is coded by a single gene in most plant species and has been detected in photosynthetic tissues where it assimilates the ammonium released from photorespiration or nitrate/nitrite reduction  <cit> . conversely, gs <dig> is coded by a small gene family which varies in number among species, and the different isoenzymes are found in different types of cells and tissues according to their different physiological functions  <cit> . gs <dig> is mainly found in heterotrophic organs such as roots, seeds, stems, nodules, flowers and fruits, where it assimilates the ammonium from the soil, lignin biosynthesis, stress and senescence  <cit> .

in a previous study  <cit> , it was reported that the gs gene family in poplar is organized into  <dig> groups of duplicated genes,  <dig> of which code for cytosolic gs isoforms  and  <dig> that codes for the chloroplastic gs isoform . our previous findings suggested that the gs duplicates may have been retained to increase the amount of enzyme in particular cell types.

the aim of the current study was to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular structure, biochemical properties, and kinetic parameters of gs isoenzymes and to evaluate the cell- and tissue-specific spatial expression of the individual members of the gs gene family in poplar. the molecular and functional analysis of the gs family and the precise locations of the corresponding mrna strongly support that gs isoforms play non-redundant roles in poplar tree biology. our results also support the proposal that the function of the duplicated genes in specific cell types is to increase the abundance of the enzymes. therefore, while there is no redundancy in the poplar gs family at the plant level, redundancy does exist in specific cell types that express two duplicated genes. this gene redundancy may contribute to maintaining the homeostasis of nitrogen metabolism during processes associated with the changes in glutamine use in multiple metabolic pathways.

RESULTS
expression of active poplar gs isoforms
the poplar genome contains  <dig> groups of duplicated genes of gs named gs <dig> , gs <dig> , gs <dig>  and gs <dig>  which are expressed in different organs of the tree  <cit> . total intact rna was isolated from populus trichocarpa clone inra 101– <dig> and full-length cdna  representatives of gs genes were isolated by rt-pcr using specific primers . the identity of gs cdnas was confirmed by sequencing analysis and the corresponding data are presented in additional file  <dig>  constructs of his-tag fusion proteins for gs <dig>  , gs <dig>  , gs <dig>  , gs <dig>  were expressed in escherichia coli . all poplar gs isoforms were active in bacteria and the specific activities observed varied among the different isoforms, with higher values for gs <dig> isoforms than for gs <dig> . the western blot analysis of the bacterial protein extracts demonstrated a parallel accumulation of plant gs polypeptides . poplar gs <dig> , gs <dig> , gs <dig>  and gs <dig> holoenzymes were purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography . these highly purified enzyme preparations were used for molecular and kinetic analysis.figure  <dig>

the molecular sizes of the poplar gs holoenzymes were determined by gel filtration chromatography through a calibrated column with proteins standards . the gs <dig> holoenzyme was observed to be 454 kda and the estimated sizes of the gs <dig> holoenzymes ranged from  <dig> to 415 kda. considering the sizes of the poplar gs polypeptides determined by mass spectrometry , the resulting values for the gs holoenzymes are compatible with a decameric structure of the enzyme oligomer.figure  <dig>

catalytic properties of poplar gs isoenzymes
we were interested in determining whether poplar gs holoenzymes differ in their kinetic parameters against substrates because this finding would support their potentially different metabolic roles. the kinetic properties were determined by assaying the biosynthetic gs activity and the most significant results are presented in table  <dig>  the poplar isoforms did not differ in their affinity for atp but did demonstrate contrasting kinetic behaviors for ammonium and glutamate. the gs <dig> , gs <dig>  and gs <dig>  enzymes had responses to changes in the concentrations of glutamate which did not follow hyperbolic saturation. the kinetic data were further analyzed using lineweaver-burk and hill plots which indicated the existence of negative cooperativity . in contrast, gs <dig> demonstrated a typical michaelis-menten saturation curve for glutamate with a km value of 26 mm and sigmoidal kinetics against ammonium with calculated parameters of nh =  <dig> ; s <dig>  =  <dig> . the kinetic analysis also revealed that the poplar cytosolic isoforms of gs exhibited a high affinity for ammonium, particularly gs <dig>  with an extremely low km value . because the final preparations of the enzymes were homogenous and the molecular masses were previously determined , it was possible to determine the corresponding catalytic  and specificity constants  for ammonium and are also presented in table  <dig>  the specificity constant for gs <dig>   is within a range that is typical of a very efficient catalytic and specific enzyme  <cit> . in a previous paper  <cit>  we proposed that duplicated genes in poplar may play redundant roles in nitrogen metabolism. if this hypothesis is correct the isoforms encoded by the duplicated genes should have similar metabolic roles, and consequently similar kinetics. to test this hypothesis we recombinantly expressed and characterized the enzymes encoded by the ptgs <dig>  duplicated genes . the observed kinetic parameters for both expression products were nearly identical .table  <dig>

optimal temperature and ph of poplar gs enzymes
the effect of temperature on the activity of the recombinant gs isoforms was examined . the profiles of the three cytosolic isoforms were quite similar with sustained increases in enzyme activity in response to increases in temperature until a maximum level was reached. however, the profile for gs <dig> did not demonstrate similar sustained increases in gs activity. the following activation energies were calculated for the cytosolic and chloroplastic gs isoforms: − <dig>  kj mol− <dig> for gs <dig> , − <dig>  kj mol− <dig> for gs <dig> , − <dig>  kj mol− <dig> for gs <dig>  and − <dig>  kj mol− <dig> for gs <dig> . consistent with the observed profiles, similar values were found for gs <dig> , gs <dig>  and gs <dig> , and gs <dig> exhibited much higher activation energy. gs <dig>  and gs <dig>  demonstrated maximal activity at 50°c. in contrast, the optimal temperature for gs <dig>  was 37°c, which is similar to the observed value for gs <dig>  poplar gs isoforms were active at a wide range of ph levels, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the cytosolic enzymes gs <dig>  and gs <dig>  demonstrated maximal activity at a ph  <dig> - <dig>  in contrast, the optimal ph for gs <dig>  and the gs <dig> was  <dig> .figure  <dig>

stability of poplar gs isoforms
to further examine the differences in the poplar isoforms as molecular catalysts the heat stabilities of gs <dig> , gs <dig> , gs <dig>  and gs <dig> were examined . all enzymes were stable at 37°c, the temperature of the enzymatic assay. the cytosolic enzymes gs <dig>  and gs <dig>  exhibited a certain degree of thermal stability. they retained more than 50% of their activity when incubated at 42°c and were immediately inactivated at higher temperatures. in contrast, gs <dig>  was extremely sensitive to heat, even more sensitive than gs <dig>  and retained only 20% of its activity after 5 min of incubation at 42°c.figure  <dig>

oxidation catalyzed by metals can be used as an indicator of the structural stability of gs enzymes  <cit> . therefore, we further examined the tolerance of poplar gs isoforms to metal-mixed oxidation . as observed for temperature stability, gs <dig>  was completely inactived after 180 min of metal-oxidation exposure. in contrast, gs <dig>  and gs <dig>  were much more tolerant and retained more than 50% of their initial activity level after 240 min of treatment. in this context, it is interesting that the chloroplastic isoform  was also sensitive to metal-oxidation .

localization of poplar gs transcripts in different cell types
the precise distribution of the gs transcripts in the different cell types of the leaves, stems and roots of poplar was examined by in situ hybridization  using specific probes . the specific labeling for ptgs <dig> transcripts was observed in the lamina, external phloem and parenchyma cells of leaves . a magnified view of a leaf blade hybridized with the antisense probe reveals that ptgs <dig> mrna is localized in spongy and palisade cells and that there is a lack of labeling in the lower and upper epidermis . a similar expression pattern was also observed for the ptgs <dig>  transcripts with enhanced signals in the leaf blade . ptgs <dig>  mrna was highly abundant in the vascular bundles of stems . a strong labeling was observed in phloem cells . ptgs <dig>  transcripts were localized in the cells of the root vascular cylinder . the specificity of the ish was confirmed by an absence of signal in the target tissues probed with the sense probes for ptgs <dig> , ptgs <dig>  , ptgs <dig>   and ptgs <dig>  . in a previous paper  <cit>  we proposed that duplicated genes expressed in the same cell types of poplar may play redundant roles in nitrogen metabolism. to test this hypothesis, we performed simultaneous ish analyses of the two duplicate ptgs <dig>  genes , and the results obtained revealed that these genes displayed identical spatial expression patterns.figure  <dig>

ish is a powerful technique for studying the spatial expression patterns of genes in plants but the ability to reliably quantify gene expression levels by ish is quite limited. we were interested in comparing the relative expression levels of each pair of duplicated poplar genes in the specific cell types to complement the results from the ish analyses and to investigate the roles of the gs family members in poplar ammonium assimilation. to overcome this limitation, we have developed protocols for the laser capture microdissection  of poplar tissue sections. total rna was isolated from lcm samples, and the expression levels of the entire gs gene family were analyzed by real-time qpcr . the maximum level of ptgs <dig>  expression was observed in the leaf lamina and a decreased level was observed in the parenchyma cells of the leaf . transcripts for ptgs <dig>  duplicates were also found at lower abundance in the phloem cells and cortical parenchyma of the stems . ptgs <dig>  transcripts were exclusively detected in the vascular cylinder of the root . ptgs <dig>  demonstrated the highest levels of gene expression in the lcm samples taken from the leaf and stem and was only detected at low levels in the root . in the leaf, ptgs <dig>  transcripts were exclusively detected in the vascular bundles, but in the stem, ptgs <dig>  transcripts were abundant in all of the cell types examined, with higher levels in the phloem and xylem . a maximum level of ptgs <dig> expression was observed in the parenchyma cells of the leaf with a lower level observed in the vascular bundles . decreased levels of ptgs <dig> transcripts were also found in the pith and cortical parenchyma of the stems . similar levels of ptgs <dig> transcripts were also detected in the cortical parenchyma of the root, where a high abundance of amyloplasts was evident . it is interesting that the expression profiles of ptgs <dig>  and ptgs <dig> in the leaf were complementary with maximum expression levels of ptgs <dig>  in the lamina and maximum expression levels of ptgs <dig> in parenchyma cells.figure  <dig>

nitrogen regulation of poplar gs expression
to further investigate the functional properties of gs <dig>  in the poplar leaves the expression patterns of the entire gene family of duplicated genes were examined under conditions of adequate  and low  nitrate availability. as table  <dig> shows, ptgs <dig>  was predominantly expressed in both young and mature leaves at low nitrogen. interestingly, the ptgs <dig>  transcripts were particularly abundant in the young leaves. under conditions of adequate nitrogen nutrition, ptgs <dig> transcripts were the most abundant in young leaves, and ptgs <dig>  was the predominant gene expressed in mature leaves.table  <dig>

discussion
the evolution of gene families for enzymes should be considered in the context of the metabolic and regulatory networks of the organism and the environment it inhabits.

in poplar, the gs gene family consists of  <dig> groups of duplicated genes for gs <dig>  and  <dig> duplicated gene for gs <dig>  <cit> . a microsynteny analysis of the genomic regions where the gs genes are located suggested that the origin of the duplicated genes was a whole genome-wide duplication  event that occurred approximately  <dig> millions year ago and is still detectable over approximately 92% of the poplar genome  <cit> . the structure of each pair of populus duplicated gs genes is well conserved in both the coding and regulatory regions, and they demonstrate identical spatial and seasonal gene expression patterns  <cit> .

in the first part of this study, we isolated populus trichocarpa gs flcdna, produced recombinant poplar isoenzymes in bacteria, and conducted a comparative analysis of their structural and kinetic properties. the aim was to highlight the physiological roles of each isoenzyme according to the previously determined differential expression profile of the duplicated gs genes. the flcdna for gs <dig>  , gs <dig>  , gs <dig>   and gs <dig>  were expressed in e. coli to overproduce recombinant isoenzymes. all poplar gs isoforms were active in bacteria, which is consistent with results previously described for other gs holoenzymes  <cit> , and the observed specific activity levels varied among the different isoforms, with much higher values for the gs <dig> isoforms than for gs <dig> . note that for gs <dig> , both of the duplicated genes were produced in e. coli for a detailed evaluation of the molecular and kinetic characteristics of both expression products. this analysis was of particular interest considering that isoforms catalyzing the same metabolic reaction are present in the same cell types.

the amounts of available recombinant proteins were sufficient for estimating the molecular sizes of holoenzymes and accurately determining the molecular masses of the poplar gs polypeptides by mass spectrometry analysis. the resulting values  are compatible with a decameric structure of the enzyme oligomer, which was previously reported for the cytosolic gs holoenzymes in maize  <cit>  and medicago  <cit> . the recombinant expression of poplar gs genes also provided a good source of unlimited amounts of the isoenzymes for the comparative analysis of their biochemical properties. the cytosolic enzymes gs <dig>  and gs <dig>  exhibited maximal activity levels at high temperatures  and slightly acidic ph . in contrast, the optimal temperature and ph for gs <dig>  activity was much lower and closer to gs <dig>  in regard to stability, the cytosolic enzymes gs <dig>  and gs <dig>  were much more tolerant to thermal inactivation and metal-catalyzed oxidation than gs <dig> . again, the biochemical behavior of gs <dig>  was similar to gs <dig>  previous studies have reported that cytosolic are generally more stable proteins than chloroplastic isoenzymes  <cit> . taken together these results indicate that gs <dig>  differs from the other poplar cytosolic gs exhibiting an unusually low conformational stability, which is a molecular feature usually characteristic of chloroplastic isoenzymes. it is tempting to speculate that this finding may be related to the possible roles of gs in different environmental conditions or developmental stages.

to understand the correlation between the molecular characteristics and physiological functions, the catalytic properties of the enzymes were examined. according to the kinetic data , the turnover number is much smaller for gs <dig> than for gs <dig> isoenzymes, which implies that it has a slower production rate of glutamine. the specific positive cooperativity of gs <dig> for ammonium, however, demonstrates that this enzyme is able to rapidly respond to changes in the ammonium availability in the plastid. cytosolic gs exhibited negative cooperativity for glutamate as previously observed for the pine gs1b enzyme  <cit> . this kinetic behavior serves to insulate an enzyme from the effects of changes in substrate concentration  <cit> . consequently, gs <dig> , gs <dig>  and gs <dig>  would provide a constant flux of glutamine independently of fluctuations in the celular levels of glutamate. overall, poplar cytosolic enzymes exhibited similar kinetic characteristics except in their ammonium affinity. studies in arabidopsis thaliana have shown that the presence of glutamine at residue  <dig> and serine at residue  <dig> is related to the high affinity ammonium properties of two gs <dig> isozymes and that the presence of lysine and alanine in equivalent positions were found in the low affinity gs <dig> enzymes  <cit> . based on these findings, it has been thought that the presence or absence of these residues in the primary structure of the polypeptides may be indicative of the relative ammonium affinity of gs <dig>  for example, in the barley gs family, hvgs1_ <dig> has been proposed to be a low affinity isozyme because it lacks both of these residues and would therefore require a greater concentration of ammonia for maximal activity compared with hvgs1_ <dig> and hvgs1_ <dig>  <cit> . differences have also been suggested in the ammonium affinity properties of the gs <dig> large family of brassica napus because of the presence of these two polar residues at conserved positions  <cit> . poplar gs <dig>  exhibits an extremely high affinity for ammonium even though it contains lysine and alanine residues at positions that are equivalent to the positions in arabidopsis isoenzymes. furthermore, a low-affinity gs <dig> isoform expressed in sorghum roots has a glutamine residue at position  <dig>  <cit> . based on these results, we conclude that the determinant residues of ammonium affinity vary from one gs <dig> to another depending on the plants species.

to further understand the function of poplar gs genes, the precise gene expression patterns were determined by in situ hybridization and laser-capture microdisection analyses. ptgs <dig> transcripts were mainly localized in the lamina and parenchyma cells of leaves and found at much lower level in the vascular bundles , which suggest that it plays an essential role in nitrogen metabolism associated with photosynthetic activity  <cit> . interestingly, the highest levels of the transcripts for ptgs <dig>  duplicates were also observed in the leaf lamina, with decreased levels observed in the parenchyma cells . these results suggest that ptgs <dig>  plays a relevant role in the photosynthetic metabolism of the leaf likely complementing the role of ptgs <dig>  indeed, ptgs <dig>  transcripts were highly abundant in young and mature leaves with low nitrogen, which suggests that the gs <dig>  isoform with a high affinity for ammonium plays an important role under these metabolic conditions. osgln1; <dig>  the predominant isoform in rice leaves  <cit> , is mainly involved in the remobilization of nitrogen released during senescence. in contrast, the predominant gs <dig> isoform in poplar leaves, ptgs <dig> , does not appear to be involved in senescence. when poplar leaves were infected with the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae, the relative abundance of ptgs <dig>  ptgs <dig> , and especially ptgs <dig>  transcripts decreased considerably, which most likely reflects the impact of pathogen attack. in contrast, the levels of ptgs <dig>  transcripts increased dramatically and were greater than  <dig> times the levels observed in non-infected leaves . these results are consistent with the enhanced expression of ptgs <dig>  observed in senescent poplar leaves  <cit>  and suggest an essential role for the gs <dig>  isoform in nitrogen remobilization. under conditions of vegetative growth, however, ptgs <dig>  transcripts were almost exclusively expressed in roots, especially in the secondary roots. ptgs <dig>  transcripts were localized in the cells of the root vascular cylinder , suggesting that gs <dig>  is the principal isoform involved in the primary assimilation of nitrogen from soil. transcripts for the ptgs <dig>  duplicates were highly expressed in the vascular bundles of leaves and stems  but were also present at lower levels in the vascular elements of the roots . this specific localization and the particular abundance of ptgs <dig>  in phloem and xylem cells of the stems suggest that the enzyme plays an essential role in generating glutamine and asparagine for nitrogen transport  <cit>  and in the reassimilation of ammonium released in phenylalanine metabolism  <cit> .

in a previous study  <cit> , we proposed that duplicated genes in poplar may play redundant roles in the nitrogen metabolism of specific cell-types. the analysis of the recombinant isoenzymes encoded by the duplicates ptgs <dig> - <dig> and ptgs <dig> - <dig> revealed that they exhibit nearly identical kinetic parameters. these findings strongly suggest that the poplar gs duplicates encode isoenzymes functionally equivalent. it was also of interest to determine whether the duplicated genes displayed identical gene expression patterns. the in situ hybridization analysis of transcripts for the ptgs <dig>  duplicates  strongly support that poplar gene duplicates are expressed in the same cell-types. furthermore, the gene expression studies of the duplicated genes in laser microdissected samples from leaves, stems and roots fully support this hypothesis that is consistent with the presence of conserved regulatory elements in the promoters of each pair of genes  <cit> . similar results were recently reported for gs genes in brassica napus, in which most of the homologous duplicated genes displayed similar expression patterns in different tissues  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the previously reported gene expression analysis of the entire gs family  <cit> , the molecular and functional analysis of the recombinant gs isoenzymes, and the precise locations of the corresponding mrna in different cell types reported in this study strongly suggest that the poplar gs isoforms play non-redundant roles in tree biology. furthermore, all these studies further support the proposal that the expression of the duplicated genes in specific cell types serves to increase the abundance of the enzymes. therefore, while there is no redundancy in the poplar gs family at the whole plant level, it clearly exists in specific cell types that express the two duplicated genes. the preservation of duplicated genes involved in central pathways may be related to the high enzyme copy number needed to maintain metabolic flux  <cit> . consequently, gs gene redundancy may contribute to maintaining the homeostasis of nitrogen metabolism during processes associated with the changes in glutamine use in multiple metabolic pathways.

genome duplications are usually followed by a massive gene loss in which some of the duplicated genes are retained and evolve to new functions  <cit> . alternatively, duplicated genes can remain largely redundant and serve to increase the abundance of encoded proteins, or the redundancy could also be related to enhanced robustness against mutations  <cit> . functionally, the redundancy in the poplar gs family that appeared after the last wgd most likely favoured the adaptation of poplar trees to faster growth and new ecological niches. this proposal is supported by the increase in growth observed in transgenic poplars overexpressing constitutively a pine gs gene  <cit> . furthermore, enhanced gs expression in poplar resulted in an enhanced efficiency in nitrogen assimilation and stress tolerance  <cit> . all these data indicate that increased levels of gs confer selective metabolic advantages in poplar trees. whereas massive gene loss occurred in the gs gene family of brassica napus  <cit>  following a whole-genome triplication event after divergence from arabidopsis, all of the duplicated genes were retained in populus after the last wgd, and these paralogous genes conserved their expression profiles with no apparent signs of neofunctionalization.
