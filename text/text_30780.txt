BACKGROUND
isophya and poecilimon represent the most evolutionarily successful genera of the tribe barbitistini , accounting for about 82% species of this taxon. both genera represent herbivorous short-winged bushcrickets with complex acoustic behavior  <cit> . their center of diversification and, possibly, origin, is the pontic region, and especially anatolia, which is home to a vast number of taxa  with restricted ranges  <cit> . a great number of taxa are local endemics; nevertheless, they often occur in huge numbers and thus may damage crops  <cit> .

several attempts to classify these two groups have been made, mainly on a smaller scale  and using various approaches, such as morphology  <cit> , bioacoustic and morphological traits  <cit> , cytogenetic data  <cit> , and molecular phylogenies  <cit> . yet, many questions and doubts remain unanswered due to the large number of taxa, the vast recent radiation in some lineages and, possibly, the considerable contribution of present and past hybridization events  <cit> .

ribosomal dna genes  and active nucleolus organizer regions  are very useful chromosome markers for interspecific comparisons. over the last few years, fluorescence in situ hybridization  techniques have been extensively used for understanding the karyotype structure and evolution of various insects, especially coleopterans , lepidopterans  <cit> , and orthopterans   <cit> . in other orthoptera, e.g. tettigoniids, repeated dna has been analyzed by silver impregnation  and chromosomal mapping with a view to location of the major ribosomal dna cluster  and telomere repeats 
n
 in the subfamilies saginae  <cit> , bradyporinae  <cit> , and phaneropterinae  <cit> .

to date, the chromosomal organization  of barbitistini was analyzed in species belonging to eight genera of this tribe. in these lineages the latter markers proved to be good for understanding genomic differentiation and distinguishing between species and evolutionary lines  <cit> . in this work, we present a detailed cytogenetic analysis of  <dig> taxa belonging to the genera poecilimon and isophya. we examined their chromosomal characteristics, the number and distribution of major rdna clusters using fish with an 18s rdna probe, and active nor locations by silver staining. in fish experiments, we also used the telomeric 
n
 probe for better identification of chromosome ends. in addition, some isophya species/subspecies/populations for which rdna cluster data were previously available  <cit>  were included in our analysis. furthermore, conventional methods, such as c-banding and fluorochrome cma <dig> and dapi staining, were used to analyze heterochromatin composition in representatives of both genera. the main objectives of the present work were to test  how the structure and distribution of rdna clusters and heterochromatin affect the genomic organization of poecilimon and isophya,  whether the general tendencies in chromosomal organization correspond to morphoacoustic specializations, and  whether these tendencies reflect recent concepts concerning the systematics and phylogeny of both genera.

RESULTS
all analyzed poecilimon and isophya species showed a 2n =  <dig> karyotype in the males and a 2n =  <dig> karyotype in the females with an x0/xx sex determination system. acrocentric autosomes were divided into two groups: four long  and eleven medium or short ones , both of which gradually decreased in size and sometimes minor length differences in chromosome pairs might cause problems with their precise identification. combining the results of all cytogenetic markers allowed for the identification of homologous chromosome targets, yet sometimes the ordering of particular pairs could be imprecise. in most poecilimon species, the x chromosome was acrocentric, except for subacrocentric chromosomes in p. jonicus tessellatus, p. martinae, and p. macedonicus . similarly to the results published previously  <cit> , most isophya species analyzed in this study exhibited a subacrocentric x .

cytogenetic mapping of ribosomal and telomeric dna and nors
cytogenetic maps of 18s rdna were obtained for  <dig> poecilimon taxa  and  <dig> isophya taxa  . representative hybridized metaphasic chromosomes or bivalents are shown in figures 1a–h, 1a’–h’ and 2a–i, and 2a’–i’. in both genera, the number of rdna sites per haploid genome ranged from one to five; they were located on the autosomes, and rarely on the sex chromosome – in p. macedonicus , p. marmaraensis , p. ukrainicus/fussii , and also i. pavelii , i. major , and one population of i. rectipennis .

most poecilimon taxa carried one  or two  rdna loci, and only two species exhibited four loci . when a single rdna cluster was detected, it was always located on a small pair near the paracentromeric region ; only in p. jonicus tessellatus it appeared in the interstitial region . two rdna clusters were evident on long/medium and short chromosome pairs near the paracentromeric region , except for p. macedonicus  and p. aff. glandifer . fish revealed rdna on four bivalents only in p. affinis  and p. zwicki . while the number of 18s rdna loci varied from one to five in isophya, most species showed two locations ; rarely one , three , four , or five  clusters  . most 18s rdna loci were situated in different-sized autosomes in the paracentromeric region, however distally to the centromere on a long pair  in i. straubei ssp. , as well as on the subacrocentric x chromosome and a medium-sized bivalent  in i. rectipennis from both bulgarian populations .

individuals from different populations demonstrated the same rdna-fish signal location in poecilimon brunneri, p. roseoviridis, p. macedonicus, p. schmidtii, isophya miksici, i. longicaudata longicaudata, i. modestior , i. rhodopensis petkovi, and i. tosevski. on the other hand, interpopulation variation in the rdna signal pattern observed in p. armeniacus and i. rectipennis , was also previously reported in i. bureschi, i. rhodopensis rhodopensis, and i. rh. rhodopensis/i. rh. leonorae intermediate forms  <cit>  . sometimes the rdna cluster varied in size between homologous chromosomes .

fish with the

 probe  was used for spermatogonial or oogonial mitosis and spermatocyte nuclei at different stages of meiosis. in all species of both genera, tdna-fish signals were detected at the distal ends of most chromosomes, but showed variation in size and intensity on the autosomes and x chromosomes in some species .

in all the species examined in the present study, rdna-fish signals were co-localized with the active nors visualized by agno <dig> staining . a lack of a full congruency between rdna location and nor activity has been previously reported for some autosomes and the x chromosome only in four isophya species  <cit> .

heterochromatin patterns revealed by banding techniques
table  <dig> shows variation among the analyzed species and genera using c–banding  and dapi/cma <dig> patterns. heterochromatin blocks can be characterized as dapi-/cma3+ , dapi+/ cma3-  or dapi+/cma3+ . generally, thick c-bands on most chromosomes showed bright dapi+ and cma3+ signals in pericentromeric or, rarely, interstitial or distal regions. in such cases, dapi and cma <dig> blocks were located very close to each other, but only bright cma <dig> signals coincided with 18s rdna and active nors . in some species at-bands were not detected , while bright cma3+ bands were co-localized with rdna-fish/nor signals . unfortunately, it was not possible to separate dapi/cma <dig> regions to compare them with rdna locations in poecilimon bischoffi, p. orbelicus, p. aff. ledereri, and p. marmaraensis.

some species in both studied genera exhibited heteromorphism in terms of rdna-fish signal size/strength and c/dapi/cma <dig> bands between homologue chromosomes or different-sized autosomes ; for example, in p. zwicki , i. thracica , i. cf. armena , i. rectipennis , i. yaraligozi , and isophya sp. .

discussion
by mapping rdna  and two heterochromatin classes we set out to determine whether these methods may be used to identify chromosome markers useful for studying the genomic organization and diversity of poecilimon and isophya and for distinguishing evolutionary lineages. the differences and similarities revealed between the two genera are listed below.

differences in genome organization revealed by cytogenetic markers
given the stable karyotype in both genera , variation in the number of acrocentric chromosomes involved only the sex chromosomes. this could be due to the occurrence of a pericentric inversion that converted the original/ancestral acrocentric x chromosome to a subacro-/submetacentric one. these karyotype characteristics were found in  <dig> out of  <dig> isophya taxa , but in only three out of  <dig> poecilimon species/subspecies . thus, changes in the morphology of the x chromosomes are common in isophya, in contrast to poecilimon and other barbitistini  <cit> .

based on the number of rdna clusters, the genus poecilimon was divided into two main, almost equal, groups carrying the fish signal on one or two chromosomes. in turn, the prevalent number of rdna locations in isophya was two, while either one or 3– <dig> locations occurred in some cases. three rdna clusters were usually connected with a large amount of heterochromatin in the chromosome set . a high number of nors/rdna loci with variable positions is characteristic of some other barbitistini , involving groups of species of recent origin. in both analyzed genera, most species had rdna on one or two chromosomes, which makes it difficult, especially in poecilimon, to assess their ancestral status. the presence of paracentromeric rdna loci only on a single bivalent was previously observed in other phaneropterinae species: the european odontura <cit>  and phaneroptera falcata <cit> , as well as in the african lunidia viridis <cit>  and four species of the genus eurycorypha <cit> . in other tettigoniidae, single rdna-positive fish signals have been observed in european representatives of saginae and bradyporinae  <cit> . in addition, one active nor seems to be a typical feature of karyotypes with the ancestral chromosome number in tettigoniinae  <cit> .

thick c/dapi/cma <dig> bands were observed on most chromosomes in poecilimon suggesting the presence of more families of repetitive dna sequences in this genus as compared to the heterochromatin patterns in isophya. thus, these bands appear to be a feature differentiating the karyotypes of the two genera . a high amount of heterochromatin was earlier reported for some other genera of barbitistini  <cit> .

similarities in genome organization revealed by cytogenetic markers
all the studied species had an ancestral  diploid chromosome number, and thus the variability in the number and location of rdna loci probably resulted from transposition involving mobile elements or ectopic recombination. similar mechanisms have been suggested for acrididae  <cit> , lepidoptera  <cit> , and scarabaeinae  <cit> . generally, rdna loci are coincident with active nors and gc-rich heterochromatin, which indicates the presence of multiple repetitive dna sequences. some species in both genera showed different intensities of rdna hybridization signals on homologous pairs of autosomes, and also heteromorphism in the pattern of heterochromatin distribution . these differences were detected consistently by all the banding techniques used and observed in those chromosomes in which heterochromatin occurred in large quantities . such intraspecific polymorphism may be the result of different mechanisms, i.e. tandem duplication of ribosomal genes, unequal meiotic crossing-over, translocation rearrangements, or homologous recombination  <cit> .

our results point to some general patterns in the structure of heterochromatin and nor/18s rdna locations:  dapi and cma <dig> staining cause bright fluorescence co-occurring with thick paracentromeric c-blocks, suggesting the presence of a high number of at- and cg-base pairs;  sometimes cma <dig> does not detect active nors but a special type of gc-rich heterochromatin associated with this region  <cit> ;  nor/rdna-fish regions show a bright cma <dig> signal;  the pattern of distribution of gc-rich blocks indicates some level of dynamism in the genome content of heterochromatin areas and may be related to specific changes characterizing groups of taxa. thus, different heterochromatin types suggest the occurrence of specific rearrangements of repetitive dna families that have evolved during the diversification of isophya and poecilimon and are characteristic of certain phylogroups.

a comparison of cytogenetic and taxonomic traits
the evolution of repeated dna families is dominated by genomic events such as duplication and spreading which may impede tracking the evolutionary history of the sequence, and thus prevent using these as genetic markers. however, in some cases we find concordance of cytogenetic data with phylogenetic traits such as morphology, bioacoustics, and molecular data. previously published phylogenies  <cit>  and speculations on species groupings using morphology and behavior are discussed below and summarized in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> . the european representatives of the poecilimon ampliatus group  sensu stricto <cit>  with monophyletic origin  <cit>  show a more or less uniform location of two paracentromeric rdna clusters on long and short autosome pairs, while the anatolian species along with p. orbelicus  exhibit only one fish signal. this may provide additional data for refining species relationships by exploring correlations with morphological and behavioral traits  <cit> . interesting examples deserving particular attention include the little known p. glandifer and p. ataturki, which were placed within the p. ampliatus group  <cit> , possibly on account of having an abdominal tergal gland . and though their affinities have not been phylogenetically studied yet, there is some evidence  supporting their cytogenetic distinctness from group  <dig>  an example of concordance of the present data with morphological, behavioral, and molecular traits is group  <dig>  including taxa of the p. syriacus group  <cit> . two groups of sibling species are divided between one and two rdna-fish signal positions – the p. bosphoricus group   <cit>  and the p. brunneri group   <cit> . no proposed relationships between these were reflected in the chromosome markers, except for the phylogenetic affinities of representatives of the p. bosphoricus group with one chromosome rdna location , which are polyphyletic with respect to those with two locations , according to mtdna data  <cit> . the four rdna clusters in p. zwicki  and p. affinis probably represent autapomorphies.

the genus isophya shows a more complicated pattern of rdna/heterochromatin organization than poecilimon. in most taxa, two 18s rdna sequences were located on two chromosome pairs. this seems to be a plesiomorphic state for the group, characteristic of the most primitive lineages  <cit> , for example, i. hospodar, i. straubei , and i. rectipennis . yet, all of these exhibit quite a peculiar location of the studied markers. in some taxa, a significant variation of chromosome markers  corresponds to distinct intraspecific and intrapopulation genetic and/or morphoacoustic variation  <cit> . three to five fish signal-positive chromosomes have been found in taxa of recent origin and/or populations where hybridization by secondary contact of haplotypes is suspected. the latter case concerns the i. modesta group of species  <cit> , and especially the i. rhodopensis complex, representing a few subspecies inhabiting a large area of secondary contact between possibly formerly isolated populations, where intrapopulation variation in the number of rdna clusters is observed. this is usually connected with ongoing speciation and hybridization in zones of secondary contact  <cit> .

according to our results analyzed in conjunction with known systematic and phylogenetic data transposition and recombination, or, alternatively, occasional loss of rdna fragments clusters, may have often occurred multiple times in different lineages of isophya and, rarely, in poecilimon. similar events resulting in a variable heterochromatin structure have been observed in other groups of barbitistini, mostly taking place within or between taxa of recent origin  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the cytogenetic study presented herein constitutes the next step towards a better understanding of chromosomal organization and evolution within phaneropterinae. we have outlined some general tendencies of chromosomal organization within isophya and poecilimon. these may result in unique species-specific characters or involve homoplastic changes in distinct lineages. and although chromosomal distribution of repeated dna sequences could represent intrinsic aspects of the evolutionary dynamics of the repeated dna families, our results have sometimes reflected inferences based on morphological, behavioral, and/or gene-sequence data. thus, mapping of rdna sequences and heterochromatin may in some cases be used as an additional marker for understanding relationships and routes of speciation within barbitistini.
