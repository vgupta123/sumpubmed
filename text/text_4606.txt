BACKGROUND
the ever-increasing number of new chemical entities  has prompted the development of research methods for rapid screening. present research efforts are therefore directed at developing a series of in vitro assays that could be applied for preclinical screening of nces. by utilizing in vitro models, pharmaceutical companies attempt to reduce clinical failure rates by accurately evaluating efficacy and safety much earlier in the drug discovery process  <cit> . as the liver is the principal organ for xenobiotic biotransformation and thus a key target for drug-induced toxicity, in vitro models to predict drug metabolism are preferably derived from human liver tissues. however, the use of human hepatocytes is limited by scarcity of intact and fresh human liver tissue  <cit> . in addition, primary hepatocyte cultures still cope with a progressive occurrence of dedifferentiation, resulting in a relative short life-span and a rapid decline of liver-specific functions  <cit> . different alternatives have been explored to overcome these difficulties, including the use of human stem cells. in vivo as well as in vitro studies have provided evidence that stem cells can overcome germ lineage restrictions and express molecular characteristics of cells of different tissue origin  <cit> .

the best characterized stem cell compartment is the bone marrow consisting of two stem cell populations, referred to as the hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells  <cit> . the latter was first described by friedenstein et al. as a population of cells isolated from the bone marrow and capable of differentiation into bone, adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, osteoprogenitors, skeletal myocytes, tendon and bone marrow stromal cells  <cit> .

schwartz et al. described a novel population of cells within postnatal rat bone marrow, named multipotent adult progenitor cells , that were not only capable to differentiate into most mesodermal cell types, but also into functional neuroectodermal and endodermal  cell types  <cit> .

in the present study, we investigated whether hmsc also have the potential to differentiate in vitro into functional hepatocytes. therefore, hmsc were cultivated in the presence of 'hepatogenic' factors, added either as a cocktail  or, more innovative, in a sequential manner closely reflecting their temporal expression during in vivo hepatogenesis . next, giving the promising differentiation-inducing properties of histone deaceylase inhibitors  in primary cultures of adult hepatocytes  <cit>  and hepatoma cell lines  <cit> , we additionally examined the effect of tsa, a potent and specific hydroxamic acid-based hdac-i, on hmsc cultures.

RESULTS
characterization of culture-expanded hmsc
hmsc were cultivated from the mononuclear cell fraction of bone marrow samples obtained from healthy donors. to ensure removal of contaminating hematopoietic cells, cells were selected, based on plastic adherence, and passaged  <dig> times prior to further use.

to ascertain that the culture-expanded cells were genuine msc, both their phenotype and mesodermal differentiation potential upon exposure to mesenchymal-supportive conditions, i.e. chondrogenic, osteogenic and adipogenic-specific agents, were examined . immunophenotypic analysis revealed expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> and no expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> . von kossa and oil-red o staining confirmed the presence of calcium deposits, characteristic for osteogenic cells, and lipid droplets, respectively. immunohistological staining for collagen type ii verified chondrogenic differentiation . in summary, these results indicate that the expanded cells have the basic properties of genuine msc.

differentiation of hmsc under 'hepatogenic-supporting' conditions
to evaluate whether hmsc could differentiate into endodermal cells, as described earlier for mapc  <cit> , cells were exposed to hepatogenic agents, either as a cocktail  <cit>  or in a sequential manner  <cit> , and analyzed by means of microscopic analysis and specific cytological stainings.

optimization of culture conditions
a prerequisite for differentiation in vitro is cell cycle arrest. in preliminary experiments, we found that, in the presence of cytokines and growth factors, a non-proliferative status is only obtained at 100% confluence. therefore, the latter cell density was further applied in all differentiation experiments.

endogenic differentiation upon sequential exposure of hmsc to hepatogenic factors
in contrast to mapc  <cit> , hmsc did not gain typical morphologic and phenotypic characteristics of hepatocytes upon exposure to a cocktail of hepatogenic factors. on the opposite, sequential treatment of hmsc with fgf- <dig>  hgf, its and dexamethasone in a time-dependent order closely reflecting their secretion pattern during in vivo liver ontogeny  resulted in upregulation of glycogen uptake from day  <dig> onwards . from days 8– <dig> onwards, cells also expressed ck <dig> , a cytoskeletal filament present in hepatocytes. the morphology of the differentiated cells, however, did not resemble hepatocytes.

tsa, a trigger for functional maturation of endogenic differentiating hmsc
in an attempt to enhance endogenic differentiation of hmsc, tsa, a selective and reversible hdac-i  <cit> , was added to the culture media in a concentration of  <dig> μm after exposure of the cells to the hepatogenic factors.

optimization of culture conditions
besides the state of growth arrest, 'time' is often critical for successful 'trans'differentiation of  cells in epigenetic regulating processes  <cit> . more specifically, promotion of 'trans'differentiation into a specific lineage by means of hdac inhibition often requires selective pre-stimulation of the cells. in preliminary experiments, we searched for the most optimal differentiation conditions. hereto, we examined the effect of the hepatic inducing effects of  fgf- <dig>  hgf, its and dexamethasone, added alone and in different combinations , and  pre- and post-treated with the hdac inhibitor tsa. out of the results obtained, we found that  <dig> μm tsa, when added exclusively to msc at 100% confluence and without pretreatment with fgf- <dig> and hgf, was not effective in stimulating mesenchymal-to-hepatic transition. the same applies when these cells were treated with fgf- <dig> and hgf afterwards . in addition, treatment of undifferentiated hmsc with  <dig> μm tsa resulted in massive cell death and cell detachment . suppression of proliferation, in parallel with cell survival and long-term cultivation, were only obtained upon pre-stimulation of the cells with hepatogenic factors for at least  <dig> days prior to addition of  <dig> μm tsa . in spite of the good long-term cell survival, about 20% of the tsa-treated cells underwent apoptosis . in the present study, the most appropriate conditions for transdifferentiation comprised exposure of hmsc to  <dig> μm tsa, starting on the 6th day of exposure to hepatogenic cytokines and growth factors; these treatments are further referred to as 'cocktail tsa' and 'sequential tsa' conditions.

morphological features
interestingly, upon exposure to  <dig> μm tsa, added from day  <dig> on to differentiating hmsc, cells in about 25% of all bone marrow samples tested underwent a drastic morphological change, regardless of the culture condition used . after 3– <dig> days, both sequential tsa- and cocktail tsa-treated hmsc formed epithelioid cells with a clear round nucleus. fibroblastic cells, however, persisted throughout the culture time, particularly upon exposure to the cocktail tsa-condition , whereas a more homogeneous cell population was obtained in the sequential tsa set-up.

liver-specific protein expression
to evaluate whether these morphological changes were associated with enhanced differentiation towards hepatocyte-like cells, analysis of early , mid-late  and late  hepatic markers was performed at the protein level. in fact, sequentially tsa-exposed cells progressively reached an adult expression pattern: next to ck <dig> , cells also stained positive for hnf3β , afp , alb , hnf1α , mrp <dig>  and c/ebpα  and this in a specific chronological order . in line with the results at the morphological level, cocktail tsa-treatment supported hepatic differentiation only to a limited extent. more specifically, throughout the whole culture time, cells failed to express hnf1α and c/ebpα, both late liver-enriched transcription factors. also, the major hepatic drug transporter mrp <dig> was not expressed .

hepatic functionality
to evaluate whether these hepatocyte-like cells derived from adult human bone marrow also acquired typical functional hepatic features, alb secretion, ammonia metabolism and inducible cyp-dependent activity were next analysed.

alb secretion
 <dig> μm tsa, added to sequentially-treated hmsc from day  <dig> onwards , significantly upregulated the alb secretion rate from day  <dig> onwards  when compared with regular sequential cultures . a limited upregulation of the alb secretion was also detected upon cocktail tsa-exposure. the raise, however, was not significant and less distinctive than observed after sequential tsa-treatment. hmsc cultivated without tsa did not secrete alb .

ureogenesis
upon sequential tsa-exposure, the urea production increased in a time-dependent manner, reaching similar levels as measured in  <dig> hours-cultured adult hepatocytes after 24– <dig> days differentiation . cocktail tsa-exposed hmsc could also synthesize urea; however levels remained stable and were, even at peak production, significantly lower   than the sequential tsa condition . in contrast, sequentially and cocktail-exposed cells, cultivated without tsa, did not metabolize ammonia .

cyp-dependent activity and inducibility
sequentially-exposed hmsc expressed functionally active cyp2b <dig> . in contrast, no cyp-dependent activity could be measured upon cocktail-treatment. additional exposure to  <dig> μm tsa significantly promoted the metabolising capacity of cyp2b <dig> and cyp1a1/ <dig> from days  <dig> and  <dig> onwards, respectively, regardless of the experimental set-up  . by day  <dig>  ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase -activity even increased towards levels measured in  <dig> hours-cultivated primary hepatocytes . comparable to the results obtained for alb and urea secretion, throughout the culture time, the metabolising capacity of sequential tsa-treated cells exceeded that of cocktail tsa-exposed cells .

the potential to induce cyp-dependent monooxygenases is considered as one of the most representative functional parameters to evaluate the adult hepatic phenotype  <cit> . therefore, the responsiveness of both cyp1a1/ <dig> and cyp2b <dig> to their respective prototype inducers 3-methylcholantrene  and phenobarbital  was studied in parallel. interestingly, only tsa-treated cells exhibited inducible cyp-activities . more specifically, upon tsa-treatment pentoxyresorufin-o-dealkylase -activities were significantly induced up to  <dig>  fold after  <dig> days exposure to pb , regardless of the experimental configuration . the inducibility persisted throughout the culture time . in addition, a significant  <dig>  fold cyp1a1/2-dependent response to mc was observed on days 24– <dig> in the sequential tsa-model . cocktail tsa-treated cells also showed inducible erod-activity, but to a significantly lesser extent  .

an overview of all experiments performed along with their outcome per condition is summarized in table  <dig> 

: negative; ,,: weak positive, positive, strong positive, respectively; nt: not tested.

tsa causes accumulation of acetylated histone h4
the question, however, still remains whether the improved hepatic differentiation of hmsc, upon exposure to  <dig> μm tsa, is mediated by tsa-induced hdac inhibition. since histone h <dig> is a known target of tsa , the acetylated status of this protein was analysed by means of immunofluorescence.

histone h <dig> was indeed clearly hyperacetylated in both the cocktail tsa and sequential tsa set-up when compared to the appropriate controls. affecting the acetylated status of histone proteins could thus be proposed here to regulate cell fate.

discussion
hepatocyte-based in vitro models are often-used tools for pharmaco-toxicological research and could also become an interesting tool for regulatory testing of xenobiotics  <cit> . a serious drawback, however, is the occurrence of cellular dedifferentiation  <cit>  and the shortage of cells of human origin. the use of stem cells could offer a solution. it is well recognized that in adult mammals, including humans, a number of tissues are continuously regenerated from immature cells   <cit> . the interest in adult stem cells has in particular been triggered by the numerous ethical dilemmas surrounding the use of embryonic stem cells in preclinical and clinical research  <cit> . consequently, successful isolation, cultivation and manipulation of multipotent stem cells from non-embryonic origin could provide researchers with an unlimited human cell source for cell and organ development studies, preclinical pharmaco-toxicological research and regulatory testing.

in the current study, we investigated the in vitro endodermal potency of hmsc. hmsc were hereto exposed to well-defined hepatogenic agents, added either as a cocktail  or, more innovative, in a sequential time-dependent order as seen during liver embryogenesis .

exposure of hmsc to a cocktail of hepatogenic factors failed to induce mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. in contrast, sequential treatment with these hepatogenic agents  not only induced expression of the mid-late hepatic marker ck <dig> from day  <dig> onwards but also resulted in hepatic functionality, as evidenced by upregulated glycogen storage from days  <dig> to  <dig> and acquisition of cyp2b6-activity, though not inducible, from day  <dig> onwards. however, cells did not morphologically resemble adult hepatocytes.

as a trigger for further differentiation of hmsc towards the endodermal lineage, tsa, known as a proliferation-inhibiting and differentiation-inducing agent in primary hepatocytes and hepatoma cell lines  <cit> , was introduced into the present culture media. previously, our group showed that exposure of  <dig> μm tsa to primary cultured hepatocytes induced cell cycle arrest during g0/g <dig> and g1/s phase in egf-stimulated cells, significantly retarded apoptosis and improved cell junction intercellular communication and xenobiotic biotransformation  <cit> . these findings encouraged us to expose differentiating hmsc to tsa as well. in fact, upon addition of tsa, hmsc of 1/ <dig> of the bone marrow samples tested, underwent a mesenchymal-to-hepatic transition. more specifically, differentiating tsa-exposed cells adopted an epithelial morphology, expressed liver-specific proteins and acquired functional maturation, regardless of the experimental set-up, although to a different degree. a rather homogeneous population of epithelioid cells was obtained upon sequential tsa-treatment. about 70% of these differentiated cells expressed early , mid-late  and late  hepatocyte markers in a ranking order comparable to their expression pattern during in vivo hepatogenesis. indeed, afp expression is first detected in embryonic endoderm around e <dig>   <cit>  and precedes alb, hnf1α and mrp <dig> expression, detected around e <dig> , e <dig>  and e <dig>  respectively  <cit> .

furthermore, hepatic metabolic functions, including alb secretion, urea production, and inducible cyp-activity, were manifested exclusively in tsa-treated cells and most prominently under the sequential tsa-conditions. more specifically, tsa significantly upregulated alb secretion, urea synthesis and cyp1a1/2-activities to levels comparable to those found in  <dig> hours- to  <dig> days-old monolayer cultures of adult hepatocytes  <cit> . in line with the behaviour of adult hepatocytes, both in vitro and in vivo, responses to the prototype inducers mc and pb were pronounced and discrete, respectively; however, levels of induction, measured in the bone marrow-derived hepatocyte-like cells remained lower than in true adult hepatocytes.

on the other hand, cocktail tsa-treated cells also featured hepatic phenotype and function, but less differentiated, which corresponds well to the persistence of processes throughout the culture time.

recently, the hepatic differentiation potential of msc, derived from bone marrow, adipose tissue and umbilical cord blood, has been affirmed by showing expression of distinct hepatocyte markers and functions, including alb and urea secretion, glycogen storage and ldl uptake, upon in vitro conditioning  of the cells  <cit> . in contrast to our findings, a functional hepatic phenotype was generally not seen before  <dig> – <dig> weeks post-stimulation. in addition, no inducible cyp-dependent activity was reported, which is considered to be a key determinant of the functional hepatic phenotype, and a prerequisite for applicability of the cells as in vitro models for preclinical drug testing. only one study described inducible cyp2b <dig> expression at both the mrna and protein-level  <cit>  but not before  <dig> to  <dig> weeks preconditioning of the cells  <cit> . in contrast, our tsa-exposed cells already possessed prod -dependent activity and -inducibility upon  <dig> days differentiation.

in line with our results, seo et al.,  <dig> showed enhanced hepatic differentiation upon addition of  <dig> % dimethylsulfoxide  to human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells , prestimulated for  <dig> days with a cocktail of hepatogenic cytokines  <cit> . the mechanism underlying the hepatic differentiation-inducing effects of dmso have not yet been fully elucidated. however, like tsa, histone hyperacetylation-inducing effects have been ascribed to dmso as well  <cit> .

other research groups showed hepatic differentation of hmsc upon stimulation to hepatogenic cytokines exclusively, added either as a mixture . conform to our experience, the results shown by lange et al.,  <dig> disagreed with those reports  <cit> . the reasons underlying these controversial results are unknown. however, part might be ascribed to subtle differences in hmsc isolation/expansion techniques, and microenvironment , playing a decisive role in the specific and directed differentiation of stem/progenitor cells. additionally, it should be taken into consideration that the plasticity of stem/progenitor cells highly depends on the tissue harvest site and the donor's profile . the differentiating potential of bone marrow-derived msc, in fact, decreases with age  <cit> . in our study, most bone marrow samples were harvested from elderly patients, which might also form a part of the answer. in addition, the hepatic differentiation efficiency of all bone marrow samples tested in the present study yielded 25%, postulating influence of donor-related variability as well. the elucidation of all factors involved seems thus of primary importance and will be explored in future experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
the developmental process of hepatocytes towards a fully polarized and functional phenotype is known to depend on a complex network of transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory events. to our best knowledge, the results presented in this paper  are the first to indicate that hdac inhibition is, next to acquiring and maintaining differentiated functions in primary cells and cell lines, a key-factor to differentiate bone marrow-derived hmsc into functional hepatocyte-like cells, particularly under sequential culture conditions mimicking in vivo hepatogenesis.

long-term cultivation and successful transdifferentiation of hmsc could be shown under both set-ups , though a relatively high number  of tsa-treated cells died, due to apoptosis. a feasible explanation could be that tsa, accompanied by hepatogenic agents, promotes selective survival of differentiating cells towards the hepatocyte lineage by inducing apoptosis of non-  differentiating cells.

the established model opens new perspectives: it offers an unlimited source of functional human hepatocyte-like cells of non-embryonic origin, applicable in basic research , preclinical drug discovery and development, and cell and organ design. it might open a road for 'trans'-differentiation of cell types from different tissues towards endodermal lineages. in addition, as a consequence of their extensive self-renewing capacity, these cells may, in future, overcome the shortage of human donor tissue contributing as such to tissue regeneration in congenital and degenerative disorders.
