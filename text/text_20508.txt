BACKGROUND
transcriptional control is the single most important regulatory mechanism in all organisms. it ultimately depends on transcription factors  that recognise cis-regulatory elements in the promoters of their target genes. it has become evident that tfs are essential components in the regulation of many traits in plants, including some of agronomic importance such as yield or response to biotic or abiotic stresses and to hormones. tfs have played also a central role in crop domestication and in the evolution of plants  <cit> . molecular genetic studies have so far identified major domestication genes in plants, and many of them encode tfs  <cit> , including the rice shattering genes sh <dig> and qsh <cit> , the teosinte branched <dig>  gene, first described in maize, which affects plant architecture  <cit> , and the ap2-like wheat gene q, which is involved in the inflorescence structure  <cit> .

the availability of plant genome sequences has made a great impact on plant biology, defining the protein-coding content of several species and illustrating how these have increased in complexity during the evolution of higher plants  <cit> . complex organisms contain a large number of tfs. in plants, ≈ 7% of all genes encode putative tfs  <cit> ; by genome-wide identification, the arabidopsis and the rice genomes have been predicted to contain at least  <dig>  tf genes  <cit>  and over  <dig>  tf genes in the brachypodium distachyon genome  <cit> .

the tf proteins are composed of at least two discrete domains: a dna binding domain, which interacts with cis-regulatory elements in the promoters of their target genes, and an activation or repression domain. tfs operate in complex networks based on protein-protein interactions to regulate many physiological and biochemical processes by modulating the rate of transcriptional initiation. this combinatorial control, involving both transcriptional activators and repressors, integrates signals and results in diverse outcomes of gene expression. tfs are classified into families, mainly on the basis of their conserved dna binding domains, and both, the number of families, as well as, the number of members in each family have increased in the course of evolution  <cit> .

the dof  transcription factor family belongs to the class of zinc finger domains and it is characterized by a binding domain of  <dig> amino acid residues that is structured as a cys2cys <dig>  zinc finger  <cit>  that binds specifically to cis-regulatory elements containing the common core 5’-t/aaaag-3’  <cit> . the family has evolved from a common ancestor in chlamydomonas reinharditii, where only one dof gene has been found, and expanded into the different taxonomic groups from ferns and mosses to vascular plants  <cit> . dof tfs are not found in other eukaryotes such are yeast, drosophila, caenorhabditis or humans. the number of dof genes varies depending on the species; bioinformatic analysis of the arabidopsis and rice genome predicts  <dig> and  <dig> dof genes respectively  <cit> , while  <dig> have been described in barley  <cit> ,  <dig> in wheat  <cit> , and  <dig> in sorghum  <cit> .

since the identification of the first dof protein, zmdof <dig>  from maize, that acts as a transcriptional activator of the light regulated c <dig> phospho-enol-pyruvate-carboxylase  gene  <cit> , dof genes have been extensively studied from various plant species. generally, dof proteins are reported to participate as transcriptional regulators in many plant-specific biological processes, such is the case of cdf <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dof proteins from a. thaliana that regulate the photoperiodic flowering time by repressing the constans gene  <cit> . hppbf <dig>  cog <dig> and obp <dig> are three dof proteins that participate in the signalling pathways mediated by phytochrome a and b and cryptochrome  <dig>  <cit> . the obp binding proteins  interact with the ocs stress-response element in plant promoters  <cit> . other dof transcription factors such as atdof <dig> /hca <dig> regulates inter-fascicular cambium and vascular tissue formation  <cit> , and atdof <dig>  is expressed in the abscission zone of flowers and participates in the expression of cell wall hydrolytic enzymes  <cit> . in arabidospsis, the dof proteins dag <dig> and dag <dig> influence, with opposite effects, seed germination  <cit> , and dof <dig> has been recently characterized as a negative regulator of seed germination that interacts with tcp <dig>  <cit> .

the nicotiana tabacum ntbbf, is induced by auxin and acts as a regulator of the expression of the oncogene rolb <cit> . in potato stdof <dig> regulates guard cells specific gene expression  <cit>  and stsrf <dig> modulates the carbohydrate metabolism in the storage roots  <cit> . psdof <dig> from pisum sativum activates the expression of the chloroplast thioredoxins f and m that are linked to short-term changes in the sugar and thiol status in plants  <cit> . in the higher plant ancestor physcomitrella patens the ppdof <dig> acts as transcriptional repressor, controlling nutrient-dependent filament growth  <cit> .

in cereal seeds, dof transcription factors have been shown to regulate gene expression both during seed maturation and upon germination. in maize, pbf  and its orthologs from barley and wheat, hvdof24-bpbf and wpbf, are important activators of genes encoding reserve proteins during endosperm development, and its presence is associated with crude protein content and starch content of barley seeds  <cit> . besides, bpbf is a transcriptional repressor of gibberellin-responsive hydrolase genes induced in the aleurone layers upon seed germination  <cit> . another barley dof, hvdof23-sad, has been shown to activate gene expression both during seed maturation and upon germination  <cit> . other dof proteins from barley, hvdof <dig> and hvdof <dig>  mediate the aba-repression of hydrolase genes in germinating aleurone cells  <cit> . these dof regulators interact physically with other proteins belonging to different tf families such as bzip, mybr2r <dig>  mybr <dig> and wrky  <cit> . other seed dofs, like gmdof <dig> and gmdof <dig> from soybean, have been implicated in lipid metabolism and their over-expression in a. thaliana increase seed lipid content by activating genes associated with fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> .

brachypodium distachyon has been the first member to be sequenced within the triticeae tribe  <cit> , that includes important crops like wheat, barley and oats  <cit> . due to its small genome size, short life cycle, and easy transformation, brachypodium has become a model system for functional genomic studies in temperate cereals.

this paper reports genome wide in silico identification of the dof gene family of b. distachyon. phylogenetic comparison with closely related dof proteins from rice and barley has been done, as well as, an expression analysis with special emphasis during seed maturation and germination.

RESULTS
in silico identification of brachypodium distachyon dof encoding genes
to identify the dof proteins encoded by the b. distachyon genome, the consensus amino acid sequence of the dna binding domain of dof proteins, previously annotated from barley  <cit> , has been used to perform a blast against the whole brachypodium genome database   <cit> . twenty seven non-redundant dof transcription factor genes have been identified  numbered from bddof <dig> to bddof <dig>  according to their homology to the corresponding barley dofs. all of them have a typical binding domain of  <dig> residues spanning a single c2/c <dig> zinc finger structure . their schematic distribution along the five brachypodium chromosomes appears in figure 1a and their exon-intron structure is shown in figure 1b. according to their predicted structures, sixteen of the bddof genes have no introns whereas ten of them contain one intron, generally placed up-stream of the dna binding domain, with the exception of bddof <dig> with an intron down-stream of it, and of bddof <dig>  which has two introns. the highly conserved  <dig> residues of the binding domain of b. distachyon dofs, has been used to produce a phylogenetic tree  where these proteins are grouped into four major clusters a; b; c and d. clusters a and c comprise the majority of bddof family members , whereas the clusters b and d contain only  <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively. a high bootstrap value, as well as, the comparative analyses of the deduced amino acid sequences of the bddof proteins by the meme software supports this phylogenetic tree  <cit> . the schematic representation of the different conserved motifs can be found in additional file  <dig>  and the amino acid consensus sequence of each motif in additional file  <dig> 

phylogenetic comparison of dof proteins from brachypodium, barley and rice
in order to gain insight into the evolutionary relationships among the dof proteins from brachypodium, rice and barley, a combined phylogenetic tree has been constructed  where these proteins are grouped into four major clusters of orthologous groups  subdivided into subfamilies. several putative orthologs  and paralogs  have been identified. this phylogenetic tree is further supported by the comparative analyses of the deduced amino acid sequences of the whole dof proteins by the meme software . the majority of the conserved motifs are found in a given subfamily, with the exception of motif  <dig> that is found both in subfamilies a <dig> and a <dig> of mcog a. the d family members have only in common the dof binding domain.

a numbers correspond to the motifs described in figure  <dig>  b consensus amino acid sequences obtained from the analysis of the  <dig> brachypodium, rice and barley dof genes with the meme software. motifs from  <dig> to  <dig> are equivalent to the motifs  <dig> to  <dig> described in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  motif  <dig> corresponds to the dof dna-binding domain.

expression of the bddof genes in the major organs of b. distachyon
to study the expression of the annotated bddof genes, rt-qpcr analyses have been done in several organs: leaves , roots , pre-anthesis spikes , developing seeds , dry embryos , and germinating seeds . in this latter case, germinating embryo  and the de-embryonated seed containing the germinating aleurone  have been processed separately. for this purpose, a set of gene-specific primers from the 3’-non coding regions of the bddof genes have been designed; to ensure reliability of the data, primer pairs that displayed pcrs efficiencies between  <dig> ±  <dig>  have been selected  and the expression values compared to that of the constitutive bdgapdh gene   <cit> . a colored schematic representation has been done  using the tm <dig> software  <cit> ; in additional file  <dig> the expression values of the bddof genes  can be found. according to their expression profiles, the genes have been divided into two groups: the  <dig> genes with the highest seed expression values are grouped in figure 5a; in figure 5b, the global expression of the  <dig> remaining bddof genes are included.

among the genes preferentially expressed in seeds , bddof <dig> presents their maximum transcript levels in the developing seeds, but it is also abundantly expressed in dry embryos and can be detected, although moderately, in the de-embryonated germinating seeds . transcripts of bddof <dig> are especially abundant in dry embryos and faintly detected during seed maturation. the most abundant transcript in germinating seeds is that of bddof <dig>  both in the embryos and in the rest of the seeds. bddof <dig> is ubiquitously expressed and its transcripts are abundant in leaves, pre-anthesis spikes and in the maturation phase of seeds. genes bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig> and bddof <dig> are expressed preferentially in leaves, and bddof <dig>  bddof <dig> and bddof <dig> are also abundant in roots.

the bddof genes appearing in figure 5b are poorly expressed in seeds. however twelve of them are present in leaves, and four of these: bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig> and bddof <dig> are also found in roots . the transcripts of the bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig> and bddof <dig> are faintly detectable in all the organs analyzed.

expression profiles of the bddof genes during seed development
a more detailed expression profile for the genes included in figure 5a has been further investigated in the two phases of seed development: maturation and germination. seeds have been collected at different maturation stages , and in germinating seeds at different hours after imbibition ; in this case the embryos have been processed separately from the rest of the seeds. the expression profile for the bddof genes analysed is shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> 

the most abundant transcripts in seeds during maturation are those of bddof <dig>  with a sharp peak of expression at  <dig> dap . similarly, the expression of the genes bddof <dig>  bddof <dig> and bddof <dig> increases during development, whereas bddof <dig> presents a high expression level at the beginning and at the end of the maturation period considered , decreasing to low levels at the middle stage . the less abundant transcripts of this group are those of genes bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig> and bddof <dig>  their expression moderately increasing with seed maturation with the exception of bddof <dig> that has a peak at  <dig> dap and decreases thereafter .

in figure  <dig>  the expression kinetics in the embryos and in the de-embrionated  germinating seeds of bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  and bddof <dig> are presented. the most abundant transcripts in both cases are those of bddof <dig>  but whereas in de-embrionated germinating seeds , the transcript levels increase progressively with time of imbibition reaching a plateau value  from  <dig> hai to  <dig> hai, in germinating embryos an expression peak is reached at  <dig> hai that sharply decreases after  <dig> hai. in germinating seeds, the transcripts of bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig> and bddof <dig> are barely detected .

discussion
transcriptional regulation is an important mechanism underlying gene expression; the number, position and interaction between different cis-elements and the tfs at a given gene promoter determine the gene expression pattern. these tfs can be classified into gene families according to the presence of a particular dna-binding domain. in this study, we have conducted a comprehensive search to identify the family of bddof genes in the brachypodium distachyon genome database. a complete overview of this gene family in brachypodium is presented, including a multiple sequence alignment, the intron-exon structures, a phylogenetic comparison with closely related cereal species and its expression in different organs.

the overall intron-exon structure indicates that, the majority of bddof genes are intronless, as observed in other species, or have one intron, as occurs with five members of cluster a; exceptionally bddof <dig> in cluster c have two introns  <cit> . multiple sequence alignment of these bddof proteins with the  <dig> amino acid residues spanning the dof binding domain have defined four groups of paralogous genes in brachypodium, that share common proteins motifs outside the dof domain, detected in the meme analysis. the comparative phylogenetic analysis of these bddof proteins with those from rice and barley, have defined four mcogs.

rt-qpcr analysis has shown that the majority of bddof genes are expressed in leaves, although nine of them are highly  expressed in seeds. no similarities in expression patterns are generally observed within members of the same cluster of paralogous genes, although bddof <dig> and bddof <dig> in cluster c, that share at least five motifs outside of the binding domain, are also quite similar in their expression patterns, indicating that probably they arose by a recent gene duplication, followed by a translocation event since they are located in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. genes preferentially expressed in leaves  are those of bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig> and bddof <dig>  a similar expression pattern has been found in some of their orthologous partners in rice, using the tool rice gene expression anatomy viewer from the rice genome annotation project  <cit> . this is the case of bddof <dig> and its orthologous osdof <dig>  and bddof <dig> and osdof <dig>  preferentially expressed in leaves are genes bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig> and bddof <dig>  although their transcripts are ubiquitous. genes bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig> and bddof <dig> are barely detected in the organs assayed.

since several studies support a role for dof tfs in the regulation of genes encoding seed storage proteins during seed maturation as well as of genes encoding hydrolases involved in the mobilization of reserves upon seed germination, we have selected for a more thorough analysis the genes highly expressed in seeds. these are bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig>  bddof <dig> and bddof <dig>  bddof <dig> is also included in the seed time-course study, because it is closely related in sequence to hvdof <dig>  an important regulator of hydrolase gene expression upon germination in barley seeds  <cit> . bddof <dig>  bddof <dig> and bddof <dig> are preferentially expressed in seeds, with very low levels of expression in the vegetative organs analysed. the rice ortholog of bddof <dig>  that is expressed in developing seeds, has been described as having a role during the grain filling process  <cit> . bddof <dig> is highly expressed in seeds, both in the maturation phase and upon germination. its putative orthologs from barley  and rice , have similar expression patterns and they are transcriptional activators of genes encoding endosperm-specific storage proteins  <cit>  and transcriptional repressors of hydrolase genes in the aleurone upon seed germination  <cit> . other dof tfs reported to be important in the regulation of barley hydrolase genes upon germination are those encoding transcriptional repressors hvdof <dig> and hvdof <dig> <cit> . the expression of their putative brachypodium orthologs shows that bddof <dig> has a predominant expression in dry embryos, as well as in de-embryonated germinating seeds, peaking at the first two stages analysed  and decreasing thereafter, and it is also expressed during maturation. the same analyses for bddof <dig> indicate that although its expression is ten times lower than that of bddof <dig> during seed maturation, its pattern is compatible with a possible role in the regulation of storage protein genes; however, no transcripts are detected in the samples of germinating seeds.

bddof <dig>  bddof <dig> and bddof <dig>  have been included in the group of genes expressed abundantly in seeds. transcript levels of bddof <dig> increase as maturation progresses and an expression peak is detected in germinating seeds . bddof <dig> and bddof <dig> are expressed in the maturation phase of seed development, and only the transcripts of bddof <dig> are detected in germinating embryos. these data suggest that bddof <dig> may have a similar role during the maturation process as its orthologous in barley hvdof23sad <cit> , and its absence in de-embryonated germinating seeds probably indicates that it does not control the expression of hydrolase genes in the aleurone as opposed to its ortholog in barley  <cit> .

although not preferentially expressed in seeds, the time course during seed maturation and germination has been studied for the three remaining genes that presented high levels in seeds: bddof <dig>  bddof <dig> and bddof <dig>  the bddof <dig> transcripts are the most abundant in the maturation phase of seed development, peaking at  <dig> dap and decreasing drastically thereafter, and can also be detected in germinating seeds; however its orthologous gene in barley has not been found among the ests and other sequences presently available.

CONCLUSIONS
the sequences of the  <dig> members belonging to the dof gene family have been compiled from the brachypodium distachyon genome database, and its inclusion into four clusters is supported by the sequence of the dna-binding domain, the conservation of different domains outside the dof domain and their intron-exon structure. a phylogenetic comparison with the barley and rice dof proteins and a detailed expression profile study in different organs together with comparison with published functions of the barley and rice dofs proteins, suggest that there is a strong sequence conservation between the dofs of these monocot species, although some of their functions may have diverged in the course of evolution . this works opens the possibility of a further more focused investigation of the functional role of these dof regulatory proteins.
