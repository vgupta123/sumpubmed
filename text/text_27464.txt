BACKGROUND
horizontal gene transfer  has played a significant role in bacterial evolution
 <cit> . hgt is widespread in prokaryotes
 <cit>  and is considered to be a driving force in the innovation and evolution of bacterial genomes
 <cit> . hgts have been shown to contribute to the genomic repertoires of a number of prokaryotes, including rickettsiales species.

the order rickettsiales has been classified into two families, rickettsiaceae and anaplasmataceae. members of the rickettsiales order are primarily intracellular bacteria and can encompass both parasitic genera, such as rickettsia and orientia, or symbiotic genera, such as wolbachia. over the course of their evolution, the intracellular lifestyle of these members has led to the irreversible loss of genes
 <cit> . orientia species cause scrub typhus in human and are classified in a separate clade from rickettsiae species
 <cit> . rickettsiae species are associated with a diverse host range that include vertebrates, arthropods, annelids, amoebae and plants and are known as arthropod-vector pathogens of vertebrate hosts
 <cit> . the family anaplasmataceae encompasses the three genera anaplasma, ehrlichia and wolbachia <cit> . a. phagocytophilum causes human granulocytic ehrlichiosis
 <cit> , e. chaffensis causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis
 <cit>  and neorickettsia sennetsu causes sennetsu ehrlichiosis, an infectious mononucleosis-like disease
 <cit> . the wolbachia species live as symbionts in arthropods and annelids. the genomes of these species demonstrate both genome reduction and gene integration events between symbionts and host nuclear genomes
 <cit> . candidatus pelagibacter ubique is a marine, free-living bacterium with a small, at-rich genome that belongs to the sar <dig> clade
 <cit> . candidatus pelagibacter ubique was included under the sister group of the rickettsiales clade in 2007
 <cit> , but the placement of this free-living bacterium in an obligate intracellular phylum remains a subject of debate
 <cit> .

hgts have occurred at high frequencies within alphaproteobacteria species
 <cit>  and within the rickettsia <cit> ; therefore, we limited our analysis to the study of genes transferred from distantly related species into rickettsiales species genomes. previously, we have reported the existence of novel hgts from a number of other genomes into rickettsiales species
 <cit> . in the current study, we have detected these new instances of transfer by developing an automated approach for the detection of hgt from complete proteomes.

currently, a number of methods exist for detecting hgts
 <cit> . the two main approaches depend on the analysis of sequence composition and the use of phylogenetic methods. the first examines atypical gc content, codon usage bias, oligonucleotide frequencies, and genomic signatures
 <cit> . the second enables the detection of inconsistencies in gene and genome evolutionary history either  by reconstructing the gene tree and comparing it with the reference species tree, i.e., via the test of topologies, bipartition, quartet bipartitions
 <cit> ; or  by examining gene history, i.e., phyletic profiles
 <cit> . we herein describe a new strategy for systematically searching for instances of hgt that depends on the use of stringent filters. using this method, a cluster of orthologous protein sequences were first retrieved and examinated for sequence similarity with the organisms of interest. this was followed by the application of phyletic pattern detection for the identification of gain events. the results were then analyzed by blast searches to retrieve sequences that were homologous to rickettsiales genomes from other organisms, excluding alphaproteobacteria. these results were then examinated by automated phylogenetic analysis, followed by the detection of instances of hgt. using this method, we were also able to verify the hgt events reported by previous studies. here, we provide a detailed description of the transferred proteins, including their predicted function and ecological niches, as well as an analysis of the function of putative transfers with no phylogenetic support.

RESULTS
clustered ortholog groups 
we analyzed  <dig>  proteins from  <dig> complete proteomes using orthomcl, of which  <dig>   proteins were found to be less than  <dig> amino acids in length and therefore discarded. from the remaining  <dig>   proteins,  <dig>   belonged to non-orthologous groups that did not form clusters, and  <dig>   were clustered into  <dig>  orthologous groups. we found that  <dig>  such clustered ortholog groups  were conserved between caulobacter cresentus cb <dig> and rickettsiales species that were among the  <dig> species included in our study . an additional  <dig> cogs were conserved among rickettsia, orientia, wolbachia, anaplasma, ehrlichia, neorickettsia, and candidatus pelagibacter ubique genome , and  <dig> cogs were conserved among rickettsia, orientia, wolbachia, anaplasma, ehrlichia, neorickettsia genomes . we found  <dig> conserved cogs among wolbachia, anaplasma, ehrlichia, and neorickettsia genomes, and  <dig> conserved cogs were found only in rickettsia and orientia genomes. we also carried out functional analyses for these orthologous groups using blastp against the cog database
 <cit>  with an e-value cutoff of less than 10- <dig> and annotated  <dig>   orthologous groups. the results of these analyses are provided in additional file
 <dig>  table s <dig> and additional file
 <dig>  figure s <dig> 

detection of gain and loss events from  <dig>  cogs
to characterize gains and losses, the presence and absence of genes from the species trees was mapped onto orthologous groups, and phyletic patterns of gene gain and gene loss events were reconstructed. the results thus obtained from pattern detection were logically classified into four types in the following manner:  <dig> gain,  <dig> loss;  <dig> gain,  <dig> loss;  <dig> gain,  <dig> loss; and at least  <dig> gain  <dig> loss . accordingly, the results from each orthologous group that fell under each type were analyzed for gain and loss events. in this way, we obtained  <dig> cogs with  <dig> gain and  <dig> loss events,  <dig> cogs with  <dig> gain and  <dig> loss, and  <dig>  cogs with at least  <dig> gain and  <dig> loss event . as mentioned previously, we evaluated only instances of gain events due to hgt, which formed the main objective of our study.

analysis of hgt cases from only gain event
the  <dig>  cogs with at least  <dig> gain event were automatically identified using blast filter, phylogenetic analysis, and hgt detection and were validated by a human expert using a bayesian approach as described in the methods. we found that  <dig>  proteins had hits outside of alphaproteobacterial species, while the remaining  <dig>   proteins had hits within alphaproteobacterial species . the  <dig> proteins were subjected to automated phylogenetic reconstruction and hgt detection. phylogenetic trees were successfully reconstructed for  <dig> % of the cases, out of which  <dig> %  were associated with strong bootstrap support for hgt, while the remaining  <dig> % were weakly supported by bootstrap values. the remaining  <dig> % of cases failed to produce phylogenetic trees based on the application of stringenet figenix parameters, which are listed as follows: gap sizes that exceeded the threshold by more than 30%; the presence of a greater number of repeats; an insufficient number of blast hits that did not allow for phylogenetic reconstruction; and detection by puzzle filter of quickly evolving sites resulting from the duplication of paralogous groups that hindered phylogenetic reconstruction. the corresponding genes may be considered to be putative cases of hgt but with weak or no phylogenetic support. we will further describe the distribution of these genes based on gene ontology  database
 <cit>  in order to classify their putative functions.

finally, we found  <dig> % of proteins  with phylogenetic support for hgt with at least  <dig> gain event, of which  <dig> cases were detected from uncultured bacteria to candidatus pelagibacter ubique  and were therefore excluded from further analysis. the remaining  <dig> cases were found to be good candidates for hgt from different organisms with well-supported bootstrap values. of these  <dig> cases, two have been reported as hgts in previous studies, gi: <dig> was reported as to be an instance of hgt from a wolbachia strain to aedes aegypti by klasson et al., 2009
 <cit>  and gi: <dig> was reported to be an instance of hgt from wolbachia phage wo into wolbachia species by wu et al., 2004
 <cit>  . the remaining  <dig> instances of hgts were present in anaplasma, wolbachia and rickettsia species genomes. these proteins were acquired from different origins, including bacterial species from bacteroidetes, firmicutes, chlamydia, spirochaetales, nitrospirales, and proteobacteria clades . the functions of these transferred proteins are diverse, including atpases, aldolases, transporter activities, cystathionine beta-lyases, sugar phosphate permeases, growth inhibitors and antitoxin activities, while the others were found to be hypothetical with no known function.

to determine the possible origin of these hypothetical proteins, we analyzed them using the aclame database. we report here only the best match, which was for gi: <dig> with plasmid: <dig> from rickettsia felis urrwxcal <dig>  with an e-value of  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> % identity. the transfer of this gene  was from actinobacillus minor nb <dig> to r. felis and r. peacockii str. rustic .

hgt cases from non-orthologous groups
we applied a similar procedure to the  <dig>  non-orthologous proteins to detect transfer events. of these,  <dig>  proteins shared with caulobacter cresentus cb <dig> and were therefore discarded from further analysis. the remaining  <dig>  proteins were analyzed by blastp against the nr database with a cutoff of e-value of 10- <dig>  of these,  <dig>  proteins had hits outside of the alphaproteobacteria species, and  <dig>   proteins had hits within alphaproteobacterial species . the  <dig> proteins were further analyzed for hgt in a similar manner to that discussed above. phylogenetic trees were reconstructed for  <dig> % of the cases, of which 53% were weakly supported and the remaining  <dig> %  were strongly supported by bootstrap values. the remaining  <dig> % of cases did not result in phylogeny due to the reasons previously discussed. thus, we identified  <dig> instances of hgt from non-orthologous proteins, of which  <dig> cases were from uncultured bacteria and were excluded from our analysis. the remaining  <dig> instances were found to be good candidates for hgt from different organisms with strong supported bootstrap values.

of these  <dig> cases, we detected two instances of hgt that had been previously reported. the transfer of gi: <dig> from yersinia species of gammaproteobacteria to rickettsia felis urrwx cal <dig> was reported by merhej et al., 2011
 <cit> , and the transfer of gi: <dig> from the cyanobacteriasynechococcus and prochlorococcus to two candidatus pelagibacter ubique strains was reported by viklund et al., 2011
 <cit>  . of the remaining  <dig> cases, 50% of the transfers were observed in candidatus pelagibacter ubique, and the remaining were present in wolbachia and rickettsia species . these proteins were acquired from different origins, including bacterial species from the firmicutes, chlorobi, cyanobacteria, bacteroidetes, actinobacteria and proteobacteria clades  as well as from archaea and metazoa . most of the transferred genes encoded unnamed proteins for which a function has not yet been determined, while others were involved in translocation and hydrolase and synthase activities. to determine the possible origins of these unnamed proteins, we compared them against the aclame database; however we were unable to identify genes with similarity above our cutoff value.

functional annotation for putative hgt cases  by gene ontology 
out of a total of  <dig>  proteins from two groups ,  <dig>  remained with no functional annotation. this group was therefore analyzed using the the go ontology database. no go terms were identified for  <dig> of the  <dig>  proteins, while the remaining  <dig>  proteins were assigned a go term related to biological processes, molecular functions or cellular components. the results obtained from the go analysis are described in additional file
 <dig>  figure s <dig> and additional file
 <dig>  table s <dig>  we focused our analysis on the 9th and the 12th dag levels of the go hierarchy. at the 9th level,  <dig> proteins were associated with molecular functions. of these,  <dig> were associated with dna helicase activity and  <dig> were assigned atp-dependent helicase activity. the remaining are showed in additional file
 <dig>  table s <dig>  at the 12th level of the go hierarchy,  <dig> proteins were associated with biological process, of which  <dig> were atp catabolic and  <dig> were gtp catabolic. an analysis of the remaining  <dig> is provided in additional file
 <dig>  table s <dig>  thus, only  <dig> of  <dig>  proteins  demonstrated significant specificity for a particular go term.

discussion
although previous studies have detected instances of horizontal gene transfer in rickettsiae species
 <cit> . hgts have not been reported in other genomes such as wolbachia, anaplasma and candidatus pelagibacter ubique. in the current study, we carried out an exhaustive analysis to investigate additional instances of hgt in  <dig> complete rickettsiales genomes and detected  <dig> new instances of hgt as well as  <dig> cases identified in previously published studies. among these, several new cases were identified in anaplasma and candidatus pelagibacter ubique as well as in rickettsia species. addionally, we carried out a functional analysis of the  <dig> hgts identified using our automated pipeline . we considered the remaining cases  with no phylogenetic support to be putative instances of transfer, and these were analyzed further by searching for go terms associated with their potential functions.

hgts between species from the same environment
we analyzed  <dig> instances of hgt with phylogenetic support and identified new instances of transfer into the genome of r. bellii from different bacterial phyla, including firmicutes, nitrospirales, bacteroidetes, and proteobacteria . r. bellii has been previously reported to exchange genes related to amoebal symbionts
 <cit> , and there have been no reported cases of gene loss
 <cit> . the newly introduced genes may be maintained as a consequence of the large size of the r. bellii genome. our phylogenetic analyses also identified four instances of horizontal gene transfer among amoeba-resistant microorganisms . three out of these four instances were among amoebophilus asiasticus 5a <dig> and rickettsia species, and one case was among legionella species and rickettsia species. recently, genes were found to have been transferred between m. avium and l. pneumophila, which have sympatric lifestyles in free-living protozoa
 <cit> . additionally, empirical observations of transferred genes have been described in sympatric population
 <cit> . here, our phylogenetic reconstructions identified possible instances of hgt between the ancestors of rickettsia and the amoeba-parasites. our results support a model in which free-living amoeba act as a “melting pot” for genetic exchange, particularly hgt
 <cit> . in addition to amoeba-resistant bacteria, fungi, giant virus and virophages have been detected in free-living protozoa
 <cit> , which suggests that bacteria living in sympatric populations facilitate more genetic exchange than those living in allopatric populations and that protists can serve as a hot spot for horizontal gene transfer.

we also analyzed instances of hgt from arthropods and their endosymbionts . for example, the gene gi: <dig> was transferred from francisella tularensis species to wolbachia endosymbionts of the culex species . this gene encodes for dihydroneopterin aldolase and participates in folate biosynthesis, which is absent from wolbachia species
 <cit> . other cases include transfers from francisella species to orientia species and to the wolbachia endosymbionts of culex quinquefasciatus pel . francisella-like bacterial endosymbionts were discovered in ticks of the dermacentor family
 <cit> , and this transfer may have been the result of the co-habitation of francisella and other species within the same host. in this work, we identified an instance of hgt from aedes species to two wolbachia strains . this transfer was distinct from the case identified by klasson et al.,
 <cit> , we identified wolbachia as the recipient species and aedes as the donor species, whereas klasson et al. reported a transfer in the opposite direction. our interpretation of this transfer was based on several observations. first, our bayesian phylogenetic tree for gene gi: <dig> had strong bootstrap support  , and the two sequences of wolbachia were affiliated to form a monophyletic group not observed by klasson et al. second, we verified our blast search results for the following  <dig> sequences: gi: <dig> from the wolbachia endosymbiont of drosophila melanogaster; gi: <dig> from the wolbachia endosymbiont of culex quinquefasciatus pel; and gi: <dig> from aedes aegypti. moreover, the two protein sequences from wolbachia demonstrated 62% amino acid identity to each other, but had only 51% amino acid identity to the protein from the aedes species. third, orthologous genes were not found in any other wolbachia species. taken together, we believe that this gene transfers occurred from the insect to the bacterium and that this first wolbachia species may have subsequently transferred the gene to other species. alternatively, the absence of this gene in other wolbachia species may be due to subsequent gene loss. to date, the acquisition of eukaryotic genes by bacteria has rarely been documented. however, a typically eukaryotic glycoside-hydrolase that is necessary for starch breakdown in plants was recently found to have been transferred to bacteria via two successive transfers
 <cit> . moreover, observations supporting large-scale hgt from bacteria, fungi and plants into bdelloid rotifers have been reported
 <cit> . horizontal gene transfers between distantly related organisms, i.e., bacteria and multicellular eukaryotes was thought to occur rarely, but our results demonstrate that these transfers may occur more frequently if they are between species that share the same arthropod host, i.e., ticks or beetles. the evolutionary history of these transfers remains a mystery and required further study. here, we demonstrated two instances of hgt from the wolbachia phage to the wolbachia genome . wolbachia species habor virus-like particles of the phage wo
 <cit> , and in cases of wolbachia-phage transfer, the phage is considered to be the vehicle of transfer via transduction mechanisms rather than the donor species
 <cit> .

in addition, we observed many instances of hgt in candidatus pelagibacter ubique. for example, the gene gi: <dig>  which is involved in translocation activity, was transferred from several different species of gammaproteobacteria, such as shewanella, aeromonas, vibrio, moritella, and photobacterium strains, as well as from arcobacter butzleri rm <dig> of the epsilonproteobacteria. shewanella species are ubiquitous and are present on the north atlantic coast as well as deep in the baltic sea
 <cit> . together with shewanella species, vibrio species occupy various aquatic habitats ranging from the deep sea to shallow coastal marine environments
 <cit> . a phylogenetic tree based on the complete sequences of 16s rdna demonstrated that shewanella species are closely related to marine gammaproteobacteria such as aeromonas, vibrio, photobacterium, pseudoalteromonas, colwellia and psychromonas species
 <cit> . like candidatus pelagibacter ubique, these latter bacteria are marine organisms. evidence of hgt has been reported recently in shewanella species in warm aquatic environments
 <cit> . we also analyzed other cases of hgt in candidatus nitrospira defluvii   and hydra magnipapillata  in aquatic environments, although the mechanism responsible for these transfers is not clearly understood. it has been shown that hgts mediated by gene transfer agents frequently found in marine ecosystems facilitate the adaptation of these microorganisms to new environments
 <cit> . moreover, mobile genetic elements  have been shown to play a crucial role in the expansion of the environmental niches of pathogenic and environmental vibrio species
 <cit> . taken together, we believe that the aquatic environment may play a crucial role in facilitating such transfers in these organisms.

overall, we analyzed a number of instances of hgt from different niches, including free-living protozoa, arthropod hosts and aquatic environments. in addition to the characteristic transfers between different ecological niches, hgts were also analyzed from other origins, including the transfers of genes involved in is <dig> family transposase activity from archaeal species to wolbachia species. the acquisition of this gene may have been the result of massive gene exchange occurring between bacterial and archaeal species
 <cit> . this horizontal gene transfer from different origins revealed a rhizome for rickettsiales genomes
 <cit>  . we also analyzed the functions of novel genes, the origins of which remaine unknown, although previous studies have suggested that these new genes may stem from plasmidic or viral origin
 <cit> .

functional assignment for putative transfers
here, we analyzed putative instances of transfer . only  <dig> % of a total of  <dig>  proteins were assigned specific terms from the gene ontology database. the majority  were assigned terms related to atp catabolic processes, which are used in nucleotide metabolism, and genes involved in the synthesis for nucleotides are completely lacking in rickettsia species
 <cit> . moreover, these translocase enzymes were identified in rickettsia species more closely related to amoeba-symbionts than other rickettsia <cit> . the deficiency of these genes is likely to be linked to the activity of atp/adp translocase  which is used to import atp from the host
 <cit> . this parasitic enzyme may have been duplicated in the chlamydiales ancestor, which may have been transferred to plant and rickettsiae species approximately  <dig>  billion years ago. plant and algae plastids acquired tlc at approximately the same time as parachlamydiaceae and chlamydiaceae diverged
 <cit> , which suggests that such a transfer may have occurred at a time when rickettsiales and chlamydiaceae shared a common protist ancestral host. furthermore, these bacteria may have been facultative intracellular bacteria that shared a common ancestral cell host, such as a free-living amoeba
 <cit> . likewise, it is likely that an ancestor of rickettsia infected an amoeba-like protozoan ancestor and thereby exchanged genes with other symbionts
 <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown recently that r. bellii is able to survive within phagocytic amoeba and can multiply in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells
 <cit> . it has also been reported that rickettsiae species are deficient in tlc, which is a parasite enzyme involved in energy metabolism
 <cit> . rickettsiae acquired tlc from the rickettsiales ancestor and are therefore able to import atp from the host cell, whereas members of anaplasmataceae and orientia subsequently lost this gene
 <cit>  . lacking strong evidence in support of this loss, we therefore can only predict that these proteins may be the result of putative hgt.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed an automated approach for the detection of horizontal gene transfer events that depends on the use of stringent filters. this approach consists of a number of specialized features, including the application of a parsimony method for inferring phyletic patterns followed by a blast filter, automated phylogenetic reconstruction and horizontal gene transfer detection. using this approach, we identified many new instances of transfer into genomes, including those of wolbachia species, anaplasma species, candidatus pelagibacter ubique and other species of rickettsia. the current study provides a systematic pipeline for the automated detection of horizontal gene transfer events from several complete proteomic sequences and therefore can be applied to detect the instances of gens transfer for other genomes of interest. this study also provides i) a global analysis of hgt cases in different ecological niches, including protist and arthropods hosts and aquatic environments, and from diverse origins, such as prokaryotic, eukaryotic, archaeal and viral domains, and ii) gene functions resulting from putative instances of gene transfer. our identification of hgt cases indicative of transfer from different origins allowed us to develop a rhizome for rickettsiales genomes.
