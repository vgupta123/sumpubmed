BACKGROUND
membrane proteins account for roughly one third of all proteins and play a crucial role in processes such as cell-to-cell signaling, transport of ions across membranes, and energy metabolism  <cit> , and are a prime target for therapeutic drugs  <cit> . one important subfamily of membrane proteins are the transmembrane proteins, of which there are two main types:

• α-helical proteins, in which the membrane-spanning regions are made up of α-helices, and

• β-barrel proteins, in which the membrane-spanning regions are made up of β-strands.

β-barrel proteins are found mainly in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, and possibly in eukaryotic organelles such as mitochondria, whereas α-helical proteins are found in eukaryotes and the inner membranes of bacteria  <cit> .

given the obvious biological and medical significance of transmembrane proteins, it is of tremendous practical importance to identify the location of transmembrane segments. there are difficulties with obtaining the three dimensional structure of membrane proteins using experimental techniques:

• membrane proteins have both a hydrophilic part and a hydrophobic part, and hence are not entirely soluble in either aqueous or organic solvents; this makes them difficult to crystallize, and hence difficult to analyze using x-ray crystallography, which requires crystallization of the sample.

• membrane proteins tend to denature upon removal from the membrane, making their three-dimensional structure difficult to analyze.

the difficulty of inferring the secondary or tertiary structure of transmembrane proteins using experimental techniques has led to a surge of interest in applying techniques from machine learning and bioinformatics to infer secondary structure from primary structure in these proteins. these include discriminant analysis  <cit> , decision trees  <cit> , neural networks  <cit> , support vector machines  <cit> , and hidden markov models  <cit> .

another interesting class of proteins are the intrinsically unstructured proteins, proteins that need not be folded into a particular configuration to carry out their function, existing instead as dynamic ensembles in their native state  <cit> . intrinsically unstructured proteins have been associated with a wide range of functions including molecular recognition, molecular assembly/disassembly and protein modification  <cit> .

we are interested in investigating the physicochemical properties of various classes of protein segments. in particular, we are interested in determining which properties are useful for discriminating transmembrane segments from non-transmembrane segments in transmembrane proteins, and for discriminating intrinsically unstructured segments from intrinsically structured segments in transmembrane proteins. we are further interested in any similarities or differences in physicochemical properties across these four classes of segments. we will then apply the results of this analysis to construct classifiers to discriminate transmembrane from non-transmembrane segments in transmembrane proteins.

RESULTS
physicochemical properties
we are interested in determining which physicochemical properties are most useful for discriminating transmembrane segments from non-transmembrane segments in transmembrane proteins, and for discriminating intrinsically unstructured segments from intrinsically structured segments in transmembrane proteins. we are further interested in any similarities or differences in physicochemical properties across these four classes of segments.

certain properties, such as hydropathy and polarity, can be measured in different ways; this results in different scales. we are also interested in determining which scales are the most effective in discriminating transmembrane segments from non-transmembrane segments, and in discriminating intrinsically unstructured from intrinsically structured segments in transmembrane proteins.

our interest is in properties that can be easily computed given only a sequence of amino acids; we therefore considered properties that depend only on the type of each amino acid in a sequence, including:

• hydropathy, a measure of the relative hydrophobicity of an amino acid. there are four hydropathy scales in common use – the kyte-doolittle  <cit> , eisenberg-schwarz-komaromy-wall  <cit> , engelman-steitz-goldman  <cit> , and liu-deber  <cit>  scales.

• polarity, a measure of how charge is distributed over an amino acid, affects how amino acids interact, and helps to determine protein structure. there are two polarity scales in common use—the grantham  <cit>  and the zimmerman-eleizer-simha  <cit>  scales.

• flexibility, a measure of the amount to which an amino acid residue contributes to the flexibility of a protein.

• polarizability, a measure of the extent to which positive and negative charge can be separated in the presence of an applied electric field.

• van der waals volume, a measure of the volume occupied by an amino acid.

• bulkiness, a measure of the volume occupied by an amino acid, is correlated with hydrophobicity  <cit> .

• electronic effects, a measure that takes into account steric factors, inductive effects, resonance effects, and field effects  <cit> .

• helicity, the propensity of an amino acid to contribute to the formation of helical structures in proteins  <cit> .

given a sequence of amino acids, the “pointwise” property value associated to a particular position in the sequence depends only on which of the  <dig> amino acids occurs at that position. to increase the robustness of our results, we work with average property values instead of pointwise property values. the average of a given property associated to a particular amino acid a in the sequence is the average of the pointwise property values associated to the amino acids contained in a window of length l centered at a. the effectiveness of each property at discriminating transmembrane from non-transmembrane segments and intrinsically unstructured from intrinsically structured segments was assessed based on two criteria:

 for a given property x, the degree to which the class-conditional distributions for the two classes overlap, that is, the degree to which px  and px  overlap. the less these two probability distributions overlap, the more easily the two classes can be separated. knowledge of these probability distributions forms the basis for a bayesian classifier, which classifies an instance having a value x for property x to “class 1” if and only if

 pxpx>p{class2}p{class1} 

where p{class 1} is the probability of observing a class  <dig> instance and p{class 2} is the probability of observing a class  <dig> instance. the class-conditional probability distributions for the above properties are plotted in figures  <dig> , <dig> 

 the overlap ratio, defined in the methods section, is a numerical measure of the overlap between the conditional probabilities p{class 1|x = x} and p{class 2|x = x}. the smaller the overlap ratio, the more easily the two classes can be discriminated.

the overlap ratios for discriminating transmembrane from non-transmembrane segments are shown in table  <dig>  while the overlap ratios for discriminating intrinsically unstructured from intrinsically structured segments are shown in table  <dig>  it turns out that the discriminating power of a given property depends on the length l of the window over which property values are averaged; overlap ratios are given in tables  <dig> and  <dig> for all odd values of the window length l between  <dig> and  <dig>

our conclusions were as follows:

• whereas all four hydropathy scales can be used for discriminating transmembrane segments for non-transmembrane segments in transmembrane proteins, the liu-deber scale is the best scale for this task.

• whereas all four hydropathy scales can be used for discriminating intrinsically unstructured segments from intrinsically structured segments in transmembrane proteins, the eisenberg-schwarz-komaromy-wall scale is the best scale for this task.

• whereas both polarity scales can be used for discriminating transmembrane from non-transmembrane segments and for discriminating intrinsically unstructured from intrinsically structured segments in transmembrane proteins, the grantham scale is slightly better for these tasks.

• for both classification problems , flexibility provided some degree of discriminating power, and bulkiness provided still less; neither property was as effective as hydropathy or polarity at discriminating between the two classes.

• for both classification problems, polarizability, van der waals volume, electronic effects, and helicity did not discriminate well between the two classes.

transmembrane segment classifiers
we tested four classification techniques on the problem of discriminating transmembrane segments from non-transmembrane segments in transmembrane proteins:

• c <dig>   <cit> , a decision tree algorithm.

• svmlight version  <dig>    <cit> , a support vector machine algorithm.

• two variants of the self-organizing global ranking  algorithm  <cit> , sogr-i  <cit>  and sogr-ib  <cit> , which are described in detail in the methods section. these algorithms depend on a number of parameters: the length l of the window used to extract features, the number of neurons m, the learning rate ηt, and the neighborhood size r. the performance of these algorithms depends on the choice of these parameters: for example, the performance of the sogr-i algorithm as a function of the length of the window used to extract features is shown in figure  <dig>  based on a series of experiments, we settled on feature window length l of  <dig>  a network size m of  <dig> neurons, a fixed learning rate ηt of . <dig>  and a neighborhood size r of  <dig>  since the length of the window used to extract features was chosen to maximize the performance of the sogr-i algorithm, the results will be slightly biased in favor of the sogr-i and sogr-ib algorithms.

designing a classifier also involves selecting the features that are most useful for the problem of interest. based on our investigations of physicochemical properties, we based the classification on three features:

• hydropathy 

• polarity 

• flexibility

the performance of the above four classification techniques under ten-fold cross-validation when hydropathy , polarity , and flexibility are used as features is shown in table  <dig>  while the performance when only polarity  and flexibility are used as features is shown in table  <dig>  it is interesting that performance drops only slightly when two features are used instead of three. all four classifiers exhibited good performance, with out-of-sample accuracies of approximately 75%. while this may seem low, the substantial overlap of the transmembrane and non-transmembrane classes seen in figures  <dig> , <dig> makes this a nontrivial classification problem. filtering strategies can be used to improve the performance of these classifiers  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we determined that the most useful properties for discriminating transmembrane segments from non-transmembrane segments and for discriminating intrinsically unstructured segments from intrinsically structured segments in transmembrane proteins were hydropathy, polarity, and flexibility, and based on these properties, constructed a number of classifiers to identify transmembrane segments with an out-of-sample accuracy of approximately 75%. several interesting observations emerged from our study:

• intrinsically unstructured segments and transmembrane segments tend to have opposite properties, as summarized in table  <dig>  for example, unstructured segments tended to have a low hydropathy value, whereas transmembrane segments tended to have a high hydropathy value. these results are in agreement with previous work that found that transmembrane segments tend to be more hydrophobic than non-transmembrane segments, due to the fact that transmembrane α-helices require a stretch of 12- <dig> hydrophobic amino acids to span the hydrophobic region inside the membrane  <cit> .

• transmembrane proteins appear to be much richer in intrinsically unstructured segments than other proteins; about 70% of transmembrane proteins contain intrinsically unstructured regions, as compared to about 35% of other proteins.

• in approximately 70% of transmembrane proteins that contain intrinsically unstructured segments, the intrinsically unstructured segments are close to transmembrane segments.

these observations may provide insight into the structural and functional roles that intrinsically unstructured segments play in membrane proteins, and may also aid in the identification of intrinsically unstructured and transmembrane segments from primary protein structure.
