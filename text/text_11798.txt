BACKGROUND
turtles have been characterized for a small number of fascinating differences from the better-studied groups of amniotes, like the regulation of sexual development by temperature and the presence of the carapace. however, little is known about genes involved in the many aspects of turtle development. the development of the eye  <cit> , brain  <cit> , carapace , and gonads ; and the role of specific hormones  have all been briefly studied but these studies have focused on the orthologs of genes already known to have a role in human and mouse development. although the use of studies focused on the turtle orthologs of genes identified in other organisms are clearly important, screens for candidate genes that avoid making a priori assumptions represent a complementary approach with excellent potential to reveal novel developmental genes. this study uses such an approach to identify genes with sexually dimorphic expression; this set of genes is enriched for genes involved in temperature-dependent sex determination , but will also include genes in other aspects of sexual differentiation and general developmental processes related to temperature and hormone regulation that might not be directly related to sexual differentiation.

many reptilian taxa, including the majority of turtle species, exhibit tsd  <cit> . incubation temperature is the initial cue for sexual development in tsd, in contrast to genetic sex determination  that is evident in a number of vertebrate groups such as amphibians, snakes, birds, and mammals  <cit> . gsd is best characterized in therian mammals and is initiated by the sry gene, located on the y chromosome, which causes organisms expressing the gene to develop as males  <cit> . sry orthologs have not been identified in other groups of vertebrates regardless of whether they exhibit tsd or gsd, suggesting that sry is an innovation unique to therian mammals. in fact, only one other unique “trigger” gene for sexual development has been identified in a vertebrate taxon, a fish with gsd . it is unclear whether a trigger gene exists in organisms that exhibit tsd, since there are several models that can explain tsd. for example, tsd may reflect regulation of a trigger gene  by incubation temperature, it may reflect the impact of temperature upon the activity of specific enzymes that have a role in signaling, or it may reflect a combination of both phenomena  <cit> . regardless, it is clear based upon the studies in organisms with known triggers that a gene homologous to a known trigger in other organisms does not regulate tsd in turtles  <cit> .

although trigger gene are not conserved, if one or more are even present, a number of genes involved in gonadal differentiation and other aspects of sexual development are conserved among vertebrates, including organisms with different sex determining systems  <cit> . a number of orthologs of genes first identified in mammals have been identified and characterized in different vertebrate groups  <cit> , including turtles . studies focused on orthologs of genes known to play a role in mammalian sexual development have provided valuable information, although this approach has limits for broader investigations. one setback to an ortholog approach is that the complete set of genes involved in mammalian gsd remains unknown and therefore, it is restricting in finding novel genes or pathways specific to a new system. a complementary approach is to identify candidate genes using patterns of expression rather than orthology. this raises the question of the most appropriate tissue to assay gene expression, since sexually dimorphic gene expression has been noted in multiple tissues  <cit> . thus, focusing on specific tissues may result in the omission of critical candidate genes. the use of whole embryos is an unbiased strategy for finding candidate genes for sex determination, but it also allows for the identification of genes in other pathways that occur within the same time points. also, temperature and hormones do not exclusively affect sex determination, and therefore novel genes can also be identified that are related to temperature and the effects of hormonal exposure.

the goal of this study is to use the red-eared slider turtle , a turtle with tsd, to identify candidate genes within the embryonic development pathway. genes that exhibited a sexually dimorphic expression pattern during the temperature-sensitive period , which contains the critical stage for commitment to a specific sex  <cit> , were targeted. the approach we used will also reveal genes that exhibit a differential expression pattern due to temperature or hormonal differences that are not directly related to sexual development. to accomplish this search we identified genes that show increased mrna accumulation under either the male or female producing temperatures as well as genes that exhibit response to estrogen exposure. since we also examined embryos at various times during the tsp it was also possible to identify stage effects upon mrna accumulation during the tsp. these different searches allow for a broader investigation for not only sexually specific factors but also for general developmental genes previously unknown within the time points of the tsp. to accomplish this, we produced three subtraction libraries. two of these libraries were enriched for genes that show higher mrna accumulation during the tsp in one specific temperature regime . the third library was enriched for genes that show increased mrna accumulation during the tsp in embryos produced at the male-producing temperature after treatment with exogenous estrogen, ultimately producing the female phenotype. subsets of the cdnas from these libraries were examined more thoroughly by macroarray hybridization and semi-quantitative pcr or quantitative real-time pcr. this approach has the potential to identify developmental genes that exhibit differential expression when red-eared slider turtles are exposed to different temperatures and hormonal conditions during the tsp without making a priori assumptions about the identity of the genes.

RESULTS
suppression subtraction hybridization  libraries
ssh was used to construct libraries enriched for cdnas that correspond to mrnas that exhibit different levels of accumulation during the tsp. three subtracted cdna libraries were constructed: one enriched for mrnas that accumulate at higher levels at the female-producing temperature than the male-producing temperature ; another enriched for mrnas that accumulate at higher levels at the male-producing temperature than the female-producing temperature ; and a third enriched for mrnas that accumulate at higher levels at the male-producing temperature with exogenous estradiol-17β  than in similar embryos treated with the vehicle alone . a total of  <dig> sequences were obtained and were previously deposited in dbest . the ssh expressed sequence tags  were processed as described  <cit> , yielding a total of  <dig> contigs and singletons  after assembly using cap <dig>  <cit> . the results for the homology searches can be found in additional file 1: homology search for subtraction libraries.

ssh libraries typically contain some housekeeping genes  <cit>  since it is difficult to completely eliminate genes that do not exhibit differential expression between the two experimental conditions. the quality of ssh libraries can be assessed by examining the proportion of broadly expressed genes, although the most appropriate sets of genes to view as “housekeeping” can be problematic to define precisely  <cit> . however, analyses of gc-content  <cit>  provide a line of evidence that the proportion of cdnas that correspond to housekeeping gene transcripts is greatly reduced in our ssh libraries; housekeeping genes tend to have a higher gc-content than genes that exhibit lower levels of expression  <cit>  and it provides an efficient and practical method to define housekeeping genes that avoids conflicts among the available lists of housekeeping genes. we found that the gc-content of the turtle transcripts was lower than expected for other reptilian est efforts  <cit> . thus, the ssh method did appear to enrich for genes with lower levels of mrna accumulation despite being unable, as expected, to eliminate all housekeeping gene cdnas.

genes found in the ssh libraries
genemerge was used to test for over-represented go  terms signifying biological processes from genes with human homologs found in all three ssh libraries  <cit>  . a total of  <dig> over-represented go terms were significant  and they represent a broad range of biological processes. a few umbrella categories that include a number of over-represented go terms are anatomical structure morphogenesis , cellular processing , and metabolic processing . these categories show that the genes found in the ssh libraries involve active cell differentiation and processing, as expected for mrnas expressed in developing embryos.

in addition, genes that have human homologs from the ssh libraries were clustered into functionally related groups within the subset of biological processes by the david tool for functional annotation clustering with high stringency  <cit>  . the different groups represent the diversity of the libraries’ genes. a pertinent cluster to our study that emerged is one enriched for genes involved in developmental processes . though these genes are identified as being associated with human developmental processes, this study offers a chance to determine if they have been co-opted for similar functions in the turtle. one of the genes from this cluster mmp <dig>  starred in figure  <dig>  is of particular interest because it is one of the first mis -target genes involved in müllerian duct regression and is involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodelling  <cit> . mmp2’s involvement in mammalian development leads us to believe it has potential to be a candidate gene for relevant to the aspects of turtle development that represented the focus of this study, potentially including tsd.

a number of distinct genes  in the ssh libraries encode temperature responsive proteins or regulatory genes involved in the heat shock response. ten temperature responsive cdnas were found in the female library  whereas only one of each was found in the male and e <dig> libraries . since the female library was enriched for genes expressed at a temperature 5°c higher than either the male or the e <dig> libraries the larger number of heat shock cdnas could simply reflect a temperature effect. however, specific temperature responsive mrnas accumulate differentially during gonadal differentiation in another reptile with tsd . furthermore, specific heat shock proteins play a critical role in the transcriptional complex of steroid hormone receptors and their corresponding chaperones and cofactors  <cit> . given that temperature is the initial signal in tsd, temperature responsive genes represent good candidates for involvement in the tsd cascade.

differential expression revealed by macroarray analyses
a macroarray assay was used to refine the set of genes identified by sequencing the ssh libraries for sexual dimorphism and place our analysis of transcript accumulation under different experimental conditions in a quantitative framework . a total of  <dig> signals were detected as having differential expression patterns:  <dig> female biased signals and  <dig> male biased signals. however, the degree of differential expression revealed by the macroarray analyses was typically <2-fold. thus, our macroarray analyses were able to show that a number of cdnas present in the ssh libraries do exhibit sexual dimorphic patterns of expression under the conditions we tested, although the differences in the amount of mrna present was typically limited. since our experiments were conducted on whole embryos to ensure unbiased candidate gene identification, it might be the case that some genes identified exhibit stronger sexual dimorphism in a specific tissue or a subset of tissues . however, our results indicate that sexually dimorphic gene expression is detectable at the whole embryo level, indicating that the unbiased approach is feasible.

genes that are found to be sexually dimorphic are not automatically considered to be part of tsd since differing temperatures and hormones can affect more than just sexual development. the genes that emerged from the macroarray as being differentially expressed have a mixture of biological roles in humans based on david. some genes overlap in their biological roles while others have more distinct roles. for example,  <dig> genes  are involved in the regulation of metabolic processing and  <dig> genes  are involved in cell division and proliferation . moreover, afp and laptm4a are involved in reproduction and transport, respectively. though these genes are not directly related to human sexual development, they provide us with a clue as to which types of processes occur during turtle development under different temperatures and hormone exposures.

semi quantitative  pcr validation of tsd candidate genes
further experiments for validation were conducted on a subset of candidate genes selected from both the subtraction library and macroarray analyses. these genes were chosen because they were implicated in mammalian sexual development , mammalian development , or have an unknown function . the five candidate genes were used in three different categories for semiq-pcr: sexual dimorphic expression at stage  <dig>  differences between stages  <dig> and  <dig>  and an e <dig> time trial conducted during stage  <dig> including fast  and slow  responses .

only the turtle ortholog of c16orf <dig>  a gene of unknown function, showed evidence of sexually dimorphic expression at stage  <dig>  the transcript of this gene showed greater accumulation in males than in females , the same trend that was evident in the macroarray results. it is conserved in mammals, birds, fish, insects, nematodes, and plants, its go term is integral to membrane, and it is found in a wide variety of adult and embryonic tissues in mammals  <cit> . since c16orf <dig> is a gene of unknown function and it was found to be sexually dimorphic in turtle embryos during the tsp, it represents truly a novel candidate for a gene involved in turtle development, potentially including tsd; and potentially in sexual development in other vertebrates as well.

four genes exhibited increased accumulation during stage  <dig> relative to stage  <dig> in embryos incubated at the male producing temperature . this stage effect was evident for c16orf <dig>  cct <dig>  mmp <dig>  and nfib ; the most striking is a ~8-fold increase in mrna accumulation between stage  <dig> and  <dig> for c16orf <dig>  the others showed a range of relative increase in mrna accumulation of  <dig> -fold to  <dig> -fold with stage progression. cct <dig>  mmp <dig>  and nfib have been implicated in gonad development  or other aspects of development  in mammals. when this information is combined with our observation that turtle orthologs exhibited increased mrna accumulation as development proceeded from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig>  it is reasonable to speculate that these genes play a role in turtle development, potentially sexual development in the case of mmp <dig>  though notch <dig> does not show a stage effect for turtle it has been previously seen as a developmental gene in neuronal development of a mammal and might have a more significant affect on turtle development during different stages or the stage differences are too low to identify with this study  <cit> .

all five genes show a rapid  response to e <dig> exposure. c16orf <dig>  cct <dig>  and mmp <dig> all show a downregulation of mrna expression and nfib and notch <dig> show an upregulation. four of the genes  exhibited similar mrna accumulation both  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours after e <dig> exposure; accumulation of the c16orf <dig> mrna almost returned to pre-exposure levels after  <dig> hours. mmp <dig> is affected by e <dig> based upon previous studies whereas the impact of e <dig> exposure upon mrna accumulation for other genes has not been examined. mahmoodzadeh et al.  <cit>  showed that e <dig> inhibits mmp <dig> gene expression in rat fibroblasts and those results corroborate our findings for mmp2’s involvement with e <dig> 

expression of a long noncoding rna  is sexually-dimorphic
a number of cdnas on the macroarray  could not be identified using blastx, suggesting that they correspond either to cdnas for which only untranslated region was included in the est read or noncoding rnas . to identify some of these cdnas we conducted blastn searches and revealed that one of the cdnas that exhibits sexual dimorphism is a ncrna, malat <dig> 

malat <dig> is a long  ncrna that undergoes a cleavage that produces two rnas, a smaller trna-like cytoplasmic rna  and a  <dig>  kb rna that localize to two different subcellular compartments, cytoplasm and nuclear speckles respectively  <cit> . characteristically, it has short blocks of high conservation across the entire transcript, especially in 3’ half of rna, and lacks repetitive elements except for a sine and line element near its 5’ end  <cit> . the smaller  transcript generated by cleavage is highly conserved across many species, including mouse, human, dog, lizard, frog, and stickleback. it has not yet been found in any of the four available sequenced bird genomes . there are two possible explanations:  birds lost the locus or  it is located in a region that was consistently underrepresented in all of the available avian genome assemblies  <cit> . both explanations are plausible since gene loss is known to be an important process during evolution  <cit>  but the avian genome assemblies  are incomplete.

malat <dig> shows a broad distribution of expression in normal human and mouse tissues but its misregulation is correlated with the progression of cancers and it is upregulated in many human carcinomas  <cit> . more importantly for this study, malat <dig> accumulation is higher in adult mammalian ovaries than adult testes  <cit> . however, the pattern of differential expression for malat <dig> in adult mammalian gonads is distinct from the pattern we observed using the macroarray assay, in which the mrna accumulation appeared  <dig> -fold higher in whole male turtle embryos. since malat <dig> is a ncrna that shows dimorphic expression in the tsp we felt it was an excellent candidate for a gene involved in tsd so we used quantitative real-time pcr  to verify the pattern of expression suggested by the macroarray.

we used qrt-pcr to examine malat <dig> rna accumulation because it represents a rigorous test of differential expression. malat <dig> rna accumulation was examined independently for multiple individuals  and the two stages during the tsp  rather than using pooled samples. this analysis revealed a slight but significant sexual dimorphism  in the amount of malat <dig> rna during both stages we examined . malat <dig> rna expression also shows a modest increase as development progresses from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig> in both males and females. these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that malat <dig> plays a role in turtle tsd.

CONCLUSIONS
here we reported a survey of genes identified based upon their patterns of mrna accumulation during embryonic development in the red-eared slider turtle. we used a non-ortholog based strategy and identified four genes that exhibited increased mrna expression as development proceeded from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig>  a set of genes that responded to e <dig> exposure, and two genes  that show greater accumulation at the male producing temperature than at the female producing temperature. this survey focused on changes in mrna accumulation in whole embryos. thus, it remains possible that some or all of these genes exhibit even more strongly dimorphic expression in specific tissues . moreover, the genes we identified are likely to be significant since screening for differential expression at the whole embryo level is expected to be a conservative way to examine gene expression during development.

mmps  are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrices in physiological processes, including cancer  <cit> . mmp <dig> is sexually dimorphic in developing male mice because it functions as a paracrine death factor in müllerian duct regression downstream of the mis cascade  <cit> . in addition, kim et al.  <dig>  <cit>  found mmp <dig> to be sexually dimorphic and regulated by testosterone in songbirds in relation to the vocal control center during adult neurogenesis. furthermore, estrogen affects the mmp pathway in humans by increasing mmp <dig> enzymatic activity  <cit> . it is unclear if the increase in mmp <dig> is through an increase in mrna accumulation or through other mechanisms, such as binding affinity changes. though mmp <dig> was not found to be sexually dimorphic in turtles it was found to be inhibited by e <dig>  the opposite of the regulation in mammals but potentially similar to birds  <cit> . together with the prior knowledge of its involvement in mammalian and avian development, mmp <dig> is a novel candidate gene for development in the turtle.

ncrnas are believed to play a large number of biological roles , but their role in development remains poorly characterized  <cit> . although there is some evidence that ncrnas have roles in sexual development in both mammals  <cit>  and birds  <cit> , this is the first evidence that a ncrna may have a role in sexual development for an organism with tsd. this hypothesis is corroborated by the fact that malat <dig> exhibits differential expression in mammalian gonads . however, the pattern of sexual dimorphism reported for mammals is distinct from that evident in turtles . our findings highlight the importance of examining ncrnas when investigating vertebrate development in general and sexual development specifically.

little is known about the genes involved in turtle development, including the processes related to tsd, regardless of whether they are protein-coding genes or ncrnas. much of the information available is focused on the examination of the turtle orthologs of genes involved in mammalian development. the limitations on this type of an examination are exemplified by our novel results of two genes  that show sexual dimorphism during tsp. these two types of genes are novel to turtle sexual development because one is a ncrna , not typically found in sexual differentiation in other vertebrates, and the other  is of unknown function. our results highlight the need to diverge from focusing only on protein-coding genes when looking for developmental genes and to expand into the more diverse world of rna in general, specifically including ncrnas.
