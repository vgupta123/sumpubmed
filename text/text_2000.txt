BACKGROUND
non-typhoidal serovars of salmonella enterica subspecies enterica are responsible for outbreaks and sporadic occurrences of gastrointestinal illness that result in significant human morbidity worldwide  <cit> . human salmonellosis in north america is attributed primarily to s. enterica serovars typhimurium and enteritidis, with other serovars that vary in regional prevalence constituting the remainder  <cit> . due to the high incidence of s. typhimurium and s. enteritidis, serotyping alone is not sufficient to establish the chain of transmission from putative animal, environmental or food sources to human cases. serotyping in combination with other more discriminatory methods such as phage typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , dna sequence-based typing , comparative genomic hybridizations  or plasmid profiling may provide useful subtyping information. for example, serotyping has been used in combination with pfge to successfully link s. enterica isolates recovered from agri-food products to outbreak-associated cases of human salmonellosis  <cit> .

s. heidelberg is a member of salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serogroup b and is highly prevalent in both canada and the united states, but is infrequently reported in european countries  <cit> . in canada, s. heidelberg consistently ranks with s. enteriditis and s. typhimurium as one of the top three most prevalent causes of human salmonellosis, accounting for between 12–20% of human clinical salmonella isolates reported annually between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . s. heidelberg is also one of the most common salmonella serovars isolated from broiler chickens and egg laying flocks in canada and accordingly outbreaks of human s. heidelberg infections have been associated with consumption of contaminated poultry products including chicken, chicken nuggets and eggs  <cit> . other modes of transmission such as person-to-person spread or direct contact with infected animals have rarely been reported  <cit> .

the canadian integrated program for antimicrobial resistance surveillance was established by the public health agency of canada  in  <dig>  cipars collects information regarding antimicrobial resistance trends amongst enteric pathogens isolated from human clinical specimens, livestock and retail meat sources to assess the human health risk associated with the use of antimicrobials in food animal production. cipars has noted that s. heidelberg was frequently isolated from poultry sources, with this serovar accounting for 72% of all salmonella isolates recovered from retail chicken in  <dig>  <cit> . in addition, there has been an increase in resistance to multiple antibiotics, particularly extended spectrum cephalosporins , amongst s. heidelberg isolates from human and agri-food sources  <cit> .

in this study, the genetic relationship between s. heidelberg isolates from retail chicken, abattoir chicken ceca and chicken, cattle, swine and human clinical samples was examined using a variety of molecular methods. our goal was to identify variable genetic traits that would support the investigation of potential linkages between human multi-drug resistant  s. heidelberg isolates and mdr s. heidelberg in chicken agri-food sources.

RESULTS
genetic variation due to chromosomal determinants
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  is frequently used to subtype salmonella  <cit>  and has previously been used to link cases of human salmonellosis with contaminated agri-food products  <cit> . a comparison of pfge data for all  <dig> s. heidelberg isolates submitted by cipars to pulsenet canada from  <dig> to  <dig> for pfge analyses was retrospectively performed. pfge identified limited genetic diversity amongst these human and non-human isolates originating from  <dig> provinces, as 61% of isolates were indistinguishable by xbai and blni pfge . an additional 15% of the isolates differed from pattern shexai. <dig> by 1– <dig> fragments and therefore meet the criteria of being closely related to this restriction pattern  <cit> . the lack of genetic diversity observed using pfge therefore makes this method unsuitable for identification of epidemiological links between human and agri-food isolates. thus a subset of up to  <dig> strains  representing a diverse range of temporally and geographically distinct s. heidelberg isolates with different pfge types, sources, sites of isolation, phage types and resistance phenotypes were selected for examination by additional subtyping methods.

dna sequence-based typing  was conducted on s. heidelberg strains using a previously published scheme examining the fima, manb, and mdh loci. this sbt scheme has previously been shown to distinguish amongst some salmonella isolates of the same serovar, including s. agona and s. typhimurium  <cit> . ten s. heidelberg isolates were selected from human, chicken, turkey and bovine sources  for examination by sbt . no nucleotide polymorphisms were observed amongst  <dig> bp sequenced from each of these strains therefore the application of this method offered no additional discrimination.

comparative genomic hybridization  between s. heidelberg genomic preparations  and a dna microarray based upon s. typhimurium lt <dig> was used to attempt to identify variable regions or traits between s. heidelberg strains that were not detected by either pfge or sbt. the cgh data indicated that there were several bacteriophage-related determinants that were putatively divergent or absent amongst all of the s. heidelberg isolates in reference to s. typhimurium lt <dig> . these included the fels- <dig>  fels- <dig> and gifsy- <dig> prophage genes, which is an observation similar to previous cgh studies that demonstrated variable carriage of prophage genes amongst salmonella serovars  <cit> . comparison of the cgh patterns between s. heidelberg isolates identified limited strain-to-strain variation between isolates, with the exception of stm0691–stm <dig> . the flda, miab, pote and furr loci encoded in this putatively divergent region were amplified and sequenced from  <dig> s. heidelberg isolates  however, no nucleotide polymorphisms were observed throughout these gene sequences . these data indicated that the minimal strain-to-strain differences identified by cgh may actually be due to experimental variation rather than actual biological differences. in addition, the limited genomic diversity between s. heidelberg isolates identified by this microarray-based method may be representative of the true level of diversity, however, the lack of s. heidelberg specific sequences on the array may have prevented the ability to distinguish between isolates. in the absence of a sequenced s. heidelberg genome, cgh studies based on a s. heidelberg-specific microarray platform are not currently possible.

resistance determinants
resistance phenotypes were determined by minimum inhibitory concentration  <cit>  testing . the isolates were then screened by pcr to determine the corresponding genotypes and to examine whether the resistance genotypes of isolates could be indicative of the isolate source . all s. heidelberg isolates that exhibited an esc resistance phenotype were pcr positive for the blacmy- <dig> gene, with the exception of a single bovine isolate . the blacmy- <dig> gene was also responsible for the esc resistance phenotype of five e. coli isolates included in the study to represent other sources of esc resistance determinants disseminating in the agri-food continuum along with s. heidelberg. the dna sequence of the blacmy- <dig> gene was identical amongst all of the s. heidelberg isolates and the five e. coli.

tetracycline resistance was mediated by a combination of teta and tetb genes in s. heidelberg and solely teta in e. coli . chloramphenicol resistance was mediated by aadb, cmla, flor and streptomycin resistance was mediated by stra alone or in combination with either aada <dig> or aada <dig> or both. trimethoprim resistance was mediated by the dhfra <dig> gene. sulfizoxazole/sulfamethoxazole resistance was mediated by the sul <dig> gene in  <dig> of  <dig> s. heidelberg isolates. the gene mediating sulfizoxazole/sulfamethoxazole resistance in the remaining  <dig> isolates was not identified. the carriage of the sul <dig> genes by isolates indicated the possible presence of class i integrons  <cit> . accordingly, class i integrons could be amplified from  <dig> s. heidelberg and  <dig> e. coli isolates . the s. heidelberg integron amplicons were either  <dig>  or  <dig>  kbp and dna sequencing identified several resistance determinants carried within the variable region of the integrons in addition to sul <dig> carried within the 3' conserved segment . the integron amplified from strain 02– <dig> could not be successfully sequenced. identical integrons encoding the dhfra <dig> trimethoprim resistance determinant were amplified from 02– <dig> and 05– <dig>  three e. coli isolates carried identical class i integrons encoding aada <dig>  notably, no class i integrons were amplified from chicken agri-food isolates indicating that these isolates have acquired resistance determinants by other mechanisms.

b no hmw plasmids were observed in this strain

c hmw plasmids were observed, but could not be isolated from this strain after transformation attempts

genetic variation attributable to the carriage of plasmids
the genetic diversity between isolates examined by pfge, sbt and cgh was limited at chromosomal determinants thus no genetic traits suitable for use in source tracking could be identified. however, different resistance determinants and integrons were observed therefore the plasmid content of the isolates was determined to examine another possible source of genetic variation. the total plasmid content amongst sensitive isolates and isolates resistant to one or more antimicrobial varied due to the carriage of two high molecular weight  plasmids: one common to all strains and a larger plasmid present only in esc resistant strains. the common plasmid may represent the hmw virulence plasmid that has been described in other s. enterica subsp enterica serovars  <cit> , however, the virulence determinants spv, pefa and rck were not detected in the s. heidelberg strains by pcr . one or more low molecular weight  plasmids ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kbp were also observed in each strain regardless of resistance phenotype .

isolation of plasmids mediating cephalosporin resistance was achieved by electroporating the total plasmid preparation from individual esc resistant isolates into one shot® top <dig> electrocomp™ e. coli cells. transformant colonies containing esc resistance determinants were selected with cefoxitin and the blacmy- <dig> gene was amplified by pcr from all of the transformant strains. transformant colonies could not be obtained using plasmid dna preparations from strains 02– <dig> and 05– <dig>  of the two hmw plasmids originally observed in the s. heidelberg strains, only the larger plasmid was isolated from all cefoxitin resistant transformants. restriction fragment length polymorphism  analyses were performed on the resistance plasmids using bglii to determine genetic relatedness . the presence of the blacmy- <dig> gene on this hmw plasmid  was confirmed by southern blot of the rflp fragments. the blacmy- <dig> gene could be localized to the largest rflp  fragment in all isolates with the exception of two human blood isolates . the  <dig>  kbp and  <dig>  kbp integrons encoded by isolates 02– <dig> and 03– <dig> respectively, were localized to the blacmy- <dig> hmw plasmid by screening the blacmy- <dig> transformant colonies by pcr and by southern blot of the rflp fragments . the integron amplified from isolates 05– <dig>  01– <dig> and 02– <dig> could not be localized to the blacmy- <dig> hmw plasmid because the plasmid could not successfully be isolated from these strains or they did not harbour hmw plasmids .

the blacmy- <dig> plasmids extracted from e. coli transformants exhibited diverse rflp patterns  suggesting that multiple plasmid backbones were involved in the emergence of esc in s. heidelberg. notably, isolates from different sources  had identical rflp patterns. identical rflp patterns were also obtained from s. heidelberg 05– <dig> and e. coli  <dig> indicating that blacmy- <dig> plasmids are successfully transferred between species. the horizontal transfer of blacmy- <dig> plasmids between bacterial species and the transfer of the blacmy- <dig> gene between plasmid backbones limits the utility of plasmid characterizations to discern the epidemiologic relationships amongst isolates. rflp analyses were also performed on the full plasmid preparations from s. heidelberg sensitive and resistant s. heidelberg isolates to characterize the hmw plasmid common to all s. heidelberg isolates . restriction fragments of the common plasmid in the sensitive strains corresponded to fragments in the resistant strains indicating that these plasmids are similar between isolates.

replicon typing schemes have recently been hypothesized to be a more accurate method of determining plasmid relationships than rflp  <cit> . we investigated the ability of a pcr-based replicon typing scheme to supplement plasmid rflp data. two different replicons, repa/c and repi <dig>  were identified for the blacmy- <dig> plasmids by screening the blacmy- <dig> transformants . these plasmids were also screened by pcr and southern blot for individual resistance determinants. all  <dig> blacmy- <dig> plasmids isolated from  <dig> s. heidelberg and  <dig> e. coli that encoded a repa/c replicon also encoded multi drug resistance  . the presence of repa/c blacmy- <dig> plasmids that carry resistance cassettes have also been identified amongst s. typhimurium isolates  <cit> . the class i integrons localized to the blacmy- <dig> plasmid demonstrated a mechanism for the generation of mdr. the repa/c plasmids had diverse rflp patterns compared to the repi <dig> plasmids further indicating the mosaic nature of these plasmids. the repa/c were unable to be transferred by conjugation to the recipient e. coli strain rg <dig> with the exception of 03– <dig> that was conjugative.

the majority of the blacmy- <dig> plasmids isolated from both s. heidelberg and e. coli were shown to carry repi <dig> replicons and only the blacmy- <dig> resistance gene was detected by pcr and southern blot . all repi <dig> plasmids tested successfully transferred by conjugation to a recipient e. coli strain with the exception of 04– <dig>  the conjugative ability of repi <dig> plasmids can help explain their widespread presence amongst the s. heidelberg isolates. a single chicken-passive isolate was shown to carry both the repa/c and repi <dig> replicons along with the blacmy- <dig>  stra, and flor resistance determinants. three plasmids encoding only the blacmy- <dig> resistance determinant did not encode either the repa/c or repi <dig> replicons. the repa/c mdr plasmids were isolated from human-clinical and both chicken and porcine samples, and similarly, the repi <dig> plasmids were isolated from diverse sources, therefore replicon typing could not be used to establish a link between human illness and a particular agri-food s. heidelberg source.

CONCLUSIONS
there was limited genetic diversity at the chromosomal level amongst the s. heidelberg isolates. plasmid content exhibited strain-to-strain variation and was responsible for differences in antimicrobial susceptibility between isolates. no suitable genetic trait was identified to permit source tracking of human s. heidelberg infections. however, the paucity of s. heidelberg in other agri-food sources such as pigs or cows indicates that chicken agri-food products are the most likely source of human salmonellosis among the commodities surveyed by cipars  <cit> . s. heidelberg is also frequent in clinical turkey samples  <cit> , but cipars does not currently routinely survey salmonella in turkey at the abattoir or retail level and the frequency of s. heidelberg in healthy turkey is unknown. it is therefore possible that if the main reservoir for s. heidelberg is poultry, amongst this population of strains there is in fact limited overall genetic diversity and no experimental method will identify epidemiologically significant genetic traits.

in addition, this study demonstrates the elements responsible for esc resistance and mdr in s. heidelberg. esc resistance of s. heidelberg isolates could be attributed to the carriage of blacmy- <dig> on hmw resistance plasmids and other resistance determinants were localized to integrons. two resistance plasmids were observed: repa/c non-conjugative hmw plasmids encoding esc resistance in combination with other resistance determinants, and conjugative repi <dig> plasmids encoded solely esc resistance.
