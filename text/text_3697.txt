BACKGROUND
the melon  is an important vegetable crop grown in temperate, subtropical and tropical regions worldwide. the melon belongs to the cucurbitaceae family, which also comprises other vegetable crops such as cucumber, watermelon, pumpkin and squash, and whose economic importance among vegetable crops is second only to solanaceae. c. melo is a diploid species  with an estimated haploid genome size of  <dig> mb  <cit> . in recent years, extensive research has been performed in melon to elucidate fruit ripening processes, carotene accumulation and aroma production  <cit> . in addition, genomic approaches to melon breeding have been successfully applied to the molecular characterisation of important agronomic traits, such as pathogen resistance  <cit>  and sex determination  <cit> . recent research has increased the availability of genetic and genomic resources for melon  <cit> , such as the sequencing of ests  <cit> , the development of an oligonucleotide-based microarray  <cit> , the construction of bac libraries  <cit> , the production of mutant collections for tilling analyses  <cit> , the development of a collection of near-isogenic lines   <cit> , the construction of several genetic maps  <cit>  and the development of a genetically anchored bac-based physical map  <cit> .

the melonomics project, aimed at sequencing the complete melon genome using a whole-genome shotgun strategy, was recently initiated by a spanish consortium  <cit> . determination of the complete melon genome also includes sequencing of the chloroplast  and mitochondrial  genomes. as of  <dig> june  <dig>  the ncbi databases contain  <dig> eukaryota plastid genome records  <cit> . comparative studies have indicated that the chloroplast genomes of land plants are highly conserved in both gene order and gene content and are moderately sized, between  <dig> and  <dig> kb  <cit> . in contrast, plant mitochondrial genomes range from  <dig> to  <dig>  kb in size, which is at least  <dig> to  <dig> times the size of typical animal mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . cucurbitaceae possess the largest known plant mitochondrial genomes; however, species that belong to the same genera within cucurbitaceae and have similar nuclear genome sizes show great size differences in their mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . experimental procedures based on kinetic reassociation rate measurements have predicted a melon mitochondrial genome of  <dig>  kb, the largest one among plants and animals and comparable in size to the genomes of many free-living bacteria  <cit> . recently, the mitochondrial genomes of citrullus lanatus   and cucurbita pepo   have been determined  <cit> . sequence analysis of these mitochondrial dnas has suggested that the increased genome size in this family reflects an accumulation of chloroplast-derived and short repeated sequences, whereas protein-coding regions are conserved across these species, with minor exceptions  <cit> . in general terms, dna transfer from organellar genomes to nuclear dna, and vice versa, appears to be a common phenomenon associated with the redistribution of genetic material between nuclear and organellar genomes  <cit> . furthermore, a reduction in organelle dna content is linked to a gradual loss of the genetic autonomy of organelles  <cit> .

next-generation sequencing platforms are rapidly changing the field of genomics, allowing both re-sequencing and de novo sequencing of whole genomes with a significant reduction in cost and time relative to conventional approaches. nevertheless, only a few examples of plastid genome next-generation sequencing have been published so far and no plant mitochondrial genome has been sequenced that way  <cit> . in this article, we report the complete sequence of the melon chloroplast genome obtained from bac end sequences , and we report an estimated 95% of the melon mitochondrial genome determined using roche- <dig> sequencing technology. with a size over  <dig>  mb, the mitochondrial genome of melon represents the largest mitochondrial genome sequenced so far. data on the structure and content of both organellar genomes and a comparison to published cucumber chloroplast and watermelon and squash mitochondrial genomes are presented.

RESULTS
organisation of the cucumis melo chloroplast genome
the complete nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast genome of melon  was determined . the genome was  <dig>  bp long and included a pair of inverted repeats  of  <dig>  bp separated by small  and large  single-copy regions of  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp, respectively . the gc content was found to be  <dig> %, which is identical to that of cucumber, the only other reported cucurbit chloroplast genome  <cit> , and to other sequenced plant chloroplast genomes.

the melon chloroplast genome contains  <dig> genes, including  <dig> single-copy genes and  <dig> duplicated in ir regions . the gene-coding regions accounted for  <dig> % of the genome and included  <dig> protein-coding genes and  <dig> conserved orfs,  <dig> rrna genes and  <dig> trna genes, which represented  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total sequence, respectively; cis-spliced introns accounted for  <dig> % of the genome. the genes clpp, rps <dig> and ycf <dig> contained two introns, while  <dig> additional genes contained one intron each. the rps <dig> gene was found to undergo trans-splicing, with the 5' exon located in the lsc region and the other two exons located in both ir regions.

the border sequences between the ir, lsc and ssc regions vary among different species. the pattern in melon is similar to that in cucumber, as described in  <cit> . in particular, ira extended  <dig>  bp into the ycf <dig> gene, and the irb/ssc border was within the coding regions of the ycf1-like and ndhf genes, which overlap by  <dig> bp. the ira/lsc border was located downstream of the trnh-gug gene, whereas the ψrps <dig> gene, present in that region in other species such as arabidopsis thaliana, was absent in both melon and cucumber. finally, the irb/ssc border extended  <dig> bp into the 5' coding region of the rps <dig> gene, as in cucumber.

the melon chloroplast genome was screened for simple sequence repeats , which resulted in the identification of  <dig> microsatellites that were at least  <dig> nt in length  or contained at least four tandem repeat units . all the microsatellites found were shorter than  <dig> bp. ssrs accounted for  <dig> bp  of the total sequence, which was similar to the ssr content estimated for the melon nuclear genome  <cit> . the poly/poly microsatellite was the only mononucleotide repeat found and represented  <dig> % of all ssrs found.

comparison of the cucumber and melon chloroplast genomes
as of today, the chloroplast genome of only one cucurbit species, cucumis sativus , has been published  <cit> . previous studies have suggested that sequence analysis of chloroplast genes can be a valuable tool for phylogenetic studies among closely related species  <cit> . accordingly, and due to the highly polymorphic nature of the cucurbitaceae family, a comparison of the melon and cucumber chloroplast genomes can provide useful information about the evolutionary relationships among cucurbit species.

the chloroplast genome sequence of the c. sativus 'chipper' line  was compared to the melon genomic sequence reported here. the cucumber genome was  <dig> bp shorter than the melon genome, but overall only approximately 5% of the nucleotide sequences were different, mainly due to indels and snps . deletions in the melon sequence, compared to cucumber, were found at  <dig> loci and represented  <dig>  bp, or  <dig> % of the cucumber genome. eighty-five percent of the deletions involved the loss of less than  <dig> bp, while five deletions represented the loss of  <dig> to  <dig> bp. insertions in the melon sequence as compared to cucumber were found at  <dig> loci representing  <dig>  bp. seventy-one percent of these insertions involved the gain of less than  <dig> bp; six insertions of  <dig> to  <dig> bp were also found. additionally, we identified  <dig>  snps, which represented  <dig> % of the melon sequence.

6highly divergent regions found between the melons at coordinates  <dig>  and  <dig> 

recombination mechanisms between direct repeat sequences on the ssc/ir border regions have been found to be responsible for the expansion/contraction of the ir sequences, which can create large sequence variations in chloroplast genomes  <cit> . significantly, the area of highest diversity between the compared genomes was found in the region located between the melon sequence coordinates  <dig>  and  <dig> , close to the ssc/ira border. in particular, eight highly polymorphic regions with a total length of  <dig> bp were found in this region .

an additional comparison between the amino acid sequences of the melon and the cucumber chloroplast-encoded proteins was performed, and the results are shown in additional file  <dig> table s <dig>  except for orf <dig> and the ycf1-like gene the annotation of both species contained the same set of orfs. nevertheless, the published cucumber sequence contains orfs homologous to those of melon orf <dig> and ycf <dig> 

when the predicted protein sequences were blasted against the non-redundant genbank database, cucumber was identified as the highest-scoring plant species for  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted coding genes . with the exception of the rpl <dig> and accd genes, which had identity values of 91% and 82%, respectively, the rest of the  <dig> genes showed identity values higher than 95% when compared to their cucumber homologues.

five out of nine genes whose highest-scoring match was not cucumber showed protein identities higher than 96%, although the identity values, when compared to their cucumber homologues, were also high . finally, the predicted proteins with lower identity to other plant chloroplast proteins were those encoded by the clpp, ycf <dig> and, particularly, both the ycf <dig> and ycf1-like genes.

organisation of the cucumis melo mitochondrial genome
after the isolation of intact mitochondrial organelles from young melon leaves, mtdna was extracted and sequenced using the roche- <dig> technology, and the  <dig>  resulting reads were assembled as described in the methods section. bes from two different bac libraries  <cit>  and whole genome sequences derived from  <dig> sequencing of 3-kb, 8-kb and 20-kb paired-end  libraries  were also used to improve the genome assembly.

the resulting sequence amounts to  <dig>  mb distributed in five scaffolds of lengths  <dig> , <dig> bp,  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp and four additional unscaffolded contigs that totalled  <dig>  bp. . the overall sequence coverage is 18-fold. the size of the melon mitochondrial genome has previously been estimated to be approximately  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb  <cit> . based on this estimate, we can assume that 95% of the mitochondrial genome has been assembled and that 84% of the genome is contained in a single scaffold. failure to assemble all the reads in a single circular sequence can be attributed to the high degree of repetitive sequences found in this genome, as will be discussed later. however, the existence of several subgenomic molecules that coexist inside the mitochondria, as has been described in other species  <cit> , cannot be ruled out. the contig and scaffold sequences have been deposited in genbank under accession numbers jf <dig> to jf <dig>

the gc content of the mitochondrial genome was found to be  <dig> %, which is higher than that of the chloroplast and nuclear melon genomes and similar to the estimated gc content of the watermelon and squash mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . annotation of the sequence was performed, and  <dig> genes were detected . gene-coding regions accounted for  <dig> % of the genome  and included  <dig> protein-coding genes and  <dig> conserved orfs,  <dig> rrna genes and  <dig> trna genes, which represented  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total sequence, respectively; cis-spliced introns accounted for  <dig> % of the genome. the genes nad <dig>  cox <dig>  ccmfc, rpl <dig>  rps <dig> and rps <dig> contained one intron, nad <dig> contained three introns, and nad <dig>  nad <dig> and nad <dig> contained four introns each. the nad <dig>  nad <dig> and nad <dig> genes were found to undergo trans-splicing.

as of  <dig> june  <dig>  the mitochondrial genome sequences of  <dig> streptophyta have been deposited in genbank  <cit> , including two cucurbit species: c. lanatus  and c. pepo . genes homologous to all the predicted protein-coding genes from the watermelon and squash mitochondrial genomes have been found in the annotated melon sequence, with the exception of the rps <dig> gene. however, it is already known that this gene has been lost from the mitochondrial genome in diverse species due to transfer to the nucleus; in particular, cucumber, which is phylogenetically closer to melon than both watermelon and squash, has apparently recently lost this gene  <cit> . apart from the loss of the rps <dig> gene, some differences were found regarding the number of trna genes in the three cucurbit genomes. for example, while two trnq genes, two trnc genes and one trnk gene were found in watermelon, only one trnq gene and no trnc or trnk genes were present in melon. however, it is well known that even phylogenetically related species differ substantially in their trna complement set .

when the predicted protein sequences were blasted against the non-redundant genbank database, cucurbits were identified as the highest-scoring plant species in only  <dig> of all  <dig> predicted coding genes . this is in sharp contrast to the chloroplast sequences discussed above, in which the majority of melon proteins displayed the highest identity values when compared to their cucumber homologues. the identity values of the  <dig> proteins ranged from 78%  to 99% . however, rna editing events, which are known to frequently alter mitochondrial transcripts, have not been identified in melon except for a limited number of cases. therefore, the actual identity values are expected to be somewhat higher than our estimated values. twenty out of  <dig> genes whose highest-scoring match was not a cucurbit species showed protein identities higher than 90% for the corresponding best hits. finally, the predicted proteins with lower identity to other plant mitochondrial proteins are those encoded by sdh <dig>  ccmfn, rps <dig>  rps <dig> and, particularly, orf <dig>  orf <dig> and rps <dig> 

for gene distribution along the mitochondrial chromosome, several small syntenic clusters are found when the melon, watermelon and squash mitochondrial sequences are compared . however, as has been described for watermelon and squash, the distribution of these clusters reveals a high level of genomic shuffling and rearrangement between these three species  <cit> .

analysis of repetitive dna, chloroplast and nuclear-derived dna
although the gene content of melon is highly similar to that of watermelon or squash, the melon mitochondrial genome size is thrice that of squash and as much as seven times that of watermelon. in fact, regions of dna as large as  <dig> kb could be found that contained no protein-coding genes. figure  <dig> shows a schematic representation of the gene density of the largest scaffold .

to establish the fraction of this huge genome that is shared with the other two cucurbit mitochondrial genomes, all three sequences were cross-compared using blastn. it has been previously reported that processes such as nuclear or chloroplast dna transfer to the mitochondria and internal recombination of the mitochondrial genome lead to a high degree of sequence rearrangement that can obscure any trace of homology over time  <cit> . for this reason, a less conservative e-value of 1e- <dig> was chosen for the comparative analysis. as a result,  <dig> kb  and  <dig> kb  of the watermelon and squash mitochondrial genomes, respectively, were found to be homologous with the melon sequence. in addition, 73% of these homologous regions  were shared among all three species. seventy-nine regions longer than  <dig> bp accounted for 60% of the total homologous sequence . these figures are in accordance with the generally accepted theory of watermelon being phylogenetically closer to melon than to squash.

the conserved mitochondrial-like sequence was found to contain all the predicted orfs except for orf <dig> and orf <dig> , and so it can be concluded that the approximately  <dig> kb of conserved sequence  represented a core cucurbit mitochondrial genome present in all three sequenced genomes. also, the finding that approximately 27% of the conserved melon and watermelon regions were not conserved in squash, and vice versa, points to independent events that have directed the evolution of these three genomes from a common cucurbit ancestor. in any case, the previous data showed that 95% of the melon mitochondrial genome had no homology whatsoever with the mitochondrial sequences of other cucurbits.

previous reports have indicated that small, repetitive dnas contribute significantly to the expanded mitochondrial genome of cucumber, which is estimated to be  <dig>  mb  <cit> . therefore, the presence of ssrs, transposable elements, inverted repeat regions and tandem and direct repeats was analysed. the mitochondrial sequence contains  <dig> ssrs  that amounts to  <dig>  bp . all the microsatellites were shorter than  <dig> bp, except for a  <dig>  this value is ten times lower than the estimated ssr content of the melon nuclear genome  <cit> . in comparison, the squash and watermelon mitochondrial genomes contain one ssr every  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively . therefore, microsatellites represent an insignificant portion of the melon mitochondrial genome and cannot explain its large size. the presence of transposon-related sequences was also investigated, but only small fragments that totalled  <dig>  bp  were found to show homology to transposable elements . the search for inverted repeat sequences  produced  <dig> pairs of irs, which amounted to  <dig>  bp . percent matches between irs were higher than 70%, with  <dig> pairs of irs showing values higher than 95%. the average repeat length was  <dig> bp; the longest ir found was  <dig>  bp. in comparison, the ir contents of watermelon and squash were also calculated, but only  <dig> irs  and  <dig> irs  were found in those species, which is between four and nine times lower than the melon ir content. therefore, the melon mitochondrial genome was significantly enriched in sequences that can mediate recombination events.

regarding the tandem repeat content of the sequenced genome, the analyzed sequence contained  <dig> tandem repeats, which amounted to  <dig>  bp or  <dig> % of the available sequence. the average period size and period copy number were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the most abundant type of tandem repeats were those with period sizes of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which totalled 40% of all tandem repeats found and 56% of the tandem distributed sequence. as a comparison, the tandem repeat contents of watermelon and squash were also calculated, and  <dig> repeats  and  <dig> repeats , respectively, were found. therefore, while the relative tandem repeat contents of melon and squash were similar, watermelon showed a significantly reduced tandem repeat content in its mitochondrial genome.

additionally, the maximal repeat content and repeat families of the mitochondrial genomes of watermelon, squash and melon were calculated using two different programs . the repeatscout program, which detects repeats larger than  <dig> bp and excludes low complexity sequences, predicted  <dig> repeat families  in melon,  <dig> families  in squash and  <dig> families  in watermelon. the most abundant repeat families for the compared mitochondria consisted of  <dig> copies of approximately 120-bp-long repeats for melon and  <dig> copies of approximately 173-bp-long repeats for squash. only  <dig> repeats were found to be longer than the average read length, which is  <dig> nt. incidentally, the fact that the most abundant repetitions are shorter than the average  <dig> read length implies that, in those cases, the  <dig> reads extends the repetitions and result in the correct assembly of reads. therefore, although the existence of mis-assemblies of repetitive sequences cannot be completely rule out, mis-assemblies probably affect our proposed sequence to a much lower degree that could be guessed based only on the high repeat content of the genome.

we also searched for exact repeats longer than  <dig> bp using reputer . similar to the findings reported for squash  <cit> , we found a significant content of short repeats in the mitochondrion of melon. our numbers for squash and watermelon were slightly lower compared to data obtained in  <cit>  because we looked only for exact repeats, but the differences among the genomes analysed are clear. the mitochondrion of melon is much richer in large repeats than that of squash.

chloroplast-derived dna accounts for as much as 9% of sequenced plant mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . the melon chloroplast genome described above was used to identify mitochondrial sequences of putative chloroplast origin. in all,  <dig> mitochondrial regions that ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp  and totalled  <dig>  kb or  <dig> % of the mitochondrial genome, showed homology with the melon chloroplast sequence. on the other hand,  <dig> kb or 35% of the melon chloroplast genome showed homology to the mitochondrial genome. the  <dig>  kb difference in the chloroplast-derived mitochondrial sequence was due to duplicated regions in the chloroplast genome. as a comparison, watermelon's mitochondrion contains  <dig> kb of chloroplast-like sequences, while squash's mitochondrion contains  <dig> kb, which represents approximately 80% of other sequenced cucurbit chloroplast genomes such as those of melon and cucumber. therefore, no correlation seems to exist between the mitochondrial sizes of these three species and their chloroplast-derived sequence content.

finally, nuclear-derived sequences have been detected in several plant mitochondrial genomes and amount to up to 7% of their size  <cit> . in watermelon and squash, approximately  <dig> kb of nuclear-like sequences, most of which resemble retrotransposable elements, have been found. although the contribution of retrotransposons to the expanded melon mitochondrial genome is negligible, as discussed above, the blasting of  <dig> mb of the melon nuclear genome draft sequence obtained in our laboratories  against the mitochondrial sequence produced  <dig>  mitochondrial regions that ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  bp and that totalled  <dig> , <dig> bp . significantly, even when only the  <dig> homologous fragments longer than  <dig> kb were considered, more than 33% of the available mitochondrial sequence still showed homology with melon nuclear regions. the analysis of those  <dig> mitochondrial homologous regions longer than  <dig> kb and totalling ca.  <dig> kb showed that the average identity between the mitochondrial and nuclear regions was 91% with values ranging from  <dig> to 96%. the detailed analysis of two of these regions with lengths  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp and identities of 94% and 89% relative to their nuclear counterparts, showed a transition/transversion mutation ratio of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, with cmit → tnuc and gmit → anuc the most abundant mutations found, and cmit → anuc the most representative transversion mutations. twenty-seven indels totalling  <dig> nt and five gaps of between  <dig> and  <dig> nt were also found.

interestingly, all  <dig> regions analyzed but three displayed high levels of sequence identity with at least two different nuclear regions, therefore suggesting a relationship between the repetitive nuclear dna and the mitochondrial dna of putative nuclear origin.

a large fraction of the mitochondrial gene-containing regions and some chloroplast-like regions in the mitochondria showed homology with the nuclear sequence, as was expected because many mitochondrial genes have homologous counterparts in the nuclear genome. also, dna transfer from the chloroplast to the mitochondrion has been known to occur. when these regions were not considered,  <dig>  mb of mitochondrial sequence still showed homology to nuclear sequences. in all, nearly half of the melon mitochondrial genome seemed to be of nuclear origin; therefore, the transfer of dna from the nucleus can, at least partially, explain the large size of this mitochondrial genome. however, the nature of approximately  <dig>  mb of mitochondrial sequence remains to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
whereas the size and gene organisation of the chloroplast genome were similar among cucurbit species, the mitochondrial genomes showed a wide variety of sizes, with a non-conserved structure both in gene number and organisation, as well as in the features of the noncoding dna; nevertheless, we identified a minimum cucurbit genome core of  <dig> kb between melon, watermelon and squash with a high level of nucleotide sequence conservation. in addition to a high proportion of repetitive dna content in melon, compared to watermelon and squash, the transfer of nuclear dna to the melon mitochondrial genome seems to explain the size of the largest mitochondrial genome reported so far.
