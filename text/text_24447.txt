BACKGROUND
the development of hybrid crops with improved yield characteristics is vital to meet the food needs of an increasing world population, assure sustainable land practices and contribute to ongoing conservation efforts. hybrid rice has enabled china to reduce the total land used for planting from  <dig>  mha in  <dig> to  <dig>  mha in  <dig>  while increasing production from  <dig> to  <dig> million tons  <cit> . production of hybrid seeds in self-pollinating crop species requires the use of male-sterile plants. cytoplasmic male sterility  is most commonly employed in developing such hybrids. cms is a maternally-inherited trait that leads to failure in the production of viable pollen.  <cit>  suggested it is the result of incompatible nuclear and mitochondrial functional interactions. despite the existence of a number of different types of cms systems, two key features are shared:  cms is associated with the expression of chimeric mitochondrial open reading frames ; and  fertility restoration is often associated with genes thought to regulate the expression of genes encoded by organellar genomes; for example, pentatricopeptide repeat  proteins involved in processing organellar rnas  <cit> . in many cases, including rice, nuclear-encoded fertility restorer  gene can restore male fertility. consequently, sterility results from mitochondrial genes causing cytoplasmic dysfunction and fertility restoration relies on nuclear genes that suppress cytoplasmic dysfunction.

in almost all plant cms systems studied to date, the male sterility trait was associated with changes in mitochondrial gene organization.  <cit>  demonstrated that cytoplasmic male sterility was caused by protein defects involved in mitochondrial energy production and often involved atp synthase subunit genes. therefore, impaired atp synthase activity could be a causal factor in disrupted pollen function. in several cases, mt-dna rearrangement has been shown to generate novel chimeric orfs, which resulted in the expression of novel polypeptides  <cit> . often, these chimeric orfs were adjacent to normal mitochondrial genes and sometimes the rearrangements resulted in the deletion of genuine mitochondrial genes  <cit> . to date, more than  <dig> genes associated with cms have been identified in the mitochondria of a variety of plant species  <cit> . the sequences that contribute to the generation of the chimeric orfs are typically derived from coding and noncoding regions of existing genes, but are occasionally from unknown origins. in most cases, impairment of functions of mitochondrial genes have been shown to be associated with cms  <cit> . however, the precise relationship between mitochondrial cms-associated genes and male sterility varies from species to species and is poorly understood.

a unique feature of plant mitochondrial gene expression is rna editing, first detected by  <cit> . generally, changes in the primary transcript involve c to u transitions by cytosine deamination. the editing process can change the amino acids that are encoded by mrna, and also introduce new start and stop codons. editing is essential to generate operative gene products . the functional relevance of plant mitochondrial rna editing is high, as it results in the production of conserved polypeptides. in the presence of rna editing, in some cases mature proteins are quite different in size, amino acid composition and function from that predicted in the genomic dna sequence  <cit> .

commercially cultivated hybrid rice includes three-line and two-line hybrid rice developed through cytoplasmic male-sterility and photo/thermo-sensitive male sterility   <cit> , respectively. furthermore, various types of cms systems have been identified in rice, i.e., cms-wa, cms-hl and cms-bt. currently, the cms-wa  system derived from the wild species oryza rufipogon griff  <cit>  is applied most often for hybrid rice production  <cit> . rice breeders tend to employ the cms-wa preferentially as it gives stable cms lines, restorers are frequently found and there is no indication of its genetic vulnerability to disease. however, the uniformity of the wa cytoplasm can result in genetic vulnerability to disease and insect pests. to overcome this, it is essential that the genetic source of cms be diversified. additionally, cms requires the development and maintenance of separate male and female  gene pools. generally, only a subset of the female genotypes contains the genetic information required to reliably confer the desired phenotype. the female gene pools are often less diverse than the male gene pools, therefore the genetic diversity of the hybrid cultivars depends largely on variation in the male genotypes. this has been a major constraint for plant breeders. thus, understanding the molecular basis of cms in rice wa-cytoplasm is critical if improvements in rice hybrid seed production technology are to continue. the present study served to elucidate the molecular mechanisms conferring cytoplasmic male sterility in the wa system of cms rice. our initial investigation in the cms-wa system evaluated the structural organization of certain mitochondrial genes that were previously implicated in cms in various plant species, including atpa, atp <dig>  atp <dig> and orfb. here we provide experimental evidence for polymorphisms in atp <dig> and orfb structural organization and mitochondrial transcript profiles of the orfb gene in the cms-wa rice system. the sterile line orfb gene transcript profile was characterized by two transcripts of ~ <dig>  kb and ~ <dig>  kb, and one ~ <dig>  kb transcript was detected in the fertile lines. the ~ <dig>  kb transcript present in the sterile line remained unedited. however, in the presence of nuclear encoded restoration of fertility  gene in fertile restored hybrid lines , the ~ <dig>  kb orfb transcripts were fully edited. the editing of the orfb gene ~ <dig>  kb transcript co-segregated with fertility restoring alleles in a segregating population of f <dig> progeny of restored hybrid f <dig> plants.

RESULTS
structural organization of atp <dig>  atpa, atp <dig> and orfb in sterile and fertile rice lines
the organization of four mitochondrion-encoded genes was examined by southern blot analysis of the cms rice line apms-6a, including the corresponding maintainer apms-6b and restorer br- <dig> lines. the analysis was conducted with mitochondrial genomic dna. however, it was determined that analysis of total cellular dna of each experimental line revealed the same restriction fragment length polymorphism  pattern as mitochondrial dna with respect to the mt-genes under consideration. restriction fragment length polymorphisms were not observed for atp <dig> or atpa in any of the three rice lines apms-6a, apms-6b, and br- <dig> . the atp <dig> probe hybridized to a single restriction fragment  with all five restriction enzymes, indicating the existence of a single copy of the gene. the atpa gene exhibited the same results, with the exception of bglii, where the atpa probe detected a  <dig>  kb and  <dig> kb fragment in all three lines  due to the presence of a bglii site within the  <dig> bp probe sequence. however, rflps were detected in the atp <dig> gene between the apms-6a, apms-6b and br- <dig> lines . the sterile lines contained a single band, whereas the fertile maintainer and restorer lines showed two hybridizing bands each for all five restriction enzymes. scai exhibited an additional  <dig>  kb fragment hybridized to the partial atp <dig> coding region probe in the maintainer rice line. a polymorphism was also evident when the atp <dig> 3'-untranslated region  was used as a probe . additionally, rflps were observed for the orfb gene  in the mitochondrial genome between the sterile and the fertile lines. all restriction enzymes with the exception of ecori gave rise to a single hybridizing band with size variation between the sterile and fertile lines. due to the presence of an ecori site in the orfb gene probe, digestion with ecori consistently generated two bands in all rice lines. the length of one band varied between the sterile and the fertile lines. therefore, it was evident that mitochondrial orfb gene was present as a single copy with differential organization in the sterile and fertile lines. this was based on observations that with the exception of ecori, all restriction enzymes gave rise to single hybridizing bands of variable sizes in fertile and sterile rice lines. the results of the southern blot analysis are represented in supplementary . additionally, rflps were also tested for mitochondrial atp <dig> and orfb genes in ecori digested mitochondrial dna of cms-wa ir58025a , ir58025b  and the restorer  lines . the band patterns were exactly similar to observations made in case of the apms6a/b and restorer lines. furthermore, the mitochondrial dna of a non wa-cms system in rice, kalinga 32a/b lines, was also tested for rflp studies with atp <dig> and orfb genes. in this case, no dna band polymorphism was observed .

transcription profile of polymorphic atp <dig> and orfb genes
mitochondrial rna northern blot analysis from sterile, maintainer and restorer rice lines was performed to determine if dna polymorphisms in the atp <dig> and orfb gene loci resulted in changes in expression profiles for these two genes . radiolabelled probes for the respective genes were generated for carrying out the evaluation. a single ~ <dig>  kb transcript was detected for the atp <dig> gene in both sterile and fertile lines . thus, the atp <dig> gene expression was not influenced due to the dna polymorphism as observed between the atp <dig> loci in sterile and fertile mitochondria. in contrast, differences in orfb gene transcripts were observed between the wa sterile and fertile maintainer and restorer lines. the orfb probe detected a single ~ <dig>  kb transcript in the male-fertile maintainer and restorer lines, whereas in the wa sterile line, a transcript of ~ <dig>  kb with a relatively lower intensity was observed in addition to the major ~ <dig>  kb orfb transcript . northern blot analysis with strand-specific probes confirmed that all transcripts from each genotype were of the same polarity .

editing of the orfb transcripts
 the fertile line
mitochondrial rna editing of the orfb transcript was assessed in the fertile rice line. fourteen cdna clones obtained from cdna library of fertile rice line were sequenced. determination of the orfb cdna sequence from overlapping clones from the cdna library showed four c→t conversions within the coding region relative to the orfb genomic sequence. two editing events within the coding region affected the second position in a codon , and another event changed the first position . these three editing events altered the coding properties of the affected triplets, which led to major changes in amino acids . furthermore, editing at nucleotide position  <dig> in the coding region of orfb disrupted an xhoi restriction site . the fourth substitution was at the third position of a codon for leucine and was silent . results showed that all four sites within the coding region were edited in all  <dig> clones. this indicated highly efficient and consistent mitochondrial editing for this transcript in the fertile rice line.

 the sterile line
orfb cdna sequences were determined from overlapping clones of the cdna library from the sterile rice line. twelve orfb cdna clones were completely sequenced. the size of the inserts ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp. analysis of the clones revealed that they comprised sequences that overlapped with each other and were homologous to the nucleotide sequence of orfb cdna from the fertile line . however, in contrast to the cdna clones from the fertile line, unedited as well as edited cdna clones were obtained from the sterile line. the edited clones exhibited identical editing to the cdna clones in the fertile line. interestingly, however, in the clone with the largest insert  editing was absent. sequence analysis also indicated the insert contained a portion of the 5' utr region of the orfb gene, not detected in  <dig>  kb orfb gene transcripts of the fertile lines. it was therefore inferred that the clone contained an insert originating from the long  <dig>  kb transcript of the orfb gene. furthermore, an additional interesting clone  of  <dig> bp was detected. it contained three unedited sites; unlike the other two clones that contained one unedited site out of four, normally found edited within the orfb gene coding sequence . observing that some of the orfb gene transcripts in the sterile line remain unedited appeared significant.

orfb transcripts of the sterile line have identical 3' ends with that of transcripts from the fertile lines
the basis of the observed differences in the orfb gene transcripts between the sterile and fertile lines was determined using 3' race. the forward primer o-gsp <dig>  annealed  <dig> bp downstream of the initiation codon in the coding region of the orfb gene. in both the fertile and sterile rice lines, one amplified band of ~ <dig> bp was obtained . all the amplified products from the sterile and fertile lines were cloned into the puc <dig> vector. more than  <dig> clones were randomly selected and sequenced. it was confirmed by hybridization with the orfb cds gene probe that all clones contained the desired insert . fertile line sequencing revealed all clones were edited, whereas in the sterile line, both edited and unedited clones were observed. all clones from fertile and sterile lines contained a  <dig> bp 3' utr in addition to the partial cds region. thus, the edited and unedited orfb transcripts from the sterile and fertile genotypes were 3' co-terminal and terminated  <dig> bp downstream of the translation termination codon taa.

orfb transcripts have differential 5' utr regions in fertile and sterile lines
characterization of the orfb transcript 5' upstream region of the sterile and fertile rice lines was performed by mitochondrial cdna 5' race using the corf primer. the primer annealed  <dig> bp downstream of the initiation codon. two bands of approximately ~ <dig> bp and ~ <dig> bp were generated in the sterile apms-6a rice line . one ~ <dig> bp product was observed in the fertile br- <dig> rice line . pcr products were individually cloned into puc <dig>  positive clones were identified for sequencing by hybridization with the orfb cds probe. random sequencing of  <dig> clones of ~ <dig> bp pcr products from the sterile rice line revealed a 5' utr of  <dig> bp in addition to the  <dig> bp partial cds. sequencing of  <dig> clones of ~ <dig> bp 5' race product revealed a 5' utr of  <dig> bp in addition to the  <dig> bp partial cds. the clones with the longer 5' utr were unedited, as was evident from the sequence of the  <dig> bp fragment of the coding region, where as the clones with the shorter 5' utr were edited. in case of the fertile rice line, sequencing of  <dig> clones obtained with the ~ <dig> bp 5' race product revealed orfb transcripts with a 5' utr of  <dig> bp only. they were completely edited.

sequence analysis showed that, despite the larger size of the unedited transcript, the coding region was identical to that of the smaller edited transcript, with the exception of four single nucleotide changes that arose from editing. the  <dig> bp 5' utr sequence of the ~ <dig>  kb transcript was identical to the rice mitochondrial genomic sequence . the entire edited ~ <dig>  kb and unedited ~ <dig>  kb orfb gene transcript sequences are shown in figure  <dig> 

following assembly of the partial sequences obtained from the cdna library, 3' race and 5' race experiments, the entire ~ <dig>  kb and ~ <dig>  kb transcript sequences were deciphered. to test the accuracy of the ~ <dig>  kb specific sequence, a northern blot analysis was performed with mitochondrial rna from sterile and fertile restorer rice lines . the 5' genomic dna upstream of the ~ <dig>  kb transcript sequence was chosen as the radiolabelled probe. the fragment was pcr amplified using the primer set mtg- <dig> and orfb-utr . a ~ <dig>  kb fragment was detected in the sterile line but not in the restorer rice line . it should be noted that in the sterile line, northern blot analysis using orfb cds as the probe generated both ~ <dig>  kb and ~ <dig>  kb bands; while the fertile restorer rice line revealed only the ~ <dig>  kb transcript. therefore, this result confirmed the extensive 5' utr belonged to the ~ <dig>  kb transcript.

rt-pcr analysis reveals that the ~ <dig>  kb transcript does not undergo editing in sterile rice lines
the rna editing status of the ~ <dig>  kb transcript was evaluated in the sterile rice line . rt-pcr analysis was performed using the 5' gene specific primer mtg- <dig>  and 3' gene specific primer corf  . the mtg- <dig> primer annealed only to the longer ~ <dig>  kb transcript. rt-pcr generated a band of ~ <dig> bp ; maintainer and restorer rice lines do not possess the ~ <dig>  kb transcript; consequently amplification was absent . twenty randomly selected clones from this rt-pcr product were sequenced and revealed the presence of only unedited clones. sequencing could aid in detection, as three editing sites fell within the partial cds region chosen for rt-pcr amplification. it was therefore evident that ~ <dig>  kb transcript remained essentially unedited in the wa-sterile rice line.

transcript profile of the orfb gene in maintained hybrid  and restored hybrid  lines
the influence of the nuclear encoded rf alleles on transcription of the orfb gene was tested in two types of f <dig> plants, sexual hybrids apms-6a × apms-6b  and apms-6a × br- <dig> . pollen produced by the restored f <dig>  plants was viable. however, pollen produced by the f <dig>  plants was sterile. northern blot analysis of mt-rna of both types of f <dig> plants was carried out with the radiolabelled cds region of the orfb gene as the probe. northern blot analysis  revealed the presence of two bands, a ~ <dig>  kb and a longer ~ <dig>  kb band in the maintainer and restorer f <dig> plants. subsequently, the orfb gene coding region was isolated from both hybrid lines by rt-pcr. amplification with the orfb-5' and orfb-3' gene-specific primers produced a  <dig> bp product for both hybrid lines . thirty-two clones of the maintainer f <dig> plants were randomly selected and sequenced and provided evidence for the presence of edited and unedited sequences. about  <dig> % of the clones were edited, while the remaining  <dig> % were unedited. however, sequence analysis of an equal number of clones in restorer f <dig>  plants revealed the presence of only edited sequences. this indicated the ~ <dig>  kb orfb transcripts experienced editing under the influence of the rf gene present in the restorer line.

the longer ~ <dig>  kb orfb transcript of wa-cytoplasm remains unedited in the absence of nuclear encoded restoration of fertility  alleles
in order to test the influence of the nuclear encoded fertility  restorer alleles on the editing of the ~ <dig>  kb orfb gene transcript, a separate rt-pcr experiment was conducted. the maintainer f <dig> sterile plants and the fertility restorer f <dig> plants were subjected to rt-pcr analysis using the 5' gene specific mtg- <dig> and the 3' gene specific corf primers . the ~ <dig> bp rt-pcr products were cloned and for maintainer and restorer plants,  <dig> randomly selected clones were sequenced. the results showed the presence of only unedited clones in the maintainer sterile lines but the restorer hybrids exhibited edited clones.

the edited phenotype of ~ <dig>  kb orfb transcript co-segregates with the restoration of fertility  alleles
one hundred sixty-two f <dig> progeny from the apms-6a × br- <dig> cross were raised in the field in summer  <dig>  a screening for male-sterile plants on the basis of pollen fertility among the f <dig> progeny resulted in identification of two sterile segregant plants . the two sterile plants and the randomly selected two fertile plants among the  <dig> f <dig> segregant progeny were subjected to rt-pcr analysis. the orfb gene coding region was investigated using orfb-5' and orfb-3' gene specific primers. in all f <dig> plants,  <dig> bp products were amplified via pcr . both edited and unedited clones were found in the two sterile plants, whereas only edited clones were detected in the two fertile plants. subsequently, in a repetitive experiment,  <dig> f <dig> progeny plants of the same cross combination were raised in summer  <dig>  to screen for sterile segregant plants. three sterile plants were identified among the  <dig> plants. thereafter, the  <dig> sterile plants  and  <dig> randomly selected fertile plants from f <dig> population of the  <dig> season were subjected to rt-pcr analysis using the mtg- <dig> and corf primers. the ~ <dig> bp rt-pcr products  were cloned and randomly selected  <dig> clones from each plant line were sequenced. only unedited clones were found in all the f <dig> sterile plants. in case of  <dig> fertile plants, on the contrary, only edited clones could be found in all cases of  <dig> clones analyzed. thus, the results provided a case for the presence of a strong correlation between non-editing of the orfb ~ <dig>  kb transcript and the sporophytic male sterility phenotype in the cms-wa system.

inheritance pattern of restoration of fertility trait amongst f <dig> progenies
the f <dig> progenies of a cross made between apms-6a × br- <dig> in  <dig> were raised in  <dig> and also in  <dig> cropping season. a search was made to identify individual plants with sterile pollen amongst the segregating plant population for restoration of fertility genes/alleles. in  <dig>  there were  <dig> sterile plants out of  <dig> plants scored. in  <dig>  likewise,  <dig> plants with sterile pollen could be found amongst  <dig> plants. based on the past information that the restoration of fertility nuclear genes  are located in chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> of the rice genome, the segregation pattern of the restoration of fertility genes in the present case was studied. the observation of each season was subjected to chi-square test hoping for the rf genes to assort independently into the gametes. in the present case, there were two phenotypic classes, viz., plants with fertile pollen and plants with sterile pollen. the frequency of appearance of sterile plants from this particular cross combination was too low to fit in dihybrid pattern of epistatic gene interaction . however, the observed number of segregation of two phenotypic classes fitted well with trihybrid cross ratio of 63: <dig> as per chi-square test, when epistatic gene interaction could be operative . the chi-square test result indicated that the experimental data provided no statistically compelling argument against this hypothesis.

discussion
previous rflp analyses in several plant species have provided evidence for mt-dna genome organizational differences between cytoplasmic male-sterile and male-fertile lines. in some cases, these differences helped to identify genetic elements responsible for the cms trait  <cit> . in the present study, similar analysis of rice mt-dna with wa-cms cytoplasm revealed variations associated with the atp <dig>  and orfb  loci in the sterile and fertile rice lines. the orfb gene, although present as single copy in sterile and fertile lines, exhibited polymorphisms in its structural organization. in addition, the orfb gene exhibited a differential transcript profile in the sterile lines relative to the fertile rice lines. northern blot analysis revealed two, one ~ <dig>  kb and another ~ <dig>  kb sized orfb transcripts in the sterile lines; but only the ~ <dig>  kb transcript was detected in the fertile lines . the ~ <dig>  kb transcript in the sterile lines was characterized by a  <dig> bp 5'utr, which is notably shorter in the ~ <dig>  kb transcript; both transcripts possess identical  <dig> bp 3' utr regions. this indicates the larger transcript was likely transcribed from a different 5' initiation site located upstream of the gene. alternatively, it could have arisen from an independent transcription initiation event. this would have been driven by an alternative promoter, located upstream of the promoter that normally drives expression due to a rearrangement in the mitochondrial genome.  <cit>  reported the presence of multiple promoters driving expression of the maize cox <dig> gene. promoter multiplicity has a marked influence on transcript complexity. however, an explanation for the generation of a longer orfb transcript in sterile lines is yet to be offered.  <cit>  reported the presence of several structural variations between the wa-genome compared to fertile lines, and the mitochondrial expression profile between the genomes showed differential expression of only two mrnas.

interestingly however, the orfb gene cds remains identical in both transcripts with the exception of four single nucleotide changes due to rna editing. furthermore, in wa-cms the ~ <dig>  kb transcripts do not undergo editing. as a result, both edited and unedited orfb gene transcripts are formed in the sterile line. alternatively, the fertile line is characterized by the presence of only edited transcripts. these changes  could be functionally significant with respect to orfb gene function. among these changes, nucleotide position  <dig>  which corresponds to the 20th amino acid, is highly conserved in plants and is located within the transmembrane helix of orfb, as predicted by the sosui program .

the orfb gene cds in rice with wa cytoplasm was found to be identical to the cds of japonica rice . the cds from the wa cytoplasm rice line was also found to be homologous to the atp <dig> gene in other monocot species, for example, approximately 95% homologous to the atp <dig> gene in wheat ; 96% homologous to the atp <dig> gene in sorghum ; and 94% homologous to the atp <dig> gene in corn  . however, substantial divergence  between rice atp <dig> genes and dicot species has been reported, for example,  <dig> % homology in beta vulgaris ; and  <dig> % in daucus carota . the orfb gene nucleotide sequence is also completely identical to the orf <dig> mitochondrial gene sequence of wheat  <cit> . the similarity of wheat orf <dig> to rice orfb gene transcripts extends further in that the editing takes place at the same four positions of the cds, corresponding to three amino acid substitutions and one silent modification. wheat orf <dig> encodes a polypeptide of  <dig> kda that is associated with mitochondrial membrane function  <cit> . this is congruent with former suggestions that most cms-associated mechanisms operative in plants follow a common comprehensive approach  <cit> . the observed transcript changes of orfb gene may not only be the result of the environment of the mitochondrial genome, but can also be affected by dominant nuclear genes  <cit> . orfb gene transcript profile analysis of f <dig> plants, derived from sexual crosses between cms plants  and isonuclear maintainer lines , and between cms plants  and restorer lines  provided experimental evidence that ~ <dig>  kb transcripts of the orfb gene undergo editing under the influence of the nuclear encoded fertility restorer  alleles. the ~ <dig>  kb orfb transcript remained unedited in male-sterile lines. in maintainer and restorer hybrid plant lines, the two orfb transcripts were present; but the ~ <dig>  kb transcript was edited in the restorer hybrid lines. this is significant as we know in plants where the seed is harvested, it is imperative that the f <dig> hybrid be male fertile. thus, the fundamental characteristics of cms in rice have a bearing on this requirement. differences in transcript profiles between cms and fertile lines in the presence of fertility restorer genes have been observed in sunflower  <cit> .  <cit>  reported that the b-atp <dig> gene transcript pattern, associated with cms-bt rice carrying cms-bo cytoplasm, was altered in the presence of the nuclear rf- <dig> gene. the b-atp <dig> gene was transcribed into a  <dig>  kb rna in the absence of the rf- <dig> gene, but into two discontinuous rnas  in the presence of the rf- <dig> gene. in the present case, however, restoration of fertility does not lead to any change in the transcript profile of the orfb gene.

despite the fact that some rf loci are known to affect the transcript profile of cms associated loci in several plant species, how the altered expression of rf genes/alleles influence fertility restoration is not known  <cit> . in rice many pentatricopeptide repeat  gene allele are present, unlike wheat, maize and sorghum  <cit> . many of these ppr genes are clustered in chromosomal regions  <cit> , similar to radish and petunia. as the ppr clusters in rice genotypes are consistent with their chromosomal locations, it has been deduced that variations in the number of ppr gene/allele members and existence of null members in such clusters may exist in different genotypes of rice  <cit> . in such a situation, it is suspected that some of the members of ppr clusters function in collective manner as fertility restorers with distinct functional role to perform in a cms system. functional variations between a series of restoring  alleles and nonrestoring  alleles are speculated to exist between genotypes including restorer lines in rice  <cit> . it was speculated in the past based on genetic data that the fertility of cms-wa is controlled by one or two pairs of restorer alleles corresponding to different restorer lines  <cit> ; and they function in an independent fashion in various restorer lines  <cit> . based on this, it has generally been believed that in cms-wa, two rice fertility restorer genes are required for the production of viable pollen. these genes have been mapped to chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . however, segregation analysis of a f <dig> population for fertility restoration and genotyping using molecular markers revealed that fertility restoration in wa-system is controlled by more than two loci; one on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  one on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  one on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> and an unknown rf gene  <cit> . the location of the rf gene remains unknown. thus, it can be hypothesized that in the presence of different restoring  genes/alleles, differential epistatic influence on male sterility/fertility is operative. how ppr proteins regulate the restoration process remains, however elusive.

in most cases, fertility restoration is attained through nuclear-encoded rf-gene-dependent mitochondrial rna modification and concurrent reduction of the cms-associated protein. the nature of the rf genes that affect mitochondrial gene expression has long been considered a black box. earlier studies have indicated the possible roles of restorer gene on editing rice atp <dig> transcripts in cms-bt  <cit>  and sorghum a <dig> cms  <cit> . however, the relationship between editing to fertility restoration remains unclear. earlier authors  <cit>  have shown that restorer genes increase the editing efficiency of atp <dig> transcripts in rice bo-cms cytoplasm. based on the fact that the editing of the orfb transcripts in rice in the present case did not affect the reading frame, the unedited transcripts should hypothetically be translated and result in the production of a mutant form of the protein, as three of the codons that remained unedited alter the amino acids.

reports indicate that most cms-associated genes expressed at much higher levels in anther tissue than in seedlings  <cit>  during micro-sporogenesis when atp requirements are abnormally high  <cit> . high levels of f0f1-atp synthase activity demonstrate that anther cells require more atp than other tissues. because cellular energy requirements are maximal in tapetal cells during microsporogenesis, reduced mitochondrial function in plants could result in pollen abortion. the present investigation detected an unedited ~ <dig>  kb orfb gene transcript in wa cytoplasm rice. it is plausible that competition between translated products of edited and unedited orfb transcripts may lead to impaired biogenesis and uncoupling or decreased phosphorylation activity of the f1f <dig> atpase complex. in the present study, explanations for the absence of orfb transcript editing include, hydrophobicity alteration of the translated product; the lack of phe <dig> in place of leu in the absence of editing may adversely affect membrane attachment function; or the reduction of α-helix and extended coil in the protein may cause the malfunction of subunit  <dig> of the f1f0-atpase complex.

CONCLUSIONS
the study was initiated to elucidate the molecular genetic element of the mt-genome in a cms rice line with wild abortive  cytoplasm that may be involved in causing male sterility. the study has clearly identified a putative cms-associated mt-gene in the wa cytoplasm of rice. studies are currently on-going to determine the functional role of the polymorphic orfb gene in causing cytoplasmic male sterility in the apms-6a rice line . because hybrid seed production in rice is based primarily on the wa-type of cms, these results may serve to develop future breeding strategies. the cms system can be engineered to use a transgenic approach to more fully realize hybrid vigor in rice.
