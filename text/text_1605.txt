BACKGROUND
g protein-coupled receptors  constitute a large protein superfamily with more than  <dig> candidate genes in the human genome  <cit> . gpcrs mediate various biological responses and thus, are important targets for therapeutic drugs. most gpcrs can produce intracellular signaling as monomers or homomeric oligomers. moreover, many gpcrs form heteromeric complexes with different types of gpcrs and produce intriguing signaling through inter-gpcr modulation  <cit> . real-time observation of gpcr signaling and inter-gpcr modulation in living cells is key to molecular study of biological responses and pharmaceutical development . however, fluorescence imaging, the technique widely used for this purpose, requires a fluorescent dye which may inhibit biological responses  or a fluorescent-tagged target protein created through time-consuming genetic manipulation .

two-dimensional surface plasmon resonance  imaging may provide a ready-to-use tool to explore gpcr signaling and modulation in intact cells. since pioneered by liedberg et al., spr imaging has been utilized for cell-free immunoassay to detect a specific protein in a sample solution  <cit> . typically, a sample solution is examined on a gold-plated slide glass with an antibody on its surface. incident light given to the slide glass evokes the resonant oscillation of conduction electrons at the interface between the sample solution and the gold surface  . when the target protein is trapped by the antibody on the gold surface, the relation of the angle of incidence to spr extent  will alter. with a fixed angle of incidence, such an alteration results in a decrease or increase of the consumption of the incident light energy for evoking spr and an increase or decrease of the light reflection from the specimens, respectively. thus, the light reflection intensity can be taken as a measure of the amount of the trapped protein. recently, hide’s group  <cit>  and shinohara’s group  <cit>  revealed that the accumulation of intracellular proteins near the plasma membrane of the cells cultured on a gold-plated slide glass can also affect the spr curve . the latter group further used spr imaging to detect translocation of native protein kinase c  in response to 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate , a pkc agonist, or an agonist for native pkc-coupled gpcr in pc <dig> cells  <cit> . when activated, conventional-type pkc is known to translocate from the cytosol to the plasma membrane  and the resultant accumulation of pkc near the plasma membrane is thought to increase the reflection  <cit> . pkc translocation can be taken as a measure of pkc activity. besides, pkc translocation itself is an important step of biological responses because the target proteins of pkc-mediated phosphorylation such as ionotropic glutamate receptor reside on the plasma membrane .fig.  <dig> experimental set-up. a hek <dig> cells were cultured on a 50 nm-thick gold-plated slide glass. the cell chamber was surrounded with a silicone rubber wall attached to the slide glass. b configuration of spr imaging. spr takes place, consuming the energy of the evanescent light derived from the p-polarized component of the incident light. pkc accumulated on the plasma membrane alters the mode of spr, and this results in changes in the consumption of the evanescent light energy and the intensity of the reflection of the p-polarized light. theta, angle of incidence. c sample plots of r

if pkc translocation monitoring with spr imaging is applicable to heterologous expression systems, it will be of great benefit to biological researchers and drug developers. in such a system, one can analyze the functions of specific gpcr signaling cascades of interest in a reduced cellular environment free from other signaling cascades. in this study, we explored this possibility in the widely used heterologous expression system based on human embryo kidney-derived hek <dig> cell lines. we used type- <dig> metabotropic glutamate receptor  and adenosine a <dig> receptor  as a model of interplaying gpcrs  <cit> . in mammalian cerebellar purkinje neurons, mglur <dig> receives the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and activates pkc via the gq/ <dig> protein-phospholipase c cascade. this signaling triggers long-term depression of purkinje cell’s postsynaptic glutamate-sensitivity , a cellular basis for cerebellar motor learning  <cit> . it is shown that mglur <dig> forms complexes with a1r  <cit> , which receives adenosine in the cerebrospinal fluid  <cit>  and activates gi/o protein. we have revealed that a1r activation leads to suppression of glu-ltd  <cit> . such inter-gpcr modulation would be important because it may serve as the regulatory mechanism of learning behavior. although circumstantial evidence suggests that ligand-stimulated a1r attenuates mglur <dig> intracellular signaling  <cit> , there was no direct demonstration of the effect of a1r activation on the activity of mglur1-coupled signaling molecule. we assessed the ability of spr imaging to detect pkc translocation initiated by ligand binding to mglur <dig> as well as a1r-mediated modulation of mglur1-mediated pkc translocation.

RESULTS
experimental set-up
hek <dig> cell lines could be maintained on the uncoated gold-plated glass . heterologous expression of the gpcrs could be induced in these cultured cells within the measurement chamber . such simple cell handling saved labor and time.

among the components of the incident light, only one whose polarization occurs parallel to the plane of incidence  is consumed to evoke spr. thus, the intensity of the reflection of the p-polarized light  is sensitive to changes of the spr curve due to intracellular protein translocation. on the other hand, the intensity of the reflection of the component whose polarization occurs perpendicular to the plane of incidence  is not sensitive to the changes of the spr curve. we quantify intracellular protein translocation by the ratio of rp to rs  .

we measured rp/s, varying the angle of incidence before and after an application of tpa, a potent pkc activator  . in the following analyses, the angle of incidence was fixed at the value with which tpa-induced change in rp/s became maximal. in this study, we once polished the imager’s prism to maintain the image quality. the angles of incidence for the maximal rp/s change were  <dig>  ° and  <dig>  ° before and after the polishing, respectively.

detection of pkc translocation
in non-transfected hek293t cells, a 25-min application of the control vehicle {dimethyl sulfoxide } alone little altered rp/s at the application onset and onward for 25 min. the change of rp/s at the end of the 25-min dmso application was only + <dig>  ±  <dig>  %  of the basal level expressed by the average over a 5-min period prior to the dmso application . the raw basal rp/s was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % and the raw rp/s at the end of the 25-min dmso application  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %. in different non-transfected cells of the same batches of cultures, a 25-min application of tpa  increased rp/s by + <dig>  ±  <dig>  %  . the raw basal rp/s was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % and the raw rp/s at the end of the 25-min tpa application  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %. the extent of rp/s change at the end of the 25-min application was significantly different between the control vehicle- and tpa-applied cells . the polarity of the rp/s change  after pkc activation was consistent with the previous report  <cit> .fig.  <dig> pkc activation results in an increase in r

expression of a1r and mglur <dig> in hek293am cells
for analysis of mglur1- and a1r-mediated responses, we used hek293am cells, a previously established stable cell line containing the tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation system and mglur <dig> and a1r genes  <cit> . this cell line was designed to express these gpcrs only when stimulated with a tetracycline derivative such as doxycycline. we used the inducible expression system because cell lines expressing the exogenous gpcrs under the control of constitutive promoters were often lost  <cit> .

we confirmed the expression of a1r and mglur <dig> in hek293am cells using immunocytochemistry. hek293am cells displayed both immunoreactivities for a1r and mglur <dig> on their surface when stimulated with doxycycline ). the absence of immunoreactivities for these gpcrs in doxycycline-untreated cells ) suggests that this cell line lacks native mglur <dig> and a1r. this allowed us to focus on the signaling of heterologously expressed gpcrs. once expressed in hek293am cells, a1r and mglur <dig> are thought to form heteromeric complexes as reported in the previous co-immunoprecipitation and föster resonance energy transfer studies  <cit> .fig.  <dig> expression of mglur <dig> and a1r in hek293am cells. confocal images of doxycycline-treated or -untreated hek293am cells immunostained with anti-a1r and anti-mglur <dig> primary antibodies and fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibodies



detection of mglur1-mediated pkc translocation
in doxycycline-treated hek293am cells, a 25-min application of - <dig> -dihydroxyphenylglycine , a group-i mglur agonist, increased rp/s by + <dig>  ±  <dig>  %  . the raw basal rp/s was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % and the raw rp/s at the end of the 25-min dhpg application  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %. this dhpg-induced rp/s increase was not an artifact because the saline containing the control vehicle  alone did not increase rp/s in doxycycline-treated hek293am cells . in different doxycycline-treated hek293am cells of the same batches of cultures, a 10-min pre-conditioning with the pkc inhibitor bim <dig> abolished the effect of dhpg  . the raw basal rp/s was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % and the raw rp/s at the end of the 25-min dhpg application  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %. the extent of rp/s change at the end of the 25-min dhpg application was significantly different between the bim1-untreated and -treated cells . these results suggest that spr imaging can detect pkc translocation initiated by ligand binding to mglur <dig>  in addition, in the presence of bim <dig>  rp/s decreased below the basal level  at the late phase of the measurement . a possibility is that bim <dig> not only hampered dhpg-induced pkc activation but also attenuated the basal activity of pkc as previously shown in hek <dig> cells .fig.  <dig> spr imaging can detect pkc translocation initiated by ligand binding to mglur <dig>  a and b in doxycycline-treated hek293am cells, the mglur <dig> agonist dhpg  increased r

in doxycycline-treated hek293am cells of different batches of culture, the relative extent of dhpg-induced rp/s increase changed in a dhpg-dose dependent manner , suggesting that spr imaging can be used for quantitative evaluation of gpcr signaling. the microscopic dissociation constant and hill coefficient estimated from the hill equation fitted to the dose-response data were  <dig>  μm and  <dig> , respectively . it is noteworthy that desensitization was evident with the highest dose  of dhpg . this might be due partly to the kinetic property of mglur <dig> because desensitization is observed commonly for mglur1-mediated cation channel current and intracellular ca2+ mobilization induced by high doses of dhpg in cerebellar neurons  <cit> .

it is reported that doxycycline may inhibit multiple intracellular signaling pathways  <cit> . thus, replacement with the doxyclycline-containing culture medium with the doxycycline-free saline before the measurement could possibly relieve the cells from such doxycycline-induced inhibition during the measurement. this alone or together with dhpg stimulation could produce a pseudo response. however, non-transfected hek293t cells treated with doxycycline  prior to the measurement did not display a rp/s increase in response to dhpg  . this result suggests that the dhpg-induced rp/s increases observed in the hek293am cells  were indeed mglur1-mediated responses but not the pseudo responses.fig.  <dig> a1r activation leads to suppression of mglur1-mediated pkc activation. a and b in doxycycline-treated hek293am cells, a 25-min application of dhpg  increased r

detection of modulation of mglur1-mediated pkc translocation by a1r
in doxycycline-treated hek293am cells of different batches of cultures, a 25-min application of dhpg again increased rp/s by + <dig>  ±  <dig>  %  . the raw basal rp/s was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % and the raw rp/s at the end of the 25-min dhpg application  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %. in different doxycycline-treated cells of the same batches of cultures, a 10-min pre-conditioning with -n6-phenylisopropyladenosine , an a1r-selective agonist, abolished dhpg-induced rp/s increase  . the raw basal rp/s was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % and the raw rp/s at the end of the 25-min dhpg application  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %. the extent of rp/s change at the end of the 25-min dhpg application was significantly different between the r-pia-untreated and -treated cells . this result suggests that a1r activation leads to suppression of mglur1-pkc signaling.

pkc is an essential mediator for induction of cerebellar ltd. pkc-mediated phosphorylation is thought to trigger endocytosis of ionotropic glutamate receptor, the final stage of cererellar ltd induction  <cit> . thus, the previously reported negative effect of a1r agonist on glu-ltd  <cit>  can be ascribed at least in part to suppression of mglur1-mediated pkc activation by a1r . moreover, we observed this suppression in the non-neuronal cells, suggesting that a1r-mglur <dig> functional interplay may occur independently of the neuron-specific cellular environment.

we confirmed that a1r indeed mediated the effect of r-pia, using a hek <dig> cell line that expressed mglur <dig> and gq/ <dig> protein-coupled gastrin-releasing peptide receptor  but not a1r . although pre-conditioned with a high dose  of r-pia for 10 min, doxycycline-treated hek293gm cells displayed a rp/s increase in response to dhpg . the extent of this increase  was comparable with that of the hek293am cells . the raw basal rp/s was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % and the raw rp/s at the end of the 25-min dhpg agent application  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %.

reproducibility and stability of measurement
the extent of tpa-induced rp/s increase was similar between the different batches of cultures . as well, the extent of dhpg-induced rp/s increase was similar between the different batches of cultures . these results indicate the high reproducibility of the measurement. the control vehicle did not change rp/s at the application onset and onward for 25 min , indicating that the measurement is robust against physical shock due to test drug application and can stably monitor the response of living cells for a long time. with the easiness-to-use and reliability, spr imaging in heterologous expression cell preparations may provide a useful experimental paradigm for investigation of gpcr signaling.

CONCLUSIONS
in hek <dig> cell lines, spr imaging could detect pkc translocation resulting from direct activation of pkc itself or initiated by ligand binding to heterologously expressed mglur <dig>  spr imaging could also detect the modulation of heterologously expressed mglur1-mediated pkc translocation by heterologously expressed a1r. spr imaging in heterologous expression cells provides a powerful yet easy-to-use tool for analyzing gpcr-coupled intracellular signaling and inter-gpcr modulation in living cells.
