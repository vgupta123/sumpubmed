BACKGROUND
nerve growth factor  is a member of the family of neurotrophins and is essential for the survival and differentiation of neurons in central and peripheral nerve systems  <cit> . the binding of ngf to its high affinity receptor, tropomyosin-receptor-kinasea, causes activation of the receptor associated tyrosine kinase and participates in the control of mitogenic, survival or differentiation pathways. it has been suggested that ngf and its receptor may also be involved in hematopoietic cell development  <cit> . in those studies ngf induced synergistic action for the colony formation of cd <dig> positive hematopoietic progenitor cells treated with the macrophage colony stimulating factor   <cit> , or stem cell factor   <cit> . however, the exact role of trka in hematopoietic cell differentiation remains unclear.

the receptor for scf, c-kit tyrosine kinase plays a key role in hematopoietic stem cell and mast cell survival, mitogenesis, proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, homing, migration, and functional activation. despite diversity in the mechanisms of their activation by growth factor ligands  <cit> , most receptor tyrosine kinases induce signals through the same pathways to typically enhance proliferation and prolong viability. these pathways include activation of the ras/raf/erk, activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription , and phosphatidylinositol  <dig> kinase . indeed, c-kit activation induces all of these pathways, while activated trka induces ras/raf/erk, and pi3k pathways but does not cause tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous stats  <cit> , suggesting that scf and ngf not only induce common signal pathways, but also induce unique signal pathways. however, the differences between a set of genes which are upregulated by ngf and those upregulated by scf in hematopoietic cells has not yet been studied.

the rat pheochromocytoma cell line, pc <dig>  is one of the most thoroughly established systems to study the ngf mediated signal transduction pathway followed by neuronal differentiation. various studies have investigated gene expression profiles in ngf-treated pc <dig> cells  <cit> , however whether these upregulated genes are similar to genes in the hematopoietic system is not clear. interestingly, leukemogenic mutant trka  <cit>  does not induce tumor formation, but induces the differentiation of pc <dig> cells , suggesting that ngf/trka signaling is different in neuronal and hematopoietic cells. we have previously shown that ngf-trka signaling partially rescues trka expressing bcr-abl transformed chronic myelogenous leukemia  cells, such as k <dig>  and meg- <dig>  from cell death induced by a potent inhibitor of bcr-abl tyrosine kinase, imatinib mesylate . however, the effects of ngf on imatinib treated cml cells are modest. in the presence of ngf, the number of living k <dig> cells treated with imatinib increased by only  <dig> -fold within  <dig> days and meg- <dig> cells did not grow, but just survived for a longer period  <cit> . a dramatic effect of ngf treatment was observed in oncogenic c-kit  transformed human mastocytoma cells ) <cit>  which are also induced to undergo apoptosis by treatment with imatinib. hmc- <dig>  cells continue to grow nearly normally in the presence of both imatinib and ngf  <cit> .

in this paper, using hmc- <dig>  cells we compared ngf and scf signaling in the same cell system. hmc- <dig>  <cit>  expresses the activated scf receptor, v560g and/or d816v c-kit  <cit>  and trka  <cit> . the kinase activity of v560g c-kit can be inhibited completely by treatment with imatinib  <cit>  and cells died within  <dig> days. ngf rescues hmc- <dig>  cells from imatinib mediated cell death and promotes proliferation  <cit> , indicating that ngf can take over mitogenic signaling in these cells. therefore, we compared the ngf mediated upregulated genes  to the downregulated genes by imatinib treatment  by transcriptome analysis. we found kruppel-like factor   <dig> and smad family member  <dig>  as the ngf mediated novel down stream genes in hematopoietic cells and klf <dig> may be involved in ngf mediated survival of imatinib treated cells.

RESULTS
ngf rescues hmc- <dig>  cells from imatinib mediated cell death and promotes proliferation
to assess the biological effects of ngf on hmc- <dig> cells in the absence of c-kit-mediated signal, we treated the cells with  <dig> μm imatinib in the presence or absence of  <dig> ng/ml ngf. viable cells were counted  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days after treatment using trypan blue cell exclusion assay. in agreement with previous data  <cit> , more than 95% cell death was observed within  <dig> h of treatment with imatinib alone. in sharp contrast, hmc- <dig> cells treated with imatinib in the presence of ngf continued to proliferate even after  <dig> h at a rate almost similar to untreated controls . in fact, ngf could support long-term survival  of these cells in the presence of imatinib . in agreement with these data ngf treatment has been shown to induce mitogenic signals in cd <dig> positive hematopoietic progenitor cells  <cit> . interestingly, it has been reported that the ngf stimulation induces the activation of erk1/ <dig> and pi3k, but does not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of stats in pc <dig> cells  <cit> , in promyeloid cell line 32d  <cit>  or in hmc- <dig> cells . on the other hand, stat <dig> activation is required for the maintenance of mast cells  <cit> , suggesting that ngf may induce unknown signals for the maintenance of hmc- <dig> cells without stats signaling. we next analyzed the gene profile induced by ngf treatment of hmc- <dig> cells. to understand how ngf-trka activation counteracts the effect of c-kit inhibition and promotes survival in hmc- <dig> cells we performed gene expression profiling using a high density microarray technique employing the "whole human genome microarray"  that contains  <dig>  probes. first, we determined the genes which were regulated as a result of c-kit inhibition by comparing untreated hmc- <dig> cells in serum free medium with cells after addition of  <dig> μm imatinib for  <dig> h. second, we studied changes in gene expression caused by the addition of ngf  for  <dig> min  and  <dig> h  to the imatinib treated cells. based on the filtering criteria mentioned in the methods section,  <dig> genes of known identities were downregulated and  <dig> genes were upregulated by treatment with imatinib, with expression ratios ranging from  <dig> to 45-fold and  <dig> to 10-fold, respectively. twenty one genes of known identities were found induced after  <dig> min and  <dig> genes after  <dig> h of ngf stimulation following  <dig> h of imatinib treatment, with fold induction values ranging from  <dig> to 94- and  <dig> to 30-fold, respectively. furthermore, ngf treatment repressed one gene after  <dig> min and seven genes after  <dig> h in imatinib treated cells.

ngf induced immediate and delayed early genes in imatinib treated hmc- <dig> cells including several known ngf responsive immediate early genes such as the early growth response  family egr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  c-fos, and junb being upregulated after  <dig> min of ngf treatment, followed by induction of delayed early genes such as ngfi-a binding protein  <dig> , hairy and enhancer of split,  , kruppel-like factor  <dig>  and activating transcription factors  <dig>  after  <dig> h.

prominently, egr <dig> , first discovered as a ngf responsive gene in pc <dig> cells, was induced more than 90-fold within  <dig> min of trka activation providing an initial validation for our array  <cit> . to gain insight into the potential mechanism by which ngf can overcome imatinib induced apoptosis we focused our further investigation on the comparison of genes that were downregulated by imatinib and up-regulated by ngf treatment for  <dig> h. to derive a biological meaning from the individual lists of v560g c-kit and ngf-trka-modulated genes, we uploaded these lists to ingenuity pathways analysis  application for biological function and pathway analysis. out of a total of  <dig> genes modulated by imatinib treatment  <dig> genes mapped to the ipa knowledge database with  <dig> genes for functions/pathways analysis. out of  <dig> ngf induced genes accepted by the ipa knowledge database ,  <dig> mapped for functions/pathways analysis. a comparison of the two gene lists revealed a common set of  <dig> genes out of  <dig> ngf upregulated genes  that were also downmodulated by imatinib . this suggests that ngf-trka signaling regulates many genes the expression of which are also regulated by v560g c-kit in hmc- <dig> cells.

ngf-trka activation does not enhance expression of genes involved in immune related functions that were downregulated by imatinib treatment
since the expression of  <dig> genes out of  <dig> genes which were downregulated by imatinib treatment for  <dig> h was not restored by the stimulation with ngf for  <dig> h , we next analyzed the two datasets using panther  protein class analysis which measures the significance of certain functional categories among these targets by their enrichment relative to the total numbers in their respective categories. as shown in table  <dig>  immune response component genes such as cytokines and cytokine receptors genes were significantly downregulated  by imatinib treatment. in contrast, ngf-trka does not activate receptor genes significantly . in addition, ngf-trka activated cytokine genes  but drastically fewer genes than c-kit mediated gene modulation . these data suggest that ngf can take over the proliferation signal but not immune related function induced by c-kit.

ns: not significant

more than 67% of ngf-trka upregulated genes are involved in cell survival and proliferation
we next analyzed genes which are upregulated by ngf-trka signaling by ipa analysis. significantly, over 67% of upregulated genes are involved in survival and proliferation . although the immediate-early response genes, such as egr <dig>  c-fos, or fosb are also downstream of c-kit signaling, these genes are not constitutively expressing. therefore, several c-kit inducible genes were not downregulated by imatinib treatment. to confirm the micro array data, we performed quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  to examine the relative expression level of c-fos, junb, egr <dig>  and c-myc. hmc- <dig> cells were incubated without serum for  <dig> h and were then treated with imatinib  for  <dig> h. cells were stimulated with ngf for  <dig> and  <dig> min. all samples were standardized by expression level of glucuronidase beta  mrna. in agreement with the micro array data, qrt-pcr analysis revealed that immediate-early response genes, such as c-fos  junb , and egr <dig> , were upregulated upon stimulation with ngf compared to expression level in untreated hmc- <dig> cells. standardization of rna level using a gusb probe was confirmed by a gapdh probe. the relative expression level of each sample was comparable . c-myc expression was also upregulated upon stimulation with ngf in imatinib treated cells in the absence of serum, however, its expression level was lower than that in imatinib-untreated cells with serum . to examine whether high c-myc expression in untreated cells is due to the activated c-kit kinase and/or serum which may contain activation factor of the c-myc gene, we performed c-myc specific qrt-pcr in the presence of serum with imatinib and/or ngf . imatinib suppressed c-myc expression about 70% even in the presence of serum, suggesting that activated c-kit  induces c-myc expression. however, in the presence of serum, ngf induces c-myc expression 2-fold more than in the absence of serum, suggesting that serum and c-kit or trka tyrosine kinase synergistically induce c-myc expression .

category
furthermore,  <dig> genes, including c-myc, egr <dig>  egr <dig>  hes <dig>  and klf <dig> of  <dig> genes that were downmodulated by imatinib and upregulated upon stimulation with ngf are involved in survival and proliferation, suggesting that ngf/trka signaling may take over the survival and/or mitogenic signal in the imatinib treated hmc- <dig> cells using these genes.

novel target genes, klf <dig>  and smad <dig> which were induced by ngf-trka signaling are involved in anti apoptosis signal in hematopoietic cell system
expression profiling of ngf-trka induced genes is well documented in neuronal cell systems  <cit> . however, there is no information about profiles of genes induced by ngf-trka signaling in a hematopoietic cell system. we therefore compared our upregulated genes to known ngf targets in neuronal cells. several genes, such as the recently demonstrated atf <dig>  klf <dig>  and v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene family protein f   <cit>  were found to be induced in our array. in addition to the above, we show for the first time the upregulation of potential novel trka target genes such as klf <dig>  smad <dig>  and homeobox members, hoxb <dig> and pbx <dig>  upon ngf stimulation in hmc- <dig> cells. since it has been shown that an immediate early gene product, klf <dig> activates smad <dig> expression  <cit> , we examined the upregulation of klf <dig>  smad <dig> and egr <dig> by rt-pcr . in agreement with array data, klf <dig> was upregulated within  <dig> min similar to the egr <dig> gene, however, smad <dig> was upregulated in  <dig> h , suggesting that klf <dig> may be the direct target gene of ngf/trka signaling, but not smad <dig>  we next asked whether klf <dig> and smad <dig> are targets of c-kit signaling. since oncogenic c-kit  is not fully activated, scf treatment is able to induce further upregulation of c-kit mediated signaling  <cit> . hmc- <dig> cells were grown in the absence of serum for  <dig> h, and were then stimulated with scf . the expression of klf <dig>  smad <dig> and egr <dig> was then examined by rt-pcr. all three genes were upregulated by stimulation with scf . it should be noted that klf <dig> and smad <dig> are also novel target genes for c-kit signaling. to further confirm these data, we performed klf <dig> specific qrt-pcr showing that serum starvation down-regulates klf <dig> expression about 5-fold. however, upon stimulation with scf or ngf in the absence of serum, within  <dig> min the klf <dig> gene was upregulated 24-fold and 14-fold, respectively . klf <dig> is known to regulate self renewal and block the differentiation in embryo stem cells  <cit> , suggesting that ngf/trka associates with a novel function other than neuronal differentiation. to examine whether klf <dig> participates in the survival and proliferation signal induced by ngf, the klf <dig> gene was downregulated by klf <dig> specific sirna in hmc- <dig> cells. two days after treatment of hmc- <dig>  with klf <dig> specific sirna, the expression level of klf <dig> declined to 26% . the transient knockdown of klf <dig> in hmc- <dig> cells did not change the growth rate within  <dig> days after transfection under normal condition or in the presence of imatinib and ngf. we next examined whether klf <dig> plays a role as a survival signal in imatinib treated hmc- <dig>  cells. we began by examining caspase  <dig> cleavage. cleaved caspase  <dig> was observed only  <dig> h after imatinib treatment in control sirna treated cells, whereas in klf <dig> specific sirna treated cells caspase  <dig> was cleaved within  <dig> h .

furthermore, to assess the degree of apoptosis, sister culture cells were stained by an in situ cell death detection kit  for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp nick end labeling . in agreement with data obtained from caspase  <dig> cleavage, tunel positive cells appeared within  <dig> h after imatinib treatment in both klf <dig> specific sirna and control sirna treated cells. however, numbers of tunel positive cells increased significantly faster in klf <dig> sirna treated cells than in control sirna transfected cells  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> h  after imatinib treatment .

since klf <dig> specific sirna transfectants still grow in the presence of ngf and imatinib, additional survival signals may be mediated by ngf treatment. however, our data strongly suggest that klf <dig> is involved in an anti-apoptosis signal.

discussion
cell differentiation and self-renewal are paralleled by a timely, ordered expression of a set of cytokines, growth factors and corresponding receptors. many members of receptor tyrosine kinase family have emerged as key regulators of these critical cellular processes  <cit> . humans have  <dig> known receptor tyrosine kinases, which fall into  <dig> subfamilies. despite differences in structure, many of tyrosine kinases signal through the same pathways to typically enhance proliferation and prolong viability. these pathways include activation of the ras/raf/erk, stats and pi3k. these facts raised the question of whether each receptor tyrosine kinase is associated with a similar signaling potential, regulated by different expression patterns in different cell types, or whether each tyrosine kinase exhibits a unique signaling pathway.

it has previously been shown that trka and c-kit are co-expressed in mast cells and hematopoietic cd <dig> positive cells. the treatment of cd <dig> positive cells with ngf showed the synergistic effects with the scf treatment on colony formation. for mast cell culture in vitro, bone marrow cells are cultivated for 4- <dig> weeks in the presence of scf, interleukin   <dig> and il <dig>  <cit> . we examined whether mouse primary mast cells can survive in the presence of ngf, or ngf and il3/il <dig> in the absence of scf. under these conditions mouse mast cells did not survive in the absence of scf. these data suggest that ngf does not assume the role of scf in normal mast cells. according to panther analysis  <cit> , the difference of gene upregulation of cytokines, growth factors, and their receptors between scf and ngf stimulation is significant, suggesting that upregulation of cytokines and their receptors play a role in survival of normal mast cells. in agreement with these data, few genes encoding cytokines/their receptors in pc <dig> cells were upregulated  <dig> h after ngf treatment  <cit> , suggesting that ngf poorly induces cytokine and growth factor genes in different cell types.

it has been shown that stat <dig> is required for c-kit mediated mast cell survival and differentiation  <cit> . although ngf does not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of stats, hmc- <dig> cells survive by ngf stimulation without c-kit signaling. thereby our array data provide novel candidate genes, klf <dig>  smad <dig>  pbx <dig>  and hoxb <dig> which are induced by ngf/trka activation in hematopoietic cells, and have not been reported as ngf target genes in the pc <dig> cell system  <cit> . on the other hand, another known target gene of ngf treatment in pc <dig> cells, wingless-related mmtv integration site 7b   <cit>  was not upregulated by ngf treatment in hmc- <dig>  cells, suggesting that wnt7b may be a specific target gene for ngf signaling in neuronal cells. these data indicate that most ngf upregulated genes were common, but some of them may be cell-type specific. however, we cannot presently rule out the possibility that the difference of upregulated genes is due to differences between human  and rat  cells.

interestingly, klf <dig>  smad <dig>  pbx <dig>  and hoxb <dig> are suggested to be involved in self-renewal or in anti differentiation signal of stem cells or hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> . we show here that klf <dig> modulates imatinib-mediate apoptosis. along the same line, it has been shown that klf2-deficient t cells had a spontaneously activated phenotype and died rapidly from fas-ligand-induced apoptosis  <cit> , and induction of klf <dig> expression corresponded with long-term t cell survival  <cit> , suggesting that klf <dig> plays a role in t cell survival. furthermore, klf2-/- embryos have a significantly increased number of primitive erythroid cells undergoing apoptotic cell death. these data suggest that the upregulation of the klf <dig> gene induced by the stimulation with ngf plays a role in the survival signal in imatinib treated hmc- <dig> cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we compared the signaling of two structurally and functionally diverse receptor tyrosine kinases, c-kit and trka, in hematopoietic cells. the c-kit activation induces cytokines and their receptors, but trka does not, suggesting that the part of the signal pathways induced by the two receptors is different. however, trka is able to induce common novel downstream targets such as klf <dig> and smad <dig> which has not been reported in the neuronal system, indicating that ngf induces genes which are involved in stem cell maintenance similar to c-kit signaling in hematopoietic cells. furthermore, upregulation of klf <dig> may be involved in ngf mediated survival of imatinib treated cells.
