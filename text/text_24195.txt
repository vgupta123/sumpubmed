BACKGROUND
the percentage of patients with severe infections caused by gram-positive bacteria has increased in recent years, accounting for almost half of the incidents of septicemia and severe systemic infections  <cit> . a number of recent publications have investigated the transcriptional response to killed or inactive gram-positive pathogens, or the contribution of gram-positive cell wall constituents such as peptidoglycan , lipopeptide  and lipoteichoic acid  to the triggering of specific host defense responses  <cit> . though such studies are crucial for identifying stimulus specific effects, they are unable to account for the immunomodulatory effects of live bacteria, which frequently employ multiple survival strategies in parallel. viable pathogenic bacteria secrete active components in the intercellular space and in the invaded cells in order to modulate the cellular response. in order to track the early events of gram-positive induced immune activation, we examined the total transcriptional response of isolated peripheral human cd14+/cd11b+ monocytes, infected with the viable bacterial pathogens: listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae . all three pathogens belong to the group of low gc content bacteria. sp and sa are leading pathogens in cases of gram-positive sepsis and lm is a cause of meningitis in immunocompromised patients and also sepsis in newborns.

we designed and established a protocol enabling the detection of pathological changes early in the onset of infections with gram positive pathogens, before usual clinical parameters are upregulated, in an easily accessible cellular sample material. for these purposes, we focused our experimental analysis of naïve monocytes, which are easier to work with in ex vivo conditions than granulocytes, even though they are represented in much lower numbers in vivo than the latter. peripheral monocytes also are among the first members of the host immune system to encounter pathogens after injury and epithelial penetration. we limited the infection to a short interval of  <dig> hour in the attempt to mimic the in vivo early reaction of the cells after first encountering the pathogen but before the onset of clinically manifested inflammation. using microarray analysis, we were able to detect the transcriptional upregulation or repression of a robust minimal set of genes in infected cells compared to untreated controls in the short interval of one hour. despite donor specific gene variations and despite the different invasion strategies of the bacteria studied, we identified a common program of gene expression induced by all three bacterial pathogens. this program is characterized by the upregulation of a key cytokine - interleukin  <dig> .

RESULTS
global response pattern of peripheral monocytes to infection
to assess the global response we performed clustering of the correlation coefficients of the entire gene expression matrix comprising the unchallenged and the infected monocytes with all three pathogens . this revealed an interesting pattern. as can be seen from the figure, there are three main clusters. cluster a comprising the controls, cluster b comprising infection with l. monocytogenes  and s. aureus , and cluster c comprising infection with s. pneumoniae . we compared each pathogen to the control group to identify the differentially expressed genes . lm caused the induction of transcription of  <dig> and repression of  <dig> genes . the transcription of  <dig> genes was upregulated and  <dig> genes were downregulated upon infection with sa . for sp these numbers were smaller, with  <dig> and  <dig> genes upregulated respectively downregulated  <dig> h upon infection . induction of target gene expression for the common upregulated genes was consistently higher for lm and sa than sp. all differentially expressed genes by pathogen with fold changes are available as additional files .

common and pathogen specific responses of peripheral monocytes
all pathogens induced a common set of  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes . consistent with common core responses against pathogenic stimuli  <cit> , we observed genes involved in proinflammation, chemotaxis, suppression of immune response and adhesion molecules. lm induced the largest number of pathogen-specific transcription changes, especially downregulating  <dig> genes , compared with  <dig> by sa . only two genes  were individually downregulated by sp and  <dig> genes were upregulated only by infection with sp . all of the common regulated genes sorted by gene ontology  are available as additional file .

surprisingly, the major inflammatory cytokines il <dig> and tnf were absent from the list of commonly expressed genes, and highest expression levels in this gene set were detected for the interleukin 23a  mrna followed by cd <dig> . in our experiment the il23a levels were  <dig> -, 30- and 6-fold elevated after infection with lm, sa and sp, respectively. we observed induction of chemokines and cytokines of the ccl and cxcl families with ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> commonly induced by all thee pathogens. genes responsible for the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and adhesion e.g. talin <dig> , claudin  <dig>  and tubulin complex member protein  <dig>  were also upregulated .

variation in the control group
the availability of non-infected controls provided us with an opportunity to assess which genes are most differently expressed among the control group before any challenge with the bacteria as well. the top most variable  <dig> genes were analyzed using the over-presentation analysis feature in the david database  using the entire list of accessions from the microarray chip as a background. we found that the gene categories that were highly over-represented in this set of genes  were related to the immune response. this suggests that even without bacterial challenge, gene expression of the immune response genes is highly variable and this may also reflect the different physiological state of the donors. at the other end of the spectrum, the genes with the lowest variation in gene expression were found to comprise genes responsible for cellular adhesion , cytoskeleton organization  and oxidative phosphorylation  suggesting that maintenance of cell-cell interactions, cellular shape and energy generation are important functions that are discharged in a uniform manner across donors. the list of these most variable and the least variable genes across all donors is available as additional file .

validation of microarray data by quantitative rt-pcr 
in order to verify our microarray data we performed qrt-pcr with  <dig> target genes. il23a , jun , nalp <dig> , fadd -associated via death domain), socs <dig> , socs <dig> , tlr <dig> , saa , il21r , defb <dig> , il15ra , psmb <dig> , il <dig>  and inhba . the relative fold change of target genes was normalized by the relative expression of a pool of  <dig> reference genes: b2m , g6pd , pgk <dig>  and sdha . normalized fold change for a target gene versus every reference gene was calculated and a mean fold change of these four was the final value. this normalized mean fold change was plotted against the microarray expression fold change for the same target gene and the linear regression showed a correlations coefficient r <dig> =  <dig>  .

ifnγ, il12a and il23b expression
since the codelink human uniset i array does not contain a probe for interferon gamma , we additionally performed real time rt-pcr tests with ifnγ specific primers and found the mrna to be  <dig>  fold upregulated by lm,  <dig>  fold induced by sa and  <dig>  fold induced by sp . we also evaluated the relative expression of il12a  and il23b  mrnas. il <dig> and il <dig> are heterodimeric cytokines, which share the same beta subunit, a protein of  <dig> kda . the combination of p <dig> with a different alpha subunit forms the physiologically active il <dig>  or il <dig> . the il23b was not found upregulated after statistical evaluation and filtering of the primary microarray data, however il23a  mrna was among the most strongly upregulated genes by all three pathogens and hence enhanced expression of the p <dig> unit was expected. the qrt-pcr data showed clearly that il23b  mrna expression was increased in the monocytes of all donors. however this upregulation was highly donor-specific and varied between  <dig> fold and  <dig> fold for lm infection and reached up to more than  <dig> fold change for sa . the expression of il12a  as demonstrated by the qrt-pcr data was regulated at a much lower level with fold change values between + <dig> and - <dig> and was also donor specific.

discussion
using whole-genome based microarray analysis we were able to detect the transcriptional upregulation or repression of a robust minimal set of genes in infected cells compared to untreated controls even within the short interval of one hour. despite donor-specific gene variations and despite varying invasion strategies of the studied bacteria we identified a common program of gene expression induced by all three bacterial pathogens.

remarkably, global comparison of the expression profiles already hinted at gross similarities by the infection among the pathogens . for example, the clustering suggested that the global response of lm and sa are more similar to each other while sp infection generates a different and more subdued response pointing to similarities in the virulence of both lm and sa. one assumption may be that they generate similar responses because of their intracellular nature. however after one hour of infection we observed only a few internalized bacteria  suggesting that secreted bacterial factors, a common feature between l. monocytogenes and s. aureus are important inducers of the response observed. lm expresses a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin  listeriolysin, that is crucial for gaining entry to the cytosol while sa encodes for several haemolysins and cytolysins e.g. the two secretory haemolysins α and β  <cit> . sp, on the other hand, are generally encapsulated bacteria with the capsule effectively preventing ingestion of the bacteria by the monocyte. this creates a physical barrier between the bacteria and the host cell and could underlie the observations on host gene expression made here. the similarity between pneumococcal and lm-induced gene expression could be due to the cellular response to cdc-type toxins produced by these bacteria  <cit> . nevertheless, there were clear differences in the number of detectable differentially regulated genes as well, with fewer genes being differentially expressed on infection with sp. this might point to an as yet unknown mechanism for subduing the host response by sp or it might indicate the improved immune evasion ability of this particular capsular sp strain. remarkably, hallmark inflammatory cytokines, e.g. tnf and il <dig> were not part of the common response of the monocytes. however, the most prominent feature of the common genes set is the upregulation of interleukin 23a  mrna. thus it seems that in naive human monocytes gram-positive bacteria induce the transcription of il <dig> as the first major systemic proinflammatory cytokine, reminiscent of the effects of mycobacteria and salmonellae  <cit> . real time rt-pcr experiments confirmed clearly the induction of il23a  mrna as revealed by the microarray experiments. moreover, the qrt-pcr also showed the upregulation of the il23b  gene, which however was very donor specific with a variation of  <dig> orders of magnitude . thus infection of the monocytes with all gram-positive bacteria led to markedly increased transcription of both genes necessary to form the active il <dig> cytokine. at the same time microarray as well the qrt-pcr data showed only limited upregulation or even downregulation of the il12a  mrna transcription for the individual donors, which confirms the dominant role of il <dig> versus il <dig>  both il <dig> and il <dig> can activate the transcription activator stat <dig> in th-cells and nk cells, and stimulate the production of interferon γ   <cit> . however, as the monocyte population used in this study is almost free of other leukocytes including th-cells and nk cells, the ifnγ back loop that triggers secondary cytokine expression in the monocytes is absent, hence providing an explanation as to why other major inflammatory cytokines like il <dig> and tnf were not substantially upregulated. yet real time rt-pcr tests with ifnγ specific primers revealed upregulation of ifnγ mrna by all three pathogens  suggesting an ability for self-priming of the monocytes even in the absence of additional effector cells.

the proinflammatory reaction with the hallmark upregulation of il <dig> involved also the chemokines ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and osteopontin . ccl <dig> weakly activates monocytes but induces the proliferation of cd34+ progenitor cells. ccl <dig> is chemotactic and is active on all leucocytes  <cit> . osteopontin  induces the migration of macrophages and dendritic cells to the site of inflammation  <cit> . this elevated transcription of chemokine genes is aided by the upregulation of downstream members of the inflammation signaling e.g. pde4b, which is the predominant phosphodiesterase in macrophages and counteracts the inflammation inhibition by cyclic nucleotide signaling  <cit> . in circulating human monocytes pde4b assists the tnfa synthesis and release in response to lps  <cit>  thus our results show that upregulation of pde4b can also be stimulated by alternative pamp sensors since the gram positive bacteria we have used do not produce lps.

recently it was discovered that bacterial lps and non methylated cpg oligonucleotides, which signal via tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> respectively, strongly induce the expression of socs <dig> and socs <dig>  and attenuate the ability of macrophages to respond to subsequent stimulation by ifnγ or il- <dig>  <cit> . similarly it has been described that nalp <dig>  protein expression was also upregulated by lps and interferons  and transient overexpression of nalp <dig> led to inhibition of nfkb signaling  <cit> . we also found that the upregulation of proinflammatory genes was accompanied by the upregulation of known anti-inflammatory proteins of the socs and nalp family . this supports the concept of a dynamic equilibrium between inflammation induction and suppression in order to avoid excessive tissue damage. clearly, gram-positive bacteria are also able to directly induce socs and nalp <dig> gene transcription but the actual pathway of signal transduction here must be attributed either only to tlr <dig> or another pathogen-recognition receptor, most likely tlr <dig>  <cit> .

the microarray results also point to a novel and obviously important function of stimulated monocytes in angiogenesis and modulation of the peripheral vascular tonus. we observed the upregulation of transcription of the strong vasoactive mediators end <dig>  vegf and f <dig>  endothelin  <dig>  is a potent vasoconstrictor and angiogenic peptide. its expression has been attributed to damaged vascular endothelium, mast cells or macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions and thus it appears to be also a feature of stimulated monocytes in response to infection. the potential effect of endothelin induction also correlates with the upregulation of vegf by all three pathogens. vegf  is a major inducer of vascularization and angiogenesis  <cit> . in keeping with this observation we find that f <dig>  is also overexpressed. blood coagulation together with vasoconstriction ensures wound closing and prevents blood loss, but also prevents the invasion and spread of pathogens at the site of injury. osteopontin  protects the endothelial cells against apoptosis and induces cell survival and proliferation. it also promotes migration of macrophages and dendritic cells to the site of inflammation and induces il- <dig> secretion while down regulating the inducible nitric oxide synthase  expression and the no production by macrophages  <cit> . our findings suggest that peripheral monocytes may have a very distinct role in processes of wound healing and the maintenance of environmental barriers when stimulated by bacterial pathogens. interestingly some of the genes found upregulated in the monocytes were reported to have been regulated in endothelial cells upon treatment with vegf: egr <dig>  dusp <dig>  <cit>  thus suggesting autocrine effects of vegf . also the upregulation of vegf in this study was two-fold for every single pathogen unlike the rest of upregulated cytokines and chemokines, which were usually more strongly upregulated by lm and sa. this may be interpreted as a sign for a very tight regulation of this growth factor, since another strong effect of vegf is endothelium permeabilization, which may cause undesired exudate formation.

another interesting characteristic of the common response was the upregulation of genes, known to counteract apoptotic signals and the absence of significant changes in the transcription of proapoptotic mediators. birc <dig>  inhibits apoptosis by binding to tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors traf <dig> and traf <dig>  <cit> . the protein encoded by tnfaip <dig> is a zinc finger protein, and has been shown to inhibit tnf-mediated apoptosis  <cit> . thioredoxin reductase  <dig>  and superoxide dismutase  <dig>  reduce effects of oxidative stress on mitochondria  <cit> . the upregulation of these genes indicates that the cells have to cope with higher radical production in the mitochondria caused by higher energy demands of the cell. on the other hand free radicals are produced by cytoplasmic stress and by lysosomal activity during infection. accumulation of free radicals in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondria leads to activation of apoptotic pathways. hence the upregulation of antiapoptotic genes and radical reducing enzymes as revealed above restores cell homeostasis and cell viability and suggests that at least at this early time point of infection the monocytes are actively suppressing an apoptotic program and are rather becoming primed for pathogen elimination and immune system activation.

the regulation of several genes was specifically influenced only by one of the pathogens. for example lm induced the transcription of fcar , a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. fcar encodes a receptor for the fc region of iga present on the surface of myeloid lineage cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils  <cit> . the activated receptor triggers several immunologic defense processes, including phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and release of inflammatory mediators. this finding suggests the ability of the monocytes to actively interact with iga-opsonized pathogens, which is likely to happen at entry sites of bacteria at mucosal barriers, even when the monocytes have not become tissue resident yet.

sa specifically upregulated mc1r . the expression of mc1r on monocytes was found to be upregulated by lps and proinflammatory cytokines  <cit> . activation of mc1r has been shown to cause a marked reduction of activation and translocation of the nuclear transcription factor nfkb, thus suggesting that αmsh  exerts its anti-inflammatory effect in part through activation of mc1r  <cit> .

surprisingly the overall transcriptional response to infection with sp was weaker compared to lm and sa, even though this strain is a clinical isolate from an infant with severe pneumococcal pneumonia. it appearss that sp relies on its ability to avoid or delay the full innate immune response, hence the smaller number and weaker upregulation of genes involved in the initiation of inflammation . also the two-fold induction of the immunosuppressive cytokine il <dig> may contribute to the initial survival of the pathogen. on the other hand sp specifically induced two genes that are thought to have proinflammatory functions: ccl <dig> and csf <dig>  the protein encoded by the ccl <dig> gene is chemotactic in vitro for thymocytes and activated t cells, but not for b cells, macrophages, or neutrophils. the cytokine encoded by this gene may also play a role in mediating homing of lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs. csf <dig>  is a cytokine that controls the production, differentiation, and function of granulocytes. we may speculate that the specific expression of the last two genes might contribute to severity of the inflammation at later stages of infection as caused by this pathogen in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
we employed dna expression microarrays to study the early transcriptional response of naïve human peripheral monocytes infected with a set of three important gram-positive bacterial pathogens: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and listeria monocytogenes. upregulation of chemokine rather than interleukin genes was characteristic for the early response with the exception of the prominent expression of il <dig>  marking it as the lead early cytokine. an important finding was the observed activation of genes regulating angiogenesis and endothelial cell function together with genes involved in managing pathogen induced cytoplasmic stress and counteracting apoptosis. this transcription program seems to be characteristic for the first events in monocyte activation and points to induction of cytokine signalling rather than to a program change of naïve monocytes to pathogen eliminating effector cells.
