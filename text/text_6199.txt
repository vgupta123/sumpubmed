BACKGROUND
hyperoxia exposure to the developing lung is a critical factor in the occurrence of the most common chronic lung disease in neonates, namely bronchopulmonary dysplasia   <cit> . this is especially important given the recent trend in non-invasive ventilation of preterm neonates; hence, bringing the role of hyperoxia  to the forefront among the environmental factors contributing to "new" bpd  <cit> . while efforts have been made to decrease hyperoxia exposure to the developing lung, the incidence of bpd has actually increased  <cit> . an improved understanding of the mechanisms of hyperoxia-induced cell death and lung injury would be extremely helpful in formulating potential therapeutic strategies with the goal of ameliorating bpd  <cit> .

an important step in this direction would be to understand if varying levels of exposure to hyperoxia  <cit>  have differential impact on lung cell death mechanisms, and if so, evaluate potential therapeutic targets. the mitogen-activated protein kinase  signal transduction pathways are comprised of at least  <dig> distinct families; namely, the extra-cellular signal-regulated kinase , p <dig>  and c-junnh2-terminal kinase  pathways  <cit> . although the functions of the jnk pathways are not yet fully understood, they are known to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, death and inflammatory responses  <cit> . jnk signaling has been implicated in hyperoxia-induced pulmonary injury responses  <cit> .

one of the molecular mediators implicated in hyperoxia-induced cell death and impaired alveolarization in the developing lung is transforming growth factor-beta  <dig>   <cit> , which has also been associated with human bpd  <cit> . another molecule that has been implicated as a downstream mediator of tgf-β <dig> signaling in the newborn lung is connective tissue growth factor   <cit> . recently, the jnk pathway has been implicated for tgf-β1-mediated effects in the developing lung  <cit> .

hence, we hypothesized that inhibition of the jnk signaling pathway in in vitro and in vivo models of hyperoxia-exposure to the lung would improve survival. furthermore, inhibition of the jnk signaling pathway would mitigate tgf-β1- and hyperoxia-mediated effects in the developing lung. our goal was to study cellular responses on exposure to hyperoxia in the presence of jnk inhibition , using cultured human lung epithelial cells and fetal rat lung fibroblasts. in addition, we evaluated the responses of lung-specific tgf-β <dig> overexpression in vivo in the developing lung in the presence of jnki, with or without hyperoxia. specifically, we evaluated mortality, cell proliferation, myofibroblast transdifferentiation and markers thereof , adipocyte differentiation-related protein , fibronectin and lef-1), cell death mediators , and ctgf expression in our in vitro and in vivo models. furthermore, we utilized a newborn  wild type  murine bpd model to assess the impact of jnki on alveolarization.

RESULTS
hyperoxia-induced a <dig> cell death and its mediators are dependent on the jnk pathway
we initially exposed a <dig> and mle cells to varying levels of hyperoxia  for  <dig> h and noted increased cell death, compared to 21% o <dig>  at  <dig> h. importantly, this effect appeared to be dose-dependent . we also noted increased levels of total and phosphorylated jnk  protein with increasing levels of hyperoxia . using the jnk pathway inhibitor sp <dig> in a dose of  <dig> μm decreased phospho-jnk , and was accompanied by a significant increase in cell viability . we had similar results even when we extended the hyperoxia-exposure period to  <dig> h .

to further characterize the mechanism of hyperoxia-induced cell death in the a <dig> cells, we evaluated fas, fas-l, procaspase- <dig>  and cleaved caspase- <dig>  we noted increased fas-l and cleaved caspase- <dig> protein, with increasing concentrations of hyperoxia . addition of jnki mitigated this process . hence, our data suggests that the hyperoxia-induced molecular signals acting via the jnk pathway could be potential targets for prevention of hyperoxia-induced lung cell death.

hyperoxia-induced alveolar interstitial fibroblasts  cell proliferation is not dependent on the jnk pathway
we next examined the effect of hyperoxia on aif proliferation and whether this was modulated via jnk activation. similar to the effect of hyperoxia on epithelial cells, we noted a significant decrease in aif proliferation on exposure to hyperoxia, the effect being much more profound at  <dig> h vs.  <dig> h . there was significant jnk activation on exposure to hyperoxia, evident at  <dig> minutes following exposure to hyperoxia and persisting even at  <dig> h . the hyperoxia-induced jnk activation was also corroborated by immunocytochemistry . in contrast to our observations on epithelial cells, jnki using sp <dig> in a dose of  <dig> μm did not block hyperoxia-induced decrease in aif proliferation .

hyperoxia-induced aif-to-myofibroblast  transdifferentiation is dependent on the jnk pathway
since hyperoxia induces aif-to-myf transdifferentiation  <cit> , we next determined if this process is jnk-dependent. exposure to aif to 95% o <dig> for  <dig> h resulted in a marked decrease  in lipid droplet staining  with a concomitant marked increase in α-sma staining  , indicating hyperoxia-induced aif-to-myf transdifferentiation. both of these changes were remarkably blocked by concomitant jnki  , implying jnk's critical role in aif-to-myf transdifferentiation. jnki was confirmed by western analysis . similar results were obtained on using the jnk inhibitor, sp <dig>  . hyperoxia-induced decrease in pparγ and adrp levels , and the accompanying increase in fibronectin and lef- <dig> levels , key indicators of aif-to-myf transdifferentiation, were also blocked by concomitant treatment with jnki, further confirming jnk's role in aif-to-myf transdifferentiation.

hyperoxia-induced epithelial cell death and increased presence of myofibroblasts have been implicated in the pathogenesis of bpd  <cit> . since tgfβ <dig> has been recognized to be an important mediator in epithelial cell death and transformation to alveolar myofibroblasts in bpd  <cit> , we also evaluated the role of tgfβ <dig> in vitro and in developmentally-appropriate in vivo models in relation to hyperoxia and jnk pathway inhibition.

tgf-β <dig> and ctgf expression is increased in a <dig> lung cells on exposure to hyperoxia
since tgf-β <dig> and ctgf have been shown to be induced by hyperoxia, we decided to investigate if they were induced in our in vitro hyperoxia model. tgf-β <dig> and ctgf mrna expression were increased in a dose-dependent manner in a <dig> cells exposed to varying concentrations of hyperoxia  for  <dig> h .

in vivo inhibition of jnk pathway increases survival in hyperoxia-exposed nb wt and tgf-β <dig> tg mice
we used hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury model to test if the in vitro cell death protective response of the jnki could improve animal survival in vivo. we exposed nb wt and tgf-β <dig> tg mice on dox water to hyperoxia , with and without jnki. nb tgf-β <dig> tg mice had significantly increased mortality in hyperoxia, compared to litter-mate wt controls . nb wt and tgf-β <dig> tg, treated with daily injections of the jnki had significantly increased survival in hyperoxia , compared with their respective controls . thus, inhibition of the jnk pathway was protective in terms of survival in the hyperoxia-induced developing lung injury model.

in vivo inhibition of jnk pathway improves alveolarization in nb tgf-β <dig> tg mice in room air 
earlier reports have highlighted the role of the tgf-β signaling pathway in alveolarization of the developing lung. specifically, the nb tgf-β <dig> tg mouse lung has been shown to have impaired alveolarization in ra  <cit> . to assess the impact of inhibition of the jnk pathway in this process, we treated with daily injections of the jnk inhibitor, nb tgf-β <dig> tg mice on dox water from pn <dig> to pn <dig>  along with littermate wt controls. as noted in figures 5a and 5b, use of jnki, in the presence of tgf-β <dig> activation, improved alveolarization. however, the phenotype was only partially rescued, as evidenced by lung morphometry measurements . we also confirmed that total and p-jnk protein were increased with tgf-β <dig> activation and were decreased in the mice lung tissue when treated with jnki . to assess if these changes were secondary to mediators of the cell death pathway, we evaluated the mrna expression of caspase  <dig>  fas, and fas-l, in these lungs. we noted increased caspase  <dig>  fas, and fas-l, with exposure to tgf-β <dig> along with increased expression of ctgf mrna in the nb lungs on tgf-β <dig> activation. addition of jnki blocked this process. we confirmed our observations by quantification of the expression of ctgf, caspase- <dig>  fas and fas-l, as noted in figures 6a, b, c, and 6d, respectively. thus, tgf-β1-induced impaired alveolarization in ra is mediated, at least in part, by cell death pathway regulators acting via the jnk pathway in this in vivo model.

in vivo inhibition of jnk pathway did not impact on bal fluid tgf-β <dig> levels in nb tgf-β <dig> tg mice in room air
jnk pathway inhibition could alter tgf-β1-induced effects in the lung by altering the production of tgf-β <dig> or altering its effector capacity. to clarify this, we compared the levels of human tgf-β <dig> in bal fluids from wt and tg mice treated with jnki on regular or dox water, in ra. as can be seen in figure  <dig> similar levels of bal tgf-β <dig> were seen in tg mice with or without treatment with jnki, while on dox water, in ra. these measurements demonstrate that interventions that inhibit jnk pathway act by altering the tgf-β <dig> effector pathway , in our model.

in vivo inhibition of jnk pathway improves alveolarization in nb wt murine bpd model
as expected, the murine bpd mice lungs had large, simplified alveoli with significantly increased chord lengths . interestingly, inhibition of jnk pathway improved alveolarization . however, as evidenced by lung morphometry, the lung phenotype was only partially rescued. this suggests that hyperoxia-induced impaired alveolarization is mediated, at least in part, by regulators acting via the jnk pathway in this in vivo model, with one of these regulators being tgf-β <dig> 

discussion
studies were undertaken to test the hypothesis that the jnk pathway is an important regulator of hyperoxia-induced pulmonary responses. these studies demonstrate that hyperoxia inhibits cell proliferation, stimulates cell death, and alters myofibroblast transdifferentiation in a dose-dependent manner. these effects are significantly impacted by inhibiting the jnk pathway. furthermore, there is increased expression of tgf-β <dig> and ctgf, on exposure to hyperoxia, both of which are known to signal via the jnk pathway. our studies also demonstrate that hyperoxia-induced mortality and alveolarization are improved when the jnk pathway is inhibited, in the presence of excess tgf-β <dig> and ctgf, in the developing lung. when viewed in combination, these studies demonstrate that hyperoxia-induced cell death and tgf-β1-mediated pulmonary responses are mediated via signaling, at least in part, through the jnk pathway.

in our evaluation of varying concentrations of hyperoxia on cell death, all  <dig> concentrations of hyperoxia significantly reduced cell survival, compared to ra. we, however, could not discern any significant differences between the  <dig> concentrations of o <dig> on cell death. use of jnki was able to restore cell survival to ra values, in all  <dig> o <dig> concentrations. mle- <dig> cells exposed to 95% o <dig> had increased cell survival on inhibition of the jnk pathway  <cit> . using sirna against jnk <dig> in a <dig> cells exposed to 95% o <dig> decreased interleukin- <dig> expression, a pro-inflammatory cytokine  <cit> . data on cell viability were not reported in that study  <cit> . our data supports the contention that jnk pathway inhibition has a significant protective response in lung epithelial cells exposed to 95% o <dig>  in addition, we report the novel finding that such an effect is also noted at lower concentrations  of o <dig> in our in vitro model.

while hyperoxia-exposed decrease in cell proliferation in aif was not impacted upon by jnki, in line with the findings of hashimoto et al in human lung fibroblasts, we found that aif to myf transdifferentiation was blocked by inhibiting jnk activation  <cit> .

our studies show that the death-receptor pathway and the executioner caspase  <dig> are involved in the process of hyperoxia-induced epithelial cell death. these data are supported by an earlier report using mle- <dig> cells exposed to 95% o <dig>  <cit> . in addition, we also report the novel observation that jnki also impacts fas-l and caspase- <dig> protein in a <dig> lung epithelial cells exposed to 95% o <dig> 

to begin to understand the in vivo relevance of our findings, we selected tgf-β <dig> as our cytokine of interest for a variety of reasons. firstly, the jnk pathway has been implicated in tgf-β <dig> signaling in lung cells  <cit> , specifically ctgf  <cit>  and cell death  <cit>  as well as myofibroblast transformation  <cit> . secondly, hyperoxia has been shown to upregulate tgf-β <dig> in premature rat lungs  <cit> . hence, we first confirmed increased expression of tgf-β <dig> and ctgf in our in vitro model, before proceeding to test our hypothesis in the nb tgf-β <dig> tg mice.

in the hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury model, jnki administration was significantly protective in terms of survival in nb tgf-β <dig> tg mice. importantly, the survival of the nb wt mice treated with jnki was 100% after  <dig> days of 100% o <dig> exposure. this suggests that non-tgf-β1-dependent, but hyperoxia-induced molecular mediators signaling via the jnk pathway, are also involved.

since tgf-β <dig> has been implicated in bpd, we used the lung-specific overexpression model to evaluate the impact of jnki on alveolarization. we selected pn <dig> as the starting point as the mouse lung is in the alveolar phase at this time, and hyperoxia-induction of tgf-β <dig> was noted then  <cit> . we used a 3-day treatment duration, as it takes about  <dig> hours for the tgf-β <dig> induction by dox to be sustained in our tg model, as previously described  <cit> . expectedly, as previously described  <cit> , activation of tgf-β <dig> resulted in impaired alveolarization. inhibition of the jnk pathway was able to improve this to a significant extent, compared to appropriate controls . the improvement in alveolar architecture, however, was only partially corrected to appropriate control levels , as noted in figure  <dig>  this could be reflective of the short duration of treatment with jnki that was employed.

it is important to point out that jnki did not significantly alter the tgf-β <dig> levels in the bal fluid of the tg mice on dox water . hence, the effects noted above with jnki were due to effects downstream of tgf-β <dig> pathway activation.

to further assess the potential for clinical translation, we used the nb wt murine bpd model and found significant, but partial, improvement in lung morphometry with jnk pathway inhibition.

interestingly, a recent publication has reported lung-targeted conditional overexpression of ctgf to have a phenotype of bpd  <cit> . this data supports our findings of increased ctgf on tgf-β <dig> activation in the nb lung, which also has a phenotype of bpd  <cit> . importantly, we noted decreased expression of ctgf and cell death pathway regulators with jnk pathway inhibition association with improvement of the bpd phenotype in the nb tgf-β <dig> tg mice lungs.

in addition to inhibiting jnk, sp <dig> also inhibits erk 1/ <dig>  the evaluation of the role of erk 1/ <dig> in our modeling systems was beyond the scope of the present manuscript. there are few limitations of our study: first, while a <dig> cells mimic lung epithelial cells, it is a transformed cell line, and hence, may not mimic the effects of freshly-isolated lung epithelial cells or in vivo. second, the use of different strains of mice, at variable gestational ages, and different doses of jnk inhibitors can lead to significantly different results. to illustrate, in contrast to our findings, the jnk inhibitor sp <dig> at a dose of  <dig> μm, used in lung explants obtained from cd <dig> mice at embryonic day  <dig> , induced endogenous ctgf expression, tgfβ1-induced ctgf expression, increased dna fragmentation and cleaved caspase  <dig>  <cit> . adult jnk <dig> null mutant mice have been reported to have increased susceptibility to hyperoxia  <cit> . interestingly, in contrast, the same group of investigators reported that adult jnk <dig> null mutant mice were resistant to ventilation-induced lung injury  <cit> . in addition, adult rats treated with a jnki were protected from lps-induced lung injury  <cit> . hence, it is obvious that depending on the specific experimental conditions, the response to jnk inhibition can be quite variable.

in addition, another important factor to consider is the significant developmental regulation in the response of the developing lung to hyperoxia, versus the adult lung, as shown by us  <cit>  and other investigators  <cit> . this can be the potential explanation of the seemingly conflicting results of our studies versus those in jnk <dig> and jnk <dig> null mutant adult mice having increased lethality on exposure to hyperoxia  <cit> . we did, however use developmentally-appropriate nb mice for our in vivo work, in an attempt to mimic human bpd. this brings into focus the fact that independent confirmation of findings under appropriate and clinically relevant conditions must be undertaken, instead of extrapolating from in vitro or adult lung experimental results  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a schematic for the proposed mechanism for the effects noted in our experimental models is shown as figure  <dig>  to summarize, our in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate a role of the jnk pathway, at least in part, in hyperoxia-induced cell death, myofibroblast transdifferentiation, tgf-β1- and hyperoxia-mediated pulmonary responses.
