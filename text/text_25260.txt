BACKGROUND
canola  is an economically important crop in canada and other temperate regions, and is susceptible to adverse effects by fungal pathogens. among these, sclerotinia sclerotiorum, causing stem rot and alternaria brassicae, causing alternaria black spot, have potential to cause significant crop losses  <cit> . considerable efforts are underway to develop canola varieties that are better able to tolerate these pathogens. we have previously used proteomics and genomics to survey the global changes in gene expression that occur as a result of pathogen challenge in canola  <cit> .

plant defense responses include the transcriptional control of expression of stress-responsive genes  <cit> , including a number of transcription factors  whose abundance is altered as a result of the pathogen challenge. these tfs are presumably involved in regulating the expression of defense-related genes, and specifically include those containing ethylene response factor /apetala <dig> -domain, homeodomain, basic leucine zipper , myb, wrky families and other zinc-finger factors, all of which have been observed to increase in response to pathogen challenge  <cit> . these defense-associated tfs can regulate downstream defense-related genes, and may themselves be regulated by phosphorylation  <cit> .

the name of the wrky family itself is derived from the most prominent feature of these proteins, the wrky domain, which constitutes  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . in this wrky domain, a conserved wrkygqk heptapeptide is followed by a c2h2- or c2hc-type of zinc finger motif  <cit> . one or two wrky zinc-finger motifs may be present, which can bind to the w-box dna motif tgac  <cit> . furthermore, cis-elements other than ttgac have also been identified as a target of the wrky domain of a barley wrky tf  <cit> . the group i wrky tfs contain two wrky domains: the c-terminal domain that plays a major role in binding to the w-box, while the n-terminal wrky domain affects the binding affinity  <cit> .

wrky proteins belong to a super-family of zinc finger proteins  containing six members  <cit> . for example, genes coding wrky proteins were found not only in plants but also in the slime mold dictyostelium discoideum and the protist giardia lamblia, which indicates that wrkys may have evolved prior to the evolution of plant phyla  <cit> . some wrky functions are thought to be conserved between phylogenetically distant species  <cit> .

wrky tf genes form large families in plants, with  <dig> members in arabidopsis and close to  <dig> in oryza sativa   <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that wrky tfs are implicated in plant defense responses  <cit> , sugar signaling  <cit>  and chromatin remodeling  <cit> . furthermore, wrkys have been found to play essential roles in various normal physiological processes, including embryogenesis, seed coat and trichome development, senescence, regulation of biosynthetic pathways, and hormonal signaling  <cit> . as alluded to earlier, abiotic and biotic stresses are among the major external factors influencing the expression of wrky genes in plants  <cit>  and have been demonstrated to be involved in the defense against phytopathogens such as bacteria  <cit> ; fungi  <cit> ; and viruses  <cit> .

the responses of arabidopsis to pathogens have been observed to be mediated by signaling pathways  <cit> . for example, salicylic acid  plays a positive role in plants against biotrophic pathogens, whereas jasmonic acid/ethylene  appears to be important in the case of necrotrophic pathogens  <cit> . it is also known that these  signaling pathways are mutually antagonistic  <cit> . in arabidopsis, it was observed that  <dig> out of  <dig> atwrky genes are regulated by pseudomonas syringae or sa treatment  <cit> . on the other hand, of ja-responsive tf in arabidopsis, atwrky tfs are one of the greatest numbers of induced  <cit> . moreover, it is observed that cross-talk of sa- and ja-dependent defense response could be mediated by atwrky <dig>  which is downstream of nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related gene  <dig>   <cit> .

previous studies have shown that abscisic acid , a negative factor in the sa and ja/et signaling defense response, did not increase disease resistance  <cit> . however, recent research has demonstrated that aba has a positive effect on callose deposition, which could lead to increased resistance of plants towards some pathogens  <cit> . although wrky tfs have been demonstrated to be involved in abiotic stress and aba signaling  <cit> , there are no reports available on the role of wrkys in aba-mediated biotic stress responses. the role of other hormones, such as cytokinins, has been investigated by many groups and it was observed that cytokinins, serving as endogenous inducers for distinct classes of pathogenesis-related  proteins, are necessary for the biosynthesis of sa and ja  <cit> . others have observed that the effect of cytokinins is mediated through the stimulation of et production  <cit> . however, whether cytokinins induce the expression of pr genes through wrkys is not presently clear.

despite the obvious importance of wrkys in responses to pathogens and hormone signaling, there are no reports as of yet, describing wrky tfs in canola and their role in mediating responses to pathogens. in our previous microarray analysis of canola response to s. sclerotiorum, we identified three wrky genes whose transcript abundance was significantly affected by this fungus  <cit> . these results prompted us to systematically identify and examine wrky tf genes in canola using the large set of available expressed sequence tags . in this study, we analyzed ests from publicly available sequence information of canola and identified  <dig> sequences with similarities to arabidopsis wrky tfs. we investigated the evolutionary relationship of canola wrky tfs with their counterparts from arabidopsis and rice. we examined the subcellular localization of four bnwrky proteins using green fluorescent protein . subsequently, we studied the responses of representative members of monophyletically distinct wrky clades to two fungal pathogens, as well as five plant hormones, in order to gain further insights into their roles in canola defense responses.

RESULTS
identification of  <dig> wrky transcription factor genes in b. napus
although the complete sequence of the b. napus genome has not yet been determined, the number of publicly available ests was  <dig>  as of may  <dig>   <dig>  it is well known that gene discovery and genome characterization through the generation of ests is one of the most widely used methods  <cit> . a keyword search in ncbi "nr" dataset, returned only two previously annotated bnwrky sequences. we used blast alignments to search the dbest database and identified  <dig> unique genbank est accessions from b. napus that showed significant similarity to the  <dig> atwrky genes and  <dig> other wrky sequences. we then used estpass to remove four chimerical ests and clustered the remaining  <dig> ests into  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets. for subsequent analyses, we also identified the largest open reading frame of each of the  <dig> contigs or singlets using orfpredictor  <cit> . we also searched the dfci oilseed rape gene index  and identified  <dig> tentative consensuses  and  <dig> singlets, which consisted of  <dig> ests. we found that all  <dig> of the bngi ests were present within the  <dig> dbests we extracted from genbank. the differences in numbers of wrky ests from these databases can be explained by the fact that the number of entries in these databases are different, based on their release frequency. the shanghai database ,  <cit> ) is more recent, with a greater number of entries, and produced an additional number of wrky est's that were incorporated in the current study. we note that the est information available for canola is biased towards seed coat and embryo tissues, which likely limited our ability to identify a complete set of wrky genes for this species. as the contigs/singlets output from estpass were annotated based on their similarity to arabidopsis wrky genes, we were able to identify the presumptive orthologs of the respective canola wrky genes. therefore, we assigned names to each bnwrky  based on the name of the corresponding arabidopsis wrkys.

we noted that among all the bnwrky genes we annotated, bnwrky <dig> has the largest number  of ests, followed by bnwrky <dig> with a total of  <dig> ests, while bnwrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> have only one est each . to facilitate subsequent phylogenetic, gfp fusion, and qrt-pcr analyses, we designed primers based on the identified ests for each of the  <dig> bnwrky genes to obtain full length cdna sequences, at least for each of the coding regions, employing rt-pcr together with 3'race. as a result, we succeeded in cloning the cdna sequences of  <dig> of these  <dig> bnwrky genes, among which we identified two different alleles  for each of  <dig> bnwrky genes . we were also able to identify putative orthologs of these bnwrky genes in both arabidopsis and rice using the program inparanoid  <cit>  .

although wrky proteins have a conserved heptapeptide wrkygqk motif  <cit> , many studies have reported slight variations of the sequence for some wrky proteins in arabidopsis, rice, tobacco and barley  <cit> . similarly, a number of the bnwrkys we identified have amino acid sequence substitutions in their conserved wrky signatures. for example, the following variations were noted: wrkygkk in bnwrky <dig>  and wrkygrk in bnwrky <dig> . we also observed a  <dig> amino acid insertion in the c-terminal wrky domain of bnwrky <dig>  compared to atwrky <dig> . an examination of the cdna sequence of bn wryky <dig> revealed that the insert starts with tt and ends with gg, suggesting that it is most probably not an intron. usually the nucleotide sequence of the predominant class of introns begins with gt ends with ag and that of a minor class begins with at and ends with ac  <cit> , neither of which are true in this particular instance. our results thus suggest that bnwrky <dig> has diverged considerably during the evolutionary process.

phylogenetic analysis of bnwrky proteins
from the  <dig> canola wrky genes identified, we were able to extract  <dig> wrky domains that were each approximately  <dig> amino acids in length. in  <dig> bnwrky tf proteins, we identified two separate wrky domains , and both n- and c-terminal wrky domains of these proteins were included in the phylogenetic analysis. the wrky domain amino acid sequences were aligned with each other  and a consensus maximum parsimony  tree was inferred . subsequently, we reconstructed a rooted mp tree using a wrky protein from the world's smallest unicellular green algae ostreococcus tauri wrky as the outgroup . this tree demonstrates the polyphyletic nature of bnwrky tfs, which is consistent with previous studies  <cit> .

we next classified the bnwrky tfs we identified into three major groups using criteria that had been previously described for this family  <cit> . accordingly, the group ii proteins were further divided into five subgroups. from our study, at least two representatives for each subgroup of wrky proteins were identified in the canola genome . for example, twelve bnwrkys  code for proteins with two wrky domains and clearly cluster with group i of the atwrkys. the n- and c-terminal domains of these twelve bnwrky form two different clusters named group in and group ic . the  <dig> identified group ii wrky members of canola were distributed unevenly among the five subgroups  and this is in agreement with previous studies in arabidopsis, rice and barley  <cit> . two bnwrkys  formed a distinct subclade, iia, similar to the observations in a. thaliana  <cit> . five canola wrkys  belong to group iib; eight  belong to group iic; seven  belong to group iid; and six canola wrky  belong to group iie. group iii is represented by four single wrky domain canola proteins . the comparison of number of wrky genes in arabidopsis , rice , barley  and canola  within each of the wrky group/subgroups  showed that about 53–59% of the expected wrky genes of canola have been identified. it appears that within group iid, the same number of wrky genes from a. thaliana and canola have been identified whereas for other subgroups, additional bnwrky genes remain to be identified . our observations are similar to the study on the barley wrky gene family in which approximately 50% of the expected hvwrky genes were identified  <cit> .

according to a) eulgem et al.  <cit> , b) xie et al.  <cit> , ross et al.,  <cit> , and c) mangelsen et al.  <cit> .

to further explore the phylogenetic relationships between wrkys from canola and other species, we generated a phylogenetic tree incorporating all the wrkys we identified from arabidopsis, rice, and canola . these results are consistent with our proposed classification of the newly characterized wrkys from canola. however, in rice, there are four major groups of wrkys, i, ii, iii and iv  <cit>  and it can be observed that some members of the rice wrky family are scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree, an observation that has also been made previously  <cit> . for example, oswrky <dig>  is clustered with those from group i-n and oswrky <dig>  is clustered with those of group iii members . similarly, oswrky  <dig> and  <dig>  are clustered with group ii members . the three group iva wrkys  are scattered within branches of group ii and iii. interestingly, we observed that oswrky <dig>  is clustered with group iii instead of group ii as previously reported by others  <cit>  and, oswrky <dig> is clustered within group iii in our study, contrary to a previous report of this wrky being clustered within group i . these discrepancies may be due to the use of different algorithms  to generate the phylogenetic trees.

nuclear localization of four bnwrky proteins
the function of a tf normally requires that it is localized in the nucleus, although tfs targeting chloroplasts, mitochondria, or endoplasmic reticulum  have also been identified  <cit> . to confirm that the bnwrky tfs we identified are indeed targeted to the nucleus, we selected four bnwrky genes based on their known functions in mediating defense responses in arabidopsis  <cit>  for analysis in vivo. we fused the coding regions of bnwrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> to the n-terminus of synthetic green fluorescent protein   <cit>  and expressed them in arabidopsis under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus  35s promoter. analysis of conceptually translated bnwrky <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> coding sequences revealed the presence of a monopartite nuclear localization signal  , however, no nls was detected in the translated bnwrky <dig> sequence. we analyzed transgenic arabidopsis seedlings harboring the respective four constructs. in all four cases, green fluorescent signals were observed only in the nucleus . with the control vector alone, gfp signals were distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus . our results indicate that bnwrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are indeed nuclear-localized proteins, which is consistent with their predicted function as transcription factors.

expression analysis of bnwrky genes in response to fungal pathogens-s. sclerotiorum and a. brassicae
because the divergence of paralogous genes is often after the sub-functionalization  <cit> , we employed qrt-pcr to investigate the responses of representatives of each of the three major wrky clades. we selected  <dig> bnwrky genes, wrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  as representatives of each clade . after challenge with the fungal pathogen s. sclerotiorum, transcript abundance of  <dig> bnwrky genes was observed to be significantly  modulated with  <dig> being increased, two being decreased and one being decreased at  <dig> h but subsequently increased at  <dig> h . bnwrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> and <dig> were highly induced at  <dig> h after the inoculation. however, bnwrky <dig> and  <dig> were repressed by s. sclerotiorum infection. bnwrky <dig> was observed to be repressed at an earlier time point  but induced later .

we then examined the changes in transcript abundance of these  <dig> bnwrky genes in response to a second fungal pathogen, a. brassicae, which is also a necrotrophic pathogen. the symptom development in these two pathosystems  is different with respect to time required, with a. brassicae requiring a much longer period before visible disease symptoms could be observed . accordingly, the transcript abundance of only four bnwrky genes were significantly affected by a. brassicae with two  being significantly increased at  <dig> h post-pathogen challenge and two  with decreased transcript abundance . in summary, our results indicate that bnwrky <dig> and  <dig> are induced by both s. sclerotiorum and a. brassicae with bnwrky <dig> exhibiting a similar temporal pattern of changes in transcript abundance between the two fungi. however, bnwrky <dig> and  <dig> had different responses to s. sclerotiorum and a. brassicae. our results suggest that although both pathogens investigated in this study are necrotrophic, they elicit slightly different responses with respect to changes in transcript abundance of bnwrky genes.

response of selected bnwrky genes to hormone treatments
to investigate the hormonal control mechanisms underlying bnwrky gene expression, we treated canola plants with five phytohormones, ja, sa, aba, bap and et and analyzed the changes in transcript abundance of these  <dig> bnwrky genes using qrt-pcr. to ensure that the hormone applications were eliciting expected responses in plants, we first examined the responses of a few additional canola genes that are proposed to be orthologs of arabidopsis genes previously reported to respond to these hormones. these arabidopsis genes were two bzip transcription factors, tga <dig>  tga <dig> for sa  <cit> ; allene oxide cyclase   <cit>  and plant defensin  <dig>   for ja  <cit> ; ethylene insensitive  <dig>   <cit>  and ethylene responsive factor   <cit>  for et; aba insensitive  <dig>   <cit>  for aba, and arabidopsis response regulator  <dig>   <cit>  and cytokinin response  <dig>   <cit>  for bap. we observed that the abundance of transcripts for all of these genes was significantly increased in response to the hormone treatments , confirming the efficacy of our hormone treatments.

our results demonstrated that among the  <dig> bnwrky genes studied, bnwrky <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were induced by et and bnwrky <dig> was repressed by aba at  <dig> h . in contrast, bnwrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were repressed by bap at  <dig> h . at  <dig> h, bnwrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were specifically induced by et and bnwrky <dig> was repressed by et . three bnwrky genes exhibited modulation of expression in response to two hormones . at  <dig> h, both ja and et repressed bnwrky <dig> and both et and bap repressed bnwrky <dig>   <dig> and <dig> . however, none of the genes were observed to be affected by the two hormones at  <dig> h. in addition, both aba and bap repressed bnwrky <dig> . none of these bnwrky genes were affected by three or more hormones .

results are presented as a ratio of transcript abundance in treatment/mock on a linear scale. data were mean of three biological replicates ± s.e. the asterisk indicates that the corresponding gene was significantly up- or down-regulated under a stress treatment by t-test .

as indicated earlier, ja and sa are important signaling molecules which are implicated in plant defense responses  <cit> ; and other phytohormones, through their effect on sa or ja signaling, may influence disease outcomes  <cit> . bnwrky <dig> was observed to be repressed by ja at  <dig> h although no significant change was observed at  <dig> h . in response to sa treatment, we observed that the transcript abundance for seven genes  exhibited modulation at  <dig> h and three  at  <dig> h , however, these observed changes were not statistically significant.

in summary, sa did not significantly affect the transcript abundance of any of the bnwrkys tested, whereas et, aba, ja and the cytokinin bap did affect the transcript abundance of various bnwrky genes investigated in this study . although the  <dig> genes tested did not show significant changes in expression levels after exogenous treatments with sa, there is the possibility that other bnwrky genes may be responsive to sa.

discussion
in this study, we describe the identification and annotation of cdna sequences of  <dig> members of the wrky gene family in canola and their classification into groups i to iii . among the  <dig> bnwrky genes identified, both the hallmark wrkygqk motif  and its variants  were identified in the translated amino acid sequences while that of bnwrky <dig> waits to be identified . a recent study demonstrated that atwrky tfs bearing the wrkygqk motif exhibit binding site preferences, which are partly dependent on the adjacent dna sequences outside of the ttgacy-core motif  <cit> . for those wrky tfs that do not contain the canonical wrkygqk motif, a binding sequence other than the w-box element tgac) may exist. for instance, the binding sequence of tobacco  ntwrky <dig> with a wrkygkk motif is ttttccac, which deviates significantly from w-box  <cit> . moreover, soybean  gmwrky <dig> and gmwrky <dig> lose the ability to bind to a w-box containing the variant wrkygkk motif  <cit> . it seems likely that the bnwrky tfs that lack the canonical wrkygqk motif might not be able to interact with w-box and therefore may have different target genes and possibly divergent roles, a proposal that must be verified in future studies. finally, mutation of amino acid q to k of atwrky <dig> was observed to affect binding activity with the consensus w-box  <cit> . furthermore, the second characteristic feature of wrky proteins is a unique zinc-finger motif c-x4–5-c-x22–23-h-x-h  <cit> . of the  <dig> bnwrky domains, most of them contain this unique zinc-finger motif while bnwrky <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  have an extended zinc-finger motif which is c-x7-c-x23-h-x-c. this observation is consistent with previous study in arabidopsis  <cit> , barley  <cit>  and rice  <cit> .

complete or partial wrky domains are found in ests from many species of land plants  <cit> . recently,  <dig> wrky genes were identified in the moss, physcomitrella patens  <cit> . so far, no wrky genes have been identified in the archaea, eubacteria, fungi, or animal lineages  <cit> . however, in the genomes of the protist, giardia lamblia and the slime mold, dictyostelium discoideum, a single wrky gene with two wrky domains were recently identified  <cit> . further examination of the two wrky domains existing in the two organisms indicates that g. lamblia wrky tf has a wrkygsk heptapeptide at its n-terminal and a wkkyghk at its c-terminal, whereas in d. discoideum, both wrky domains have a classical wrkygqk heptapeptide  <cit> . this suggests an ancient origin of the canonical wrkygqk heptapeptide and its variants. in the green algae, chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a wrky tf containing two wrky domains  was also identified  <cit> . in the genome of the recently sequenced, world's smallest free-living eukaryote, the unicellular chlorophytic algae, ostreococcus tauri, a wrky gene containing a single wrky domain and a wrkygck heptapeptide is also present .

the identification of wrky genes in primitive eukaryotes suggests an ancient origin of the wrky family, and this family had emerged before the evolution and diversification of the plant phyla  <cit> . during the long evolutionary history, the wrky gene family greatly expanded, as demonstrated by the increased numbers of wrky genes in higher plants  <cit> , and this expansion may be primarily due to segmental duplications of genomic fragments as a result of independent polyploidy events  <cit> . comparison of a genomic region harboring five genes, one of which is wrky <dig>  between tomato, arabidopsis and capsella rubella, has revealed a great degree of microsynteny between closely and distantly related dicotyledonous species  <cit> . in addition, atwrky <dig>  with one wrky domain, is clustered within group i atwrkys possessing two-domains  <cit> . the ortholog of atwrky <dig> in tomato or rice  contains two wrky domains, which may suggest that during evolution, the n-terminal domain has been lost and the occurrence of the loss of the n-terminal wrky domain of atwrky <dig> is after the divergence of monocots and dicots  <cit> .

an overall genomic duplication event has been identified to exist in the tribe brassiceae after a comparative genomic analysis, and many genomic units that are conserved between canola and arabidopsis have also been identified  <cit> . we observed brassicaeceae-specific clades and rice-specific clades based on our current analysis. in group iii, arabidopsis wrky domains  form brassicaeceae-specific clade while rice wrky domains  also form rice-specific clade . similar to that observed by  <cit> , some monocot-specific clades were observed in groups iic and iii wrky domains of rice and barley. this further supports the conclusion by mangelsen et al.  <cit>  about the occurrence of this diversification after the divergence of mono- and di-cotyledonous plants. possibly more brassicaeceae-specific wrky clades could be indentified from future phylogenetic analysis after the whole genome of canola has been determined. a further comparative genomic analysis of the wrky-containing regions between canola and arabidopsis should enable us to reveal the extent of microcolinearity between these closely related species and a better understanding of the expansion of the wrky gene family in canola.

wrky tfs are involved in the regulation of various biological processes, including pathogen responses and hormone signaling  <cit> . a previous expression analysis of atwrky genes demonstrated that nearly 70% are differentially expressed by pathogen infection or sa treatment, suggesting important roles for wrky in defense responses  <cit> . recently, two studies of the rice wrky genes also demonstrated that many are responsive to ja, sa and aba treatments  <cit> . increased transcript abundance of sa- and ja-responsive genes is essential for the induced resistance conferred by the two signaling pathways  <cit> . wrky tfs are also reported to participate in disease resistance in arabidopsis and tobacco through modulation of sa- or ja-responsive gene expression similar to that induced by the tga class of basic leucine-zipper transcription factors  <cit> .

previous studies from our laboratory as well as those of others revealed that few genes related to sa-signaling were modulated by infection of canola with s. sclerotiorum  <cit> , suggesting that sa does not play a crucial role in mediating responses of canola to this pathogen. the responses of arabidopsis to a. brassicicola, which causes black spot in canola as a. brassicae does, also appear to be mediated through ja instead of sa  <cit> , which is similar to responses to other necrotrophic fungi, including pythium species  <cit> . hence, it is possible that wrky tfs may play an important role in suppressing the involvement of sa in response to those pathogens. this suggestion is consistent with the conclusion that atwrky <dig>  which is induced by many pathogens, acts as a positive regulator of ja- and et-mediated defense signaling but as a negative regulator of sa-mediated responses  <cit> . as mentioned earlier, both a. brassicae as well as s. sclerotiorum are able to induce bnwrky <dig>  one of the genes belonging to group i. moreover, it has been demonstrated that pathogen-induced atwrky <dig> expression does not require sa signaling  <cit> . similar to atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig> acts as a negative regulator of the sa-mediated signaling pathway  <cit> . the increased abundance of bnwrky <dig> due to the infection by s. sclerotiorum, but not in the case of a. brassicae challenge, also suggests that it might also work as a negative regulator of sa-related signaling pathways in the canola-s. sclerotiorum pathosystem, but not in the canola-a. brassicae pathosystem. of the other group i members investigated in our study, , bnwrky <dig> was observed to be significantly induced by s. sclerotiorum only at  <dig> h , and bnwrky <dig> and  <dig> were repressed by s. sclerotiorum , indicating the differences in behavior of group i bnwrkys in response to fungal pathogens .

it is possible that several bnwrky tfs may also be involved in signaling the responses of canola to the pathogens s. sclerotiorum and a. brassicae. for instance, group iia members have been demonstrated to play both positive and negative roles in plant defense  <cit> . the transcript levels of two genes of the group iia: bnwrky <dig>  and  <dig>  orthologs of which are known to act as negative regulators of plant defense in arabidopsis  <cit> , were observed to increase in response to s. sclerotiorum and a. brassicae challenge. for a. brassicae, the differences in transcript abundance between controls and inoculated plants were not statistically significant . in addition, it has been reported that atwrky <dig>  one member of the group iib, acts as a positive regulator of the senescence- and pathogen defense-associated pr <dig> promoter activity, and is also induced by sa and bacterial infection  <cit> . since leaf senescence is often linked to plant defense  <cit> , the induction of bnwrky <dig> by s. sclerotiorum, aba and sa at an early time-point  but not a. brassicae, may suggest a role in leaf senescence, which is observed very early in the s. sclerotiorum-canola pathosystem .

we also observed that group iic  and iii  bnwrkys in our study were all induced by the infection of s. sclerotiorum and et whereas bnwrky <dig> was induced only by a. brassicae . changes in expression of bnwrky <dig> induced by both pathogens suggest that an et-mediated signaling pathway may be involved in mediating the responses of canola to necrotrophic pathogens. in arabidopsis growing in 1/ <dig> × ms liquid media supplemented with  <dig> μm of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate , it has been previously observed that atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> were induced; while atwrky <dig> was repressed compared to untreated controls  <cit> . this differences between the expression of atwrky <dig>  <cit>  and bnwrky <dig>  in response to et treatment may be the result of subtle differences in experiments including the use of different tissues , and/or the ethylene-generating reagents  used. further studies on the role of these three bnwrky tfs in mediating defense responses are ongoing in our laboratory.

although bnwrky <dig>  was not affected by either s. sclerotiorum or a. brassicae in this study, our previous microarray profiling of transcriptome changes in canola as a result of s. sclerotiorum infection revealed that transcript levels of bnwrky <dig> and  <dig> increased while that of bnwrky <dig> decreased at specific time points, although the magnitude of response was less than two-fold  <cit> . arabidopsis atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> are both known to act as negative defense regulators and wrky <dig> appears to act upstream of ja  <cit>  since it does not respond to ja  <cit> . however, the expression of atwrky <dig> has been reported to correlate with the induction of the ja biosynthesis enzymes aos and lox  <dig> h after challenge with p. syringae  <cit> . incidentally, the accumulation of ja also occurs within the first hour of the interaction with p. syringae  <cit> . taken together with our observations that bnwrky <dig> was repressed by ja and et treatments at  <dig> h, and was not induced by the pathogens, it is possible that the pathogen-induced accumulation of ja might modulate the expression of bnwrky <dig> 

given the recently emerging role for aba in defense responses  <cit> , it is possible that aba exerts some of these effects through the modulation of bnwrky genes, specifically bnwrky <dig> and bnwrky <dig>  similarly, the cytokinin bap has been implicated in both alleviating and exacerbating the hypersensitive response , which is characterized by tissue necrosis and is frequently accompanied by the subsequent induction of systemic acquired resistance  throughout the plant  <cit> . furthermore, cytokinins can promote the susceptibility of biotrophs by inducing the necrotroph resistance pathway, which is responsive to ja/et  <cit> . as suggested for aba mediated plant defense responses, it is possible that the bnwrkys, which were observed to be modulated by exogenous bap application, may be responsible, at least in part, for mediating the observed effects with the necrotrophic pathogens.

based on our previous and current studies, we propose a model outlining the possible roles of bnwrky tfs in mediating the responses of canola to s. sclerotiorum and phytohormones . both s. sclerotiorum and ja/et can induce bnwrky <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> at  <dig> h post inoculation and possibly activate the downstream ja/et signaling pathway at later time points . s. sclerotiorum specifically induces bnwrky <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and ja/et specifically induce bnwrky <dig> and  <dig> at  <dig> h post inoculation . this may be explained by the more complicated molecular patterns generated by s. sclerotiorum during the infection compared to the application of ja or et only. bnwrky <dig> in this study is also found to negatively regulate ja/et defense genes, and it is possibly positively regulated by sa , which could lead to interference with the ja/et signaling pathway. this is consistent with previous report of atwrky <dig> being the node of convergence of ja and sa signaling  <cit> . it is also possible that bnwrky <dig> modulates the expression of pr <dig> gene, culminating in cell death , which is conducive for the growth of necrotrophic fungi  <cit> , a hypothesis that must be tested in the future. a mitogen-activated protein kinase  gene, mpk <dig>  was also observed to be induced at  <dig> h and  <dig> h post inoculation in our previous study  <cit> . mpk <dig> in arabidopsis has been demonstrated to positively regulate atwrky22/ <dig>  <cit> , . similar to atwrky <dig> and  <dig>  bnwrky <dig> and  <dig>  may act as a positive regulators of ja- and et-mediated defense signaling pathways and as negative regulators of the sa-mediated signaling pathway  <cit>  . further work needs to be performed to characterize orthologs of atwrky <dig> and  <dig> in canola, and to examine the relationship between mapk signaling cascade and bnwrkys. moreover, a detailed functional characterization of bnwrky tfs, using a variety of reverse genetic techniques, in the context of s. sclerotiorum response, will help to better delineate their physiological roles.

as discussed above for b. napus-s. sclerotiorum pathosystem and function of related atwrky gene, several wrky factors act as negative regulators of plant defense whereas others positively modulate this response implying their association with distinct regulatory complexes. functional redundancy in defense programs is an inherent feature of wrky genes  <cit>  and it may reflect a strong need to backup essential regulatory functions  <cit> . still, we can expect exciting novel revelations about wrky tfs in the very near future on the basis of the enormous progress made within the past two years.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we identified  <dig> bnwrky tfs based on the publicly available est resources of canola and cloned the cdna sequences for  <dig> of them. we characterized the responses of  <dig> selected genes, based on their phylogenetic relationship in response to two fungal pathogens and five hormone treatments. based on our data, we propose that bnwrky tfs might play an important role in plant defense response, possibly by acting as positive or negative regulators of plant defense, and canola may respond differently to s. sclerotiorum and a. brassicae from bnwrky mediated plant defense system. our results also confirm that there is cross-talk between biotic stress and hormone signaling. functional redundancy in defense programs is an inherent feature of wrky genes  <cit>  and future studies will be directed towards delineating the specific roles of individual wrky tfs in those and related pathosystems in order to explore the possibility that manipulation of abundance of one or several of these proteins may lead to durable and robust resistance to the pathogen, apart from contributing to our understanding of the molecular processes that occur during host-pathogen interactions.
