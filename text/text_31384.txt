BACKGROUND
ancient chinese medical books suggest that an anthrax-like disease has been present in china for more than  <dig>  years and that by 500– <dig> a.d. the epidemiology and symptoms of anthrax had been described  <cit> . a  <dig> report from china described the results of an anthrax surveillance and control project in  <dig> provinces in china between 1990– <dig>  <cit> . stations in these  <dig> provinces  reported  <dig> outbreaks and  <dig>  human cases of anthrax. these results, which are indicative of a long history and significant levels of contamination in these specific areas, are the reason for concern by the chinese institute of epidemiology and microbiology  <cit> .

the population structure of bacillus anthracis has only recently begun to be resolved with specific geographical patterns spread across areas mostly inhabited by man and his animals. higher genetic resolution within b. anthracis has resulted from two molecular typing approaches: an ongoing comparative, single nucleotide polymorphism  analysis of diverse isolates that describes a conserved, clonally derived basal tree,  <cit>  and a multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis  system that provides improved resolution among individual isolates  <cit> . this process for molecular typing has now been applied to the study of isolates from china.

an archival collection of  <dig> b. anthracis isolates from china  was obtained and used in this study . this collection contained an unusual subset of  <dig> b. anthracis isolates recovered from soil, including  <dig> isolates collected between 1981/ <dig> in xinjiang province. this province is located in the western most tip of china and was one of the  <dig> regions surveyed in the study conducted from 1990– <dig>  the remaining isolates originated from many regions across the whole of china. this report focuses on the molecular genotyping of these  <dig> isolates. our goal was to determine the nature and distribution of genotypes found in china and to establish phylogenetic relationships between these isolates and those found elsewhere in the world.

canonical snp analysis
the original comparative analysis of  <dig> b. anthracis whole genome sequences examined the status of ~ <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  in  <dig> diverse isolates  <cit> . this study revealed an extremely conserved phylogenetic tree with only one homoplastic character in ~ <dig>  measurements. these results prompted the hypothesis that a few strategically placed "canonical snps" could replace the  <dig>  assays and still describe an accurate snp based tree. this idea was confirmed in a study using  <dig> canonical snps  to examine  <dig>  world-wide isolates of b. anthracis  <cit> . figure  <dig> illustrates this original cansnp tree and is used here to define important nomenclature and terminology.

the basic tree is now defined by  <dig> sequenced genomes that form  <dig> sub-branches or sub-lineages ending in "stars" in figure  <dig>  each of these sub-lineages is designated by the nomenclature from the whole genome sequence site in genbank, e.g. a.br ames, a.br.wna , and a.br.vollum. the relative position of each cansnp is indicated by vertical script and a small arrow and is arbitrarily defined, e.g., as a.br. <dig> where a refers to the major subgroup and  <dig> is the first cansnp . in this case the derived a.br. <dig> snp defines all isolates that are on the same branch as the sequenced ames strain. in addition to these  <dig> sub-lineages the analysis of  <dig> diverse isolates uncovered  <dig> nodes or sub-groups along the branches of this tree. four of these nodes are in the major a branch and one is in the b branch . these nodes are defined by the two cansnps on either side of the node position, e.g. a.br.001/ <dig> or a.br.008/ <dig>  all of the initial  <dig>  isolates in the van ert study  <cit>  were placed into one and only one of these  <dig> sub-lineages or sub-groups.

RESULTS
cansnp analysis of isolates from china
the  <dig> b. anthracis isolates from china were distributed into only five of these  <dig> cansnp sub-lineages/sub-groups described by van ert et al.  <cit> . these cansnp groups were a.br.vollum, a.br.aust. <dig>  a.br.001/ <dig>  a.br.ames, and a.br.008/ <dig> . four of the sub-lineages/sub-groups  were found in the western province of china, xinjiang . but only isolates from a.br.001/ <dig> sub-group and the close relative a.br.ames sub-lineage were found scattered throughout the other regions of china from east to west. these findings clearly suggest  <dig> or  <dig> separate introductions of b. anthracis into or out of china, with  <dig> possibly involving the routes defined as the silk road.

the a.br.008/ <dig> sub-group is a cluster that predominates throughout europe, the middle east and china. xinjiang province had  <dig> of the worldwide total of  <dig> a.br.008/ <dig> isolates . this province also had  <dig> of  <dig> worldwide isolates of the a.br.aust <dig> isolates. this is a sub-group that is also well represented in neighboring turkey and india. a smaller subset of the a.br.vollum sub-lineage  accounts for  <dig> xinjiang samples out of a worldwide set that totals  <dig> isolates .

the remainder of china is dominated by the a.br.001/ <dig> subgroup. chinese isolates represent  <dig> of the  <dig> isolates from our worldwide collection of a.br.001/ <dig> sub-group isolates . only  <dig> of these isolates are from xinjiang province to the west. similarly there are  <dig> isolates out of  <dig> worldwide isolates in the a.br.ames sub-lineage in the main parts of china.

mlva analysis of a.br.008/ <dig>  a.br.aust <dig> and a.br.vollum
cansnp typing of these isolates has already indicated that there were  <dig> total chinese isolates from the a.br.008/ <dig> subgroup,  <dig> from the a.br.aust <dig> sub-lineage and  <dig> from the a.br.vollum . additional sub-typing using  <dig> mlva markers indicates that there were only  <dig> mlva genotypes within both the a.br.vollum  and a.br.aust <dig>  sub-lineages but  <dig> mlva genotypes within a.br.008/ <dig> . these results suggest repeated infections and outbreaks for each of these sub-groups of b. anthracis. the identification of  <dig> genotypes for the a.br.008/ <dig> sub-groups is an indication of a combination of possibly repeated introductions and infections and a significantly longer history for this particular clade in this region.

branch collapse and ongoing snp analysis
one of the more remarkable findings from the whole genome snp analysis of  <dig> diverse isolates by pearson et al.  <cit>  was a nearly total lack of homoplastic snp markers in a query of the status of nearly  <dig>  snp positions in  <dig> diverse isolates. this finding uncovered a phenomenon called "branch collapse" that resulted in a tree that had no branching except for those created by  <dig> sequenced reference genomes. the remaining  <dig> isolates were then either part of one of these seven "sub-lineages" or part of  <dig> non-branching nodes  on one of the  <dig> branches. while the cansnp tree is highly accurate in the typing of  <dig> isolates, it lacks resolution because it reflects the results of only  <dig> of nearly  <dig>  snps.

improved resolution between two points was demonstrated by an extensive analysis of the ames specific branch  <cit>  when the status of  <dig> snps that define this branch were determined for the original  <dig> ames-like isolates. these analyses have a direct bearing on the isolates from china that are either ames-like or part of the a.br.001/ <dig> sub-group . the extended analysis of the snps on the ames branch indicate that there are  <dig> chinese isolates in the a.br.001/ <dig> sub-group and  <dig> additional chinese isolates  that form three new nodes or collapsed branch points between a.br.001/ <dig> and the ames isolate . in addition, there is a fourth node closest to the ames strain that contains  <dig> ames-like isolates from texas, one goat and  <dig> bovine isolates  <cit>  shown in figure  <dig> and an additional  <dig> ames-like isolates from the cdc . the precise location for the recovery of these latter isolates is unknown except that they originated in texas. these  <dig> isolates  and the ames strain represent a highly resolved, snp based a.br.ames sub-lineage. these results indicate that the original ames strain and a subset of  <dig> texas isolates are decendents of a rare lineage that is otherwise only found in china.

mlva: a.br.001/002
the  <dig> marker mlva analysis  of the  <dig> isolates belonging to the a.br.001/ <dig> sub-group yielded  <dig> different genotypes . this high diversity index is an indication that this sub-group, spread throughout the whole of china , is another sub-group of b. anthracis with a long and extensive evolutionary presence in china.

discussion
human anthrax has been an old and continuous problem in many rural regions in china where as much as six percent of environmental samples have been found to be contaminated with b. anthracis  <cit> . an archival collection of  <dig> b. anthracis isolates was obtained from china and canonical snp typing indicated that only  <dig> of the  <dig> worldwide sub-lineages/sub-groups of this pathogen were represented in this collection. one striking feature of the distribution of these b. anthracis isolates within this country was the discovery that three of the five cansnps sub-lineages/groups  are predominantly found in the western most chinese province of xinjiang. the previous observation  <cit>  that these three sub-lineages/sub-groups are prominent genotypes in india, pakistan, turkey and most of europe suggest a likely transmission pattern for anthrax along the ancient trade route known as the silk road  <cit>  that extended from europe, the middle east, portions of asia and into xinjiang province and the whole of china, figure  <dig> 

more specifically,  <dig> isolates were recovered from "soil samples" between 1981– <dig> from unspecified sites relatively close to the city of kashi in this province. kashi  was a major "oasis" crossroads city along the ancient silk road and dates back more than  <dig>  years  <cit> . consistent with the idea that the life cycle of b. anthracis can be maintained by viable spores in previously contaminated areas, the later 1990– <dig> surveillance project in china described three regions in xinjiang province where severe anthrax outbreaks had previously occurred  <cit> . two of these towns, zepu and atushi, are located approximately  <dig> and  <dig> kilometers respectively from the city of kashi. in the 1990– <dig> study, zepu recorded  <dig> villages with  <dig> human infections and atushi recorded  <dig> villages with  <dig> human infections.

despite a clear correlation between cansnp genotypes from the a radiation and the spectrum of isolates found across the trans-eurasian continents, there is one set of genotypes in europe that are clearly missing in china. these are representatives from the b branch that appear to be prevalent in several european states including at least  <dig> b <dig> isolates from france and isolates identified in both the b <dig> and b <dig> branches from croatia, germany, poland, italy, norway and slovakia  <cit> . it is not obvious why examples of the b branch are limited mostly to africa, this region of europe and a small location in california, usa. aside from sampling issues the b branch does not appear to have participated in the world-wide, dynamic radiation that has characterized the a branch  <cit> .

additional analyses with the rapidly evolving mlva markers suggest that establishment in china of two of these sub-groups/sub-lineages, a.br.aust <dig> and a.br.vollum, resulted from relatively recent events . in both of these instances, a sizeable number of isolates  are clustered into only three different mlva <dig> genotypes . although these results may reflect a certain sampling bias, the mlva comparison to other worldwide isolates from this branch indicates that the a.br.aust <dig> sub-lineage in china is most closely related to isolates recovered from the large  <dig> outbreak in victoria, australia . the precise origin and time-scale for this exchange is not certain but relatively recent exchanges between the far east and australia appear to have originated from india  <cit> , which could represent a common ancestor or an intermediate step in the transmission route.

by direct contrast the mlva analysis of  <dig> isolates belonging to the a.br.008/ <dig> sub-group revealed a more complex pattern with  <dig> different mlva <dig> genotypes . this is a remarkable finding because it indicates that a variety of mlva genotypes are persisting in the different soils from which the a.br.008/ <dig> isolates were recovered. these results are an indication that a.br.008/ <dig>  a major sub-group in europe and asia  <cit> , has had an extensive history in china. it is difficult to determine the precise origins of the a.br.008/ <dig> subgroup  at this point because rapidly evolving mlva markers are subject to homoplasy and potentially inaccurate phylogenetic reconstructions. these issues can eventually be resolved using additional whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic inference to more accurately predict the origins of the a.br.008/ <dig> sub-group.

the ames sub-lineage appears to have descended from the a.br.001/ <dig> sub-group, a sub-group that has  <dig> isolates in our worldwide collection  <cit> . seventy-four of these accessions were isolated from outbreaks in china and the remaining  <dig> isolates were recovered in the uk, other parts of europe, north america and other parts of asia. the large number of mlva <dig> genotypes  among the  <dig> chinese isolates and a wide distribution throughout the country indicates that the a.br.001/ <dig> sub-group is a major part of the b. anthracis population structure in this region . this sub-group also appears to be basal to the ames sub-lineage, indicating that  <dig> isolates from china and  <dig> isolates from texas may share common ancestors that originated in china .

how then did the ames lineage come to texas and why is this lineage not found in europe? this is still not known and subject to considerable speculation. by several accounts, it is believed that anthrax was introduced into the gulf coast states  by early settlers from europe. stein  <cit>  indicates that the first recorded episodes of anthrax in livestock in louisiana occurred in  <dig>   <dig> and 1884; and in texas in  <dig> and  <dig>  by  <dig>  when a first national survey was conducted to obtain nation-wide information on the incidence of anthrax, texas already had  <dig> counties reporting infections. a composite of outbreaks compiled after the 4th national survey by the u.s. department of agriculture between 1916– <dig>  indicates three major outbreak pockets: one in california, one in the dakotas/nebraska and the third along the coastal regions of texas and louisiana  <cit> .

an important feature of the outbreaks in texas is that the "modern" outbreaks have occurred repeatedly in many of the same counties depicted in this historical map . a culture-confirmed study between 1974– <dig> indicated that  <dig> isolates were spread across  <dig> texas counties  that are in general agreement with the dispersal patterns observed in the early national surveys depicted in figure  <dig>  the one significant difference is a shift from the historical outbreaks in the coastal regions to counties more central and southwesterly in "modern" times. similarly, culture-confirmed isolates from a  <dig> outbreak in val verde, edwards, real, kinney and uvalde counties in southwest texas are similar to outbreaks in  <dig> and  <dig> when  <dig> ames-like isolates were recovered from real, kinney, and uvalde county  <cit> .

it appears that b. anthracis was introduced into the gulf coast, probably by early european settlers or traders through new orleans and/or galveston during the early to mid 1800s. the disease became established along the coastal regions and then became endemic to the regions of texas where cattle and other susceptible animals are currently farmed. are these b. anthracis, ames-like genotypes from the big bend region  of texas representative of the ancestral isolates brought to the gulf coast? van ert et al.  <cit>  used synonymous snp surveys to estimate the divergence times between the major groups of b. anthracis and these estimates suggest that the western north american and the ames lineages shared common ancestors between  <dig>  and  <dig>  years ago. extrapolating to the much shorter snp distances between the most recent chinese isolate  and the recent texas isolates on the ames sub-lineage would approximate that these two shared a common ancestor between  <dig> to  <dig> years ago. these estimates would be consistent with the hypothesis that an ames-like isolate was introduced into the galveston and/or new orleans area in the early to middle 1800s.

this relatively recent expansion is in direct contrast to analyses of the western north american  sub-lineage that appears to have an ancient and significantly longer evolutionary presence in north america; this group stretches from the central regions of canada and into north and south dakota . phylogenetic reconstruction of >  <dig> western north american isolates indicates that the more ancestral isolates of this sub-lineage are found in the upper reaches of central canada and portrays a migration pattern where the youngest isolates are found in cattle outbreaks in north/south dakota and nebraska. kenefic, pearson et al.  <cit>  suggest that the ancestral isolates may have entered the north american continent via the beringian straights  <dig>  years ago.

a recent ecological niche model suggests that natural anthrax outbreaks are "concentrated in a narrow corridor from southwest texas northward into the dakotas and minnesota"  <cit> . this model indicates that conditions like vegetation, precipitation and altitude along this corridor are suited for maintaining naturally occurring anthrax outbreaks in livestock and wildlife. although historical records provide evidence that validate this model, there is a molecular and genotyping anomaly: there does not appear to be a direct epidemiological link between the "younger" ames-like cluster and the western north american lineage. despite nearly  <dig> years of monitoring since the first national outbreak tabulations  <cit> , there is still a clear physical division between the ames-like isolates to the south and the western north american lineage to the north . this gap is not obvious until the spatial patterns are examined in hindsight of the genetic discontinuity. these observations probably reflect the awareness and controls that were being observed for anthrax outbreaks as the us entered the 20th century.

limited sample analysis of isolates from the texas/louisiana coastline prevents any conclusions about the overall dominance of the ames sub-lineage in this area and we also cannot exclude the possibility that there are other sub-groups/sub-lineages that might have been imported and even become transiently established along the texas/louisiana gulf region during this same time frame.

CONCLUSIONS
despite containing only  <dig> of the initial  <dig> cansnp genotypes used to define a collection of world-wide isolates  <cit> , the analysis of  <dig> chinese b. anthracis isolates reveals an interesting impact on global distribution. the major diversity in these isolates is concentrated in the western province of xinjiang and especially the city of kashi, the hub of the silk road around the taklimakan desert into and out of china. these results reinforce the idea that this silk road region was central to the spread of anthrax between the trans-eurasian continents.

in addition to the three distinct sub-groups found in the western xinjiang province, the central and eastern regions of china are dominated by a different, highly diverse, cansnp sub-group, a.br.001/ <dig>  this sub-group is a major presence in relationship to our world-wide collection since 70% of all the isolates and most of the diversity for this sub-group were in this chinese collection. these results suggest that the a.br.001/ <dig> cluster may have originated in china. finally, the ames and ames-like strains in texas are descended from common ancestors in inner mongolia in china as an extension of this sub-group. it is curious that this lineage would become established in texas, and perhaps louisiana, and not in europe. this leaves behind a missing historical gap within the phylogeography of the ames lineage.
