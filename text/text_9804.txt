BACKGROUND
transcription factors are dna-binding proteins that regulate gene expression by binding to promoter regions proximal to gene transcription start sites  or to more distal enhancer regions that regulate expression through long-range interactions  <cit> . transcription factor binding varies between cell types, and one major factor contributing to this cell type-specific binding is chromatin structure. chromatin consists of dna wrapped around nucleosomes, and chains of nucleosomes linked by dna are organised structurally into different domains of accessible  and inaccessible  chromatin  <cit> . chromatin accessibility is regulated by dna methylation and posttranslational modifications in the n-terminal tails of the nucleosomal histone proteins. although there are no known combinations of modifications that delineate accessible and closed chromatins, histone acetylation and mono-, di- and trimethylation of lysine  <dig> on histone h <dig>  are generally associated with accessible chromatin, whereas h3k9me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> are associated with closed chromatin. several other modifications coexist with these marks over different domains  <cit> , but these modifications are generally less characterised.

although the interplay between chromatin environments and transcription factor binding is not straightforward, accessible chromatin generally facilitates association of transcription factors to dna. some transcription factors, however, can modify the chromatin landscape around their binding site, which may recruit new transcription factors and chromatin-modifying factors to the region  <cit> . changes brought on by such events are the foundation for cell differentiation, whereby chromatin domains and transcription factor binding can be used as markers for cell type-specific regulation. recent advances in high-throughput sequencing coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation   <cit>  have enabled genomewide mapping of such domains. though several studies have used chip-seq to analyse large sets of transcription factors in different organisms  <cit>  or the interplay between sets of histone modifications  <cit> , few studies have investigated the relationship between large sets of transcription factors and histone modifications  <cit> . one reason for this is that such a data set would require considerable resources to produce. however, the joint efforts of researchers in the laboratories participating in the encode project  <cit>  are now making such studies possible in a few selected cell lines.

the goal of this study was twofold. first, we wanted to investigate whether genomic regions enriched with bound transcription factors can be used to improve the identification of regulatory elements in the human genome. specifically, we investigated whether such enriched regions concurred with existing genome annotations and data for histone modifications. furthermore, we used the enriched regions to identify chromatin markers that best correlated with the binding of transcription factors and to evaluate previously used markers for regulatory regions. second, we wanted to investigate whether the combination of transcription factors associated with the enriched regions differed depending on the type of regulatory element to which the enriched region mapped. specifically, we wondered whether the transcription factor composition differed between enhancers and tss proximal promoter elements.

our analysis was based on chip-seq reads for transcription factors from two cell lines: k <dig> and gm <dig>  totals of  <dig> and  <dig> factors, respectively, were mapped in each cell line, and  <dig> factors were mapped in both cell lines. we used clusters of colocalised transcription factor-binding events as identifiers for regulatory elements involving transcription factors and verified that these clusters generally overlapped with regions of active chromatin. we then used two different strategies to identify four groups of transcription factor clusters with potentially different regulatory roles. first, we examined clusters mapping to previously annotated genes and promoters and separated these into  clusters mapping to annotated promoter regions  and  clusters mapping to annotated genes but outside the promoter region . second, we performed an alternative cluster separation independent of annotations, where clusters mapping to histone modifications closely associated with active transcription  binding: transcript clusters) were separated from clusters with potentially distal regulatory function with respect to transcription . this definition represents an additional separation of the regulatory elements normally referred to as 'enhancers'  <cit>  into elements that produce transcripts and those that do not. the clusters associated with transcripts also correlated with actual transcription levels from high throughput rna sequencing  data. when comparing clusters in these groups, we observed that the clusters differed in their composition of transcription factors and association with specific histone modifications. especially, we found that the identified enhancer clusters correlated well with the histone modification h3k4me <dig>  a marker previously used for enhancers, but less well with acetylation of lysine  <dig> on histone  <dig>  or binding of the histone acetyltransferase p <dig>  two other commonly used markers for enhancers. we also investigated whether our selection of transcription factors gave good coverage of all cell type-specific regulatory elements in the human genome and found that a relatively modest selection of factors was sufficient to cover 90% of the annotated promoters for transcribed genes.

RESULTS
chip-seq peaks for different transcription factors cluster along the genome
binding sites for transcription factors tend to cluster in regulatory modules  <cit> , and recent studies in drosophila  <cit>  and mouse  <cit>  have also shown that peaks from a set of transcription factors identified by chip-seq and related methodologies tend to cluster along the genome. to investigate whether human transcription factor chip-seq peaks also display clustering properties, we identified overlaps between chip-seq peaks for  <dig> factors in k <dig> and for  <dig> factors in gm <dig> . these overlaps were compared with overlaps obtained by randomly shuffling peak positions within each chromosome. for the  <dig> factors in k <dig>  a total of  <dig>  individual chip-seq peaks were identified. when identifying overlaps, these peaks condensed into  <dig>  nonoverlapping regions, where  <dig>  regions contained more than one peak. the same procedure for the randomly shuffled peaks produced  <dig>  regions, where only  <dig>  contained more than one peak. we defined each region containing more than one peak as a transcription factor cluster, and this definition was used throughout the rest of this study. the relative number of real transcription factor clusters compared to random clusters strongly increased with the number of transcription factors mapping to the cluster . we also observed an increase in the average length of the random clusters compared to transcription factor clusters as more peaks associated with the cluster . the latter indicates that peaks within each cluster locate to more similar genomic positions than would be expected by chance. the results were similar for the  <dig> factors analysed in gm <dig> , where  <dig>  peaks produced  <dig>  nonoverlapping regions, and  <dig>  regions contained more than one peak. the corresponding numbers for the random shuffle were  <dig>  and  <dig> . on the basis of these results, we conclude that human chip-seq peaks from different transcription factors have a strong tendency to form clusters along the genome. we also calculated the overlap between transcription factor clusters in both cell types and found  <dig>  overlapping clusters . a comprehensive comparison between cell types will be the topic of a future study . herein we focus on the cluster patterns within each cell type individually but compare general trends between the cell lines.

histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> methylation is the chromatin mark best associated with transcription factor binding
presumably, transcription factors require open chromatin for dna binding, but it is unclear whether open chromatin by itself is a good predictor of transcription factor binding. to address this question, we investigated the overlap between transcription factor clusters and experimentally defined open chromatin regions   or regions containing different histone marks associated with open or closed chromatin. our first observation was the abundance of ocrs compared to regions showing mono-, di- or trimethylation of h3k <dig>  histone modificationstypically associated with accessible chromatin  <cit> . although the number of regions enriched with h3k4me comprised less than half the number of experimentally defined ocrs ,  <dig> of  <dig> transcription factor data sets had overlap with h3k4me similar to or better than that with ocrs . exceptions were the pair ctcf/rad <dig>  which mapped better to ocrs than to h3k4me, and a few other factors, such as nrsf and setdb <dig>  which mapped to neither h3k4me nor ocrs. when ctcf/rad <dig> was excluded, 90% and 92% of the clusters, respectively, mapped to h3k4me compared to 92% and 93% that mapped to ocrs for k <dig> and gm <dig>  respectively , despite the much smaller number of h3k4me regions. only a few clusters  mapped to regions without h3k4me, ocrs or h3k27ac and/or h3k9ac. we therefore conclude that h3k4me and ocrs mark somewhat different types of accessible chromatin most visible in the overlap with ctcf/rad <dig> elements, but that h3k4me is a more specific signature than ocrs for the binding of most other transcription factors.

different transcription factors showed a preference for different general chromatin signatures . factors enriched at annotated promoters  generally mapped to h3k4me <dig>  whereas other factors  preferentially mapped to h3k4me <dig>  which may indicate their association with enhancers. except for a few factors not mapping specifically to any chromatin mark, all factors analysed in this study preferentially mapped to known marks for accessible chromatin. this shows that regions enriched with transcription factors can generally be used as an alternative to histone modifications and other markers  to identify genomic regions involved in gene regulation. we also found that data for histone modifications associated with accessible chromatin were highly redundant. regions marked by acetylation  were almost totally contained within h3k4me , and regions marked by h3k <dig> mono-, di- and tri-methylation were also highly overlapping . in addition, h3k27ac and h3k9ac regions where highly overlapping in k <dig> , whereas in gm <dig>  h3k9ac regions  covered a subset of h3k27ac regions . though h3k27ac and h3k9ac correlated well with other marks for accessible chromatin, these regions showed a weaker overlap with clusters compared to h3k4me and ocrs . all of these observations taken together show that h3k4me is a good marker for accessible chromatin and seems to be the preferred marker for transcription factor binding.

few factors were associated with repressive modifications. an important exception is nrsf , which, in contrast to the other modifications we analysed, mainly associated with h3k27me <dig> . nrsf is a transcriptional repressor that acts as a scaffold for recruiting several chromatin-modifying complexes involved in dimethylation of h3k <dig>  and demethylation of h3k <dig>  <cit> . by binding long noncoding rnas, nrsf can also colocalise with polycomb-repressive complex  <dig>   <cit> , which may explain the observed association between nrsf and h3k27me <dig>  similarly, h3k27me <dig> was partly associated with ctcf/rad <dig>  which is consistent with ctcf's interacting with prc <dig>  <cit> .

transcription factor clusters map to promoters of transcribed genes and upstream and/or downstream of promoters of both transcribed and silent genes
the binding of transcription factors is closely related to gene transcription. to test whether transcription factor clusters associate with transcribed genes, we investigated the binding pattern of clusters within the set of annotated nonredundant genes  and their promoters  and correlated this with rna-seq gene transcription data . on the basis of rna-seq, we defined  <dig>  genes as being highly transcribed in both cell lines and identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes with zero transcription in k <dig> and gm <dig>  respectively. in accordance with previously reported results  <cit> , h3k4me was enriched around tsss for the set of transcribed genes, h3k36me <dig> and pol ii were enriched in their transcribed regions and h3k27me <dig> was enriched at silent genes .

in transcribed genes, clusters were highly abundant around tsss, as expected . however, we also observed clusters mapping outside the typical promoter region  <dig> kb upstream and  <dig> bp downstream from tsss. the overall number of clusters mapping to the immediate promoter region of transcribed genes  was comparable to the number of clusters mapping to other parts of the genes , in particular for k <dig> . for silent genes, the number of promoter clusters was greatly reduced compared to the number of gene clusters. thus gene clusters locate to both transcribed and silent genes, whereas promoter clusters mostly locate to transcribed genes. for both transcribed and silent genes, the distribution of clusters showed no clear distance dependence beyond  <dig> kb from tsss. this likely reflects promoter clusters' direct regulation of local rna polymerase recruitment or assembly, whereas gene clusters are involved in long-range regulation.

composition of gene clusters correlates with h3k4me and differs from promoter clusters of transcribed genes
to further investigate differences in function between promoter and gene clusters, we asked whether the groups differ in their use of transcription factors. furthermore, when correlating the locations of transcription factor clusters to histone modifications, we observed that the gene clusters could be further separated into two groups, depending on their association with h3k4me . we therefore used correlation coefficients  to measure the difference in transcription factor composition between promoter clusters, gene clusters overlapping with h3k4me and gene clusters not overlapping with h3k4me . specifically, we calculated correlation coefficients by comparing profiles of relative enrichment of transcription factors within each group of clusters .

prom, promoter clusters; gene-any, gene clusters; gene-pos, gene clusters overlapping with h3k4me; gene-neg, gene clusters not overlapping with h3k4me; h, genes with high expression; z, genes with zero expression.

consistent with the different regulatory functions of promoter and gene clusters in transcribed genes, these two cluster types showed the largest difference in composition  . we also observed a large compositional difference between gene clusters associated with and not associated with h3k4me  and between gene clusters associated with h3k4me and promoter clusters  in transcribed genes. thus transcribed genes had three types of clusters with markedly different composition: promoter clusters close to tsss, gene clusters more distal to tsss associated with h3k4me, and gene clusters far into the gene body not associated with h3k4me.

when comparing clusters between transcribed and silent genes, we observed that the composition of gene clusters did not change with respect to transcription  and that this was true both for gene clusters associated with h3k4me   and for those not associated with h3k4me . in contrast, and consistent with promoter clusters' having active and local roles in transcription regulation, promoter clusters changed in composition between transcribed and silent genes . thus there is a change in composition between transcribed and silent genes only for promoter clusters, whereas the composition in gene clusters remains similar. this indicates that long-range regulatory interactions are present in both transcribed and silent genes. further supporting this conclusion, ctcf, which facilitates long-range interactions  <cit> , was among the most abundant transcription factors in all regions except for promoters of transcribed genes .

for silent genes, the compositional differences between the three types of clusters showed some discrepancies between the two cell lines. especially for k <dig>  the composition of gene clusters associated with h3k4me mostly resembled the composition of promoter clusters , whereas the closest resemblance was observed with gene clusters not associated with h3k4me in gm <dig>  .

the enrichment of individual transcription factors in promoters and genes did not always reflect the composition of the different cluster groups. most factors were present in several groups, but the relative enrichment of each factor in each group was sometimes very different . for example, in transcribed genes, a higher number of promoter clusters contained the factor c-jun  compared to gene clusters , but the percentage of clusters containing c-jun was slightly higher in gene clusters  than in promoter clusters . thus c-jun may have a more important regulatory role in gene clusters, even though more chip-seq peaks for this factor mapped to promoter clusters than to gene clusters. generally, the  <dig>  c-jun peaks mapped better to tss distal markers, such as h3k4me <dig>  than to promoters, which indicates the involvement of c-jun in long-range regulatory interactions.

we also noted some h3k4me and pol ii enrichment at promoters of silent genes. however, this enrichment was not transformed into transcriptional output, as evidenced by the zero rna-seq expression and low enrichment of h3k36me <dig> for these genes . the increased enrichment of these transcript-related features may explain the higher concentration of transcription factor clusters around tsss for silent genes in k <dig> compared to gm <dig> .

h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig> and pol ii identify clusters overlapping with transcripts
in addition to annotated promoters and genes, we expected a proportion of the transcription factor clusters to associate with transcripts and enhancers outside annotated regions. to separate clusters located to promoters or to the body of transcripts  from clusters not associated with promoters or transcript bodies , we used associations with histone modifications h3k36me <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  together with enrichment of pol ii, as described by mikkelsen et al.  <cit> . because of the special regulatory function of ctcf/rad <dig>  these two factors were left out of the analysis at this stage. clusters overlapping with either h3k36me <dig> or pol ii were classified as transcript clusters. in addition, clusters overlapping with h3k4me <dig> were classified as transcript clusters if the region of h3k4me <dig> enrichment overlapped with either h3k36me <dig> or pol ii. the last criterion separated isolated regions of h3k4me <dig> from regions of h3k4me <dig> that involved the other two transcription markers. we used independent data for pol iii to identify additional transcript clusters not transcribed by pol ii.

three points must be mentioned with respect to the classification of transcript and enhancer clusters. first, we have used the term 'enhancer clusters' to describe clusters which do not contain the histone modifications and polymerase signatures characteristic of transcription and have indicated that these are more likely to be involved in long-range interactions. however, a recent study  <cit>  showed that a subset of enhancers involved in long-range interactions also produce short noncoding transcripts. since such enhancers also recruit pol ii and show enrichment of h3k36me <dig>  <cit> , these regulatory elements are classified among the transcript clusters according to the definition given above. second, a subset of enhancer clusters may represent elements that are not involved in direct gene regulation  <cit> . third, when we compared this data-driven classification with our previous annotation-based analysis, we observed some transcript clusters in promoters and gene bodies of silent genes, especially in k <dig>  the set of silent genes showed a small enrichment of pol ii and h3k4me <dig>  around their tsss , but this enrichment did not result in detectable transcription. we still chose to classify clusters in these silent gene regions as transcript clusters, as these signatures were most likely a result of stalled transcription  <cit>  and not related to long-range interactions. so, though there may be different and possibly overlapping functions between the two classes of regulatory elements, we continue to use the notion of transcript clusters as mainly transcript-producing and enhancer clusters as mainly involved in long-range interactions throughout the rest of the text.

in k <dig> and gm <dig>  we identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcript clusters, respectively, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  enhancer clusters, respectively. as expected, most of the transcript clusters and a minority of the enhancer clusters in k <dig> and gm <dig> mapped to annotated promoters and genes  . to validate these transcript clusters, we investigated their overlap with genes with respect to high, medium/low and zero gene expression as measured by rna-seq . over 95% of the transcript clusters in k <dig> and 99% in gm <dig> mapped to genes with high or medium/low expression. the enhancer clusters were more evenly distributed among the three expression states, with a slight bias towards genes with medium/low or zero expression. both results confirmed that the model based on h3k36me <dig>  h3k4me <dig> and pol ii could separate enhancer clusters from transcript clusters associated with annotated genes and promoters.

we primarily used pol ii-related transcription to separate transcript clusters from enhancer clusters. transcripts can be produced by polymerases other than pol ii, and clusters associating with these polymerases should be identified by our model as long as they also associate with h3k36me <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  however, we did not always observe this association when analysing independent data for pol iii. the overlap between pol iii and h3k36me <dig> was only 39% and 26%, compared to 72% and 71% for pol ii and h3k36me <dig>  in k <dig> and gm <dig>  respectively. we therefore included the independent pol iii data in our model. on the one hand, we do not know whether other polymerases behave similarly to pol ii or pol iii with respect to h3k36me <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  so we cannot exclude the possibility that some clusters classified as enhancer clusters may be associated with transcription by other polymerases, such as pol i. the effect of pol i transcription may, on the other hand, be most pronounced in genomic repeat regions, which are often excluded when mapping chip-seq data to the genome.

a large number of clusters mapped outside annotated genes and promoters  . to validate transcript clusters mapping outside annotated genes and promoters, we used data from two independent studies that identified promoters for mirna transcripts  <cit>  and long, intergenic, noncoding rna  transcripts  <cit> . the mirna tsss were cell type-independent, whereas the lincrnas were mapped in another cell line. we found an increased overlap between these noncoding rna transcripts and our transcript clusters compared to enhancer clusters and overlaps expected by chance . though the independent data covered only a small part of the transcript clusters outside annotated genes and promoters, the good correspondence between transcript clusters and data from rna-seq, mirna and lincrna lead us to conclude that the transcript clusters did represent transcript-related regulatory elements. conversely, we concluded that the enhancer clusters were enriched with long-range regulatory elements.

anumber of overlaps expected by chance are shown in parentheses.

h3k4me <dig> is a better marker for enhancer clusters than p <dig> or h3k27ac
though attempts have been made to annotate enhancers  <cit> , the general impression is that enhancers remain poorly annotated in the human genome. the most likely transcription factor clusters associated with enhancers are clusters that lack the histone modification marks characteristic of transcription . we therefore wondered whether these clusters, which we termed 'enhancer clusters', showed marks previously associated with enhancer regions. we focused our analysis on enhancer clusters mapping outside annotated genes and promoters. there were  <dig>  clusters of this type in k <dig> and  <dig>  in gm <dig>  we then investigated the overlap of these clusters with respect to three recently used marks for enhancers: histone modifications h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac and binding of the histone acetyltransferase p <dig> . several studies have suggested that h3k4me <dig> is an enhancer marker  <cit> , and we also observed an enrichment of h3k4me <dig> relative to other histone modifications within our enhancer clusters. our results thus confirm h3k4me <dig> as a good marker for enhancers in both cell lines.

another marker commonly used for enhancer identification is the transcription factor and histone acetyltransferase p <dig>  <cit> . however, we did not observe a good correspondence between this factor and enhancer clusters in gm <dig>  only 8% of the enhancer-related clusters were covered by this factor . in fact, we identified ten factors in gm <dig> with better coverage of the enhancer clusters than p <dig>  the best ones being batf , irf <dig>  and pu <dig> . the latter factors also showed a preference for h3k4me <dig> , whereas p <dig> also mapped well to h3k4me <dig> and transcript clusters.

although we saw poor correspondence between p <dig> and regulatory elements in gm <dig>  p <dig> could be a better marker in other cell lines  <cit> . only approximately  <dig>  p <dig> peaks were identified by the chip-seq analysis, which is one reason for the low coverage in gm <dig>  in addition, the identified peaks did not seem to map specifically to enhancers. we did not observe any transcription factors with specificity only towards the enhancer related clusters, and all factors with a high overlap with these clusters also overlapped well with transcript clusters .

h3k27ac has also recently been used as an identifier for enhancer regions  <cit> , but it showed a weaker overlap with enhancer clusters compared to h3k4me <dig> . in addition, all enhancer clusters containing h3k27ac also contained h3k4me <dig>  still, h3k27ac has been shown to be a useful marker for separating active from weak enhancers  <cit>  and might provide valuable information on subclasses of enhancers and enhancer activity in addition to the h3k4me <dig> mark. the notion that h3k27ac marks specifically active regulatory elements is reinforced by the observation that h3k27ac is present at nearly all active genes . we also observed that h3k9ac shows a mapping pattern similar to that of h3k27ac, especially in k <dig> . the percentage overlap of h3k27ac was also similar to that of h3k4me <dig> ; however, these two modifications mark somewhat different enhancer clusters. ocrs also showed good overlap with enhancer clusters, but an ocr in itself was a less specific marker for enhancer clusters because of the large number of ocrs not mapping to any transcription factors . thus the overall conclusion is that, in our enhancer clusters bound by transcription factors, h3k4me <dig> was a superior individual marker compared to h3k27ac, p <dig> and ocrs.

mapped transcription factors cover a high percentage of promoters in highly transcribed genes
there are  <dig>  to  <dig>  known transcription factors binding to dna in humans  <cit> . because not all factors are expressed in each cell type and since factors generally bind to dna in a combinatorial fashion, we investigated whether our selected clusters were sufficient to cover regulatory regions in a specific cell type. we investigated the ability to cover annotated promoters for genes with high, medium/low and zero expression in both cell lines . the coverage estimate was based on an average of  <dig> calculations whereby the order in which the transcription factors were selected was randomly shuffled between each calculation. as more transcription factors are added, the percentage of regulatory elements covered by clusters increases. for promoters of highly expressed genes, the coverage reaches 91% for k <dig> and 55% for gm <dig> when all transcription factors are added. the coverage was lower in promoters of genes with medium/low and zero expression, which is consistent with these genes' having low or no transcription in the two cell types. to investigate whether the inclusion of singletons would increase the coverage further, we repeated the analysis, but now also including singleton peaks in addition to clusters . when singletons were included, the coverage increased to 96% for k <dig> and 80% for gm <dig>  an interesting observation regarding k <dig> is that when the number of factors exceeds  <dig>  the increase in coverage of highly transcribed genes by adding a new factor is only marginal. this trend was also observed when we investigated coverage of the identified transcript and enhancer clusters by the same procedure . thus, despite the large number of existing human transcription factors, the results derived from the coverage analysis indicate that a relatively modest number of factors may be sufficient to map regulatory elements in a specific cell line.

discussion
observed cluster differences are not due to noisy chip-seq peaks
chip-seq data are potentially noisy  <cit> , so it was important to separate noisy peaks from true binding events in our study. given the clustering properties of transcription factors, we regarded overlapping peaks as more confident than singleton peaks, which led us to focus on peak clusters rather than individual peaks when defining regulatory transcription factor elements. we validated this approach  by sorting peaks for each of the  <dig> transcription factor data sets into  <dig> bins according to increasing chip-seq tag intensity so that the most intense peaks were associated with the highest bin number. the largest number of singleton peaks was found in bin  <dig>  whereas the largest number of peaks in clusters of size both  <dig> and  <dig> were found in bin  <dig>  this indicates that a higher fraction of the singleton peaks are potentially noisy and no gain in peak confidence is realised by increasing the cluster size limit from  <dig> to  <dig>  we thus decided to use a cluster size limit of  <dig> in our study. to further verify that peaks in genes clusters were not due to noise, we investigated the confidence of peaks in gene clusters versus promoter clusters. though we observed a higher average cluster size in promoter clusters than in gene clusters , only minor differences in the average bin value were observed, meaning that chip-seq peaks in gene clusters are not more likely to be noise than peaks in promoter clusters. the reason for the decreased average size of gene clusters could be that fewer factors in these clusters were mapped by chip-seq or that these clusters generally contain fewer transcription factors. we also investigated whether the difference in transcription factor composition among the cluster groups shown in table  <dig> changed when we increased the cluster size limit to  <dig> and  <dig>  though we generally observed an increase in the correlation values with increasing cluster size limit, the relative differences between the groups stayed the same .

not all singleton peaks are noise. in fact, some of the singleton peaks are among the high-confidence peaks within their data sets. however, by focusing on peak-overlaps, we could concentrate our analysis on regulatory regions containing several peaks, even if each peak in the region was less confident when evaluated on its own. we also considered the effect of losing a few singleton peaks and candidate regulatory regions preferable to including false-positive singleton peaks, which would lead to many additional false regulatory elements.

clusters and chromatin signatures show discrepancies between the two cell lines
when mapping transcription factor clusters to annotated genes, our results agreed with the common notion that transcription factors in promoter regions drive the recruitment of the transcription initiation complex leading to gene transcription. clusters were highly enriched within the typical promoter region  of the tsss in transcribed genes and depleted in silent genes. we also identified a significant number of clusters within genes, which, compared to promoter clusters, showed little change in abundance and composition between transcribed and silent genes. several studies have reported transcription factor binding outside the typical promoter region  <cit> , but the extent and biological significance of such binding events have generally been studied less often. some of the regulatory roles of transcription factors in these tss distal clusters could be to modulate the chromatin environment around genes, to work as enhancer elements directed towards their own gene or distant genes, or to regulate individual transcription of noncoding rna within the gene body. the correlation in composition between some of these clusters and h3k4me should indicate a role in chromatin modulation. the total number of gene clusters was higher in transcribed genes than in silent genes . studies of three-dimensional chromosome organisation inside the nucleus  <cit>  have revealed that accessible and closed chromatin tend to compartmentalise, with the consequence that transcribed genes associated with accessible chromatin have a higher probability of being spatially close to other transcribed genes than to silent genes associated with closed chromatin. a high degree of dynamic intra- and interchromosomal interactions are often observed in the accessible compartment, which may explain the higher frequency of gene clusters in transcribed genes than in silent genes. our observation that ctcf was one of the factors most enriched in gene clusters  may also point in this direction, since ctcf is involved in higher-order organisation and modulation of chromatin domains  <cit> .

the discrepancies observed when we compared cluster composition in the two cell lines may have several explanations. the difference in similarity between promoter clusters in transcribed and silent genes for the two cell lines  may partly be explained by the somewhat higher enrichment of pol ii at silent promoters in k <dig> . when we removed pol ii-associated promoter clusters from silent genes in k <dig>  the correlation dropped from  <dig>  to  <dig> , which is more similar to gm <dig>  it is thus likely that promoter clusters at silent genes in k <dig> are more enriched in factors directly involved in transcription, leading to the increased composition similarity with promoter clusters of transcribed genes. additional observations indicate that transcription factors mapped in k <dig> are generally more promoter-specific and directly related to transcription than the factors mapped in gm <dig>  first, the number of gene clusters relative to promoter clusters is higher in gm <dig> than in k <dig> . second, when we investigated the transcription factor composition differences between enhancer clusters and clusters mapping to annotated promoters in transcribed genes, we observed a larger difference for k <dig>  than for gm <dig> . third, the higher influence of singletons for gm <dig> in the coverage analysis also indicates that gm <dig> promoters are less mapped by transcription factors than promoters in k <dig>  the latter difference could also be reinforced by the smaller number of factors mapped in gm <dig>  compared to k <dig> .

more transcript clusters mapped to silent genes in k <dig>  compared to gm <dig> 
further examination of the  <dig> transcript clusters mapping to silent genes in k <dig> revealed that  <dig> clusters contained h3k36me <dig>  which may indicate transcriptional events not captured by rna-seq. another  <dig> clusters contained the silent histone modification h3k27me <dig> in addition to the active marks, which relates these clusters to bivalent domains  <cit> . in promoters of bivalent genes the transcriptional machinery, including pol ii, is recruited, but transcription elongation is stalled and no transcriptional output is produced. we could not find the exact cause for the association of the other  <dig> transcript clusters to silent genes. another source of the cell type-specific discrepancies is the selection of transcription factors mapped by chip-seq in each cell line. of the  <dig> factors mapped in k <dig> and the  <dig> mapped in gm <dig>  only  <dig> factors were common to both cell lines. the selected transcription factors can thus be biased towards specific types of clusters, leading to inconsistent results when the composition profiles are compared. we cannot rule out effects of possible cell type-specific regulation mechanisms, which have been observed in recent studies  <cit> .

many regions enriched with h3k4me and open chromatin regions are not mapped by any transcription factors
we generally observed that clusters associated with both h3k4me and ocrs. however, large parts of the genome are enriched with h3k4me and ocrs without being associated with clusters . h3k4me <dig>  for example, is enriched in about three times as many regions as those mapped by clusters, whereas the corresponding overrepresentation of ocrs regions is about six times. when singletons are included, the corresponding enrichment ratios are about  <dig> and  <dig>  for h3k4me <dig> and ocrs, respectively. if h3k4me <dig> is regarded as a good marker for enhancers, there is a discrepancy between the coverage of clusters observed at annotated promoters  compared to the cluster coverage of regions enriched with h3k4me <dig> . if the 90% and 70%  coverage of clusters observed in promoters of active genes is representative of the coverage of regulatory elements in general, one would expect the percentage of h3k4me <dig> regions containing transcription factors to be much larger than the observed 50%. one reason for this discrepancy could be that the mapping of enhancer-binding transcription factors is sparse compared to those binding to promoters, leading to less coverage of enhancers. another possible explanation is that histone signatures such as h3k4me <dig> may be involved in processes other than facilitating transcription factor binding. the larger excess of ocrs might be due to the specificity of the cutting enzyme in dnase hypersensitivity  <cit>  or faire-seq  <cit> , which also may cut chromatin in regions where transcription factors are not likely to bind. the large number of regions identified by ocrs, as well as the observation that several of these regions are not mapped by any transcription factors, increases the possibility that many ocrs are not functional regulatory elements. though regions containing h3k4me <dig> and ocrs are good candidates for enhancers, the additional binding of certain transcription factors to these regions are generally considered a reinforcement of its actual enhancer functionality  <cit> . in addition, several of the enhancer clusters mapped to none of the signatures of accessible chromatin . this observation indicates that not all of the enhancer-related clusters are associated with active gene regulation, but may be involved in other functions and associated with other chromatin marks not mapped in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we investigated transcription factor clusters and their relation to gene annotations and chromatin environments throughout the human genome. our results provide new insight into the relationship between transcription factor binding in regulatory regions and histone modification domains. specifically, we found that transcription factor clusters mapping to genes outside the core promoter showed similar composition in both transcribed and silent genes, but that the composition differed depending on the presence of h3k4me. h3k4me was also identified as the preferred mark for transcription factor binding in general and should thus be used as a priority marker for identifying transcription factor-binding events in as yet uncharacterised cell types. we also confirmed that the histone modifications h3k36me <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  together with pol ii, could be used to separate clusters involved in transcription from clusters more related to long-range interactions, although the functions of these two classes of clusters may overlap somewhat. for the latter clusters, h3k4me <dig> was identified as the preferred marker compared to h3k27ac, p <dig> and ocrs. the further integration of high-throughput sequencing data of new histone modifications, transcription factors and other regulatory features in different cell types will most certainly increase our knowledge of the complex relationships between transcription factors and histone modifications.
