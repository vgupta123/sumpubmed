BACKGROUND
the pyridine dinucleotide, nad+, synthesized from the pyridine mononucleotides nicotinic acid mononucleotide  or nicotinamide mononucleotide , is a unique cellular molecule that cycles between nad+ and nadh co-enzymatically and is cleaved to produce nicotinamide  and acetylated adpribose in protein lysine deacetylation by sirtuins  <cit> . typically, eukaryotic de novo biosynthetic pathways produce namn from tryptophan through quinolinic acid  and from the vitamin, nicotinic acid . eukaryotic salvage pathways produce nmn from nam and/or nicotinamide riboside   <cit> . the biosynthetic pathways for nad+ in saccharomyces cerevisiae are schematized in figure  <dig>  though most eukaryotic nad+ biosynthetic pathways were described long ago, we have only recently determined the gene and enzyme basis for the nr kinase pathway  <cit> , nr kinase-independent nr salvage  <cit> , specific nr transport  <cit> , specific utilization of nicotinic acid riboside   <cit> , and dephosphorylation of nmn and namn to nr and nar  <cit> .

several lines of reasoning indicate that the availability of salvageable vitamin precursors and the regulation of salvage enzymes are key determinants of sir <dig> function. first, the na salvage enzyme nicotinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase, npt <dig>  is required for the longevity benefit of calorie restriction   <cit> . second, the nam salvage enzyme nicotinamidase, pnc <dig>  is induced by cr and other stresses and its induction correlates with increased lifespan  <cit> . third, yeast cells grown without na or nr are fully viable but have a short replicative lifespan  <cit> . fourth, provision of nr extends lifespan in a manner that depends on nr salvage enzymes, nrk <dig>  urh <dig> and pnp <dig>  <cit> . however, there have been fundamental critiques of the body of work that has attributed the longevity benefit of cr to sir <dig>  in particular, lifespan extension independent of sir <dig> has been demonstrated and a sir2-independent target of nicotinamide has been proposed  <cit> . additionally, the only report that sir <dig> exhibits increased gene silencing activity upon cr  <cit>  appears to be artifactual  <cit> . though sir <dig> may not increase gene silencing upon cr, it appears that cr results in reduced ribosomal dna recombination via a mechanism involving reduced tor signaling  <cit>  and/or the association of sir <dig> with ribosomal genes at the inner nuclear membrane  <cit> .

several models have been developed to account for how nad+ metabolism might be regulated by cr in a manner that would increase sir <dig> localization and/or function. according to one model, cr lowers nam levels, thereby relieving sir <dig> inhibition  <cit> . a second model claims that cr lowers nadh levels, thereby relieving sir <dig> competitive inhibition  <cit> . our prior work indicates that increased net nad+ synthesis in the presence of salvageable vitamins accounts for increased sir <dig> function  <cit> , though we had not determined whether nad+ metabolites are altered by cr. moreover, our recent work indicates that isn <dig>  which encodes an imp, nmn and namn 5'-nucleotidase activity, is increased in expression by provision of glucose and nicotinic acid  <cit> . here, to dissect the basis for longer lifespan in vitamin-replete versus vitamin-free medium and to determine whether nad+ metabolism is altered by cr, we developed a liquid chromatrography mass spectrometry  method to analyze the yeast nad+ metabolome. the method, utilizing electrospray ionization  and selected reaction monitoring , is powerful and sensitive, providing detection of all metabolites, including the predicted metabolites, nar and nr. the data indicate that increased net nad+ synthesis in rich and vitamin-replete medium may explain increased lifespan with respect to vitamin-free medium. however, the data are largely inconsistent with levels or ratios of nad+, nam or nadh as mediators of the effect of glucose limitation on lifespan, suggesting that provision of vitamins and cr extend lifespan by different mechanisms. moreover, the levels of namn and nmn are sufficient to allow regulated expression of namn/nmn adenylyltransferases and namn/nmn 5' nucleotidases  <cit>  to push nad+ metabolism forward to naad and nad+ or backward to nar and nr.

RESULTS
identification of the core nad+ metabolome in extracts of ml cultures of yeast
recently, tsuchiya and co-workers reported an lc-ms method with partial coverage of the nad+ metabolome. levels of nad+, nmn, namn, adpribose and amp were reported in mouse erythrocytes. however, nadh, nadp, nadph, qa, nr, nar, na, nam, and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide  were undetected or below detection limits in the biological sample  <cit> . lu and co-workers detected nar and nr in yeast extracts by lc-ms but determined nad+ levels using a cycling assay  <cit> . here, the core nad+ metabolome was detected and quantified by lc-ms using 1% of the yeast cell number of the previous method. keys to the present method were hilic on an aminopropyl stationary phase at basic ph, positive ion mode srm detection of  <dig> compounds, and negative ion mode detection of qa. separation and fragmentation behaviors of the  <dig> compounds are shown in figure  <dig>  as shown in table  <dig>  the limits of quantification  for  <dig> metabolites were in a 20-fold range from  <dig>  pmol  to  <dig>  pmol . technical replication errors measured in relative standard deviation  were 10% or less for  <dig> of  <dig> compounds.

to determine whether metabolite standards are stable in extraction conditions, triplicate mixtures of authentic nad metabolite standards were placed into to  <dig>  ml of boiling buffered ethanol and maintained at 80°c for  <dig> minutes. for comparison, identical mixtures of nad metabolite standards were combined with  <dig>  ml cold buffered ethanol and were maintained on ice. both groups of samples were dried by speedvac and reconstituted in 80% methanol/20% water, and were then analyzed by lc-ms. for all metabolites, average decreases in metabolite peak area from exposure to boiling extraction solvent were determined to be 15% or less. the observed decreases were not found to be statistically significant for any compound except inosine, which showed a  <dig> % decrease . these data are shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

to validate the quantitative accuracy of the method, it was necessary to determine whether ionization suppression and other matrix effects might affect the validity of metabolite calibration curves in the presence of cellular extracts. to develop an extract nearly devoid of the metabolites in question, an isotopically labeled yeast extract was prepared by growing fleischmann's yeast on medium containing uniformly 13c-labeled glucose . the 13c yeast cultures were harvested at the same optical density as the unlabeled yeast cultures, and metabolites were extracted from 13c-labeled yeast using the boiling buffered ethanol procedure  <cit> . the extract was then spiked with  <dig> μm 12c authentic nad metabolite standards and analyzed using lc-ms/ms.

to assess ionization suppression, the peak areas for the 12c standards in the 13c yeast extract were compared to the peak areas for a pure 12c standard mixture. these data are shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  all but three of the compounds showed no to moderate  reduction in signal in the presence of 13c yeast extract. thus, for the majority of the components of the nad+ metabolome, the method is sufficiently free from ionization suppression to allow direct quantification of the components of the nad+ metabolome in biological extracts. the three compounds that showed a more severe reduction of signal in the 13c yeast extract were nad+ , ino , and na . for these compounds, determination of absolute concentrations of the metabolites in cell extracts is subject to larger errors, although relative quantification is still possible. more robust quantification could be achieved with isotopically labeled internal standards for those components of the nad+ metabolome prone to ionization suppression, or by inclusion of a global internal standard, such as an isotopically labeled extract, in all samples.

increased net nad+ biosynthesis in rich and vitamin-supplemented media
yeast cells are either grown in rich medium, containing yeast extract, or in synthetic medium, which contains salts, metals, specific amino acids and nucleobases, and a selection of vitamins  <cit> . because yeast nitrogen base was formulated to support the growth of every yeast species  <cit>  including candida glabrata, which has no de novo biosynthetic capacity  <cit> , synthetic yeast medium typically contains  <dig> μm na. na-free synthetic medium supports the growth of wild-type s. cerevisiae but the replicative lifespan on such medium is approximately half that of cells grown on sdc with na, sdc with nr or on ypd  <cit> . earlier, we reported that yeast cells grown on sdc with na have an intracellular nad+ concentration of ~ <dig> mm, which declines to about  <dig> mm as cells reach stationary phase, that yeast cells grown on vitamin-free sdc have an intracellular nad+ concentration of ~ <dig> mm, and that yeast cells grown on sdc with  <dig> μm nr in place of na have a stable intracellular nad+ concentration of ~ <dig> mm. to test whether the lc-ms method could detect two-fold differences in nad+ levels and to determine whether other metabolites are altered by medium components other than glucose, we subjected cells grown in ypd, sdc and sdc without na to extraction and metabolite analysis by lc-ms. as shown in table  <dig>  the availability of yeast extract and na clearly increases net nad+ synthesis by two-fold into the nad+ and nadh pools, consistent with the increased sir <dig> functions and replicative longevity of cells grown in such conditions  <cit> .

* indicates a significant difference when compared to cells grown in sdc. † indicates a significant difference when compared to cells grown in ypd. ‡ indicates a significant difference between cells grown in ypd  <dig>  and ypd  <dig> % glucose.

because prior investigations of the effect of na, nr and nar only examined accumulation of nad+  <cit> , it was interesting to examine how provision of na or yeast extract and peptone  might alter the nad+ metabolome as a whole. as shown in table  <dig>  nad+ metabolites fall into several categories with respect to provision of na and yeast extract. whereas nad+ and nadh increase approximately two-fold with either life-extending change in medium, nadp and nadph are little changed. in contrast, the intracellular levels of nr and nmn were increased 2- <dig> fold, namn 4- <dig> fold, and nam and nar increased >20-fold by both life-extending conditions. these data suggest that not only is net nad+ synthesis increased by medium components, but that nad+ anabolic and catabolic processes are quantitatively and/or qualitatively altered by provision of medium components.

in addition to nad+ metabolites, we measured three nucleosides  and three nucleoside monophosphates . each nucleoside was strikingly increased in rich medium, suggesting that these nucleosides are present in yeast extract. not surprisingly, the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates were also greatly increased by provision of rich medium. for unknown reasons, na increased the net synthesis of ump by more than two-fold.

glucose limitation only mildly alters levels of nad+ metabolites
in mouse liver, a one day fast has been reported to elevate nad+ levels  <cit> . similarly, cr has been reported to elevate nad+ levels in brain  <cit> . this could either be mediated by increased net nad+ biosynthesis in these tissues or by increased mobilization of tryptophan or vitamin precursors of nad+  <cit> . to test whether yeast cells have a cell-autonomous mechanism to alter nad+ levels, we grew wild-type yeast cells in sdc media differing in glucose concentration . extraction and lc-ms analysis of these samples revealed the apparent intracellular metabolite concentrations shown in table  <dig>  the results are rather striking for the constancy in metabolite levels as a function of glucose limitation. excluding na and naad, which were not consistently detected in yeast samples, and nadph, which was present at < <dig> μm in the ypd sample, no compound was increased or decreased two-fold by glucose limitation to both  <dig> % and  <dig> %.

nam, a sirtuin-inhibiting compound  <cit> , which is present in sdc and ypd samples at ~ <dig> μm and can be detected in sdc -na samples at 5% of this concentration, was not reduced by glucose limitation. nad+, which was increased by provision of na or rich medium , was moderately reduced by glucose limitation, also a life-extending condition. nadh, which was increased by provision of na and by rich medium, was reduced somewhat more than was nad+. with glucose limitation to  <dig> %, nadh was reduced  <dig> -fold. with glucose limitation to  <dig> %, nadh was reduced  <dig> -fold. in contrast, the apparent levels of nadph were increased two-fold and four-fold by glucose limitation to  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, though the absolute contribution of the nadph fraction of pyridine dinucleotides remained very small. such data suggest the possibility that an nadph-generating process may be positively regulated by cr, though the target or the significance of elevated nadph in replicative longevity is unknown.

levels and ratios of nad+ metabolites
the present study indicates that yeast cells increase net nad+ biosynthesis with additions of yeast extract and nad+ precursor vitamins to the medium. our previous work suggests that yeast cells relying on de novo nad+ biosynthesis have an intracellular nad+ concentration of ~ <dig> mm that satisfies vital requirements but provides little support for sir <dig> function. according to these data, intracellular nad+ concentrations above ~ <dig> mm are associated with longer replicative lifespan and cellular nad+ concentrations vary from ~ <dig> mm to ~ <dig> mm  <cit> . by lc-ms, the nad+ concentration is ~ <dig>  mm in vitamin-free medium and twice that when cells are grown with na. the lower nad+ concentrations in lc-ms measurements are likely a result of ion suppression.

with the caveat that ionization suppression reduced the observed levels of nad+ more than nadp, nadh and nadph, it is possible to use the nad+ metabolomic data collected herein to compare the ratios of the four major co-enzymatic forms of nad+ and determine whether such ratios are altered by medium components including na and glucose. as shown in table  <dig>  nadh as a proportion of nad+ is higher for cells grown in ypd than in the other conditions. consistent with a model of cr that glucose limitation would create a more oxidizing environment with a higher nad+:nadh ratio  <cit> , cells grown in  <dig> % glucose had a higher nad+:nadh ratio than cells grown in 2% glucose. however, because nadh is such a poor inhibitor of sir <dig>   <cit> , it is not clear how reducing nadh concentrations from ~ <dig>  mm to the  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm range would increase sir <dig> activity. similarly, it remains to be seen if the increased nadph as a proportion of nad+, which correlated with glucose limitation, is functionally related to the longevity-promoting effects of cr.

nam is a known product inhibitor of sirtuins  <cit>  and pnc <dig>  encoding nicotinamidase, is induced by cr conditions and required for the longevity benefit of cr  <cit> . thus, the proposed ability of cr to reduce cellular nam concentrations or increase the nad+:nam ratio has been an appealing model  <cit> . however, as shown in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  cr does not reduce nam concentrations. consistent with data obtained by 13c nmr  <cit> , nad+ is actually reduced by cr conditions. thus, as illustrated in table  <dig>  the ratio of nad+ to nam is uncorrelated with increased lifespan. vitamin-free synthetic medium, which provides the shortest lifespan, had the highest nad+:nam ratio and reduction of glucose from rich medium reduced the nad+:nam ratio further.

the levels of the pyridine mononucleotides namn and nmn as compared to the levels of the dinucleotides naad and nad+ are of interest in two respects. first, the human namn/nmn adenylyltransferases are differentially expressed and localized, suggesting that the adenylylation steps in nad+ synthesis may be points of regulation  <cit> . second, with our recent discovery of nr as a vitamin and both nr and nar as apparent yeast metabolites  <cit> , we considered that production of these two nucleosides might be controlled by 5' nucleotidase activities acting on nmn and namn and identified isn <dig> and sdt <dig> as multifunctional 5'-nucleotidases that are responsible for cellular generation of nr and nar  <cit> . for the adenylylation steps in nad+ biosynthesis to be regulated and for production of nr and nar from nmn and namn to be plausible, cells would have to have reasonable concentrations of the pyridine mononucleotides. though the namn/nmn adenylyltransferases are known to perform reversible reactions in vitro  <cit> , such reactions, which produce inorganic pyrophosphate, would be rendered irreversibly forward in the direction of dinucleotides if the pyrophosphate is always rapidly consumed to orthophosphate in vivo. though pyrophosphate consumption is dogma, actual measurements of pyrophosphate in budding yeast cells indicate that levels can range from 10- <dig> times higher that atp under various growth conditions  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  there was 7-21% as much nmn to nad+ under all conditions examined. thus, steady state levels of the substrates of namn/nmn adenylyltransferases were detected under all conditions measured. in contrast, naad, the product of namn adenylylation and the substrate of glutamine-dependent nad+ synthetase qns <dig>  <cit> , was below 1% of the level of nad+ under all conditions examined, suggesting that naad produced from the de novo or preiss-handler pathways is driven forward under kcat/km conditions for qns <dig>  <cit> .

only a few years ago, nmn and nr were not depicted on the metabolic schemes for how yeast cells make nad+  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  nmn is more abundant than namn under all conditions examined even though no condition investigated the provision of nr, such that all nad+ biosynthesis is proceeding through namn. moreover, just as the proportion of nmn to nad+ suggested that nmn adenylyltransferase is not running irreversibly forward, the proportion of nr and nar nucleosides to the corresponding nmn and namn nucleotides, shown in table 3d, suggests mechanisms by which the cell may maintain nucleoside pools. indeed, we have now identified isn <dig>  previously reported to be an imp-specific 5'-nucleotidase  <cit> , and sdt <dig>  previously reported to be a pyrimidine-specific 5'-nucleotidase  <cit> , as responsible for nr and nar production in vivo  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the five growth conditions in this study allow two longevity-promoting regimens to be compared metabolically. cells grown with yeast extract or nicotinic acid have a longer lifespan than cells grown in vitamin-free synthetic media  <cit>  and cells grown in reduced glucose have a longer lifespan than cells grown in 2% glucose  <cit> . eight metabolites  are statistically significantly higher in both sdc and ypd than in sdc -na. however, none of these metabolites are higher in both  <dig> % and  <dig> % glucose than in 2% glucose. five metabolites are lower in both cr conditions . strikingly, three of the compounds that rise with provision of vitamins  fall in cr conditions. these data suggest that provision of vitamins and cr alter nad+ metabolism in two different ways and that vitamins increase net nad+ synthesis in a manner that extends lifespan, whereas cr employs a different mechanism.

the early models of cr either invoked increased flux  <cit>  or simple regulation of a single key sir2-inhibitory metabolite  <cit> . though flux has not yet been investigated and the data are inconsistent with simple regulation of nad+, nadh or nam, it remains to be determined whether the nad+ metabolite profile is regulated in a complex manner by cr in a manner that determines sir <dig> biological activity or whether the metabolic effects of cr are largely mediated in a sir2-independent manner. models that depend on increased flux will almost certainly depend on increased expression of pnc <dig>  which is induced by cr  <cit> . such a phenomenon would seem to be required for nam salvage to keep up with increased sir <dig> activity under cr conditions. however, because nam levels are not reduced by cr, it is not obvious how nam clearance can be the driver of increased sir <dig> activity.

the nad+ metabolomic assay described in this study should be empowering for multiple lines of investigation. this study, in addition to corroborating the existence of nar and nr in cells grown without these precursors  <cit> , demonstrates that yeast cells maintain a substantial proportion of potential nad+ equivalents in two mononucleotide pools that can be driven forward to produce naad and nad+ or driven backward by dephosphorylation to produce nar and nr. such steps in nad+ metabolism are almost certainly regulated by novel mechanisms. indeed, the quantitative analysis of nar, nr and nmn levels in yeast cells supplemented by none of these precursors creates problems that will only be solved by characterization of new genes, enzymes and pathways. with knowledge of the gene set, ongoing studies are designed to determine the rates of flux of metabolites upon imposition of cr and the nature of the nuclear, mitochondrial and cytoplasmic nad+ metabolomes.
