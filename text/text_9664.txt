BACKGROUND
transcriptional analysis using microarray technology has provided key insights into the biologic processes involved in lymphocyte proliferation and activation  <cit> . while changes in alternative splicing has also recently been recognized to critically influence these processes  <cit> , it has been technically quite challenging to conduct these studies. a new generation of arrays with sufficient feature density to target every known and predicted exon in the human genome has been developed. these exon arrays have the potential to allow the examination of transcript changes combined with alternate exon usage in response to specific stimuli.

in addition to changes in design of the exon arrays compared to the previous generation 3' in vitro transcription  arrays  <cit> , significant differences in protocols for their use present challenges to laboratories interested in switching platforms. these include rna labeling methodologies  <cit> , detection calling  <cit> , quality control checks for labeling  <cit>  and cel file assessment  <cit> , and analytical methodologies  <cit> . we designed a small study to assess exon array implementation and develop best laboratory practices and expertise to facilitate adoption of this technology. this study examines t-cell responsiveness to stimulation with pharmacologic mimics of antigen-receptor signaling with the intent to examine mrna alternative splicing and transcript expression during proliferation. this model system was selected because methods for activating or differentiating lymphocytes are well understood and the cells can be readily cultured. most importantly perhaps, comprehensive gene expression profiles have been published allowing cross platform comparisons  <cit> .

methods
subjects
blood samples were obtained from  <dig> healthy caucasian female volunteers, age 46- <dig> years. allergies and hay fever were excluded by self-report. informed consent was obtained from all subjects, and human experimentation guidelines of the us department of health and human services were followed in the conduct of this research.

primary cell isolation and stimulation
whole blood was collected from each donor in  <dig> cell preparation tubes  and the peripheral blood mononuclear cells  purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. lymphocytes for each donor were pooled, counted, assessed for viability with trypan blue , frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen.

just prior to use the pbmcs from each donor were fast thawed at 37°c and seeded into  <dig> t <dig> flasks  at  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells in  <dig>  ml roswell parks memorial institute  <dig>  medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. a t <dig> flask was harvested and assessed at day  <dig> . cells in all other flasks were stimulated by the addition of phytohemagglutinin , interleukin- <dig>  and ionomycin . flasks, one from each donor, were harvested and assayed on d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  cell counts were performed using trypan blue and samples were split for the individual assays. flow cytometric analyses were done at the time of harvesting, and the  <dig> ×  <dig> cells were pelleted, resuspended in  <dig> ml trizol reagent  and frozen for microarray analysis.

flow cytometric analysis
immunophenotyping was performed at each time point on  <dig> ×  <dig> cells to determine the t-cell , b-cell  and nk cell  subsets. the assay also included activation markers cd69-allophycocyanin  and cd25-apc. briefly, samples were incubated with appropriate concentrations of monoclonal antibodies  for  <dig> minutes at room temperature in the dark. cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for  <dig> minutes at 37°c and stored at 4°c until flow cytometric analysis. a second tube of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells was stained for the tunel assay using the apo-brdu kit  as recommended by the manufacturer. after assay completion, hoechst  <dig> was added for cell cycle determination and immediately processed on the flow cytometer. typically  <dig>  events were collected. data was acquired using cellquest software  . compensation for the assays and all data analysis was performed using flowjo software  .

microarray procedures
total rna was extracted from the pbmcs in trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions and quality and quantity was assessed using the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer. one μg was labeled using the exon wt sense target labeling assay  including the labeling controls from the genechip® eukaryotic poly-a rna control kit. each step of the labeling protocol was monitored using either the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer or the nanodrop spectrophotometer, as specified by affymetrix  <cit> . quality control  criteria included: 1) after the first cycle crna cleanup yields > <dig> μg as measured by nanodrop; 2) after the second cycle single-strand cdna cleanup, yields > <dig>  μg. both checkpoints need od260/ <dig> ratios of  <dig>  -  <dig> ; 3) required the fragmented antisense biotin-labeled cdna to peak at 40- <dig> bases when run on the bioanalyzer. hybridization buffer, eukaryotic hybridization controls , and oligob <dig> controls  were added to the cdna fragments just prior to hybridization to the affymetrix® human exon  <dig>  st array. hybridization was at 45°c for  <dig> hours  <cit> . following hybridization, the chips were washed and stained with a phycoerythrin-strepavidin conjugate using the genechip® fluidics station with the fs450- <dig> protocol. the chips were scanned using the affymetrix® genechip® scanner  <dig> and the affymetrix® genechip® operating software was utilized for the management, sharing and initial processing of the expression data. all data from the  <dig> exon arrays has been deposited in array express under accession number e-mexp- <dig> 

array quality control was performed using affymetrix® expression console™  at the transcript level using core-level probe sets. all image plots passed visual inspection. hybridization controls had all present with signal increases following concentration. labeling control signal strengths followed the order lys < phe < thr < dap. signal histograms and box plots were examined for raw and processed data. these provided a meaningful way to identify arrays with divergent probe intensity distributions relative to other arrays in the study. the  <dig> summarization metrics relative log expression , positive vs. negative roc auc and mad-residual mean were all within the parameters suggested by affymetrix  <cit> .

data preparation and analysis
data was pre-processed using partek genomic suite software  partek inc., st. louis, mo) with the core meta-probe set. the configuration consisted of a pre-background adjustment for gc content and probe sequence, robust multi-array analysis  <cit>  for background correction, quantile normalization and probe set summarization using median polishing. all signals were log <dig> transformed. library files were those specified by affymetrix  and the annotation file version was na <dig> hg <dig> 

the data analysis workflow for exon arrays is two pronged  <cit> . for determination of differential expression, probe set information is summarized into gene level information, and the analytical methodologies remain unchanged from those used for 3' ivt array data. differential expression was calculated using a repeated measure anova with time as the main effect. the multiple test correction implemented the q-value method  <cit>  to determine a false discovery rate  <  <dig> .

a second analysis looks at exon level data. in order to obtain meaningful alternate exon usage information, and to decrease the chance of false positives, several filtering steps were included prior to analysis  <cit> . the presence of absence of exon expression was determined using detection above background . all probe sets where the dabg p-value <  <dig>  were removed from the analysis. all genes represented by fewer than  <dig> probe sets in the transcript cluster were removed as it is often difficult to interpret alternative exon incorporation patterns with so few markers. similar reasoning was used to remove genes represented by > <dig> probe sets. all transcript clusters with high differential exonic expression  between groups were removed, as they have a tendency to produce false positive results for alternative splicing  <cit> . data were analyzed for alternative splicing by a repeated measure anova with time × probe set as the main effect and corresponding interaction. pair-wise analyses between d <dig> and the other time points were also performed. it is not clear how best to correct for multiple testing for the alternative-splicing analysis, however, the optimal cutoff value is dependent on the number of targets you wish to see in your final list. the q-value method was used to control the fdr with a cutoff < <dig>  to determine the presence of alternative exon usage. several investigators have previously suggested that manual review of the gene plots is required to identify forms of alternative splicing and determine the frequency of changes observed in the dataset  <cit> . criteria used for assessment were the same as those described previously  <cit> .

biological interpretation
gene enrichment analysis was used to interpret the biological impact of alternative exon usage and differential expression during lymphocyte proliferation. gene ontology  enrichment analysis was undertaken in partek genomic suite using a chi-square test comparing the proportion of the transcript list in an ontology, to the proportion of the background list in that same ontology. functional groups with > <dig> genes and an enrichment score >  <dig> were considered significant.

exon array validation by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
exon array findings  were validated using qpcr on the seven genes focused on in this study . validation of alternate exon usage was performed using  <dig> different primer-probe combinations within the same transcript. one pair to an area that showed isoform variation , and a second to an area which showed none  primer-probe set). the latter was used as an endogenous normalizer. for transcript expression validation β-actin was the normalizer gene with the c primer-probe set for the transcript of interest. β-actin expression did not vary significantly across the samples, allowing it to be used as the normalizer. primer express software  was used for the primer-probe design with transcript sequences from the netaffx website. probes were 5' labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein  and 3' labeled with mgb  non-fluorescent quencher. information on primers and probe sets used are in additional file  <dig>  pcr amplification efficiencies  were determined using a 5-step  <dig> fold dilution standard curve  and pbmc total rna. initial optimization experiments showed all pcr products were single bands by agarose gel electrophoresis and calibration curves ) had rsq values  >  <dig>  for all primer pairs. based on the slopes of the standard curves, the amplification efficiencies ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .

one microgram of rna was reverse transcribed into cdna using random hexamers. the  <dig> μl qpcr reaction contained  <dig> × probemaster pcr master mix ,  <dig>  μmol/l of each primer, and  <dig> μl template. the cycling conditions consisted of one cycle at 95°c for  <dig> min followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c ×  <dig> s, and 60°c ×  <dig> s, on the lightcycler®  <dig> system . all samples, including standards and non-template control were run in triplicate. the lightcycler®  <dig> software  was used for data analysis. for comparative quantification the ∆∆ct method was applied  <cit>  as it is suitable for a quick estimation of the relative expression ratio. this model presumes optimal and identical amplification efficiencies of target and reference genes.

RESULTS
exon labeling and microarray quality control assessment
the total rna extracted from pbmcs had rins >  <dig>  and  <dig> μg was used for rrna reduction. the percentage reduction ranged from 53-78%, with d <dig> unstimulated specimens showing an average reduction of 56%, d <dig> 69%, d <dig> and d <dig> 67%, and d <dig> 61%. the averaged % present calls on the array data were  <dig>   <dig>  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively. quality control check-points outlined in the methodology were easily met. the average yield for the crna step ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg and the cdna from  <dig>  to <dig>  μg. in both cases the lesser quantities were for d <dig> specimens. all yields were double that required for the next step, and od260/ <dig> ratios were around  <dig>  after fragmentation the peak size was consistently between  <dig> and  <dig> bases. the array qc metrics met all those specified in the affymetrix reference card  <cit> .

data filtration
for the expression data all probe sets with a log <dig> signal <  <dig> were removed, leaving  <dig>  probe sets which summarized to  <dig>  transcript clusters. for the alternate exon usage analysis, several layers of filtration were used to reduce the number of tests and increase the detection of alternative splicing events  <cit> . after filtration the data set covered around  <dig>  transcripts.

lymphocyte stimulation
stimulation resulted in reduced b- and nk-cell populations, with marked increases in the number of t-cells . t-cells represent >85% of the cell populations from d <dig> onward. up-regulation of cell surface markers cd <dig> and cd <dig> reflect the early and late activation of lymphocyte populations respectively . activation was first noted by d <dig> reaching a peak on d <dig> for nk-, t-, and b-cells, each population showing activation in 70-80% of the population. total cell numbers decreased from d <dig> to about 40% for d <dig> and d <dig>  and then increased on d <dig> and d <dig> to 140% of baseline. stimulated cell viability remained around 90% throughout the time series.

flow cytometric analysis showed the cell cycle position  and apoptotic status  of the lymphocyte population across the proliferation assay. a major shift into the s phase was seen by d <dig>  with a small proportion of lymphocytes being at g2/m, all returning to g0/g <dig> by d <dig> . these assays provide good markers for interpreting the differential expression and alternate exon usage data derived from the exon arrays. we are able to overlay biological changes measured by different platforms relating to cell cycle, validating what is being measured by the exon array platform.

exon analysis: alternate exon usage
both alternative exon usage and transcript expression profiling were assessed over the  <dig> days of lymphocyte stimulation. the splice-variant anova exploring alternate exon usage changes over time identified  <dig> transcript clusters with alternate exon usage after multiple test correction . visual inspection  <cit>  recognized  <dig> transcript clusters as likely candidates. pair-wise analyses comparing each day to the baseline unstimulated cells  identified  <dig> unique transcript clusters with alternate exon usage after visual inspection. venn diagrams show the distribution and overlap of these transcript clusters 

the  <dig> transcript clusters showing alternate exon usage within  <dig> hours of stimulation  were statistically enriched for regulation of signal transduction . ten are involved in gtpase mediated signal transduction , which involves both ras and rho subfamilies. activation of these signaling pathways results in cell growth, differentiation and survival, which are reflected in the d <dig> enrichment analysis by ontologies for cell differentiation  and cell death . half of the transcripts enriched in the cell death ontology are involved in its negative regulation. other alternate exon usage changes evident at d <dig> are two metabolism related categories: eicosanoid  and rna metabolism . d <dig> alternate exon usage enrichment analysis show rna metabolism, leukocyte differentiation, and cell death ontologies. however, few transcripts in each category overlap with d <dig> indicating the dynamics of alternate exon usage are changing. for example, d <dig> has  <dig> transcripts associated with rna splicing and d <dig>   <dig>  four are shared between the days . d <dig> shows enrichment in signal transduction terms, dominated by t-cell receptor signaling  and protein kinase cascade . the later continues through d <dig>  newly enriched categories by d <dig> include nuclear transport , positive regulation of transcription  and dna repair . the latter extends to the d <dig>  and d <dig>  analyses. three transcripts are common to dna repair over this time, whereas  <dig> are unique to d <dig>   <dig> to d <dig> and  <dig> transcripts to d <dig> .

approximately 50% of transcripts showing alternate exon usage across the time series are associated with cellular metabolism.

exon analysis: transcript expression
a parallel analysis identified  <dig> unique transcript clusters as differentially expressed  during the seven days of lymphocyte stimulation compared to d <dig>  of these, only  <dig>  also showed alternate exon usage.

functional comparison of alternate exon usage and differentially expressed transcript lists
enrichment analysis of the statistically significant transcript lists compared to those on the array was performed. examination of "cellular process" in the go biological process hierarchy  allowed us to focus on changes in cell cycle and apoptosis, enabling comparison to the flow cytometric data. differentially expressed transcripts show a much broader functional role compared to those having alternate exon usage. they are enriched in cell cycle, cell division, cell proliferation, chromosome segregation, cell death, component organization and biogenesis and metabolic process ontologies . the enrichment of the alternate exon usage transcript lists only shares the last  <dig> ontologies.

gene ontology  enrichment analysis of transcript lists was undertaken in partek genomic suite. results are presented for cellular process category under the go biological process. groups are presented with an enrichment score >  <dig> and >  <dig> genes per group.

aeu: alternate exon usage

de: differential expression

alternate exon usage in transcripts involved in nuclear mrna splicing via the spliceosome
for the transcripts showing alternate exon usage, rna processing was a dominant ontology, with nuclear mrna splicing via the spliceosome being an enriched sub-category. this go contains  <dig> transcripts, of which  <dig> showed alternate exon usage . the  <dig> last transcripts also had statistically significant differential expression , and a further  <dig> transcripts showing differential expression only were identified in this ontology.

several arginine/serine rich splicing factors show different alternative exon usage profiles after lymphocyte stimulation. sfrs <dig> has four mid-transcript probe sets with significantly higher exon expression on d <dig>  indicating an increase of the retained intron in unstimulated lymphocytes. sfrs <dig> shows a mix of mrna isoforms across the time series  with a cassette exon being highly expressed in unstimulated lymphocytes and decreased inclusion after stimulation. all other core-meta probe sets have similar expression levels on all days. visualization with the full meta-probe set  indicates  <dig> areas in sfrs <dig> with intron retention not described in the ucsc data base . sfrs <dig> shows statistical significant differences in the exon expression of probe set  <dig> on d <dig> and d <dig> relative to d <dig> . this is confirmed by similar expression patterns for the  <dig> adjacent probe sets included from the full meta-probe set. expression levels for the  <dig> remaining probe sets are the same for all days .

snrpb  shows major differences in exon expression after stimulation in  <dig> probe sets at the 3' end of the transcript . this covers an overlapping or "bleeding" exon described in the ucsc altevent track descriptor  <cit> .

rbm <dig>  is represented by  <dig> core meta-probe sets focused on the smallest mrna isoform . exon expression levels are statistically significant for  <dig> probe sets of the 3' cassette exon between d <dig> and d <dig>  the full meta-probe set adds  <dig> probe sets belonging to  <dig> long isoforms. signal for intronic sequence probe sets  indicates intron inclusion, which decreases during cell cycle progression .

u2af <dig>  shows different exon expression patterns at each end of the transcript. the  <dig> probe sets of the 5' exon show no differential expression, but all probe sets thereafter show differential expression . no expression is noted from probe sets to intronic regions.

rt-pcr validation of differential transcript expression and transcript alternate exon usage
validation was performed on  <dig> of the  <dig> transcript clusters discussed above. ddx <dig> was not included because of difficulties with primer/probe design. two levels of validation were attempted. the first examined transcript expression across the time series, normalizing expression values to an external gene β-actin. six of seven genes were validated, with the microarray results being concordant to the qpcr data in terms of direction of fold changes . alternate exon usage was validated using an internal transcript area with no differential expression as the normalizer gene. results reflect the same abundance changes in the area of alternate exon usage  as was evident on the exon arrays . five of seven events validated . cross-validation with existing information on alternate exon usage is also extremely useful. we have overlaid the ucsc genome browser altevent track onto the relevant gene views . this shows various types of alternative splicing, including alternative promoter usage, cassette exons etc. that result in more than a single transcript. many of these were concordant with our findings but several events appear to be newly described.

discussion
the affymetrix exon arrays offer a significant increase in content and a greater utility than their 3' expression arrays. the distribution of probes sets across each exon for some  <dig>  genes allows the mapping of splice variants. they feature a new design with no mismatch probes, and a random primed protocol to generate sense dna targets along the entire length of the transcript. these changes raised uncertainty with regard array performance, but transcript expression has been shown comparable with the 3' platforms with close agreement and similar sensitivity  <cit> . the minimal price difference between the platforms makes the exon array an attractive alternative. this pilot study was designed to determine the practicality of implementing these arrays in our laboratory.

every component of the exon array methodology, from reagents and protocols to quality control and analysis software is different for the exon arrays compared to the previous 3' arrays. both labeling methodologies take approximately  <dig> 1/ <dig> days with  <dig> overnight steps  however, the exon protocol has more steps and requires considerably more hands-on time , especially on the second day. a ribosomal rna reduction step is required prior to rna labeling to reduce their impact on amplification and labeling because of the random prime labeling strategy. this necessitates the purchase of special equipment for the magnetic bead separation. a scanner autoloader is also required as scan times increased from  <dig> to  <dig> minutes per genechip with the change in platform. in our laboratory we were able to do manual labeling of  <dig> samples per run, whereas for the 3' arrays we could do  <dig>  the downstream processing of data is also a challenge. data sets are much larger and the analysis is performed at several different levels: exon  or transcript  using either the core, full or extended probe sets  <cit> .

the quality control checks for monitoring the labeling protocol and the hybridized genechip were extremely useful. the former could save running poor samples on an array, allowing the labeling to be repeated. the latter prevented the inclusion of technical outliers in the statistical analysis. all our samples easily met the qc criteria. the only disparate data were differences in % rrna reduction. d <dig> samples had the lowest average reduction , peaking on d <dig>  and returning to baseline with d <dig> and d <dig> at 67%, and d <dig> at 61%. these differences were most likely due to increased protein synthetic levels expected for cell proliferation.

the corroboration of both transcript expression and alternate exon usage data using a different analytical platform adds weight to the value of exon arrays as an analytical tool. our validation rates by real-time pcr were 86% for expression data, and 71% for alternate exon usage results. validation rates for alternate exon usage in other studies using affymetrix exon arrays range from  <dig> to 84%  <cit> , some of the fluctuation can probably be attributed to differences in data filtration and no visual inspection of the results, emphasizing the importance of best practice methodologies. the alternate exon usage in many of the transcript clusters identified in this study showed greater complexity than a single exon inclusion or exclusion event, illustrating that more than one alternative splice isoform can be maintained concurrently in the mrna pool. for this data set, it is not possible to dissect if this reflects changes in the ratios of isoforms associated with physiological variation or reflect changes in the cell sub-populations. it is estimated that more than 75% of genes produce alternative transcripts  <cit> , contributing to functional diversity in the genome. therefore there is little question that this is an important component of understanding the complexity of the mammalian transcriptome.

implementation of the affymetrix exon arrays requires a considerable input of time but our results show that the benefits are worth the effort. probably the most challenging area currently, is the downstream analysis of data, mainly because of the increased data set size.

much work has been done to characterize the genome-wide transcriptional program of lymphocyte activation and proliferation in a wide range of systems, including cell culture  <cit>  whole blood  <cit> , pbmcs  <cit>  and purified cell populations  <cit> . this is a critical step toward understanding the biologic processes involved. the interpretation of expression patterns from mixed cell populations is complicated by variation in relative proportions of the cell subsets. we cannot distinguish between genes that undergo modest changes in a large percentage of cells from those that undergo large changes in a small subpopulation of cells. however, the strength of using mixed cell populations is in considering the interactions of these populations. regulatory functions may be provided by direct cell-to-cell contact or via cytokine secretion from different cells. to understand the regulatory networks underpinning cellular dynamics both purified and mixed-cell populations need to be studied. the same confounders apply to exon array profiling along with the possible differential compartmentalization of nuclear and cytoplasmic isoforms  <cit> .

the majority of transcripts that showed differential expression over time did not show a change in alternate exon usage , indicating that distinct networks of regulation are operating. interestingly, transcripts involving constitutive and alternative splicing regulators  were significantly enriched for alternate exon usage indicating auto-regulatory organization at the level of transcript splicing. while most of the alternate exon usage events in this study have previously been described, several new splicing patterns were identified, another benefit to implementing the exon array platform.

CONCLUSIONS
the ability to assess the functional state of lymphocytes is important as it relates directly to the ability of people to mount an effective immune response. differences in transcript abundance are routinely used as indicators of cell activity, and this study shows that both transcript quantity and isoform diversity contribute to the expression complexity of cells. strategies examining multiple forms of transcript expression changes are likely to provide a broader definition of cell behavior than are studies aimed at singular expression responses. we have demonstrated the utility of the affymetrix exon arrays and we believe their implementation, in place of expression only platforms, will alter the way we interpret microarray data. as an example, in this study we see different exon usage patterns in several proteins that play a substantial role in regulating alternative splicing by modulating spliceosome assembly and splice site choice  <cit>  after lymphocyte stimulation. this indicates that alternative exon usage plays an important role in lymphocyte proliferation. these results highlight the need for a more rounded view of expression analysis, and show that an extra level of molecular diversity can be added to studies with only a minor increase in cost.
