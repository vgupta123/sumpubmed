BACKGROUND
every year, potential crop yields are lost as a result of exposure to devastating conditions from extreme temperature to bacterial pathogens  <cit> . given the ever-increasing demand for food, prevention of losses from abiotic and biotic stresses offers a resource neutral avenue in terms of resource input to increasing food production. rice is a cereal crop species that is a significant part of the staple diet for half of the world’s population and is grown on every continent apart from antarctica  <cit> . considering this vast area of growth, rice is constantly exposed to interaction with various organisms from insects to bacteria. the ability to maintain or increase rice production in a cost effect manner will rely on developing varieties that can be productive in response to a variety of abiotic or biotic stresses. the use of biotechnological approaches to develop crops resistant to a given stress imposition often takes a single gene approach  <cit> , where stress induced genes encoding proteins, often transcription factors, are over-expressed in transgenic plants, resulting in greater tolerance to a given stress imposition. while this is promising there are several barriers translating laboratory based experiments to field situations, including the use of model plants compared to crop plants and the impositions of single stresses compared to multiple stresses  <cit> .

as rice is both a model and crop plant, it offers a system to directly determine the effect of stress on growth and yield in specific field varieties, even if under laboratory conditions. bacterial leaf blight is a common problem seen in rice species infected with xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae  and these infections are known to result in significant crop loss, ranging up to 60% of potential yield, or several billions in direct economic terms  <cit> . given that different cultivars of rice have been observed as having different levels of resistance to infections, understanding how this is possible and the mechanisms behind resistance is important for the prevention of this problem, and provides a good reference point to determine overlap in responses to other biotic and abiotic stresses. a significant number of studies examining bacterial infection in rice has led to the identification of more than  <dig> resistance  genes in rice, which are largely annotated by the prefix xa,  <cit> . given that plant immunity is based on the recognition and constant surveillance of pathogens through the pathogen recognition receptors  and nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat  type proteins , the r genes have been observed to largely encode these defence signalling functions  <cit> . however, in addition to recognition and signalling functions being crucial to resistance, a number of wrky transcription factors have also been observed to result in greater resistance when over-expressed/knocked-out, indicating that these have an important role in the regulation of gene expression following pathogen infection  <cit> . one example of this is for wrky <dig>  which has been found to be an important regulator of rice interaction with xoo as well as the fungus, m.grisea, where activation of this gene resulted in increased resistance of rice to these infections  <cit> . given the crucial role of transcription factors that have been shown to have a direct effect on resistance, as well as the findings that transcriptomic changes are characteristic of responses to infection  <cit> , the examination of global transcriptomic responses provide great insight into the mode of response to infection.

recent studies have examined the significant transcriptomic responses seen after rice infection with parasites , fungus , virus ;  <cit> ) and bacteria ;  <cit> ). in each of these studies, significant changes were seen to occur in the rice transcriptome in response to infection, with a number of genes encoding pathogenesis-related functions seen to be differentially expressed  <cit> . following parasite infection, significant differences in the transcriptome were observed between two different cultivars of rice, one of which is known to be resistant to s. hermonthica  and one known to be susceptible   <cit> . thus, while there are a number of studies examining the response of rice to individual biotic and abiotic stresses, this is little or no analyses of the comparative nature of the responses in terms of common, distinct or antagonistic in nature.

in this study the transcriptomic response to infection with the bacterium xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae  provides insight into the immediate changes that occur following infection, revealing that specific cell wall functions show a rapid down-regulation in response to infection in the resistant cultivar, while translation and stress-related functions were up-regulated. furthermore, the collation and comparison of the expression responses across various other abiotic stress transcriptomic studies  and biotic stress transcriptomic studies, enabled the identification unique gene-sets that are responsive to bacterial infection only  and a conserved response to all biotic stresses only . in this study we examine global transcriptomic responses to a variety of biotic  stresses in parallel, revealing the specific pathways e.g. calcium signalling and wrky and nac transcription factors that have a conserved response across multiple pathogen infections in rice. together, these analyses enabled a model for the rice biotic stress response to be generated, showing all the pathways that are conserved in response to combinations of different pathogen infections, revealing the core pathogen response, which could not have been identified without these multiple comparisons. the functional role for several genes identified by the analyses in this study e.g. the specific wrky and nac transcription factors, calcium signalling proteins and metal transporters have, in recent years, been shown to have a functional role in the relevant biotic  stress response, supporting their identification by the analyses in this study, and their crucial role in the plant defence response  <cit> . thus, the results presented here are not only validated by a number of these studies, that have altered the expression of single genes and observed resistance to biotic stresses  <cit> , but also presents novel candidate genes that may also function in multiple biotic stress resistance.

RESULTS
confirming infection by xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae 
it has been shown that the rice cultivar ir <dig> is susceptible to infection with almost all xoo strains  <cit> , where infection is seen to result in significant leaf damage. in contrast, the isogenic line irbb <dig> is known to be resistant to xoo infection as it carries the resistance gene xa <dig> <cit> . to gain insight into the early transcriptomic responses to xoo infection in these two contrasting cultivars, leaves were sampled at  <dig> and  <dig> hours post infection . it is evidenced however, that although transcriptomic responses were occurring at these times, no visible differences in leaves were seen both at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi . however, continued examination of the infected leaves reveals that by  <dig> weeks after infection, significant changes in colour and cellular morphology are evidenced . specifically, it can be seen that in the susceptible ir <dig> cultivar, greater than half of the leaf has lost colour and viability, in contrast to the mock treated ir <dig> and resistant irbb <dig> cultivar . notably, although some disease symptoms were seen in the resistant cultivar , it was considerably less than the damage seen in the susceptible  cultivar . therefore, the transcriptomic responses at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi represents the earliest responses to infection, occurring at the molecular level, well before any significant morphological changes can be observed.

differential response to xoo infection in resistant and susceptible rice cultivars
analysis of the transcriptomic response to infection with xoo revealed that  <dig> genes were significantly  up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated in the resistant cultivar, whilst susceptible infection resulted in less than a quarter of that number . it has been suggested that susceptible response to infection is comparable to an early resistant response  <cit> , which is supported by the finding that the number of genes differentially expressed at  <dig> hpi, in the susceptible cultivar is more comparable to the number seen at  <dig> hpi in the resistant cultivar . it is important to note that given the small number of differentially expressed genes and relatively smaller magnitude of differential expression seen in the susceptible cultivar compared to the resistant, no genes met the false discovery rate  correction cut-off after infection in the susceptible cultivar . thus, these differentially expressed genes must be viewed with caution. nevertheless, it was seen that  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated, in response to xoo infection in both the resistant and susceptible cultivars , excluding genes up-regulated at one time and down-regulated at another time. thus, in terms of timing, number and magnitude, the transcriptomic response in the resistant cultivar was greater than the susceptible cultivar in response to xoo infection.

in order to identify any relation between the observed expression and function of the encoded genes, pageman over-representation analysis was carried out  <cit> . overall, it was evidenced that from  <dig> hpi, genes encoding photosynthesis components were down-regulated and genes encoding stress response functions were up-regulated in both the resistant and susceptible cultivars . the down-regulation of genes encoding major cho metabolism, cell wall, secondary metabolism functions and specific tf families, was seen to be a unique response only to resistant infection . similarly, the up-regulation of lipid metabolism, secondary metabolism functions and down-regulation of redox and polyamine metabolism was largely seen only in the response to infection in the susceptible cultivar. interestingly, in the resistant cultivar, genes encoding signalling, rna processing, rna binding, nac and wrky tfs were seen to be significantly over-represented, as well as translations functions including genes encoding ribosomal proteins . a recent study analysed the transcriptomic response to bacterial infection with xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola  in a susceptible cultivar, and when these microarrays were analysed in parallel to those shown here , it was seen that the transcriptomic response showed some conservation to that seen in response to xoo infection in this study, including the up-regulation of pathogen related stress responsive genes and down-regulation of photosystem i components . in addition, the down-regulation of genes encoding cellulose synthesis functions, isoprenoid metabolism, yabby transcription factors  and sulphate transporters was also seen under both xoo infection  and xoc infection  <cit>  , suggesting common transcriptomic responses under these bacterial infections. overall, the analyses carried out in this study have confirmed features seen in previous studies, and identified additional responses in the resistant compared to susceptible cultivars.

the microarray experiments are classified as biotic and abiotic stress. for each microarray dataset, a brief experimental description is given with the respective cultivar  indicated, reference , public gene expression omnibus  identifier or miame genexpress identifier , the number of biological replications carried out , the number of arrays carried out in that experiment and the tissue analysed are shown.

common and distinct transcriptomic responses to biotic stress
in order to investigate the overlap in transcriptomic responses to stress, nearly  <dig> microarrays analysing responses to infection with bacteria, xoo – this study; xoc -  <cit> ; parasite, s.hermonthica -  <cit> ; virus – gse11025; fungus, m.grisae -  <cit> , m.oyzae –  <cit>  and abiotic stress –  <cit>  were examined . in this way, it was possible to determine the number of genes differentially expressed in response to each stress, the number of those that overlap with the response to resistant infection to xoo , and the number that differed to xoo . it can be seen that the largest number of genes that showed a common response to xoo infection was for the genes responding to susceptible leaf infection with m.grisea <cit> , where  <dig> genes showed overlapping responses . similarly, the response to drought  and salt  also showed large overlapping responses with resistant infection to xoo. however, it is important to note that the overall number of differentially expressed transcripts in response to m.grisea, drought and salt were more than double the number of transcripts responding to bacterial infection with xoo  indicating that these only represent a small proportion of the total transcriptomic response to these stresses.

given that all of these microarrays were analysed in parallel , it was also possible to identify highly stress responsive genes across both biotic and abiotic stresses and in this way, a shortlist of  <dig> genes were identified that were differentially expressed across  <dig> or more stresses . these genes were analysed for over-represented functional categories and it was seen that these were enriched in genes encoding wrky tfs, ap2/erebp tfs and unclassified tfs, example genes from these categories are shown in figure 3b . in addition, as expected, abc transporters and multidrug resistance functions encoding proteins as well as other “stress response” categories were also seen to be highly significantly enriched in this geneset, examples of these genes such as loc_os5g <dig>   are shown in figure 3b). interestingly, of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes are annotated as “expressed protein”  with  <dig> of these encoding rice lineage specific genes . given that the genes and functional categories seen in this geneset represent a significant over-representation of functions that are highly characteristic of the plant stress response, it is very likely that these  <dig> genes  represent crucial proteins involved in the abiotic and biotic stress response. this is particularly likely given that a number of proteins, such as those encoding wrky and nac tfs within this dataset represent genes that are known to result in increased sensitivity to stress when these genes are knocked-out/overexpressed  <cit> .

although more genes showed overlapping responses  than opposite responses  across the different stresses, it can be observed that some genes were up-regulated under bacterial infection and down-regulated under other stresses e.g. an ap <dig> transcription factor  which is highly up-regulated under bacterial, parasite and fungal infection and is down-regulated in response to viral infection . similarly, two genes encoding an acidic endochitinase  and chitinase  <dig>  were up-regulated under biotic infections, and down-regulated in response to abiotic stress . in addition, specific kinases , was seen to be induced in response to bacterial, parasite, fungal and viral infection, whilst significant down-regulation was observed in response to cold and heat stress. given that these experiments were carried out in different laboratories, it is acknowledged that antagnostic responses may be due to experimental design, and thus in defining these criteria, only genes that were significantly up-regulated in one stress and down-regulated in another or vice versa were defined as antagonistic. notably, one gene was up-regulated across all  <dig> stresses and this is annotated to encode a q-rich domain containing protein . interestingly, the second most differentially expressed gene , encodes a gene with no known functional information to date, however this gene has been previously defined as lineage specific  <cit> , i.e. only present in rice and therefore could not be identified by orthology .

given that these analyses have examined the transcriptomic response to a number of biotic and abiotic stresses in parallel, it was possible to use this data to identify genes that were only responsive to biotic stress. in this way,  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed across  <dig> or more biotic stresses  were identified . these were also examined for over-represented functional categories and it was seen that there was an enrichment of genes encoding protein degradation functions, specifically subtilases, cytochrome p <dig> components, glutathione-s-transferases, ppr repeat containing proteins, proteins involved in cell organisation and as expected, proteins annotated as encoding pathogenesis related functions . the expression of the top  responsive genes is shown, as well as examples of genes from over-represented functional categories in figure 3c. interestingly, of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes are annotated as “expressed protein”  with  <dig> of these encoding rice lineage specific genes . for example the lineage specific rice gene loc_os08g <dig> , was seen to be up-regulated specifically in response to bacterial, parasite and fungal infections independently, whilst not responding to abiotic stress, suggesting a fundamental role in biotic stress response that is specific to rice .

it is evidenced that there are overlaps in the transcriptomic responses to various biotic stresses , however, it is unknown how well conserved the transcriptomic response to resistance is across these different biotic stresses. to determine whether there is overlap in the genes responding only to resistant infection for individual biotic stresses,  <dig> genes  were defined as differentially expressed only in the resistant cultivars  to the three biotic stresses . of these, a significant enrichment  of signalling/receptor kinases and transferases were seen for the up-regulated genes, whilst the down-regulated genes were enriched in cell wall related functions and co-factor and vitamin metabolism functions, revealing that these genes may be part of a common response triggered specifically during resistant infection to bacterium/parasite/virus . in addition to identifying common genes responsive during resistance, a unique set of  <dig> genes  were also identified to be differentially expressed exclusively under resistant response to xoo infection . notably, it was seen that of these  <dig> genes ,  <dig> genes encoding protein degradation functions were down-regulated, whilst  <dig> genes encoding signalling functions were up-regulated. specifically, an oswak , a lectin-like receptor kinase, a phytosulfokine receptor precursor and a serine/threonine kinase-like protein were up-regulated exclusively under resistant xoo infection . in addition to these, an nbs-lrr type putative disease resistance protein  and a gene annotated as a resistance protein lr <dig>  were also seen to be in this set , exclusively responsive to resistant bacterial infection. genes in this exclusive set represent targets that may be specifically used as markers to analyse and understand the specific aspects of xoo infection.

it is important to note that although the genes identified in this study are conserved across different cultivars, the differences between cultivars can also be substantial, including substantial differences in stress tolerance. thus, the effect of the cultivars used must be noted  in the interpretation and application of the findings in this study.

cell wall and metabolism changes are characteristic of resistance
overall, it can be seen that despite the  <dig> genes showing overlapping responses to resistant infection , the response to bacterial infection in the resistant cultivar is still largely unique. given that a significant over-representation of specific metabolic functions, signalling, transcription factors and proteins synthesis were revealed in response to resistant bacterial infection , custom mapman images were created showing the differentially expressed transcripts  encoding cellular metabolism functions  and regulation and protein synthesis functions .

it appears that the earliest response  to bacterial infection in the resistant cultivar is the down-regulation of genes encoding cell wall functions, specifically those involving cellulose synthesis, with  <dig> of the  <dig> expressed genes encoding cellulose synthase showing significant down-regulation at  <dig> hpi in the resistant cultivar . in addition, genes encoding cell wall modification, cell wall degradation, cell organisation and the cell wall arabinogalactan proteins were also significantly down-regulated . specifically,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes encoding fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins 7/ <dig> were down-regulated at  <dig> hpi . notably, when the differential expression of these genes was examined more closely, it was seen that while this  response was also common to both resistant and susceptible parasitic infection, all  <dig> of these genes were up-regulated in response to heat stress. interestingly, proteins with a fascilin domain are known to play a role in cell adhesion  <cit> , therefore the down-regulation of these in response to resistant bacterial infection  supports a role for the suppression of these functions specifically in response to biotic infections. notably, it was seen that by  <dig> hpi, genes encoding proteins involved in cell wall precursor synthesis and glycine-rich cell wall structural proteins are up-regulated, suggesting that after an early down-regulation of cell wall modification and degradation functions at  <dig> hpi, the genes encoding cell wall structural components are then up-regulated by  <dig> hpi .

at  <dig> hpi, genes encoding gluco-, galacto-, mannosidases, udp glucosyl and glucoronyl transferases, membrane proteins and secondary metabolism functions including phenylpropanoids and isopropanoids are largely down-regulated. however, by  <dig> hpi, an increased number of genes encoding phenylpropanoid metabolism and udp glucosyl and glucoronyl transferases are significantly up-regulated . notably,  <dig> of these udp glucosyl and glucoronyl transferases encoding genes, were also up-regulated in response to resistant parasite/viral infection , boxed in yellow; figure 4). similarly,  <dig> genes encoding cytochrome  <dig> 72a <dig> were also seen to be up-regulated both at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi, in response to resistant bacterial infection, as well as in response to resistant parasite/viral infection . the overlapping up-regulation of these genes in response to resistant infection suggests that these genes may have a role specifically in the resistance responses to biotic stress.

given the significant differential expression seen for cell wall functions, it was not surprising to see differential expression of signalling functions, specifically for calcium signalling and receptor kinases. one of the differentially expressed genes encoding a receptor kinase  was identified as exclusively up-regulated both at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi exclusively in the cultivar resistant to bacterial infection . interestingly, when the expression of genes encoding kinases were compared in response to abiotic stress, it was observed that while  <dig> genes encoding kinases were up-regulated in response to resistant bacterial infection,  <dig> and  <dig> of these genes are in fact down-regulated in response to heat and drought and/or salt treatment, respectively, indicating that these receptor kinases are specifically responsive to biotic stress. furthermore,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes encoding wall associated kinases  were seen to be significantly up-regulated in response to bacterial infection in the resistant cultivar . notably, it was also seen that the expression of a rop small gtpase gene , involved in signalling was down-regulated in response to infection with xoo . it has previously been shown that osracb is associated with the plasma membrane and over-expression results in increased symptoms in response to fungal  infection  <cit> . these expression patterns suggest a strong early response to infection in the resistant cultivar, which involves both cell wall functions and signalling.

closer examination of genes encoding energy-related functions also revealed a down-regulation of genes encoding photosynthesis functions, peroxidases, oxidases, lipases and lipid transfer proteins, possibly indicative of an early energy conservation and defence response to infection . in contrast, genes encoding redox functions and fatty acid synthesis and elongation functions were up-regulated at  <dig> hpi , which is characteristic of the plant stress and defense response  <cit> . specifically, it is notable that a gene encoding cyp71p <dig> in the cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase family  was highly up-regulated in response to xoo infection. interestingly, it has recently been shown that sl <dig> is one of the earliest genes to be significantly induced, seen as early as  <dig> hour after infection with the fungus m.oryzae <cit> . it has also been shown that mutation in this gene appears to result in sekiguchi lesion formations on rice leaves, and increased resistance to fungal infection  <cit> . thus, the observed up-regulation of this gene suggests it may also have a role in lesion prevention/delay in the resistant response to bacterial  infection.

similarly, a large number of genes annotated as responsive to abiotic and biotic stress related functions were up-regulated in response to resistant infection to bacterial infection . two of these up-regulated genes encoding heat shock factors are particularly noteworthy . it has been shown that transgenic plants with suppressed spl <dig> expression resulted in increased resistance to infection  <cit> . similarly, the expression of an er-located member of the heat shock protein family was up-regulated in response to bacterial infection  and a recent study has shown that bip <dig> overexpressing plants showed compromised xa <dig> mediated immunity to xoo infection  <cit> . finding that suppression/over-expression of these genes results in significant changes to immunity indicates a functional role for the transcriptomic responses seen for these stress responsive genes, and suggesting that these are likely not to be the only genes that have a significant role in immunity.

a role for rna and protein synthesis in xoo resistance
a notable over-representation of genes encoding protein synthesis, signalling and specific transcription factors including those encoding nac and wrky tfs were observed to be up-regulated in the resistant response to bacterial infection . interestingly, an examination of the individual gene expression levels revealed a significant up-regulation of rna functions; specifically tfs, rna processing, rna binding, ribosomal proteins, protein folding and targeting at  <dig> hpi . closer examination of these genes showed that of the  <dig> genes encoding ribosomal proteins that were up-regulated in the resistant response to bacterial infection ,  <dig> of these were also up-regulated in response to fungal infection in leaves . the significant up-regulation of these in response to both bacterial and fungal infection, suggests these functions may be are actively required in response to these infections. however,  <dig> and  <dig> of these  <dig> ribosomal protein encoding genes were significantly down-regulated in the response to parasite infection  and in response to both drought and salt treatment, respectively. furthermore, it was seen that while  <dig> genes encoding heat shock proteins were up-regulated in response to resistant bacterial infection,  <dig> of these were also up-regulated in response to fungal infection , all  <dig> genes were down-regulated in response to root fungal infection with m.oryzae. these distinct responses indicate that while the up-regulation of specific functions e.g. translation appears to be a common response to resistant bacterial infection and in response to fungal infection with m.grisea, the opposite is observed in the susceptible response to parasite infection and under drought and salt stress.

a particularly interesting finding in the resistant response to bacterial infection was the over-representation of genes encoding cell cycle peptidyl isomerases. it can be seen at although  <dig> genes encoding cell cycle peptidyl isomerases were down-regulated at  <dig> hpi,  <dig> genes are up-regulated by  <dig> hpi with one of these genes  even seen to be only up-regulated in the resistant responses, to both bacterial  and parasite infection . although only  <dig> differentially expressed genes encoding cell cycle peptidyl isomerases are shown in figure  <dig>  another  <dig> genes encoding cell cycle peptidyl isomerases were also significantly up-regulated at  <dig> hpi, however these were up-regulated by  <dig> - <dig>  fold and therefore are not displayed. the finding that a significant over-representation i.e.  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes encoding these cell cycle isomerases were differentially expressed . notably, genes encoding a speckle-type poz protein  as part of the ubiquitin e <dig> complex and a subtilisin-like protease precursor  were seen to be down-regulated exclusively in the response to bacterial infection in the resistant cultivar , whilst a gene encoding a protein deaminase involved in nucleotide degradation  was down-regulated in response to both bacterial and parasite infection in the  resistant cultivars only . interestingly, several genes encoding functions annotated as involved in development were differentially expressed . notably, one of these genes encoding a member of the mtn3/saliva gene family  has previously been shown to have a role in race-specific resistance to xoo infection  <cit> . interestingly, this mtn <dig> gene was first down-regulated at  <dig> hpi, before being significantly induced at  <dig> hpi . it has been suggested that this protein may have a role in sugar transport in response to xoo infection in rice  <cit> , and the observed opposite changes in expression seen at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi  suggests that the expression of this gene may be tightly controlled in response to xoo infection.

in response to infection, a number of unclassified tfs were seen to be down-regulated . upon closer examination of these genes, it was seen that a number of these tfs have been shown to have a direct functional role in response to infection/stress. one of these genes includes a zinc finger family protein - c3h <dig>  which has recently been shown to be involved in rice resistance to xoo infection, with knock-out of this gene seen to result in partially increased susceptibility to xoo infection in zhonghu  <dig>  <cit> . upon bacterial infection in this study, c3h <dig> did not change in expression at  <dig> hpi, however, it was seen to decrease in expression at  <dig> hpi . in contrast, some of the most strongly up-regulated genes encoding regulatory functions included those encoding nac and wrky tfs . specifically,  <dig> wrky tfs that were significantly up-regulated , have been shown to result in altered resistance when knocked-out or overexpressed . it has been shown that over-expression of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> resulted in enhanced resistance to fungal infection , respectively. in contrast, plants over-expressing wrky <dig> have been shown to result in increase susceptibility to bacterial infection . this suggests a functional role for the up-regulation of these genes encoding tfs in response to infection. interestingly, previous studies analysing the role of nac tfs have mainly focussed on a role for these tfs in development and the response to abiotic stresses  <cit> . for example, nac <dig> has been shown to result in a 53-fold induction in response to drought stress  <cit>  and over-expression has been seen to result in root enlargement and increased resistance to drought stress  <cit> . however, it is likely that nac <dig> and a number of the other nac tfs seen to be induced in this study also have a role in biotic stress resistance, with one of these genes encoding nac <dig>  showing a 40-fold up-regulation at  <dig> hpi in response to bacterial infection .

furthermore, given that a number of these nac tfs are seen to be up-regulated, even as early as  <dig> hpi, all up-regulated genes in response to bacterial infection in the resistant cultivar were examined for over-represented putative cis-acting elements in the 1kb upstream regions of these genes. to do this, the 1kb upstream dna sequences of this sub-set were extracted and the occurrence of all motifs shown in agris and athamap  <cit>  were calculated for each subset, shown as a percentage, and compared to the percentage occurrence of each motif across all 1kb upstream sequences in the rice genome . all significantly  over-represented known elements  are shown in table  <dig>  interestingly, it was seen that for the genes responding to bacterial infection in the resistant cultivar, the number of up-regulated genes that contained abscisic acid response elements , heat shock elements  and nam, ataf, and cuc  elements was significantly higher than expected . this was particularly obvious for genes containing putative nac binding sites, given that  <dig> different nac elements, with a cacg core, were seen to be over-represented in the promoters of these up-regulated genes, with one of these elements, cacga, even enriched in the upstream regions of both the up-regulated and down-regulated sets of genes . notably, it was seen that when the up-regulated genes containing hses were extracted and examined, it was evidenced that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes annotated as responsive to heat stress  contained the known hse; gaagct  <cit> . similarly, when the genes that contained telobox elements were examined, it was evidenced that  <dig> out of the  <dig> ribosomal proteins contained these telobox elements . as seen for the hses, it is known that the promoter regions of ribosomal proteins are enriched in telobox elements  <cit> , thus it is possible that at one or more elements presented in table  <dig> represent functional tf binding sites.

infection in rice.

functional roles for the transcriptomic responses
in order to establish a functional link between the responses observed in this study and resistance to xoo infection, an extensive literature search was carried out mining any publications that presented data on xoo/xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae infection in rice. in this way,  <dig> genes were found, which were both expressed in the leaf tissues in this study, and were identified to have a functional role in stress resistance, given that resistance was directly altered upon knock-down/knock-out or over-expression of these genes. interestingly,  <dig> of these genes were significantly differentially expressed in response to xoo infection in this study, suggesting that these likely represent genes that are not only regulated at a transcript level in response to stress, but also have a functional role in altering resistance . the finding that suppressing/over-expressing these genes have been shown to result in altered resistance phenotypes  suggests that the response to infection, whether resistant or susceptible involves significant regulation at the transcript level.

the affymetrix probeset id, fold-change responses to: bacterial infection;  <dig>  resistant ,  <dig>  susceptible ,  <dig>  susceptible   <cit> , parasite infection  <cit> ;  <dig>  resistant ,  <dig>  susceptible , fungus;  <dig>  susceptible   <cit> ,  <dig>  susceptible   <cit> , virus;  <dig>  resistant ,  <dig>  susceptible  – gse <dig>  abiotic stress  <cit> ;  <dig>  drought,  <dig>  salt,  <dig>  cold,  <dig>  heat  <cit> . in addition, the locus identifier , gene name, phenotype and reference are also shown for each gene.

upon examination of these, it is immediately apparent that nearly all of these genes were significantly responsive at the transcript level, not only in response to bacterial infection , but also in response to a number of other biotic stresses including; parasite infection e.g. striga hermonthica <cit> , fungal infection e.g. magnoporithea grisea, magnoporithea oryzae <cit> , viral infection e.g. rice stripe virus  and abiotic stresses, such as drought, salt, cold and heat  <cit>  . each of these individual studies  <cit>  each gave insight into the plant defence response to a specific stress. however, given that plants can utilise similar defence strategies in response to different stresses, and are usually exposed to more than one stress in at a time, or over the course of the plant lifetime, it is not unexpected that the plant defence response has evolved to generate common and distinct responses that allow both flexibility and specificity of the stress response. for example,  <dig> genes encoding wrky tfs were significantly up-regulated in response to bacterial infection  and have been shown independently to result in increased resistance to bacterial and/or fungal infection when these genes were over-expressed  <cit> , with the over-expression of wrky <dig> seen to result in increased resistance to both bacterial  and fungal  infection   <cit> . similarly,  <dig> genes encoding nac tfs were induced in response to several biotic and abiotic stresses, with over-expression of these also seen to result in increased salt and/or drought tolerance   <cit> . apart from genes encoding tfs, a number of genes encoding signalling functions including g-proteins  and kinases  have also been shown to have a functional role in response to infection . notably,  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes were significantly differentially expressed in response to  <dig> or more stresses, with  <dig> of these genes differentially expressed in response to  <dig> or more stresses . thus, the genes identified in this study as responsive to multiple stresses  represent genes highly likely to be functional in stress resistance.

discussion
by examining the expression patterns of genes in response to a range of biotic stresses  in parallel, for the first time, it was possible to develop an outline or model showing similarities in the transcriptomic responses to biotic stress including infection with bacterium , fungus  <cit> , parasite  <cit>  and virus . pageman over-representation analysis  <cit>  was carried out for each of these studies in parallel, and over-represented functional categories were compared for down- and up-regulated gene-sets across each stress. figure  <dig> shows the over-represented functional categories, the common response to infection with bacterium, parasite, fungus and virus are shown in purple font, in green font , orange  and brown . it appears that in response to all four biotic stresses , there is significant down-regulation of nucleotide metabolism functions and an up-regulation of genes encoding calcium signalling functions, miscellaneous transport functions, biotic and abiotic stress-response functions, glutathione s-transferases and both wrky and nac transcription factors . studies have shown a crucial role for the induction of calcium-signalling in response to abiotic stress, with the over-expression of specific factors seen to result in increased stress tolerance in transgenic plants  <cit> . interestingly, a recent study also showed that arbuscular mycorrhizal  symbiosis in rice results in the induction of defence-related genes in leaves, including some crucial components involved in calcium signalling, ultimately resulting in resistance to pathogen infection  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that components of calcium signalling are functional in general stress recognition, including in response to biotic stress .

in addition to calcium signalling, a conserved up-regulation of specific nac and wrky tfs were also evidenced across all the biotic stresses analysed . the importance of transcriptional regulation in response to infection is most notably evidenced by the significant alteration in resistance or stress response, seen in rice plants following knock-out/over-expression of specific nac and wrky transcription factors   <cit> . these nac and wrky transcription factors clearly appear to not only be regulated at the transcript level in response to infection, but are also directly involved in regulating transcript abundance, given their role as transcription factors. furthermore, apart from the genes encoding glutathione s-transferases, genes in all of the other functional categories  contained significant enrichment of putative nac binding elements in the promoter regions of these genes, which suggests that these genes, including the wrky tfs, may be regulated by nac tfs . a recent study has even experimentally confirmed the relationship between a nac and wrky tf  <cit> , supporting a conserved and related role for these tfs. notably, a literature search was also carried out to determine the role of nac tfs in this study, and it was found that  <dig> nac transcription factors that were differentially expressed in response to xoo infection , have been shown result in increased stress tolerance, specifically to salt and/or drought stress, when over-expressed in rice  <cit> .

examining the transcriptomic responses to different biotic stresses in parallel this way, revealed that the response to viral infection is rather distinct from bacterial, parasite and fungal infection, with fewer functional categories showing overlapping responses . this may reflect a different mode of defence response that may more be specific to viral infection. it is evidenced that genes encoding photosystem components  and co-factor and vitamin metabolism were also down-regulated . a previous study has shown that when osdr <dig>  was genetically repressed in expression, increased susceptibility to bacterial  and fungal  infection was observed  <cit> . notably, this gene was seen to be down-regulated in response to bacterial infection and other biotic stresses . in contrast, genes encoding ribosomal proteins, udp-glucosyl and gluconyl transferases, heat-stress responsive proteins, and proteins involved in cell wall precursor synthesis were up-regulated, which is a conserved response following bacterial, fungal and viral infection . notably, closer examination revealed that many of the heat-stress responsive proteins  encode heat shock factors. while heat shock factors are typically induced under heat stress  <cit>  and very well known for their functional role in abiotic stress  <cit> , a recent study has shown that xa <dig> mediated resistance to bacterial blight  was in fact more effective at high temperatures  <cit> , indicating an possible conserved role of these factors not only in abiotic stress, but also across biotic stresses . in addition, a conserved down-regulation of genes encoding nucleotide degradation and post-translational modification was seen in response to bacterial, parasite and viral infection. it is important to note that although the genes or expression responses identified in this study may show conservation across different stresses in different cultivars, the basal differences between cultivars can also be substantial, including substantial differences in stress tolerance. thus, the effect of the cultivars used must be noted  in the interpretation and application of the findings in this study.

overall, it is apparent that there is much overlap in the transcriptomic response to bacterial, parasite and fungal infection . this is particularly interesting for genes encoding signalling functions, with a common up-regulation seen for genes encoding receptor kinases, hormone metabolism, brassinosteriod synthesis and calcium signalling following bacterial, fungal or parasite infection . the overlap in response to bacterial and fungal infection is not unexpected, given that a number of studies have shown common defence responses to these infections. for example, activation of a gene encoding an indole-3-acetic acid -amido synthetase  has been shown to result in in enhanced resistance to both bacterial  and fungal  infection  <cit> . similarly, oswrky <dig> overexpressing plants have also been found to result in increased resistance to both xoo and m.grisea infection  <cit> , while oswrky <dig> overexpressing plants were seen to result in increased susceptibility, also to both xoo and m.grisea infection  <cit> . examination of the transcript responses of these genes reveals conserved and distinct transcriptomic responses to these biotic and abiotic stresses . for genes showing conserved, strong transcriptomic responses to multiple stresses, it is likely that these genes play a role in responses to these multiple stresses. for example, in this study, it can be seen that nac <dig> is highly induced in response to  <dig> of the  <dig> stresses analysed, specifically a 53-fold induction is seen in response to drought and recent study showed that over-expression of nac <dig> results in root enlargement and increased resistance to drought stress  <cit> . however, given that this gene is also strongly induced  in response to bacterial, parasite and fungal infection , it is very possible that nac <dig> has a role in biotic stress resistance as well.

interestingly, examining the bacterial transcriptomic response “in the context” of the other biotic stress responses as done in this study, has revealed that the down-regulation of genes encoding photorespiration functions, metalloproteases, sugar transport and sucrose/starch degradation  are seen more specifically in response to bacterial infection. similarly, the enrichment of cell cycle peptidylprolyl isomerases and aba and ga metabolism in the up-regulated gene-sets were also only seen in response to bacterial infection . given that  <dig> of the  <dig> cell cycle peptidylprolyl isomerases expressed in leaves were differentially expressed in response to bacterial infection, this suggests a role for these in the plant defense response to bacterial infection. cell cycle peptidylprolyl isomerases have been well characterised in humans, specifically for their role in immunity  <cit> . these proteins are known to associate with heat shock proteins and have been shown to play a role as parasitic chaperones  <cit> . their up-regulation in the rice response to bacterial infection in the resistant cultivar could suggest a role for these in the plant defence response as well.

interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> oswaks  were differentially expressed during resistant bacterial infection. it has been shown that the rice genome has significantly more waks than arabidopsis thaliana and it was revealed that this increased number is not only due to the larger genome size  <cit> . in fact, this study revealed that distinct groups of oswaks have evolved in rice, suggesting unique roles for these have evolved, that are specifically necessary only in rice . similarly, the up-regulation of genes encoding amino acid metabolism, secondary metabolism - flavonoid and phenylpropanoid metabolism was also conserved . in contrast, genes encoding cell wall proteins, fatty acid desaturation functions and oxidative pentose phosphate pathway proteins showed a conserved down-regulation response to bacterial, fungal and parasite infection . overall, in response to bacterial infection, the earliest responses occur at the cell wall, where this significant down-regulation of transcripts encoding cell wall proteins and cellulose synthesis occurs, while a number of signalling proteins including kinases and g-proteins are up-regulated, as early as  <dig> hpi . upon reception of these signals, nac and wrky transcription factors are up-regulated, along with genes known to be involved in the general biotic stress responses . the functional role for a number of these has been shown in response to biotic and abiotic stresses . therefore the genelists presented in this study represent genes that are highly likely to have a functional role in one or more biotic stress responses.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first study in rice that has examined global transcriptomic responses to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses in parallel to present a model for the biotic stress response in rice and reveal signature genes that represent responses unique to each biotic stress, as well as identify novel genes, some even lineage specific, that are “universally” stress responsive. the small number of antagonistic responses between abiotic and biotic stresses observed in signalling and regulation components needs to be further investigated, as they may present a barrier to developing plants with resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. it is now evidenced that specific signalling components, nac and wrky transcription factors, in addition to a number of other specific genes, represent common responses to biotic stresses. furthermore, extensive data mining showed that many of the genes identified by the analyses in this study have been shown to have a functional role in stress resistance, given that knock-down/out or over-expression of these genes have previously been shown to result in altering stress tolerance of the resulting transgenic plants. thus, the genes identified in this study provide precise targets to over-express or manipulate in order to develop multiple resistances to stress.
