BACKGROUND
most researchers keep a serviceable mental model of how molecules of interest react with each other in various cellular pathways. such qualitative models suffice for many purposes. they can, however, break down when trying to explain more complex interactions between molecules, e.g., when a molecule participates in multiple pathways; when the activity or the appearance of the molecule is dependent on multiple reactions; when the timing of reactions is important; when multiple processes interact, etc. for such reasons, quantitative modeling of complex biologic processes, such as the eukaryote cell cycle, has been practiced for many decades.  these efforts have produced descriptions of cell-cycle subprocesses  and predictions  beyond the realm of mental models.

as the work reported here involves cell-cycle modeling as an example of modeling complex biologic processes, a brief summary and discussion of recent eukaryote cell-cycle work follows. chen et al.  <cit>  examined the cell-cycle regulation of budding yeast. novak and tyson  <cit>  extended this work to mammalian cells, proceeding on a generalization by nurse  <cit>  that molecular cell-cycle controls are similar in all eukaryotes. novak and tyson also used the model to examine restriction point control. other efforts have continued this trend of quantitative models being used to examine a number of specific cell-cycle subprocesses and extensions: localization  <cit> , checkpoints  <cit> , apoptosis  <cit> , multisite phosphorylation  <cit> , cell growth and size control  <cit> , etc. several efforts also have looked at the nonlinear dynamics of cell-cycle regulation  <cit> .

in detail most of the models used in these efforts are different; however, in general they are constructed in a similar fashion. all consist of coupled ordinary differential equations , typically based on wiring diagrams of the molecular pathways of importance to the cell cycle . the equations of state are based on specific molecules, and the solutions are for the concentration of each important molecule. although most state equations are based on simple mass action kinetics, the rate constants are often enhanced with combinations of constants or with other functions , presumably necessary to achieve appropriate behavior. an exception is the use of diffusion equations  for membrane transport in the work of yang et al.  <cit> . rate constants and initial concentrations are based, where possible, on experimental data; although as noted by  <cit> , few if any of these values have been measured directly and they must be estimated, typically by trial and error. cell division, when included in a model, is achieved by reducing the cell size by one half . growth of the cell as well as transcription and translation of the regulatory proteins  are infrequently accounted in these models . when growth is accounted, the purpose is to investigate size control--the idea that the cell must reach a certain size for some of the cell-cycle regulatory processes to occur. yang et al.  <cit>  used cell volume and nuclear-membrane surface area to model size control. qu et al.  <cit>  based size control on growth-signal transduction being proportional to membrane surface area. csikász-nagy et al.  <cit>  discussed the synthesis rates of cyclins as a form of size control. other aspects of cell growth e.g., energy usage or membrane synthesis, are not considered in these models. in these efforts, steady-state  behavior of the models is rarely discussed.

the work presented here follows in the footsteps of the efforts discussed above. one missing element in these efforts, and other modeling efforts dealing with complex biologic processes, is a framework with which to capture the necessarily increasing scope and detail that such quantitative models will achieve as they progress. a framework for modeling the mammalian cell cycle is proposed here. the proposed framework is composed of two constructs, which describe  a molecule lifecycle and  basic cellular machinery--which is in turn built of molecule-lifecycle constructs. the constructs are based on techniques used in system dynamics  <cit> . although at first glance cumbersome, it offers a structure that readily allows modification and extension. a benefit of the framework is that it allows accounting of all processes that are important to a cell-biologic system in a straightforward and rigorous manner to the extent currently possible. another benefit is that using the framework, a researcher can first concentrate on modeling each individual molecule, then on the interactions of the molecules, then on the interactions between the molecules and the functioning of the cell.

as in most previous work, the framework is based on coupled odes. a number of different computational techniques have been proposed and investigated for modeling biological pathways, including stochastic petri nets , p systems , brane calculus , rule-based modeling , combination approaches , etc. for a general discussion see  <cit> . each of these techniques has merit, although none solve the problem of complexity that will be encountered as models necessarily increase in scope and detail. coupled odes are used here because they have been traditionally used, they can deal with large numbers of molecules and, with the framework described here, they can be derived and solved with relative facility. the implications of using coupled odes are discussed in additional file  <dig> 

to demonstrate the use of the framework constructs, a model of the growth and division of a mammalian cell is presented. the model consists of several hundred odes and parameters, but it tracks molecules from birth to death, accounts for nuclear compartmentalization, and operates respecting the underlying use of amino acids, nucleotides, atp, mrna, rrna, etc. the model executes relatively quickly, but requires a stiff equation solver  because of the disparity in the timescales of the reactions. the model returns interesting, albeit unconfirmed, predictions. the model also demonstrates that the framework is useful, not the least because the major effort was not in the creation of the model, but in the calibration.

what likens the work presented here to other mammalian cell-cycle modeling efforts are  the use of odes to describe the mass action kinetics of chemical reactions and thereby provide a quantitative basis for the modeling ,  the use of researcher-developed state and rate equations, based on literature sources where possible, and  the use of researcher-estimated parameters . a conscious attempt was made here to use the simplest form of mass action kinetic equation for each interaction, although some processes were simplified to the extent that more complicated expressions had to be used, e.g., for proton transport across the mitochondrial membrane. some researchers have attempted to use a standard set of kinetic parameters and parameter estimation techniques ; in this work, the need to meet multiple global and local constraints for calibration at both steady state and cell cycling militated against this approach. an attempt was made to match concentration values, which partially constrain kinetic rates, to those reported in the literature.

what differentiates this work from other efforts are the aspects that involve completeness and comprehensiveness that are allowed by the framework. the example model describes both steady-state  behavior and dynamic growth and division of a cell, using the same set of kinetic parameters. the model describes in a comprehensive fashion many processes that are individually examined in other efforts: nuclear localization , membrane transport , and growth factors . the model describes in a comprehensive fashion many processes that are omitted from other efforts: usage of sugars, atp, nucleotides, and amino acids, synthesis of rnas--mrna, rrna, trna, and snrna--and the action of multiple transcription factors . further, the production and degradation of all molecules in the model are tracked . details concerning features and operation of the model are presented in additional file  <dig>  as a final differentiation, this work is not directed at a specific biological issue--although some biological predictions are presented and an investigation of a redundant pathway is included in additional file 4--rather, it addresses what will be necessary to progress the modeling of complex biologic processes.

RESULTS
molecule-lifecycle construct
state and rate equations are assigned to the construct in a straightforward manner as follows. the change in the number of molecules in a given state is dependent on the number of molecules entering that state, minus the number of molecules leaving that state, as described by the ode dc/dt = rin - rout , where c is the concentration of molecules of a given molecule type in a given state, t is time, dc/dt is the change over time in the concentration of molecules, rin is the rate of molecules entering the state, and rout is the rate of molecules leaving the state. rates can apply to chemical reactions or transition from one compartment in a cell to another. rates are typically calculated as the product of a rate constant and the concentration of one or more molecules: r = kc1c <dig> .., where k is the rate constant, c <dig> is the concentration of the first reactant, c <dig> is the concentration of the second reactant, etc. parameter values that are unknown and must be fitted to the model are the rate constants and the initial concentrations of the states. the construct shown in figure  <dig> is a simplification; seven states typically represent the lifecycle for a protein in the example cell-cycle model, and five states represent the lifecycle of the mrna for the protein. the most complex molecule lifecycle construct in the example model is for cyca; it includes  <dig> states and  <dig> rates describing interactions of cyca with cdk <dig>  p <dig>  and cdk <dig>  as well as cyca activity in cytosol and in the nucleus .

framework overview--cell growth
underlying the example mammalian cell-cycle model is a construct that ties the cell cycle to the rest of the cell and ensures overall self-consistency:  it is used for calibration purposes ;  it calculates available quantities of cellular nucleotides , amino acids , rna, atp, proteins, and lipids over time;  it calculates the transcription rate and the translation rate for the entire cell;  it is used to determine the normalized size of the cell , which is used to estimate the concentrations of all molecules.

the basic-cellular-machinery model consists of  <dig> odes and  <dig> rate equations . figure  <dig> shows the framework of the model construct . the molecular lifecycles interact through their rate equations; the thinner lines in figure  <dig> indicate the interactions. for example, the number of trna being bound to amino acids  is a function of the number of amino acids available , which ultimately influences the number of proteins being translated . in the diagram, the thin lines from the use of atp are omitted, but they would extend to most of the rates.

framework overview--cell-cycle regulation
the cell-cycle model calculates the quantities of  <dig> proteins, and their concomitant  <dig> mrnas, over time. these proteins constitute an approximate minimum set necessary to describe the mammalian cell cycle. table  <dig> summarizes these proteins and their interactions. illustrations of the lifecycle diagrams of these proteins are presented in additional file  <dig>  many of these "proteins" are not strictly single molecules, but rather abstractions of proteins that include representative members of protein complexes and pathways . the example model exclusive of the basic-cellular-machinery model consists of  <dig> odes and approximately  <dig> rate equations .

testing
a brief overview of the example cell-cycle model results are presented here. see additional file  <dig> for a more complete description.

cell growth
the results start with a cell in steady state, g <dig> phase. the cell cycle then consists of doubling the cell's contents, followed by the division of the cell in two. g <dig> is the initial growth phase; s phase is when dna is replicated; g <dig> is the later growth phase; m is the division phase. in the results presented here, g <dig> begins at 2× <dig> seconds  with the imposition of mitogen and adhesion factors. although no steady-state results are presented, the g <dig> values are indicated in the early time values in the plots that follow.

the example model tracks a single cell. figure  <dig> shows how the number of proteins in this cell varies over  <dig> days. protein number increases starting at  <dig>  days and then suffers an abrupt decline at  <dig> days when the cell divides; the cycle is then repeated approximately every  <dig>  days. the rate of growth slows near the peak of the curve, when transcription and translation slow during m phase. the peaks and troughs of each cycle are not equal ; however, the example model cycles within reasonable bounds for dozens of cell divisions.

in the model, cell growth rate is directly related to the number of active rna polymerases. figure  <dig> shows how numbers of rna polymerase  vary from state to state as the cell cycle progresses. during g <dig> phase, ~3× <dig> rna polymerases are present  <cit> , but most are held inactive by cycc/cdk <dig>  <cit> . the substantial excess of rna polymerase is necessary for the cell cycle to initiate and progress at a reasonable rate; without this excess during g <dig>  approximately a week is needed to build up enough rna polymerase before the cell can divide. one prediction of the model  is that maintaining this pool of rna polymerase is a major determinant as to whether the cell is actually capable of dividing.

mitogen causes inactivation of cycc/cdk <dig> beginning at 2× <dig> seconds or ~ <dig>  days in the example model , allowing most rna polymerase to activate. in the model, active rna polymerase continually attach and detach from dna, polymerizing mrna when attached. rna polymerase numbers increase during the cell cycle because some of the new mrna being generated is for new rna polymerase; rna polymerase transcription is enhanced by c-myc . rna polymerase continues to transcribe mrna throughout s phase . during m phase, initially at  <dig>  days, apc acts to release rna polymerase from dna. when initially unbound, these rna polymerases are still active, but they are inactivated as cdc <dig> reactivates cycc/cdk <dig>  some rna polymerase remains bound to dna through the cell division .

the initial cell cycle after g <dig> is prolonged by a few hours while the active rna polymerase builds the appropriate amounts of rrna, trna, and dna polymerase. in subsequent cell cycles, large amounts of these molecules plus activated rna polymerase are available sooner, thus allowing for quicker growth and a shorter cycle time.

cell-cycle regulation
g <dig> steady state is maintained primarily by p <dig>  application of mitogen and adhesion factor initiates g <dig>  the duration of the initial g <dig> is approximately  <dig> hours; subsequent g <dig> phases last approximately  <dig> hours; the initial g <dig> after g <dig> is timed by p <dig>  subsequent g <dig> phases are timed primarily by apc. mitogen cause the accumulation of cyclins and kpc. the presence of both mitogen and adhesion factor are required for cyca accumulation. the cyclins  bind with their appropriate kinases ; cdks are for the most part constitutive. the cyc/cdk are bound and inhibited by p <dig>  cycd/cdk4or <dig>  whether bound to p <dig> or free, releases inhibitor rb from the e2f transcription factor , e2f then induces many cell-cycle and cell-growth proteins.

three other transcription factors are included in the example model: b-myb, nf-y, and a generic tf-grow, which is meant to represent c-myc, c-jun, notch, etc. these transcription factors induce a number of other molecules . the amount of induction is calculated as the product of factors quantifying the visibility of the gene locus and the amount of the transcription factor . the amount of the transcription factor is often added to that of other transcription factors or a constitutive factor to determine the overall multiplicative effect. transcription in total is limited by the number of rna polymerase and nucleotides; thus, the transcription factors determine what fraction of transcription is devoted to a particular gene. similarly, translation in total is limited by the number of ribosomes and amino acids; thus, the amount of each mrna determines what fraction of translation is devoted to a particular protein.

the accumulating cyc/cdk eventually bind all p <dig>  allowing the accumulation of active  cyc/cdk , which cause an abrupt release of the p27-bound cyc/cdk. free p <dig> are ubiquitinated by kpc.

a timing problem occurs because cyce, its activator cdc25a, and its ubiquitinator fbw <dig> are all induced at the same time in g <dig> by the e2f transcription factors. the model explains how the activities of these molecules occur at different times as follows. constitutive apc ubiquitinates both cdc25a  and scf , but scf is ubiquitinated more effectively than cdc25a. thus, as the concentration of active apc decreases during g <dig> with the accumulation of cycd/cdk4or <dig>  first cdc25a appears and abruptly activates the newly p27-unbound cyce/cdk <dig> , then scf appears and binds fbw <dig> and ubiquitinates cyce.  ubiquitination of cyce subsequently frees cdk <dig> for binding to cyca during s phase.

iwamoto et al.  <cit>  postulate an intermediate factor "x" for the delay between the accumulation of cyce and cyca during g <dig>  the example model does include nf-y as an additional transcription factor for cyca. the delay, however, is caused primarily by apc ubiquitination of cyca  does not interact with cyce). apc is not included in the iwamoto et al. model.

another timing problem occurs because scf must bind, in turn, subunit fbw <dig>  then subunit skp <dig>  then subunit btrc . the three subunits are present at the same time beginning in g <dig>  this timing problem is solved in the model by scf having greater affinity for fbw <dig> than skp <dig>  and having greater affinity for skp <dig> than btrc. all of these scf complexes autoubiquitinate when no substrate is present  <cit> . so, scf preferentially binds fbw <dig>  which autoubiquitinates when cyce is gone; then scf preferentially binds skp <dig>  which autoubiquitinates when p <dig>  cyce, e2f, and rc  are gone; then scf binds btrc. in the model, only the subunits autoubiquitinate, leaving scf to immediately bind another subunit  <cit> .

the cyce/cdk2-cdc25a cascade marks entry into s phase, which lasts approximately  <dig> hours. e2f induces proteins such as orc <dig> and cdc <dig> that contribute to dna replication complexes . rc mark  <dig>  binding locations on dna and, when activated by cyce/cdk <dig> or cyca/cdk <dig>  allow binding of dna polymerase to these locations and subsequent dna replication  <cit> . figure  <dig> indicates how rc are first bound to dna, then how rc are licensed , then how rc are traversed  by dna polymerase. the model includes continual rc binding and unbinding from dna, as well as continual decay of the rc. dna polymerase only attach and traverse licensed rc. approximately  <dig> dna polymerase are present during s phase. after dna polymerase bind the rc, the rc become delicensed. delicensed rc are released from the dna and ubiquitinated by scf  <cit> .

growth continues throughout s phase. therefore, the initiation of g <dig> is inexact. the initial g <dig> phase lasts approximately  <dig> hours; subsequent g <dig> phases last approximately  <dig> hours. although the amount of dna is double during g <dig>  the transcription rate does not increase--transcription rate is dependent on the number of rna polymerase.

the termination of g <dig> occurs abruptly, with the cycb/cdk1-cdc25c cascade. figure  <dig> shows that inactive cycb/cdk <dig> begins accumulating at the beginning during s phase, but at a much faster rate than does cyca/cdk <dig>  the numbers of cycb/cdk <dig> are much greater because of greater transcription and because most cyca binds nuclear cdk <dig>  in the model, wee <dig> suppresses cycb/cdk <dig> more strongly than it suppresses cyca/cdk <dig>  hence, the activation cascade between cycb/cdk <dig> and cdc25c is delayed when compared with the cyca/cdk1-cdc25b cascade. as with cyca/cdk <dig>  cycb/cdk <dig> is translocated to the nucleus after activation by plk <dig> 

in the model, there is included an intermediary step of a cyca/cdk1-cdc25b cascade, and this process could add more complication than necessary. some evidence supporting this complication is suggested by  <cit> . this intermediary step does allow cycb/cdk <dig> and cdc25c to remain completely inactive during most of g <dig>  also, it offers an explanation why cyca binds cdk <dig> and apparently participates in g2/m. and it offers an explanation why cdc25b is apparently required for viability while cdc25c apparently is not.  in the model, cdc25b can substitute for cdc25c in the cycb/cdk1-cdc25c cascade, albeit less efficiently than cdc25c, but cdc25c cannot substitute in the cyca/cdk1-cdc25b cascade because it is very inactive. therefore, cdc25b is essential in the model, but cdc25c is dispensable. as mentioned in calibration of the model , however, calibration might be improved in these areas.

m phase lasts approximately  <dig> hours and follows the cycb/cdk1-cdc25c cascade. m phase is stylized in the example model. there is no explicit modeling of the subphases  and the mechanics of division are implied by the lifecycles of a few molecules.

one consequence of the activation of cycb/cdk1at g2/m is the phosphorylation of emi <dig>  phosphorylation of emi <dig> causes it to release cdc <dig> and cdh <dig>  in the model, apc binding with cdc <dig> is favored over its binding with cdh <dig>  apc is activated  in the nucleus by cyca/cdk <dig>  cyca/cdk <dig>  and cycb/cdk <dig>  apc then ubiquitinates securin.

securin accumulation begins early in g <dig>  culminating in its ubiquitination during and after g2/m. one role of securin is to inhibit cdc <dig> ; once securin is ubiquitinated, cdc <dig> can be activated by plk <dig>  another role of securin is keep chromotids connected. with the ubiquitination of securin, the chromosome pairs separate and the cell divides.

discussion
predictions
predictions are here defined as necessary model features or model results that are not well known in the field of cell biology, that are not readily accepted, or that contradict current interpretations. more explanation of the evidence for predictions can be found in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

system-level predictions
• when redundant pathways can activate a time-critical process, one preferred pathway must inactivate the other redundant pathways. this prediction was discovered studying the inactivation of wee <dig>  or by cdc25a). the explanation is that with redundant pathways, only one pathway must operate to assure correct timing; if both operate, the end reaction will proceed too quickly . this finding has possible implications for understanding cyce-knockout and cdc25c-knockout experiments , because these knockouts could involve redundant pathways.

• explicit growth monitoring is unnecessary during the mammalian cell cycle. abundances of major reactants that advance the cell cycle are explicitly tied to overall cell growth, and the progression of the cell-cycle phases is, for the most part, dependent on cell growth. the ability to alter the timing of the cell cycle by artificially introduced regulatory proteins  supports this finding. novak and tyson  <cit>  propose that a "timer" process--similar to the prediction stated here--takes over in the cell cycle after a certain size is reached. csikász-nagy et al.  <cit>  propose an "oscillator" process--similar to the prediction here--for quickly growing cells. qu et al.  <cit>  and yang et al.  <cit>  offer alternative viewpoints based on concentrations constrained by membrane transport.

• pre-translation mrna regulation  is unnecessary during the cell cycle. here, pre-translation mrna regulation is defined as the process of limiting abundances of specific proteins by storing, destroying, or specifically selecting for translation their mrna, e.g., by rna interference or by storage of mrna.

• transcription and translation  continues during s phase at unimpeded rates. if transcription and translation ceased during s phase, the duration of the modeled cell cycle would be extended by several hours, which would not match observations.

• because a significant number of dna polymerase is needed in short order during the initial cell cycle from g <dig>  either a supply of dna polymerase must be kept inactive during g <dig> or intense transcription and translation activity must occur and be controlled at a saturation level .

• cdc25a and cdc25b cooperate to instigate the cycb/cdk1-cdc25c cascade and the g2/m transition. evidence from the model is as follows. negating the dephosphorylation of cycb/cdk <dig> by cdc25a lengthens g <dig> significantly. similarly, reducing the ubiquitination of cdc25a by scf shortens g <dig> significantly.  is completely removed, however, the timing of g2/m is unaffected in the model and as noted experimentally by  <cit> .) and negating the dephosphorylation of cyca/cdk <dig> by cdc25b also appreciably lengthens g <dig> 

• during g <dig>  a readily available supply of inactive rna polymerase must be present in cells that are capable of dividing. in the model the supply is in the form of rna polymerases held inactive by cycc/cdk <dig>  without this supply, it would take approximately a week for the cell to produce enough rna polymerases to initiate the first cell division after g <dig> 

• scf progressively complexes with fbw <dig>  skp <dig>  and btrc through the cell cycle because of differences in affinity of these subunits with scf and because of autoubiquitination in the absence of substrates.

• part of the timing of g1/s is determined by a preference for apc to ubiquitinate scf over cdc25a, allowing the cyce/cdk2-cdc25a cascade to proceed before scf/fbw <dig> ubiquitinates cyce.

• transcription factors act multiplicatively.

• all cell-cycle reactions are interconnected with each other and with the basic cellular machinery.

molecular-level predictions
• p <dig> is important for maintaining g <dig> and for timing the duration of g <dig> in the first cell cycle after exiting g <dig>  p <dig> does not have a significant role in timing g <dig> in continuous cell cycling. the duration of g <dig> in subsequent cell cycles is timed by apc.

• p <dig> does not inhibit cycd/cdk <dig> or cycd/cdk <dig> activity, although p <dig> does bind these complexes . the reason for this ineffectiveness is that growth induced by cycd/cdk4or <dig> must proceed while p <dig> is still available, especially in consecutive cell cycles. p <dig> does block cyce/cdk <dig> and is important in timing s phase in the first cycle after g <dig> 

• cycd/cdk4or <dig> does not activate dna replication complexes. these cycd complexes are active throughout g <dig>  s, and g2; if they activate rc, dna replication would occur throughout much of the cell cycle.

• wee <dig> spontaneously reactivates, either because of spontaneous dephosphorylation or because of continuous dephosphorylation by action of a phosphatase, perhaps pp2a  <cit> . there would otherwise be no need for scf to ubiquitinate wee <dig> 

• plk <dig> is the primary inactivator of wee <dig> . plk <dig> has more consistent active concentrations than other candidates  over the first cycle after g <dig> and subsequent cycles.

• the reason why cyca binds cdk <dig> is so that cyca/cdk <dig> can react with either cdc25a or cdc25b and "prime the pump" for the cycb/cdk1-cdc25c cascade.

• not all rna polymerase are removed from condensed dna during mitosis; the number attached is approximately the number active during g <dig> 

parameter estimation
the parameters for the example model were determined by generate and test, albeit highly constrained by calibration . changes to some input parameters in the example cell-cycle model can currently cause large effects on the solution, including numerical instabilities. evolution likely determined the set of initial values and rate constants that minimize sensitivity to change, and the model should be likewise calibrated. the author knows of no work in automatically determining the most robust set of parameters for a coupled-ode model with multiple time-based constraints. such a method would benefit not just cell-cycle modeling, but modeling complex biologic systems in general. this issue was also raised by  <cit> .

possible improvements to the example model
major areas of possible improvement to the example model include addressing many of the assumptions and simplifications , improving calibration , adding cell-cycle checkpoints, incorporating membrane receptors and growth-factor and adhesion-factor pathways, and adding chromatin manipulations during dna replication  <cit>  and m phase. some preliminary work has indicated that these improvements are not inconsistent with the model or the framework.

CONCLUSIONS
a framework for modeling complex cell-biologic pathways is described here. the framework includes a description of the entire lifecycles of the modeled molecules, combined with a description of the basic cellular machinery. these constructs foster completeness and rigor--qualities that will be necessary as biological models grow in scope and detail. the framework is applied to a model of the growth and division of mammalian cells. the example model has been exercised and found to generate non-trivial descriptions of the cell cycle, some of which could be worthy of experimental confirmation.
