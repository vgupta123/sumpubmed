BACKGROUND
ets transcription factors are highly conserved proteins that have a unique  <dig> amino acid dna-binding domain. ets proteins activate or repress the expression of a myriad of genes that are involved in various biological processes, including cellular proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and transformation <cit> . typically, ets proteins directly bind to regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers that contain a ggaa/t core sequence motif thereby regulating target gene expression. this protein family consists of 25- <dig> members in mammals, which are broadly expressed in a variety of tissues and their relative expression differs according to cell type. this poses a challenging task of determining which of these ets proteins are biologically active in a given cellular environment and to link a specific ets protein to its target.

the mammary epithelium and cell lines derived from mammary tissues and tumors express a number of ets factors <cit> . the critical function of some of these ets factors in mammary gland development, differentiation and tumorigenesis is dramatically reflected in the phenotypes observed in transgenic and knockout mouse studies <cit> . one such ets factor is elf <dig> , which is highly restricted to tissues and organs rich in glandular or secretory epithelial cells including the mammary luminal epithelium <cit> . the first hint as to the functional importance of elf <dig> in mammary gland development came from studies showing that elf <dig> heterozygous female mice display impaired mammary alveolar morphogenesis <cit> . however, the fact that elf5-null mice die very early during embryogenesis due to developmental defects in the formation of extraembryonic ectoderm limited further studies <cit> . to overcome this, we and others have investigated the effects of the complete loss of elf <dig> using tissue-specific knockout models and mammary transplants <cit> . mammary glands that are deficient in elf <dig> completely fail to initiate alveologenesis during pregnancy and retain characteristics of virgin ductal epithelial cells. furthermore, elf5-null mammary glands accumulate cd61+ luminal progenitor cells supporting a critical role for elf <dig> in specifying the differentiation of mammary epithelial progenitors to establish secretory alveolar lineage <cit> . our studies have also shown that elf <dig> transcriptionally regulates the expression of key mediators of the prolactin/jak2/stat <dig> signaling pathway, and alterations in this pathway might be partly responsible for the elf5-null mammary gland phenotype <cit> . these studies have unearthed a wealth of information about the biological role of elf <dig> in mammary gland development and established elf <dig> as a critical transcription factor that dictates cell fate and lineage choices.

while the importance of elf <dig> in normal mammary gland development is firmly established, whether it acts as a tumor suppressor or an oncogene in breast tumorigenesis remains to be determined. interestingly, elf <dig> is localized to human chromosome 11p13- <dig>  a region of the genome, which undergoes loss of heterozygosity  in many types of cancer, including ductal carcinoma of the breast <cit> . preliminary studies have demonstrated that loss of elf <dig> is frequently found in human mammary carcinoma cells and elf <dig> mrna expression also is lost in a number of breast cancers compared to adjacent normal tissues <cit> . these observations are in agreement with a recent study on mmtv-wnt- <dig> murine breast tumors, which showed that elf <dig> expression was significantly diminished in the tumorigenic compartment <cit> . however these results are in contrast to expression analysis studies of breast cancer by other laboratories, which have suggested increased elf <dig> expression in breast cancer <cit> . notwithstanding the lack of a clear-cut role of elf <dig> in tumor development, it is safe to posit that this transcription factor is an important mediator of various facets of mammary gland biology and warrants further experimental studies. identification of the repertoire of its target genes is one such critical step in better understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying elf <dig> function.

our biochemical studies have demonstrated that the ets domain of elf <dig> acts as a transcriptional repressor, whereas the n-terminal pointed domain can function as a transcriptional activator <cit> . these observations fit well with studies on some putative elf5-target promoters such as psa, sprr2a, keratin  <dig>  and wap promoters, which have shown that elf <dig> can activate or repress transcription in a context-dependent manner <cit> . however, a global analysis of elf5-binding events is lacking, and our current knowledge of what are bona-fide elf5-targets is extrapolated from a limited number of examples that have been obtained from in vitro binding studies and reporter assays in keratinocytes. to overcome this shortcoming, here we have applied a chromatin immunoprecipitation -cloning strategy with validated chip-grade anti-elf <dig> antibodies to identify genetic loci bound by elf <dig> in mammary epithelium. our studies have identified numerous physiologically relevant downstream targets of elf <dig> including several of known significance in the development and function of mammary glands. as a proof of principle to demonstrate the validity of our approach and to further elucidate the role of elf <dig> in mammary glands, we have focused our studies on ccnd <dig> . we show that elf <dig> binds to a conserved site within an upstream regulatory element as well as the proximal promoter of the ccnd <dig> gene and that the expression level of cyclin d <dig> is upregulated by the loss of elf <dig> in mammary epithelial cells in culture as well as in elf <dig> deficient mammary glands. collectively our chip approach has identified numerous mouse target genes of elf <dig> and has offered insight into the regulatory pathways controlled by elf <dig> during mammary gland morphogenesis and cancer.

RESULTS
assessing the efficacy of elf5-antibodies for chromatin immunoprecipitation
although the commonly used commercial elf <dig> antibody  shows robust activity in detecting the endogenous protein by both western blot and immunostaining and has been used sporadically for chip experiments, its efficiency in immunoprecipitating endogenous elf <dig> has not been experimentally determined. hence, we took advantage of a recently described gal4-based cell culture system to test the efficacy of anti-elf <dig> antibodies <cit> . hek <dig> uas-tk-luc is a human cell line with a gal4-responsive luciferase gene integrated into the genome. our goal was to test if the n- <dig> antibodies are capable of recognizing its specific epitopes under harsh conditions, those typically associated with chip experiments such as formaldehyde crosslinking and stringent washing. this also allowed us to assess how well the n- <dig> antibodies fare, when compared to chip-grade antibodies against another dna-binding protein such as gal <dig>  for this purpose, we transfected the hek <dig> uas-tk-luc cell line with plasmids expressing either the gal <dig> dna binding domain or a chimeric protein consisting of gal <dig> dna binding fused to elf <dig> and confirmed the expression of the proteins by western blot analysis with anti-gal <dig> and anti-elf <dig> antibodies . the transfected cells were then subjected to chip using antibodies against gal <dig> and elf <dig>  when pcr was performed with chiped dna for the gal4-responsive uas region, as expected, a significant enrichment was observed specifically with anti-gal <dig> antibodies in cells transfected with plasmids encoding gal <dig> dna binding . on the other hand, in cells transfected with gal <dig> dbd-elf <dig>  enrichment was obtained when using both the gal <dig> and elf <dig> antibodies. this enrichment was specific, since control lanes  did not show any pcr products and only background levels of products were obtained in untransfected cells. interestingly, under these conditions, the elf <dig> antibodies performed as well as, if not better than the gal <dig> antibodies, confirming its usefulness for chip experiments to detect genomic targets. one potential caveat however is the fact that this experiment was performed on gal4-elf <dig> fusion protein, and the presence of gal <dig> dna binding domain might influence the overall conformation and accessibility of the epitope. thus it is conceivable that the n- <dig> antibodies may be more  competent and specific in immunoprecipitating endogenous elf <dig> 

chromatin immunoprecipitation of mammary epithelium with anti-elf <dig> antibodies and cloning of elf5-bound genomic segments
having established that the n- <dig> anti-elf <dig> antibodies are well suited for chip experiments, we next decided to identify the in vivo target genes of elf <dig> in mouse mammary glands obtained from  <dig>  days of pregnancy. importantly, elf <dig> is highly expressed during this stage of alveolar maturation and knockout studies have clearly demonstrated an indispensable role for this transcription factor in alveologenesis. using the n- <dig> antibodies, we prepared a library of chromatin-dna immunoprecipitated from mammary glands. to overcome the technical challenge associated with limiting amounts of dna obtained during the chip procedure, we utilized a ligation-mediated pcr technique, a method successfully used by our laboratory in prior studies  <cit> . in addition, to reduce non-specific dna contamination, we purified the pcr-amplified fragments by incubation with agarose beads containing gst-elf <dig> protein. this enrichment procedure allowed us to select for dna fragments that are more likely to contain dna binding-sites for elf <dig>  using this strategy, we isolated and sequenced  <dig> clones. of the  <dig> sequenced clones, we found that there were  <dig> duplicate sequences, and  <dig> could not be mapped to a specific location in the mouse genome. this resulted in a final  <dig> unique mouse clones, which were analyzed by mapping them to the mouse genome database by using a variety of search programs including the university of california santa cruz genome browser, ensembl, or the blast program at ncbi. this allowed us to determine the location of the elf5-immunoprecipitated dna fragments in relation to known or predicted genes.

our study revealed that  <dig> dna fragments out of the  <dig> unique clones immunoprecipitated by anti-elf <dig> antibodies were embedded within or located near known, annotated, or predicted genes. we chose to assign the dna fragments to a specific gene if the sequence matched to the intragenic region or a segment within  <dig> kb upstream or downstream. the  <dig> gene-associated elf5-binding fragments identified by this approach are listed in table  <dig>  with their genomic coordinates. the remaining  <dig> fragments that did not map to genomic regions close to any gene may represent distal enhancers involved in regulating gene expression from distances significantly farther than  <dig> kb, a characteristic found in some enhancers. alternatively, these segments may denote non-annotated regions of the genome that do not encode for conventional genes but are sites for mirna and similar elements. some of these elements may also represent experimental artifacts resulting from non-specific dna-binding of elf <dig> to certain chromatin regions that are captured during formaldehyde cross-linking or contaminating dna obtained during the immunoprecipitation or pcr enrichment steps.

characteristic features of the elf <dig> target regions
examination of the  <dig> elf <dig> occupied target fragments revealed several interesting findings. forty five percent of the elf5-chip fragments were located within an intron of known or predicted genes, with a large proportion of them in the first intron . a majority of the dna fragments chromatin immunoprecipitated by elf <dig> was located within a region spanning 100-kb upstream or downstream of candidate target genes. this observation is in agreement with many other transcription factors such as gata- <dig>  foxa <dig>  tcf <dig> for which genomic binding sites have been deciphered on a large scale and reflects the growing evidence for the presence of intragenic and distant extragenic cis-regulatory regions for transcriptional control <cit> . although several sites were located less than 10-kb upstream of a transcription start site , only a small number mapped to the promoter proximal regions. this may reflect the propensity of elf <dig> to act primarily through distal enhancers or simply signify under-representation of promoter regions since they are not well defined and properly annotated for many mouse genes.

interestingly, some elf5-chiped dna fragments were located in between two genes. in these cases, although we have only chosen the nearest located gene as a potential elf5-regulatable gene for subsequent analysis, it is possible the distally located gene may be the actual elf5-target. for example, one of the immunoprecipitated dna fragments mapped to a region that is upstream of the elf <dig> gene itself suggesting this region could function as an enhancer for elf <dig>  this is of particular interest given the propensity of many transcription factors to auto-regulate themselves through dna-binding elements located in their regulatory regions. however, the elf <dig> gene lies close to a family member ehf  in a head-to-tail orientation. due to this close proximity, the elf5-chiped fragment maps to a region ~ <dig> kb away from elf <dig> and ~ <dig> kb from ehf. in view of the overlapping expression pattern and similar biological role of elf <dig> and ehf in epithelial development, it is quite possible that the elf5-response element located in the intergenic region may coordinately regulate the expression of both these genes.

elf5-target sites are broadly located on all mouse chromosomes, suggesting a broad and unbiased distribution across the mouse genome . functional classification of these potential targets based on gene ontology categorization revealed that these are widely distributed among a wide variety of categories including transcriptional regulation, signaling cascades and metabolism . the diverse nature of the targets identified in our study reinforces the notion that elf <dig> plays a role in complex biological pathways that affect a wide variety of cellular processes. given the proposed role of elf <dig> in regulating the gene expression of milk proteins during alveologenesis, we were surprised that no such gene was found in our chip data. since by some estimates, transcription factors are thought to bind to ~thousands of genomic sites, the absence of any milk protein genes in our elf <dig> target list could be due to the small sample size.

we next searched chip-identified sequences of the  <dig> identified targets to find dna-binding motifs that may be indicative of elf <dig> binding sites. previous studies have attempted to define the consensus elf <dig> dna binding site based on gelshift binding assays and in vitro selection experiments. although these studies have revealed slightly different consensus sites for elf <dig> such as 5'-ggaannc-3'  <cit>  and 5'-ancaggaagtan-3'  <cit>  and 5'-ggaannc-3'  <cit>  - they all contain the invariant ggaa core sequence, but differing flanking sequence. hence, we searched the  <dig> elf5-chiped segments in a biased manner using the ggaa position weight matrix  as a query for the pattern-recognition program patser. this analysis showed that the ggaa core motif is highly enriched within chip-identified elf <dig> target regions. indeed, at least one ggaa motif was identified in all chip-cloned fragments, whereas several dna segments with multiple ggaa elements were identified by the patser program with e-value cutoff - <dig>  these numbers were lower when a more stringent e-value cut off of - <dig> was used, however the trend remained the same. the consensus dna-binding site for elf <dig> based on the chiped genomic sequence is quite similar to that previously described as shown in the weblogo generated from our current data . the fact that many of the potential elf5-binding sites identified by chip were highly conserved support the notion that these sites are likely to be functionally relevant .

confirmation of a subset of elf <dig> target genes by independent chip assays and their expression levels in the absence of elf5
to facilitate further studies of the potential elf <dig> targets, we selected thirteen genomic loci identified by chip. these dna fragments immunoprecipitated by elf <dig> were chosen to represent the wide range of distinct characteristics such as potential function of the target genes, different locations relative to the target genes , and whether the elf5-binding segments were close to one or more target genes . however given the importance of elf <dig> to mammary gland development and differentiation, we focused on a few genes that were transcription factors  or key members of signaling pathways  that are relevant to mammary gland biology. for these experiments, cross-linked chromatin from mouse mammary glands was immunoprecipitated in two independent experiments with anti-elf <dig> antibodies and the co-precipitation of the elf5-response elements was ascertained by pcr with primers that amplify the chosen thirteen fragments. as a negative control we utilized a genomic segment corresponding to a segment of the gapdh gene. as shown in fig  <dig>  after immunoprecipitation of cross-linked chromatin we found that there was specific enrichment of all potential elf5-response elements, but not gapdh with antibodies against elf <dig> compared to igg or no antibody control. although for most of the genomic fragments, the extent of specific amplification that was observed was robust, in a few cases the pcr product was only marginally stronger than the control suggesting that there is a great deal of variability in the extent of recruitment of elf <dig> to these sites. this might reflect the strength and number of elf5-binding sites, presence of additional transcription factor binding to these regions and/or specific regulatory events that are dictated by the differentiation state of the mammary epithelial cells.

next we performed real time rt-pcr experiments to test if genes associated with the thirteen genomic loci were indeed expressed in mammary glands and if their expression levels were altered in the absence of elf <dig>  we have previously shown that mammary epithelium-specific conditional deletion of elf <dig> leads to a complete block in alveologenesis during lactation. given the strong expression of elf <dig> in mammary glands at  <dig>  day of pregnancy and the dramatic phenotype observed in lactating day  <dig>  these two time frames were chosen for further studies. we isolated rna from mammary glands from k14-cre/elf5f/f animals and their wt littermate controls . the real time pcr data revealed that majority of the genes showed significant differences in their level of expression in elf5-null mammary glands compared to wild type controls . interestingly, of the several candidate genes chosen, two of them, dlx <dig> and tbx <dig> showed no detectable expression in mammary glands under our experimental conditions. it is possible that the elf5-chiped fragment located close to the dlx <dig> gene might alternatively be involved in regulating the metapl <dig> gene, situated on the 3' end . on the other hand, the complete lack of expression of tbx <dig> in mammary gland is more puzzling and raises the possibility that the corresponding genomic fragment obtained in our screen is perhaps non-functional, representing either fortuitous binding or an experimental artifact. one interesting aspect of these studies is that majority of the genes that were examined showed up regulation in the absence of elf <dig>  this suggests that elf <dig> may act broadly as a transcriptional repressor, a property that we had observed in our previous biochemical experiments <cit> . another aspect that caught our attention is that many of the potential elf <dig> target genes are myoepithelial/basal restricted . this might reflect a propensity for elf <dig> to suppress myoepithelial gene expression and foster a luminal cell fate.

identification of ccnd <dig> as a direct elf <dig> target
having shown that our strategy for finding elf5-targets was successful, we decided to focus on one putative target gene ccnd <dig>  for further detailed examination. this was prompted by several observations including a prior study that demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing high levels of cyclin d <dig> under the mmtv promoter exhibit a lack of alveologenesis and a failure to lactate - a phenotype that mimics that of the elf <dig> knockouts <cit> . furthermore, the elf <dig> chiped fragment corresponded to an evolutionarily conserved dna segment ~ <dig> kb upstream of the mouse ccnd <dig> gene suggesting that this region was likely to play a functional role . the upstream segment contained two potential elf5-binding sites. we reasoned that if elf <dig> directly regulated the expression of ccnd <dig>  it was likely to also interact with the promoter region. a careful examination of the proximal promoter sequence revealed a consensus elf5-binding site at - <dig> to - <dig> upstream of the transcriptional start site .

we therefore probed if these potential elf5-binding sites were directly capable of interacting with elf <dig>  for this purpose, full-length elf <dig> protein was expressed in e. coli as a gst-fusion protein. in addition, we also generated elf <dig> gst-fusion proteins containing specific mutations in amino acids r <dig> and k <dig> located in the dna-binding domain. we reasoned that based on sequence conservation of the ets domain, these two amino acids are likely to be critical mediators of elf5-dna binding. for example, in case of the ets transcription factor, pdef, the ets domain makes a number of contacts with its dna substrate <cit> . one site of major interaction with bases occur at the conserved arginine residue r <dig>  which make key hydrogen bonds with the gga core, whereas a highly conserved lysine, k <dig>  is thought to be involved in the tethering of dna along with other residues to properly orient the dna molecule. these two residues of pdef are the counterparts of r <dig> and k <dig> in elf <dig> and hence likely to be important for dna-binding. the wildtype and mutant gst-elf <dig> proteins were purified to reasonable homogeneity  and tested for their ability to bind to oligonucleotides containing elf <dig> consensus dna-binding sequences by gelshift experiment. as expected, while wildtype gst-elf <dig> protein strongly bound to dna, the mutants completely failed .

we next generated oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the three elf5-consensus sequences. these probes were labeled to approximately the same level of specific activity and tested by gelshift assays with gst-elf <dig> and gst elf <dig> mutant proteins. as shown in fig. 4b, gst-elf <dig> showed strong binding to the promoter sequences of cyclin d <dig> whereas both mutants did not show any detectable binding. the dna-protein complex could be supershifted with two different antibodies against elf <dig> confirming the specificity of the complex . in a similar fashion, oligonucleotides containing two distinct elf5-consensus sites embedded within the cyclin d <dig> upstream element were also capable of forming complexes specifically with gst-elf <dig> but not with either of the mutants . interestingly, the dna-protein complex with both the oligonucleotides of the upstream element was relatively weaker as compared to the promoter region. this suggested that the promoter sequence likely corresponded to a high-affinity elf5-binding site and reaffirmed the notion that sequences flanking the core ggaa motif significantly influence binding activity as demonstrated before.

to clearly demonstrate that ccnd <dig> is a direct target gene of elf <dig> we performed an independent chip assay . we used anti-elf <dig> antibodies to immunoprecipitate crosslinked chromatin from mouse mammary tissue. we designed a set of primers  to amplify the putative cyclind <dig> upstream element identified in our screen and the proximal promoter region . as a control, we designed a set of primers  that amplify a random region of genomic segment 3' of the ccnd <dig> gene that did not show any sequence conservation. as shown by pcr data in fig. 4c, specific enrichment of the cyclin d <dig> 5' upstream and promoter region, but not the 3' downstream element was observed after immunoprecipitation with antibodies against elf <dig> as compared to the igg or no antibody control. this suggested that in vivo elf <dig> physically occupies the regulatory elements of the ccnd <dig> gene and given the presence of elf5-binding sites, we posit that this is a direct interaction.

having demonstrated that elf <dig> can directly bind to the cis elements of the ccnd <dig> gene, our next goal was to determine if the expression of this gene was transcriptionally responsive to elf <dig>  for this purpose we focused on the cyclind <dig> proximal promoter region, given the presence of a strong elf5-binding site in this segment. the mouse cyclind <dig> promoter was cloned into pgl3-basic vector and assayed for reporter activity. as a control, we generated a mutant pgl3-ccnd <dig> promoter where the core gga element of the elf5-binding site was mutated. we utilized mcf- <dig> cells for the transient transfection experiments since these cells have been shown to lack endogenous elf <dig> expression <cit> . when transfected in these cells, pgl3-ccnd <dig> promoter showed significant luciferase activity compared to the empty pgl <dig> vector suggesting that the promoter was active in these cells. next, the reporter plasmid was cotransfected with either an expression plasmid encoding for ha-tagged elf <dig>  ha-tagged elf <dig>  or an empty ha-control vector. the expression of the ha-tagged elf <dig> and ha-tagged elf <dig> proteins were confirmed by western blot analysis with anti-ha antibodies . as demonstrated in fig. 4d, expression of both elf <dig> and elf <dig> resulted in decreased levels of reporter activity, although the effects of elf <dig> were clearly more pronounced . this repressive effect of elf <dig> was significantly, although not completely, relieved when the pgl3-ccnd <dig> promoter containing the mutant elf5-binding site was utilized under the same conditions. this data suggests that elf <dig> can act as a repressor and inhibit the activity of the proximal mouse cyclind <dig> promoter.

expression pattern of elf <dig> and cyclin d <dig> in mouse mammary glands
the expression pattern of cyclin d <dig> in mammary glands is quite dynamic. in one study, it was reported that cyclin d <dig> was not easily detectable in mammary glands at any stages of development as measured by western blot analysis <cit> . however, immunostaining data suggested that in virgin glands, cyclind <dig> protein was localized predominantly in the myoepithelial cells. on the other hand, cyclind <dig> was reported to be expressed in both myoepithelial and luminal epithelial cells at the rna level in normal human breast samples <cit> . given this discrepancy, we decided to re-examine the expression profile of cyclin d <dig> using data from a microarray analysis that was performed on mammary glands obtained at different stages of development spanning the virgin state to involution <cit> . the expression profile shown in fig 5a clearly demonstrate a dynamic expression of cyclin d <dig> with a steady level throughout the virgin stages and early pregnancy but then dramatic reduction at mid pregnancy. during the same period, elf <dig> showed an opposite pattern with low expression levels during virgin stages and early pregnancy and a progressive surge in expression from p <dig>  onwards that coincided with the downregulation of cyclin d <dig>  this reciprocal mode of expression is further suggestive of elf5's role as a potential repressor keeping cyclin d <dig> expression in check.

if elf <dig> is an important transcriptional regulator of cyclin d <dig>  we hypothesized that in its absence; there will be changes in the expression of cyclin d <dig>  to test this, we isolated total rna from wild type control and elf5-null mammary glands, generated cdnas and performed real time pcr. while in p <dig>  mammary glands, the expression of cyclin d <dig> was modestly higher in elf <dig> knockout, by lactation day  <dig>  this difference was significantly more pronounced . to examine if these changes in transcript also correlated with protein level, we performed western blot analysis with mammary gland extracts. in agreement with mrna levels, cyclin d <dig> protein was upregulated in the samples from lactation day  <dig> in elf5-null mammary glands compared to wildtype control . we also examined the expression of p27kip <dig>  a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor shown to be important in activation of cyclin d-cdk <dig> complexes <cit> . indeed, in the mmtv-cyclin d <dig> overexpressing mice, the mammary gland phenotype has been attributed in part to increased p27kip <dig> protein levels <cit> . however, the interactions between these cell cycle regulators are likely to be complex and context dependent. for example, cell culture based studies have shown that overexpression of cyclin d <dig> affect the translocation of p <dig> from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and promotes its degradation <cit> . western blot analysis showed that although there was a modest reduction in protein levels of p27kip <dig> in p <dig>  mammary glands in the absence of elf <dig>  the expression was restored to normal levels in lactating animals. the significance of this alteration in p <dig> levels is currently unknown and worth future investigation.

expression of ccnd <dig> in the absence of elf5
to determine the transcriptional effects of elf <dig> on ccnd <dig> in a more physiological setting, we decided to examine mammary epithelial cells  isolated from elf <dig> conditional knockout  animals. we have previously shown <cit>  that in these mecs, elf <dig> can be inactivated by expression of cre recombinase by using adenoviral vectors . mecs were harvested from elf5f/f mice and infected with either ad-cre or ad-gfp and cultured on basement membrane matrix for varying time points. as we have demonstrated before, infection of mecs with adenovirus expressing cre resulted in a significant knockdown of elf <dig> expression by  <dig> h after infection with virtually no detectable protein after  <dig> h. to examine cyclin d <dig> levels, protein lysates were harvested from mecs and western blots were performed. loss of elf <dig> leads to a strong increase in ccnd <dig> further supporting the notion that elf <dig> acts as a repressor of the ccnd <dig> gene .

to further probe the effects of loss of elf <dig> during pregnancy, we compared mammary glands from k14-cre/elf5f/f animals and their wildtype type littermate controls  by immunofluorescent staining with anti-ccnd <dig> antibodies. at p <dig> , in wt mammary glands, ccnd <dig> was predominantly restricted to the outer myoepithelial cells, where they showed a patchy expression pattern whereas no staining was detected in the luminal cells. in contrast, in elf5-null mammary glands, ccnd <dig> expression clearly extended into the luminal cells . the altered expression profile of ccnd <dig> was also observed in the p <dig>  day samples, where more luminal cells stained positive for ccnd <dig> in the collapsed ductal structures that are present in the elf5-null mammary glands. these results suggest that in normal luminal cells, elf <dig> keeps cyclin d <dig> expression in check and that in its absence, cyclin d <dig> is turned on in at least a subset of the luminal cells. it has been shown that in the absence of elf <dig>  there is decreased proliferation in the pregnant mammary glands <cit> . interestingly it was also shown that there is an increase in cd61+ luminal progenitors in the elf5-null mammary epithelium <cit> . we posit that the luminal cells with higher levels of cyclin d <dig> might represent a selective population of these luminal progenitor cells, which possess a higher proliferative potential.

CONCLUSIONS
the identification of ccnd <dig> as a direct target of elf <dig> is a novel finding and has implications for the proliferative decisions of mammary epithelial cells during normal development as well as in cancer. in this context, it is also interesting to note that a closer examination of the recently generated microarray analysis of sorted mammary stem/progenitor cell populations reveal that in both the human mammary stem cell  and bipotent progenitor cell populations , ccnd <dig> is one of the most highly expressed transcript <cit> . this is particularly important since our preliminary studies suggest that loss of elf <dig> during pregnancy leads to increase in stem and progenitor cell population . although in this study we demonstrate elf <dig> as one transcription factor that keeps cyclin d <dig> repressed, this important cell cycle regulator is likely to be controlled by additional transcription factors. indeed there is published data linking stat <dig>  sp <dig>  myc and gata <dig> to the transcriptional regulation of cyclin d <dig> in a variety of cell types including immune cells and cardiomyocytes <cit> . of these, the stat <dig> connection is potentially the most interesting, given the crosstalk between stat <dig> and elf <dig> in the prolactin mediated signaling pathway in mammary glands and hence warrants further investigation <cit> . the availability of a set of genomic targets of elf <dig> in mammary glands serves as a valuable tool for probing the molecular function of this transcription factor in mammary gland biology and has now set the stage for a rigorous global examination of the elf5-regulated transcriptome by next generation sequencing.
