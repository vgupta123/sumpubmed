BACKGROUND
in vitro embryo production depends on the collection of immature oocytes from heterogeneous follicular population of slaughterhouse ovaries. despite the desire to expand the field application of this technology in cattle, the blastocyst development is limited to 30–40% with only half of these being able to initiate a successful pregnancy following transfer  <cit> . one of the main factors affecting the embryo yield is the intrinsic quality of the oocyte, while the embryo culture condition plays a crucial role in determining embryo quality  <cit> .

there is a general agreement that oocyte developmental competence is related to follicule size  <cit> , estrous cycle stage  <cit>  and the level of atresia influenced by other follicles, mainly the dominant follicle  <cit>  and morphological features of the oocyte  <cit> . follicle size and oocyte diameter are closely related, and as both increase the developmental potential of the oocyte also increases  <cit> . however, various studies revealed that the developmental competence of an oocyte is related to the status of the follicle from which it is obtained regardless of follicle size  <cit> .

as soon as the primordial follicle store is established, follicle recruitment begins and continues in a wave-like pattern during estrous cycles. bovine estrous cycle is characterized by a series of two or three follicular waves  <cit> . within several days of initiation of a wave, one follicle is selected as the dominant follicle, which continues to grow and differentiate, whereas its sister subordinate follicles plateau in growth and then regress. the interactions between the follicles throughout each follicular wave affect oocyte quality. it was reported  <cit>  that development of early embryos to the blastocyst stage was greater when oocytes are obtained during follicular growth/stagnation phase  than in the dominance/regression phase . the dominant follicle exerts a direct inhibitory effect on the development of subordinate follicles  <cit> , causing them to undergo atresia  <cit> , which lead to lower in vitro developmental competence compared to their counterparts at growth phase  <cit> . in addition, blastocysts derived from oocytes collected from both medium and small follicles at g/s stage or d/r stage were reported to be different in relative abundance of transcripts related to embryonic development  <cit> .

to our knowledge, the mrna transcript abundance of oocytes recovered at different stages of ovarian follicular turnover in bovine has not yet been analyzed. therefore, in the present study we aimed to identify the differences in the transcript abundance of bovine oocytes retrieved from small follicles at growth and dominance phases which could be associated with oocyte developmental potential. with this approach, we have identified differentially expressed genes in oocytes derived from these two stages. differences in transcript abundance of some transcripts of interest between the two oocyte groups and cumulus cells were examined using quantitative real-time pcr. an independent model has been used to validate the expression profile of some selected transcripts in oocytes screened for differences in their developmental competence.

in addition, msx <dig> gene was selected for further analysis due to the following reasons: 1) it has also been identified as differentially regulated transcript between biopsies derived from blastocysts resulted in pregnancy and no pregnancy in our previous study  <cit>  2) results from previous studies  <cit>  suggest a physiologically optimal level of msx <dig> expression is vital for normal cellular function. however, so far this transcript has not been characterized in early embryonic development and follicular turnover. the distribution of protein products and mrna for msx <dig> during ovarian follicular turnover and early embryonic development has been evidenced in this study.

RESULTS
follicle distribution and oocyte recovery
as shown in table  <dig>  ultrasound guided ovum pick up  of sixty cyclic heifers showed that ovaries of both growth and dominance phases had greater number of small follicles  than medium and large follicles. moreover, a higher number of small and medium follicles  has been found at growth phase compared to dominance phase . consequently, the average number of oocytes collected per cow was greater during growth phase  than in the dominance phase .

comparative transcript abundance of oocytes recovered at growth and dominance phases
in the present study, a series of six hybridizations  were conducted to minimize the false positive expression changes and to identify genes truly differentially expressed between oocytes recovered from growth and dominance phases. the generated data are available on our website of bonn university  <cit> , under the research section for opu-ivf. after lowess normalization of the data, log value of cy <dig> total intensity was compared with the log value of cy <dig> total intensity for both the target  and the respective dye swap hybridizations . the coefficient of determination of the target  and dye swap  hybridizations were found to be relatively the same which confirms that there was low false positive expression changes between hybridizations of differentially labeled  cdna from the same phase .

to obtain a highly confident set of differentially expressed genes, we used a rigorous combination of p-value  and fold discovery rate  of 10%. accordingly, the data analysis performed by sam showed that  <dig> transcripts were differentially regulated between the two oocyte populations. the threshold for significant variation was set at  <dig>  fold change. using this criterion, genes were sorted into two categories based on their variation factor: those for which the relative transcript abundance increased  or decreased  in growth phase versus dominance phase oocytes. the fold change was in a range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  for up-regulated and  <dig>  to  <dig>  for down-regulated genes in growth phase compared to dominance phase oocytes .

differentially expressed genes were identified by sam at a false discovery rate  of ≤ 10% and p <  <dig> .

differentially expressed genes were identified by sam at a false discovery rate  of ≤ 10% and p <  <dig> .

hierarchical clustering and heatmap of differentially regulated genes showed the overall expression pattern between the two oocyte groups. the average linkage clustering analysis revealed the presence of many subgroups  within the up- and down-regulated genes sharing similar expression pattern .

functional classification of differentially regulated genes
all differentially regulated transcripts were functionally classified based on the criteria of gene ontology consortium classifications  <cit> . the resulting data were supplemented with additional information from various tools available in national center for biotechnology information  <cit> . accordingly, the differentially regulated transcripts represent genes with known function , genes with unknown function  and novel transcripts  . regarding the molecular function, transcripts with known function showed to be involved in protein biosynthesis , transcription , cytoskeleton , cell cycle , nadh dehydrogenase activity , calcium ion binding , nucleotide binding  and other functions . oocytes recovered at growth phase  were enriched with genes regulating protein biosynthesis , translation elongation , atp binding , nadh dehydrogenase activity , cytoskeleton , calcium ion binding , signal transduction , inorganic diphosphatase  and thiol-disulfide exchange intermediate . on the other hand, oocytes recovered at dominance phase  were encoded transcripts controlling transcription , cell cycle , aldehyde reductase activity , nucleotide binding , growth factor  and fertilization .

real-time pcr validation
real-time pcr analysis using independent oocyte samples was conducted to validate the array results of  <dig> differentially regulated transcripts. no differences in relative abundance of the internal control gene  were observed in all samples. based on this, the quantitative real-time pcr has confirmed the relative abundance of  <dig> transcripts  to be in agreement with microarray results . the mrna relative abundance of mrnas for anaxa <dig>  s100a <dig>  rpl <dig>  and pp was higher  in growth phase compared to dominance phase oocytes. greater transcript abundance for msx <dig> and bmb <dig> was observed in dominance phase versus growth phase oocytes. however, differences in transcript abundance of fl <dig> and pttg <dig> between the two oocyte groups were not statistically significant. the array results of cks <dig> and ccnb <dig> could not be confirmed by real-time quantitative pcr .

quantitative analysis of selected transcripts in cumulus cells
to avoid any biasness in the number of cumulus cells used as an input for mrna isolation and subsequent real-time pcr, cumulus cells were derived from equal number of cumulus oocyte complexes  with similar morphological appearance. after mrna isolation and subsequent cdna synthesis, the relative abundance of gapdh gene was tested and showed no variation between these samples. two transcripts  were highly abundant  in cumulus cells of dominance phase than that of growth phase . on the other hand, rpl <dig> and cks <dig> transcripts were found to be more abundant in cumulus cells of growth phase compared to that of dominance phase. the relative abundance of mrna for s100a <dig> was nearly the same in cumulus cells of both phases.

validation of relationship between transcript abundance and oocyte competence using bcb staining
immature oocytes screened for developmental competence based on bcb staining were used for validation of the expression profile of five transcripts . the cdna synthesized from bcb+  and bcb-  oocyte samples were quantified using real-time pcr. after confirming that there were no significant differences in the relative abundance of gapdh between the samples, all transcripts were quantified using independent real-time pcr runs. the relative abundance for msx <dig> and pttg <dig> were higher  in bcb- oocytes than bcb+ ones . the bmp <dig> was also more abundant in bcb- than bcb+ oocytes but differences were not significant. on the other hand, greater mrna abundance  for rpl <dig> and pp has been observed in bcb+ than bcb- oocytes .

localization of bovine msx <dig> mrna and protein
immunofluorescent labelling of msx <dig> gene in ovarian samples collected at the time of estrus , ovulation , growth phase  and dominance phase  showed the presence of this protein in all stages of follicular development under investigation. more specifically, this protein was found to be more localized in the oocyte cytoplasm than the enclosed cumulus cells  or other cellular layers of the growing follicle  at all stages of follicular development except at growth phase . furthermore, msx <dig> protein was found to be dispersed in the cytoplasm of immature and matured oocytes and early zygote  but tends to be localized around the nucleus at advanced zygote, 2-cell, 4-cell and 8-cell embryos . comparative analysis of protein signals between oocytes showed that green fluorescence signals were reduced after maturation . moreover, in situ hybridization experiment showed that msx <dig> mrna was localized in the oocytes, cumulus cells and follicular wall throughout all stages of follicular turnover .

discussion
investigation on the molecular characteristics of oocytes of varying developmental competence is critical for the development of future classification criteria for the selection of oocytes with superior developmental capacity  <cit> . it has been shown that the molecular causes for poor developmental capacity of bovine oocytes may be highly complex and may be reliant on many small changes in the rna levels of many genes  <cit> . however; our understanding of composition of the oocyte transcriptome and the identity of key oocyte-expressed genes with important regulatory roles in folliculogenesis and early embryonic development is far from complete  <cit> . thus, our study mainly focuses on identifications of differences in mrna transcript abundance which may be associated with developmental competence of bovine oocytes using cdna microarray as a functional genomics approach.

growing oocytes have higher rate of transcription and translation resulting in the formation of rnas and proteins both for oocyte growth and storage  <cit> . the previous molecules could be redirected to fulfil new tasks as resumption of meiosis  <cit>  and regulating maternal to zygotic transition  <cit> . developmental competence of mammalian oocytes depends on high rates of rna and protein synthesis, imprinting processes and biogenesis of organelles such as mitochondria  <cit> . similarly, in the present study oocytes from the growth phase were found to be enriched with transcripts related to protein biosynthesis as compared to their dominance phase counterparts. an adequate pool of ribosomes, which were synthesized by transcription of the ribosomal rna  genes, is required for protein synthesis during oocyte growth and embryonic development. failure to detect one or all of ribosomal rna  genes during oocyte growth or later during interphase of the first cell cycle is an indicator of developmental incompetence  <cit> . this is in agreement with our results that showed the down-regulation of rpl <dig> transcript in oocytes from dominance phase with low developmental potential and could be validated using bcb screened oocytes. this may suggest that there is an optimal threshold of mrna transcript abundance for ribosomal rna genes below which the developmental competence of the oocytes is compromised.

various transcription factors are known to be present in the maternal mrna store until their recruitment for translation at the time of maternal-embryonic transition  <cit> . in the present study, different transcription factors  were found to be up-regulated in dominance phase compared to growth phase oocytes. msx gene families encode homeodomain transcription factors  <cit>  and their protein products control key developmental processes such as differentiation and patterning during early development  <cit> . overexpression of the msx <dig> suppresses cell growth and cell cycle progression in human ovarian cancer cell line by regulating the expression of key cell cycle regulators  <cit> . in addition, msx <dig> has been reported to regulate the p <dig> tumor suppressor protein in human tumours and thereby enhances apoptosis mediated suppression of p <dig>  <cit> . moreover, mice msx <dig> homozygous mutants die at birth  <cit> . in a recent study, msx <dig> was more abundant in oocytes with reduced development competence  <cit> .

pituitary tumor transforming gene  was isolated from a pituitary tumor cell line and its over-expression results in cellular transformation in vitro and tumor formation in nude mice  <cit> . moreover, this gene stimulates expression of the bax gene, which induces apoptosis in human embryonic kidney cell line  <cit> . consistent with the previous facts, the enrichment of dominance phase oocytes with apoptotic related genes  may be related to the level of atresia in subordinate follicles as influenced by the dominant follicle which may lead to reduced developmental capacity of enclosed oocytes. in a recent study conducted in our laboratory, msx <dig> and pttg <dig> were found to be up-regulated in embryo biopsies derived from blastocysts which resulted in no pregnancy after transfer to recipients  <cit> .

optimal expression of msx <dig> as transcription factor seems to be important for cellular physiology  <cit> . in the present study, the msx <dig> protein was detected in all follicular compartments of the growing follicle at different stages of follicular turnover and early preimplantation stages, with a slight decrease in fluorescent intensity in ovaries at growth phase. as embryonic development proceeds there is accumulation of the msx <dig> protein around the nucleus of the blastomeres which is consistent with the localization of homeobox gene family namely cdx <dig> in mouse embryos  <cit> . furthermore, mrna for msx <dig> was also distributed in all follicular layers with intensive signal in the oocytes. as a member of transcription factor gene, the possible role of msx <dig> in regulating follicular turnover and early embryonic development needs further investigations.

oocyte growth during folliculogenesis is regulated by granulosa cell derived proteins  <cit> , which are in turn regulated by oocyte-derived factors  <cit> . in addition, cumulus cells provide nutrients for the oocyte and influence oocyte development in a paracrine fashion  <cit> , and these paracrine factors contribute to induce meiotic resumption of oocytes  <cit> . characterization of the signalling pathways driving changes in transcript abundance for co-regulated and differentially regulated genes in oocytes versus associated cumulus cells may lead to a better understanding of interdependent gene regulation between germ and somatic cells  <cit> . in this study, compared to other candidate transcripts the bovine msx <dig> was found to be higher in both oocytes and the corresponding cumulus cells at dominance phase than those from growth phase. therefore, this transcript can be considered as one of the factors activated in oocyte and cumulus cells from the subordinate follicles due to the presence of the dominant follicle. similar studies  <cit>  have described the expression profile of some transcripts  in the cumulus cells as potential markers of the quality of the enclosed oocyte.

the bcb staining was used effectively to select bovine oocytes for further developmental competence after in vitro fertilization  <cit>  or somatic cell nuclear transfer  <cit> . therefore, in the present study, bcb staining was used as an independent model to screen oocytes for their developmental competence in order to validate the differential expression of candidate genes identified in array analysis. higher abundance of msx <dig> and pttg <dig> in dominance phase oocytes in array experiment was consistent with their higher abundant in bcb- oocytes than in bcb+ ones. similarly, the relatively higher abundance of rpl <dig> and pp transcripts in oocytes from growth phase was consistent with their higher abundance in bcb+ oocytes. thus, there is a clear association of mrna abundance for genes detected in microarray experiment and developmental competence of oocyte tested with bcb staining. the bovine rpl <dig> and msx <dig> as members of ribosomal proteins and transcription factor gene family, respectively can be considered as good markers of oocyte developmental competence, as they showed consistent results in both models.

CONCLUSIONS
the reported differences in developmental competence of bovine oocytes derived from small follicles at growth and dominance phases of follicular development are also accompanied by differences in the relative abundance of transcripts related to the various molecular events and processes regulating oocyte competence and follicular development. our validation with an independent model for the relative abundance of some selected transcripts, supports the notion that many of the transcripts identified as differentially regulated and described here may represent marker candidate genes for oocyte developmental competence. however, the exact role of these transcripts in controlling oocyte developmental potential needs further investigation.
