BACKGROUND
comparative genomics is a powerful means for establishing relationships between gene function and location in a range of organisms. moreover it allows insight into large-scale genomic rearrangements, conservation of functional elements and tracing of evolutionary phylogenies through the examination of both closely and distantly related species. the completion of the chicken  genome  <cit>  and its associated resources provide the basis for the rapid development of detailed genomic information, potentially in all other birds. the most powerful strategies combine in-silico and experimental approaches, e.g. sequence comparison, cross-species fluorescent in-situ hybridization   <cit>  and, more recently, the use of whole-genome tiling path microarrays for cross-species array comparative genomic hybridization   <cit> . such a combination of modalities provides information on gross genomic rearrangements, gene gains/losses, copy number variation and gene order.

following the completion of the chicken genome sequence assembly  <cit> , one of the most obvious targets for comparative genomics in birds is the turkey . turkey is an agriculturally important species accounting for over  <dig>  million tonnes of meat consumed per year worldwide, with the obvious cultural associations such as christmas and thanksgiving. genetic mapping efforts in the turkey have focused on linkage mapping  <cit>  and the physical information available is very limited. with 2n =  <dig> in the chicken and 2n =  <dig> in the turkey, about  <dig> pairs of macro- and 28– <dig> pairs of microchromosomes in both species, the karyotypes of chicken and turkey are quite similar to the hypothetical ancestral galliform karyotype  <cit> . chromosome banding and zoo-fish with chromosome paints for chicken chromosomes gga1– <dig> and z in a range of galliform species have suggested that chicken and turkey karyotypes are distinguished by at least two interchromosomal rearrangements  <cit> . that is, the orthologues of chicken chromosomes gga <dig> and  <dig> are represented by turkey chromosomes mga <dig> &  <dig>  and  <dig> &  <dig> respectively  <cit> . comparisons of a series of other galliformes suggest that gga <dig> is the ancestral form . by contrast, the most parsimonious explanation for the formation of the sub-metacentric gga <dig> suggests a fusion of an ancestral acrocentric chromosome  <dig> with a smaller chromosome  <cit> . this fusion model is supported by sequence evidence which suggests that gga4p retains the properties  of the smaller chromosome it once was  <cit> . the chromosomal break- and fusion points involved in these rearrangements however have not been characterized in detail, nor has gene order on macrochromosomes; moreover no molecular evidence has yet been generated regarding synteny between microchromosomes though simple chromosome counts suggest extensive conservation.

to the best of our knowledge, no study has examined inter-specific differences in copy number variants  between birds. cnvs are defined as copy number changes involving dna fragments that are ~ <dig> kb or larger  <cit> , with the exception of insertions or deletions of transposable elements  <cit> . recent high-resolution, high-throughput techniques for genomic analysis such as array cgh and quantitative  pcr as well as in-silico approaches have revealed a significant contribution of cnvs to human genetic variation  <cit> , and studies in humans and other primates have suggested an important role for cnvs in disease-related as well as normal phenotypic variation  <cit>  and in evolutionary adaptation  <cit> . however, the paucity of data and the almost exclusive focus on primates preclude any general conclusions about the significance of cnvs in phenotypic variation and evolution; data from other species is therefore essential.

in this paper, by examination of chicken and turkey genomes for chromosomal and cnv differences we test the hypothesis that galliform genomes have remained relatively stable during ~ <dig> million years of evolution compared to an equivalent period in mammals. to date, this information has been limited to zoo-fish of chicken chromosome paints on other species and partial karyotypes but these early studies do suggest relative stability of the avian genome compared to the mammalian one. we thus present a detailed comparative cytogenetic map of the turkey based on reciprocal zoo-fish with chicken and turkey macrochromosome paints, zoo-fish with chicken microchromosome paints and single/dual color fish mapping of more than  <dig> chicken bacs to turkey metaphases. in addition, we provide a molecular characterization of inter- and intra-chromosomal rearrangements by fish mapping of bacs to chicken metaphase chromosomes, painting of chicken lampbrush chromosomes with turkey chromosome paints and hybridization of turkey chromosome paints onto a chicken whole genome tiling array. finally, we present comparative data on cnvs in chicken and turkey, which constitute the first array cgh-based data set on inter-specific differences of cnvs in birds.

RESULTS
chromosome painting
cross-species hybridization of chicken chromosomes gga1– <dig>  18– <dig> and 24– <dig> plus the z chromosome to turkey metaphases confirmed two inter-chromosomal rearrangements between the two species. the chromosome paint for gga <dig> hybridized to both turkey chromosomes mga <dig> and  <dig>  while the chromosome paint for gga <dig> hybridized to mga <dig> and a smaller chromosome which banding and ideogram analysis  <cit>  suggest to be mga <dig> . reciprocal painting of chicken chromosomes with chromosome paints for mga1– <dig> and z confirmed these results and were consistent with both inter-chromosomal rearrangements involving the centromere of gga <dig> and  <dig> respectively . orthology of gga4p and mga <dig> was also confirmed by comparative fish mapping of chicken bacs . further evidence of centromeric involvement came from the hybridization of chromosome paints for mga <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> onto chicken extended lampbrush chromosomes ; hybridization of the mga <dig> paint was not successful on lampbrush chromosomes. the chromosome paint for gga <dig> hybridized strongly to metaphases of both species, however the size of the chromosome painted appeared much larger in turkey than in chicken. numerous attempts at cross-species painting for the remainder of the microchromosomes  were not successful and chromosome paints were not available for chromosomes gga14– <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

single and dual color fish mapping of bacs
using single and dual color fish we successfully mapped  <dig> bacs in both chicken and turkey , approximately 70% of the bacs mapped in chicken also mapped to turkey. one or more chicken bacs from gga1– <dig> and z  all successfully hybridized to turkey chromosomes. these experiments confirmed the chromosome painting results and, in addition, suggested that there were no further inter-chromosomal rearrangements. three intra-chromosomal rearrangements nevertheless were detected: the centric nature of the breakpoint that led to the evolution of mga <dig> and mga <dig> and the presence of a small short arm on mga <dig> which contains the bacs identified by markers mcw <dig> and lei <dig>  is consistent with a pericentric inversion . moreover, these two bacs co-localize with bac mcw <dig> on gga <dig> but are approximately 20% of the chromosome further away in mga <dig> , again suggesting that a pericentric inversion is the likely mechanism. for gga <dig> and its orthologue mga <dig>  the presence of bac p5a <dig> above the centromere in chicken but around one tenth of the way down chromosome  <dig> in turkey  again, provides evidence of a pericentric inversion . finally the presence of bac mcw <dig> near the middle of mga <dig>  and towards the telomere of gga <dig>  gave clear evidence of a third pericentric inversion . the fish mapping data were used to construct a cytogenetic map of the turkey, which have been uploaded to a publicly available database on the arkdb browser  <cit> . chromosome painting and bac mapping data for the microchromosomes are summarized in table  <dig> 

as mentioned above, chromosome painting experiments suggest centromeric breakpoint/fusion points in gga <dig> and gga <dig>  this was confirmed by systematic fish mapping of a further  <dig> bacs to gga <dig> and  <dig> and mga <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  of these bacs,  <dig> were on gga2p and mga <dig>   <dig> were on gga2q and mga <dig>   <dig> were on gga4p and mga <dig> and  <dig> were on gga4q and mga <dig>  these experiments narrowed down the breakpoint in gga <dig> to a region of  <dig>  mb  and the fusion point in gga <dig> to a region of  <dig>  mb ). bioinformatic analysis of these bacs in relation to the most recent chicken genome assembly  is consistent with the presence of the centromere between them in both cases, i.e. they flank nucleotide positions  <dig> , <dig> &  <dig> , <dig> on gga <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> &  <dig> , <dig> on gga <dig> respectively.

turkey chromosome paints on the chicken microarray
hybridization of dna derived from flow-sorted turkey chromosomes mga <dig> and  <dig>  and mga <dig> and  <dig>  to the nimblegen chicken whole genome tiling array further confirmed the centromeric nature of the gga2: mga  breakpoint and the mga : gga <dig> fusion point . hybridization of mga <dig> and  <dig> gave positive hybridization signals on gga <dig> between positions  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> . this is the position of the centromere on gga <dig> estimated to be located between positions nucleotides  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> . hybridization of mga <dig> gave positive hybridization signals on gga <dig> beyond positions  <dig> , <dig> . this is the position of the centromere on gga <dig> estimated to be located between positions nucleotides  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> . hybridization using the mga  <dig> paint failed to show any positive signal. thus the results of the cgh approach were consistent with those of reciprocal chromosome painting  and those of the systematic bac mapping.

sequence analysis of chicken chromosome arms
previous sequence analysis of gga <dig>  <cit>  suggested that gga4p retains the sequence properties  of the microchromosome it once was. an in depth analysis of the sequence characteristics of the chromosome arms for both gga <dig> and gga <dig> is presented in table  <dig> and in the cumulative plots in figure  <dig>  the analysis of gene density shows clearly that the number of genes per length unit is higher in the p-arm of chromosome  <dig> than in the q-arm. this higher gene density is also revealed by a higher cpg-island density and greater gene compactness. in addition the shorter arm is more gc-rich and has a higher rate of genetic recombination. in contrast, the characteristics of gga2p and gga2q are very similar.

array cgh experiments
hybridization of turkey whole genomic dna on the nimblegen chicken tiling path microarray revealed evidence of  <dig> cnvs . the mean and median lengths of cnvs were  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb, respectively and ranged from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb. from this analysis it is not clear whether these are insertions or deletions but 15/ <dig> showed a "loss" of signal in the turkey. these may also represent regions of poor sequence homology and thus regions that have undergone accelerated sequence divergence. we compared the location of these cnvs with the location of cnv polymorphisms in the broiler and layer lines of chickens . in all cases the genome of red jungle fowl sequence  <cit>  was used as a reference dna. comparisons between red jungle fowl and broiler/layer lines detected  <dig> cnvs with  <dig> cnvs/individual distributed on both macro- and micro-chromosomes. the mean and median lengths of cnvs were  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb, respectively . these lengths are similar to that found for cnvs found in human  <cit>  but fewer in number with an average of 24/human individual compared to the 8/chicken sample. comparison of the location of turkey/chicken and chicken/chicken cnvs suggests that 50% of the cnvs are likely to have identical positions. for the purpose of this study, they were designated as "hotspots" if the same cnv appeared more than once in different animals . the median length of cnvs is also identical at  <dig> kb.

the location of  <dig> out of  <dig>  cnvs were associated with genes or "predicted genes." only in one case  did there appear to be no genes associated with the cnv. this region however represented a highly conserved non-coding region of unknown function. in  <dig> out of the  <dig> cnvs  the regions were conserved in chicken, xenopus and zebrafish but, of those  <dig>  only  <dig> were conserved in mammals. this suggested either loss or rapid sequence divergence in mammalian lineages. many novel genes appear to be predicted in the non-mammalian lineages which would support gene loss scenario. cases of rapid divergence are supported by associations with the rapidly evolving proteins of the immune  and chemosensory  systems.

discussion
detailed molecular cytogenetic map of the turkey
to the best of our knowledge, the cytogenetic map of the turkey presented here is the first detailed cytogenetic map of any avian species produced by comparative chromosome painting and fish mapping of chicken bacs to another species. the availability of a comparative map between turkey and chicken will, first of all, allow the transfer of genetic information directly from chicken to turkey, thus expediting mapping studies in turkey. secondly it will help to target marker development in turkey through the prediction of new loci. finally it, and maps of other species, will provide insight into the conservation and function of sequences across avian and other vertebrate species. this data will include coding sequences and also functional non-coding sequences such as telomeres. the map is sufficiently detailed to allow accurate gene prediction in turkey particularly given that the rearrangements between chicken and turkey are relatively few.

chromosomal rearrangements between chicken and turkey
previous studies based on chromosome banding  <cit>  and zoo-fish with chicken macrochromosome paints  <cit>  suggest that gga <dig> represents the ancestral state  whereas gga <dig> represents a derived chromosome  <cit> ). this model is supported by sequence analysis which suggests that gga4p retains the ancestral sequence characteristics of the smaller chromosome it once was i.e. high gene density, compact genes, high cpg-island density, high recombination frequency and gc-richness  <cit>  whereas gga <dig> does not.

in the current study further insights are provided than were previously detectable by banding: on gga <dig> and its orthologues, banding analysis had previously been consistent with a breakpoint above the centromere . the evidence provided here however suggests that the breakpoint is centromeric and thus a second mechanism must have been involved in the origin of mga3p, probably a pericentric inversion.

the fusion point of gga <dig>  as well as the two other inter-chromosomal rearrangements was largely as predicted from g-banding analysis, i.e. involving the centromeres. moreover, although a few of the flpter measurements between the two species led to "crossed lines" , all of these were within an acceptable margin of error and thus no evidence of paracentric inversions was found. the locations of bacs on the sequence maps are in most cases derived from the position of the  marker that was used to isolate that particular bac. therefore some of these inconsistencies may be explained by an incorrect marker-bac pair.

for gga11– <dig> and gga23– <dig> we provide the first evidence suggesting that there are no inter-chromosomal changes between chicken and turkey among this set of microchromosomes. this is in line with results from earlier studies that used dual color fish mapping of a limited number of bacs to examine synteny of microchromosomes in duck   <cit>  and quail   <cit>  and found no evidence for inter-chromosomal rearrangements among microchromosomes. in the present study, only metaphase microchromosomes were examined, which provides limited resolution due to the small size of the microchromosomes; we therefore cannot preclude the existence of intra-chromosomal rearrangements until experiments with very elongated  chromosomes are performed. moreover we cannot exclude the existence of small local rearrangements that are beyond the resolution of our mapping methods. for chromosomes 29– <dig> , chromosome painting experiments were largely unsuccessful, we believe this was because these chromosome paints were generated from single templates and were comparatively weak, even on chicken metaphases  <cit> . the relatively different sizes of gga <dig> and its turkey orthologue mga <dig> provide evidence for our previous suggestion that this chromosome paint is so bright compared to others largely because the chromosome consists of repeat elements in chicken  <cit> . the paucity of markers on the sex chromosomes precluded a full analysis of the z  and any analysis at all on the w chromosome. the position of the centromere on the z chromosome is different in chicken and turkey, but this most likely results from the accumulation of heterochromatin on the chicken z  <cit> .

recent evidence  <cit>  suggests that chicken chromosome  <dig>  differs from the other group b-d chromosomes  in having a gc content, exon density and repeat density similar to that of the group a chromosomes  and may be translocated to chromosome  <dig> in turkey. unfortunately, and frustratingly although we had several bac markers from chicken chromosome  <dig>  none worked successfully across species despite several attempts; we were thus unable to establish whether a further fission or fusion event occurred between the ancestral orthologues of gga <dig> and gga <dig>  it is notable however that the use of the chromosome paint for mga <dig> on to chicken chromosomes did not reveal hybridization to a microchromosome in chicken.

the results of the present study therefore confirm that chicken and turkey karyotypes  have undergone very few chromosomal rearrangements during evolution and extends this finding to the majority of the microchromosomes. by comparison, humans and new world monkeys  have around  <dig> inter-chromosomal rearrangements; humans and lesser apes  have many more  <cit> , rats and mice  have  <dig>  <cit> . although it might be argued that mice and lesser apes are extreme examples of where extensive rearrangements have occurred, the general rate of inter-chromosome rearrangement in mammals is thought to be one every  <dig> million years  <cit> . if this model held true for birds then we might expect about  <dig> or  <dig> differences between chicken and turkey since they diverged 25– <dig> million years ago . taking into account how many more chromosomes birds have than mammals and the further evidence  of the apparent paucity of arrangements between macrochromosomes in all birds  it seems reasonable to suggest that conservation of synteny among the genomes of avian species appears to be much greater in birds than in mammals.

approaches for determining the molecular nature of inter-chromosomal changes
in applying three approaches to determine the molecular nature of inter-chromosomal changes we have the opportunity to corroborate the accuracy of each independently. in essence the cross species painting is limited in its resolution, even when applied to lampbrush chromosomes unless, as in this case here, when we wish to correlate the breakpoint to an identifiable chromosomal structure such as a centromere. the systematic bac mapping is accurate but laborious and relies on all bacs working cross species . the use of turkey chromosome paints on to the tiling path array however was a single experiment. the potential for applying flow-sorted chromosome paints to tiling path arrays as a means of determining ancestral breakpoint and fusion points is enormous.

the results from the three approaches were not congruent for mga <dig>  which gave a signal only when hybridized to turkey and chicken metaphase chromosomes but not on chicken lampbrush chromosomes or on the chicken microarray. however, the chromosome paint for mga <dig> gave a comparatively weak signal even on metaphase chromosomes; the relatively low quality of this paint is the most likely explanation for the failure of the lampbrush chromosome and microarray experiments.

cnvs as revealed by array cgh
cnvs appear to be found at a lower frequency in chickens compared to human, almost one-third in number. the basis of this is unknown but may be related to the three-fold more compact chicken genome, with fewer opportunities for cnv generation. the observation that almost 50% of the cnvs in the chicken genome appear to map to the same regions as cnvs mapped from a comparison of chicken/turkey genomes suggests a common mechanism of generation. a similar observation has been made by comparing cnvs in chimp and human genomes  <cit> .  <dig> cnvs were identified from a comparison of chimp and human  <cit>  compared to only  <dig> in this study. while it is possible that, when we look at several galliform species and several individuals within each species, more inter-specific cnvs may be located it seems unlikely that there would be an order of magnitude more. thus while chicken/turkey diverged from a common ancestor 25– <dig> mya and human/chimp only  <dig> mya it seems reasonable to suggest that the low karyotypic variability among birds  is mirrored by a low level of cnvs also. it has been suggested that segmental duplications facilitate chromosome rearrangements and correlate with cnvs; therefore the lack of segmental duplications in the avian genome <cit>  might explain the low number of chromosomal rearrangements in galliformes in particular and birds in general. comparison of other species would shed further light on this hypothesis. besides the generation of cnvs by non-homologous recombination or other mechanisms, cnvs may have functional consequences and may be of selective advantage. inspection of the genomic regions at the cnvs indicates that they are associated more often than not with genes. from table  <dig> it is clear that these cnv regions are also more highly conserved in avian/amphibian/fish species than mammals, suggesting a link with egg-laying species. the function of the novel genes found in these regions may shed light on this idea. an alternative to gene loss may be rapid sequence divergence in mammalian lineages. cases of rapid divergence are supported by associations with the rapidly evolving proteins of the immune  and olfactory  systems. this observation suggest a common link between avian and mammalian cnvs, where analysis of gene ontology  <cit>  terms showed that genes involved in acquired immunity, innate immunity, or olfaction were also significantly overrepresented within human cnvs.

comparative maps between vertebrate genomes suggest that rates of chromosomal change can vary widely  <cit> . in this study we extend these observations and provide further evidence that avian genomes are more stable both at the macro-level in terms of chromosomal rearrangements and the micro-view for cnvs. the fixation of mutations  is a product of the rate of their generation and the rate they are fixed in a population. the molecular processes that generate such genomic changes may vary between birds and mammals. for example, mammalian genomes have more repetitive elements and segmental duplications than birds and these sequences are thought to stimulate chromosome rearrangements and copy number variation. it must be borne in mind however that, once a mutation has arisen, it must be fixed in the population either by chance or by selective advantage, eventually to contribute to the differences between species. differences between mammals and birds at both the molecular, ecological and behavioral levels are therefore possible reasons to explain the apparent differences in the stability of their genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study to combine the modalities of cross-species chromosome painting, zoo-fish of known bac clones and array cgh to gain insight of comparative genomics between two avian species. in so doing the first insight into the conservation of microchromosomes is provided, as is the first comparative cytogenetic map of an avian species.
