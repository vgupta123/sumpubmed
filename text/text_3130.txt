BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  is an infectious disease caused by the airborne pathogen mycobacterium tuberculosis and accounts for  <dig>  million fatalities annually  <cit> . unlike non-pathogenic microbes that are eliminated inside the maturing phagosome of immune cells such as macrophages, m. tuberculosis brings phagosome maturation to a halt and manages to cope with various host threats including acidification, reactive radicals and nutrient limitation  <cit> . studying the transcriptome of intracellular pathogens, in particular m. tuberculosis, during infection remained difficult due to a low bacteria-to-host rna ratio. for different pathogens the number of organisms per host cell spans several orders of magnitudes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> for m. tuberculosis and up to  <dig> for chlamydia  <cit> .

the first insights into the intracellular life of m. tuberculosis provided by comparative microarray analysis, revealed a switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration, induction of the dormancy regulon dosr and iron scavenging as well as upregulation of β-oxidation of fatty acids upon infection  <cit> . similar technologies and quantitative real-time pcr were applied to broaden our understanding of specific aspects of intracellular m. tuberculosis  <cit> . microarray probes have the disadvantage of unspecific cross-hybridization between pathogen and host  <cit> , and most often such probes are not optimized for minimal cross-reactivity with other species. cappelli and colleagues  <cit>  estimated that non-specific signals account for up to  <dig> % of all signals. additionally, transcription of non-coding regions and missed or miss-annotated genes often remain disregarded due to a limited array design. quantitative real-time pcr has mostly been applied to small subsets of genes, since detection of each transcript requires a pair of specific oligonucleotides  <cit> .

dual rna sequencing  is a relatively novel technique to study gene expression profiles. this technique allows unbiased and simultaneous sequencing of transcriptomes of multiple organisms and therefore is a superb technology to study intracellular pathogens during infection of host cells. the sequencing reads can subsequently be matched in-silico to the respective organism. without prior knowledge of sample content, its composition can be deduced from dual rna-seq datasets without targeting specific species  <cit> . most importantly, dual rna-seq captures the transcriptome in its entirety thereby overcoming the limitations of microarrays discussed above. first application of this technology to study m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis during macrophage infection has shed new light on mycobacterial iron acquisition  <cit> .

the attenuated tb vaccine strain m. bovis bacillus calmette–guérin  has been widely used in research as surrogate for pathogenic m. tuberculosis due to a high degree of genome identity  <cit> . in this study, we investigated the transcriptional adaptation of m. bovis bcg 24 hours after infection of the human macrophage-like cell line thp- <dig> by dual rna-seq. the underrepresentation of bacterial rna in preparations of total rna from infected host cells requires high sequencing depth to gain statistical significance and adequate pathogen coverage, leading to increased costs. mangan and colleagues developed a method entailing differential lysis with guanidine thiocyanate to enrich for mycobacteria from infected macrophages, thus avoiding massive underrepresentation of bacterial rna as compared to total rna preparations of infected cells  <cit> . this method has been used for in vivo transcriptome studies using microarrays  <cit> . here we present a strategy that combines bacterial enrichment for bacterial transcripts and dual rna-seq, which we evaluate against non-enriched samples.

RESULTS
twenty-four hours post-infection, thp- <dig> cells were harvested and total rna was isolated. additionally, two out of three infected thp- <dig> samples were enriched for m. bovis bcg bacilli, using the procedure described in methods. the analysis of the 50-bp rna-derived paired-end sequencing data is illustrated in figure  <dig>  two out of the three datasets derived from the non-enriched infections  were compared to a reference sample with uninfected thp- <dig> cells  and differentially expressed thp- <dig> genes were identified. for differential m. bovis bcg gene and small rna expression analysis, the datasets derived from enriched infections  were compared to a reference culture of exponentially growing m. bovis bcg . a spike-in sample  was used to estimate the percentage of infected cells and to correlate the reads of spiked-in m. bovis bcg with the m. bovis bcg culture and the non-enriched thp- <dig> infections with m. bovis bcg. an overview of the primary sequencing data is depicted in table  <dig> figure  <dig>

pathogen specific enrichment strategy is effective
it has been estimated that a minimum of 2– <dig> million reads from a ribosomal rna-depleted library is required to adequately cover the gene expression profile of a pathogen in a dual rna-seq experiment  <cit> . datasets if <dig>  if <dig> and if <dig>  derived from non-enriched infections contained  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  million 50-bp reads that aligned to the m. bovis bcg genome, which was too low for significant coverage of the gene expression profile. subsequently, an enrichment strategy for m. bovis bcg was applied to overcome this obstacle, thereby increasing the coverage of intracellular m. bovis bcg transcripts. these enriched datasets  contained  <dig>  and  <dig>  million 50-bp reads that aligned to the m. bovis bcg genome .

the absolute number of m. bovis bcg reads of all infected sample preparations was subsequently classified in four different categories: protein-coding rna, ribosomal rna, small rna, and other . we simulated the relationship between the number of identified differentially expressed protein-coding m. bovis bcg genes and sequencing depth . for very low numbers of sequencing reads, the number of identified genes increases in a linear way with the library size. with increasing library size the number of correct identifications tends to stabilize . the relative abundance of the four different categories was fairly similar in both, enriched and non-enriched samples, demonstrating that impact of enrichment per se on m. bovis bcg derived sequencing reads is negligible . the normalized counts of the protein coding m. bovis bcg transcripts in the enriched datasets  and the non-enriched datasets  revealed a linear relationship, with pearson’s correlation coefficients of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . we conclude that pathogen enrichment does not introduce any bias to protein-coding gene expression of m. bovis bcg. however, the correlation for normalized counts per gene of thp- <dig> reads between the same datasets is much lower,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . therefore, the non-enriched datasets  were used for differential gene expression analysis of thp- <dig> genes. this enrichment procedure thus enabled us to study the intracellular gene expression of m. bovis bcg during infection.figure  <dig>

m. bovis bcg response to infection
twenty-four hours post-infection a clear response of the phagocytosed m. bovis bcg bacilli can be observed on the transcriptome level. a total of 367 m. bovis bcg genes were differentially expressed , of which  <dig> were induced and  <dig> were repressed. a list of all differentially expressed genes of both m. bovis bcg and thp- <dig> cells is provided in additional file  <dig> 

m. bovis bcg cholesterol catabolism genes are induced during infection
cholesterol is a complex lipid that consists of three cyclohexane rings , a cyclopentane ring , and an 8-carbon side chain. an incomplete degradation pathway of cholesterol was recently proposed for m. tuberculosis  <cit> . this pathway was extended with the side chain degradation of rings c and d  and several genes involved in the pathway were added based on additional literature  <cit> . this extended cholesterol degradation pathway has been previously described in a genome-scale metabolic model of m. tuberculosis  <cit> .

we observed a strong increase in expression of almost all genes assigned to cholesterol degradation . initially, cholesterol is taken up by the transport system encoded by the mce <dig> gene cluster  <cit> . the 3β-hydroxyl group is oxidized and isomerized to cholest-4-en-3-one either by the membrane-bound oxidase chod or by the dehydrogenase hsdd  <cit> . no apparent induction of the mce <dig> operon, the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  and cholesterol oxidase  coding genes was observed in our datasets. however, the number of transcript reads assigned to the mce <dig> operon and to chod and hsdd indicate that they were expressed in both the infectious and the non-infectious state .figure  <dig> 
metabolic processes during infection. genes in green are induced upon infection , genes in red are repressed  and genes in black show no differential expression.  cholesterol degradation is divided in three parts: the degradation of the side chain , degradation of rings a and b  and the degradation of the side chain of rings c and d . dashed arrows represent multiple reactions. the degradation of the rings c and d side chain is based on homologous genes from rhodococcus equi. ad: 4-androstenedione, add:  <dig> -androstenedione, 9ohadd: 9-hydroxy- <dig> , androstene-3-17-dione, 3-hsa: 3-hydroxy- <dig> -seconandrost- <dig> ,5-triene- <dig> -dione  <dig> -dhsa:  <dig> -dihydroxy- <dig> -seconandrost- <dig> ,5-triene- <dig> -dione  <dig>  dsha:  <dig> - <dig> -diseco-3-hydroxy- <dig> ,17-trioxoandrosta- <dig> -diene-4-oic acid, hip:  <dig> -dioxo- <dig> , <dig> , <dig> -hexanorandrostan-5-oic acid, 5oh-hip: 5-hydroxy-methylhexahydro-1-indanone propionate.  aspartate could be imported via ansp <dig> and used for the synthesis of vitamin b <dig>  glutamate and methionine. thrb, dapa and nadabc are downregulated, indicating that aspartate is to a lesser extent used to synthesize threonine, lysine and nad.



although the degradation of rings a and b is well established, the side chain degradation of rings c and d  is less understood in mycobacteria and therefore was reconstructed based on orthology with rhodococcus equi genes  <cit> .

kstr and kstr <dig>  have been previously identified as regulators of cholesterol utilization in mycobacteria  <cit> . the kstr <dig> regulon comprises kstr <dig> itself and all genes linked to the degradation of the side chain of rings c and d, whereas genes regulated by kstr participate in the degradation of rings a and b and the initial degradation of the cholesterol side-chain . in our datasets the expression of kstr <dig> was strongly induced upon infection, whereas kstr remained unchanged . to verify these findings and the expression of other genes we selected a subset of  <dig> genes, of which  <dig> encode small rnas, and designed primers  to use for qrt-pcr. among the selected genes,  <dig> genes are involved in cholesterol catabolism and  <dig> genes encode enzymes of the methylcitrate cycle . the qrt-pcr results confirmed the integrity of our rna-seq data.

we analyzed the behavior of the genes in the cholesterol degradation pathway in a compendium of expression data collected for m. tuberculosis. although no condition associated with cholesterol utilization has been included in the compendium, many conditions in our compendium lead to differential expression of genes regulated by kstr and kstr <dig> . yet, a reduced set of kstr2-regulated genes  exists, which seems to be specifically induced upon infection and most likely specifically reacts to only this kind of perturbation. the specific induction renders fadd <dig>  fade <dig> and ipda of potential interest for therapeutic intervention. bioinformatics analysis using the consensus ider binding motif  <cit>  and the kstr <dig> binding motif  <cit>  revealed that these regions overlap .figure  <dig> 
variance in expression levels  compared to the fold changes upon infection. genes in blue are kstr2-regulated whereas orange genes denote kstr-regulated genes. genes in black show no significant change . green/violet ellipses denote areas of high/low variability in the expression compendium. *in m. tuberculosis h37rv, cyp <dig> has the same function as cyp <dig>  in m. bovis bcg, cyp <dig> encodes an inactive product.
regulation of the cholesterol degradation pathway by ider, kstr and kstr <dig>  sequences similar to the ider binding boxes appear in the upstream regions of genes in the cholesterol degradation pathway in close proximity to  the kstr and kstr <dig> binding regions.  under either normal iron availability or lack of cholesterol either ider or kstr/kstr <dig> represses the expression of genes in this pathway.  only under low iron availability  and in presence of cholesterol , can the genes in the cholesterol degradation pathway be expressed.



griffin and co-workers  <cit>  found that although propionyl-coa can be derived from other host metabolites, the requirement for the methylcitrate cycle is largely attributable to the degradation of host cholesterol. the induction of the methylcitrate cycle and the slight repression of icd <dig> , encoding an isocitrate dehydrogenase, suggests that the oxidative part of the citric acid cycle is bypassed in favor of this pathway . this emphasizes that cholesterol is the main carbon source for intra-phagosomal m. bovis bcg.

expression profile suggests m. bovis bcg recycles mycolic acids
mycobacterial fatty acids are precursors for mycolic acids and are synthesized by at least two fatty acid synthases: fas-i and fas-ii  <cit> . fas-i consists of a single multifunctional enzyme, encoded by fas , and elongates fatty acids at the beginning of the mycolic acid synthesis pathway, while fas-ii consists of multiple enzymes and elongates fatty acids created by fas-i. the mycobacterial genes umaa <dig>  cmaa <dig>  hada, and mmaa <dig>  encode enzymes that further process fas-ii products . previous reports suggested that fade <dig> and fade <dig>  might be involved in recycling of mycolic acids  <cit> . taken together, the expression patterns observed in our study  indicate that new acids are rather generated by remodeling existing mycolic acids and host fatty acids than synthesized de-novo.figure  <dig>

expression pattern of intracellular m. bovis bcg suggests utilization of host aspartate
gouzy and colleagues showed that nitrogen incorporation from exogenous aspartate is required for host colonization by m. tuberculosis  <cit> . we observed changes in the gene expression pattern upon infection, regarding aspartate metabolism . intriguingly, the gene encoding the unique aspartate importer ansp <dig>  showed no significant change in expression, while its homolog ansp <dig>  showed a two-fold induction . gouzy and colleagues found that an m. tuberculosis ansp2-knock-out  mutant was able to grow on aspartate as sole nitrogen source  <cit> . moreover, an ansp <dig> mutant showed no growth defect in either resting or activated macrophages. the lack of induction of the sole asparaginase gene ansa , that can catalyze the conversion of asparagine to aspartate, suggests that, in addition to its reported asparagine transport capacity  <cit> , mycobacterial ansp <dig> imports aspartate from the phagosome during infection. some of the genes that encode aspartate-utilizing enzymes are induced, such as pand and aspb . in particular, aspb was predicted to transfer nitrogen from aspartate to glutamate, which serves as a central nitrogen carrier for alternative metabolic pathways  <cit> , suggesting that m. bovis bcg utilizes host aspartate as nitrogen source during infection.

the repression of de novo nad synthesis genes nada, nadb and nadc  and the absence of significant changes in expression of pnca, pncb, nadd and nade  involved in nad synthesis and salvage  <cit>  , indicates that bacterial nad may become limited during infection. the transcripts of enzymes catalyzing branching reactions towards threonine, methionine and lysine showed an unexpected pattern : both dapa  and thrb , involved in initiation of threonine and lysine biosynthesis respectively were repressed, while metx , encoding an enzyme that initiates methionine biosynthesis, was induced. we conclude that host aspartate utilized by m. bovis bcg might largely be converted into methionine rather than threonine and lysine.

the induction of soda  , encoding superoxide dismutase that destroys harmful radicals, confirms that m. bovis bcg counteracts reactive oxygen intermediates  produced by the host cell  <cit> . interestingly, aspartate has the capacity to quench roi by intramolecular oxidation of the sulphur atom  <cit> . although experimental prove has yet to be provided, it is attractive to speculate that mycobacteria produce methionine during infection to support counteraction to roi.

m. bovis bcg iron scavenging; siderophore synthesis, secretion and import
mycobactins comprise an essential class of mycobacterial siderophore molecules to access iron of the host. these molecules are synthesized by an array of mycobactin enzymes, consisting of several proteins organized in a megasynthase  <cit> . the mycobactin megasynthase genes mbtb–f were induced upon infection and so were the majority of additional genes involved in mycobactin biosynthesis: mbtg/i/j/k/n  .

the type vii secretion system esx- <dig> is essential for mycobactin-mediated iron acquisition and in vivo survival  <cit> . the esx- <dig> secretion system is regulated by zur   <cit>  and consists of  <dig> genes  <cit>  of which  <dig> were induced upon infection . the repression of zur, resulted in the induction of esx- <dig>  a siderophore transport system of m. tuberculosis consisting of mmpl <dig> and mmps <dig>  is required for infection of mice  <cit> . both mmpl <dig> and mmps <dig> and two other genes encoding an inner membrane transporter for mycobactin irta/b  <cit>   were induced . of the bacterioferritins bfra/b , only bfrb  showed a significant decrease. a possible explanation could be the reduced availability of iron in the host, and thus less iron storage capacity is required.

m. bovis bcg small rnas
small rnas have only recently been discovered in mycobacteria  <cit> . although their function is mostly unclear, they can be present in large quantities  <cit> . in our study, differential expression was observed for  <dig> small rnas . high transcript levels of the small rnas mts <dig>  mts <dig> and mts <dig> were reported in chronically m. tuberculosis-infected mouse lungs  <cit> . we observed a significant  induction of mts <dig> as well, although the fold change is small  compared to other reports. the expression of mts <dig> was repressed in our study, and showed a small fold change . dosr  induces the latter in m. tuberculosis upon hypoxia and infection  <cit> . the low expression  and lack of induction of dosr in our datasets, may explain why mts <dig> remained unchanged. we verified the rna-seq data by qrt-pcr . whether the contrary expression of mts <dig> in m. bovis bcg and in m. tuberculosis during infection is critical for virulence remains to be defined.

host immune response to m. bovis bcg is aim <dig> dependent
a pathway enrichment analysis using innatedb  <cit>  revealed that the thp- <dig> cells show distinct signs of infection  since we identified numerous enriched pathways involved in immune response such as ifn-α/β signaling, ifn-γ signaling and rig-i/mda5-mediated induction of ifn-α/β pathways. interferons  are synthesized by the host upon infection and trigger the activation of its immune system. ifns can be divided in three classes: type i ifns , type ii ifns  and type iii ifns  <cit> .table  <dig>

shah and colleagues  <cit>  showed that virulent mycobacteria, such as m. tuberculosis inhibit ifn-β production and signaling, resulting in the inhibition of the activation of aim <dig> . aim <dig> is part of the inflammasome that recognizes cytosolic bacterial and viral dna, thereby contributing to the host's defense. in contrast to virulent mycobacteria, nonvirulent mycobacteria such as m. smegmatis, induce aim <dig>  <cit> . m. bovis bcg seems to respond similarly to other nonvirulent mycobacteria, as the transcription of the gene encoding aim <dig> is highly induced  as well as the ifn-α/β signaling pathway and the cytosolic dna-sensing pathway .

host genes involved in glycolysis and ketogenesis are induced upon mycobacterial infection
phagocytosis of pathogenic mycobacteria triggers the accumulation of lipid bodies in the host cell described as foamy phenotype  <cit> . secretion of mycobacterial esat- <dig> is required to mediate this process by stimulating the uptake of glucose into the host cell, which might lead to increased glycolytic activity and elevated levels of acetyl-coa, which in turn leads to the generation of d-3-hydroxybutyrate via ketogenesis  <cit> . although m. bovis bcg lost the esx- <dig> locus, a major virulence determinant of pathogenic mycobacteria that encodes the effector proteins esat- <dig> and cfp- <dig>  <cit> , we observe increased expression of several glycolytic enzymes including hk <dig>  gpi, pfkp, fbpi, gapdh, and pgam <dig> . moreover, we found genes of the ketogenesis pathway induced: acat <dig>  hmgcs <dig>  bdh <dig> and hmgcr. the latter gene encodes hmg-coa reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl coa and leads to the synthesis of cholesterol and other sterols. bdh <dig> encodes 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the reversible conversion of acetoacetate to d-3-hydroxybutyrate. subsequent steps that lead to mycobacteria-induced formation of lipid bodies in the host cell involve the activation of the anti-lipolytic g protein-coupled receptor gpr109a, which triggers adenylyl cyclase. the resulting decrease in host cyclic amp levels leads to a decrease in phosphorylation of stored host lipids by protein kinase a , rendering them less vulnerable to lipolysis by hormone sensitive lipase , thus promoting the formation of lipid bodies  <cit> . consistent with the attenuated m. bovis bcg strain, we do not observe a change in the expression of gpr109a, adenylyl cyclase, pka and hsl, indicating that this part of the pathway leading to the formation of lipid bodies is not active in the host or that this response is regulated post-transcriptionally and therefore remains invisible using a transcriptome approach.

taken together, despite the absence of the esx- <dig> locus in m. bovis bcg, the host response regarding the initial steps of lipid body formation is similar to that of m. tuberculosis. several pathogen factors including mycolic acids that were demonstrated to induce the foamy phenotype in macrophages  <cit> , may therefore be required to reprogram the host for lipid build-up.

cholesterol is synthesized and iron losses are compensated by the host upon infection
four out of seven genes in the thp- <dig> iron uptake and transport pathway were induced. the enzyme encoded by the induced gene hmox <dig> encodes heme oxygenase  <dig>  assigned to iron uptake and transport, catalyzes the rate-limiting step of heme degradation and is required to confer host resistance to mycobacterial infection in mice  <cit> . among the other induced genes were fth <dig> and ftl, encoding the heavy and light polypeptide of ferritin. this suggests that the thp- <dig> cells compensate for the loss of iron caused by m. bovis bcg, by taking up extra iron and degrading heme.

the thp- <dig> cholesterol biosynthesis pathway was induced, as six genes of this pathway, including hmgcr encoding the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol biosynthesis, were upregulated. we conclude that infected macrophages synthesize cholesterol to compensate for loss of this molecule caused by mycobacterial catabolism.

discussion
this study describes a deep sequencing approach towards the elucidation of mycobacterial and host cell gene expression profiles during intracellular infection. initially we employed standard deep sequencing settings for eukaryotes to resolve the transcriptional profile of intracellular mycobacteria. although this set-up allowed, to some extent, analyzing gene expression in m. bovis bcg, mycobacterial transcript coverage was insufficient. increasing the sequencing depth was hindered by high sequencing costs, thereby preventing the method to become a broad application. thus, we decided to enrich for mycobacteria during sample preparation of infected thp- <dig> cells. indeed, the strategy applied greatly increased the coverage of the intracellular m. bovis bcg transcriptome. although mycobacterial gene expression can be analyzed in non-enriched samples , implementation of enrichment greatly expanded the number of reliably identified differentially expressed genes by 71% .

moreover, the sequencing depth simulation  revealed that enrichment allowed identification of differentially expressed genes that would have been missed otherwise. repasy and colleagues showed that for an in vivo infection setting with mice and m. tuberculosis the moi ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . therefore, when studying an in vivo infection, the enrichment might not be sufficient to obtain a similar sequencing depth as obtained in our in vitro study, for which an moi of  <dig> was used. to determine whether enrichment introduced any bias into the datasets, we analyzed non-enriched and enriched samples of two independent biological infection replicates. although the non-enriched and enriched samples comprised different numbers of intracellular m. bovis bcg reads, the transcriptomes of respective samples of both infection experiments correlated well as indicated by high linearity and correlation coefficients . additionally, the correlation of intracellular m. bovis bcg expression between the biological replicates of both enriched datasets was comparable with the non-enriched datasets , verifying that the enrichment procedure was repeatable and robust, and did not introduce any bias to the intracellular mycobacterial transcriptome. for host expression we identified a lower correlation between the non-enriched and enriched samples  . hence, the datasets of non-enriched samples were favored for analysis of the host transcripts in order to preserve accuracy of the transcriptional landscape during infection.

our method is dependent on differential susceptibility to lysis of host and microbial cells and not on a molecular sequence capture or depletion method as previously described  <cit> . this has the added advantage that small rnas can be detected and analyzed for differential expression. additionally, our method is independent of mrna polyadenylation, as e.g. microbenrich simultaneously captures and removes polyadenylated mrnas along with rrnas. we consider this a critical point because previous findings support the existence of polyadenylated tracts in mrna of mycobacteria  <cit>  and other bacteria  <cit> .

it has been shown previously that mycolic acid liposomes are phagocytized by murine macrophages, changing the morphology of the macrophages to foam-like cells accumulating cholesterol  <cit> . although the cholesterol degradation pathway is induced at 24 hours post-infection , the mce <dig> gene cluster and hsdd and chod were not induced. nonetheless, these genes were expressed in both conditions and respective proteins could be already present before infection, ready for a situation when cholesterol becomes available. for hsdd and chod, it is tempting to speculate that alternative genes with a similar function exist, since these genes have been found dispensable for cholesterol degradation in mycobacteria  <cit> .

gene regulation of mycobacterial cholesterol catabolism involves a complex interplay between kstr, kstr <dig>  and ider. kstr and kstr <dig> are the prime regulators of the genes depicted in figure 3a. a clear distinction between their targets becomes apparent with kstr regulating the degradation of rings a and b and kstr <dig> regulating the degradation of rings c and d. in addition, genes in these regulons  contain ider-binding sites in their upstream regions  <cit>  and in some cases a profound overlap between these binding sites was observed. this implies that these genes can only be expressed upon removal of both types of repressors: ider under normal iron availability and kstr and kstr <dig> during cholesterol shortage . the upregulation of ider-dependent iron uptake systems can be caused not only by low iron availability inside the macrophage but also as a response to the no-induced damage caused to iron-containing proteins  <cit> . hsac, ksha, and the cytochromes cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> are iron-containing enzymes  and lack of functionality of these enzymes leads to the accumulation of stable toxic catabolic intermediates, such as catechol derivatives and cholest-4-en-3-one  <cit> . the ider control of this pathway ensures that it is only expressed when the corresponding repair/replacement systems for iron-containing proteins are in place, therefore minimizing the risk of toxic intermediate accumulation.

it has been shown that aspartate functions as a major nitrogen reservoir in the host  <cit> . in line with this finding, we observed induction of aspartate utilizing enzymes . interestingly, we did not detect induction of the gene encoding the aspartate transporter ansp <dig>  but induction of its homolog, ansp <dig>  earlier reports demonstrated that an ansp1-ko mutant fails to import aspartate in vitro, but shows wild-type behavior in either resting or activated macrophages, even though aspartate is a major nitrogen source in the host. moreover, the absence of ansa induction suggests ansp <dig> functions as an aspartate importer during infection in addition to its role as asparagine importer  <cit> .

rodríguez and colleagues cultivated m. tuberculosis h37rv on even long-chain fatty acids and analyzed the transcriptome by rna sequencing, observing a dormancy-related phenotype  <cit> . although there are similarities between their in vitro model and our results, the induction of cholesterol catabolism, the methylcitrate cycle and aspartate metabolism are not captured using such a method, highlighting the differences between using an in vitro model based on even long chain fatty acids as opposed to studying intracellular infection directly.

CONCLUSIONS
dual rna-seq allowed elucidation of the complex interplay between m. bovis bcg and thp- <dig> macrophages. the comparison of non-enriched and enriched ribosomal rna-depleted sequencing libraries of two biological replicates from identical infection cultures, showed high correlation of sequencing reads without technical bias. taken together, microbe-enriched dual rna-seq is a powerful technology that enables the assessment of the global transcriptome of "low-number" intracellular microbes and their host as demonstrated by the simultaneous induction of m. bovis bcg cholesterol degradation genes and host cholesterol synthesis genes.
