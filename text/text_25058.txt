BACKGROUND
the rumen is an anaerobic fermentation chamber housing diverse microorganisms such as bacteria, protozoa, fungi and viruses. bacteria play a key role in rumen fermentation, which in turn greatly impact production and health of dairy cows.  <cit> . high-grain diets used to improve performance of dairy cows alter microbial communities in the rumen and the symbiosis between the host and these communities by causing the production of excessive amounts of organic acids  and lactate) . high concentrations of vfa and lactate can exceed the buffering capacity of the rumen resulting in major changes in the rumen environment, such as a ph depression, and reduction in the populations of many beneficial bacteria  <cit> . large individual variability of the rumen bacterial community, even in animals feeding on the same ration have been reported.  <cit> . other studies  <cit>  showed that dietary changes, like an increased inclusion of cereals in the ration, lead to shifts in the microbial community even though the ruminal microbiota was able to maintain a stable core of bacterial taxa. the populations of starch-fermenting and lactic acid-utilizing bacteria increase when high starch diets are fed  <cit> . an excessive depression in rumen ph causes a reduction in the number of cellulolytic bacteria  <cit> , major shifts in bacterial populations, and increases the lysis of gram-negative bacteria resulting in a higher concentration of free lipopolysaccharide  endotoxins in rumen digesta  <cit> . when the translocation of free lps from the rumen and/or lower gut into the interior circulation occurs, an immune response in the host is induced, causing metabolic alterations. moreover, the increase in proportion of bacteria such as enterobacteriacae during high starch feeding heightens the presence of virulence factors , which have the potential to cause inflammation  <cit> . nutritional strategies to prevent the onset of sara and translocation of lps in dairy cows are based on feeding sufficient amounts of physically effective fiber  and modulating the amount of easily degradable starch in the diet  <cit> . in addition the use of feed supplements to enhance the rumen microbial community and subsequently ruminal fermentation has also been suggested for this purpose. these supplements include the use of yeasts, like saccharomyces cerevisiae, strain cncm i- <dig>  <cit> , probiotic bacteria, like megasphaera elsdenii, strain h6f <dig>  <cit> , and dicarboxylic acids  <cit> , flavonoids  <cit>  and essential oils  <cit> . it has been suggested that the dicarboxylic acids malate and fumarate attenuate the ruminal ph drop during high grain feeding  <cit> , and that these acids increase the activity of the succinate-propionate metabolic pathway in several rumen bacteria, resulting in increased lactic acid uptake and production of propionate  <cit> . in in vitro rumen fermentative experiments, several essential oils , or blends of eo have been demonstrated to enhance rumen fermentation  <cit> . however, few in vivo studies have investigated the effects of eo on rumen fermentation and bacterial populations  <cit> . furthermore, the effects of addition of polyphenolic compounds like flavonoids to diets of dairy cows may include prevention of the ph reduction and the decrease of the acetate-to-propionate ratio due to an increase of the numbers of lactate-consuming and propionate-producing bacteria  <cit> .

a previous study described the effect of organic acid  and polyphenols  on reticular ph drop and acute phase response in dairy heifers fed a high grain diet  <cit> . in this manuscript we report the effects of these supplements on rumen bacterial populations in dairy heifers fed a high-grain diet.

RESULTS
illumina sequencing produced  <dig>  sequences across treatments. the average numbers of sequences were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the c, o and p treatment, respectively. the number of the generated sequences was not affected by treatment .

the p treatment led to the highest richness of the rumen microbial population , characterized by the highest number of observed species  and the highest value of ace . the o treatment resuted in intermediate values between p and c for both the number of species observed and the index ace.table  <dig> number of observed species, richness  and diversity estimators  in control , organic acid  and polyphenols  dietary treatments

the chao <dig> index was higher during the p treatment  compared to the c and o treatments. moreover, fisher’s alpha diversity tended  to be higher during the p treatment compared to the c treatment, whereas the o resulted in intermediate values. the shannon and simpson indices were not affected by treatments.

the permanova analysis showed a significant  effect of treatments on bray-curtis and unweighted unifrac distances . in addition, differences were observed in bacterial population among periods . however the interaction of treatment and period  on these measures was not significant pointing out the lack of a carry-over effects of treatments. the multiple-comparisons based on bray-curtis distance showed only a tendency  towards a significant difference between dietary treatments , while the multivariate analysis based on unweighted unifrac distance indicated a significant  separation between the c and p treatments . the comparison of the bacterial communities by principal coordinate analysis  with unweighted unifrac distance  confirmed a separation between the c and p treatments.table  <dig> permanova analysis of the effect of dietary treatments, periods and heifers on rumen bacteria dissimilarities based on bray-curtis and unweighted unifrac

discussion
this study was conducted to investigate the effects of the two feed supplements, i.e. organic dicarboxylic acids  and polyphenols , on the rumen microbiota in dairy heifers fed a high-grain diet. the effects of these additives on reticular ph, vfa, lactate and immune response was published earlier by de nardi et al.  <cit> . in this companion study both additives, o and p, attenuated the reticular ph drop due to high-grain feeding wich resulted in  <dig>   <dig> and 199 min/d spent below ph  <dig> , for o, p and control, respectively. in particular, the p treatment was more effective in reducing the inflammatory response that resulted from the high grain feeding without interfering with dry matter intake , whereas the o treatment caused the highest decline of the acetate to propionate ratio.

both supplements enhanced the richness and α-diversity of the rumen microbiota compared to control. this is in agreement with other studies  <cit> , which report a higher richness and diversity for cows with physiological rumen ph and rumen function compared to cows with impaired rumen parameters. this finding could have been related to the different ruminal ph conditions found in heifers fed p and o treatments, which spent daily less time below ph  <dig>   <cit>  compared to heifers on the control treatment. however, the richness and diversity were higher in the p than in the o treatment, despite the similar rumen ph values of these treatments, suggesting that these changes are also based on other factors than ruminal ph. other authors  <cit>  in fact found that fermentation products, like vfa, have a large influence on the composition of the bacterial community in the rumen. differences in the composition of the rumen microbiota between the o and p treatments could be explained by the different mechanisms of action of the supplements. however because of the complexity of the interactions among taxa it is difficult to clearly understand these biochemical processes in detail. the o treatment may have increased electron sinks for h <dig> allowing an increase of lactate utilization by bacteria which use the succinate-propionate pathway to synthesize succinate and  propionate  <cit> . this hypothesis was confirmed by the lowest acetate to propionate ratio observed during the o treatment as reported by de nardi et al.  <cit> . the blend supplemented during the p treatment contained flavonoids, e.g. polyphenols. thanks to antimicrobial activity of theser products  <cit> , the p treatment was reported to promote bacteria that metabolize lactate to vfa avoiding lactate accumulation in the rumen  <cit> . the higher richness and α-diversity found during the p treatment, which represent the diversity within sample  <cit> , could be the consequence of a restraining effect towards some of the dominant taxa present in the rumen during high grain feeding, thereby leaving nutrient substrates available for other microbial groups. despite differences in richness and diversity among treatments, the multivariate analysis based on pcoa explained a small percentage of the variance. based on the microbial analysis results, the pcoa discriminant model was able to separate the control treatment from the p and o treatments. this discrimination demonstrated an association between the rumen ph drop resulting from high grain feeding and a decrease of prevotella brevis as reported by fernando  <cit> , and an increase of abundance of the family christensenellaceae. to the best of our knowledge this is the first contribute that reported a relation between rumen ph changes and the abundance of family christensenellaceae. the change in the abundance of this family could be used as a microbial marker for a balanced ruminal ph condition. this relationship needs to be confirmed by further studies.

results from illumina sequencing showed that treatments affected the abundance of various phyla, orders, families, and genera. among the species investigated with qpcr only prevotella brevis was reduced by the p and o treatments. matsui et al. and khafipour et al.  <cit>  reported that prevotella spp. are involved in starch degradation and utilization and thus grow better at low ph conditions.

among the otus detected by illumina sequencing, the family pseudomonadaceae, order actinomycetales, and verrucomicrobia were reduced by the p treatment compared to the o treatment. these reductions were probably due to a potential antimicrobial activity of flavonoids as reported earlier  <cit> . decreasing the presence of these microbials was associated with the increase of several genera belonging to bacteroidetes and tenericutes. similar trends were observed when comparing the p treatment with the control treatment, but in this case there were also increases in the abundances of some firmicutes, such as genus butyrivibrio. the high grain diet fed to heifers in this study resulted in a rumen microbiota typical of high concentrate feeding  <cit> , although especially the p treatment affected this microbiota. in fact, the higher ph and the antimicrobial activity towards some microbial families, due to the p treatment, allowed an increase of bacteria which are usually favoured by low starch diets and a higher reticular ph. these include bacteria belonging to the family bs <dig> as reported by zened et al.  <cit>  and paludibacter  <cit> . the latter was found to decrease when steers were transitioned from a hay-based to cereal grain-based diet. even the genus butyrivibrio showed the same response, i.e. increasing due to a higher rumen ph, since it is usually involved in fibre degradation  <cit> .

the use of supplements over short times altered microbial populations. this shows that the rumen is a highly dynamic environment, and that the microbiota are capable of adapting to dietary changes. polyphenols, in particular, were found to increase the richness and diversity of rumen microbiota in heifers feeding high starch diets.

CONCLUSIONS
both additives  changed microbial communities in the rumen, including the decline of prevotella brevis and the increase of christensenellaceae. these modifications were partially explained by the attenuation of the low reticulo-rumen ph caused by both additives. polyphenols increased the microbial biodiversity in terms of richness and α-diversity more than organic acids, suggesting a benefit in using this additive in cattle fed high-grain diets. furthermore, principal coordinate analysis demonstrated the discrimination between control and supplemented diets. the differences in the composition of the microbiota in the rumen between organic acid and polyphenol supplemented cows were likely due to an antimicrobial activity of the latter that widened the competition among different taxa.
