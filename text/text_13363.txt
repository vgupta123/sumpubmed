BACKGROUND
mammalians present a limited ability for organ regeneration, whereas various non-mammalian vertebrates such as teleosts and urodele amphibians show outstanding regeneration ability. among them, the zebrafish is a useful animal model, which has been used to study the regeneration of several organs or appendages  <cit> . the adult zebrafish caudal fin is composed of multiple cell types, including fibroblast-like mesenchymal cells, osteoblasts, endothelial cells, neurons, and epidermal cells, and the fin regeneration process presents three stages: pre-blastema formation, blastema formation, and regenerative outgrowth  <cit> . following fin amputation, epidermal cells migrate to cover the wound within 12 hours post amputation   <cit> . the intra-ray mesenchymal cells and osteoblasts then migrate toward the amputation plane by  <dig> hpa   <cit> . from  <dig> to  <dig> hpa, these intra-ray mesenchymal cells and osteoblasts begin to proliferate  <cit>  and, as a result, a population of these cells, named blastema, is formed underneath the wound epidermis by  <dig> hpa . after  <dig> hpa, regenerative outgrowth starts and the ray blastema mainly consists of three distinct domains: the distal blastema, proliferative zone, and differentiation zone   <cit> . the distal blastema barely contains proliferative blastema cells, and the proliferative zone contains highly proliferative mesenchymal cells  and osteoblasts   <cit> .

since rapamycin presents various physiological functions such as antifungal, immunosuppressive, and antiproliferative properties, many researchers have focused on the identification of rapamycin intracellular targets  <cit> . mechanistic target of rapamycin , a serine/threonine kinase, has been shown to be a rapamycin target in yeast, and most eukaryotes have this protein  <cit> . the mtor signaling pathway is mainly involved in cell growth and metabolism as two distinct complex types, mtor complex  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . the mtorc <dig> signaling pathway is involved in multicellular processes, including protein synthesis, lipid synthesis, glycolysis, and autophagy, and is specifically inhibited by rapamycin  <cit> . mtorc <dig> signaling is known to regulate protein synthesis mainly through direct phosphorylation of s <dig> kinase   <cit> .

many signaling pathways, including activin, bmp, fgf, sonic hedgehog, insulin-like growth factor , notch, retinoic acid, wnt, and reactive oxygen species , are implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and/or differentiation in non-mammalian vertebrate regeneration, also known as epimorphic regeneration  <cit> . however, the spatiotemporal activation and function of the mtorc <dig> signaling pathway during epimorphic regeneration remains unknown. in this study, we explored the activation and function of mtorc <dig> signaling during various stages of zebrafish caudal fin regeneration, and identified the upstream signaling pathway leading to mtorc <dig> signaling activation during caudal fin regeneration.

RESULTS
spatiotemporal dynamism of mtorc <dig> signaling activation during fin regeneration
to investigate the molecular mechanisms of regeneration, we analyzed the signaling pathways involved in zebrafish fin regeneration using various inhibitors and drugs. our experiments indicated that rapamycin, a well-known inhibitor of mtorc <dig> signaling, presented a strong inhibitory effect on fin regeneration. to analyze the activation of mtorc <dig> signaling during fin regeneration, spatiotemporal distribution of phosphorylated s <dig> kinase , an activated form of s6k, was first examined by immunohistochemistry. although no p-s6k-positive cells were found in intra-ray and epidermal cells immediately after fin amputation  , p-s6k signals were detected as early as  <dig> hpa . the number of p-s6k-positive cells in the intra-ray, epidermis, and blastema was markedly increased, and p-s6k-positive cell localization gradually changed with the progression of fin regeneration. these p-s6k-positive cells were widely distributed in the intra-ray and wound epidermis proximal to the amputation plane from  <dig> to  <dig> hpa . from  <dig> hpa, these cells started to accumulate underneath the wound epidermis, and p-s6k-positive blastema cells were evident at  <dig> hpa . after  <dig> hpa, p-s6k-positive cells were mainly detected in the blastema and wound epidermis. at  <dig> and  <dig> hpa, p-s6k signals were restricted to three distinct domains in the blastema, the putative proximal medial blastema domain   <cit> , the bilateral stripped-domains , where differentiating osteoblasts and their progenitor cells are localized  <cit> , and the wound epidermis. on the other hand, it is interesting to note that p-s6k signals were absent in the tip of the putative proximal medial blastema domain and putative distal blastema . these results suggest that, although the mtorc <dig> signaling pathway is widely activated in the intra-ray, wound epidermal cells, and blastema cells until  <dig> hpa, mtorc <dig> signaling is gradually restricted to the putative proliferative blastema cells and osteoblasts after  <dig> hpa.figure  <dig>

to characterize p-s6k-positive cells during the pre-blastema formation  and regenerative outgrowth stages , the fin regenerates were co-immunostained with proliferating cell nuclear antigen , a marker for proliferative cells  <cit> ; zns- <dig>  a marker for all osteoblasts independent of differentiation stages  <cit> ; or runx <dig>  an osteoblast progenitor marker  <cit> . at  <dig> hpa, almost all p-s6k-positive intra-ray and blastema cells were pcna-positive , and all runx2-positive osteoblast progenitors were p-s6k-positive , suggesting that mtorc <dig> signaling is active in proliferative cells and osteoblast progenitors during the pre-blastema formation stage. at  <dig> hpa, pcna-positive cells in the putative proximal medial blastema domain were p-s6k-positive , except that the tip of the putative proximal medial blastema domain  was p-s6k-negative. in the bilateral-stripped domains, zns-5- or runx2-positive cells were p-s6k-positive , except in the most distal regions of these domains . a recent report showed that runx2-positive self-renewing preosteoblasts are localized in the most distal region and that runx2/sp <dig>  double-positive cells are differentiating osteoblasts  <cit> . our results suggest that mtorc <dig> signaling is active in proliferative blastema cells and differentiating osteoblasts during the regenerative outgrowth stage. these spatiotemporal mtorc <dig> activation patterns prompted us to further analyze the function of mtorc <dig> signaling in the pre-blastema formation, blastema formation, and regenerative outgrowth stages.figure  <dig>

mtorc <dig> signaling is required for cell proliferation, but not for cell survival during the pre-blastema formation stage
to examine the function of mtorc <dig> signaling during fin regeneration, adult zebrafish were treated with a specific mtorc <dig> inhibitor, rapamycin, 12 h before amputation  to  <dig> hpa . rapamycin significantly inhibited fin regeneration compared to dmso . in addition to rapamycin, we examined the two different pharmacological inhibitors, torin <dig>  <cit>  and azd <dig>  <cit> , in mtor signaling inhibition, and found that fin regeneration was also significantly inhibited by both torin <dig> and azd <dig> treatment . mtorc <dig> signaling inhibition, by rapamycin, torin <dig>  and azd <dig> was confirmed by the loss of p-s6k signal at  <dig> hpa . the p-s6k signals were markedly reduced by 3 h treatment with these inhibitors  and were nearly diminished by 6 h treatment , suggesting the specificity of p-s6k as readout of mtorc <dig> signaling. furthermore, fin regeneration was also inhibited by the knockdown of raptor, which encodes a component of mtorc <dig>  <cit>  using a morpholino antisense oligo nucleotide  . taken together, inhibition of mtorc <dig> signaling with these three inhibitors  or by knockdown of raptor suggests that mtorc <dig> signaling is required in the pre-blastema formation, blastema formation, and regenerative outgrowth stages during fin regeneration.figure  <dig>

we showed that mtorc <dig> signaling is active in proliferative intra-ray cells and osteoblast progenitors during the pre-blastema formation stage . to test whether mtorc <dig> signaling affects cell proliferation before blastema formation, pcna and runx <dig> immunohistochemical staining, a brdu incorporation assay, and expression of msxb  <cit>  and the xenopus ef1-α:egfp transgene using the transgenic fish xig8a   <cit>  were performed in rapamycin-treated fins. because cell proliferation starts at approximately  <dig> hpa in regenerating fins  <cit> , inhibition experiments of mtorc <dig> signaling by rapamycin treatment were performed from -12 h to  <dig> hpa . mtorc <dig> signaling inhibition was confirmed by the loss of the p-s6k signal at  <dig> hpa . at  <dig> hpa, the number of pcna-positive cells and the percent of runx2-positive cells were significantly reduced by rapamycin treatment , whereas the number of apoptotic cells was not increased in the intra-ray and epidermal cells , indicating that inhibition of mtorc <dig> signaling suppresses cell proliferation without inducing apoptosis. consistent with pcna and runx <dig> immunohistochemical staining, the number of brdu incorporated cells in both the intra-ray and epidermis was significantly reduced by the rapamycin treatment at  <dig> hpa . it was previously reported that msxb and xenopus ef1-α:egfp transgene are molecular markers for mesenchymal progenitor cells  <cit>  and proliferative cells  <cit>  in the regenerating fins, respectively. similarly to pcna and runx <dig> expression, msxb and xenopus ef1-α:egfp transgene expression was markedly decreased by rapamycin treatment at  <dig> hpa as determined by whole-mount in situ hybridization and egfp fluorescence, respectively . these results clearly indicate that mtorc <dig> signaling is required for cell proliferation, but not in cell survival of intra-ray and epidermal cells before blastema formation.figure  <dig>

mtorc <dig> signaling is required for cell proliferation and cell survival during the regenerative outgrowth stage
because p-s6k-positive cells start to accumulate underneath the wound epidermis from  <dig> hpa , and cell proliferation is suppressed until  <dig> hpa by mtorc <dig> signaling inhibition , identifying the function of mtorc <dig> signaling during blastema formation and regenerative outgrowth is difficult. we next examined the function of mtorc <dig> signaling during the blastema formation and regenerative outgrowth stages using rapamycin from  <dig> to  <dig> hpa . regenerative outgrowth was significantly inhibited by rapamycin treatment from  <dig> to  <dig> hpa , as observed by rapamycin treatment from -12 h to  <dig> hpa . mtorc <dig> signaling inhibition was confirmed by the loss of the p-s6k signal at  <dig> hpa . in addition, msxb and connexin <dig> , a molecular marker of proliferating cells  <cit> , expression was downregulated by rapamycin treatment in the regenerative fins . consistent with these in situ hybridization results, the number of pcna-positive cells in both the blastema and epidermis was significantly reduced by rapamycin treatment , as observed before blastema formation . in contrast to the pre-blastema formation stage, the number of apoptotic cells in both the blastema and epidermis was significantly increased by rapamycin treatment during the blastema formation and regenerative outgrowth stages . these results suggest that mtorc <dig> signaling is required for cell proliferation and cell survival during blastema formation and regenerative outgrowth.figure  <dig>

mtorc <dig> signaling is required for the proliferation and differentiation of bony fin ray after  <dig> hpa
as shown in figure  <dig>  mtorc <dig> signaling was specifically activated in the putative differentiating osteoblasts after  <dig> hpa. to examine the function of mtorc <dig> signaling in bony ray formation, the regenerates were treated with rapamycin from  <dig> to  <dig> hpa. inhibition of mtorc <dig> signaling was confirmed by the marked reduction of the p-s6k signal at  <dig> hpa . the number of brdu incorporated cells in the zns-5-positive osteoblasts was significantly reduced by rapamycin treatment . in addition, the number of sp7-expressing cells and expression domains of col10a1a, which are intermediate markers of skeletogenesis  <cit> , were markedly decreased in the rapamycin-treated fins . in contrast to differentiation markers for skeletogenesis, the number of runx2-positive osteoblast progenitors was unchanged by rapamycin treatment . these results suggest that mtorc <dig> signaling is required for proliferation and differentiation of the bony fin ray after  <dig> hpa.figure  <dig>

mtorc <dig> signaling does not regulate autophagy in fin regeneration
a recent study revealed that autophagy is required for zebrafish fin regeneration under the control of mapk/erk signaling pathway  <cit> . because the mtorc <dig> signaling pathway is known to inhibit autophagy  <cit> , we examined whether autophagy was affected by inhibition of mtorc <dig> signaling during fin regeneration. as determined using a gfp-microtubule-associated protein  <dig> light chain  <dig> isoform  transgenic line, autophagy was markedly upregulated from  <dig> to 4 days post amputation   <cit> . using an lc3b antibody, we detected lc <dig> in the wound epidermis at  <dig> hpa, and by  <dig> hpa, lc <dig> localization in the wound epidermis was maintained . moreover, lc <dig> protein level and localization were not affected by rapamycin treatment , suggesting that the mtorc <dig> signaling pathway does not regulate fin regeneration via autophagy.

igf- <dig> receptor /pi3k and wnt signaling pathways regulate mtorc1/s6k in fin regeneration
it is well known that the mtorc1/s6k pathway is regulated through the receptor tyrosine kinase/pi3k/akt pathway in cell proliferation and metabolism  <cit> . to examine the upstream signaling pathway regulating mtorc1/s6k signaling in fin regeneration, various inhibitors for igf, wnt, fgf, and ros signaling pathways were tested from -12 h to  <dig> hpa or from  <dig> to  <dig> hpa, and s6k activation was determined; igf signaling , wnt signaling , fgf signaling , mapk/erk signaling , and ros signaling . no inhibitory effect for s6k activation was observed using su <dig>  u <dig>  or vas <dig>  even though fin regeneration was suppressed . however, ly <dig>  nvp-adw <dig>  and iwp- <dig> inhibitor treatment markedly reduced the p-s6k signal in blastema and epidermal cells. the inhibitory effect of ly <dig>  nvp-adw <dig>  and iwp- <dig> on s6k activation was nearly similar to that of rapamycin during fin regeneration . these results suggest that both igf-1r/pi3k and wnt pathways activate mtorc <dig> in blastema and epidermal cells during zebrafish caudal fin regeneration.figure  <dig>

discussion
based on the localization of p-s6k, we show the spatiotemporal distributions of cells in which mtorc <dig> signaling is activated during fin regeneration . weak p-s6k fluorescent signals were observed in the intra-ray cells and epidermis as early as  <dig> hpa. further, the p-s6k-positive cells were found to be distributed in locations proximal to the amputation plane by  <dig> hpa, indicating that mtorc <dig> is one of the earliest signaling in fin regeneration, which is reminiscent of other signaling pathways such as wnt, fgf, retinoic acid, and activin  <cit> . we also show that mtorc <dig> signaling is active in proliferative blastema cells, wound epidermal cells, and osteoblasts during blastema formation and regenerative outgrowth  . inhibition of mtorc <dig> signaling from  <dig> to  <dig> hpa suppresses proliferation of these cells through the inhibition of s6k activation . these results suggest that mtorc <dig> signaling is continuously required for cellular proliferation during the blastema formation and regenerative outgrowth stages via protein synthesis.

it is well established that mtorc <dig> signaling activates anabolic processes, including the synthesis of proteins, nucleotides, and lipids, and, as a result, these processes promote cell growth and proliferation  <cit> . protein and nucleotide syntheses are controlled through the activation of s6k, and lipid synthesis is promoted by activating sterol regulatory element binding proteins in an s6k-dependent or -independent manner  <cit> . based on these findings, the p-s6k-positive cells observed in regenerating fins appear to be in a higher metabolic state that is stimulated by a wound signal. it would be significant to isolate and analyze these cells under high metabolic conditions during fin regeneration.

a recent paper demonstrated that zebrafish caudal fin regeneration is slightly inhibited by rapamycin treatment from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa  <cit> . however, the inhibitory effect of rapamycin observed was milder than the effect observed in our study. the rapamycin concentration used in this report was lower than that used in the present study , which may explain this discrepancy. in addition, while fish were pretreated with rapamycin before amputation  in our experiments, no pretreatment was performed in the previous report. in fact, we found that at least 6 h of pretreatment is needed to observe the loss of p-s6k immunostaining. when fish were treated with rapamycin from  <dig> hpa, the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on fin regeneration was markedly reduced, even when using a  <dig>  μm concentration of rapamycin . it is likely that these two different experimental conditions may be responsible for the difference observed between our study and the previous report.

a previous report showed that insulin-like growth factor 2b , which is expressed in blastema, activates the igf signaling pathway in the apical epithelium cells through two receptors, insulin-like growth factor 1a receptor  and igf1rb  <cit> . pharmacological inhibition using nvp-adw <dig> or nvp-adw <dig> caused apoptosis in the wound epidermis and blocked blastema formation, indicating that igf signaling between blastema and wound epidermis is critical for cell survival in the wound epidermis and cell proliferation in the blastema  <cit> . these results are consistent with some of our results showing that mtorc <dig> signaling is active in the wound epidermis before blastema formation, and is regulated by the igf-1r/pi3k signaling pathway. however, two phenotypic differences were observed between mtorc <dig> and igf-1r inhibition during fin regeneration. one is that cell death was significantly increased in the wound epidermis by igf-1r inhibition at  <dig> hpa  <cit> , but not by rapamycin treatment from -12 h to  <dig> hpa . because the igf signaling is one of upstream signaling leading to mtorc1/s6k pathway, the other signaling pathways might be involved in the wound epidermis survival. the second is that activation of mtorc <dig> based on p-s6k localization was observed not only in the wound epidermis, but also in intra-ray cells as early as  <dig> hpa. it is possible that, in intra-ray cells, mtorc <dig> signaling is activated through igf-1rs, other than igf1ra and igf1rb.

in addition to igf-1r/pi3k signaling, we also found that wnt signaling controls mtorc <dig> activation in both blastema and epidermal cells during fin regeneration by using iwp- <dig> . it has already been shown that wnt signaling directly activates mtorc <dig> through the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase  <dig> and tuberous sclerosis 1/ <dig> in zebrafish and mice  <cit> , as well as in mammalian cell lines  <cit> . in zebrafish caudal fin regeneration, wnt/β-catenin signaling indirectly regulates the proliferation of blastema cells, patterning of epidermis, and differentiation and patterning of bone, mediated through many signaling pathways such as activin, notch, fgf, retinoic acid, hedgehog, igf, and bmp  <cit> . because mtorc <dig> signaling could be mediated directly or indirectly through igf signaling regulated by wnt/β-catenin signaling, further detailed investigations are needed to elucidate the hierarchical relationship and crosstalk between igf-1r/pi3k/mtorc <dig> and other signaling pathways downstream of wnt/β-catenin during fin regeneration.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we showed that the mtorc <dig> signaling is activated in intra-ray and wound epidermal cells as early as  <dig> hpa, and continues to be activated in proliferative blastema cells, wound epidermal cells, and osteoblasts during fin regeneration. inhibition of mtorc <dig> signaling during the pre-blastema formation, blastema formation, and regenerative outgrowth stages by rapamycin suggests that mtorc <dig> signaling is required for fin regeneration. before blastema formation, mtorc <dig> signaling is required for intra-ray and wound epidermal cell proliferation, but not in cell survival, whereas during the blastema formation and regenerative outgrowth stages, mtorc <dig> signaling is required for both blastema and wound epidermal cell proliferation and survival. furthermore, during the regenerative outgrowth stage, mtorc <dig> signaling is required for both proliferation and differentiation of the bony fin ray. in summary, our study is the first report that uncovers the requirement and significance of mtorc <dig> signaling for the cell proliferation, cell survival, or differentiation of intra-ray cells, blastema cells, wound epidermal cells, and/or osteoblasts during vertebrate epimorphic regeneration downstream of igf and wnt signaling pathways.
