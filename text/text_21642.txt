BACKGROUND
marine ecosystems, covering approximately 71% of the earth's surface, host the majority of biomass and contribute significantly to global cycles of matter and energy. microorganisms are known to be the 'gatekeepers' of these processes, and insight into their lifestyle and fitness enhances our ability to monitor, model and predict the course and effect of global changes. nevertheless, specific knowledge about their functions is still sparse. the 'genomic revolution'  <cit>  has opened the door to investigations targeting their genetic potential and activity on the molecular level.

a particularly interesting representative of the marine picoplankton community is rhodopirellula baltica sh1t, a free-living bacterium which was isolated from the water column of the kiel fjord   <cit> . r. baltica belongs to the phylum planctomycetes, a broadly distributed group of bacteria, whose members can be found in terrestrial, marine and freshwater habitats  <cit> , but also in extreme environments like hot springs  <cit> , marine sponges  <cit>  and the hepatopancreas of crustaceans  <cit> .

in terms of cell biology all planctomycetes share several morphologically unique properties, such as a peptidoglycan-lacking proteinaceous cell wall  <cit> , intracellular compartmentalization  <cit>  and a mode of reproduction via budding. the latter results in a cell cycle that is characterized by motile and sessile morphotypes similar to caulobacter crescentus  <cit> . a specific holdfast substance produced by sessile cells allows r. baltica to attach to macroscopic detrital aggregates   <cit> .

at present, four planctomycete genomes are currently available  <cit> . of these, the genome of r. baltica is the only one completely closed  <cit> . the genome was found to be  <dig> , <dig> bases in size and codes for  <dig> open reading frames  plus  <dig> rna genes. originally, only 45% of the orfs were assigned particular functions  <cit> . thus, over 55% of all proteins in the genome remain functionally uncharacterized. these were referred to as 'hypothetical proteins' with or without the affix 'conserved' contingent on wider phylogenetic distribution  <cit> . a subset of these conserved hypothetical proteins is specific for planctomycetes  <cit> . it seems likely that some of these genes code for the unique planctomycetal cellular characteristics and metabolic traits.

the availability of the genome information triggered several key post-genomic studies including studies of the proteome  <cit> , enzyme activity  <cit>  and protein crystallization  <cit> .

in summary, these studies confirmed the hypothesis of glöckner et al. that r. baltica is a polysaccharide degrader  <cit> . it appears r. baltica is gaining carbon and energy from the decomposition of complex heteropolysaccharides originally produced by algae in the photic zone while slowly sedimenting with the marine snow.

marine microorganisms like r. baltica are exposed to rapidly changing environmental conditions such as varying temperature, salinity, irradiance and oxygen concentration. typically, sudden changes of these environmental conditions induce a stress response in the exposed planktonic community characterized by a distinct change in their gene expression pattern. this stress response enables the organisms to protect vital processes and to adapt to the new condition. such responses have been described for a set of organisms from different environments including shewanella oneidensis  <cit> , pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> , desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough  <cit> , xylella fastidiosa  <cit> , synechocystis sp.  <cit>  and yeast  <cit> .

to gain insights into the stress responses of r. baltica with respect to salinity and temperature the first whole genome array for r. baltica - also the first planctomycete microarray - was established and applied. the reported data will serve as a resource to expand our understanding of the physiological and transcriptional response of r. baltica to the wide range of changing environmental conditions a free-living marine bacterium is exposed to.

RESULTS
overview
 <dig> distinct, total rna samples were analyzed by whole-genome microarray hybridization. differential expression of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes was noted during heat shock, cold shock and salt stress, respectively, at one or more of the five time points when compared to reference samples . with only 45% of the genes in r. baltica's genome functionally annotated, it is not surprising that most of the differentially expressed genes were hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins. the complete list of the differentially expressed genes for each shift experiment and time point is available in the additional file  <dig> 

only 32% of the regulated genes in the heat and cold shock experiments could be assigned with a cog function  while 37% were assignable in the salt stress experiment . this is in line with the 36%  of cog functional class designations in r. baltica. a striking feature of the expression profiles displayed is the stereotypical response of a large fraction of the genome to all three stress conditions. in summary,  <dig> genes are up- or down-regulated at any time point for all stressors. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> are induced and  <dig> are repressed . 49% of the induced and 61% of the repressed genes were annotated as hypothetical proteins. the venn diagrams shown in figure  <dig> provide an overview of the specific and common genes of the three stress-specific responses. to identify co-regulated patterns of gene expression, we classified all differentially expressed genes of all three stress expressions into  <dig> k-means clusters based on their expression log ratio. to determine the necessary number of clusters a figure of merit was generated.  <dig> clusters were considered as adequate. the cluster data are available in the additional file  <dig>  clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> show a similar response to the specific environmental changes, called environmental stress response  over all experiments. clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> describe genes reacting to a specific environmental factor.

experimental design and array data quality assessment
the experimental conditions used were chosen to mimic the natural environment of r. baltica; however, stress conditions were constrained by the detection limit of the microarray technology used and, hence, were required to elicit a sufficiently pronounced response from the organism. in contrast to steady-state or single-time-point studies, time series experiments can show the dynamic of gene expression.

the negative, positive and stringency controls printed on the array gave no indications for unspecific hybridizations. co-hybridizations of two cdna samples prepared from the same total cellular rna  suggested that genes with an expression log ratio value greater than  <dig>  and smaller than - <dig>  for heat and cold shock, respectively, could be regarded as differentially expressed. salt stress log ratio values over  <dig>  and below - <dig>  were considered as significant.

effect of stress on rhodopirellula baltica
no growth was detectable during stress conditions nor were any obvious morphological changes by microscopic investigation. under optimal conditions r. baltica has a doubling time of 10- <dig> hours  <cit> , suggesting physiological effects are not measurable during the short stress period of, at maximum  <dig>  hours.

specific results of the shift experiments
heat shock
in their natural environment r. baltica cells can be regularly exposed to higher temperatures, for example, due to irradiation at the water surface. therefore, r. baltica cells were rapidly shifted from 28°c to 37°c and observed over a period of  <dig> min in the first experiment. this is approximately 9°c above the optimal growth temperature reported by schlesner et al.  <cit> . employing a higher temperature is very likely to kill the cells. the time series reveals a quick response of r. baltica to sudden temperature up-shifts. in total  <dig> genes are regulated out of which  <dig> genes encode hypothetical proteins.  <dig> genes  were regulated after  <dig> min. this number increased to  <dig> genes  after  <dig> min . the cog classes containing the translation  and amino acid transport and metabolism  were the largest down-regulated classes. up-regulated genes were assigned to the cog classes of replication, recombination and repair , post-translation modification, protein turnover and chaperons , transcription , secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism , cell envelope biogenesis, outer membrane  and general function prediction  .

taking a closer look at the response of r. baltica to thermal stress revealed the induction of many known heat shock proteins : clpb , groel , dnaj , grpe , hsp <dig> , dnak , as well as the atp-dependent protease clpp . also up-regulated were the chaperonins cpn <dig>  and cpn <dig>  as well as the cell division protein ftsh  . previous proteomic studies found the proteins of these genes as well, except ftsh, dnaj and hsp <dig>  <cit> .

the regulation of the heat shock response in r. baltica involves many transcriptional regulators. tetr  and gntr  showed an up-regulation, which affirms their important role in early heat shock response  <cit> . a gene encoding for gntr was also found in the environment on the planctomycete fosmid 3fn from a namibian coast metagenome study  <cit> . in e. coli the induction of the majority of heat shock genes results from a rapid and transient increase in the cellular level of an alternative 32-kda sigma factor  encoded by rpoh along with the alternative sigma factors e and  <dig>  encoded by rpoe  and rpon , respectively  <cit> . although, all genes are present in the r. baltica genome, they were not observed to be regulated, suggesting a significantly different response cascade.

r. baltica also showed an extracytoplasmic stress response. the gene coding for seca , belonging to the sec system, was induced. this indicated an activation of protein translocation, most probably from the riboplasma to the paryphoplasm or medium. proton channels were induced and motility was inhibited as the flagellar motor switch protein  was down-regulated after  <dig> min. this was followed by the inhibition of the type  <dig> fimbrial assembly protein  after  <dig> min.

cold shock
to investigate the response to cold shock, r. baltica cells were shifted from the optimal growth temperature 28°c  <cit>  to 6°c and observed for a period of  <dig> min. 6°c was chosen for this study as this is a common temperature in the baltic sea. sudden temperature chances occur naturally due to turbulences between water layers. further, the temperature difference of 22°c is generally regarded as standard for cold shock studies with bacteria  <cit> . compared to heat shock only one third  of the regulated genes were differentially expressed. out of these  <dig> regulated proteins,  <dig> genes  encode for hypothetical proteins. the cold shock response reached its peak after  <dig> min with  <dig> differentially expressed genes  and decreased thereafter . in contrast to the heat shock experiment, it seemed that r. baltica needed approximately one hour to adapt to cold conditions. like other bacteria, r. baltica responded to cold conditions with the up-regulation of genes coding for stress response , cell envelope and transport , transcription factors and solute uptake. genes for amino acid biosynthesis  as well as protein fate and synthesis  were down-regulated   <cit> .

transcriptional activity was regulated by the up-regulation of diverse rna polymerase sigma factors, such as rpod  and sigk . a homolog of rpod  was also found on the planctomycete fosmid 13fn  <cit> .  <dig> min after the exposure of r. baltica to cold stress conditions it started to express genes implicated in the modification of cytoplasmic membrane composition, fluidity as well as morphology. the alteration of the lipid composition in the cold has been previously reported in other microorganisms  <cit> . in r. baltica genes coding for cell envelope , transport , lipid metabolism  and  <dig> genes coding for membrane proteins were repressed after  <dig> min.

furthermore, r. baltica repressed genes involved in sporulation oppb  and o-antigen flippase , flaa  and pilus assembly , leading to reduced motility and budding ability. genes associated with amino acid biosynthesis, especially with synthesis and fate of glutamine  and glutamate  were also affected. the latter have been shown to be translated  <cit> . a glycosyltransferase  and glycosidases  were up-regulated at  <dig> min probably to aid in cell wall remodeling.

although, incorrect protein folding at low temperature is less expected than at high temperatures, chaperons and proteases are required to deal with intracellular protein perturbations  <cit> . here, this was observed in the induction of groel   <cit>  and htra-protease . one of the most prominent responses of microorganisms to cold shock is the induction of cold shock proteins. however, the two annotated cold shock proteins of class i   <cit>  were not observed to be regulated. one may hypothesize that the stabilization of rna in r. baltica employs a different protein compliment than observed in e. coli.

high salinity
as a marine organism, r. baltica must adjust to the haline stratification of the baltic sea  <cit> . while moving through the water column r. baltica cells are exposed to variable concentrations of dissolved salts. in general, an osmotic up-shift forces bacteria to change their physiology by activating or deactivating specific enzymes or transporters, in order to maintain osmotic balance  <cit> . to gain an understanding of the genetic events that occur during the early stages of salt adaptation, r. baltica cells were subjected to salt up-shock from  <dig> ‰ salinity  to  <dig> ‰ . previous experiments have shown that r. baltica is able to grow between salinities of  <dig> ‰ and  <dig> ‰  <cit>  and does not grow at salinities over 90‰ .

in total,  <dig> genes showed differences in gene expression over the whole time series.  <dig> of these genes  were annotated as hypothetical proteins. the salt up-shock results indicated an increase in the number of regulated genes over time. after  <dig> min,  <dig> genes  were regulated. the largest number  was observed at  <dig> min . r. baltica cells seem to adapt slowly to high salt concentration. this might be a result of the cell compartmentalization and resulting ability of r. baltica to temporarily resist higher salt concentration without notable cellular responses.

the response of r. baltica to salt stress includes repression of genes associated with the following cog classes: induction of amino acid transport and metabolism , lipid metabolism , transcription , translation process . induced genes were involved in classes of the heat shock experiment : ,  and . in addition, genes in the energy production  and cell division and chromosome partitioning  classes were induced . similar to other bacteria, r. baltica accumulated glutamate and trehalose as cytoplasmic osmoprotectants in response to osmotic stress  <cit> . glutamate dehydrogenase  showed an up-regulation after  <dig> min and was also present in the proteome  <cit> . trehalose synthetase tres  was induced after  <dig> min. cysteine, as a general protective component, was only needed in the first hour in elevated salt concentrations and was repressed afterwards .

the accumulation of compatible solutes is a widely distributed mechanism used in coping with changing salinity concentrations  <cit> . in r. baltica  <dig> planctomycetes-group-specific genes are annotated as hypothetical proteins carrying a domain of unknown function   <cit> . this domain belongs to a new family of solute binding proteins   <cit>  and was also found on the planctomycete fosmid 8fn  <cit> . nine of these genes were up-regulated during the first hour of the cold and salt shock experiments. during the heat shock experiment,  <dig> of these genes were down-regulated. in vitro experiments have shown that some of these compatible solutes also possess general protein stabilization properties in addition to their osmoprotective property  <cit> . these homologous proteins do not play an integral role in the transport process per se, but probably serve as receptors that trigger or initiate translocation of solutes through membranes by binding external sites of the integral membrane proteins of the efflux system. in addition, some solute-binding proteins function in the initiation of sensory transduction pathways  <cit> .

r. baltica up-regulated an efflux pump  and a na+/h+ antiporter   <dig> min after salt shift. both may play a role in the active export of salt ions out of the cells. quinone oxidoreductase-like protein , induced after  <dig> min, had been implicated in respiration-coupled na+ efflux as also shown in d. vulgaris  <cit> . regulatory proteins like sigma- <dig> factor rpon , rpoa  and rfay  were down-regulated. rpon and rpoa were found to be translated  <cit> . r. baltica inhibited the genes for cell division  and chromosome segregation  after  <dig> min salt stress, as well as diverse transferases  involved in the cell envelope modification. interestingly, the pilin transport apparatus and the thin-pilus basal body  were induced after one hour as were principle pilus associated adhesion  and pilb . genes coding for biopolymer transport proteins  were also induced. a homolog to exbd was annotated on the planctomycete fosmid 3fn  <cit> . it is known from studies of other organisms that genes encoding the flagellar and chemotaxis systems are up-regulated to move away from the stressful cations  <cit> . however, none of the flagellar genes were regulated and the genome does not harbor any essential chemotaxis genes except chey  <cit> . notably, the survival protein  and two genes coding for the mechanosensitive ion channel  were induced. the latter provides protection against hypo-osmotic shock, responding both to stretching of the cell membrane and to membrane depolarization  <cit> . genes in cluster  <dig>  seemed to be significantly affected by salt stress only.

common stress response
r. baltica showed a common stress response to all three tested environmental factors. several known general stress genes were induced, such as genes coding for the manganese-containing catalase , which is also present in the proteome  <cit> . ferritin and dps  or pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase  belong to a general stress cluster  and were initially described by hieu et al.  <cit> . thioredoxin  could serve as an electron donor for the up-regulated methionine sulfoxide reductase gene   <cit> . the genes could be regulated via rpon found on the proposed upstream sigma 54-dependent promoter   <cit> .

perhaps to cope with reactive oxygen species , typically present under stressful conditions  <cit> , the nitrogen fixation protein  was induced. nifu is involved in the biosynthesis and repair of ros scavenging iron-sulfur clusters. finally, the peptidase m <dig>  may have been induced to regulate stress response, sporulation, cell division, and cell differentiation  <cit> .

genes involved in r. baltica's fatty acid metabolism - for example, oa-acyl carrier protein transacylase , the acyl carrier protein  and the fabb  gene - were repressed under all conditions.

interestingly, the machinery for the rearrangement and interchange of genetic material was induced under all three stressful conditions. it seems to play an important role in the organism's long-term adaptation. r. baltica harbors  <dig> non-randomly distributed transposases in its genome. notably, under heat stress three times more transposase genes were up-regulated than under cold stress and twice as many as under salt stress. shared induction shows five is3/is <dig>  three isxo <dig>  two putative transposases , and one integrase . rearranging the genome to select the most efficient gene combination has been described as a common way to adapt quickly to extreme environments  <cit> . relaxed dna may also be required to get better access to the gene regions for increased expression. here, dna relaxation is suggested by the repression of histone-like dna-binding protein .

in line with an alternative global sensing and regulation system initially proposed by glöckner et al.  <cit> , a common pattern concerning sensing and regulation response was detected. r. baltica contains  <dig> genes belonging to the extracytoplasmic function  subfamily of sigma  <dig>  <cit> . the genes rb <dig>  rb <dig> and rb <dig> are up-regulated under all three stress conditions. studholme et al.  <cit>  suggests that ecf-factor rb <dig> is the regulator for the conserved hypothetical protein rb <dig>  the conserved domain belongs to a new group of proteins that share novel domains referred to as planctomycete-specific  or planctomycete-specific cytochrome c . rb <dig> contains the psd <dig>  and psc <dig>  domains, suggesting a function in redox reactions  <cit> . each domain is represented  <dig> times in the whole genome of r. baltica  <cit> .

additionally, at  <dig> min the ecf-sigma factor rb <dig> was up-regulated together with serine/threonine protein kinase . protein kinases are believed to be involved in stress response  <cit> . the serine/threonine protein kinase  and two histidine-kinases  were up-regulated during heat shock. whereas, under cold shock only one serine/threonine kinase  was induced. under salt stress a histidine-kinase  and three two-component systems  were induced.

finally, the ecf-sigma factor rb <dig> was up-regulated, but only under high salinity conditions. in summary, the results confirmed that ecf sigma factors, as well as two-component systems, are heavily involved in stress sensing and regulation of r. baltica. the importance of these genes in the natural environment is asserted by the presence of a homolog to rb <dig> on the planctomycete fosmid 6n <dig>  <cit> .

the down-regulation of genes associated with the ribosomal machinery  was observed. during heat shock and high salinity these genes were permanently repressed, whereas under cold shock they were only repressed within the first hour. of the  <dig> ribosomal proteins in the whole genome,  <dig> genes encoding proteins of the small- and large subunit  were repressed. additionally, a set of genes involved in rna metabolism, protein synthesis, as well as r. baltica's only translation elongation factor  were repressed. the genes for the conserved hypothetical protein rb <dig> and the hypothetical protein rb <dig> were co-regulated which suggests an association with the translation machinery. the repression of the ribosomal genes, along with a large set of genes involved in rna metabolism, protein synthesis, cell growth , has been reported as a general feature of the environmental stress responses   <cit> . it has been assumed that they are acting as stress sensors  <cit> . this coincides nicely with the induction of the ribosomal proteins at  <dig> min under cold shock conditions. recovery and ongoing adaptation of r. baltica was further supported by the up-regulation of the ribosomal-binding factor rbfa , which is, aside from csda, required for optimal growth at low temperatures  <cit> .

hypothetical proteins
approximately 50% of the regulated genes observed have no known function in each of the three environmental stress experiments. some of these share a similar expression profile . we propose that some of these genes are involved in cell morphology changes, stress sensing and regulation. the low number of known transcriptional regulators  in the genome of r. baltica  <cit> , coupled with the fact that most of the essential pathways encoded are not organized in operon structures  <cit>  support the hypothesis of novel global regulation mechanisms. hypothetical proteins that carry regulatory domains, like the fha domain in rb <dig> or a putative transcriptional regulatory domain in rb <dig> are strong candidates. rb <dig> might regulate the gene next to it, which is a so called giant gene   <cit> . this giant gene encodes a novel peptide motif that is most likely involved in cell morphology changes  <cit> . the importance of the hypothetical proteins rb <dig>  rb <dig>  rb <dig> and rb <dig> was further supported by their presence on the proteome gels of hieu et al. as well as gade et al.  <cit> . the latter three of these genes were claimed to be among the most abundant proteins in r. baltica cultures grown on mineral medium.

planctomycete special feature: genes encoding sulfatases
the genome of r. baltica contains no less than  <dig> sulfatases. it is assumed that they are involved in the recycling of carbon from complex sulfated heteropolysaccharides. although the mineral medium does not contain any sulfated polysaccharides, we found  <dig> sulphatase genes were up- or down-regulated  during the different stress experiments. these included one choline sulphatase , seven arylsulfatases , two sulphatase genes without specificity , and one alkylsulfatase . furthermore, during life cycle experiments  we found evidence that certain sulfatases are only regulated in specific growth stages, which could indicate their involvement in the remodeling of the distinct morphological features of r. baltica. sulfatase genes rb <dig>  rb <dig>  rb <dig> and rb <dig> were induced. we propose that rb <dig> and rb <dig> have an extracellular function and may be involved in the formation of an extrapolymeric substance.

six sulfatase genes  were repressed after  <dig> min of heat shock. they may have been involved in the rearrangement of the cell wall formation, which comprises a protein sacculus with disulfide bonds  <cit> . in summary, these results show the diverse roles that sulfatases may have and, furthermore, that only a variety of different experimental approaches will increase our knowledge of these roles.

CONCLUSIONS
this work presents the first transcriptome study of the environmental stress response of a marine, free-living planctomycete. although r. baltica is an unusual organism in many aspects, its stress responses to heat and cold shock as well to changing salinity were in line with earlier results reported for other model organisms. heat shock induced a set of chaperons, likely to protect cellular proteins from denaturation and breakdown. growth in the cold may be followed by the induction of genes altering lipid metabolism. salinity shifts resulted in the activation of planctomycete-specific groups of genes including genes involved in morphological change and an extracytoplasmic stress response. all stressors triggered the down-regulation of the ribosomal machinery, the up-regulation of transposases and the induction of several ecf-sigma factors and two-component systems. this supports the hypothesis that r. baltica is regulating its gene activity on a global rather than operon level. aside from well characterized stress response genes, about  <dig> genes of unknown function, constituting 30% of the genes predicted in the genome, were affected. this, combined with proteome studies and the presence of some of the genes in fosmid libraries, provides a strong indication that the vast number of genes with unknown function play a vital role in the organism's environmental response. the regulation of  <dig> sulfatases during stressful conditions suggests that these genes are heavily involved in the core cellular function of r. baltica. the data presented lead to the conclusion that r. baltica's rich repertoire of genes is combined with a fine tuned regulation mechanism to best respond to the changing conditions of its habitat. nevertheless, data analysis has just started and further investigations concerning the genes involved in the life-cycle, the stress response pathways, promoter regions and network analysis are already ongoing or planned for the near future.
