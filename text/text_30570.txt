BACKGROUND
written descriptions of the symptoms of malaria have existed for over  <dig>  years and evidence for the existence of the genus plasmodium has been recovered from amber approximately  <dig> million years old  <cit> . thus, the disease has probably evolved alongside its hosts since the emergence of the first humans in africa. in  <dig>  it was estimate that  <dig>  people died from malaria. this estimate probably represents a conservative number, as reporting of the disease is extremely variable from one region to another; generally, the regions with the highest incidence of malaria also have the weakest mechanisms for reporting and recording cases.

malaria is caused by protozoan parasites from the genus plasmodium. different species tend to infect different host species. five species infect humans; the two most widespread species are p. vivax and p. falciparum. the latter species is the most lethal. p. falciparum has a complex life cycle that spans the arthropod vector and human host. upon transfer from the vector to the human host, the parasite first infects the liver. after maturation in the liver, the parasite infects red blood cells. in this so-called rbc stage, the symptoms of malaria become acute.

a number of antimicrobial drugs have been developed over the years, notably chloroquine and artemisinin. however, in the past decades, the effectiveness of all these drugs has been significantly reduced due to the evolution of drug-resistant parasites, with the exception of artemisinin. recently, however, evidence has emerged that resistance to artemisinin has appeared and is beginning to spread. therefore, it is essential that new drug targets be identified and the development of new genomics-based technologies is key to this task. genome sequences from p. falciparum  <cit>  and other plasmodium spp.  <cit>  have been completed and these have facilitated numerous studies on, for example, parasite transcription  <cit> , translation  <cit> , metabolism  <cit> , protein-protein interactions  <cit> , and epigenetic regulation  <cit> . the data from these studies have, in turn, laid the groundwork for systems biology oriented studies of the networks associated with parasite development, survival, pathogenesis, and virulence  <cit> .

network alignment is a popular systems biology method  <cit> . however, because the malaria parasite is only distantly related to other, more completely understood model organisms, the utility of this approach may be cast in doubt. about 60% of the open reading frames in p. falciparum are annotated as "hypothetical proteins"  <cit>  simply because homology transfer of information about individual proteins is not possible across extended evolutionary distances. to tackle this problem, we recently developed a neighborhood subnetwork alignment algorithm  <cit> , which is focused on the similarities between functional modules, in other words, on the interactions among proteins rather than on individual proteins. we define a neighborhood subnetwork as the set of nodes  reachable from a central protein via a small number of edges in a protein-protein interaction  network. a proof-of-concept study predicted previously unrecognized transcriptional regulators involved in diverse facets of the parasite life cycle  <cit> . in this paper, we use the subnetwork alignment approach to uncover candidate proteins with roles in cell cycle regulation, several of which are potential drug targets. as our knowledge of the mechanics of the cell cycle deepens, so will our ability to influence parasite survival in the host and our ability to identify key drug targets.

RESULTS
neighborhood subnetwork alignments predicted  <dig> proteins that are associated with cell cycle regulation in malaria parasite
the cell cycle of the malaria parasite differs significantly from that of other model eukaryotic organisms. there is no direct correspondence between schizogony, during which the parasite undergoes multiplication, and the typical g <dig>  s, g <dig> and m phases of the cell cycle in crown eukaryotes. in addition, the parasite's cell cycle features asynchronous nuclear divisions, organellar segregation, and morphogenesis of daughter merozoites. a thorough sequence similarity-based search by doerig and chakrabarti predicted a list of proteins that might be involved in the cell cycle  <cit> , including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, proteins critical for cell division and signal transduction. in a previous study, we used a variational bayesian expectation maximization  approach to reveal the dynamics of the parasite cell cycle network, and to infer regulatory relationships based on time-series transcriptomic data  <cit> . the results from that study exposed gaps in our cell cycle network model. here we use our subnetwork alignment approach to try and fill these gaps.

we predicted that  <dig> proteins in p. falciparum were functional orthologs of known cell cycle proteins in e. coli . over 34% of these predicted functional orthologs were annotated as "conserved plasmodium proteins" or "putative uncharacterized proteins" of unknown function.

the set of functional orthologs is involved in key biological processes
 <dig>  cyclin
our subnetwork alignment approach predicted pfl1330c to be a putative cyclin  <cit> . cyclins are a family of proteins with expression levels that oscillate during the cell cycle; the synthesis and degradation of cyclins control the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases and accurate transition of key cell cycle points. yeast two-hybrid  experiments  <cit>  have shown that pfl1330c has physical interaction with an apical sushi protein  , which has an adhesive "sushi" domain and thought to have a role in the merozoite invasion process.

 <dig>  kinases
signal transduction plays a key role in managing the complexity of the cell cycle  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows eight kinases  that were predicted by the subnetwork alignments and the proteins that are directly associated with them. three protein kinases have been implicated in cell cycle regulation:

 pfmap <dig>  is a homolog of mitogen-activated protein kinase   <cit> . this kinase is believed to be a central member of the mapkkk cascade and may be related to parasite responses to a variety of exogenous or endogenous stimuli or environmental stresses. pfmap <dig> has three ppi partners:  a serine/threonine protein kinase  . pfsrpk plays a role in mrna splicing machinery  <cit> . gene disruption of srpk in the rodent parasite p. berghei suggested that it is essential during male gamete formation  <cit> .  myosin a  is a component in the linear motor that promotes merozoite motility in invasion.  mal7p <dig> , a conserved plasmodium protein of unknown function. this protein was recently annotated as a putative kinase  <cit> .

 pfnek- <dig> encodes a nima-related kinase and it is considered to be a potential antimalarial target. a recent study based on reverse genetics showed that it is required for the asexual cycle in red blood cells and it has sexual specificity   <cit> . pfnek- <dig> is shown by yeast 2-hybrid assay to pool with a conserved hypothetical protein pfc0345w. both proteins have abundant expression at the schizont stage.

 cdc2-related protein kinase  <dig>    <cit> , was observed as a phospho-protein in the schizont stage of p. falciparum-infected red blood cells. y2h showed that it has a direct interaction with an aaa family atpase.

the most highly connected kinase predicted to be involved in the cell cycle is the serine/threonine protein kinase pfclk- <dig>  with  <dig> association partners. ten proteins were pooled by y2h experiments  <cit> , including a rhoptry neck protein  <dig> , a splicing factor 3a subunit, eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig> subunit  <dig>  a chloroquine resistance marker protein , syntaxin involved in vesicle exocytosis, an export protein, and five conserved hypothetical proteins, indicating pfclk-3's involvement in merozoite invasion, splicing, translation and trafficking. global kinome analysis suggested that pfclk <dig> is likely to be essential for parasite schizogony in rbcs  <cit> .

a calcium-dependent protein kinase  <dig>   was predicted to be involved in cell cycle regulation by subnetwork alignment. previous phenotypic analysis showed that cdpk <dig> plays a role in sporozoite formation and invasion of hepatocytes  <cit> . this kinase is associated with  <dig> other proteins verified by y2h assays. two of the association partners are likely involved in cell cycle regulation as well: a putative ndc <dig> protein functions in spindle checkpoint signaling for kinetochore organization and movements, and a putative snf2-related cbp activator  for base excision repair and chromosome remodeling. pfcdpk <dig> is also associated with pfbet <dig> in snare complex for secretion, a putative protein localized to rhoptry that might be related to merozoite invasion process, a liver-stage antigen, a ubiquitin domain containing protein, and five hypothetical proteins.

the functional roles of other predicted kinases are largely unknown. pf11_ <dig> is a putative serine/threonine protein kinase. a gene disruption attempt suggested that it is likely essential for the parasite rbc stage  <cit> . this protein is associated with two proteins required for 60s ribosomal subunit biogenesis , and a pseudogene of surface-associated interspersed gene  <dig>  , which was implicated in the invasion process. mal13p <dig>   is a putative serine/threonine kinase in the aurora-related kinase  family. this family of kinases has been implicated in regulation of endocytosis and of the actin skeleton  <cit> . pfark <dig> has a weak association with an erythrocyte membrane protein  <dig>  pfemp <dig>  that may be related to mitotic recombination.

 <dig>  proteins implicated in cell division, chromosome organization, and dna replication
our analysis has implicated a number of other predicted proteins in the cell division, mitosis, chromosome organization, and dna replication processes. pfe0450w, a putative chromosome condensation protein that forms part of the atp-dependent chromatin remodeling complex  <cit> , was predicted to be associated with cell cycle regulation. as shown in figure  <dig>  are  <dig> proteins associated with pfe0450w. eight of these associations have been verified by y2h, a set that includes two tat-binding proteins pertinent to proteasome activities, a pre-mrna splicing factor, an eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig> subunit  <dig>  and three conserved plasmodium proteins with unknown function. perhaps the most important association suggested by our analysis is its link with the high molecular weight rhoptry protein  <dig> . rhop <dig> is localized in the rhoptries of schizonts and plays a role in cytoadherence and merozoite invasion of the red blood cell  <cit> . several key components including dna replication licensing factors and an origin recognition complex subunit were predicted by our subnetwork alignment.

 <dig>  dna repair proteins
the cell cycle is also involved in involving dna repair mechanisms that ensure genome integrity. a putative dna repair protein rad <dig>  was predicted to have  <dig> protein-protein association partners ,  <dig> of which have been demonstrated to be direct y2h physical interactions. this protein is a member of an escort complex for proteasome-mediated degradation of non-native er proteins. other suggested interactors with rad <dig> include heat shock chaperone proteins, atp-dependent proteases, serine-threonine kinases, and secreted proteins that have been implicated in stress responses, signaling cascades, and protein sorting and trafficking.

 <dig>  transcriptional regulators
seven parasite-specific apiap <dig> transcription factors were predicted to have a role in cell cycle regulation, underscoring the importance of transcriptional regulation. apiap <dig> proteins are gaining recognition as attractive drug targets due to their critical roles in the parasite life cycle and their distant evolutionary relationship to the host, implying a diminished possibility of side-effects for humans  <cit> . the apiap <dig> protein with the highest degree of connectivity in the cell cycle regulatory network is pfd0985w . its  <dig> association partners play versatile roles in epigenetic regulation, kinetochore organization, host cell entry and adhesion, secretion, and protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system  <cit> . the roles of another apiap <dig> protein  can be inferred from its associations with  <dig> proteins that are related to transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, replication, and repair. this protein has interactions with multiple signaling molecules including a calcium-dependent protein kinase and a ligand protein in the 14-3- <dig> family.

the involvement of pf10_ <dig> in apiap <dig> in cell cycle regulation is indicated by its y2h interactions with another apiap <dig> protein , a histone acetyltransferase gcn <dig> , which is important for histone modification and chromatin remodeling  <cit> , a dna excision repair protein rhp <dig> , actin  and a putative kelch protein whose ortholog was implicated in cytoskeletal function in atlantic horseshoe crab, limulus polyphemus  <cit>  .

 <dig>  surface antigens
a group of surface antigens in the plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein  family  were predicted to be associated with the cell cycle. encoded by the var gene, pfemp <dig> is one of the most abundant protein families in p. falciparum. its polymorphic nature leads to antigenic variation, allowing the parasite to successfully evade the human immune systems, thus contributing to pathogenicity and virulence.

CONCLUSIONS
we have previously developed a neighborhood subnetwork alignment approach and here we apply this method to predict the network components involved in cell cycle regulation. the network components identified included cyclins, kinases, transcriptional regulators, and cell surface antigens, among others. some of these are obvious and have already been confirmed by experimental approaches, such as yeast two-hybrid experiments. this validates our approach as a useful tool for in silico prediction of previously unrecognized interactors in cell cycle regulation and suggests that the expanded set of interactors discussed here form a new set of potential targets for drugs or therapies.
