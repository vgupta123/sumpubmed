BACKGROUND
with the recent availability of a large number of genome sequences for higher vertebrates, there are growing opportunities for understanding how genes have contributed to the evolution and functional organization of brain circuits for complex learned behaviors. among genes that may have evolved to shape the physiological properties of such circuits, ion channel genes represent highly compelling candidates. potassium channel  genes, in particular, are one of the largest and most structurally diverse families of ion channels genes and are known to regulate a wide array of neuronal functions, from resting membrane potential and intrinsic excitability to action potential repolarization and propagation  <cit> . whereas the fruit fly  has ~30 k-channels genes  <cit> , in the human genome more than  <dig> distinct loci have been identified that encode either the structural determinants  or accessory modulatory components . this vast expansion in vertebrates has been suggested as being related to the evolution of complex organs whose function requires the precise control of membrane excitability, such as the heart and the central nervous system.

here we describe our use of songbirds to investigate the relationship between the k-channel gene family and the emergence of a complex learned behavior. song is a learned vocal behavior that shares many important features with speech and language capabilities in humans  <cit> . the connectivity, physiology and pharmacology of specialized brain areas for vocal learning and production  have been extensively characterized in male zebra finches, the most tractable model organism for studying the neurobiological basis of vocal learning . the recent completion of the zebra finch genome sequence  <cit> , the second avian genome to be sequenced after the chicken  <cit> , has made it possible to search for molecular mechanisms that may have evolved in association with song learning. furthermore, vocal learning and associated neural circuits are generally lacking in most other vertebrate groups, including the majority of avian orders , rodents, and non-human primates. thus, a comparative genomics approach offers unique opportunities for revealing genomic features and specializations that may relate to the emergence and/or maintenance of vocal learning.

in songbirds, vocal learning requires a unique set of forebrain nuclei and projections that are noticeably absent in birds that do not learn to vocalize  a direct motor pathway   <cit> , which is essential for the production of learned birdsong ; and  an anterior forebrain pathway , which forms a cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop, and is essential for song learning  <cit>  and adult vocal plasticity  <cit> . this latter pathway is connected to the dmp through projections from hvc to x and lman to ra  <cit> . the anatomical separation of these circuits and the discrete nature of their component nuclei greatly facilitate correlating gene expression to specific electrophysiological properties that may underlie various aspects of sensorimotor learning and singing.

several lines of evidence suggest that k-channel genes may play important roles in controlling vocal production and learning in songbirds. for example, kcnc <dig>  which encodes a delayed-rectifier type k-channel that is typically expressed in fast spiking gabaergic interneurons in mammals  <cit> , has been reported as being under strong positive selection in zebra finches as compared to chicken, a non-vocal learning avian species  <cit> . furthermore, a microarray screening  <cit>  has revealed that specific k-channel transcripts  are differentially expressed in hvc, a nodal nucleus that provides input into the two main pathways in the song system  and is involved in both the acquisition and production of learned song. indeed, intracellular recordings can readily discriminate interneurons and projection neurons within hvc based upon differences in membrane resting potential, input resistance, sub-threshold responses, cell excitability, action potential after-hyperpolarization, and synaptic inhibition  <cit> . nearly all of these properties are likely to be influenced by expression of k-channel genes.

we reasoned that a comprehensive survey of k-channel genes in the zebra finch genome and their expression patterns in the brain would provide important insights into the properties of the circuits for production and maintenance of the adult song, indicating molecular targets for the pharmacological and/or genetic manipulation of singing behavior. starting with the complete complement of k-channel genes in the human genome, we identified  <dig> zebra finch loci that encode either structural components of k-channels , or channel-specific modifiers. our analysis revealed some previously unrecognized k-channel genes that may be unique to non-mammalian vertebrate lineages, as well as others that appear to have been lost in birds or are possibly unique to mammals. we also identified k-channel genes that possess either songbird-specific protein insertions/deletions compared to chicken and mammals, or that are under high selective pressure . finally, in situ hybridization analysis revealed the broad distribution of k-channel genes in the zebra finch brain, as well as molecular specializations of key nuclei of the song system, indicating possible roles for k-channels in production and/or maintenance of adult birdsong. our study represents the first comprehensive analysis of a family of ion channels in an avian genome and identifies molecular components that likely regulate the biophysical and excitable properties of the song control circuitry. more broadly, our demonstrate that a combined genomics and molecular approach can provide compelling evidence for the involvement of specific gene families in the shaping of brain circuits for complex learned behaviors.

RESULTS
potassium channel genes in the zebra finch genome
to identify k-channel genes in the zebra finch genome, we first searched the hgnc gene and family lists  <cit> , as well as the iuphar voltage-gated channel list  <cit>  and defined  <dig> genes representing all identified k-channel genes in the human genome. this set included proteins related to the assembly  or modulation  of k-channels, as well as proteins containing a conserved k-channel-like tetramerization domain thought to modulate the function of gabab receptors  <cit> . we next blat-aligned each human gene model to the zebra finch genome using ucsc’s genome browser  <cit> , and used syntenic analysis to define orthologous loci in chicken and other vertebrate organisms. in several cases, the zebra finch gene model required alignment to additional vertebrate genomes  to verify orthology and/or confirm the presence or absence of the gene at different nodes within the vertebrate lineage. we also consistently blat-aligned each confirmed ortholog back to the zebra finch genome in order to identify additional loci corresponding to duplicated genes and/or paralogs that were not predicted by ensembl genebuild .

our search resulted in the identification of  <dig> distinct genes that we believe correspond to the full complement of k-channel and related genes in the zebra finch genome . this includes members of each of the  <dig> recognized sub-families of k-channel genes, including representatives of the  <dig> transmembrane domain  and calcium-gated channels , the 2tm channels , the 4tm channels , the brain cyclic-nucleotide gated channels , the k-channel tetramerization proteins , and various accessory subunits that are known to co-assemble with and modify the gating properties of k-channels. a total of  <dig> genes have ensembl models that are correctly annotated as 1-to-1 k-channel orthologs in the zebra finch genome compared to humans. an additional  <dig> ensembl models were related to k-channels but had incorrect annotations . these are misidentified as pseudogenes or novel genes, have an incorrect orthology annotation, represent different portions of the same genes, or represent alleles. correction of these errors resulted in the identification of  <dig> additional 1-to- <dig> orthologs compared to humans, and  <dig> additional k-channel genes that are absent in humans. we also identified 4 k-channel genes for which there are currently no predictive ensembl models in zebra finches , consisting of  <dig> additional 1-to- <dig> orthologs and  <dig> more k-channel genes that are absent in humans. together with the  <dig> initial orthologs, these additional  <dig> genes account for 107 k-channel genes in the zebra finch genome,  <dig> being 1-to- <dig> orthologs of human genes.

novel k-channel genes that are absent in humans
seven of the k-channel genes identified in the zebra finch genome  are not defined by hgnc, and could not be found by blat alignments of predicted mrna or protein sequences in the human genome. as detailed below , these genes are to some extent present in avian and/or other vertebrate organisms:

kcnj3l
based on sequence similarity and synteny, partial model enstgug <dig>  is the likely zebra finch kcnj <dig> ortholog . the predicted protein for enstgug <dig> aligns to a second locus on chr <dig> of zebra finch containing enstgug <dig>  annotated as encoding an unidentified protein. this model is most similar to kcnj <dig> based on protein-protein alignment , protein blast searches of genbank databases, and blat alignments against other avian genomes. enstgug <dig> also contains signature motifs of the kcnj sub-family, as well as additional motifs specific to kcnj <dig>  of note, the 5′ end of kcnj <dig> itself is missing in zebra finch, likely due to a gap in genomic sequence. blat alignments and synteny analysis  indicate that an enstgug <dig> ortholog is also present in chicken , lizard  and fish . we found the flanking loci  in human and mouse, but no evidence of a k-channel-related ortholog. thus, this gene is likely a duplication of kcnj <dig> that occurred in teleostomi, but was lost in mammals. we have therefore named this gene kcnj3-like .

kcne1p
the 5′ portion of enstgug <dig>  the zebra finch kcne <dig> ortholog, aligns secondarily to a region ~1 kb downstream of the primary kcne <dig> locus on chr1b_random of zebra finch. this second locus is not separated from kcne <dig> by any gaps in the genomic sequence, has good sequence quality, and shares  <dig> % similarity with kcne <dig> at the amino acid level, but is not predicted by ensembl. the predicted peptide lacks a start codon as well as a portion of the transmembrane domain predicted for kcne <dig>  but does contain two conserved signature domains for kcne-type channels . no transcripts are associated with this locus and there is no evidence of a comparable locus in the corresponding regions of the chicken and human genomes, both of high sequence quality, and without gaps. thus, since this locus likely represents a novel pseudogene in zebra finch that resulted from a duplication of kcne <dig>  we have named it kcne1-pseudogene . we note that this region is flanked by long terminal repeats  and other related repeat elements, suggesting that this gene may have resulted from a retrotransposon-related duplication.

kcnj5/9 l
zebra finch kcnj <dig> and kcnj <dig>  and to a lesser extent kcnj <dig>  additionally align to an alternate zebra finch locus  that is flanked by usp <dig> and ube4a/atp5l and has no ensembl predictions . we have identified orthologs in chicken , lizard  and frog . there is also evidence for an orthologous locus in fish, but the search is complicated by gaps and chromosomal rearrangements. in mouse, ube4a is non-syntenic with usp <dig>  possibly resulting from an intrachromosomal rearrangement. similarly, the human orthologs of ube4a and usp <dig> are rearranged compared to birds, and are found on different chromosomes . in both cases, there is no evidence of any k-channel-related orthologs. the chicken ortholog aligns entirely to the corresponding locus in zebra finch, suggesting that the finch ortholog is also complete, however evidence for mrna expression is only present in chicken. the predicted peptide in zebra finch is conserved compared to chicken and lizard , with the exception of a  <dig> aa chicken-specific insertion  and a  <dig> aa finch-specific insertion , the latter partially altering a protein motif that is specific to inward-rectifying k-channels. the predicted proteins in all three species contain the 6-element protein fingerprint that is present in members of the kcnj inward rectifier k-channel sub-family . additionally, we found 2/ <dig> motifs present in kncj <dig> orthologs, but found that the remaining 3/ <dig> motifs for kcnj <dig>  as well as 6/ <dig> motifs for kcnj <dig>  are predicted to be in protein regions that were included in the partial finch model prediction. low quality sequence and genomic gaps likely prevented the prediction of a more complete model. since this gene had the highest alignment scores to the genomic loci that contained kcnj <dig> or kcnj <dig>  we conclude that this gene is likely a duplication of kcnj <dig> or kcnj <dig> that possibly occurred in euteleostomi, but was lost in mammals, and we propose naming it kcnj5/9-like .

kcnk16l
enstgug <dig> on chr <dig>  aligns to a secondary locus  where no gene model is predicted. blat alignments and partial synteny  define corresponding loci in lizard, chicken, and human, which are also annotated as kcnk <dig>  thus, the secondary alignment of enstgug <dig> on chr <dig> appears to identify the true zebra finch ortholog of kcnk <dig>  due to an apparent chromosomal rearrangement, the genes immediately upstream of kcnk <dig> in zebra finch  are different from those found in lizard, chicken, and human, where kif <dig> is present. of note, this rearrangement in zebra finch may have important implications for the kcnk <dig> promoter. enstgug <dig> itself appears to be a duplicate of kcnk <dig> that is orthologous to genes found in chicken , lizard , and frog , each annotated as novel, hypothetical protein, or protein fragment . among mammals, orthologs were found in platypus , horse  and cow , but were notably absent in rodents and primates, including humans. we also were unable to find an ortholog in fish. a fingerprint scan analysis of the predicted proteins identified 2/ <dig> motifs that define the kcnk sub-family of two-pore channels, and 3/ <dig> motifs defining the  <dig> members of the task channel sub-family  in lizard, chicken, and finch. in contrast, only 2/ <dig> motifs were found in platypus, and none were found in horse and cow . we conclude that enstgug <dig> is likely a duplication of kcnk <dig> with task channel-like features, which was likely first duplicated in frogs and then lost in the clade containing the supraprimates . we have named it kcnk16-like .

kcnv2l
enstgug <dig>  the zebra finch ortholog of kcnv <dig> , aligns secondarily to a locus on chr <dig> of zebra finch that contains enstgug <dig> . the predicted protein of enstgug <dig> lacks a start codon, but the prediction can be extended based upon an nscan prediction  to include a putative methionine. we have identified likely orthologs  in chicken , frog , and platypus , but not in other mammals, or in lizard, where the syntenic region is missing altogether due to incompleteness of the genome. we note that admp also appears to be missing in other mammals. the models in platypus  and frog , which are annotated as novel proteins, show  <dig> % and  <dig> % amino acid similarity with zebra finch, respectively . predicted proteins in all species analyzed contain 6/ <dig> motifs conserved in kcnv channels  as well as 8/ <dig> protein motifs predicted for voltage-gated kcn channels. by comparison, the ortholog of kcnv <dig> in frog is structurally similar to kcnv2l, possessing 6/ <dig> kcnv and 8/ <dig> kcn conserved motifs . we conclude that enstgug <dig> is likely a duplication of kcnv <dig> in tetrapods, which was retained in monotremes and, along with admp, lost in other mammals. we have named this gene kcnv2-like .

kcnq1l
enstgug <dig>  blat aligns to two loci in the zebra finch genome. the primary locus, on chr <dig> and flanked by trpm <dig> and slc22a <dig>  appears to be the finch kcnq <dig> ortholog as it shares synteny with chicken , lizard , fish , and human  orthologs . the secondary locus on chr1a of zebra finch contains an unannotated model , is flanked by mspr <dig> and cdkn1b, and appears to be conserved in chicken , lizard , and fish , but is absent in mouse and human . in frog, the likely ortholog ensxetg <dig> is partially syntenic . the models in frog  and lizard  show  <dig> % and  <dig> % amino acid similarity with zebra finch, respectively , however we note that the model predicted in finch spans gaps and is located partially in a low quality sequence region. predicted proteins in finch and frog  possess 3/ <dig> motifs that define kcnq-type channels and 5/ <dig> motifs near the carboxy-terminus that collectively define the core signature of the kcnq <dig> sub-family. the 8th motif is partial and the 9th motif is missing, likely due to incomplete protein predictions, and motifs  <dig> and  <dig> may have diverged with possible implications for channel function, or more likely appear altered due to the low quality of sequence used for model prediction. by comparison, the finch ortholog of kcnq <dig> possesses all three kcnq motifs and 8/ <dig> kcnq <dig> motifs located near the carboxy-terminus . thus, this gene  appears to be a duplication of kcnq <dig> that likely occurred in fish, but was lost in mammals possibly due to a chromosomal rearrangement. we have named it kcnq1-like .

kctd12l
two models, enstgug <dig> and enstgug <dig>  are currently annotated as kctd <dig> in zebra finch. enstgug <dig>  is most likely the zebra finch kctd <dig> ortholog, sharing synteny with models in fish , lizard , and humans  . in chicken, enstgug <dig> aligns to a partial locus in the correct syntenic block, which is truncated, possibly due to a chromosomal rearrangement. of note, there is an apparent chromosomal rearrangement in fish that resulted in a duplication of kctd <dig>  and lmo <dig>  on chr <dig>  in contrast, model enstgug <dig> shares synteny with models that are annotated as kctd <dig> in chicken  and lizard  . we also found several loci in fish, and one locus in frog that share sequence similarity with enstgug <dig>  but were unable to confirm orthology due to gaps in the flanking regions. though we were unable to identify an ortholog in humans, ensmusg <dig> in mouse  shares sequence and synteny with enstgug <dig>  we conclude that enstgug <dig> is the finch ortholog of kctd <dig> and that enstgug <dig> represents a duplication of kctd <dig> present in sauropsids and mammals, and possibly in fish and frog, but absent in humans. we suggest annotating the latter kctd12-like .

k-channel genes missing from the zebra finch genome
for  <dig> human k-channel genes we found no evidence of zebra finch orthologs, nor did these yield hits in blastn searches of zebra finch est/cdna databases or tblastn searches of translated peptide databases using query sequences from chicken, lizard, frog, fish and representative mammals. three of the missing genes  are recognized as human pseudogenes, the remaining  <dig> can be classified as follows :

a) missing in zebra finch:  <dig> genes are absent in zebra finch, thus possibly in songbirds, but present in chicken. for kcne1l, on chr <dig> flanked by acxl <dig> and ntx <dig> in chicken, there are no sequence gaps at the corresponding region in zebra finches . thus this gene is clearly missing in zebra finches. as for the other genes, gaps in the genomic sequence at the syntenic locations limit any firm conclusions about gene loss; in some cases the flanking genes in humans are also missing in finches.

b) missing in avian genomes only:  <dig> genes are absent in zebra finch, chicken or turkey genomes, but present in lizard. for most of these, one or more of the flanking genes in lizard, frog, fish and/or mammals are also absent in avian genomes. since the absence of syntenic groups in both avian lineages is unlikely to be entirely explained by gaps in the genomic sequence, we conclude that these genes were probably lost in birds.

c) missing in avian and lizard genomes only:  <dig> genes and their syntenic genes are not present in either birds or lizard, but could be identified in frog. although we cannot exclude the possibility that orthologs might be present within genomic sequence gaps, it seems more parsimonious to conclude that they were lost in sauropsids.

d) missing in avian, lizard and frog genomes:  <dig> genes could not be found in birds, lizard or frog, and thus either represent an even more basal loss in tetrapods, or genes that are unique to mammals or subgroups therein. in fish, genes annotated as kcnk <dig> and kctd <dig> map to very different syntenic regions from mammals, and thus are likely to represent independent duplications of related paralogs.

allelic variants of k-channel genes in zebra finches
several k-channel genes had secondary high-scoring alignments outside the main genomic assembly of zebra finch, thus potentially representing allelic variants . to identify variants that might affect peptide structure/function, we examined secondary alignments more closely by using only the predicted peptide of each k-channel ortholog in zebra finch as queries in the blat searches. we only considered alignments to regions of high quality sequence and that had >95% identity to the query, ignoring cases where the ensembl model itself was from a region of poor sequence quality . this restrictive search may have missed variants, but it is unlikely that the variants detected represent sequence errors.

we identified 12 k-channel genes had secondary alignments that meet the criteria above . almost all of these alignments were present on a chr_unkown or, in rare cases on a known chromosome but within a short region flanked by gaps, making it unlikely they represent duplicated genes. they typically consisted of short aligned segments representing one to a few exons at 90-99% nucleotide identity with the ensembl model and containing  <dig>  substitution per exon. while the majority of substitutions were synonymous, one was conservative , and three non-conservative .

unique features of protein coding domains of k-channel genes in zebra finches
to identify insertions/deletions in k-channel genes of zebra finches, we aligned the coding sequences of the zebra finch and chicken k-channel orthologs using clustalw and searched for segments that are absent in chicken or zebra finch sequences. we note that we excluded from this analysis cases where a given segment was misaligned due to a poor model prediction, predictions based on low quality sequence, and/or genomic gaps that affected protein prediction. we identified  <dig> genes containing features that appeared to be different between zebra finch and chicken . although for the majority of genes  these features occurred within regions that contain no domain prediction, kcna <dig> has a finch specific deletion of ‘ng’ at position  <dig> that occurs within an ion transport domain, and kcna <dig> has three different 1– <dig> amino acid insertions and deletions that occur within a predicted tetramerization domain and the ion transport domain, thus possibly affecting these protein functions.

k-channel genes under high selective pressure in zebra finch
some k-channels have been suggested to be under high selective pressure in songbirds, based on dn/ds ratios in comparison with chicken  <cit> . to further determine whether additional k-channel genes might also be under high selective pressure, we first compiled dn/ds ratios for all 100 k-channel genes that had orthologs in chicken based on an ensembl summary of gene orthologs. we then calculated the average value for this set of ortholog pairs  and identified  <dig> genes that had particularly high dn/ds ratios as compared to the group average . however, careful analysis revealed that more than half of these high dn/ds genes , including one gene previously reported as being under positive selection , had artificially high values resulting from improperly aligned protein coding models, incomplete model predictions, and/or models derived from low quality sequence. we therefore verified and recalculated dn/ds values as necessary for each gene using segments of high quality sequence and visual confirmation of protein alignments . after establishing a revised average dn/ds  and a new cut-off value , we were able to confirm that  <dig> out of the original  <dig> genes , as well as  <dig> additional genes  have high dn/ds ratios as compared to the group . we note that these  <dig> cases cannot be explained by low sequence quality or genomic gaps. out of these,  <dig> were found to have substitutions within regions with no predicted functional domains, while  <dig> others have substitutions within a predicted transmembrane domain , an ion transport domain , and/or a tetramerization domain that facilitates alpha subunit assembly . to determine whether the  <dig> genes with changes that could affect channel function are diverging faster in chicken or finch, we next examined the dn/ds ratio values for chicken and finch versus lizard . we found that two genes  appear to be more rapidly evolving in the zebra finch lineage,  <dig> genes  are evolving more rapidly in chicken, and  <dig>  is more rapidly evolving in birds. while the implications of these changes in coding sequences are unclear, since these genes differ between chicken and finch it is not unreasonable to predict that they might be associated with specific passerine vs. galliform traits, including vocal-learning. while simplistic, the genomes of several avian species are currently being sequenced and should allow future investigators an opportunity to conduct a more detailed and precise analysis of genes that are under high selective in various avian lineages.

brain distribution and differential expression of k-channel genes in the song system
of the  <dig> genes we identified as k-channel genes in zebra finches, we found direct evidence of brain expression for  <dig> . evidence primarily consisted of the presence of representative clones  from zebra finch brain transcriptome collections  <cit> . the  <dig> remaining genes are not represented in the current cdna databases and thus may be expressed at low levels in the brain, and/or primarily expressed in non-neuronal tissues. in situ hybridization confirmed that ~85%  genes for which we were able to obtain riboprobes are expressed in the brain. since our main interest was the identification of k-channels that may be involved in some aspect of singing or vocal plasticity, we focus our analysis here on genes that we found to be expressed in the major telencephalic song nuclei of adult males . a more comprehensive report of the brain-wide expression of k-channel genes in zebra finches will be presented elsewhere.

the vast majority of k-channel genes detected by in situ  were found to be expressed in at least one of the major song control nuclei, at variable levels . thus, a large number of genes may be involved in the neural control of birdsong. more than half of these  were differentially expressed in one or more song nuclei relative to the surrounding areas, and most major k-channel gene sub-families had at least one member that showed differential expression in the song system. these genes appear to represent a specific subset of regulatory targets that could influence song learning and vocal plasticity due to their differential expression in the anterior forebrain pathway , and/or contribute to the maintenance or production of learned song based on their differential expression in the direct motor pathway . a summary of their differential expression is presented in table  <dig> .

k-channel differential expression in the anterior forebrain pathway 
we identified 20 k-channel genes with differential  expression in lman and/or area x compared to the surrounding brain region, including some of the most striking examples of differential expression in this gene family in the song system . for example, kcnab <dig> , which encodes a protein that modulates kcna <dig>  and kcna <dig> itself , had high expression in lman, but relatively low expression in nidopallium. in contrast, kcns <dig> , a potent modulator of the kcnb channel sub-family, showed a nearly opposite pattern of expression, and exhibited little or no expression in lman. similarly, kcnt <dig> and kctd <dig> showed elevated expression in area x , while kcna <dig> showed low expression in this nucleus, but strong expression in the surrounding striatum . some k-channels had distributions suggestive of cell type specific regulation. kcnc <dig> , for example, which was not found to be differential in area x or lman, and to some extent kcnab <dig>  were both found to label a sparse population of cells that are broadly distributed throughout the striatum, including area x. given this distribution, it seems reasonable to conclude that kcnc <dig> and kcnab <dig> are expressed in a subset of striatal neurons. although we did not conduct a systemic analysis of k-channel expression in auditory brain areas, or in the medial part of the dorsolateral nucleus of the anterior thalamus , the thalamic nucleus that completes the cortico-striatal-thalamocortical afb loop , we note that some genes were differentially expressed in these brain nuclei. for example, kcna <dig> and one of its accessory subunits, kcnab <dig> are strongly expressed in both dlm, and in an adjacent auditory nucleus, ovoidalis . notably, while kcna <dig> expressing cells are distributed throughout dlm, those expressing kcna1b are more tightly clustered within the core region of dlm. in contrast, kcnh <dig>  which shows little to no expression in dlm, is highly expressed in ov .

k-channel differential expression in the direct motor pathway
we identified  <dig> different k-channel genes with higher or lower expression in hvc and/or ra as compared to their surrounding brain subdivisions ; typical examples are presented in figure  <dig>  within hvc, a number of genes, including kcnab <dig>  kcnab <dig>  and kcnk <dig>  showed varying degrees of elevated expression. similarly, in ra, genes such as kcnab <dig>  and kcns <dig>  showed markedly high expression, the latter providing a remarkably clear definition of the nuclear boundary of ra. notably, the relative distributions and size of the neurons labeled by kcnab <dig> and kcns <dig> suggests that some genes may be specific markers of unique cell types in ra. in contrast, other k-channels such as kctd <dig> were expressed within the arcopallium, but showed low or even absent expression in ra .

members of the kcna sub-family of k-channels are differentially expressed in the song system
k-channel genes can be grouped into sub-families based on their phylogenetic relatedness  <cit> . our analysis indicates that multiple members of the same sub-family can show differential overlapping and non-overlapping patterns of expression in the song system. one prominent example was the kcna sub-family of delayed rectifier k-channels, and their associated beta subunits . out of the  <dig> kcna and  <dig> kcnab channels for which we were able to derive riboprobes, kcna <dig> showed strong enrichment in hvc  and lman , as well as weaker enrichment in area x . in contrast, kcna <dig> and kcna <dig> were found to be expressed but not differential in the song system, whereas kcna <dig>  despite being strongly expressed in striatum, was expressed at very low levels in area x . kcnab <dig> and kcnab <dig>  genes which encode the two known accessory subunits of kcna-type channels, both showed strong expression in the pallial song nuclei hvc, ra, and lman , but very different patterns in the striatum and area x. specifically, kcnab <dig> was highly expressed throughout the striatum, including area x, while kcnab <dig> expression was sparse, suggesting that it might be marker of a distinct striatal or possibly pallidal cell type.

evidence for the differential expression of duplicated genes in the songbird brain
in a few cases, we found that a pair of duplicated genes had different patterns of expression in the songbird brain. for instance, kctd <dig> showed expression in most major brain subdivisions, but had low expression in pallial song nuclei , and high in striatal area x . in contrast, kctd12l, a likely duplication of kctd <dig> that is apparently missing in mammals, was barely detectable in most of the brain, but strongly expressed in a very discrete small cell type in the mesopallium , as well as in the medial habenula . kctd <dig> had only sparse labeling in lateral, and no expression in medial habenula . kcnj <dig> showed expression throughout the brain, including in various neuronal and glial cell types in the ventricle, white matter, and fiber tracts . in contrast, kcnj3l, an apparent duplication of kcnj <dig> that is missing in mammals, was detectable at relatively low levels throughout the brain, but was highly enriched in the ventral tegmental area  and possibly part of substantia nigra . these findings point to marked specializations between closely related genes  in terms of brain areas where they are active, and suggest corresponding differences in transcription regulatory domains within their promoters.

discussion
we have applied a comprehensive genome analysis strategy to identify the full complement of k-channels and related genes in the zebra finch genome, and in situ hybridization to determine their brain expression, focusing on nuclei involved in birdsong production and learning. we chose humans as a starting point for k-channel identification because they possess the largest and most completely described set of k-channel genes. furthermore, songbirds and humans share vocal learning, a rare trait that requires specialized vocal control brain structures that have been identified in both species. our analysis revealed that a very large cohort of human k-channel genes is also present in zebra finches, supporting a high degree of conservation across the two species, but we also identified several human genes that are missing in finches and some novel k-channel genes that are present in finches but absent in humans, most of the latter representing conserved genes in non-mammalian vertebrates. strikingly, nearly every major k-channel sub-family  had at least one gene member that showed some degree of differential expression  within a song nucleus compared to its surround, supporting the notion that targeted gene regulation within this family may help shape the differential biophysical and excitable properties of vocal control areas in songbirds. here we discuss the implications of our findings in the context of songbird biology and the evolution of circuitry for learned vocalizations.

an improved approach for identifying orthologous gene sets
in spite of a completed draft genome assembly, well-curated sets of orthologous genes are not yet available in zebra finches. our approach to identify the full complement of k-channel genes in the current finch assembly consisted of first compiling a list of all protein coding genes recognized as k-channels in humans, then blat-aligning the predicted protein sequences to the genome assemblies of zebra finches and other vertebrates of comparative interest, followed by orthology confirmation through synteny analysis. this approach allowed us to determine which subset of k-channel orthologs in zebra finches are correctly annotated by ensembl, but also to identify and correct several erroneously annotated models, and some relevant loci with no predicted models. most of the latter are in regions of low quality sequence that also contain large or several sequence gaps, often interrupting open reading frames. our analysis also helped to confirm and/or establish several gene gains or losses within the vertebrate phylogeny. we are confident to have identified the full complement of k-channel genes in the current finch assembly, since we systematically re-blat-aligned every identified finch locus to the finch genome, to ensure no loci were being missed due to low cross-species sequence conservation. this was important as some unannotated loci could only be detected through alignments to other members of the same sub-family. we believe our approach provides a highly sensitive strategy for retrieving full ortholog sets, especially from low-coverage genomes.

in search of finch-specific genomic features of k-channel genes
the dramatic radiation of k-channel genes in vertebrates, likely the result of ancient whole genome and chromosome duplications, as well as wholesale rearrangements  <cit> , may have played a role in the rapid evolution of brain structures specialized for complex behaviors, including vocal learning. at the level of individual genes, changes affecting gene function may have included mutations, insertions and/or deletions in protein-coding sequences, changes in cis- and trans-regulatory domains, and even wholesale gene duplications/deletions. one of our goals was to determine whether the k-channel gene family possesses features that are conserved in zebra finches  and humans, thus pointing to possible physiological requirements associated with vocal production and learning. specifically, we reasoned that we might find evidence for conserved k-channel gene duplications/expansions, and/or protein coding insertions/deletions in zebra finches and humans, but absent in vocal non-learning mammals and birds .

consistent with our hypothesis, we found that finches and humans share the vast majority of protein coding k-channel genes, including representatives from each of the  <dig> major k-channel sub-families . furthermore, of the  <dig> human genes that appear to be missing in finches,  <dig> represent pseudogenes that likely do not influence cell physiology, and  <dig> may have been undetected in finches due to gaps in the current assembly. thus out of  <dig> human k-channel genes, only  <dig>  appear to be actually missing in songbirds, indicating a high degree of conservation in this gene family between these two greatly divergent species of vocal learners. moreover, based upon consultation to the allen mouse atlas of brain gene expression  <cit> ,  <dig> of these  do not appear to be expressed in the mammalian brain,  <dig>  are widely expressed throughout the brain, suggesting a general functional role, and  <dig>  exhibit regionalized expression that largely overlaps with that of other members of these sub-families, suggesting functional redundancy in their brain distributions. thus, it appears that the majority of genes that are missing in songbirds , are either not expressed in the brain, or have redundant functions with other family members that are present in birds.

despite the apparent conservation among vocal learners, we also discovered that the complement of k-channel genes is highly conserved between zebra finch and chicken, the latter species being incapable of vocal learning. for instance, we found just a single finch gene, kcne1p that is absent in chicken, and since it is a pseudogene, it is not expected to influence neuronal excitability. in fact, nearly every novel k-channel gene in finch that is absent in humans is present in chicken and/or other vertebrate taxa, suggesting that many of these genes represent relatively ancient gene duplications that were likely lost in some or in all mammals . thus, it seems unlikely that k-channel gene duplication events have played a prominent role in the evolution of neural circuitry for learned vocalizations. we next looked for evidence of protein coding insertions/deletions  that might change the function of channels in zebra finches as compared to chickens. intriguingly, we identified 16 k-channel genes that contain finch-specific indels within their predicted protein coding domains. however, only two of these k-channels  had indels within a region containing a predicted functional domain, and in both cases this region is quite variable across taxa . therefore, it seems unlikely that these amino acid substitutions are likely to affect channel function. finally, our analysis was able to confirm and extend the observation that some k-channel genes are under high selective pressure in finch compared to chicken  <cit> . we note that our analysis also revealed that nearly half of all k-channel genes that could be inferred to have high dn/ds ratios based on ensembl compara are incorrect, and have artificially high dn/ds ratios that stem from improperly aligned protein coding models, incomplete model predictions, and/or models derived from low quality sequence. interestingly, our analysis revealed that of the  <dig> genes with relatively high dn/ds ratios,  <dig> are members of the kcnk family of 2-tm channels, corresponding to half of all kcnk channels under high selective pressure in zebra finch. we note that this finding is not due to the disproportionate number of kcnk channels in the zebra finch genome, as the kctd family, the largest family of k-channel related genes, contains  <dig> members and just a single gene  under high selective pressure compared to chicken. while the implications of this finding are unclear, they do suggest that specific families of k-channels may play a more prominent role in the evolution of zebra finches, and/or possibly the songbird lineage. it will be interesting to see if this remains the case for other members of the songbird clade as additional genome sequences become available . in any case, further analysis revealed just  <dig> cases where non-conservative amino acid substitutions might be expected to affect a predicted functional domain, and in just two cases , we found that the dn/ds ratio comparing lizard vs. finch was higher than that of lizard vs. chicken, suggesting greater divergence in songbirds. thus, overall, it appears that k-channel genes are highly conserved among higher vertebrate lineages. it thus seems unlikely that the genomic features we have described for the k-channel gene family in zebra finches, including novel genes or protein coding changes, are prominent mechanisms for tailoring the functional properties of circuitry for vocal production and maintenance.

as discussed next, we found strong evidence for the differential expression of k-channel genes in song control nuclei. a comparable characterization of k-channel expression in brain areas associated with speech and language  is lacking in humans, thus we cannot at present assess the degree of brain gene expression conservation across vocal learners. however, none of the detected song nuclei marker genes are specific to finches. these observations suggest that the specific properties conferred by k-channel genes on vocal circuitry are most likely determined at the level of transcriptional regulation, pointing to promoter regulatory regions as critical elements to be examined in future studies.

functional tuning of brain circuits for the production and maintenance of learned vocalizations
consistent with our expectations based on the function of k-channels and their widespread expression in the mammalian brain  <cit> , we found evidence for the expression of k-channel genes encoding pore-forming  and accessory  subunits in every major song nucleus in the adult zebra finch brain . in fact, only  <dig> genes for which we had probes, and were able to detect signal, appear not to be expressed in the song system. thus, it is possible that combinatorial patterns define the molecular constituents of k-channels within song nuclei, forming a gene network that defines the homeostatic  as well as dynamic states  of neurons that influence the maintenance and production of adult birdsong. however, we also found that more than half of all k-channel genes  are differentially expressed  in at least one vocal nucleus relative to its surrounding brain region. these genes constitute molecular markers of the song system, and they may underlie the unique electrophysiological features that define the properties of neurons in vocal nuclei. a deeper understanding of the roles that these k-channel markers play in other systems may provide important insights into the cellular properties, firing behavior, and state dynamics of vocal control pathways.

k-channel specializations in an anterior forebrain pathway  for vocal plasticity
while lesions of afp nuclei do not affect adult song per se, they do suppress song learning and reduce vocal plasticity, implicating the afp as a key player in the sensorimotor learning and maintenance of birdsong. a major finding of the present study is the identification of a large number of k-channel genes  that are specifically differentially expressed in the afp . the selective expression of these genes in the afp suggests they may confer specialized electrophysiological features that are central for song learning and vocal plasticity.

area x is located within the avian equivalent of the basal ganglia, but intriguingly it contains cells that present both striatal- and pallidal-like properties, based on anatomical, molecular, and neurophysiological criteria  <cit> . area x receives primary input from lman, and in turn projects to dlm in the thalamus. while lesions of lman result in impoverished, but highly stereotyped adult song  <cit> , partial lesions in area x lead to abnormal, un-crystallized, and structurally variable song  <cit> . thus, these nuclei serve functionally distinct roles during song learning. it seems reasonable to assume that these areas possess electrophysiological distinct properties, possibly related to k-channel expression. indeed, we found that 9 k-channel genes are strong markers of area x,  <dig> of lman, and  <dig> of both. notably, kcnab <dig> , kcna <dig> , and kcnt <dig>  are among the strongest and most selective markers that we have found to date for lman and area x, from a database of several hundred genes, hinting that these channels likely confer specific properties that are important for a functioning adult song system.

some identified k-channels markers of area x have previously been linked to sensory and motor functions in mammalian systems. for example, kcnt <dig>  which encodes a unique class of na+-sensitive k-channels ), is widely expressed throughout brainstem auditory nuclei in mammals, where it is thought to regulate the accuracy of neuronal spike timing  <cit> . intriguingly, both singing- and auditory-related activity have been reported in area x  <cit> , suggesting that kcnt <dig> might play a role in stabilizing, or locking-in, the fidelity of song-related firing patterns in area x. notably, area x was also the only song nucleus showing higher differential levels of mrna for a member of the kcnk sub-family of two-pore leak channels . this is intriguing as kcnk <dig> is the only member of this sub-family that is capable of reversibly interconverting from an open leak channel to a voltage-dependent phenotype depending on the state of phosphorylation  <cit> . its high expression in area x suggests an underlying mechanism for regulating resting membrane potential, which would have important consequences for shaping cellular excitability  <cit> . pharmacological and double-labeling studies will be needed to address what cell types these channels are expressed in, whether/how they may interact, and how the properties of individual neurons work together to establish the underlying properties of area x.

our in situ data also reveal that multiple members of the same k-channel sub-family are co-expressed within the same nucleus, and possibly even cell type, suggesting that the combined properties conferred by these channels may be important for normal function. in area x, two members of the g-protein coupled inward rectifying k-channel  sub-family  are highly expressed . this is noteworthy, as girk channels are known to be activated by a variety of g-protein coupled receptors, including several shown to be expressed in area x. for instance, d <dig> dopamine receptors are expressed in area x  <cit>  and are thought to be key players in the dopaminergic modulation of social-context dependent song learning  <cit> . furthermore, d <dig> receptor activation dampens singing-related increases of egr <dig>  expression  <cit> , and depresses evoked firing  <cit> , responses that are consistent with the activation of irk-type channels in other g-protein coupled pathways. we thus suggest that girk activation by d <dig> may represent a mechanism for modulating the properties of area x neurons, a testable hypothesis that illustrates how molecular findings can help guide targeted pharmacological and electrophysiological studies.

lman’s core region contains magnocellular neurons that send dual projections to area x and ra, as well as gabaergic neurons that influence the projection neurons through inhibition  <cit> . the magnocellular neurons are of particular interest since they provide direct input to the afp via area x, and the dmp via ra. our analysis revealed that some k-channel specializations distinguish lman from other song nuclei, including  <dig> of  <dig> of the kcnc sub-family members  for which we had probe. interestingly, we found that kcnc <dig>  which is prominently expressed in the brain of mammals, has been lost in birds, possibly amplifying the relative contributions of the remaining members of this channel sub-family. in mammals, kcnc-expressing neurons can be readily distinguished from other cells by their high-frequency firing, unique narrow spike waveform  <cit> , and in some cases, expression of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin. intracellular recordings suggest that the fast gating kinetics conferred by kcnc channels are critical for maintaining high-frequency repetitive firing  <cit> , leading some to argue that virtually every neuron that is capable of sustained firing likely expresses at least one kcnc type. while few intracellular studies have been conducted on the intrinsic properties of neurons in lman, the presence of parvalbumin expression in both parvocellular and magnocellular neurons  predicts that kcnc channels may define the fast-spiking properties of both cell types in lman.

k-channel specializations in a direct motor pathway  for singing
lesions of hvc or ra abolish singing, indicating that the dmp provides the neural instructions or motor code for the production of learned song . while the exact nature of this code is unclear, the available evidence suggests a hierarchical organization with:  pre-motor hvc-to-ra neurons that burst sparsely during each song motif, thus apparently linked to the tempo of song, projecting to  ra neurons that fire repeatedly throughout the song, but in synchrony with temporal and spectral features of song syllables  <cit> . given that these processes likely require very different cellular firing properties, we were not surprised to find major differences in k-channel complements in hvc and ra. indeed, out of the 27 k-channel genes identified as markers of the dmp,  <dig> were exclusive to hvc, and  <dig> to ra.

we found that genes related to assembly of delayed rectifier voltage-gated channels are highly differential in hvc , but generally weakly expressed or negatively differential in ra . this is intriguing as when kcna subunits are paired with kcnab <dig> or kcnab <dig>  both of which are also elevated in hvc, the resulting inactivation gating properties become particularly suited for enhancing spike accommodation, broadening action potentials, and delaying spike after-hyperpolarizations  <cit> . hvc contains at least three distinct classes of neurons, namely neurons that project to area x and ra , and local gabaergic interneurons , importantly, hvcra neurons, the specific cell type that participates in pre-motor projection to vocal-motor nucleus ra, exhibit strong spike accommodation  <cit> , a property that may underlie the sparse coding characteristic of this projection and that may be at least partially explained by the molecular profile we have found in hvc. we note the differential expression of kcna channel subunits has been associated with the production of specific motor patterns in other systems. for example, in the lobster stomatogastric system, variation in k-current properties of pyloric neurons, which result from the differential expression of kcna and kcnb subunits, has been shown to determine the firing order and phase relationships between circuit components, thus leading to the production of different motor patterns . in the song system, future double-labeling studies to determine the cell type specific complement of k-channel genes, and the ability to block specific channel genes through pharmacology or molecular methods may provide novel insights into how specific k-channels help to determine the physiology of hvc.

in contrast with hvc, virtually every k-channel gene that is exclusively differential in ra showed relatively low expression, including both k channel subunits , both kcnt channels, and a variety of kcnb and kcnd accessory subunits. these results suggest an emphasis on stabilizing neuronal networks within ra, possibly related to the preservation the low song-to-song syllable variability in firing properties that has been observed in most ra neurons  <cit> . interestingly, recordings from ra neurons in both anesthetized in vivo and in vitro slice preparations indicate that these neurons act like intrinsic pacemaker cells, often displaying extremely high rates of spontaneous activity  <cit> . this is in stark contrast with hvc neurons , which are relatively quiescent unless stimulated by current injection  <cit> . thus, one explanation for the apparent decreased level of k-channel mrna expression in ra is the suppression of specific k-channel variants , depressing rapid changes in cellular excitability and firing adaptation.

CONCLUSIONS
one of the largest and most structurally diverse families of ion-selective channels in vertebrates, k-channels participate in a wide array of neuronal functions, ranging from resting membrane potential and intrinsic excitability to action potential repolarization and synaptic plasticity. our genomics and in situ analyses have shed new light on a rich diversity of molecular components that are highly likely to shape biophysical and excitable properties of neurons in the songbird brain. our findings indicate that k-channels are expressed in various combinations in the song system, and point to specific genes that may play instrumental roles in the specialized physiological properties of individual song nuclei. this suite of k-channels provides a battery of new targets for future research utilizing pharmacological and genetic techniques to manipulate brain nuclei, functional circuits, or even specific cell types. understanding how these channels shape the properties of the song control circuitry will go a long ways towards improving our understanding of the neuronal requirements for vocal learning in songbirds and other vocal learners.
