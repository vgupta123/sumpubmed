BACKGROUND
problems of data organization and data clustering are prevalent across a number of different disciplines. these areas include pattern recognition  <cit> , image processing  <cit> , information retrieval  <cit> , microarray gene expression  <cit> , and protein structure prediction  <cit> , just to name a few. the goal of data clustering, regardless of the application, is to organize data in such a way that objects which exhibit "similar" attributes are grouped together. the definition of similarity depends on the application and may correspond to the direct comparison of values or the degree of correlation among trends or patterns of values.

several methods have been proposed for the clustering of large-scale, dense data. the most common approaches to the data clustering problem are typically categorized as hierarchical  <cit>  or partitioning  <cit>  clustering. although algorithms to identify the optimal solutions to these categories of problems do exist  <cit> , they are frequently solved using heuristic search techniques that result in suboptimal clusters because the comparisons between terms are evaluated locally. various other frameworks for data clustering have been proposed, including model-based clustering  <cit> , neural networks  <cit> , simulated annealing  <cit> , genetic algorithms  <cit> , information-based clustering  <cit> , decomposition based approaches  <cit> , and data classification  <cit> . the field of rearrangement clustering has emerged as an effective technique for optimally minimizing the sum of the pairwise distances between rearranged rows and columns. the bond energy algorithm  was originally proposed as a method for finding "good" solutions to this problem  <cit>  and it was subsequently discovered that this problem could be formulated as a traveling salesman problem  which can be solved to optimality  <cit>  using existing methods.

if a gene is involved in more than one biological process or belongs to a group of genes that are coexpressed under limited conditions, then alternative cluster definitions and clustering techniques are required  <cit> . a bicluster is defined as a submatrix which spans a certain set of genes  and certain set of conditions . common elements can be shared among biclusters and there is no requirement that all members of the original matrix are classified in a bicluster. several different models and algorithms have been developed for this np-hard problem  <cit> . to generate biclusters within a reasonable amount of time, many existing techniques either employ heuristic methods for generating good solutions or simplify the problem representation, such as discretizing the expression level.

the cheng and church  <cit>  and cmonkey  <cit>  biclustering algorithms are iterative processes and allow for integration of other data types since they do not transform the data. the cheng and church algorithm uses a greedy heuristic to solve an optimization problem based on the mean square residue, which provides a measure of deviation from the actual value of an element and its expected value based on the row, column, and bicluster mean  <cit> . other methods for biclustering, such as plaid  <cit>  and spectra models  <cit> , are related to projection methods which regenerate the data matrix by biclusters. the plaid model expresses the value of each element in the gene expression data as a series of additive layers  <cit>  and the spectra model uses singular value decomposition to identify eigenvectors that reveal the existence of checkerboard structures within the rearranged genes and conditions  <cit> . another matrix factorization based method, nsnmf  <cit> , utilizes non negative matrix factorization with non-smoothness constraints to identify block-structures  in gene expression data for a given factorization rank. in contrast to the plaid model, which focuses on the uniformity of expression levels, biclusters defined by order-preserving submatrices focus on the relative order of the columns  <cit>  in an attempt to identify biclusters with coherent evolutions. the biclustering methods bimax  <cit>  and samba  <cit>  discretize the expression level which allows them to enumerate a large number of biclusters in less time than more complicated models. to complement the assortment of problem representations for biclustering, there have been a variety of algorithmic approaches developed to solve these models of varying complexity, such as zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams  <cit> , evolutionary algorithms  <cit> , markov chain monte carlo  <cit> , bipartite graphs  <cit> , and 0â€“ <dig> fractional programming  <cit> . an excellent review of different bicluster definitions and biclustering algorithms can be found in  <cit> .

in this article, we introduce a biclustering algorithm which iteratively utilizes optimal re-ordering to cluster the rows and columns of dense data matrices in systems biology. we present several objective functions to guide the rearrangement of the data and two different mathematical models  to perform the row and column permutations of the original data matrix. we demonstrate that this global optimization method provides a closer grouping of interrelated entities than other clustering and biclustering algorithms, produces clusters with insightful molecular functions, and can reconstruct underlying fundamental patterns in the data for several distinct sets of data matrices arising in important biological applications.

RESULTS
in this section, we present the results for our proposed biclustering method for a variety of interesting systems. we first demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by analyzing systems that can be manually or visually assessed. for this purpose, we chose to examine  a small data matrix consisting of metabolite concentration data and  an image reconstruction problem, which allows for visual inspection of the results. we then apply the proposed methodology to larger systems corresponding to  synthetic data with implanted biclusters and gene expression data for  colon cancer data,  breast cancer data, as well as  yeast segregant data. for each of these data sets, we draw comparisons with several other clustering and biclustering techniques.

case study 1: metabolite concentration data
the proposed method was tested on data comprised of concentration profiles for  <dig> metabolites  recorded over time  for the organisms e. coli and s. cerevisiae under the conditions of nitrogen and carbon starvation for both organisms  <cit> . the concentration changes were dynamically measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. we applied our biclustering algorithm to this data using the objective function defined in eq.  <dig>  the re-ordering problem for the columns was solved to global optimality using the mixed-integer linear programming algorithm in cplex  <cit>  in  <dig>  seconds on an intel  <dig>  ghz pentium  <dig> processor. the optimal ordering for the columns using the objective function in eq.  <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  where the top four cluster partitions for the columns are denoted by the solid vertical lines.

it is interesting to note that the two most significant cluster boundaries perfectly partition subsets of the e. coli and s. cerevisiae conditions. an interesting feature of the column rearragnement is that all the nitrogen starvation conditions occupy one half of the matrix and the carbon starvation conditions occupy the remaining half of the matrix. the regions between these cluster boundaries, labeled a, b, c, d, and e in figure  <dig>  are also optimally re-ordered using the proposed method. for the sake of brevity, let us consider the results obtained from optimally re-ordering the submatrices for region e, as shown in the enlarged regions of figure  <dig>  the submatrix for region e was optimally re-ordered in  <dig>  cpu seconds. the optimally re-ordered metabolites for region e over the conditions of carbon starvation in e. coli yields an excellent grouping of amino acid and tca metabolites. in a cluster of  <dig> metabolites,  <dig> are amino acids  and  <dig> are ordered consecutively: serine, glycine, valine, glutamate, tryptophan, alanine, threonine, and methionine . this richness of amino acid metabolites is consistent with the observation that amino acids tend to accumulate during carbon starvation  <cit> . another interesting feature is that four out of the six tca metabolites  are within six positions of each other in the optimal ordering. the biosynthetic intermediates also order well for this submatrix , where all twelve are placed in the top half of the re-ordered matrix, which is rich in metabolites that are decreasing in concentration. an interesting observation is the final position of fbp relative to phospoenolpyruvate , which are exactly opposite each other in the re-ordered matrix. pep is a positive regulator of pyruvate kinase, which is the major enzyme consuming pep  <cit> . since carbon-starvation resulted in a decrease of fbp, this presumably down-regulates the activity of pyruvate kinase, which in turn results in pep accumulation.

we compared our findings with the results for hierarchical clustering  <cit>  applied to the metabolite concentration data  <cit> . the hierarchical clustering placed the majority of amino acids in the top half of the arranged matrix, with the largest consecutive ordering of amino acids being alanine, glutamate, threonine, methionine, and serine, which is a less significant clustering than those found in region e for oreo. the tca cycle compounds were also not found to be grouped as well for hierarchical clustering as they were for oreo, where four tca cycle compounds  were assigned to a cluster of ten metabolites  <cit> . we also optimally re-ordered the hierarchical clustering leaves using the treearrange algorithm  <cit>  to see if the clustering of related metabolites would improve. the most notable improvement in the results of the optimal leaf ordering are a grouping of  <dig> amino acid metabolites out of  <dig> metabolites  and an ordering where  <dig> biosynthetic intermediate metabolites were found in a span of  <dig> metabolites. overall, when compared to hierarchical clustering, with and without optimal leaf ordering, oreo arranges the metabolites in an order which more closely reflects their known metabolic functions.

the objective function values for eq.  <dig> were evaluated for the final ordering as provided by the hierarchical clustering results and then compared to the optimal values that were determined using our method over all columns and rows . the "gap" column in table  <dig> is a standard measure for quantifying the deviation of an ordering from optimality. based on table  <dig>  the final ordering provided by the hierarchical results, with and without optimal leaf ordering, are suboptimal with respect to the squared difference objective function.

"objf" denotes the objective function for the squared difference metric  and hierarchical clustering , with and without optimal leaf ordering. "hc" corresponds to hierarchical clustering  <cit>  and "hc " corresponds to the optimal leaf ordering of hierarchical clustering using treearrange  <cit> .

case study 1: results and comparisons with other biclustering algorithms
since the rearranged data appears to naturally form biclusters, we compared the results for oreo with the biclustering algorithms isa, cheng and church's, opsm, bimax, samba, and nsnmf on the metabolite concentration data set. each algorithm was run using the default parameter values, which were adjusted in the event that no biclusters were found. the biclustering results were visualized using the bivoc algorithm  <cit>  and are provided along with a complete description of the results obtained for each method .

the best results were reported by cheng and church's algorithm  <cit>  and nsnmf. for cheng and church's algorithm, the best bicluster consisted of  <dig> metabolites, of which  <dig> were assigned to the amino acid category  <cit>  over various conditions related to carbon and nitrogen starvation in e. coli and s. cerevisiae. the longest consecutive ordering of amino acids within this bicluster are serine, methionine, threonine, glutamate, and alanine, which is exactly the same as that reported in the hierarchical clustering results. the majority of the other metabolites in this bicluster are biosynthetic intermediates. the biclustering algorithm nsnmf was applied to the metabolite concentration data set for  <dig> runs using a cophenetic correlation coefficient of k =  <dig>  <cit> . sorting the starvation conditions using the first and second basis metabolites also perfectly separates the nitrogen and carbon starved samples for both basis metabolites, which is consistent with the findings of oreo. when sorting the metabolites using the first basis condition, there is an excellent grouping of  <dig> amino acid metabolites within a span of  <dig> metabolites. the metabolites sorted by the second basis condition did not yield any significant grouping of related metabolites.

case study 2: image reconstruction 
we also applied the proposed method to a data matrix representing an image, commonly referred to as the "lenna image", which has been extensively studied in the image processing community. although the pixels of an image are very different than patterns observed in systems biology data, studying such a matrix allows us to visually assess the ability of the proposed approach. in the experiment presented in  <cit> , the original image, which consists of  <dig> by  <dig> pixels, was elongated by replicating it  <dig> times to create a  <dig>  by  <dig> matrix. the optimal ordering of this replicated image should result in a stretched version of the original image. the results for a memetic algorithm, click, and two other methods based on hierarchical clustering were presented in this study  <cit>  and here we compare our results to these findings. oreo was able to recover the correct ordering for the original image and a subset of the original image . this image was also examined after introducing two types of noise:  modifying every pixel by a random value less than 10% of the maximum pixel intensity  and  assigning a random value between  <dig> and  <dig> to 10% of the pixels . the optimal ordering determined by oreo is presented in figure  <dig>  where we see that we again recover the correct image. the memetic algorithm is able to recover the original image and the agglomerative clustering algorithm performs slightly worse given this noise level, as the misplaced subsection of the image has become larger . as in the case without any noise , the ebi hierarchical clustering algorithm and click chop the original image into many disjunct subsections. although this example does not correspond to biological data, it illustrates the applicability of oreo for other systems.

case study 3: synthetic data with implanted biclusters
we also tested our proposed methodology on a data set corresponding to synthetic gene expression data created by an artificial model  <cit> . in these data sets, both constant and additive biclusters of varying degree of overlap were implanted into a simulated matrix and subjected to different levels of noise. the biclustering methods bimax, isa, samba, cheng and church's, opsm, xmotif, and hierarchical clustering were applied to these data matrices and the results were assessed based on two metrics:  the average bicluster relevance and  the average module recovery, as defined in  <cit> . the average bicluster relevance is a quality measure for the biclusters that are produced by a particular method and the average module recovery is a measure of how well a particular method is at finding all of the implanted biclusters. we applied oreo to the four sets of synthetic data :  non-overlapping constant biclusters,  non-overlapping additive biclusters,  overlapping constant biclusters, and  overlapping additive biclusters, all subjected to varying levels of noise estimated from a normal distribution. the average bicluster relevance and average module recovery were computed for oreo for each of these data sets .

when analyzing the non-overlapping and constant bicluster data sets, the biclusters produced by oreo have a perfect score for average bicluster relevance and average module recovery, as shown in figures s. <dig> and s. <dig>  as can be seen in figure  <dig> in  <cit> , only hierarchical clustering performs as well as oreo for this data set. the biclusters produced by isa have a perfect score for average bicluster relevance but have slightly worse scores for the average module recovery. bimax also scores well for these two metrics, but it is observed in figure  <dig> in  <cit>  that its performance decreases with increasing noise level. the biclusters produced by the other methods do not score very well for this set of synthetic data.

for the non-overlapping and additive bicluster data sets, oreo consistently produces biclusters that have an average bicluster relevance score greater than  <dig>  . in figure  <dig> from  <cit> , it is seen that isa and samba produce biclusters that have almost perfect average bicluster relevance scores. the average bicluster relevance for hierarchical clustering is shown to consistently decrease with increasing noise level for these additive biclusters. in terms of average module recovery, it is seen in figure s. <dig> that oreo again consistently scores above  <dig>  over the varying levels of noise. the average module recovery of bimax and isa are shown to be comparable to that of oreo as observed in figure  <dig> in  <cit> , whereas the other methods do not score as well for the additive biclusters subject to varying degrees of noise. for the data sets corresponding to overlapping constant biclusters, the average bicluster recovery and average module recovery follow similar trends ; the scores initially start at one , slightly fall for overlapping degrees of  <dig> and  <dig> elements, then rise back to a score of one for the overlapping degrees ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> and then finally descend at an overlap degree of  <dig> elements. from figure  <dig> in  <cit> , it is shown that bimax produces biclusters with perfect scores for the average bicluster relevance and average module recovery, samba produces biclusters with perfect scores for average bicluster relevance but significantly poorer scores for average module recovery , and isa performs slightly better than oreo in terms of average bicluster relevance for the data matrices with overlapping degrees of  <dig> and  <dig> elements. it is observed that the remaining methods produce clusters that consistently score less than  <dig> .

when examining the overlapping and additive bicluster data sets, the average bicluster relevance for oreo is slightly higher than  <dig>  on average and the average module recovery is about  <dig>  on average, as shown in figures s. <dig> and s. <dig>  from figure  <dig> in  <cit> , it is seen that bimax produces biclusters that have perfect scores for the average bicluster relevance and average module recovery. samba also performs well for the additive biclusters, with the exception of very low scores  for an overlap degree of  <dig> elements. isa performs comparably to oreo for the average bicluster recovery but is shown to decrease in performance with respect to increasing noise level. the results for hierarchical clustering for the overlapping data sets are shown to be much worse than for the non-overlapping data sets and the remaining biclustering methods consistently yield scores less than  <dig>  in both metrics.

case study 4: colon cancer data
we also tested the proposed method on a standard biclustering sample classification example  <cit>  comprised of gene expression data for  <dig> colon tissue samples,  <dig> of which were normal and  <dig> of which were tumor tissues  <cit> . in the original work by alon et al.  <cit> , the  <dig> genes with the highest minimal intensity across the samples were examined using a deterministic-annealing algorithm  <cit> . two-way clustering was performed on both the genes and the tissue samples and it was found that the algorithm was able to approximately separate the tissues into a normal-rich cluster and a tumor-rich cluster. figure  <dig> illustrates the separation of the tissues into tumor-rich and normal-rich regions, where the tumor tissues are in black and the normal tissues in white. only three normal tissues  were assigned in the tumor-rich tissue region and a total of five tumor tissues  were placed in the normal-rich tissue region . the clustering of the genes revealed a strong correlation among the ribosomal proteins, where a cluster consisting of  <dig> ribosomal proteins was discovered  <cit> . we applied our biclustering method to the same set of  <dig> genes of highest minimal intensity and  <dig> tissue samples using the traveling salesman representation and the objective function defined in eq.  <dig>  the original data was normalized by performing z-normalization over all genes and all tissues. the optimal re-ordering for the tissues  was achieved in a cpu time of  <dig>  seconds. the normal and tumor tissue samples were partitioned into normal-rich and tumor-rich regions based on the largest two cluster boundaries. figure  <dig> illustrates the partitioning of the tumor and normal tissues and the tissue names in the normal- and tumor-rich regions are provided . note that in figure  <dig>  oreo provides the richest grouping of tumor tissues in comparison to all the other methods. overall, these results are consistent with the findings of alon et al. in that n <dig> and n <dig> were incorrectly grouped with the tumor tissues and t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> were incorrectly grouped with the normal tissues . the genes  of the data matrix were then optimally re-ordered over both the corresponding tumor and normal-rich submatrices. to compare our clustering with the results presented in alon et al., we examined the final orderings of the genes related to ribosomal proteins and growth factors. for the tumor-rich submatrix, oreo organized  <dig> out of the  <dig> ests homologous to ribosomal proteins into one dense cluster, which is very similar to the findings of alon et al.  <cit> . interdispersed among the ribosomal protein cluster are  <dig> ests homologous to genes that are related to cell growth, such as elongation factors, which is also consistent with previous findings  <cit> .

the colon cancer data was also examined using hierarchical clustering  <cit> . the genes related to ribosomal proteins were clustered together, but only  <dig> out of the  <dig> were grouped into a larger cluster with  <dig> ests homologous to genes related to cell growth interdispersed throughout. figure  <dig> shows that the separation of normal and tumor tissues was not as consistent for hierarchical clustering, where there are several alternating regions of tumor- and normal-rich tissues. even after optimally re-ordering the hierarchical clustering leaves using treearrange  <cit> , the tumor and normal tissues do not separate into two distinct groupings as shown in figure  <dig>  the clustering of the  <dig> ribosomal proteins and cell growth factors do not change after optimal re-ordering of the leaves. in table  <dig>  we present the deviation from optimality for the ordering reported from hierarchical clustering with reference to the optimal ordering over all columns and rows as determined by our method.

case study 4: results and comparisons with other biclustering algorithms
the biclustering algorithm nsnmf  <cit>  was applied to this data set and the separation of the tissues after sorting on the first and second basis genes are presented in figure  <dig>  where it is shown that both factors fail to separate the normal and tumor tissues into two distinct regions. however, when sorting the genes on the first basis tissue, a cluster of  <dig> ribosomal proteins and  <dig> ests homologous to genes related to cell growth is discovered with a relative grouping similar to that of oreo. we also examined this data set with the biclustering algorithms isa, samba, xmotif, opsm, and cheng and church  using the default parameters of each method. for all of the biclustering methods, we examined the molecular function and biological process enrichment of the corresponding biclusters using the ontology tool onto-express  <cit> , applying a hypergeometric distribution and referencing the calculations by the  <dig> genes analyzed. if the algorithm produced more than  <dig> biclusters, we selected the highest scoring  <dig> or the first  <dig> that were reported if no scores were provided. the ontology results for each of the biclustering methods are available . from the ontology analysis, it was found that oreo uncovers several biclusters that are significantly annotated to the molecular function "structural constituent of ribosome", which corresponds to the aforementioned ribosomal proteins that were the focus of discussion in the alon et al. study. the only other methods that provided biclusters significantly annotated to the molecular function of "structural constituent of ribosome" were nsnmf  and samba.

case study 5: breast cancer data
the proposed biclustering method was also applied to breast cancer data studied by van't veer et al.  <cit> . in this data matrix, the expression level for approximately  <dig>  genes over  <dig> breast cancer tumors were measured. a supervised clustering method was used to determine the optimal number of reporter genes for classification based on prognosis, er status, and brca <dig> germline mutation carriers  <cit> . in this study, it was discovered that about  <dig>  of the most significantly regulated genes across the  <dig> tumor samples, which had at least a two-fold difference and a p-value of less than  <dig>  in five or more samples, were effective in separating er positive from er negative tumor samples. missing data values for this matrix were estimated using the k-nearest neighbors approach  <cit> .

oreo was applied to this set of about  <dig>  significant genes and  <dig> tumor samples and the tumors were re-ordered in  <dig>  cpu seconds. in figure  <dig> it is shown that the column re-ordering for oreo is fairly successful in partitioning the er positive and er negative tumors, with  <dig> er negative tumors assigned to the er positive region and  <dig> er positive tumor assigned in the er negative region. hierarchical clustering  <cit>  was also applied to the same data matrix and the resulting arrangement of the tumors is shown in figure  <dig>  where it is shown that there is a reasonable grouping of the er positive and er negative tumors, but an overall separation is not achieved. however, the partitioning is enhanced after optimally re-ordering the leaves using treearrange, as shown in figure  <dig>  where  <dig> er negative tumors are assigned to the er positive region and  <dig> er positive tumors are assigned in the er negative region. we examined the clustering of the  <dig> optimal er status genes as determined by van't veer et al.  <cit> . on average, oreo required  <dig> cpu seconds to optimally re-order these roughly  <dig>  genes over the resulting biclusters. we then examined the densest clustering of at least  <dig> of these genes for oreo and hierarchical clustering, with and without optimal leaf ordering. in other words, we searched for the smallest size neighborhood of genes in which  <dig> er status genes were found. for oreo,  <dig> of the optimal er status genes were found in a span of only  <dig> genes . for hierarchical clustering, the densest clustering of optimal er status genes was found to be  <dig> within a span of  <dig> genes . however, after optimally re-ordering the leaves, a grouping of  <dig> er status genes was found in a span of only  <dig> genes . table  <dig> illustrates the deviations from optimality for the re-orderings provided by hierarchical clustering, with and without optimal leaf ordering.

case study 5: results and comparisons with other biclustering algorithms
the biclustering algorithm nsnmf  <cit>  was also applied to this data set for  <dig> runs with a cophenetic correlation coefficient of k =  <dig>  the ordering of the tumors after sorting on the first and second basis genes are presented in figure  <dig>  where one can see that the nsnmf algorithm is also fairly successful in partitioning the tumors which exhibit er expression. although the orderings are different for sorting on the two factors, both result in  <dig> er negative tumors assigned to the er positive region and  <dig> er positive tumors assigned in the er negative region. the biclustering methods isa, samba, xmotif, opsm, and cheng and church were applied to this breast cancer data set for comparison using the default parameters . we examined the molecular function and biological enrichment of the corresponding biclusters using onto-express  <cit> , using a hypergeometric distribution and referencing the calculations by the  <dig> genes analyzed . if the algorithm produced more than  <dig> biclusters for this data set, we examined the biological enrichment for the highest scoring  <dig> or the first  <dig> that were reported if no scores were provided. it is observed from the ontology results  that oreo had uncovered biclusters with a significant enrichment for the molecular functions "mhc class ii receptor activity" and "mhc class i receptor activity". it is well-known that mhc proteins are cell-surface glycoproteins that bind peptides within the cell, then bring the peptide to the surface for interaction with t cells, which is part of the mechanism in which the body identifies and responds to foreign antigens. these findings are complemented by several oreo biclusters that are enriched in the biological process "immune response". the only other method which found biclusters annotated to both the molecular process "mhc class i receptor activity" and the biological process "immune response" was opsm. the algorithms nsnmf and samba also identified biclusters annotated to the "immune response" biological process.

evaluation of biclustering results in case studies  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> using standard metrics
to assess the quality of the biclusters produced as a function of the input data, we computed the average correlation among the rows and columns as a function of  the bicluster area ,  the number of rows per bicluster, and  the number of columns per bicluster for the  metabolite concentration data,  colon cancer data, and  breast cancer data sets. the average correlation values for each of these scenarios were computed .

for the average correlation over the bicluster rows as a function of bicluster area , it is observed that opsm consistently produces biclusters with the highest average row correlation values for the smaller bicluster areas. note that in each of these data sets, the average correlation values for opsm are monotonically decreasing as a function of the bicluster area. it is also observed in each of the data sets that oreo produces biclusters that are the largest in area and have average row correlation values ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig> . in the majority of instances, no other biclustering methods produce biclusters comparable to this size. the average row correlation values for the biclusters produced by isa range from  <dig> to  <dig> , with an average row correlation of about  <dig>  over the data sets. the biclusters produced by samba generally have better average row correlation values than isa for a given bicluster area. in particular, samba performs well for the breast cancer data set  and produces many biclusters with row correlation values that range from  <dig>  to  <dig> . for the colon cancer data set, samba produces sizable biclusters that are similar in area to those produced by oreo, but the row correlation values for oreo are consistently higher. cheng and church's algorithm produces biclusters of consistently lower average row correlation values than the other biclustering methods, with the exception of a few biclusters corresponding to the metabolite concentration data set  that have correlation values greater than  <dig> . the aforementioned trends are consisently observed for the average correlation over rows as a function of number of rows for all biclustering methods .

we also examined the average correlation among the bicluster columns as a function of bicluster area, and the results are presented in figures s. <dig>  s. <dig>  and s. <dig>  in contrast to the row correlation as a function of bicluster area, there were no discernable trends for the correlation of columns as a function of bicluster area for opsm. in fact, the average correlation values over the columns are not dominant for opsm as they were for the row correlations, although it typically produces average bicluster column correlation values greater than  <dig> . as previously mentioned, oreo produces biclusters that are much larger than the other biclustering techniques, and it is interesting to note that the average correlation values over the columns for oreo are as large, and in some cases greater, than those found in the smaller biclusters produced by other methods. this observation is consistent when considering the column correlation as a function of the number of bicluster columns, as presented in figures s. <dig>  s. <dig>  and s. <dig>  it should be noted that isa is observed to produce biclusters of substantially greater column correlation than row correlation . however, this is a mathematical artifact since isa produces biclusters that typically contain less than  <dig> columns, as shown in figures s. <dig>  s. <dig>  and s. <dig>  which presents the average column correlation as a function of the number of bicluster columns. the column correlations for the biclusters produced by samba are of varying quality and have a high variation throughout the data sets. one should note that although the bicluster areas for samba and isa are generally consistent, samba consistently has more columns per bicluster than isa, which implies that isa typically contains more rows per bicluster than samba . cheng and church's algorithm yields biclusters whose column correlations are of higher value than its row correlations; note that this observation is not a mathematical artifact of having a small number of columns per bicluster, as it was with isa.

case study 6: yeast segregant gene expression data
the last data set used to test the proposed methodology is comprised of expression data for  <dig> genes subject to  <dig> stress conditions  <cit> . solving such a large-scale data set to optimality is a challenging task. oreo was able to optimally re-order the rows and columns of the matrix according to the objective function defined in eq.  <dig> in approximately  <dig> hours of wall-clock time. hierarchical clustering  <cit>  and nsnmf  <cit>  were also applied to re-order the experiments and genes of this data set and the hierarchical clustering leaves were also optimally re-ordered using treearrange  <cit> . the cophenetic correlation coefficient was computed for nsnmf  <cit>  for factors k =  <dig> through  <dig> and it was found that a rank of four factors resulted in the highest coefficient. we also applied the biclustering algorithms bimax and isa to this data set and neither method was able identify significant biclusters for a variety of search parameters. to assess the biological significance of the re-ordered genes over all conditions, we examined biological processes from a curated gene ontology network for s. cerevisiae  <cit> . to evaluate the biological significance for neighboring genes, we evaluated the average enrichment for each of the  <dig> gene ontology terms over all possible neighborhoods of size l genes in the final ordering. for a specific neighborhood of size l genes, the biological process with the greatest enrichment is defined as the process with the maximum value according to the expression in eq.  <dig> 

  enrichmentÂ ofÂ processÂ k=/lngk/ng 

where nglk denotes the number of genes in a neighborhood of size l for process k, ngk denotes the number of genes for process k in the entire experiment, and ng represents the total number of genes in the experiment. the term in the numerator in eq.  <dig> represents the frequency of genes annotated with a given process, k, over the total number of genes considered, l. the frequency is adjusted for neighborhoods that have poor or random enrichment by subtracting one from the gene frequency. this enrichment is normalized by the term in the denominator, which is the fraction of the total number of genes annotated to process k in the experiment. this form of enrichment was applied to the re-ordered genes in order to fairly represent the contributions of interesting biological processes that are annotated to only a small subset of genes . eq.  <dig> is applied for every process over all possible neighborhoods of genes, where the initial neighborhood of genes is comprised of genes of  <dig> though l in the final ordering and this neighborhood window is incremented by one gene  until the last gene in the final ordering has been reached. the enrichment values in eq.  <dig> are then averaged over the total number of neighborhoods considered. this process is repeated for several gene neighborhood sizes in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> genes and the results comparing our method to hierarchical clustering are shown in figure  <dig> 

one can see from figure  <dig> that oreo achieves about  <dig> percent improvement in enrichment on average over the grouping of genes provided by hierarchical clustering. although the enrichment for hierarchical clustering increases about  <dig> percent on average after applying treearrange to optimally re-order the leaves, it is still notably less than that provided by oreo. it is also shown in figure  <dig> that the orderings provided by nsnmf after  <dig> runs when sorting the genes by either of the four basis conditions does not result in significant enrichment values.

the increased enrichment indicates that genes which are annotated to similar biological processes are arranged closer relative to one another in the final arrangement provided by oreo than for hierarchical clustering, with and without optimal leaf ordering, and nsnmf. when examining the individual process contributions to the average enrichment, we observed that electron transport, translation, hydrogen transport, ribosomal biogenesis/assembly and rrna metabolism were the largest contributors to the overall enrichment value for both oreo and hierarchical clustering. other biological processes of similar enrichment magnitudes for oreo include sulfur metabolism, aldehyde metabolism, carbohydrate transport, and mitochondrial transport, suggesting a better clustering of these genes. the deviations from optimality for the re-orderings provided by hierarchical clustering, with and without optimal leaf ordering, are presented in table  <dig>  we also present the results of our method for another data set consisting of an aggregation of experiments on budding yeast  <cit>  .

CONCLUSIONS
a rigorous method for biclustering based on the optimal re-ordering of dense data matrices, oreo, was presented in this article. the re-ordering of the rows and columns can be accomplished via either a network flow model or a traveling salesman problem representation, where the network flow model can be extended to include more than pairwise interactions. this iterative approach uses cluster boundaries in one dimension to define submatrices that are then optimally re-ordered in the other dimension to generate biclusters. several different objective functions can be used to quantify the degree of similarity between adjacent rows and columns in the final arrangement and the selection of the appropriate metric is left as an option to the user. we compared the results of our method with several clustering and biclustering methods for  metabolite concentration data,  an image matrix,  synthetic data with implanted biclusters, and gene expression data for  colon cancer data,  breast cancer data, and  yeast segregant data. for each of these data sets, our method provides a closer grouping of related metabolites and annotated genes than the other clustering and biclustering algorithms, which suggests that the optimal re-ordering has distinct advantages over a local re-ordering and the simplifying assumptions of biclustering methods. it was also shown that oreo has the ability to separate objects into distinct groups, as was illustrated with the separation of the starvation conditions in the metabolite concentration data and the separation of samples in the colon and breast cancer data sets.
