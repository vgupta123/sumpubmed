BACKGROUND
the control of gene expression plays a central role in nearly all biological processes. transcription initiation is regulated on a number of levels, including modification of epigenetic markers and recruitment of rna polymerase by transcription factors   <cit> . enhancers can be functionally defined as short genomic regions which regulate expression of genes, often over long distances. it is well established that enhancers play a key role in the regulation of gene expression  <cit> . recent developments in sequencing techniques have enabled high-resolution investigation of a wide variety of histone modifications, and their functional annotation  <cit> . enhancers have been shown to be marked by high amounts of the histone modification h3k4me <dig>  <cit> , and recent estimates suggest that several hundred thousand enhancers exist in the human and mouse genomes  <cit> .

however, despite the identification of master regulators in several cell types, and technical advances in molecular biology, much remains obscure. for example, the degree to which cell type-specific enhancers are dependent solely on pioneer factors or master regulators is poorly understood. specific combinations of tfs that bind to enhancers might play key roles in regulating genes involved in biological processes, but which tf combinations control which processes is generally unknown. finally, the dynamics in the binding of regulatory elements following stimulation, as well as the interactions between these elements, have not been well described.

here, we address these issues using myeloid apcs . these cells represent a first line of defence against pathogens as part of the innate immune system, and play a role in the subsequent activation of the adaptive immune system. a number of recent studies have emphasized a central role of the lineage-determining ets family member pu. <dig> in defining cell type-specific enhancers in apcs. binding of pu. <dig>  in combination with a small set of cell type-restricted, lineage-determining factors, is necessary for defining macrophage-specific h3k4me1-marked regions during differentiation, and the binding of pu. <dig> in macrophages co-occurs with the binding of stress-inducible tfs, such as nf-κb and irfs  <cit> . it has also been shown that in terminally differentiated macrophages so-called latent enhancers become bound by stimulus-activated and lineage-determining tfs only after stimulation  <cit> . a similar central role of pu. <dig> as a master regulator defining cell type-specific enhancers and regulating the response to immune stimuli has been shown in dcs  <cit> .

the myeloid apcs analysed in this study present a useful system for integrative analysis since there is an abundance of genome-wide data available for these cells. here, we generated rna-seq data as a measure of gene expression and transcription start site sequencing  data  <cit>  as a measure of transcription initiation events, and analysed it in combination with publicly available chip-seq data for various histone modifications  <cit> ,  <dig> tfs and rna polymerase ii   <cit> . we used these data sets to define enhancers on a genome-wide level, and to carry out a detailed analysis of enhancer-tf interactions. we found that regions with enhancer-like features were bound by a variety of sets of principal tfs. specifically, we found that one class of enhancers was bound even before stimulation by pu. <dig>  c/ebpβ, atf <dig>  irf <dig>  and junb . this class was strongly associated with genes that have induced expression following immune stimulation with lps. after stimulation, the same enhancers were then preferentially bound by activated tfs, such as nf-κb, irfs, and stat family tfs. this suggests that the behaviour of genes after stimulation is, to some degree, already decided by the tfs binding to nearby enhancers before stimulation. on the other hand, we also found a considerable degree of change in tf binding to enhancers after stimulation. one change, the transient loss after lps stimulation of atf <dig> binding at h <dig> enhancers, appears to control a set of early induced genes. our results suggest that such changes might be governed by interactions between activated tfs and principal binding tfs, as well as between proximally located enhancer pairs.

methods
we refer to figure  <dig> for a flowchart of the main steps of this study. below is a detailed description of the steps and results.

acquisition and processing of high-throughput sequencing data
for tss-seq data analysis, we prepared peritoneal exudate cells from c57bl/ <dig> mice  <dig> days after injection with 2ml 4% thioglycolate medium . cells attached on the culture dish were stimulated with  <dig> ng/ml lps from s. minnesota re <dig>  for  <dig> h, followed by the extraction of total rnas with trizol . tss-seq was performed on these rnas using the procedure described in  <cit> . rna-seq data was taken from macrophages at three time points . the short-read sequence archive data are registered in the dna data bank of japan  under accession nos.  and . reads were mapped to the mm <dig> genome using eland  <cit>  and uniquely mapped reads with at most  <dig> mismatches to the reference genome were used for further analysis.

for chip-seq data, public chip-seq reads for h3k4me <dig> , h3k27me <dig> , and h3k4me <dig>  taken from bone marrow-derived macrophages   <cit>  were downloaded from the ncbi gene expression omnibus and mapped to the mm <dig> genome using soap <dig>  <cit> . chip-seq data for pu. <dig> , c/ebpβ , and pol <dig>  was processed in the same way.

classification of genomic regions and definition of enhancer regions
in order to define potentially functional genomic regions from tss-seq and chip-seq for h3k27me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig>  the number of mapped tags in the mouse genome was counted in bins of  <dig> bps in steps of  <dig> bps. for the tss-seq reads this was done in a strand-specific way. the position of mapped chip-seq reads was shifted by  <dig> bp in the 3' direction. significant peaks were detected using a poisson distribution-based p value, using a threshold p value of 1e- <dig>  regions containing significant levels of one or more features were merged if they were less than  <dig> bps separated. the weighted average of ppm reads was used to define the central bin of each region, and the  <dig> bins upstream and downstream of this central bin . regions containing mapped tss-seq reads were oriented so that the majority of tags were located on the "+" strand. we excluded regions containing significant levels of mapped tss-seq reads but lacking any histone modifications. such loci were especially enriched in 3' utr regions, and might represent reads originated by recapping, or by genuine transcription initiation  <cit> . this procedure resulted in  <dig>  genomic regions associated with significant levels of one or more epigenetic or transcriptomic features.

regions were marked as overlapping with tss regions, 5' utrs, 3' utrs, exonic regions, or intronic regions, in this order of preference, if they overlapped with these features based on refseq annotations as available in the ucsc database  <cit> . regions not overlapping with any of these features were marked as intergenic. k- means clustering was used to identify enhancer-like genomic regions according to histone modifications and transcription initiation events .

analysis of tf binding to enhancer regions
genome-wide binding regions of  <dig> tfs  in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells  before and after stimulation with lps  <cit>  were obtained from the genome expression omnibus . we used chip-seq-based peak scores as reported in the original study  <cit> , as an indication of tf binding throughout the genome. for each tf at each available time point, we associated peak scores with the center of the reported peak regions, and assigned them to the corresponding bins of  <dig> bps for all  <dig>  regions defined above. bins not including a peak region center received a score of  <dig> 

the overall binding tendencies of tfs to enhancers was evaluated using the highest peak score assigned to the central  <dig> bins of  <dig> bps . table  <dig> shows the percentage of enhancer regions having a score higher than or equal to  <dig> , the threshold score used in original study  <cit> , for each tf at time point 0h.

the percentage of bound enhancers for a set of  <dig> principal tfs is shown, based on chip-seq data . tfs bound to more than 5% enhancers are shown.

clustering of enhancers by the binding of principal tfs
enhancers were clustered using the binding by pu. <dig>  c/ebpβ, ctcf, atf <dig>  irf <dig>  and junb at time point 0h. for each of these  <dig> tfs, the highest score over the central  <dig> bins of  <dig> bps was assigned to each enhancer. scores higher than  <dig>  were set to  <dig> . enhancers were clustered using k-means clustering using these scores. the optimal number of clusters was estimated to be  <dig> using the gap statistic method  <cit> .

for the analysis of changes over the time points after stimulation, the same  <dig> clusters based on the time point 0h clustering were used to cluster enhancer regions. this was done by assigning regions to the most proximal cluster, in terms of euclidian distance.

gene expression analysis
from the rna-seq data taken from macrophages at three time points , rpkm  values were calculated for all genes, and subjected to quantile normalization. we identified  <dig>  genes with at least 3-fold differential expression over the three time points, and at least one time point with rpkm higher than  <dig>  these genes were clustered into  <dig> classes  based on their log values using hierarchical clustering. in addition, we defined a class of genes with unchanged expression after stimulation as the  <dig>  genes with the smallest fold changes over the three time points.

micro-array gene expression data for atf <dig> knock-out  and wild-type  bmdms was obtained from arrayexpress   <cit> . rma normalized probe intensities were averaged over duplicate experiments, and gene expression levels were calculated by averaging over probes.

assigning genes to enhancer regions
enhancer regions were naively assigned to the most proximal gene, based on the distance in bases between the center of the enhancer region and the gene's tss. multiple enhancers can be assigned to the same gene.

for the analysis of associations between enhancer classes and sets of genes with a particular expression profile , we first counted for each set of genes, the number of assigned enhancer regions of each enhancer class. next, a z score was calculated based on this count and the average and standard deviation of expected counts obtained from  <dig> sets of enhancers with randomly shuffled enhancer class indices.

further supporting analysis and data availability
distances between pairs of enhancers were calculated as the distance in bases between their centers. gc content and cpg scores in regions were calculated in bins of  <dig> bps. tfbs motif enrichment was performed as described in additional file  <dig> .

the short-read sequence data obtained for this research are registered in the ddbj under accession nos.   and  .

RESULTS
identification of enhancer regions using epigenetic markers and transcription initiation events
given the known chromatin signature associated with active and inactive promoters and enhancer regions, we detected  <dig>  genomic regions based on statistically significant enrichment of epigenetic markers, h3k4me <dig>  h3k27me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig>  along with transcription initiation events . to identify enhancer regions among these candidate regions, we used k-means clustering which resulted in  <dig> distinct clusters . the cluster  with high levels of transcription initiation events also showed high levels of h3k4me <dig> and lower levels of h3k4me <dig> , fitting well with the known characteristics of active promoters. the "enhancer" cluster , on the other hand, lacked high levels of transcription initiation and h3k4me <dig>  but contained high levels of h3k4me <dig>  and thus is consistent with previous findings. there is a clear difference in the profile of the h3k4me <dig> marker; in the promoter group h3k4me <dig> is limited to regions surrounding the strong h3k4me <dig> peak, which is absent in the enhancer cluster . other properties of the "active promoter" and "enhancer" regions are also consistent with known characteristics . the two remaining clusters were marked by high levels of the repressive marker h3k27me <dig>  either in combination with low levels of h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  or by the repressive marker h3k27me <dig> alone . for the remainder of this paper we will focus on the analysis of the "enhancer" regions.

clustering of enhancer regions according to binding by  <dig> principal transcription factors
we verified the binding of tfs to enhancer regions in unstimulated cells using chip-seq data for a set of  <dig> tfs that are highly expressed in bmdcs  <cit>  . we found that in addition to pu. <dig> and c/ebpβ, a number of other tfs are also associated with a substantial fraction of enhancers . in particular, atf <dig>  irf <dig>  and junb were significantly bound to more than 5% of enhancers and promoters. interestingly, the insulator-binding protein ctcf was associated with  <dig> % of enhancers , consistent with observations made in recent studies  <cit> . in order to reveal the pattern of combinatorial tf binding to enhancers and analyze their distinctive properties, we further clustered enhancer regions in terms of binding by  <dig> principal tfs . again, using k- means clustering, with the optimal number of clusters based on the gap statistic method  <cit>  , enhancers were clustered into  <dig> classes . we roughly divided these  <dig> classes of enhancers into  <dig> groups according to the number of principal tfs binding them. the  <dig> classes were specified here using a 2-character index, with the first index reflecting the number of principal tf binding them; h , m , l , and c . the second index indicates a further subdivision and ranged from 1- <dig>  this clustering allows us to make several observations. first, there exists considerable variety in the sets of tfs binding enhancer regions. class h <dig> enhancers are bound by pu. <dig>  c/ebpβ, atf <dig>  irf <dig>  and junb, while class l <dig> enhancers are bound by none of the  <dig> principal tfs. compared to class h <dig> enhancers, class h <dig> and h <dig> enhancers lack irf <dig> and atf <dig> binding, respectively. other classes are bound by other combinations of tfs. second, most of the enhancer classes are bound by pu. <dig> and c/ebpβ as a pair or in combination with other principal tfs. these enhancers fit well with the notion that macrophage- and dc-specific enhancers are defined by pu. <dig> as a master regulator in combination with c/ebpβ as a lineage-specific tf. however, in addition to a large subset of enhancers being bound by none of the  <dig> principal tfs , a number of classes lack binding by pu. <dig> , or c/ebpβ , or both . the existence of classes l <dig> and c <dig> suggest that junb or ctcf are able to bind h3k4me1-marked regions even in the absence of master regulator pu. <dig> and c/ebpβ. classes l <dig> and l <dig> suggest that h3k4me1-marked regions can be bound by either pu. <dig> or c/ebpβ in the absence of any of the other principal tfs. tfbs sequence motif analysis confirmed many of the observed binding tendencies . together, these results suggest considerable variety in tf binding at enhancer regions, and that a substantial fraction of enhancers differ in their tf binding from "typical" myeloid apc enhancers.

h <dig> class enhancers are especially associated with induced genes and binding by tfs activated after lps stimulation
to evaluate potentially different biological functions of distinct enhancer classes, we investigated and compared a number of features of all classes. first, we evaluated correlations between the presence of enhancers of certain classes and gene expression patterns in nearby genes. we clustered genes with differential expression following lps stimulation into  <dig> sets; early induction, late induction, gradual induction, and repression , and we also defined a set of  <dig> genes with no change in expression as a negative control. for each set of genes we examined the class of nearby enhancers, and identified significant associations . we found that h <dig> enhancers were strongly associated with early induction genes  , or induced genes in general . this is consistent with the observation made by garber et al.  <cit> . the rest of highly bound enhancers , and also a set of lowly bound enhancer , which are defined mainly by junb binding, showed associations with induced genes. c <dig> enhancers, on the other hand, which are bound by ctcf, had no strong association with induced genes. we observed that l <dig> enhancers were associated with genes lacking expression change , and had a corresponding tendency not to be associated with early induction genes . second, we found differences in tf binding  induced by lps stimulation . here too we found that enhancers of class h <dig> were preferentially bound by nf-κb subunits . this was true even before stimulation but the difference became greater after stimulation: of the  <dig>  h <dig> enhancer regions,  <dig>  regions  were bound by rela  <dig> hours after stimulation . a similar tendency was seen for stat <dig>  stat <dig>  and stat <dig> binding. although there was virtually no binding prior to stimulation,  <dig> enhancers of class h <dig>  were bound by stat <dig>   <dig> hours after stimulation. other transcription factors also had a strong preference to bind to h <dig> enhancers, both before and after stimulation. these include ahr, irf <dig>  runx <dig>  egr <dig>  and maff . similar but weaker observations were made for enhancer classes h <dig> and h <dig>  but also c <dig> regions. on the other hand, enhancers of classes l <dig> and l <dig> tended to lack binding by any of the investigated tfs .

together, the above results indicate that enhancers can be separated into several classes based on their binding by a set of principal tfs in unstimulated cells, and that the classification defines to a large extent their binding by other tfs even after stimulation as well as changes in expression of nearby genes after stimulation. our results also suggest that enhancers that are highly bound, in particular class h <dig>  play a more important role in the regulation of transcription in response to immune stimulation.

dynamics of enhancer classes following lps stimulation
the above results imply that the binding by a few principal tfs to enhancers prior to stimulation controls the behaviour of nearby genes after lps stimulation. however, it is also possible that there is considerable dynamics in enhancer classes themselves after stimulation. in immune cells in particular, binding of the principal tfs to enhancers might be influenced by stimulation. to investigate the nature and extent of such changes in principal tf binding, we used the same classifiers derived prior to stimulation to classify enhancers based on their tf binding patterns at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mins after stimulation by lps.

our results suggest that enhancers experience extensive changes in the binding by the principal tfs following stimulation . some of the class transitions involving class h <dig> enhancers are shown in figure  <dig>  during the first  <dig> minutes following stimulation,  <dig>  regions  change from class h <dig> to h <dig> , resulting in a drop from  <dig>  to  <dig>  h <dig> regions. a further  <dig> out of  <dig>  remaining h <dig> regions  switch to h <dig> in the following  <dig> minutes . however, between  <dig> and  <dig> minutes following stimulation a change in the opposite direction occurs, with  <dig>  h <dig> regions and  <dig> h <dig> regions changing to class h <dig> regions, bringing the final count to  <dig>  regions. this includes  <dig>   of the original h <dig> regions.

these results illustrate that the classification of enhancers is not static, and that enhancers are able to gain and lose binding by one or more of the principal tfs following stimulation, which, in our analysis, is reflected by class transitions.

h <dig> enhancers that transiently lose atf <dig> binding following lps stimulation are associated with early transiently induced genes
as an illustration of the biological relevance of our enhancer classification and their changes over time, we focus here on one of the frequent changes: the transient loss of atf <dig> binding at h <dig> enhancers at time point  <dig> h, with a restoration of atf <dig> binding at 1h, resulting in a change of h <dig> -> h <dig> -> h <dig>  of the  <dig>  h <dig> enhancers,  <dig> follow this pattern. one example is an enhancer located about  <dig> kb upstream of the gene cxcl <dig>  which is illustrated in figure 6a. this gene encodes a member of the cxc subfamily of chemokines, and plays a role in the acute inflammatory response through the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection  <cit> . both rna-seq data  and microarray data  <cit>  show that cxcl <dig> transcription is strongly induced at an early stage after lps stimulation . atf <dig> has been shown to be a negative regulator in the tlr <dig> signalling pathway through the recruitment of histone deacetylases  <cit> . however, a potential regulatory role of the transient loss of atf <dig> binding at enhancer regions after tlr activation in the regulation of early  induced genes has not been described before.

the  <dig> enhancers transiently losing atf <dig> binding are enriched around lps-induced genes in general, but in particular in regions proximal to  <dig> early induced genes  and  <dig> transiently induced genes at time point 1h  . this enrichment is stronger than that of other subsets of h <dig> enhancers after lps stimulation . these results suggest that the transient loss of atf <dig> at these enhancers plays a role in the regulation of a subset of early and transiently induced genes. this hypothesis is supported by the enrichment of these enhancers around  <dig> genes that have a higher expression in a atf3-/- ko bmdms compared to wt bmdms .

the above observations also fit well with the interactions between atf <dig> and histone deacetylases, as suggested by gilchrist et al.  <cit> . acetylation of histones results in a more relaxed chromatin structure, increasing the accessibility of regions to tf binding, while deacetylation has the opposite effect. higher levels of atf <dig> binding might thus result in an increase of histone acetylation and in higher transcription initiation rates through the binding of additional tfs. in the case of cxcl <dig>  the loss of atf <dig> at the region around -38kb coincides with binding by rela  and the induction of cxcl <dig> transcription . one hour after stimulation, atf <dig> binding is restored, rela binding decreases, and gene expression reaches a plateau, followed by dropping levels of mrna. probe intensities of cxcl <dig>  after lps stimulation are on average 2- to 4-fold higher in the atf <dig> ko compared to wt cells . similar higher expression in the atf <dig> ko was observed for other early-induced genes having a nearby enhancer following the h <dig> -> h <dig> -> h <dig> pattern .

tf binding changes associated with enhancer class dynamics following stimulation
little is known about the forces that influence tf binding at enhancers over time after stimulation of cells. here, we examined two factors: the binding of other tfs that are only activated after stimulation, and inter-enhancer interactions.

we investigated the binding of tfs to regions where enhancer class transitions occur, and found several examples of activated tfs whose binding is correlated with enhancer class transitions. for example, enhancers of class h <dig> which change to h <dig>  tend to have lower levels of binding by rela and irf <dig> compared to regions that retain an h <dig> profile . they have lower runx <dig> binding both before and after stimulation, and  <dig> mins. after stimulation they tend to be not bound by stat family tfs .

on the other hand, enhancers of class h <dig> which change to class h <dig>  between  <dig> and  <dig> mins. or between  <dig> and  <dig> mins. following stimulation show a tendency to gain binding by rela at the time when the enhancer class transition occurs . enhancers changing from class h <dig> to h <dig> between  <dig> and  <dig> mins. on the other hand, have a tendency to be already enriched for binding by rela compared to regions where no binding by atf <dig> occurs. these regions, too, have an additional increase in rela binding following the transition to class h <dig>  similarly, h <dig> regions changing to class h <dig> have a higher tendency to be bound by irf <dig> compared to h <dig> regions lacking a transition to h <dig> . these findings suggest a certain interaction between binding of rela and/or irf <dig> and binding of atf <dig>  and the formation of a h <dig> type environment.

similar results were obtained for class h <dig> regions changing to class h <dig> . in addition, enhancers of classes h <dig> and h <dig> that switch to h <dig> tend to have relatively higher binding by maff even before stimulation and before making the class transition , and later on these regions show relatively high binding by rel, relb, runx <dig>  e2f <dig>  and egr <dig>  and after  <dig> hours additional binding by stat family members. similar changes were also observed for other time points, and on a smaller scale for regions of other classes changing to class h <dig> 

these observations further underline the importance of the binding pattern of enhancers of class h <dig>  consisting of binding by pu. <dig>  c/ebpβ, junb, atf <dig>  and irf <dig>  which form together an environment that can easily be bound by several other tfs, including tfs that are activated following stimulation, such as nf-κb and stat family members. the coincidence of binding changes at certain points following stimulation also suggests a certain degree of mutual influence or cooperativity between tfs.

nearby enhancers influence enhancer class dynamics following stimulation
the existence of interactions between distal elements through looping is widely recognized. several studies have described interactions, through looping, between promoters and distal sites, including enhancers  <cit> . however, interactions between pairs of enhancers, and their potential functions, are often ignored. in a final step, we evaluated whether proximally located enhancers might influence the binding of tfs after stimulation, and in particular how this might affect the formation of enhancers of class h <dig> 

for each enhancer we calculated the distance to the most proximally located enhancer of each class, for each time point before and after stimulation. we picked up enhancers with a transition to a different class between time points, and compared the distances to each class of enhancers. we did the same for enhancers that did not have a transition to a different class. finally, we compared the two sets of distances using a t-test.

in general, we found that enhancers changing to a certain class "x", tend to be located relatively proximally to an existing enhancer of class "x" . for example, enhancers of class h <dig> that change to class h <dig> between time points  <dig> and  <dig> mins. tend to be more closely located to already existing enhancers of class h <dig> . similarly, between  <dig> and  <dig> mins. after stimulation, h <dig> enhancers switching to h <dig> are located more proximally to existing h <dig> enhancers . finally, between  <dig> and  <dig> mins. after stimulation, a large fraction of h <dig> enhancers change to h <dig> enhancers. these h <dig> enhancers tend to be located proximally to existing h <dig> enhancers .

based on the assumption that proximally located enhancer pairs are more likely to be interacting than distally located ones, these results suggest that the presence of enhancers belonging to one particular class make nearby enhancers more likely to change to that same class. in other words, the tfs binding to an enhancer can be influenced by tfs bound to surrounding enhancers. in the case of h <dig> enhancers, the existence of h <dig> enhancers can induce nearby enhancers to gain binding by principal tfs and to thus become h <dig> enhancers, a process that is aided by the activation and binding of specific tfs following stimulation .

CONCLUSIONS
in this integrative analysis we used newly obtained rna-seq and tss data in combination with publicly available data sets to address several questions concerning the features and dynamics of enhancers, in particular, variations in the sets of tfs binding their functional role in the regulation of transcription following stimulation, and the dynamics in binding by tfs following stimulation. for this we employed a set of datasets from myeloid apcs, allowing us to identify enhancer regions. we initially classified enhancer regions according to the tfs binding to them before stimulation, and we found a number of different enhancer classes, each defined by a different set of binding regulators. although many regions appeared to be bound by pu. <dig> and c/ebpβ, several classes lacked one or even both of these regulators. importantly, there was a strong association between genes that are induced upon lps stimulation and a class of enhancers that are bound by pu. <dig>  c/ebpβ, atf <dig>  irf <dig>  and junb .

interestingly, key regulators of the transcriptional response to lps stimulation, such as nf-κb, irfs, and stat family tfs, bind preferentially to these h <dig> enhancer regions after stimulation. moreover, following stimulation, there was considerable dynamics in the binding of enhancers by the principal tfs, and we observed that the acquisition of a class h <dig> enhancer binding profile tends to co-occur with the binding of nf-κb subunits, especially rela. this suggests that the tfs bound by class h <dig> enhancers create a local environment that facilitates the binding of activated tfs, and that activated tfs contribute in the creation of this environment. regulators that are activated at later time points, such as the stat family tfs, also tend to favour binding to the class h <dig> enhancers.

in addition to the influence of activated tfs, our results suggest that regions with similar sets of bound tfs  tend to gain irf <dig> or atf <dig> binding especially when they are located relatively proximally to existing class h <dig> enhancers. this too supports the existence of a local environment with increased tf binding, which might easily influence nearby enhancers, for example through looping of the dna.

together, our results suggest that genes can be marked for rapid induction even before stimulation by specific combinations of tfs binding to nearby enhancers, allowing for rapid initiation of transcription following stimulation. however, several levels of regulation appear to be present after stimulation, including interactions between proximally located pairs of enhancers. such interactions might influence the induction time or stability of transcription of nearby genes, which are important factors in the response against pathogens. future analyses using carbon-copy chromosome conformation capture  or related techniques will be necessary to further investigate the interactions between enhancers with particular tf binding profiles and their changes over time.

our results confirmed that a large fraction of regions with enhancer-like features in myeloid apcs are bound by pu. <dig> and c/ebpβ, as has recently been reported  <cit> . however, we showed that the specific properties of the enhancers are defined by the specific subset of tfs binding to them, even before stimulation. our integrative study underscores the importance of detailed analysis of high-throughput sequencing data and how it can reveal findings that are obscured when averaging over all enhancers.
