BACKGROUND
mirna genes are typically transcribed by rna polymerase ii into primary mirna  transcripts, and transcription appears to be regulated in a similar process as traditional coding genes  <cit> . pri-mirna transcripts are long non-coding rnas  with stem-loop secondary structures that contain precursor mirnas . pri-mirna transcripts are cleaved co-transcriptionally by the enzyme drosha into stem loop pre-mirnas, which are exported to the cytoplasm by exportin  <dig>  and further processed by dicer into mature mirna that can be loaded in the rna induced silencing complex . pre-mirna levels are low relative to pri- and mature mirnas, suggesting that dicing is an efficient mechanism with little regulation  <cit> . during development, many pri-mirnas are expressed but not efficiently processed to mature mirna  <cit> . in healthy tissues, the ratio of pri- to mature mirnas has been shown to be close to one, while in cancer cells, a large number of mirna genes are transcribed but not processed to mature mirna  <cit> . an expanding body of evidence supports a role for mirnas in disease progression and the potential for epigenetic mechanisms to regulate mirna expression  <cit> . epigenetics is the heritable modification of gene expression without changes in the dna sequence. the importance of regulated epigenetic information is highlighted by the disruption of multiple epigenetic marks in various disease states, including cancer, which is commonly associated with deregulation of dna methylation, histone modifications and mirna expression  <cit> . cytosine methylation of cpg islands associated with gene promoters is a well-studied epigenetic mark, and aberrant dna hypermethylation in combination with altered histone architecture is a common hallmark of neoplastic cells  <cit> . histone acetylation at lysine  <dig>  is associated with an active chromatin state and changes in its global patterning are linked to poor prognosis in multiple cancers  <cit> . mirnas have been shown to function as tumor suppressors and oncogenes, through the targeting of essential elements of cellular growth, proliferation and apoptotic pathways  <cit> . genomic loci encoding mirnas can become epigenetically remodelled in cancer, however the extent and effect of these changes in cancer remains to be elucidated  <cit> .

we argue that a minority of mirna genes, critical to regulation of cellular growth, proliferation, or survival, gain epigenetic modifications to enable persistent enhancement or inhibition of their activity in order to maintain a neoplastic phenotype. using an integrative approach combining primary transcription, genome-wide dna methylation and h3k9ac patterns with mature mirna levels, we identified a number of mirna genes that showed epigenetic remodeling in cancer in combination with de-regulation of both the primary and mature mirna. this demonstrates that integration of multiple methods of analysis may provide a reliable method for the identification of epigenetically regulated mirnas.

RESULTS
we proposed that epigenetically de-regulated mirnas in cancer would show three characteristics: first, differential expression at the primary transcript level, second, differential mature mirna expression, and finally an associated change in one or more epigenetic marks. to eliminate post-transcriptionally regulated mirnas that showed accumulation of epigenetic marks independent of their transcription, an integrative pipeline that assessed all three criteria was developed .

normal prostate epithelial  and prostate cancer  cells were used as a model system to test this integrative pipeline in the discovery of epigenetically de-regulated mirnas in cancer. custom high-density nimblegen tiling arrays covering mirna loci from mirbase v <dig>  were designed and used to probe total rna to determine transcription levels, and dna from methylated-dna immunoprecipitation  and h3k9ac immunoprecipitation to investigate epigenetic changes. the oligonucleotide probes of these arrays have an average length of 60nt, precluding interference of the mature 20-23nt mirnas, thus assaying the full-length primary transcripts. plotting the array probe intensities against chromosomal coordinates generated high-resolution maps of expression and epigenetic mark enrichment across each locus . to generate lists of loci significantly changed in lncap cells for each assay, we selected those that were consistently changed in the cancer cell line within  <dig> bp of the center of the mirna gene. for our comparisons, we limited the number of mirnas to those that were assayed by both taqman® low density arrays   and tiling array:  <dig> mirnas in total. all changes are articulated as lncap with respect to prec.

looking at those loci whose primary transcript repression or activation in lncap was associated with a significant change in the mature mirna, we identified  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated mirnas . we then looked for concomitant epigenetic changes at these loci in the tiling array data. a high proportion of the upregulated  and downregulated loci  showed an overlap with at least one of these epigenetic marks . the majority  of these mirnas have previously been identified as deregulated in various cancers, and five with prior evidence for epigenetic regulation . a concordant change in all assays; expression, dna methylation, and h3k9ac restricted the total number of candidate mirnas to 2/ <dig> up- and 4/ <dig> downregulated . given the large number of possible epigenetic modifications , it is possible that many of the differentially expressed loci that show no change in dna methylation or h3k9ac could undergo changes in other epigenetic marks. furthermore, mirnas may be regulated by dna methylation at cpg islands outside the  <dig> bp regions interrogated in this analysis.

in order to perform an independent test for mirnas regulated by dna methylation, we treated lncap and prec cells with the drug 5-aza-cdr, an inhibitor of dna methylation, and analysed their expression by tlda. restricting our list to mirnas that were significantly deregulated between prec and lncap we found  <dig> upregulated by 5-aza-cdr in prec and  <dig> in lncap. of the mirna loci showing epigenetic activation by the three criteria of primary transcript expression, dna methylation loss and h3k9ac gain, only mir- <dig> showed 5-aza-cdr induced reactivation in the normal prostate prec cells . mir- <dig>  mir-196b and mir- <dig> satisfied all three criteria for epigenetic repression, and lncap 5-aza-cdr reactivation .

mirna genes showing non-canonical epigenetic regulation were also observed. that is, mirnas showing up regulation of primary and mature mirna expression, with a concomitant gain of dna methylation or loss of h3k9ac, or vice versa. twelve mirnas showed activation and gain of repressive epigenetic marks and six  showed repression in combination with active chromatin . none of these mirnas showed significant up regulation upon treatment with 5-aza-cdr. several mirnas were repressed in the presence of the demethylating drug, suggesting the repression of these loci may be dependent on genes that are themselves subject to regulation by dna methylation.

to validate the changes in primary mirna expression, we performed pri-mirna taqman® qpcr on the four mirnas that met all our criteria. these assays confirmed the repression of pri-mir- <dig> and pri-mir- <dig>  and over expression of pri-mir- <dig> in lncap cells . there was no significant change in pri-mir-196b between lncap and prec, however treatment with 5-aza-cdr led to overexpression in prec cells . 5-aza-cdr led to overexpression of pri-mir- <dig> and pri-mir- <dig> in lncap, as would be predicted by their dna methylation status . however, reactivation of pri-mir- <dig> by 5-aza-cdr was not significant .

to verify changes in dna methylation we analysed recently published methyl-cpg binding domain-based capture  data from lncap and prec cells  <cit> . mbdcap preferentially captures dna methylated double-stranded dna which is then eluted for high-throughput sequencing  <cit> . we examined the number of sequencing reads that mapped to within  <dig> bp of the selected mirna loci. in agreement with the tiling array data, there was enrichment of sequencing reads at the mir196b locus . mir <dig> and mir <dig> had increased reads in lncap over prec, however there was also an increase in the input dna controls. mir <dig> showed a low number of sequencing events in both lncap and prec and input controls .

the identification of mir- <dig> as an epigenetically repressed mirna is consistent with a previous study that examined chromatin modifications in prostate cells using genome-wide promoter arrays, which revealed a gain of the repressive h3k27-trimethylation mark and loss of the active h3k4-trimethylation mark at the mir <dig> locus in prostate cancer cells  <cit> . furthermore, we recently reported that mir <dig> locus is silenced and gains promoter hypermethylation and repressive chromatin marks in invasive bladder tumors and undifferentiated bladder cell lines  <cit> . two expression array studies have also identified mir- <dig> as repressed in prostate cancer  <cit> . while the repression of pri-mir- <dig> was validated by qpcr, the lack of significant change in dna methylation observed in the mbdcap high-throughput sequencing data could be due to differences between the techniques. both mir <dig> and mir <dig> reside in regions of low cpg density, whereas mir196b and mir <dig> are located in regions of high cpg density, which may bias the purification efficiencies. variations between pri-mirna and array results, such as with pri-mir196b, could be accounted for by differences in assay design. an advantage of the tiling array approach is the high-density coverage of all loci. pcr typically provides improved dynamic range over array analysis, however, the efficiency of a reaction can be limited by location of the primers - as may be the case with pri-mirna transcripts that have yet to be exhaustively mapped. mir- <dig> shows significant epigenetic repression in our array and qpcr analyses, contradictory to its well-established role as an oncogenic mirna that is overexpressed in cancer  <cit> , however recent evidence has also shown that mir- <dig> knockdown elicited no change in proliferative or invasive properties in prostate cancer cells  <cit> .

the potential for epigenetic regulation of mir <dig> has previously been shown in ovarian cancer, where treatment with 5-aza-cdr leads to mir- <dig> overexpression  <cit> , consistent with hypermethylation of the locus. it is possible that epigenetic mechanisms may play a role in context dependent regulation of mir- <dig> expression, and it would be interesting to examine the prevalence of epigenetic marks at in a cohort of clinical prostate cancer samples. the epigenetic regulation of both mir <dig> and mir196b is particularly intriguing as both genes are encoded from cpg islands located within hox gene clusters. mir196b has recently been shown to be hypomethylated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia  <cit>  and gastric cancer  <cit>  but to the best of our knowledge, the epigenetic regulation of mir <dig> is a novel discovery. mir <dig> is located within the hoxc cluster on chromosome  <dig>  which we previously have shown to be epigenetically deregulated in lncap cells in long range epigenetically silenced domains  <cit> . there is evidence that hox associated mirnas are essential for development and can function by targeting hox messenger rnas  <cit> . furthermore, hox genes have been reported to be involved in abnormal development and malignancy in numerous cancers via both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms  <cit> .

there are inherent limitations to the various available global epigenetic discovery techniques  <cit> . immunoprecipitation based techniques can be affected by antibody sensitivity and medip can be biased towards regions of high cpg content, leading to increased false-negatives at gc-poor sites  <cit> . in addition, treatment with demethylating drugs such as 5-aza-cdr can uncover false positives through activation or repression of downstream targets  <cit> . a multi-platform approach can help rule out many of these false positive results, but the problem of false negatives remains. here we show that using mirna primary transcript data enables leverage of the known mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of mirnas as an additional means of epigenetic marker discovery. epigenetic marks such as dna methylation possess several advantages as biomarkers; dna is more robust than rna, can be isolated from formalin fixed paraffin-embedded archival samples and dna methylation provides a positive readout for genes or mirnas that are downregulated  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we found that up to 33% of transcriptionally deregulated mirna loci displayed concordant dna methylation and h3k <dig> acetylation patterns. extending the analysis to additional epigenetic marks, such as the methylation of h3k <dig>  h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> and acetylation at h3k <dig> will increase the number of identified loci. the use of tiling arrays in this study enabled analysis within  <dig> bp of a mirna gene and the increasing availability of high-throughput sequencing technology will allow this approach to be extended genome wide. the prevalence of mirnas that show contradicting expression and epigenetic marks suggests that there is a subset of genes that are subject to a complex pattern of regulation, where specific marks may recruit activators or repressors to a promoter. we propose that in cancer, a change in primary transcript expression at mirna loci provides an important first step in the identification of those mirnas that display variant epigenetic marks. overlapping these loci with change in mature mirna restricts analysis to mirnas that are functionally relevant and that provide possible selective advantage to the cancer cell. further discovery of dna hyper- and hypo-methylated mirnas in cancer using this type of integrative discovery pipeline should assist in identifying loci that may provide reliable novel diagnostic tools.
