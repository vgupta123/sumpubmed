BACKGROUND
amelogenesis is the developmental process of dental enamel formation. amelogenesis involves two major functional stages, secretory and maturation, and these stages are clearly demarcated by a transition zone in the continuously growing rodent incisor teeth  <cit> . the transition of ameloblasts from secretory to maturation stage, characterized by both morphological and functional changes, results in the formation of mature enamel with ordered crystallite structures. gene dysregulation at any stage of amelogenesis can result in a group of hereditary conditions called amelogenesis imperfecta  that adversely affect the structure and appearance of enamel . although researchers today have a very clear idea of the molecular activities that define secretory-stage amelogenesis  <cit> , the molecular events that define enamel maturation remain understudied.

micrornas  are a class of small non-coding rnas that regulate the expression of target genes by directly binding to their target mrnas. to date, there are two functional studies that used the deletion of dicer- <dig> to analyze mirna function during tooth development  <cit> . the epithelial deletion of dicer- <dig>  using the keratin  <dig> gene promoter-cre recombinase combination , does not induce embryonic tooth defects  <cit> , whereas the earlier epithelial deletion of dicer- <dig>  triggered by pitx2-cre, or mesenchymal deletion under the control of wnt1-cre, led to a severe dental phenotype  <cit> . in vitro studies showed that mir-34a regulates human dental papilla cell differentiation by targeting notch and tgf-beta signaling  <cit> . mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> control odontoblast differentiation and dentin formation through klf <dig> and osx transcriptional factor signaling pathways  <cit> .

dynamic changes in mirna levels have been observed during tooth development. based on microarray profiling studies,  <dig> mirnas have been identified to be both stage- and tissue-specific in murine tooth formation  <cit> . that is, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-875-5p and mir- <dig> were expressed mainly during tooth morphogenesis identified at embryonic day  <dig> , whereas mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were prevalent at the cytodifferentiation stage   <cit> . a more recent study that combined both deep sequencing and microarray approaches to elucidate the mirna expression profiles in the bud, cap, early bell and late bell stages of developing lower deciduous molars of miniature pigs identified  <dig> mirnas expressed differentially across the four stages  <cit> . a subsequent bioinformatic prediction suggested that  <dig> of these mirnas play key roles during tooth development, including let-7f, mir- <dig>  mir-200b and mir-200c  <cit> . two epithelial stem cell niches, located in the labial and lingual cervical loop regions, have been identified and shown to have different mirna expression profiles  <cit> . together these observations indicate that mirnas are dynamically involved in tooth development by fine-tuning tooth morphogenesis and patterning, as well as terminal cell differentiation and tissue homeostasis.

to investigate the potential role of mirna regulation in maturation-stage tooth development, we conducted genome-wide mirna and mrna transcript expression profiling analyses of secretory-stage and maturation-stage enamel organs obtained from rat incisors. we identified a group of stage-specific mirnas and identified candidate gene targets based on bioinformatic prediction. two maturation-stage-related genes, lamp <dig> and tfrc, were verified by luciferase reporter assay to be the target genes of mirna regulators. the results indicated a dynamic expression pattern of mirnas during the transition from secretory-stage to maturation-stage enamel mineralization, and suggest that mirnas can influence key processes of enamel maturation.

methods
animal dissection and total rna isolation
all vertebrate animal studies complied with institutional and federal guidelines  protocol number 11736). we used rat incisors as the source of total rna, because the reference line that separates the secretory- and maturation-stage enamel organs along the enamel surface has been well established in rats  <cit> . four male wistar hannover rats, 4-week-old, weighing 100-110 g, were sacrificed for their mandibles. after being frozen and kept in liquid nitrogen overnight, the mandibles were subsequently lyophilized over the following 24 h. the bone encasing the enamel surface of incisors was then carefully removed and the exposed multicellular layer, which contains mostly the secretory- and maturation-stage enamel organs, was collected into separate rnase-free eppendorf tubes. dissection procedures followed previously described protocols  <cit> . the total rna including mirna was extracted from secretory- and maturation-stage enamel organs using mirneasy mini kit . the enamel organs isolated from the four rats were fully processed and analyzed separately .

sample quality control by quantitative real-time pcr analysis
using previously described methods, the expression of two stage-specific genes, odam  and enam , were checked by real-time pcr to ensure the accuracy of dissections and quality of total rna collected from each individual sample  <cit> . cdna used for real-time pcr analysis of odam and enam was synthesized using miscript ii rt kit with miscript hiflex buffer . real-time pcr reactions were performed with iq sybr® green supermix  and rat-specific primers . for all rna sample pairs  quantitative real-time pcr for odam showed an increase in expression in maturation-stage by > <dig> fold, while enam expression was clearly evident in the secretory stage, but negligible in the maturation stage. these results indicated that the samples were suitable to use for additional genome profiling experiments.

genome-wide mirna and mrna profiling analysis
genome-wide mirna profiling analysis was conducted based on the rat mirnome miscript mirna pcr array , which profiles the expression of the  <dig> most abundantly expressed and best characterized mirna sequences in the rat mirna genome as annotated by the mirbase release  <dig>  cdna was prepared using miscript ii rt kit with miscript hispec buffer . miscript sybr green pcr kit  was used for the real-time pcr reactions on the miscript mirna pcr array and the real-time instrument was a lightcycler  <dig> .

on the exact same rna samples used for mirna expression profiling analysis, we conducted genome-wide mrna transcriptome analysis using ratref-12-v <dig> expression beadchips . this platform interrogates approximately  <dig>  transcripts selected primarily from the national center for biotechnology information  refseq database . all sample preparation, hybridization, beadchips processing, and data acquisition were performed at the southern california genotyping consortium , according to the manufacturers’ recommended protocols.

mirna and mrna expression profiling analyses were conducted on four animals, with each animal providing both secretory- and maturation-stage rna samples. each individual rna sample was analyzed both for mirna expression  and for mrna expression. in total,  <dig> mirna  and  <dig> mrna global expression data sets were generated in this study. original gene expression data files are available for download from the gene expression omnibus  under geo accession record gse <dig> 

mirna and mrna gene expression data processing
raw mirna expression data generated on mirnome miscript mirna pcr arrays were processed using sas  <dig>  statistical software. all raw data were acquired in the form of ct values. the raw ct values were normalized to the average ct values of the six internal controls located in the last row of each 384-well plate. for the purpose of downstream analyses, we assigned a single expression score to each mirna based on the average of data obtained from three replicates. all processed data from all 24-mirna expression profiling experiments are provided in additional file  <dig> 

raw mrna gene expression data generated using ratref-12-v <dig> expression beadchips were processed using the r statistical package to produce normalized logarithm-transformed gene expression scores  <cit> . processed data from all  <dig> mrna expression profiling experiments are provided in additional file  <dig>  differences in the expression levels of each mrna and mirna between secretory- and maturation-stage tooth development were evaluated using two-tail student t test, and the type i error was controlled using the benjamini hochberg  method. in additional file  <dig>  we provide a summary of the numbers of differentially expressed mrnas and mirnas based on a variety of commonly used fc and fdr criteria. hierarchical clustering analyses of mrna and mirna data sets were based on euclidean distance and average linkage metrics and conducted using partek® genomics suite version  <dig>   .figure  <dig>

pathway analysis
we used ingenuity pathway analysis   to predict gene targets for differentially expressed mirnas identified by qpcr array analysis. in order to refine further the number of predicted targets for differentially expressed mirnas, we used ipa to compare the list of predicted gene targets and the list of maturation stage-specific genes identified by mrna transcriptome profiling on beadchips. genes in common between these two lists were uploaded to webgestalt for gene ontology  and kegg  pathway analysis  <cit>  . the selection criteria for enriched go categories were b-h adjusted p <  <dig>  for fisher’s exact test and minimum  <dig> genes in enriched categories. ipa also was used to analyze the functional relationships between differentially expressed mirnas and these overlapping genes .figure  <dig> 
flow chart depicting the strategy used to select mirna target genes for pathway analyses.




to begin to estimate baseline expectations of how mirna level could influence mrna levels in our system, we generated a list of stably expressed mirnas present in both the secretory and maturation stages ). as above, we used ipa to predict mrna targets for these stably expressed mirnas and compared this list of predicted targets with the differentially expressed mrnas identified through mrna transcriptome profiling on beadchips.

in situ hybridization analysis of selected mirnas expression
the mandibles were dissected out from euthanized wistar hannover rats , with the surrounding soft tissues removed. the hemimandibles were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde  at 4°c overnight, decalcified in 10% edta  at 4°c for 10 weeks, and embedded in paraffin for sectioning. sagittal sections of 7 μm were prepared and lna-dig mirna detection probes, including u <dig> probes  and scrambled probes , were utilized for mirna in situ hybridization. all the procedures for the in situ hybridization analyses were performed following the one-day protocol recommended by the manufacturers, with the probe concentration and substrate incubation time adjusted for each of tested probes individually. information regarding probe sequences and the complete in situ hybridization protocol can be found on the website of exiqon .

cell culture and luciferase reporter assay
mouse ameloblast-like ls <dig> cells  <cit>  were used as the host cells for exogenous mirna mimics, mirna inhibitors and luciferase reporter vectors in the luciferase reporter assay. ls <dig> cells were cultured in low-glucose dmem medium  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum  at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> atmosphere. ls <dig> cells were seeded in 12-well cell culture plates to achieve a confluence of approximately 30% the day before transfection. lipofectamine® ltx with plus™ reagent  was diluted in fbs-free low-glucose dmem medium at a concentration recommended by the manufacturers.

luciferase reporter vectors containing 3′-utr of target genes and/or mirna mimics/inhibitors were mixed into diluted transfection reagents to form a transfection complex. immediately before transfection, the cell culture medium was changed to fbs-free low-glucose dmem medium. fbs-free low-glucose dmem medium was removed 3 h after transfection, and cells were then incubated in low-glucose dmem medium with 10% fbs. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed using the passive lysis buffer provided in the dual-luciferase® reporter assay system . luciferase assay reagent  and stop & go reagent were then added to the cell lysates sequentially. the luciferase reporter activities were detected using a turner biosystems luminometer td-20/ <dig> according to the manufacturers’ recommended protocol. each luciferase reporter assay was conducted with triplicate technical replicates.

two kinds of dual luciferase reporter vectors containing the 3′-utr of different mouse-specific target genes  were purchased from genecopoeia . mirna mimics and inhibitors for mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were also mouse-specific and were obtained from qiagen . for verifying the relations between mir- <dig>  and lamp <dig> expression, the setup of experimental groups involved ls <dig> cells: 1) transfected with luciferase reporter vector ; 2) co-transfected with mir- <dig> mimics and luciferase reporter vector ; 3) co-transfected with mir- <dig> inhibitors and luciferase reporter vector . for mir- <dig>  and tfrc, the experimental groups involved ls <dig> cells: 1) transfected with luciferase reporter vector ; 2) co-transfected by mir- <dig> mimics and luciferase reporter vector ; 3) co-transfected by mir- <dig> inhibitors and luciferase reporter vector .

the amount of luciferase reporter vector was stabilized at 700 ng per transfection, to achieve optimal dna transfection efficiency. the tested concentrations of mirna mimics in final transfection complex  were 20pm, 60pm and 120pm, while the tested concentrations of mirna inhibitors were  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm .

renilla luciferase activities were normalized to the firefly luciferase activities. for each verification experiment , two-tail student t-test was used to detect the statistical differences in normalized luciferase activities between experimental groups  <dig> and  <dig>  and between groups  <dig> and  <dig>  in real-time pcr analyses of mirna levels in ls <dig> cells following transfection, the raw ct values were normalized to those of rnu6- <dig>  the level of mirna at each time point after transfection was calculated relative to the level of rnu6- <dig> using the Δct method. the significance level for all statistical analyses mentioned above was p <  <dig> .

real-time pcr analysis of cellular mirna levels
prior to luciferase reporter assays, the levels of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in ls <dig> cells were detected using mirna real-time pcr analysis at different time points: 0 h, 6 h, 24 h and 48 h following transfection by mirna mimics or inhibitors. the levels of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were calculated relative to the level of rna u <dig> small nuclear  <dig> , as recommended by the manufacturers. the protocols for rna extraction, cdna synthesis and real-time pcr reactions were similar to the protocols of qpcr array analyses stated above. the mouse-specific primers of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and rnu6- <dig> were purchased from qiagen , and the primer sequences were not disclosed by the manufacturers.

RESULTS
mirnas are differentially expressed in enamel organs as they transition from secretory stage to maturation stage in tooth development
the mirna expression profiles of maturation-stage enamel development were compared to those of secretory-stage enamel development using total rna samples obtained from the enamel organs of rat incisors. although we considered multiple statistical cut-offs , herein we assigned differential expression based on ≥ <dig> -fc and <5% fdr between the two developmental stages. this provided a robust set of differentially expressed mirnas for follow-up analysis.

hierarchical clustering analysis of the most variably expressed mirnas across all samples showed that the maturation and secretory stages of enamel development have distinct mirna expression profiles . all the maturation-stage samples and all the secretory-stage samples were placed into non-overlapping groups. a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> mirnas were identified as being differentially expressed within maturation-stage enamel organs when compared to secretory-stage enamel organs. among these  <dig> stage-specific mirnas,  <dig> were up-regulated during maturation stage   while  <dig> were down-regulated . all raw ct values and relevant statistics can be found in the supplemental information .figure  <dig>

differentially expressed genes are identified at mrna level
the eight total rna samples used for parallel genome-wide transcript profiling  were from the same samples as those used for mirna expression profiling such that the two data sets  could be matched with each other. to be consistent with our mirna data analysis and also identify robust signals, we used the same criteria for differential gene expression as above  between the two developmental stages. a total of  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed  in the maturation-stage enamel organs compared to the secretory-stage enamel organs .

identifying differentially expressed genes that are predicted targets of the differentially expressed mirnas
the strategy we used to identify targets of differentially expressed mirnas is provided . the list of differentially expressed mirnas was uploaded to ipa to generate predicted gene targets using integrated prediction algorithms . a total of  <dig>  unique candidate target genes were predicted to be regulated by the  <dig> up-regulated  mirnas. likewise,  <dig>  unique candidate target genes were predicted to be regulated by the  <dig> down-regulated  mirnas. in parallel, we used the same computational methods to predict  <dig> unique gene targets for the  <dig> stably expressed mirnas in these maturation and secretory stage samples .

next, we sought to refine the candidate relationships between predicted gene targets of differentially expressed mirnas with our microarray-based measurements of mrna levels. approximately  <dig> %  of the candidate target genes were differentially expressed in the expected direction in our analysis . next, we compared the list of predicted gene targets of up-regulated mirnas with the observed list of down-regulated mrnas during enamel maturation . a total of  <dig> observed down-regulated genes were identified as the potential targets for the  <dig> up-regulated mirnas . a total of  <dig> out of these  <dig> genes were predicted to be regulated by multiple mirnas . conversely, we compared the predicted gene targets of down-regulated mirnas with the observed list of up-regulated mrnas during amelogenesis. a total of  <dig> up-regulated genes were identified as potential targets for the  <dig> down-regulated mirnas . among these  <dig> genes,  <dig> were predicted to have multiple mirna regulators .

to place our observations in perspective, we compared the list of predicted gene targets of stably expressed mirnas with the list of differentially expressed mrnas . approximately  <dig> % of the candidate target mrnas  were identified to be the potential targets for the stably expressed mirnas . thus, it is not remarkable that  <dig> % of the candidate target genes of differentially expressed mirnas are differentially expressed in the expected direction. there are numerous potential reasons for this including  transcription factors will play a dominant role in influencing mrna levels in accordance with our prior studies  <cit>  and  the magnitude of the mirna expression changes observed in our study where at least half of the protein-coding genes in the rodent genome were implicated as potential targets of differentially expressed mirnas.

thus, outside of translational regulation outside the scope of the current study, we propose that mirnas more likely serves to fine-tune the levels of transcripts that are rapidly up-regulated or down-regulated during amelogenesis. for example, if the immediate up-regulation of a gene transcription is needed, then excessive mrna may result, requiring immediate mirna-targeting to reach optimal levels. in such cases, increased levels of specific targeting mirna may be required to achieve this fine-tuning of highly up-regulated transcripts. to begin to address this issue, we identified  <dig> highly up-regulated mrnas  during amelogenesis that could be paired with predicted targeting mirnas that were also differentially expressed  during amelogenesis . a subset of these transcripts was subject to follow-up experiments described below.

candidate mirna regulated genes are enriched in key processes involved in enamel maturation
next, we used various pathway analyses to explore relationships among the differentially expressed mrnas that were candidate targets of differentially expressed mirnas. go analysis of the  <dig> up-regulated genes identified as potential targets for the  <dig> down-regulated mirnas highlighted  <dig> enriched categories . the categories most highly relevant to maturation-stage tooth development included: carboxylic acid transmembrane transporter activity  ; atpase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of ions, phosphorylative mechanism  ; endosome membrane  ; lysosome  ; calcium ion binding  ; and cytokine activity  . go analysis of the  <dig> down-regulated genes identified as potential targets for the  <dig> up-regulated mirnas highlighted  <dig> enriched categories . the categories that are seemingly most relevant to maturation-stage tooth development included: calcium ion transmembrane transporter activity  ; and extracellular matrix part , cation channel complex , golgi membrane , gtpase activity , regulation of cell-cell adhesion  and cell junction  .table  <dig>

we also conducted kegg analysis and ipa core analysis for each group of differentially expressed genes with and without involvement of mirnas . in general, we did not find noteworthy categories relevant to maturation-stage tooth development. nevertheless, we did find kegg pathways, including calcium signaling, ecm-receptor interaction, lysosome and endocytosis, that could be relevant to enamel maturation , and several ipa canonical pathways that are highly conserved during amelogenesis . the ipa-derived interaction networks of differentially expressed mirnas and their predicted gene targets showed clearly that mirnas are regulatory hubs in these enriched functional pathways . in addition, several genes were targets of multiple mirnas and served to connect these hubs. the details regarding the mirna-mrna interaction networks are provided in the .figure  <dig>

the expression of stage-specific mirnas confirmed by in situ hybridization
lna-dig mirna probes were used to detect mirna expression in enamel organs along the enamel surface of rat incisors . mandible section slides stained with u <dig> lna-dig served as the positive controls  and scrambled controls showed little background . the expression patterns of seven selected mirnas  were examined . in situ hybridization analyses of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> generated higher signal intensities in maturation-stage enamel organ cells than in secretory-stage enamel organ cells , and this data correlates well  with the mirna qpcr array data/fold increase  . in contrast, as seen in the in situ slides, there was a decrease in the expression levels of mir- <dig>  mir-135b, mir-135a and mir- <dig> from secretory-stage to maturation-stage tooth development . this trend of expression correlates well with the mirna qpcr array data  .figure  <dig>

lamp <dig> and tfrc are potential gene targets of mirna regulators
according to previous bioinformatic studies, mir- <dig> is a predicted regulator of lamp <dig>  while mir-490* is a predicted regulator of tfrc . however, these target predictions for differentially expressed mirnas were based mainly on human genome predictions; thus, we searched targetscan  for the predicted mirna regulators of these two genes within the mouse genome. we found that the prediction of mir- <dig> as the regulator of lamp1/lamp <dig> was consistent between the human and mouse genomes. however, mir-490* was not listed as one of the predicted regulators for mouse-specific tfrc. one of the mirnas identified as being highly up-regulated in maturation-stage enamel organ cells is mir- <dig> , and bioinformatic prediction identifies mir- <dig> as a potential regulator of tfrc in all vertebrate genomes. as a result, we decided to use mir- <dig> for subsequent in vitro verification that tfrc could be subjected to mirna regulation at some level in the mouse genome.

the expression levels of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in ls <dig> cells at different time points, following the transfection of corresponding mirna mimics or inhibitors, were first checked separately using quantitative real-time pcr. before ls <dig> cells were transfected by mir- <dig> mimics, the expression of mir- <dig> could not be detected . during the first 6 h after transfection with mir- <dig> mimics, there was a sharp increase in the intracellular level of mir- <dig>  which decreased continuously from 6 h through 48 h. at 48 h, the level of mir- <dig> returned to the original, non-detectable level. because there was almost no endogenous mir- <dig> expression, mir- <dig> inhibitors did not change the intracellular level of mir- <dig>  which remained at zero throughout the experiment . by comparison, a higher level of intracellular mir- <dig> was detected in ls <dig> cells before transfection with mir- <dig> mimics, indicating that mir- <dig> was intrinsically expressed in ls <dig> cells . the changes in the expression of intracellular mir- <dig> were relatively subtle following transfection with mir- <dig> mimics, while the introduction of mir- <dig> inhibitors repressed the intracellular mir- <dig> almost immediately  after transfection. the intracellular mir- <dig> level following transfection with the mir- <dig> inhibitors remained undetectable for the 48 h of observation.figure  <dig>

in the luciferase reporter assay, exogenously introduced mir- <dig> mimics caused a decrease of  <dig> % in the luciferase reporter activities  , indicating a direct interaction between the mir- <dig> mimics and the 3′-utr of exogenously added lamp <dig> . introduction of mir- <dig> inhibitors into lamp <dig> 3′-utr transfected ls <dig> cells failed to cause statistically significant changes in luciferase reporter activities  . this is consistent with the array analyses, in which mir- <dig> was down-regulated, and as a direct result lamp <dig> was up-regulated, during enamel maturation.

exogenously added mir- <dig> mimics showed a small inhibitory effect, however it was not statistically significant  . this may suggest that the initial levels of endogenous mir- <dig> are so high that the targeting activity of exogenous mir- <dig> mimics on the 3′-utr of tfrc is minimal. when mir- <dig> inhibitors were added to tfrc 3′-utr ls <dig> cells there was a  <dig> % increase in luciferase reporter activities  . taken together these results would suggest that the tfrc 3′-utr luciferase vector is functional, and that the mir- <dig> mimics effectively target the tfrc transcript. this data on mir- <dig> directed tfrc transcript down-regulation is also consistent with the gene expression microarray analyses, in which both tfrc and mir- <dig> were up-regulated during enamel maturation. that is, tfrc is up-regulated by approximately  <dig> fold during maturation , which is an extreme change in expression, and may require some “fine-tuning” and downward adjustments. the most immediate response from cells to fine-tune this tfrc transcriptional up-regulation may be to activate processes that target tfrc mrnas for degradation, which may include gene up-regulation of mir- <dig> transcription.

clearly, relating cell culture-based experiments to in vivo-derived data poses problems for interpretation, but these data sets for lamp <dig> and mir- <dig> interactions, as well as for tfrc and mir- <dig> interactions, warrant further investigation.

discussion
the involvement of mirnas in tooth development was first suggested in  <dig>  <cit> . since then, studies investigating mirna expression profiles during amelogenesis have covered mainly the early developmental stages of odontogenesis prior to the secretory and maturation stages of amelogenesis  <cit> . the bioinformatics analyses from these earlier murine and porcine studies have suggested that key roles of these stage- and/or tooth-specific mirnas relate primarily to cell differentiation, tooth morphogenesis and patterning  <cit> . in our study, we conducted genome-wide mirna expression profiling analysis in secretory- and maturation-stage enamel organs obtained from rats, and identified  <dig>  mirnas that were differentially expressed between secretory- and maturation-stage tooth development. this is consistent with the dynamic expression pattern of mirnas during tooth formation across species, as noted in prior studies  <cit> , indicating possible regulatory roles of mirnas in the later stages  of enamel development.

identifying target genes for mirnas is essential to connect the stage-specific mirna regulators to biological functions. computational prediction provides a tool to generate list of candidate mirna target genes . however, the list of predicted genes for mirnas can be intimidating , making it impractical for further investigation. to refine the number of predicted target genes for the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas, we conducted a parallel alignment analysis between the list of predicted genes and the list of stage-specific genes identified by genome-wide transcript expression profiling. the alignments generated three workable lists of predicted genes for the secretory- and maturation-stage-specific mirnas . these were up-regulated mirnas and their potential down-regulated mrna targets ; down-regulated mirnas and their potential up-regulated mrna targets ; and up-regulated mirnas and their most highly up-regulated potential mrna targets . recent studies demonstrated that a majority  of mammalian mirnas affect their gene targets at the mrna level by decreasing the stability of target mrnas  <cit>  and the method of pairing inversed expression profiles of mirnas and mrnas has been successfully used in previous mirna expression profiling studies . nevertheless, we were still at risk of including false positive candidates and/or excluding valid candidates from the final lists due to the intrinsic complexity of mirna regulation . another potential problem with mirna target prediction is that, because the genetic information about mirna target prediction is relatively sparse in rodents compared to humans, all procedures and software involved in target prediction are based on homologous human mirnas, that may also increase the false discovery and false negative rates.

the functions of ameloblasts during maturation-stage tooth development include matrix turnover, calcium handling, ph regulation and ion transport  <cit> . go analysis of the predicted gene targets for differentially expressed mirnas highlighted the functional categories that overlap with all the key processes during enamel maturation. for example, among the  <dig> genes significantly enriched in the category “endosome membrane” , up-regulation of cftr and lamp <dig> at both the mrna and protein levels  have been shown previously  <cit> . two other examples listed in table  <dig>  slc26a <dig> and tfrc, have also been confirmed as being up-regulated at both the mrna and protein levels  by our group . lamp <dig> and tfrc are considered to be the potential ameloblast membrane-bound receptors for emp debris , and are involved with trafficking between the plasma membrane and endosomal/lysosomal structures through associations with one or more adaptor protein complexes. cftr functions as a regulator of ph during rapid crystal growth and is critical for completion of enamel mineralization . cftr is expressed most highly in maturation-stage ameloblasts; furthermore, in cftr-deficient animals that exhibit hypomineralized enamel, only the maturation-stage ameloblasts are structurally affected . apart from these relatively well-studied genes, slc11a <dig> , which is involved in iron transport in epithelial tissues, is regulated by cd <dig> in maturation-stage ameloblasts  <cit> . another gene of note, listed in the category of “cytokine activity” , is wnt5a. wnt5a-induced cell death is crucial in determining the tooth size during murine tooth development  <cit> . in addition, enriched in the category “carboxylic acid transmembrane transporter activity” are  <dig> slc gene family members . the mrna expression levels of slc1a <dig>  slc6a <dig>  slc25a <dig>  slc26a <dig>  <cit>  and the other solute carrier  gene family members  are significantly up-regulated in the enamel organ cells during enamel maturation, and highlight the importance of slc-mediated chloride-bicarbonate exchange in enamel maturation. it is noteworthy that go analysis of the mirna-regulated genes indicated that  <dig> genes up-regulated during maturation stage genes were significantly enriched in the category of “calcium ion binding” , while  <dig> genes down-regulated during maturation stage were also enriched in the category of “calcium ion transmembrane transporter activity” . these data lend support to the complexity of genetic networks controlling enamel maturation, or even the whole process of amelogenesis.

experimental validation would be required for the identification of mirna target genes in vivo following computational prediction of mirna and mrna interaction. to date, there is still no consensus about the working schemes of experimental validation of mirna targets in vivo. however, in addition to computational prediction, at least three criteria should be met before confirming the mirna regulator for a given gene  <cit> : 1) mirna/mrna coexpression; 2) mirna effect on target proteins; 3) mirna effect on biological functions. while all of these criteria might not be met under all conditions, nevertheless it is advisable that as many be achieved as possible. in our efforts to validate the regulatory relations between lamp <dig> and mir- <dig>  as well as between tfrc and mir- <dig>  we first demonstrated the coexpression of mirnas and mrnas of target genes during maturation-stage development. in the case of lamp <dig> and mir- <dig> there was an inverse relationship, with higher lamp <dig> mrna levels and lower mir- <dig> levels noted in the maturation stage . in the case of tfrc and mir- <dig>  the highest levels of expression of both were noted in maturation-stage amelogenesis . the interaction between the seeding sequence of the mirna  and the 3′-utr of the target mrna  was predicted by targetscan, and the binding site of mir- <dig> to the mrna of tfrc was predicted to be highly conserved across vertebrates. the effects of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> on target proteins  was identified indirectly by the changes in luciferase reporter assays induced by exogenously introduced mimics and inhibitors of corresponding mirnas into the host cells . the experiments seeking to confirm the effects of these mirnas on biological functions is not possible at this stage due to a lack of suitable animal models and/or appropriate organ culture systems. as part of our future approach to studying the role of mirnas in amelogenesis, gain-of-function or loss-of-function studies of mirnas should be considered in suitable primary organ cultures or with the development of appropriate animal models. a caveat about investigating the functional role of mirnas is that there can be functional redundancy among mirnas. for example, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> facilitate invasion and metastasis of colon carcinoma cells by suppressing the same target tiam <dig> in tgf-β signaling pathway  <cit> . in human natural regulatory t cell foxp <dig> expression is affected by both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  although the regulation of mir- <dig> is indirect  <cit> . thus loss-of-function of a single mirna, especially the one of multi-gene family may not result in an aberrant phenotype  <cit> .

finally, it has been a widely accepted concept that gene expression regulation is controlled by various factors at protein and rna levels  <cit> . although the key role of mirna regulation has been suggested in multiple biological processes and diseases, it cannot be the only contributor to the intrinsic complexity of regulatory networks. in our study,  <dig> genes  showed differential expression during maturation-stage tooth development. among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes were predicted to be regulated by the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas . on the other hand, the remaining stably expressed mirnas were predicted to be the regulators of  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes . these data suggested that genetic regulators other than mirnas, such as transcription factors, must be dominant players in the processes of enamel maturation. in the ipa core analysis of the mirna-regulated candidate gene lists , the potential transcription factors were predicted . it is highly possible that mirnas and transcription factors co-regulated the expression of these two groups of target genes, in forms of feed-forward loops  and feedback loops  .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, mirnas are dynamically expressed when tooth development transitions from the secretory stage to the maturation stage, and the differentially expressed mirnas likely play a role in the regulation of enamel maturation events by targeting genes involved in specific activities such as ph regulation, ion transport, endocytosis and apoptosis. the data presented here should help identify the roles of individual mirnas in amelogenesis, and more generally help to clarify the potential roles of mirna-centered regulatory mechanisms in mineralized tissues. our data also suggest additional experiments to establish causal relationships between mirna and mrna levels in genetically modified cell culture and animal models are warranted. recognition of mirna-related regulation and the functions of corresponding target genes during enamel development may also shed light on clinical diagnosis and/or treatment of diseases such as amelogenesis imperfecta.
