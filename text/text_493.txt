BACKGROUND
sars-cov is a single-stranded, plus-sense rna virus with a genome of ~ <dig> kb. its sequence does not closely resemble any of the previously characterized coronaviruses  <cit> . before sars-cov was recognized as the cause of the deadly sars  <cit> , other human coronaviruses had only been known to account for 15â€“30% of colds  <cit> . sars-cov appears to be new to humans, as supported by the finding that human sera collected before the sars outbreak did not contain antibodies against this virus  <cit> . after an incubation period from  <dig> to  <dig> days, sars patients might develop fever , headache, dry cough, and pneumonia  <cit> . most patients gradually recovered while some progressed to respiratory distress syndrome with ~10% mortality rate. the genome-wide changes in human gene expression when challenged by this novel pathogen are essentially unknown.

profiles of gene expression patterns help define the complex biological processes associated with both health and disease in vivo. investigation of host responses to infection with in vitro models have offered insights into mechanisms of pathogenesis, and have highlighted the potential for applications of microarray technology to diagnose infection in vivo  <cit> . whitney et al. observed that the variation in gene expression patterns in the blood of healthy subjects was strikingly smaller than the significant changes induced by diseases either in patients with cancer or with bacterial infections  <cit> . it was conceivable that microarray profiling of gene expression in whole bloods exhibits the potential in monitoring the patients' responses to a disease, especially a novel infection such as sars.

many discriminative methods have been developed for analysis of microarray gene expression data in cancer patients and the resulting classifications have been correlated closely with clinical parameters  <cit> . for instance, the discovery of signature genes for breast cancers through microarray analysis of gene expression has provided us with a more precise clinical staging that will improve the outcome of treatment  <cit> . however, clinical parameters are not always in a discrete pattern but more likely in a continuous fashion, where an absolute classification may not be achievable. herein we present the use of cdna microarray analysis of gene expression in whole blood from a cohort of recovering sars patients, of whom the disease severity appeared to be a continuum. after we had identified the molecular signature of  <dig> genes that accurately discriminated acute sars patients from non-sars controls, we ranked the disease severity of these patients using a generalized association plot  elliptical seriation algorithm  <cit>  based on the expression profiles of the  <dig> genes. the derived severity rank of the patients proved to be closely correlated with their clinical parameters, namely, the recovery period  and the clinical pulmonary infection score.

RESULTS
patient information
using the cdna microarrays spotted with duplicated  <dig>  cdna clone, we analyzed rna specimens successfully amplified in  <dig> peripheral blood collected from  <dig> confirmed sars patients , of whom  <dig> survived. except for one patient who died on the 4th day, duration of hospitalization in this cohort ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> days  . we defined  <dig> specimens as acute sars  using the following criteria:  the whole blood rna from a hospitalized patient was pcr positive for sars-cov, or  the specimen was collected within  <dig> days after the disease onset in patients whose blood was later diagnosed elisa-positive for anti-sars igg. the rest of  <dig> rna specimens from sars patients were labelled as recovering sars . our study included  <dig> normal control  volunteers and  <dig> patients with bacterial infections  as healthy and non-sars infection controls, respectively .

cdna microarray analysis
when we compared the gene expression profiles among acute sars , recovering sars , bacterial infection , and normal control  groups, we observed the variances of gene expression in both sars  and bacterial  groups to be equally higher than that in healthy controls  . this result indicates that gene expression profiles of either sars or bacterial groups differed significantly from that of normal controls.

a probe set of  <dig> genes with standard deviations greater than  <dig>  across  <dig> arrays was selected for further analyses. an average linkage hierarchical clustering tree with pearson correlation proximity was built on the  <dig> arrays  using these  <dig> genes . the as and nc groups were well separated into two opposite coherent clusters. singular value decomposition  analysis, a dimension reduction method to project gene expression profiles to fewer representative eigenvectors  <cit> , also successfully separated as, in, and nc specimens into three clusters with first two eigenvectors . interestingly, the recovering sars  samples are interspersed among the as and in samples.

to identify which genes were specifically regulated by sars-cov, we performed two sets of two-sample student t-test for means with an unequal-variance assumption. in the first set, we contrasted  <dig> as versus  <dig> non-as  specimens on all  <dig> genes. the genes with significant testing results were considered to be specifically induced by sars-cov . for the second set of t-tests, we compared  <dig> nc with  <dig> non-nc  specimens. we considered that the change in significant genes identified by the second t-test was induced by both bacterial and viral infections . genes identified from these two sets of test were then ranked separately according to the corresponding sets of p-values. gene expression profiles for the top  <dig> and the bottom  <dig> genes from both sets are displayed as figure  <dig> 

unexpectedly, most of the genes specifically upreguated by sars-cov are ests  that were not annotated previously . on the other hand, sars-cov stimulated the host innate immunity by upregulating genes including defensins  <cit>  and eosinophil derived neurotoxin  <cit> , similar to that of bacterial infections .

signature genes and gap algorithms
a simple k-nearest-neighbour method was used to obtain a near optimal number of  <dig> genes from the  <dig> filtered gene set for discriminating specimens between acute sars  and non-sars  . the selected top  <dig> upregulated  and the top  <dig> downregulated genes  from the as versus non-as  student's t-test were used as the specific probe set to assess the status of sars infection. eight genes that were also significant in the nc versus non-nc  t-test were excluded, resulting in a specific as probe set of  <dig> genes. for the gap analysis, we calculated pair-wise euclidean distances among  <dig> samples  using these  <dig> genes, aiming to identify a one-dimensional order that could reflect the severity structure of the disease . using this gap elliptical arrangement of  <dig> specimens , we observed a transition of gene expression patterns of  <dig> genes  from the left side where nc clustered to the right side where as accumulated . hierarchical clustering trees guided by self-organized map  and other clustering methods were also performed to sort the sars patient samples using the same  <dig> genes. the robinson criterion  <cit>  is often employed to assess the performances of different seriation algorithms. table  <dig>  shows that the gap algorithm derived a smoother transition pattern than other methods in the robinson sense. thereby, we have derived the sars severity rank according to the expression profile of  <dig> signature genes as a whole in each patient, as demonstrated by the smooth transition of expression levels in each  of these genes from nc to rs to as .

for validation purposes, we further tested the stability of the rank  derived from gap analysis on the  <dig> genes for the  <dig> specimens. the same gap procedure was repeatedly applied to the top  <dig> to  <dig> genes  with significant p-values  between the as versus non-as . while the ranks for the  <dig> specimens obtained from the most significant  <dig> to  <dig> genes are highly correlated to each other, they are significantly different from the ranks derived from the 52-gene sets that were randomly selected from the  <dig> genes .

we scrutinized the clinical courses of patients who donated the  <dig> rs specimens that were scattered among as  and found evidence of underlying severity of the disease in the majority of patients. for example, sample rs <dig> from a patient who had been discharged from hospital for  <dig> weeks was still pcr-positive for sars-cov; rs <dig>  a pcr-positive sample was not grouped as as because of the negative elisa result. rs <dig>  rs <dig>  and rs <dig> still represented acute sars infections because they were collected only  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days after as <dig>  as <dig>  and as <dig>  respectively. patients with rs <dig> and rs <dig> who had severe sars courses were hospitalized for  <dig> and  <dig> days, respectively. the patient for rs <dig> was in the second week of disease. the only two unexplained specimens, rs <dig> and rs <dig> from the same patient, may represent a unique biological variability, accounting for the misclassification using this 52-gene molecular signature.

molecular signature for severity and clinical correlations
to test the efficacy of using these  <dig> genes as the molecular signature for the severity of sars patients, we identified a significant correlation  between the derived rank of sars severity and the number of days after the onset of disease . we further used this rank of sars severity to examine the recovery trend in  <dig> recovering patients who had donated multiple specimens . except for the one patient , similar trends existed in  <dig> out of  <dig> lines . pugin et al. combined body temperature, white blood cell count, volume and appearance of tracheal secretions, oxygenation, chest x-ray, and tracheal aspirate cultures into a clinical pulmonary infection score  as a diagnostic tool for pneumonia  <cit> . we observed that the rank of sars severity was also significantly  correlated with the cpis . collectively, these results demonstrate a correlation between the molecular severity rank and clinical factors, suggesting the usefulness of the molecular signature as a genome-wide parameter for gauging the severity of sars patients.

discussion
diverse infections can induce a shared core gene expression involving the human innate immune system; each infection may also trigger a pathogen-specific immune response of the host. the innate immune genes were upregulated in both acute sars  and bacteria infection  patients . sars was a novel viral infection that had not been encountered by the humans in the history before  <dig>  intriguingly, most of the genes specifically upreguated in sars patients were ests  , suggesting that the first human encounter with sars-cov might provoke a set of human genes that were poorly annotated due to disuse. annotation of these ests may lead to the discovery of novel genes.

given the high cost of microarray analyses, the detection of a comprehensive gene expression profile may not be cost-effective for clinical diagnosis and evaluation of patients with infectious diseases. however, in a complex system such as the human body where genes interplay through intricate circuitries, it is inadequate to examine only a few routine parameters in biochemistry and blood cell counts for the global physiochemical status of a patient at the time of blood collection. in this report, we applied the gap method to derive a smooth transition pattern among samples based on the molecular signature consisting of  <dig> genes, which in turn were used to monitor the severity of clinical courses of sars patients. instead of clustering samples into discrete groups in a method similar to commonly-used microarray classifications  <cit> , gap focuses more on a global orientation of the sample-to-sample relationship. for instance, the as and rs samples were seriation ranked , and the rank order proved to correlate well with clinical parameters .

the gap-derived rank of severity also provided us with a unique way, where expression of most relevant genes were all considered, to decipher the meaning of the changes in other genes obtained from the same microarray experiment. for instance, we have identified the correlative change in matrix metalloproteinase mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> : both can stimulate Î±-defensin  <cit> . importantly, these correlations could not be revealed with other parameters alone, such as number of days after disease onset or clinical score cpis .

in this study, however, there might be technical limitations during rna isolation from some clinical specimens as well as an unavoidable sample-collecting bias. first, both rna isolation from sars specimens and rna amplification were performed in the biosafety level  <dig> laboratory, where the instrument for rna quantitation was not available. this limitation resulted in the failed generation of arna from  <dig> out of  <dig> sars specimens . unfortunately, these  <dig> specimens contained  <dig> specimens from patients at an early  stage  <cit> . secondly,  <dig> sars patients who donated blood specimens for this study may belong to the milder subgroup of a total of  <dig> sars patients in kaohsiung medical center of chang gung memorial hospital. according to a paper describing the complete cohort of sars patients  <cit> , intubation and mechanical ventilation were required in  <dig> out of these  <dig> patients. however, only two in our  <dig> patients needed intubation . the aforementioned two potential limitations may account for why our microarray results could not detect a correlation with a possible worsening clinical course before recovering, which was described by peiris et al  <cit> .

in conclusion, we propose the use of a molecular signature reflecting the severity of sars in order to interpret the trends of expression changes in groups of genes within particular functional categories. the use of gap methodology proved to be instrumental in determining the severity of sars. the derived severity ranking of sars patients in turn formed a gradual basis for the analysis of the interaction patterns, providing us with a useful tool for understanding the molecular pathogenesis of this novel viral infection.

CONCLUSIONS
we illuminate the human gene expression profiles, in terms of gene expression in peripheral blood, to the unprecedented infection of sars-cov. we also discovered a smooth transition pattern of severity from normal controls to acute sars patients based on the gene expression profiles by generalized associate plots . the rank of sars severity was significantly correlated with other clinical parameters.
