BACKGROUND
meat quality in chickens is an important trait and includes ph, meat color, drip loss, tenderness, intramuscular fat  content, and other fat traits such as the contents and proportions of abdominal and subcutaneous fat. the selection of broiler chickens, initially focused on increasing growth performance and improving body composition  <cit> , also led to indirect and often deleterious effects on meat quality traits, particularly excessive deposition of abdominal fat , the formation of which represents inefficient use of feed  <cit> . the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying meat quality traits in chickens will have both biological and economic consequences.

quantitative trait loci  for many traits in chicken have been studied for over 20 years;  <dig> qtls for meat-quality traits and  <dig> for abdominal fat traits have been detected in a variety of chicken chromosomal regions  <cit> . these qtls were detected by linkage analysis and by candidate gene analysis. both of these methods have limitations: the identified qtl regions are generally large and require subsequent fine mapping to identify closely linked markers or causative variants. candidate genes, based on putative physiological roles, may exclude the identification of novel genes or pathways that influence the target traits  <cit> .

the currently available chicken 60 k snp chip covers the entire genome  <cit> . genome-wide association studies  can aid in more precisely identifying the genes and variants underlying important traits. in chicken, gwas have already been performed for growth  <cit> , egg production and quality  <cit>  and disease resistance  <cit> . in the present study, we have performed a gwas of several meat-quality traits in an f <dig> resource population derived from a cross between a chinese local breed  and a commercial rapidly-growing broiler line  to identify candidate genes.

gwas analysis
a total of  <dig>  independent snp markers, distributed on all autosomes, were obtained with r2 =  <dig>  multidimensional scaling  analysis of these snps using the first two principal components  indicated that chickens within each full-sib family were clustered together. to correct for population stratification, the first mds component was used as a covariate in a general linear model  and a compressed mixed linear model , as suggested in previous studies  <cit> . the relative kinship matrix was constructed from these independent snp markers as a random effect in the compressed mlm.

as observed in figure  <dig>  the compressed mlm is more effective than the glm for controlling population structure, as described in previous studies  <cit> . the compressed mlm was, therefore, the preferred model to identify association signals. in addition, the compressed mlm also increases false negatives while false positives are reduced  <cit> . the suggestive significance threshold for p-value was set at  <dig>  × 10- <dig> in the mlm analyses and those reaching genome-wide significance  from the glm analysis are also indicated. the  <dig> snps with association signals  are listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig> and manhattan plots are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> and additional file 1: figure s <dig>  seven of the  <dig> reached genome-wide significance based on the glm analysis.

dry matter content in breast  and 
two snps were associated with dmbr . they were located at  <dig>  mb on chicken  chromosome z  and  <dig>  mb on gga <dig>  within the genes for st <dig> alpha-n-acetyl-neuraminide alpha- <dig> -sialyltransferase  <dig>  and family with sequence similarity  <dig>  member a , respectively. one snp , located at  <dig>  mb on gga <dig>  was associated with dmth  and was located  <dig>  kb downstream from the tbc <dig> domain family member  <dig> gene .

intramuscular fat content in breast muscle 
genes related to lipid metabolism would be predicted to influence imfbr. five snps associated with this trait were identified by the compressed mlm , of which three were of genome-wide significance by glm analysis . one snp , located at  <dig>  mb on ggz, had highly significant association with imfbr  and is located  <dig>  kb upstream of the kinesin heavy chain member 2a  gene. another snp , located at  <dig>  mb on gga <dig>  was also associated with imfbr  and is located  <dig>  kb upstream of the aspartylglucosaminidase  gene. three more snps  having association with imfbr were in the proximity of protein tyrosine kinase , microsomal glutathione s-transferase  <dig>  and nucleoside-triphosphatase, cancer-related  genes, on gga <dig>  gga <dig> and gga <dig>  respectively.

meat color traits
three snps were associated with meat color lightness  . one snp, located at  <dig>  mb on gga <dig>  is  <dig>  kb away from the collagen, type i, alpha  <dig>  gene. the other two snps are located within the  <dig>  mb segment  on gga <dig>  these snps are approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb away from the proteasome  26s subunit, non-atpase,  <dig>  and karyopherin alpha  <dig>   genes, respectively. the snp , located at  <dig>  mb on gga <dig>  was associated  with meat color b*; the nearest gene, ftsj homolog  <dig>   gene, is located  <dig>  kb upstream.

skin color traits
four snps were found to be associated with skin color l* . one, located at  <dig>  mb on gga <dig>  is  <dig>  kb upstream of the tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type  <dig>  gene. the snp identified on gga <dig> is  <dig>  kb head of the phosphogluconate dehydrogenase  gene. two snps, located within a  <dig>  mb segment  on gga <dig>  are approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb ahead of the serine peptidase inhibitor, kazal type  <dig>  and clathrin interactor  <dig>  genes, respectively.

the snp gga_rs <dig> on gga <dig> was associated with skin a* , and is located distal  to a microrna cluster that includes three micrornas . another snp, ggaluga <dig>  located at  <dig>  mb on gga <dig>  was associated with skin b* . the known gene nearest to this snp  is budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles  <dig> homolog  .

abdominal fat  traits
variants at  <dig> loci were identified as snps associated with abf traits by compressed mlm , and four were of genome-wide significance by glm  . two snps  located within a  <dig>  kb region on gga <dig> were associated with abfw ; these snps are both downstream  of the max-interacting transcriptional repressor mad <dig>  gene. the snp gga_rs <dig> was also associated with abfp . another snp , located at  <dig>  mb on gga <dig>  was associated with both abfw and abfp . this snp is  <dig>  kb away from the nearest known gene, loc <dig>  which encodes prolactin-releasing peptide receptor-like protein , also known as g-protein coupled receptor  <dig> . snp gga_rs <dig>  located at  <dig>  mb on gga <dig>  is  <dig>  kb downstream of collagen, type xii, alpha  <dig>  and was associated with abfw . notably, a snp  within the ret proto-oncogene  gene on gga <dig>  was associated with both abfw and abfp .

three snps located within a  <dig>  mb region between  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb on gga <dig> were associated with abfp . one of these snps is  <dig>  kb upstream of the vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4b  gene, and another is approximately  <dig>  kb away from the known b-cell lymphoma  <dig>  gene. the third snp is located  <dig>  kb upstream of the forkhead box c <dig>  gene. on gga <dig>  two snps were associated with abfp . these snps are within  <dig>  kb of the natriuretic peptide b  gene. another snp, located at  <dig>  kb on gga <dig>  was associated with abfp and is  <dig>  kb away from the nearest known gene, br serine/threonine kinase  <dig> . interestingly, one snp located at  <dig>  mb on gga <dig> was associated with abfp and is  <dig>  kb downstream from the gene for adipocyte determination- and differentiation-dependent factor  <dig>  the sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor  <dig> .

no snps were found to be associated with imfth, sft, phu, dl, sf and meat color a* of breast muscle.

the mrna expression study of candidate genes identified by the gwas
based on the gwas analysis,  <dig> candidate genes containing or in proximity of snps with trait association were further evaluated by real-time quantitative pcr  in subsets of six chickens with lowest or highest trait phenotypic values . significant differential expression  between the low and high birds was demonstrated for  <dig> of the  <dig> .

1high group  consisting of samples from chicken with the highest trait values and low group  with the lowest trait values; * p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> .

for imfbr, transcript abundance of four  genes identified near significant snps was significantly down-regulated in the high group compared to the low group ; the differentially expressed genes were kif2a, tyro <dig>  mgst <dig> and ntpcr.

for meat color l*, three of four chosen genes were differentially expressed between low and high phenotypic groups . transcript abundance of col1a <dig> and psmd <dig> was significantly down-regulated in the high group , and that of kpna <dig> was significantly higher .

of the eight genes identified in connection with abf traits, seven were differentially expressed between the low and high group . compared to the low group, the expression of ret and nppb was significantly increased , and that of col12a <dig>  vps4b, brsk <dig>  foxc <dig> and srebf was decreased  in the high group.

discussion
genome-wide association analysis
there has been effective use of gwas in meat quality and carcass traits in other species and narrow regions or snps associated with pork and beef quality have been revealed  <cit> . here, we present a gwas of meat quality traits in an f <dig> chicken population derived from a cross of beijing-you chickens and commercial fast-growing broilers.

meat quality traits
dry matter content  is a primary muscle characteristic. nones et al.  mapped a qtl for the water content  of a chicken carcass at 23 cm on gga <dig> in a half-sib linkage analysis  <cit> . in the present study, two loci for dm content in breast muscle  and one for dmth have been identified. two snps within st8sia <dig> and fam105a genes were associated with dmbr. st8sia <dig> encodes a type ii membrane protein, a member of glycosyltransferase family  <dig> playing a role in the synthesis of some gangliosides and having a function in cellular recognition and cell-to-cell communication  <cit> . the pro-apoptotic gene fam105a, when overexpressed, leads to cell apoptosis  <cit> . a snp near tbc1d <dig> was identified to be associated with dmth. this gene encodes a protein with a conserved domain, the tbc domain, common in proteins interacting with gtpases and has been related to endocytic trafficking  <cit> . function characterization of these genes, near snps associated with muscle dm in chickens, is not yet clear.

intramuscular fat  is an important determinant of meat quality influencing the tenderness, juiciness and flavour of meat  <cit> . in the present study, four genes  are shown to be potentially related to imfbr. these genes were all differentially expressed in chickens with low and high imfbr , and some are known to play roles in lipid metabolism. tyro <dig> plays an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation and has been associated with adipocyte size in moderately obese individuals in a clinical study  <cit> . the protein encoded by mgst <dig> catalyses the conjugation of glutathione to electrophiles and the reduction of lipid hydroperoxides. this gene was differentially expressed in the longissimus dorsi of northeastern indigenous and large white pigs  <cit>  and was previously identified in a qtl for chicken imfbr <cit> . kif2a encodes the kinesin-like protein kif2a, a microtubule-associated motor protein. it can regulate microtubule dynamics at the growth cone edge by depolymerizing microtubules and plays a role in the suppression of collateral branch extension  <cit> . ntpcr is a cancer-related gene with a presumed role in human tumorigenesis  <cit> . no previous studies have linked kif2a or ntpcr with imfbr and, as the associations were strong  and the differential expression was quite large, further study of these genes seems to be warranted.

meat color is an important quality that influences consumer acceptance of poultry meat and has significant positive correlations with ph and water-holding capacity  <cit> . le bihan-duval et al.  identified an influence of beta-carotene dioxygenase  <dig>  on chicken breast meat color using classical qtl analysis and gene expression qtl   <cit> . in the present study, we did not observe an influence of bcdo <dig> on meat color, probably because a different chicken population was tested. three new genes for breast meat color were expressed differentially between the high and low phenotypic groups. col1a <dig>  which encodes one of the chains of type i collagen, was differentially expressed here  and also between the red and white skeletal muscles of chinese meishan pigs  <cit> ; this gene could well be a candidate gene for meat color in chickens. psmd <dig>  encoding a proteasomal regulatory subunit, has been associated with liver function in humans  <cit> . kpna <dig> encodes an importin, functioning in retrograde transport of signaling molecules from the axonal growth cone to the nucleus  <cit> . how the psmd <dig> and kpna <dig> genes might function in influencing meat color in chickens is not known.

the color of chicken skin influences consumer appeal and hence is also an important phenotype. a previous study found that yellow skin was caused by one or more cis-acting and tissue-specific regulatory mutation that inhibit expression of bcdo <dig> in the skin  <cit> . six snps were identified here as being associated with skin color but the only one associated with yellowness was near the bub <dig> gene, with unknown function in chickens. one of genes with known effects on skin color, close to a snp of significance, is spink <dig>  the skin of spink5-deficient mice has large intensely blue areas close to colorless regions  <cit> .

abdominal fat traits
in addition to imf, other fat traits, and especially abdominal fat, are important selection criteria in chicken breeding. abdominal fat  is under complex genetic control and has medium heritability  in one of the founding breeds used here  <cit> . as the trait is economically important but requires post-slaughter measurement, marker-assisted selection could be a more efficient method for genetic selection. abdominal fat traits have been a focus of qtl mapping studies of chickens and several chromosomes are involved  <cit> .

seven genes  containing or near snps associated with abdominal fat traits, identified here, had significant different expression in abf from cohorts of birds with highest and lowest abf content. three of the genes, ret, nppb and srebf <dig>  are known to be related to lipid metabolism in other species. ret increases lipid accumulation in humans, based on a high-throughput sirna screen with primary adipocytes  <cit> . in the present study, ret transcripts were profoundly increased in chickens with high abfw compared to those in the low group. even more striking was the 72-fold increased abundance of nppb transcripts in birds with high abfp. natriuretic peptide b is implicated in a variety of actions  <cit> , including an important role in obesity and insulin resistance  <cit> . srebf <dig> encodes a transcription factor with roles in adipocyte differentiation and regulation of lipogenesis  <cit> . expression of this gene was greatly diminished in the chickens with high abfp and it is expressed at lower levels in adipose tissue from obese human subjects  <cit> .

expression of the other genes examined  was significantly lower in chickens with high abfw or abfp, though the magnitude of the differential expression was less.

the authors are aware that these traits, measured here at d  <dig> for their relevance to chicken meat production, reflect cumulative cellular, developmental and metabolic processes, some of which are set in place at much earlier stages. the leads provided by the present gwas, and general verification by the expression analyses comparing phenotypic extremes, now require a systematic ontogenic analysis from before hatching, where feasible. in the case of adipose tissue, which is non-discernible pre-hatch, attempts to functionally characterize the relevant genes may be possible with preadipocytes, differentiated in vitro.

the present approach has used gwas and mrna expression analysis to identify loci and genes influencing meat quality traits in chicken. fine mapping of causal variants in these associated regions and more thorough functional characterization of these genes will be required, using systematic post-gwas strategies  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present gwas has exposed a total of  <dig> snps having significant association with ten meat quality traits . of the  <dig> genes near the snps associated with imfbr, meat l*, b* values and abf,  <dig> were differentially expressed in breast muscle or abdominal fat among subsets of chickens with lowest and highest phenotypic values. these results provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying meat quality traits in chickens.
