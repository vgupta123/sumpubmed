BACKGROUND
methicillin resistant s. aureus  are an ever increasing threat, both in clinical settings and more recently as an emerging community acquired pathogen. their invasiveness and pathogenesis relies on a variable arsenal of virulence factors, paired with resistance to virtually all β-lactams and their derivatives. their ability to rapidly generate resistance to other unrelated classes of antibiotics, or to take up additional resistance determinants, severely hampers therapy and eradication.

in s. aureus, methicillin resistance is conferred by an acquired, β-lactam-insensitive penicillin-binding protein , pbp2a  <cit> . pbp2a is encoded by meca, which is divergently transcribed from its cognate regulators, mecr <dig>  and meci . if mecr1-meci are absent or truncated, transcriptional control of meca is taken over by the structurally similar blaz  regulatory elements blar1/blai, if present. in the absence of both regulatory loci, meca is constitutively transcribed  <cit> . in the presence of β-lactams, the transmembrane sensor/signal transducers blar1/mecr <dig>  undergo a conformational change, followed by autoproteolytic cleavage of the n-terminal cytoplasmic domain, leading to the activation of the cytoplasmic peptidase and subsequent dissociation of the repressor due to proteolytic degradation  <cit> . however, the signal transduction cascade of this regulatory system has still not been completely elucidated.

oxacillin resistance levels conferred by meca are strain specific and can vary greatly, with oxacillin minimal inhibitory concentrations  of different strains ranging from phenotypically susceptible levels, as low as  <dig> μg/ml up to extremely high values of >  <dig> μg/ml. methicillin resistance is also generally expressed heterogeneously. heterogeneously resistant mrsa, when exposed to β-lactam antibiotics, segregate highly resistant subpopulations, which are much more resistant than the majority of the cells  <cit> . the frequency of highly resistant subclones generated is often well above the spontaneous mutation frequency, and once selected high level resistance often remains stable, even in the absence of selective pressure. there is currently no satisfactory genetic model which explains how these higher resistance levels are triggered or selected and exactly what factors are functionally responsible for the increased resistance in clinical isolates. methicillin resistance levels are known to not directly correlate with meca transcription or levels of pbp2a produced  <cit> . however, resistance levels can be manipulated by environmental conditions, such as temperature, ph, osmolarity, and medium composition  <cit> .

it has been shown experimentally, that in addition to meca, methicillin resistance depends on the correct interplay of a multitude of genomic factors, termed fem/aux factors, including genes involved in peptidoglycan precursor formation, composition and turnover; teichoic acid synthesis; and genes of unknown or poorly characterised functions  <cit> . in addition to structural genes, many regulatory loci have also been shown to influence resistance levels, including global regulators of virulence factor production such as the quorum sensing agr system, the staphylococcal accessory regulator sara and the alternate sigma factor σb  <cit> ; regulators of metabolism, such as the catabolite control protein a   <cit> ; and the vrasr two-component sensor transducer, which induces the cell wall stress stimulon in response to cell wall active antibiotic challenge  <cit> .

the vast mic differences between mrsa strains, the population heterogeneity within single strains and the dependence of resistance levels on external factors are reflected in these many structural genes and global regulators, which can influence resistance levels.

while typically considered nosocomial pathogens, new faster growing and apparently more virulent mrsa have begun spreading in the community. interestingly, these emerging strains often express very low methicillin resistance, e.g. the mrsa clone spreading amongst intravenous drug users in the zurich area, which has an in vitro doubling time of  <dig> min, but oxacillin mics of only  <dig>  to  <dig> μg/ml  <cit> . this particular clone's low-level resistance is partially due to a promoter mutation, leading to tight repression of meca, but resistance levels appear to be mainly restricted by unknown factors within its genomic background  <cit> .

to identify potential factors involved in meca regulation or methicillin resistance levels in such an extremely low level resistant mrsa, we performed dna-binding protein purification assays, using the meca operator region as bait. a novel, uncharacterized protein, sa <dig>  was found to bind to this dna fragment, and shown to increase methicillin resistance levels when deleted.

RESULTS
identification of sa1665
mrsa strain che <dig> is the type strain for the so-called "drug clone" spreading amongst intravenous drug users in the zurich area  <cit> . this strain carries meca and expresses pbp2a, but appears phenotypically methicillin susceptible by conventional phenotypic tests. however, like most other low-level resistant mrsa, it can segregate a small proportion of higher resistant subclones in the presence of β-lactams. we hypothesized that regulation of methicillin resistance in such low-level resistant clonal lineages may differ qualitatively from classical heterogeneously- or highly-resistant mrsa.

a dna-binding protein purification assay was performed to identify new potential factors involved in the regulation of meca/pbp2a. the meca/mecr <dig> intergenic dna region, including the 5'  <dig> bp of mecr <dig> and the first  <dig> bp of meca, was used as bait against crude protein extract from strain che <dig>  proteins binding to this dna fragment were analysed by sds-page. even though che <dig> contained blai, which is known to bind to the mec operator, this band could not be identified on gels due to co-migrating, non-specific bands the same size as blai  that bound to both the dna-coated and uncoated control beads. the most prominent protein band of ~16– <dig> kda, isolated from dna-labelled but not from control beads, was identified as the hypothetical protein sa <dig>  . sa <dig> encodes a predicted 17-kda protein with an n-terminal helix-turn-helix  motif characteristic of dna-binding transcriptional regulators. the amino acid sequence of sa <dig> showed 100% identity amongst s. aureus database sequences and 97–98% identity amongst other staphylococci, including s. haemolyticus, s. epidermidis and s. saprophyticus, indicating that sa <dig> is highly conserved. conversely, there were no orfs highly similar to sa <dig> found in other bacterial species, with the most similar sequences found in bacillus licheniformis dsm <dig> and desulfitobacterium hafniense y <dig>  which shared only 64% and 59% similarity, respectively.

electro mobility shift assays 
emsa was used to confirm binding of sa <dig> to the mec operator region. crude protein extracts of e. coli strain bl <dig>  carrying the empty plasmid  or pme <dig>  which expressed nhis6-sa <dig> upon induction with iptg, were incubated with the 161-bp biotinylated-dna fragment previously used as bait in the dna-binding protein assay. a band shift was observed with extracts from the strain expressing recombinant nhis6-sa <dig> but not from the control strain carrying the empty plasmid. several bands resulted from the shift, which is most likely due to protein oligomerisation . the specificity of the gel shift was also demonstrated by the addition of increasing concentrations of purified nhis6-sa <dig> protein to the biotinylated-dna fragment . band-shift of the biotinylated dna was inhibited in the presence of specific competitor dna but not by the presence of the non-specific competitor dna, confirming that nhis6-sa <dig> had a specific binding affinity for the 161-bp dna fragment.

effect of sa <dig> deletion on β-lactam resistance
to analyse the effect of sa <dig> inactivation on methicillin resistance, nonpolar markerless deletions of sa <dig>  were constructed in a selection of clinical mrsa isolates, which varied in their genetic background, sccmec type, and meca regulation  <cit> . strain che <dig>  belongs to clonal complex cc <dig> and sequence type st <dig>  and contains a novel sccmec ; while strains zh <dig>  and zh <dig>  contain type iv sccmecs. all three of these strains have truncated meci/mecr <dig> regulatory loci but intact blai/blar <dig> loci controlling meca expression. strain zh <dig>  contained a type a mec complex  within a type ii sccmec, and had no β-lactamase locus; so meca was only under the control of its cognate regulators meci/mecr <dig> 

deletion of sa <dig> increased oxacillin resistance in all mutants compared to their corresponding parent strains, as demonstrated on oxacillin gradient plates ; with mutants Δche <dig> and Δzh <dig> approximately doubling in resistance and Δzh <dig> and Δzh <dig> expressing considerably higher resistance. population analysis resistance profiles of the mutants showed a distinct shift at the top of the curve, indicating that the higher resistance was due to increased basal oxacillin resistance levels . strains che482/Δche <dig> and zh37/Δzh <dig> had very similar resistance profiles, despite having different sccmec elements, suggesting that it was their common clonal background  that determined their resistance levels and the extent of resistance increase upon sa <dig> deletion.

growth curve analyses showed that deletion of sa <dig> slightly reduced the growth rate of all strains tested . wild type growth rates were restored upon complementation .

resistance complementation
plasmids pme <dig> and pme <dig> were constructed for complementation of the deletion mutants. both plasmids contained the sa <dig> orf along with its own promoter and transcriptional terminator. strains Δche <dig>  Δzh <dig>  and Δzh <dig> were complemented with pme <dig>  and intrinsically kanamycin resistant strain Δzh <dig> was complemented with pme <dig>  wild type-like resistance levels were restored in all mutants by introduction of the complementing plasmids, as shown by gradient plates .

transcriptional analyses
primer extension, using the 5'-biotinylated primer me <dig>  identified two potential sa <dig> transcriptional start sites , 76-nt and 139-nt upstream of the sa <dig> atg start codon . predicted σa promoter consensus -10/- <dig> box sequences were located upstream of both tss . identical tss were also identified using the downstream primer me <dig> .

northern blot analysis was used to investigate sa <dig> expression and the influence of sa <dig> deletion on meca and mecr <dig> transcription. rna samples taken from different time points over the growth curve of che <dig> showed that sa <dig> was expressed strongly in early exponential phase at od <dig> nm  <dig>  and  <dig> , then transcript levels decreased and were almost undetectable in early stationary phase at od <dig> nm  <dig>  . in addition to the main transcript of ~ <dig>  kb, a weaker, larger transcript of ~ <dig>  kb was also visible, especially at later growth stages. figure 5b shows the transcriptional behaviour of sa <dig> when che <dig> cells were challenged with sub-inhibitory  and inhibitory  concentrations of cefoxitin. these results showed that low levels of cefoxitin, such as those used to induce meca/mecr <dig> transcription, appeared to slightly decrease sa <dig> transcription after  <dig> min exposure, while larger, inhibitory concentrations caused even more significant alterations in the sa <dig> transcriptional profile, making it similar to that normally seen in stationary phase growth. these results indicate that transcription of sa <dig> may respond in some way to cell wall stress, rather than in direct response to the presence of β-lactams. this observation is based on relatively subtle changes in sa <dig> transcription, especially at low concentrations of cefoxitin such as those required for meca/mecr <dig> induction. since deletion of sa <dig> has been shown to increase β-lactam resistance, reduced sa <dig> transcription in the presence of β-lactams may also provide some protection against β-lactam exposure.

northerns also showed that, as expected, the sa <dig> transcripts were absent from the deletion mutant , and additional experiments demonstrated that wild type sa <dig> transcription patterns were restored by complementation of Δche <dig> with pme <dig> . the effects of sa <dig> deletion on directly up- and down-stream genes were also investigated. northern blots of the neighbouring genes sa <dig>  sa <dig> and sa <dig>  showed that expression of all three genes was very weak compared to that of sa <dig>  a weak transcript of about  <dig> kb was present in hybridizations probed with orfs sa1665-sa <dig>  this band decreased in size in the sa <dig> mutant when probed with sa <dig> and sa <dig>  one of the transcripts hybridising to the sa <dig> probe also decreased in size by ~ <dig>  kb in the sa <dig> mutant, suggesting that sa <dig> was present on several transcripts of different lengths, including a high abundance monocistronic transcript and low abundance polycistronic transcripts . transcript abundance of both the upstream sa1666-sa <dig> operon and the downstream sa1664-specific transcript all appeared to increase slightly in Δche <dig>  the significance of these subtle increases in transcription are unknown, however, polar effects from sa <dig> deletion seem unlikely, based on the facts that all genes were still transcribed, their transcription levels all remained extremely low and the transcriptional terminator of sa <dig> remained intact in the deletion mutant .

expression of mecr <dig> and meca were analysed from rna of uninduced and induced cultures of che <dig> and Δche <dig>  cells were induced at od <dig> nm  <dig>   and  <dig>   with sub-inhibitory concentrations of cefoxitin, to relieve blai-repression of meca. mecr <dig>  although truncated in che <dig>  was still transcribed and had the same expression pattern as meca, as both became derepressed over time and had the highest transcript levels after  <dig> min of induction. in the mutant Δche <dig>  transcripts of both meca and mecr1' were unaffected by sa <dig> deletion, indicating that sa <dig> had no influence on their expression at either od  <dig>   or od  <dig>  . sa <dig> deletion also had no effect on meca transcription or induction in strains zh <dig>  zh <dig> and zh <dig> .

western blot analysis
mutants of che <dig> and of zh <dig> and zh <dig>  which had the largest differences in oxacillin resistance levels, were analysed by western blot analysis to determine if sa <dig> affected production of pbp2a from meca. as shown in figure 5e, all pairs of wild type and mutant strains had similar amounts of pbp2a present both before and after induction with cefoxitin, indicating that sa <dig> deletion did not alter amounts of pbp2a produced. therefore it seems that sa <dig> exerts no direct control over meca or pbp2a expression.

discussion
methicillin resistance in mrsa is primarily dependent on the presence of the meca gene, however, resistance levels are generally governed by strain-specific factors including meca regulatory elements and other chromosomal fem/aux factors which either enhance or repress the expression of resistance. for instance, the very low-level methicillin resistance of the zurich drug clone che <dig>  was shown to be controlled by its genetic background  <cit>  suggesting that it either contained or lacked certain fem/aux factors involved in controlling resistance expression. many of the currently known fem/aux factors are directly or indirectly involved in cell wall synthesis and turnover, or envelope biogenesis, however there still remain factors of unknown function. most of the currently known fem/aux factors reduce methicillin resistance levels when inactivated. a few genes, such as lyth, dlt, norg, sarv and cida increase resistance levels upon inactivation or mutation. all of these genes, except norg, which is an efflux pump regulator, play a role in either autolysis or are important for cell physiology and growth  <cit> . other genes increase β-lactam resistance upon overexpression, such as hmra coding for a putative amidohydrolase, hmrb coding for a putative acyl carrier protein  <cit> , or the norg-controlled abca multidrug efflux pump  <cit> .

sa <dig>  a predicted dna-binding transcriptional regulator, was found to bind to a dna fragment containing the meca promoter region. however, although this protein shifted the meca operator/5' coding sequence, it did not appear to directly control meca or mecr <dig> transcription or pbp2a production. therefore its binding to the meca region may have no specific regulatory function. such interactions have been noted before, such as the hth protein norg, which was shown to bind specifically to nora, norb and norc promoters, but only transcription of norb was increased when norg was overexpressed  <cit> . we have to postulate therefore that sa <dig> may modulate β-lactam resistance in a meca-independent manner, by controlling cellular functions affecting resistance levels. experiments to determine the sa <dig> regulon are ongoing. the impact of deleting sa <dig> in mrsa was extremely strain specific, underlining the importance of the genetic background in governing the final methicillin resistance levels of mrsa, and demonstrating the large genomic variability between different strain lineages.

CONCLUSIONS
sa <dig> is a previously uncharacterised dna-binding protein that has a negative effect on β-lactam resistance in mrsa. the sa <dig> protein was identified in a dna-binding protein purification assay, in which it bound to a dna fragment covering the mec operator region. however, while nonpolar deletion of sa <dig> was shown to increase oxacillin resistance levels in several heterogeneously resistant mrsa, its deletion had no effect on meca transcription or pbp2a production. therefore the negative impact of sa <dig> on methicillin resistance is most likely to be through the regulation of other chromosomal factors or cellular functions required for methicllin resistance.
