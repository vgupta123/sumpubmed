BACKGROUND
soil microorganisms are key determinants of soil fertility and plant health. terrestrial bacteria and fungi have undergone evolution and niche differentiation and interact in different ways with various outcomes in soil ecosystems. the presence of fungi may have diminished available ecological niches for bacteria, but can also result in the creation of new niches  <cit> . greater insight into the mechanisms underlying natural antagonistic interactions between bacteria and fungi and the particular organisms involved has the potential to yield significant knowledge that can be used in the application of microorganisms for the biological control of plant diseases, complementing or replacing traditional chemical treatments.

fungal responses to bacteria have been mainly studied within the context of interactions between ectomycorrhizal fungi with “mycorrhizal helper bacteria”  <cit> . interactions of the ectomycorrhizal fungus amanita muscaria with streptomyces ach  <dig> have been reported to promote fungal growth with changes in fungal metabolism, signalling, cell structure and cell growth response  <cit> . regulation of genes involved in recognition processes, transcription and primary metabolism has been observed during confrontation of laccaria bicolor with pseudomonas fluorescens. some of the molecular determinants were specific to the model organism used in the study, whereas others were also regulated in the same way by other rhizobacteria  <cit> .

most previous biological control studies have focused on the behaviour and mechanisms that beneficial biocontrol organisms utilize against fungal pathogens. bacterial species belonging to the genera bacillus, burkholderia, collimonas and pseudomonas have been studied extensively from a biocontrol perspective  <cit>  and found to use a wide array of mechanisms influencing plant growth and health .

however responses of fungal pathogens to antagonistic bacteria have received much less attention. the simultaneous transcriptional profiling of the mycophagous bacterium collimonas fungivorans and the fungus aspergillus niger during interaction in in-vitro dual-culture assays has been reported  <cit> . complex interactions related to antibiosis, trophism and nutrient competition were observed in both partners. hyphal deformations of aspergillus due to the presence of the bacteria were observed, coinciding with altered expression of genes related to lipid and cell wall degradation, cell defence and nitrogen deficiency.

plant pathogens are also capable of exploiting a wide array of mechanisms in order to counteract and compete against antagonism from both microbial antagonists and other pathogens  <cit> . a more comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the molecular communication between pathogens and biological control agents in the rhizosphere is therefore needed to elucidate these complex interactions. there may be many different genetically regulated responses during the antagonist-pathogen interaction under the influence of different agents of stress on both sides , especially in the zone of interaction. processes related to lipid-, carbon-, cell membrane- and cell wall metabolism, cell defence, self protection against oxidative stress, transcription and pathogenesis are transcriptionally regulated in fungi interacting with antagonistic microorganisms  <cit> . additionally, fungi engaged in competition with antagonistic microorganisms frequently produce secondary metabolites, extracellular phenol-oxidizing enzymes, and differentiated structures in the zone of conflict  <cit> ,

one important pathogen of several agricultural crops, including oilseed rape and potato, is the soil-borne basidiomycete fungus rhizoctonia solani,  that causes damping off and root rot in oilseed rape and black scurf diseases of potato. once established it is difficult to control because of its broad host range, saprophytic life style and persistence of the sclerotia and mycelium in soil and plant material. potato is mostly affected by ag <dig> isolates  <cit> , especially in the potato production areas under cool climates such as northern europe  <cit> . existing control strategies based on chemical treatment and crop cultivation practices have limited efficacy and alternative biocontrol strategies are required to improve sustainability  <cit> .

plant-associated bacteria including those belonging to serratia, have been screened for antagonism against plant pathogenic fungi and have been shown to be beneficial in oilseed rape  <cit> . the genomes of four serratia strains  have been recently sequenced . the genomes of s <dig> and as <dig> have been studied in detail and differences in their type secretion systems, colonization patterns, antibiotic and secondary metabolites production have been demonstrated that are consisten with their diverse plant growth promoting activities and antagonistic interactions with the plant pathogenic fungus r. solani ag2- <dig>  <cit> . in-vitro experiments with bacterial strains as <dig> and s <dig> challenged with r. solani ag2- <dig> revealed greater antagonistic activity of s <dig> compared to the activity of as <dig>  transcriptomic analyses of these two bacterial strains inoculated with the pathogen in in-vitro systems revealed different patterns of gene expression compared to the non-inoculated control treatments  <cit> .

the aim of the present study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which the fungus r. solani responds to challenge with the plant-associated serratia bacteria s <dig> and as <dig>  exhibiting different levels of antagonism. we hypothesized that there would be a greater rearrangement of the fungal transcriptome in response to the stronger antagonist s <dig> than to as <dig>  we also expected that some general changes in metabolism would be involved in fungal stress responses to both bacteria, but that specific responses to individual bacterial strains would also occur. to test this hypothesis an in-vitro confrontation assay was developed and rna sequencing of the pathogenic fungus was performed by exploiting the recently published r. solani rhs1ap ag <dig> genome  <cit> , accession number . at the gene transcript level, the overall fungal response to the bacteria was similar for both s <dig> and as <dig> and large-scale changes in the fungal transcriptome were evident suggesting the simultaneous alteration of primary metabolism, activation of defence and attack mechanisms and shifts in hyphal morphology and growth.

RESULTS
effects of serratia on growth and morphology of r. solani mycelium
when r. solani was challenged with serratia s <dig> and as <dig>  clear inhibition of fungal mycelial growth was evident already at 72 hours in both cases compared to the control treatments without bacteria . this inhibition persisted for at least four weeks . microscopic observations of fungal hyphae during interactions with serratia revealed swollen mycelium, with increased septation and branching and thickened cell walls compared to control straight mycelium with normal branching and septation .fig.  <dig> dual culture in vitro bacterial-fungal assays. a control r. solani monoculture. b

bioinformatic analysis
read trimming and mapping of illumina reads
to examine the molecular response of r. solani to s. proteamaculans s <dig> and s. plymuthica as <dig>  we compared the transcriptome of the fungus at 72 h post inoculation when grown in monoculture with those when grown during interaction with each of the two bacteria. nine libraries were created in total for deep sequencing r. solani ag3-control, r. solani ag3-s <dig>  and r. solani ag3-as <dig>  each in triplicate) and the raw reads  obtained from illumina® truseq were firstly filtered. the number of contaminant-free filtered reads ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> million reads per sample . they were mapped to the rhs1ap reference genome using bowtie <dig> and tophat <dig> . after quality trimming  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads of average length 75-100 bp were obtained and used to align to the reference genome. alignment details are shown in table  <dig>  box plot analysis of fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped  distributions of the nine samples in our study revealed that the transcripts had similar distribution, suggesting that the sets of sequence data are comparable and suitable for our downstream analyses . additionally, principal component analysis  of the log2-transformed fpkm values highlighted the difference between the samples and revealed that presence of both bacterial strains s <dig> and as <dig> affected the fungal transcriptome .table  <dig> summary of read numbers and alignment based on the rna-seq data. c = control, s4 = challenged with serratia proteamaculans, as13 = challenged with serratia plymuthica, r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig> are three biological replicates



effects of serratia s <dig> and as <dig> on gene expression of r. solani
approximately 10 % of the whole fungal transcriptome was differentially expressed with a total of  <dig> and  <dig> genes significantly up- or down- regulated for s <dig> and as <dig> respectively . the numbers of s4- and as13-specific differentially expressed genes  were  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, while there were  <dig> common degs in the two treatment groups additional file 4: table s <dig>  additional file 5: table s <dig>  a total of  <dig> and  <dig> genes respectively had fold values exceeding +/− 8x and this cut-off value was used for all further analyses, unless otherwise specified.

following differential expression analysis, the transcripts with fold values exceeding log <dig>  were subjected to blastx. of those,  <dig> sequences were finally successfully annotated after enhancing the annotation by including the results of an interproscan database search and the annex augmentation procedure  <cit> .

the top  <dig> differentially expressed genes of r. solani during interaction with s <dig> and as <dig> are presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  highly upregulated genes included aliphatic nitrilase, betaine lipid, isocitrate lyase, hydrolases, ricin-like lectins, proteins of cytochrome p <dig>  glutamine amidotransferase, glutathione s-transferase, haloacid dehalogenase and transporters. highly downregulated genes included a glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> protein, a copper-centre containing protein, a tyrosinase tyrosinase central domain protein, proteins of cytochrome p <dig> and pectinesterases and xylanase, genes related to plant cell wall modification and degradation.table  <dig> top  <dig> upregulated genes of rhizoctonia solani when challenged with serratia proteamaculans s <dig> or serratia plymuthica as13



functional classification of degs in r. solani influenced by serratia
enrichment analysis of treatment differences from the reference genome revealed significant over- and under-representation of different gene ontology  terms.

interactions with s4
 for the treatment with s <dig>   <dig> up-regulated go terms were over- and  <dig> were under- represented. the over-represented terms corresponding to the lowest p-values in increasing order included go: <dig> , go: <dig> , go: <dig> , go: <dig>  and the under-represented go: <dig> , go: <dig> , go: <dig> , go: <dig>  . downregulated genes belong to nine enriched over-represented terms representatively including go: <dig> , go: <dig> , go: <dig> , go: <dig>  and  <dig> under-represented terms go: <dig> , go: <dig> . go: <dig>  and go: <dig>  .

interactions with as13
for the r. solani challenged with as <dig>   <dig> upregulated go terms were over- and  <dig> were under-represented. the over-represented terms corresponding to the lowest p-values in increasing order included go: <dig> , go: <dig> , go: <dig> , go: <dig>  and the under-represented go: <dig> , go: <dig> , go: <dig> , go: <dig>  . down-regulated genes belonged to eight enriched over-represented terms including go: <dig> , go: <dig> , go: <dig> , go: <dig>   and one under-represented term go: <dig> .

when comparing the enriched categories between the two treatments with s <dig> and as <dig>  some up-regulated go terms such as threonine-type endopeptidase activity, oxidation-reduction process, pyridine-containing compound biosynthetic process, pyruvate metabolism, proteolysis involved in cellular protein catabolic process and proteasome core complex were over-represented in both cases. terms under-represented in both cases included dna-dependent transcription, purine ribonucleotide metabolic process, nucleoside-triphosphatase activity, ribosome biogenesis, organelle membrane, dna metabolic process, organelle organization, ribosome and dna binding . the down-regulated go terms nucleosome, nucleolus, nucleosome assembly, mrna processing, atp-dependent helicase activity and rna binding were commonly over-represented in both treatments. nucleotide binding and eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig> were over-represented only in the presence of s <dig>  whereas dna-directed rna polymerase activity and cellular components integral to membrane were only over-represented in the presence of as <dig> .

 analyses of over represented cellular locations of genes expressed differentially in response to s <dig> and as <dig> are shown in additional file 10: figures s <dig> and additional file 11: figure s <dig> respectively. in the presence of both s <dig> and as <dig>  overrepresentation of upregulated genes localized integrally to the membrane and in the extracellular region was observed. downregulated genes in the presence of s <dig> were mainly localized in the nucleus, whereas in the presence of as <dig> there were  <dig> genes integral to the membrane,  <dig> in the extracellular region and  <dig> in the nucleus.

effects of serratia s <dig> and as <dig> on kegg pathways in r. solani
kegg pathway annotations of degs ≥ log <dig> were obtained using the kaas annotation server and revealed the presence of enzymes involved in taurine biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, drug metabolism by cytochrome p <dig>  sucrose metabolism, nicotinate metabolism, ascorbate metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, pyruvate and vitamin b <dig> metabolism. even though the overall response of the fungus to both bacterial strains is similar, some kegg pathways were present in only one of the treatments. figure 3a and b display the number of metabolism-related genes for specific kegg pathways that were found to be up- and down- regulated respectively in both treatments. when challenging r. solani with s <dig>  there was greater restructuring of the fungal transcriptome than with as <dig>  genes related to pyruvate, propanoate, methane, gluoxylate and glycerophospholipid metabolism, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p <dig>  glucolysis, fatty acid and charoalcane degradation were prominent in the s <dig> treatment. additionally there were  <dig> unique kegg pathways obtained from annotations of genes being up-regulated only in challenge with s <dig>  and  <dig> unique ones found when as <dig> was present . twelve and  <dig> kegg metabolic pathways were found to be uniquely downregulated in presence of s <dig> and as <dig> respectively .fig.  <dig> kegg pathway annotations found to be common between the treatments with s <dig> serratia proteamaculans and as <dig> serratia plymuthica for metabolism-related differentially expressed genes with fold values exceeding log <dig>   up-regulated genes,  down-regulated genes

apart from metabolism-related annotations, the kaas server also provides annotations related to genetic and environmental information processing and cellular processes. genes encoding for enzymes of the lysosomes, two component system and mitogen-activated protein kinases  were found to be upregulated in the presence of both antagonistic bacteria. genes involved in translation, transcription and repair and replication were commonly downregulated. genes encoding for enzymes of peroxisomes, cgmp-pkg signalling, nucleotide excision repair and actin cytoskeleton regulation were found to be uniquely upregulated in the presence of s <dig>  on the contrary, genes related to ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, mrna surveillance, rna transport, dna replication and mismatch repair were downregulated only during confrontation with s <dig> 

quantitative real-time pcr validation
to validate the rna-seq data, we used quantitative real-time pcr  to examine the pattern of gene expression of eight highly up- or down- regulated degs. these genes encoded aliphatic nitrilase, endobeta xylanase, dienelactone hydrolase, isocitrate lyase, glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  haloacid dehalogenase, short chain dehydrogenase and copper radical oxidase. the trend of up- or down- regulation observed in the rna-seq experiment was validated for all the genes and statistically significant differences were observed between control and both treatments for three genes. for the remaining five genes, statistically significant differences were observed between control and the treatment with s <dig> .fig.  <dig> expression profiles of selected r. solani genes during interaction with s <dig> serratia proteamaculans and as <dig> serratia plymuthica. relative expression levels in relation to histone h <dig> expression are calculated from ct values according to the  <dig> –ΔΔct method. error bars represent standard deviations based on  <dig> biological replicates. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared with expression in the absence of bacteria  according to fisher’s test 



discussion
 the results presented in this study support our hypothesis, that when r. solani is confronted with s. proteamaculans s <dig> and s. plymuthica as <dig>  it regulates expression of genes associated with general stress responses common to both bacteria, that involve both primary and secondary metabolism. we interpret the genes in the main gene ontology categories oxidation-reduction, pathogenesis, threonine-type endopeptidase activity and cellular proteolysis as being involved in the following processes: a) arrested growth of the fungus and changes in hyphal morphology, b) defence against bacterial stress through the production of antioxidants, xenobiotic degradation and environmental alterations and c) attack involving toxin production and oxidative stress. although no significant general differences between the fungal responses to the two species of bacteria were found, differences in specific kegg metabolic pathways and individual genes were evident between the two bacterial treatments.

a) changes in growth and hyphal morphology
arrested growth of the fungal hyphae was evident at an early stage in our in-vitro systems indicating that cell division and regulation of genetic information processing was under repression. indeed, genes related to transcription, translation, dna repair and replication were downregulated in the presence of s <dig> and as <dig>  changes in hyphal growth and morphology of the pathogen in response to the bacteria are indicative of stress responses by the fungus. these appeared to involve genes related to the regulation of cell walls and cell membrane functions. the use of the biological control bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens dr <dig> induced similar morphological changes in r. solani hyphae  <cit> .

the fungal cell wall is a dynamic structure responsible for protection of the cell from changes in osmotic and environmental stresses and is the first barrier that needs to be overcome to achieve invasion of host cells. fungal cell walls are primarily composed of chitin, glucans, mannans and glycoproteins  <cit> . consequently, differential expression of cell-wall modification genes is expected when fungi are exposed to stress-related conditions. in our study, a chitinase gene, a member of the glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> protein involved in chitin catabolism, as well as genes encoding for chitin deacetylase and glucanase, were found to be repressed in the presence of both of the bacteria. this is consistent with our microscopic observation of thickened fungal cell walls when r. solani was challenged with the bacteria.

 depletion of ergosterol in fungal membrane disrupts the structure and many functions, leading to inhibition of fungal growth  <cit> . additionally, regulation of membrane permeability is one of the principal mechanisms for conferring protection against oxidative stress  <cit> . in our study, the ergosterol biosynthesis genes erg <dig> to erg <dig> were all significantly downregulated during interaction with s <dig>  with fold values ranging between − <dig> to − <dig>  in contrast, up-regulation of ergosterol related genes has been reported for the filamentous fungus aspergillus niger when confronted with the mycophagous bacterium collimonas fungivorans, probably as a mechanism for regulating membrane fluidity  <cit> , or as conferring resistance to antifungal compounds such as amphotericin b  <cit> .

 abc transporters and other efflux pumps are exploited for active export of toxins out of the cell in order to reduce toxin concentration at the target sites and prevention of accumulation of harmful secondary metabolites produced during pathogenesis  <cit> . this has been reported for the pathogen botrytis cinerea in presence of the antimicrobial compounds  <dig> -dapg and pyrrolnitrin produced by biological control bacteria of the genus pseudomonas  <cit> . in a previous study of fungal interactions with serratia sp. transcipts for production of pyrrolnitrin were upregulated in s. plymuthica as <dig> but not in s. proteamaculans s <dig>  <cit> . interestingly in the present study one gene encoding an abc transporter was upregulated only in the presence of as <dig> suggesting its role in protection from bacterial metabolites.

plant cell-wall degrading enzymes can be downregulated in the presence of antagonistic bacteria suggesting that pectin, cellulose and glucose might have become depleted in the growth medium. in the presence of s <dig> one gene encoding polysaccharide monooxygenase was downregulated. one gene related to pectinesterase activity was also found to be downregulated in the presence of s <dig> and two genes encoding glucan  <dig> -beta-glucosidases as well in presence of both s <dig> and as <dig>  two cellulase genes, members of the glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  were downregulated in both the s <dig> and as <dig> treatments. these observations suggest that bacterial antagonists may induce nutrient stress in the plant pathogen.

organisms under stress conditions have been shown to increase fatty-acid degradation, upregulate genes involved in the glyoxylate cycle and store glycogen and trehalose  <cit> . in our study four genes related to fatty acid degradation, four genes related to pyruvate metabolism and one gene related to fatty acid metabolism were significantly upregulated in both of the serratia treatments, suggesting that under stress these compounds could potentially be used as carbon sources through gluconeogenesis. acetate-ligase is a key enzyme related to pyruvate metabolism and gluconeogenesis and was induced in the presence of serratia.

the key enzymes of the glyoxylate pathway  were highly expressed in the presence of both serratia bacteria. in this pathway, the enzyme isocitrate lyase cleaves isocitrate into succinate and glyoxylate and subsequently glyoxylate is converted to malate by the enzyme malate synthase  <cit> . a deletion strain of the isocitrate lyase gene in trichoderma atroviride showed reduced antagonistic ability against botrytis cinerea and induction of systemic resistance in arabidopsis thaliana, demonstrating the importance of the glyoxylate cycle in growth, stress tolerance and antagonism  <cit> .

glycogen and trehalose are two glucose compounds that have been demonstrated to be used by fungi, playing crucial roles in metabolic adaptation including stress protection and energy storage and putatively in progression of cell division  <cit> . enzymes for the metabolic synthesis of both compounds were upregulated in the presence of as <dig>  whereas presence of s <dig> led to the induction of trehalose biosynthesis, that has been associated with stress tolerance  <cit> .

genes involved in nitrogen metabolism  were upregulated only in the treatment with s <dig>  increased expression levels of nitrogen metabolism genes were found in s <dig> bacteria only, but not in as <dig>  <cit> .

protein kinases have roles in all aspects of regulation and signal transduction and are responsible for protein phosphorylation. protein kinases such as serine/theorine, mapks, adenylsulfate, ribosylnicotinamide were up-regulated in both bacterial treatments. two-component regulatory systems serve as a basic stimulus response coupling mechanism, allowing organisms to sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions  <cit>  and enzymes involved in this signal transduction system were induced .

b) defence
plant pathogenic fungi have evolved a wide array of mechanisms to defend themselves during stress and competition, either in an attempt to ameliorate the effects of toxic compounds, or to outcompete other microorganisms in terms of scavenging nutrients, occupying ecological niches and altering the environment  <cit> . our data indicate that r. solani can defend itself against oxidative stress caused during confrontation with serratia s <dig> and as <dig> through two mechanisms: 1) antioxidant production and degradation of xenobiotics and 2) environmental alteration.antioxidant production and xenobiotic degradation



a common defence mechanism of all living organisms is related to the production of antioxidants that remove free radical intermediates and inhibit other active oxidants and it is likely that r. solani also attempts to increase resistance to oxidative stress caused by both bacteria. almost  <dig>  transcripts related to oxidoreductase activity were upregulated in both treatments and in terms of defence such genes could be used for xenobiotic degradation and serve as antioxidants. one such example is glutathione metabolism where six and three genes encoding for glutathione-s-transferase  proteins were upregulated between  <dig> and  <dig> times in the presence of s <dig> and as <dig> respectively.

transaminases and pyridoxal-5-phosphatases are enzymes implicated in the biosynthesis of vitamin b <dig> and the genes encoding the production of these enzymes were upregulated 2– <dig> times in response to interaction with s <dig>  pyridoxal reductase is essential for the biosynthesis of vitamin b <dig>  which has been shown to act as an antioxidant and alleviator of reactive-oxygen-species  in stressed fungi  <cit> . it has been shown that when r. solani is confronted with the mycoparasite stachybotrys elegans, pyridoxal reductase expression is induced, probably as a defence response  <cit> .

epoxide hydrolases were initially reported as enzymes involved in detoxification of different epoxides, including  <dig> -butadiene oxide, styrene oxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benzopyrene- <dig> -oxide  <cit> . the genome of s. plymuthica as <dig> contains genes for acetoin reductase involved in conversion of acetoin to  <dig> -butanediol, as well as  <dig> -butanediol reductase involved in catabolism of  <dig>  butanediol  <cit> . the molecule  <dig> -butanediol can be dehydrated to  <dig> -butadiene  <cit> . during confrontation of r. solani with s <dig> and as <dig>  two and one genes respectively, encoding for microsomal epoxide hydrolase  were highly induced between  <dig> and  <dig> times.

 nitrilases catalyze the hydrolysis of nitrile compounds to carboxylic acid and ammonia. in plant-microbe interactions, they are implicated in hormone synthesis, nitrogen utilization, catabolism of cyanogenic glycosides and glucosinolates and detoxification of nitriles and cyanide  <cit> . bacterial nitriles can be formed during detoxification of endogenous and exogenous cyanide produced during cyanogenesis  <cit>  and serratia as <dig> can produce hcn. in addition, the genomes of both serratia s <dig> and as <dig> contain genes that catalyse reactions involved in indole-3-acetic acid  biosynthesis  <cit>  and nitrilases have been implicated in the conversion of iaa precursors to iaa  <cit> . in the presence of both bacteria, the enzyme aliphatic nitrilase was highly upregulated between  <dig> and  <dig> times. similar patterns of highly upregulated expression of nitrilase genes have been reported for aspergillus niger during confrontation with the bacterium collimonas  <cit> .

halogenated compounds can be synthesized in nature by a wide range of microorganisms, some of which have antimicrobial properties  <cit> . it is known that fungi can degrade antibiotics produced by competing microorganisms and  <dig> times upregulation of the gene encoding for haloacid dehalogenase could be implicated in the degradation of the antibiotic pyrrolnitrin produced by serratia s <dig> and as <dig>  <cit> .

fungal laccases have multiple roles, including morphogenesis, degradation of lignin, stress defence and plant/pathogen interaction  <cit> . in our study, four genes encoding for laccase multicopper benzenediol:oxygen oxidorectuctase were upregulated in response to both bacteria from  <dig>  to  <dig> times. in another study, different strains of the biological control bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens induced elevated laccase production in r. solani interpreted as triggering of calcium and heat/shock signalling pathways in response to bacterial antifungal metabolites  <cit> .2) environmental alterations



some species of fungi are capable of gaining a competitive advantage over other microorganisms by acidifying their environment. increased production of oxalate by r. solani in response to p. fluorescens  <cit>  and by aspergillus niger in response to the bacterium collimonas  <cit>  has been shown. when r. solani was challenged with serratia s <dig>   <dig> genes encoding oxalate decarboxylase were overexpressed 6– <dig> times. the underlying reasons for this change in our experiment are not clear but fungal oxalate decarboxylases are considered to play a major role in the prevention of high intracellular levels of oxalic acid as well as to the decomposition of extracellular oxalic acid  <cit> .

c) attack
toxin production was induced in both treatments, volvatoxin a <dig> precursor in treatment with s <dig> and partial delta-endotoxin in treatment with as <dig>  both toxins are members of the endotoxin cytb protein family, having insecticidal properties and produced by the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis  <cit> . it has been reported that similar proteins can be found in other pathogenic fungi and bacteria suggesting a potential role of these proteins in the virulence of these microorganisms  <cit> . interestingly, it has been recently shown that when r. solani ag <dig> was co-cultured with the soil-inhabiting bacterial antagonist bacillus subtilis and with the mycoparasite stachybotrys elegans, rsendo <dig> gene encoding a delta-endotoxin cytb gene was downregulated in contrast to the upregulation shown in our study  <cit> . a gene containing the ricin b-like lectin domain involved in the production of the highly toxic legume lectin ricin was also highly upregulated almost  <dig> times in both treatments.

the survival, response and adaptation of cells to environmental changes is strongly dependent on processes involving proteolysis  <cit>  and proteolytic enzymes of numerous phytopathogenic fungi are potential pathogenicity factors. in this respect it is interesting that genes encoding for proteases were induced in both of the treatments. in the s <dig> treatment, six such genes encoding the metalloprotease deuterolysin were upregulated and could possibly be a defence reaction of the fungus. the metalloprotease serralysin was also found upregulated in s <dig> and as <dig> serratia bacteria interacting with r. solani in an earlier study  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
rna sequencing technology allowed the identification of a large number of genes in the phytopathogenic fungus r. solani required for survival and defence in the presence of plant-associated bacteria s. plymuthica  and s. proteamaculans . a major shift in gene expression was observed with a simultaneous alteration of primary metabolic processes, activation of defence and attack mechanisms and changes in hyphal morphology. most genes were regulated in a similar way in the presence of both bacterial strains, but there were also some strain-specific responses. most of these were related to the presence of s. proteamaculans s <dig>  a finding that is consistent with its apparently higher degree of antagonism against r. solani.

 obviously, the controlled environment used in the above study lacks the complexity of real-life soil and rhizosphere habitats, but nevertheless the results provide an insight into the functional basis of the responses of a fungal pathogen to two closely related antagonistic bacteria. the differentially expressed genes identified with our in-vitro experimental approach provide a context within which to perform further analyses of a) this fungal isolate to other species and strains of bacteria, b) other members of the rhizoctonia species complex to serratia bacteria, and c) r. solani ag <dig> gene expression in more natural soil systems. the long term aim of these studies is to provide a more detailed understanding of the in-situ competitive interactions between bacteria and fungi, that in turn will permit successful application of biological control strategies within sustainable agriculture.
