BACKGROUND
sequencing and annotation of the different genomes done in the last couple of decades has clearly shown that even the relatively compact eukaryotic genomes have large amounts of non-coding dna. this dna harbors elements that control genomic activity such as gene regulators, non-coding rnas and less well characterized elements that position the chromosomes on the nuclear matrix. the nuclear matrix forms a three dimensional protein network onto which chromatin fibers are attached. interaction between chromatin and the nuclear matrix is believed to occur at specific sites from  <dig> base pairs  to several kilobases  long, termed scaffold/matrix attachment regions   <cit> .

experimentally, smars have been defined as either dna fragments that remain bound to the nuclear matrix after chromatin proteins and other dna are removed, or dna that binds to extracted nuclear matrix in the presence of competitor dna  <cit> . identification of s/mars is a necessary step for successful functional mapping of nucleotide sequences, since these sites can bring genes into association with the nuclear matrix and significantly change transcription level, thus marking transcriptionally active regions  <cit> . s/mar elements play a major role in genome organization and gene regulation. they have been reported to alter the expression levels of some genes depending on their position relative to the matrix  <cit> . s/mars have also been associated with enhanced transcription, particularly in transgene constructs where flanking transgenes with s/mars have resulted in higher and more stable expression  <cit> . they have been associated as a boundary between functional chromatin domains  <cit> . it is also reported that the effects of long-range enhancers may be restricted by the positioning of s/mar elements  <cit> . from the genome organization perspective, s/mars have been implicated in the positioning of chromosomal territories  <cit> .

computational methods are thought to be prerequisite for the analysis of whole genomes for predicting s/mars and though several tools like marwiz  <cit> , marscan  <cit> , chrclass  <cit> , smartest  <cit>  and sidd  <cit>  have been developed for this purpose, prediction of s/mar is not conclusive unless it has been supported by experimental proof. the most common experimental method for identifying s/mar uses re-association assays to define dna fragments that bind to the nuclear matrix  <cit> . south-western assays  <cit>  and pcr based assays  <cit>  have also been used successfully to show s/mar binding to nuclear matrix.

though s/mars have been well studied in yeasts, plants, mammalian systems and drosophila, there has been very few reports of these elements from the protists. so far genome wide search for s/mars have been carried out in silico for arabidopsis thaliana and c. elegans using smartest and mrs finder respectively  <cit> . this study had revealed that genes containing predicted s/mars had low transcription levels  <cit> . in c.elegans, s/mars were found to be the flanking coding regions  <cit> . marfinder and marscan have been used previously to identify functional s/mar elements in entamoeba  <cit> .

the genome of giardia lamblia, the protozoan parasite responsible for causing giardiasis worldwide among people with poor fecal-oral hygiene, has been sequenced recently  <cit> . the  <dig>  mb genome of this deep branching eukaryote, distributed over  <dig> chromosomes showed an exceedingly simple genome structure comprising of only  <dig> origin recognition complex proteins and total absence of regulatory initiation proteins  <cit> . moreover, giardia contained only  <dig> of the  <dig> transcription initiation factors present in saccharomyces  <cit> . as the genome of this organism has been studied, very few regulatory elements were seen to be present in this parasite. promoters had been identified and characterized earlier  <cit>  but other regulatory elements like insulators, boundary elements enhancers and locus control regions were not revealed in the genome sequencing project.

in this work, we have used all the available bioinformatics tools for predicting s/mars from the genome of giardia lamblia and used pcr based, as well as south-western assays to actually see how many of the predicted s/mars were able to bind to nuclear matrix. this is the first ever report of s/mar like dna elements from this gastrointestinal pathogen. in this paper we have also reflected on how any single computational tools for prediction of s/mar can be very inaccurate on the protozoan parasite genome, but a combination of different tools along with laboratory based assays, give us a comprehensive idea about s/mar distribution in giardia lamblia genome. our studies show  <dig> s/mar sequences from giardia lamblia which are associated with its nuclear matrix proteins are can thus be regarded as s/mar elements.

RESULTS
in silico prediction of putative s/mars from giardia genome using existing tools
we used the available tools for identifying putative s/mars from giardia genome. currently, four such tools are available: marfinder  <cit> , marscan  <cit> , chrclass  <cit>  and smartest  <cit> . some groups have also used sidd  for predicting s/mar regions  <cit> . however, as sidd calculations do not  form the basis of an s/mar predictor for wild type s/mars in genomic dna as reflected by evans et al  <cit> , we have not used it in our study. the results obtained from these tools are summarized in table  <dig> 

*threshold =  <dig>  window size = 300

smartest, which predominantly analyses s/mar based on the at richness of the genome gave only  <dig> hits in the giardia genome. the average percentage of at for the predicted s/mar regions using smartest is equal to  <dig> %. marscan, which predicts s/mar regions based on the presence of a bipartite signature, identifies  <dig> s/mars from the genome and predicted the average distance between two consecutive s/mars to be ~ <dig> kb. marfinder, which is by far the most widely used tool for identifying s/mars in mammalian and plant genome predicts  <dig> putative s/mars in the giardia genome predicting an average distance of ~ <dig> kb between two consecutive s/mars and chrclass, the tool based on comparative analysis of various context characteristics associated with s/mars identifies  <dig> s/mars from the giardia genome. a comparison of the results from the different tools in determining the length of s/mars in the putative s/mar regions and the distance between s/mars is demonstrated in figure 1a figure 1b and table  <dig> 

we used marfinder to understand a complete picture of the s/mar distribution in the giardia genome . as this method looked into a varied number of features associated with s/mars . we trained the software on the negative dataset reported in evans et al  <cit>  prior to running it on giardia genome. it was seen that the threshold value for a "mar potential" had to be modified from the default values to  <dig> in order to get a better noise to signal ratio. using these parameters on the giardia genome, marfinder predicted  <dig> putative s/mars. evans et al  <cit>  has reviewed the existing s/mar prediction tools and has concluded that no single tool is efficient enough to correctly predict s/mars even in higher eukaryotes. we thus assumed that in protozoans with a much more "unstructured" and random genome organizations, it would be more prudent to use a combination of tools for the initial prediction of s/mars. we therefore compared the results from the four different s/mar predicting programs and selected the s/mar regions which were predicted by at least two programs one of which was marfinder . total of  <dig> such s/mar regions were identified. the distribution of s/mars as predicted by the  <dig> tools is shown in the venn diagram in figure 1d. primers were designed for all of these  <dig> putative s/mars  for further analysis.

organization of predicted s/mars in giardia
of all the s/mars predicted from the giardia genome, our analysis shows that about 30% of the s/mars are present in the upstream or downstream of orfs and thus in the intergenic region. 10% s/mars overlapped with orfs either in the 5' or 3' region of the gene. also, about 10% of s/mars contained orfs within themselves and 3% s/mars were present within the orfs. this distribution of s/mars with respect to orfs is shown in figure 2a.

of the  <dig> putative s/mars, some were found to have some interesting organization. glsmar <dig>  was found to have orf of a reverse transcriptase endonuclease apart from a vsp and high cysteine protein within  <dig> kb of it. similar organization i.e presence of several reverse transcriptase endonuclease was also noticed in glsmar <dig>  these orfs are reported to be present in the telomeric region of the chromosome in giardia  <cit> . the significance of the presence of these elements in close proximity of such orfs is beyond the scope of current study. the  <dig> putative s/mars were then tested experimentally for their ability to bind to nuclear matrix. the results are summarized in table  <dig> 

giardia s/mar like elements are present in the nuclear matrix
to determine if giardia s/mars predicted by the bioinformatics search were indeed present in the nuclear matrix, we performed a pcr based test  <cit> . the extracted dna from the nuclear matrix as well as the supernatant released after ecori digestion  were used for polymerase chain amplification with the primers . it was seen that glsmar <dig>  glsmar <dig>  glsmar <dig>  glsmar <dig>  glsmar <dig>  glsmar26- <dig>  glsmar26- <dig>  glsmar <dig>  glsmar <dig> and glsmar <dig> amplified at the expected size , whereas, no amplicon was seen from the supernatant fraction. as positive control, these fragments were also amplified from giardia genomic dna . a non s/mar dna sequence was used as a negative control . this fragment was seen to be amplified from the loop fraction  and not present in the attached fraction. . thus, at least  <dig> of the  <dig> giardia s/mar sequences predicted by the different computational tools were associated with giardia nuclear matrix . glsmar <dig> and glsmar <dig> did not amplify from this dna pool as they had ecori sites internal to the primer binding sites. it was observed that glsmar  <dig> also had ecori sites in the sequence. however, glsmar <dig> had its mar potential peaks coinciding with this positions. it is therefore possible that the ecori sites in glsmar <dig> are protected from digestion as this region is actively involved in binding to the proteins in the nuclear matrix. however, this can only be confirmed by further experimentation. it may be noted that though the length of s/mars in other eukaryotes range from 300- <dig> bp, the giardia s/mars were found to be longer. fragments of  <dig> - <dig>  kb range were amplified from the matrix associated dna pool. the exact length of dna which is essential for the binding remains to be determined by further experimentation.

giardia s/mars bind to nuclear matrix proteins
next, we tested the nuclear matrix associated putative s/mar sequences for their nuclear matrix binding by chemiluminiscence. common s/mars predicted by the bioinformatic tools were developed as probes. these s/mars were tested for their ability to bind to nuclear matrix isolated from the organism. nuclear matrix was isolated according to the protocol of kauffmann et al,  <dig> <cit> . in this method, isolated nuclei were first treated with dnase to digest the dna that was not associated with any proteins. the resulting pellet was then extracted with  <dig>  m nacl to release the histones and other high salt soluble proteins. this was followed up with a detergent wash. the residual pellet, inextractible by detergent or high salt was the nuclear matrix that was used for the different experiments. binding to the nuclear matrix fraction was done by south western blotting  <cit> . it was seen that  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted s/mars were able to bind to nuclear matrix proteins . all these  <dig> s/mars were also seen to be associated with the nuclear matrix in the pcr based assay.  <dig> of the s/mars which were seen to be associated with the nuclear matrix in the pcr based assay did not show binding to nuclear matrix in the south western assay . this was probably because the dna binding motifs in the nuclear matrix were not exposed to the probes in these cases. alternately, glsmar <dig> and glsmar <dig> showed binding to the nuclear matrix by southwestern though it was not amplified from the matrix dependent pool in the pcr based assay. this was because this s/mars had eco ri sites internal to the primers that were used for amplifying the s/mars from the matrix dependent fraction. glsmar <dig> did not amplify in the pcr based assay, but it showed binding to the nuclear matrix proteins in the south western assay. we checked the sequence for the presence of ecori sites but could not find any. it is possible that the template for the glsmar <dig> was too low in the matrix dependent dna pool to be amplified by the glsmar <dig> primers. when the probe was prepared for the south western assay, it was thus able to bind to the protein in the nuclear matrix. all s/mars recognized proteins in the giardia nuclear matrix fraction ranging a molecular weight of  <dig> kd- <dig> kd .

mass spectrometry of giardia nuclear matrix protein
to verify whether any of the proteins recognized by the s/mars from giardia were indeed resident nuclear matrix proteins, we excised one band  from the coomassie stained gel which also bound to glsmar <dig>  and went for mass spectrometric identification.

the obtained peaklist  was analysed using the web based analysis software mascot against the ncbinr database as g.lamblia genomic database is not present in mascot. the top score was that of a homologue of a tat-binding protein from plasmodium chabaudi. the peptides identified in the peaklist by mascot are shown in figure 5b. when searched against the giardia database with the p. chabaudi protein sequence, as well as the individual peptides from the ms data, a  <dig> s protease regulatory subunit  <dig> in g.lamblia showed 63% identity with 79% homology  . this protein complex is a known resident nuclear matrix protein in higher eukaryotes  <cit>  and in g.lamblia, this subunit contains an aaa domain of atpase associated with diverse cellular activities. this class of proteins belongs to the superfamily of ring shaped p-loop atpase . these proteins exert their activity through energy dependent unfolding of macromolecules and are also reported to be involved in regulation of gene expression  <cit> .

discussion
giardia lamblia, is a diplomonad, with  <dig> nuclei and is often referred to as a "deep branching eukaryote" as it diverged out of the main evolutionary tree long before the other eukaryotes. as a result, this oraganism has a number of unique features which have become more "organized" in the higher eukaryotes. one of the most unique features of giardia is its lack of organellar structures as for example a well defined mitochondria, golgi bodies and endoplasmic reticulum, in spite of being an eukaryote. traces of marker proteins from these organelles and an amazingly developed membrane structure adept to carry out these functions are however present here enabling this organism to be classified as a eukaryote  <cit> .

though the initials reports of nuclear matrix go as far back as 1960's, the research on s/mars as potential regulatory elements come from the works of j. bode in  <dig>  <cit> . since then, throughout the eukaryotic world, the s/mars have been found to play a significant role in the organization of chromatin, and gene regulation. studies on the recently sequenced giardia genome have shown the genome to be unique in its own way. the protist has  <dig> chromosomes, and almost  <dig> orfs packed into a small genome of  <dig> mb length. it has been seen that the parasite has no homolog for h <dig> which is the universal linker for compacting chromatin in the nuclei  <cit> . in this scenario, the study of scaffold/matrix attachment region in this parasite can shed adequate light on the chromatin organization in this organism. we did a preliminary screen on the g.lamblia genome with available s/mar prediction tools. when the common regions predicted by at least  <dig> tools were taken into consideration, we were able to shortlist at least  <dig> putative s/mar regions. to prove this dna fragments were indeed nuclear matrix dependent fragments we did the pcr based assay, which showed that  <dig> out of  <dig> putative s/mars where actually associated with the nuclear matrix of giardia. this showed that the false positive rate of our strategy was about 33%. assuming that the distance between the s/mars in this genome can range from 50- <dig> kb, as seen in table  <dig>  we expect about  <dig> s/mars in the entire genome of giardia. the combination of computational tools correctly predicted only 10% of the total number of the expected s/mars. this indicates that the s/mar prediction tools that can be used with accuracy on the higher eukaryotic genome, in most of the instances are not very accurate in predicting lower eukaryotic s/mars. experimental methods are an absolute necessity in correctly identifying these elements from the lower eukaryotic genomes. the computational tools for s/mar predictions can only be used as an initial screen for scanning the genome of the protists for presence or absence of s/mars, but the actual confirmation is achieved only by experimental methods. of the  <dig> s/mars,  <dig> also showed positive nuclear matrix binding property in south western blots. among these,  <dig> s/mars which showed positive binding both in pcr as well as south western assay were indeed true s/mars. it now remains to test these giardia s/mars for chromosomal organization studies.

one of the major properties of s/mars is chromosome organization, anchoring and maintenance of higher order structure  <cit> . this is achieved by the proteins in the nuclear matrix which bind to the s/mars thereby allowing it to carry out these functions. the proteins in the nuclear matrix are involved in a host of different functions, including dna replication and repair  <cit> . of these the s/mar binding proteins are  are of utmost importance as they regulate transcription, replication, repair and regulation of gene expression  <cit> . one of the glsmars, glsmar <dig> bound to a proteasome subunit  <dig> as shown by our mass spectrometry results. the  <dig> s proteasome is an eukaryotic atp-dependent protease complex of  <dig> kd which is reported to be present in the nuclear matrix in mouse myoblasts  <cit> . as seen in figure  <dig>  the conserved domain in the  <dig> s proteasome subunit  <dig> in giardia was a aaa domain belonging to the atpase binding protein superfamily. these proteins perform a diverse range of functions in the cell starting vesicle fusion, peroxidase biogenesis  <cit>  to dna repair  <cit> . thus it is not unlikely that this protein would be associated with s/mars and have dna binding properties. there have been reports on the proteasome  <dig> s of giardia lamblia  <cit> , where emmerlich et al showed the  <dig> subunits making up this proteasome structure. though the annotated genome of giardia shows the presence of several of the proteasome  <dig> s subunits, no detailed analysis has been done on these proteins in giardia. a detailed phylogenetic analysis of another aaa atpase domain containing protein midasin has been studied by gallego et al.  <cit> . this protein is conserved thoughout eukaryotes and plays the role of a nuclear chaperone in most organisms. one of the proteins found to be associated with s/mars from yeast to humans, is the saf box domain containing protein. as reported by kipp et al in  <dig>  <cit> , saf-a binds to s/mars through a novel conserved protein domain. a search in http://www.eupathdb.org for proteins having the saf box or the sap domain showed that  <dig> such proteins were present in the different protozoan genomes . thus it is likely that these genomes will also have s/mar like elements in their genome. however, when searched in the giardia genome, this saf/sap domain containing protein was not present. our experimental results discussed in this work indicate that giardia has s/mar binding protein  which does not have a saf/sap domain, but has nucleotide binding domains. while it is possible that in a recently sequenced genome, this protein was not annotated, it is also possible that giardia placed much earlier in the evolutionary scale probably has not yet defined a machinery where these highly conserved domain containing proteins may be present. the presence of s/mars in giardia and the absence of saf box proteins in this organism may also indicate that the early divergence of giardia during evolution probably .resulted in "missing out" this very conserved protein involved in nuclear architecture.

s/mars have been found to be associated with not only chromatin anchoring but also with other regions of the genome as introns  <cit>  and can play a significant role in the regulation of gene expression  <cit> . studies on s/mar in arabidopsis and maize  <cit>  have shown that the plant genome is not packaged by random gathering into domains of indiscriminate length, but rather, the genome is gathered into specific domains, and a gene consistently occupies a discrete physical section of the genome. the average loop size in arabidopsis and maize has been estimated as  <dig> and  <dig> kb, respectively  <cit> , though other studies  <cit>  have suggested smaller domain sizes. some loops may remain permanently condensed and inactive, even within the euchromatic portions of the genome, whereas others can be extended to produce a transcriptionally poised conformation in appropriately differentiated cells  <cit> . our analysis for a genome-wide distribution of s/mars using different tools indicates that the loop size ranges from 50- <dig> kbp in giardia . data on the location of transcribed elements within structural loops at the supragenic level suggest that attachment to the matrix and transcription is not systematically associated  <cit> , though s/mars are associated with the ends of some dnasei-sensitive  domains  <cit> . s/mars have also been identified within introns of genes  <cit> . cockerill et al.  <cit>  suggested that s/mars flanking enhancer sequences may act as positive and/or negative regulators of enhancer function. it is presumed that additional specific s/mars have been further demonstrated in a variety of functional tests to act as insulators  <cit> , according to the loop domain model, by protecting a loop from the effects of the neighboring chromatin or associated enhancer sequences. distribution of giardia s/mars among the transcription factors also hints at this possibility . a much more in-depth study of the s/mars in lower eukaryotes is required to understand the chromatin dynamics and packing in these organisms.

an observation was made in the study by linnemann et al in  <dig> <cit> , where it was seen that the s/mars when present in the 5' region of a gene resulted in a transcript presence, where as those present within the orf associated with silenced genes. a number of s/mars in giardia were also found within the orfs. the significance of this is not clear. in entamoeba, such s/mars were found to have reduced binding ability to nuclear matrix compared to the ones that were present outside orf . it is possible that in these early eukaryotes, the genome organization machinery is also in early stages of evolution and the s/mars within the orfs are actually the ones which in course of evolution would lose their ability to bind to the nuclear matrix completely.

CONCLUSIONS
though analysis of s/mar on large genomic sequences are being done  <cit> , s/mar regions of protists have never really come to the limelight. study on the s/mars in these organisms is of significance in the understanding their gene organization and regulation. the multiple roles played by these s/mars starting from chromosome organization to promoter control, acting as domain barriers, make them important regulatory elements which have not received much focus yet. most of the prediction tools are designed with the structurally organized higher eukaryotic genome in mind. a comparison of these tools reveal that no single tool is accurate enough to predict the s/mars even from an organism with a well defined genome structure  <cit> . in case of lower eukaryotes, these tools do identify the s/mars, but with much less accuracy. our study clearly indicated that even if we take into consideration all the available tools for predicting s/mars from protozoan parasites, they have to be verified experimentally for their ability to be associated with the nuclear matrix. studies like this, also indicate the need to modify and develop more dedicated tools for the prediction of these elements from such divergent genomes, which in turn would help to study gene organization and gene regulation in a much wider scale in these protozoans.
