BACKGROUND
clostridium perfringens is a gram-positive anaerobic species able to form heat-resistant endospores and to live in many habitats, from marine sediments to animal gut, to soil. the genus clostridium comprises species causing severe diseases such as botulism, tetanus, gas gangrene and pseudomembranosus colitis that are generally due to the secretion of powerful toxins. c. perfringens is the most prolific toxin producer within the genus; several of its extracellular toxins and enzymes have been identified as for instance α-toxin , β-toxin , ϵ-toxin, θ-toxin , κ-toxin  and others. toxins are thought to act synergistically in the development of pathogenesis, and c. perfringens strains show a high degree of phenotypic and pathogenic variability, so that understanding the control of the expression of toxin genes is critical to help in fighting diseases caused by this bacterium. the identification of similarities and differences in the set of pathogenic instruments  of different strains will help to define effective strategies of infection control.

pathogens usually have precise control mechanisms for toxin production so that expression only takes place when required e.g. when the density of the bacterial population overcomes a certain threshold, or when the bacterium reaches a certain cell-type/organ.

in bacteria, quorum sensing and environmental signal detection and transduction depend on the activity of dedicated two component systems consisting of a membrane bound sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator. the kinase activity of the sensor is activated by specific signals, triggering phosphorylation of the cognate response regulator. the phosphorylated regulator then actively changes gene expression of its target genes through binding of specific dna motifs  <cit> . in c. perfringens a major role in integrating environmental signals with virulence competes to the two-component virr/virs system, where virr is the response regulator and virs the membrane anchored sensor protein  <cit>  . the first virr regulated promoters have been located upstream of toxin genes  <cit>  and subsequent works showed that virr target sequences are formed by a pair of imperfect direct repeats, separated by 7- <dig> nucleotides   <cit> . these repeats are known as virr box <dig> and virr box <dig>  and are located within a core region of about  <dig> base pairs located immediately upstream of the - <dig> element of the promoter of regulated genes. the two virr boxes are both required for virr mediated transcriptional activation, and mutation of either of them drastically reduces the expression level of target genes. the binding of virr to its boxes is required for the efficient positioning of the rna polymerase to the promoter. furthermore in all the upstream regions of genes directly regulated by virr, the two boxes are in the same relative position with respect to the promoter and are on the same face of the helix. dna spacing and helical phasing play a crucial role in the transcriptional activation by virr, as demonstrated by the insertion or deletion of  <dig> base pairs in the region between vb <dig> and vb <dig> that displaces them on opposite faces of the dna double helix: in this situation a pronounced reduction of the expression level of genes controlled by virr was observed  <cit> .

the virr/virs regulatory network is not only involved in direct control of toxin encoding genes , but also of several other genes such as hyp <dig>  a gene encoding a regulatory rna  which controls the rate of transcription of cola, plc, ptp  and cpd   <cit> . a recent paper dealing with the in silico identification of virr regulated promoters in c. perfringens str.  <dig> followed by experimental validation, allowed to identify additional direct virr targets, namely virt, viru and ccp   <cit> . the former two genes are particularly interesting because they are regulators of gene expression. two genes only appeared to be controlled by virt , while viru is active with respect to pfoa, ccp, hyp <dig>  and virt. a mutational analysis revealed a clear parallel with what observed for hyp <dig>  because the gene expression level of their targets is unchanged in virt or viru nonsense mutants, with respect to the wild-type, allowing to conclude that the functional forms are the virt and viru rna  <cit> . moreover, three additional genes regulated by virr and coding for hypothetical proteins, were found in different c. perfringens strains: cpf_ <dig>  cpf_ <dig> in c. perfringens atcc <dig> and cpr_ <dig> in c. perfringens sm <dig>  <cit> . it is now clear that the two component virr/virs system is at the top of a hierarchical regulatory cascade where it directly stimulates the transcription of several virulence-related genes including three different regulatory rnas that are in turn able to control several other genes  <cit> . because of the large heterogeneity in toxin production by c. perfringens strains  <cit> , it is interesting to define the genes belonging to the direct virr regulon in closely related genomes to assess the degree of evolutionary conservation of the virr regulon. this could also clarify the evolutionary patterns that are at the basis of the divergence between these strains from a common ancestor. however the experimental strategy cannot be easily implemented for all strains, so that it is necessary to integrate information from different strains in a bioinformatics protocol. in this work we extend the bioinformatic approach of  <cit>  to scan the genomes and plasmid sequences of all available genomes of c. perfringens strains , and identify genes that are putatively controlled by the virr/virs system. we implemented a two step strategy allowing to consider information concerning virr binding sites in all these genomes and defining the core  and accessory  virr regulons in different strains. results obtained could help to better define strategies for pathogenicity studies and control strategies in c. perfringens and can moreover be used to design focused wet-lab experiments.

RESULTS
comparisons of c. perfringens strains
as a preliminary analysis we studied the variability of the selected genomes using both standard phylogenetic techniques and a comparison of all intergenic sequences. the alignment of rrna operons for a total of  <dig> nt was used to build a neighbor-joining tree revealing that these strains are closely related . in agreement with a low differentiation on ribosomal operon sequences, bootstrap support for the branching pattern was quite low; in fact,  <dig> variable sites only were found in the alignment, which were evenly distributed between strains . however, the comparison of a large number of intergenic sequences extracted from the genomes revealed that some of them are quite variable between the different strains with respect to the very conserved rrna operon .

regulon prediction in sequenced c. perfringens strains
the presence of virr and virs sequences was checked in all strains using blast and the functionally characterized sequences of str.  <dig> as queries. we found that they are indeed both present in all strains and that they are moreover always organized in what resembles a bi-cistronic operon with the two genes often overlapped . we scanned available c. perfringens genomes using the virr position weight matrix  derived from experimental observations, following the procedure reported in figure  <dig> . at the time we performed this analysis , the ncbi microbial genome database stored three different complete genomes for c. perfringens corresponding to strains  <dig>  atcc  <dig> and sm <dig>  plus the draft genomes of five strains  in the form of whole genome shotguns . despite the higher probability of errors in gene assignments characterizing draft genomes, we decided to include them to expand the scope of our genomic comparison. a whole genome scanning was performed using a pwm derived from the region comprising several experimentally validated virr binding sites  <cit> . a new pwm was generated from the targets identified in the first scanning by using  <dig> motifs found in the promoters of genes that are orthologous to known targets and then used for a second genome scanning. in this way we avoid the biases that affect the first matrix, obtained from only a few sequences mainly coming from one strain. after our two-step strategy, we collected all genes with a motif scoring more than  <dig> , which is the lowest value observed for an experimentally tested virr target gene . at this threshold we retained at end  <dig> occurrences of the virr motif. analysis of their location with respect to the start codon of the downstream coding sequence revealed thet most of them are at around  <dig> bp from the beginning of the gene . the larger distance observed for some of the motifs may be due to longer 5' untranslated regions or may account for some different level of regulation for those genes. the list of genes putatively regulated by virr was splitted in three different groups after clustering similar sequences , by defining the: i) conserved virr regulon as formed by chromosomal genes retrieved in at least two different genomes; ii) the accessory regulon with chromosomal genes present in a single strain; iii) the mobile regulon, including genes found on plasmids.

the conserved virr regulon
the conserved regulon , appeared to contain all known target genes  <cit>  with the exception of cpr  <dig> and virt. the former can be identified in the genome of strain sm <dig> only, while the latter has been found in strain  <dig> and atcc3626; in both cases we were able to identify a virr binding motif in their promoter .

one target only appeared to be conserved in all tested strains, corresponding to the α-clostripain gene. four genes were shown to be conserved in all strains but sm <dig>  interestingly, strain sm <dig> appeared to have the lowest degree of conservation of virr targets. a search for the corresponding gene sequences in the genome confirmed that they are absent, in agreement with a previous comparative analysis that showed the absence of several virulence factors and toxins and the presence of specific repertoire of genes encoding bacteriocins  <cit> . on the converse, missing genes in draft genomes cannot be considered as surely absent. concerning cpe <dig>  and cpf_ <dig>  corresponding to a regulatory rna encoding gene and to a gene with unknown function respectively, they have not been identified in some of the genomes, but using their sequences we were able to identify regions with perfect matching using blastn  and to locate virr motifs in their upstream regions . myers et al.  <cit>  showed that purified virr is able to bind the promoter of cpr_ <dig> and of cpf_ <dig>  from our analysis it emerged that cpf_ <dig> in str. atcc <dig> is the ortholog to cpr_ <dig> in str. sm <dig>  for which too we predicted the presence of a virr binding motif upstream. this motif is the same attributed to cpr_ <dig> and whose ability to bind virr has been tested by myers et al.,  <dig>  our comparative analysis, then suggests that the truly regulated gene could be the latter, because of the conservation of the site upstream of its homologs in two other organisms , while we were not able to find sequences resembling cpr_ <dig> in any other c. perfringens strain by blasting both protein and nucleotide sequences against their genomes. alternatively, the two genes can also form an operon, with cpr  <dig> performing an unknown function.

the accessory virr regulon
we consider this dataset low confidence for two reasons: first of all this group of genes comprises only one experimentally verified target, i.e. virt  and moreover, all other genes have been found in draft genomes only. the list of all putative targets of virr is shown in table  <dig> 

notably, jgs <dig> is characterized by an expansion of the virr predicted regulon, while the accessory regulon of atcc <dig>  f <dig> and sm <dig> strains is composed of a single gene. the case of virt, a regulatory rna, is particularly interesting. this srna implements a negative feed-back loop on some of the virr targets i.e. pfoa and ccp  <cit> . our analysis showed that virt is present in two strains only . we can thus predict that the other strains lack this negative control and express pfoa and ccp at different levels eventually by using additional regulations. actually, strains as atcc  <dig> produces large quantities of gangrene-associated toxins  <cit>  and jgs <dig> is a type e strain which, tough containing an enterotoxin gene , did not show enterotoxin production  <cit> . the relatively large predicted regulon  of jgs <dig> may contain genes responsible for its peculiar pathogenicity profile. within such regulon seven genes code for proteins of unknown function. one of them corresponds to a resolvase/recombinase  suggesting a possible scenario in which host invasion is linked to gene mobilization. the other two genes with assigned function in the putative regulon of strain jgs <dig> include a 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate kinase and a putative lipid a export permease. the first one has been associated with resistance to oxidative stress in c. perfringens mutants after transposon mutagenesis  <cit> . concerning the putative permease of lipid a, it is known that lipid a is one of the main mediator of bacterial pathogenesis and strongly stimulates in ammation in host tissues  <cit> , so that our prediction is reasonable.

the 'mobile' virr regulon
our analysis identified three targets located on plasmids, one coding for ϵ-toxin  in plasmid pcp8533etx from strain nctc 8533b4d, in addition with two hypothetical proteins, sharing 98% identity, in pcp8533etx  and in pcpf <dig>  of strain f <dig>  respectively. concerning plasmid pcp8533etx, we noticed that it is also present in the shotgun sequences from atcc <dig>  and also in that case we were able to find a virr motif upstream of the gene encoding ϵ-toxin.

plasmid analysis
plasmids can be transferred between species, and gene content similarities between plasmids can be used to trace gene flow between different strains. to evaluate evolutionary relationships relating plasmids from c. perfringens species, we performed an analysis to quantify the number of genes shared by each pair of plasmids. for this reason, we built the phylogenetic profiles of the proteomes encoded by plasmids in these strains. the phylogenetic profiles for each group of proteins were obtained by comparing all those proteins one against each other with the package blast2network  <cit> . a phylogenetic profile, or phyletic pattern, is represented by a matrix where each row corresponds to a plasmid molecule and each column to a given protein family. the cell at the intersection between row i and column j indicates the presence of a component of protein family j in plasmid i. a phylogenetic profile can be thus interpreted as a graph with two types of nodes: those corresponding to plasmid molecules are connected to nodes of protein families if the corresponding plasmids contains the gene encoding that protein. these matrices can become very large when many plasmids and proteins are involved, so that their analysis and biological interpretation is difficult. a strategy for dimensionality reduction can be through deletion of nodes corresponding to protein families and connection of plasmids directly, through edges that reflect the number of shared protein families . the obtained hypergraph is reported in figure  <dig>  where plasmids are connected by links weighted on the basis of the number of common genes. a group of four connected plasmids , including pcp8533etx and pcpf <dig>  was found. this finding is in agreement with previous data showing that plasmids pcpf <dig> and pcp8533etx evolved from insertion of mobile genetic elements carrying enterotoxin or etx genes, respectively, onto a common progenitor plasmid  <cit> . this group of plasmids is connected to a second group, composed of three plasmids  through a bridge represented by pcp <dig>  this implies that pcp <dig> shares different genes with plasmids from both groups i.e. it may be considered as an evolutionary link between the two groups, one including plasmids with putative virr targets and the other one with no targets. plasmids pcp <dig> and pbcnf <dig> seem to have acquired regions from different sources during evolution. interestingly pcpf <dig>  belonging to the first group, and pbcnf <dig> have been isolated from the same strain, but do not share common regions. the gene encoding the enterotoxin  is only present in pcpf <dig> and pcpf <dig> and the link from pcp <dig> to pcp8533etx and pcpf <dig> comprises the gene encoding β-toxin. these data confirm and extend the detailed analysis performed by  <cit> . they observed that plasmids pcpf <dig> and pcpf <dig> share a region of about  <dig> kb that it is not present in pcp <dig>  from our analysis it emerged that the genes comprised in that region could be conserved also in plasmids pcp8533etx and pcw <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in this work we exploited experimental information concerning a small number of promoters controlled by virr to predict the corresponding regulons in all other c. perfringens genomes and plasmids available. our results are in agreement with previous analysis and suggest that the size of the virr regulon is quite variable in the analyzed strains as also evidenced by works showing that these strains encode different repertoires of toxin genes. particularly interesting are the cases concerning vrr, viru and virt, because they encode regulatory rna that affect gene expression of several other genes. thus, even at the short phylogenetic distances spanned by these strains , there could be significant changes in the regulatory cascade initiated by virr. an event of gain or loss of a virr target can affect the gene itself only, such as when the event involves a gene coding for a toxin, or it can spread downstream of virr when it involves a regulatory gene, so that also its targets will be affected. as an example consider the regulation exerted by virr on virt in str.  <dig> . this gene is present only in str.  <dig> and in str. atcc <dig>  where it is regulated by virr. experiments have demonstrated that virt encodes a small rna able to repress the expression of ccp and pfoa and all these genes are positively controlled by virr. the loss/gain of virt or of virr binding sites in its promoter will thus have an impact on its own expression, but this will propagate downstream to ccp and pfoa.

the prediction of virr targets in the genome of strain jgs <dig> revealed the presence of  <dig> specific putative targets that could be important for the peculiar characteristics of this strain.

on an evolutionary perspective, we noticed that once one gene have been found to be regulated by virr in one genome, it is either regulated by virr in other genomes or it is lost. this suggests that many of these genes are useful only when controlled by virr, and also in this case, that their function is not essential for pathogenesis. then we can imagine that after loss of the virr binding site these genes are rapidly deleted from the genome; alternatively the deletion may involve both the gene and its promoter. this may happen when the deletion of relatively large genomic regions occurs. actually, genomes of c. prefringens strains have been shown to possess many different genomic islands which may be subjected to frequent events of rearrangemens  <cit> .
