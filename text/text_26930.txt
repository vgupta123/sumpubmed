BACKGROUND
mitochondrial genomes of higher plants are clearly different from their animal counterparts and from plastid genomes in terms of evolutionary dynamics of genome structure  <cit> . although the rate of synonymous substitution in plant mitochondrial dna  is 50– <dig> times and three times lower than in vertebrate mtdna and plant plastid dna, respectively, structural variations including changes in gene order, rearrangement, genome expansion and shrinkage, and incorporation of foreign dnas are more common in plant mitochondria compared to the others . the complexity of the plant mtdna structure has been attributed to existence of a reservoir of low-copy-number subgenomic mtdna molecules suppressed via nuclear control as well as the presence of repeat sequences dispersed throughout the genome that can mediate recombination .

structural variations in mtdna are associated with several mutant phenotypes such as cytoplasmic male sterility  and variegated-leaf phenotypes . cms has been studied in many crop species because of its economic importance for hybrid seed production. most identified cms-associated genes are novel chimeric open reading frames  generated by fusion of several sequence segments due to rearrangement of the mitochondrial genome  <cit> . although cms-associated genes in different crop species do not show significant similarity in their sequences, most share several features such as possession of a transmembrane domain and co-transcription with normal mitochondrial genes, which often encode atp-synthase or cytochrome c oxidase subunits . the detailed mechanisms of how these genes originated remain unknown, however.

complete sequencing and comparative analysis of mtdna of normal and cms lines has been performed in several crop species including sugar beet , maize , wheat , rice , rapeseed , and radish , revealing structural variation in mtdna and identifying genes responsible for cms . these studies showed that mitochondrial genome structures in lines exhibiting cms are extensively rearranged compared to those of fertile lines, whereas gene contents are mostly conserved  <cit> . for example, in sugar beet, normal and cms lines have mitochondrial genomes composed of different arrays of fourteen sequence blocks that are syntenic between the two genomes  <cit> . recently, tanaka et al.  <cit>  showed that the mitochondrial genome of a radish with cms, ogura cytoplasm, has a large cms-specific dna region in addition to syntenic block sequences. this region, containing the cms-associated orf <dig>  was postulated to be inserted into the fertile mitochondrial genome by recombination via inverted repeat sequences located on its borders. however, the origin of the cms-associated gene and other cms-specific sequences in this region are still unknown.

cms has been widely used in hybrid seed production in chili peppers. only a single source of cytoplasm has been reported to be responsible for cms  <cit> . kim et al.  <cit>  found two candidate cms-associated genes, orf <dig> and ψatp6- <dig>  the orf <dig> gene fused with a mitochondrial target sequence induced male sterility in transgenic arabidopsis  <cit> . in later studies, it was shown that the orf <dig> gene exists as a longer orf named orf <dig>  <cit> . further analysis of the function of orf <dig> protein showed that the interaction of orf <dig> with an atp-synthase subunit  may cause impaired atp synthase activity in cms cytoplasm  <cit> . the ψatp6- <dig> gene is the truncated form of atp6- <dig> that was generated by rearrangement in the 3′ region of atp6- <dig>  differences in the transcription pattern of ψatp6- <dig> between male-sterile and restorer lines demonstrated a possible association of this gene with cms  <cit> . however, complete sequence analyses of mitochondrial genomes to elucidate cms-specific mtdna structures and their evolutionary history has not been performed in capsicum.

in this study, we first report the complete mitochondrial genome sequences for capsicum. comparative analysis between cms and normal mitochondrial genomes provides insights into the evolution of mitochondrial genome structure associated with cms in plants.

methods
plant materials
a pepper cms line, ‘fs4401’ , and a restorer line, ‘jeju’ , which are known to contain cms and normal cytoplasm, respectively, were provided by monsanto korea. ‘fs4401’ is a breeding line containing a natural cms cytoplasm that has been used as the stable cms source in seed companies in korea and ‘jeju’ is a landrace in korea. for each pepper line, approximately  <dig>  seedlings were grown in dark conditions for twenty days and harvested to isolate mitochondria.

mitochondrial dna extraction
the method described by millar et al.  <cit>  and modified by kim  <cit>  was used for mitochondrial dna extraction. seedlings were homogenized using a mortar with isolation buffer consisting of  <dig>  m mannitol, 50 mm tris–hcl, 3 mm edta, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol,  <dig> % bsa, 1% pvp, and protease inhibitor cocktail  and adjusted to ph  <dig>  with koh. homogenized tissue was filtered with one layer of miracloth and four layers of cheesecloth. two rounds of centrifugation at  <dig>  g for 10 min were then performed to remove cell debris and larger organelles in cells. the supernatant subsequently was centrifuged at  <dig>  g for 10 min to obtain a crude mitochondrial pellet. the pellet was gently resuspended with a painter’s brush in isolation buffer without pvp, adjusted to 10 mm mgcl <dig> and treated with dnase i  for one hour to degrade nuclear dna. the sample was adjusted to 20 mm edta and centrifuged at  <dig>  g for 10 min. the pellet was gently resuspended in 500 μl buffer ii  with a painter’s brush. after resuspension, the sample was layered on a 30-ml percoll cushion  and centrifuged at  <dig>  g for 90 min. the yellowish mitochondrial ring in the middle of the cushion was collected. the mitochondrial fraction was rinsed with washing buffer  using three rounds of centrifugation at  <dig>  g for 10 min. mitochondrial dna was extracted following the method described by kim  <cit> .

dna sequencing
mtdna sequencing was performed using the gs-flx system  and the resultant single-read sequences were assembled by newbler assembler software version  <dig>   in the national instrumentation center for environmental management  .

sequence assembly
contigs were further assembled using the following strategies. first, analysis using the basic local alignment search tool  was performed against the genbank nucleotide database  to obtain mitochondrial contig sequences longer than 1 kb. the contig sequences that contained significant matches to known mtdna sequences from other species were used for the next analyses. in the second step, a dna library in which the average size of inserts was about 3 kb in length was constructed and the end sequences of inserts were analyzed using the abi <dig> sequencing system  in nicem . the mate-pair information of insert end sequences obtained by abi sequencing was used to order contig sequences. in the third step, primers were designed from end sequences of each contig and all possible combinations of primers were tested by pcr analysis to identify connected contigs. if a gap sequence obtained from pcrs contained only plastid-derived sequence, the gap was considered to be obtained due to contamination with plastids during mitochondrial dna preparation, not because of the existence of subgenomic mtdna molecules. through this step, gaps could be closed and the number of contigs was reduced. in the fourth step, genome walking from the ends of each assembled scaffold sequence was conducted using the genomewalker™ universal kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. in the fifth step, la-pcrs were performed to fill remaining gaps between scaffolds using takara la taq™ . finally, all information obtained by the stepwise approach was used to construct a master circle model that contained at least one copy of every mtdna contig. the contig sequences that could be connected to multiple other contig sequences were regarded as repeated sequences. these sequences could be contained in a master circle two or more than two times. insertions of repeated sequence were validated by pcr with primers designed from flanking regions of repeated sequences.

accession numbers of mitochondrial genome sequences
complete mitochondrial genome sequences of fs <dig>  and jeju  have been deposited in the genbank nucleotide sequence database under the accession numbers of kj <dig> and j <dig>  respectively.

screening a cm <dig> bacterial artificial chromosome library
bac clones containing cox <dig> or atp <dig> was screened from a 12× bac library of cm <dig>  which is a mexican landrace of chili pepper  containing normal cytoplasm  <cit> . the cox <dig> and atp <dig> genes of cm <dig> were amplified from total dna of cm <dig> using primer sets designed from sugar beet mitochondrial dna . the amplicons were labeled and used as the probes for bac library screening based on hybridization as described by yoo et al.  <cit> . the sequences of the selected bac clones containing both cox <dig> or atp <dig> was analyzed by 12× shot-gun sequencing, which was carried out in nicem .

gene annotation and characterization of orfs
the protein and rrna genes on mtdna sequences were identified using blast with the nucleotide and protein database in genbank . the trna genes were identified using the trna scan-se program . orfs that were predicted to encode hypothetical proteins longer than  <dig> amino acids were screened using custom-made perl scripts. the presence of a transmembrane domain in each hypothetical protein was predicted using tmhmm server v. <dig>  .

sequence comparison and repeat sequence analysis
alignment between target sequences was performed using the blastn algorithm . pools of repeated sequences were obtained by analysis using blastn in which a given target sequence was used as both query and subject sequence. the alignments that met the criteria to be syntenic sequence blocks or repeated sequences in terms of length and similarity were isolated and visualized as scalable vector graphics using custom-made perl scripts followed by manual modification.

RESULTS
assembly of complete mitochondrial genome sequences
we obtained contigs containing most mitochondrial genome information for a pepper cms line  and a fertile line  by sequencing their mitochondrial genomes using the  <dig> gs-flx system. however, it appeared that too many mtdna contigs  were obtained for each line when the high coverage of sequencing  was considered . the reasons for this were revealed in the process of further assembly of contigs and analysis of gap sequences. firstly, contamination with plastid dna hampered sequence assembly at the positions of mitochondrial genomes where plastid-derived sequences were located. secondly, ends of large repeated sequences remained unconnected due to the short length of individual reads in the  <dig> gs-flx system . therefore, we constructed a dna library containing inserts averaging 3 kb in length and analyzed the end sequences of inserts using abi <dig> for ordering of contigs . in addition, we performed pcr analysis and genome walking from contig ends to test all of the possible combinations of large repeated sequences with other contig sequences. the final circular molecules for complete mitochondrial genomes included every mtdna contig longer than 1 kb at least one time and were consistent with all of the results produced during sequence assembly process.

meanwhile, screening of a bacterial artificial chromosome  library of pepper line ‘cm334’ with normal  cytoplasm using cox <dig> and atp <dig> as probes resulted in the isolation of one bac clone containing both cox <dig> and atp <dig>  the complete sequence of this bac clone  was obtained by shotgun sequencing and assembly.

comparative analysis of general features and sequence contents between mitochondrial genomes
general features of mitochondrial genomes were compared between fs <dig>  jeju, and tobacco . tobacco is the only species in the solanaceae for which complete mtdna sequence has been reported  <cit> . the complete mitochondrial genomes of fs <dig> and jeju were  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp in length, respectively, significantly larger than that of tobacco . the proportion of protein-coding sequences was similar between pepper mtdnas, at  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, while it was higher in tobacco due to repetition of some genes  and smaller genome size. the ratio of chloroplast-derived sequences was slightly higher in jeju  than fs <dig> , and those values were about  <dig>  times higher than in tobacco . tobacco had a larger proportion of repeated sequences, mainly due to containing larger repeat sequences. the total length of repeat sequences was longer in jeju than in fs <dig>  the contents of genes encoding proteins and rrnas were the same between jeju and tobacco, whereas fs <dig> had an additional copy of the atp <dig> gene, named ψatp6- <dig>  <cit> . the number of genes encoding trnas were different between mtdnas. fs <dig> had one and four additional trna genes of chloroplast origin compared to jeju and tobacco, respectively.table  <dig>

bcomplete sequences of chloroplast genomes of fs <dig>  <cit>  and nicotiana tabacum  <cit>  were used to screen for plastid-derived sequences in mitochondrial genomes of fs4401/jeju and n. tabacum, respectively, based on the blastn algorithm. the value for n. tabacum was different from that of sugiyama et al.  <cit>  probably due to differences in methodology used to isolate plastid-derived sequence.


csequences longer than 100 bp and showing similarity higher than 95% between copies were considered repeated. in case repeated sequence units were overlapping, nucleotides that were included in repeated sequences at least one time were counted without repetition.

the tobacco line is ‘bright yellow 4′ for which the mitochondrial genome was analyzed by sugiyama et al.  <cit> .



sequence alignment analysis showed that most sequence content was shared between two mtdnas of pepper.  <dig> % of the sequence of fs <dig> could be aligned with jeju and  <dig> % of jeju with fs <dig>  in comparative analysis with tobacco sequence, only about  <dig> % and  <dig> % of each genome could be aligned with tobacco mtdna, respectively .

distribution of sequence blocks syntenic between pepper and tobacco mitochondrial genomes
sequence blocks between mitochondrial genomes of the two pepper lines and the tobacco line were defined based on similarity higher than 95% and matching length longer than 2 kb. these sequence blocks were then localized on each genome . in the alignment between fs <dig> and tobacco, a total of  <dig> sequence blocks that covered  <dig>  bp of the fs <dig> mitochondrial genome were detected. the comparison between jeju and tobacco accounted for  <dig>  bp of the jeju mitochondrial genome and revealed the same  <dig> blocks as well as two additional sequence blocks including one located downstream of cox <dig> and another on which nad <dig>  trnp, trnw, and ccmb were localized. most of the syntenic sequence blocks contained clusters of genes, resulting in high conservation of the gene clustering pattern between pepper and tobacco. however, four of the tobacco gene clusters, including atp9-rps13-nad1bc, nad4-rps1-nad5ab, nad3-nad1a, and rps4-nad <dig>  were not conserved in fs <dig> and jeju. the order of the syntenic blocks was extremely different among the mitochondrial genomes, demonstrating extensive rearrangement between non-coding regions.figure  <dig>

gene contents and localization on mitochondrial genomes
we next annotated and localized the genes with known functions on the fs <dig> and jeju mitochondrial genomes . the protein-coding genes were classified according to the functions of proteins; the  <dig> protein-coding genes shared by fs <dig> and jeju included nine genes for complex i proteins , two for complex ii , one for complex iii , three for complex iv , five for atp synthase subunits , ten for ribosomal proteins , four for proteins involved in cytochrome c biogenesis , one for maturase , and one for a protein translocation system subunit . in addition to these genes, fs <dig> had another copy of the atp <dig> gene . both fs <dig> and jeju contained three rrna genes , while fs <dig> contained one additional trna gene compared to jeju.

comparison of protein-coding gene sequences between fs <dig> and jeju revealed six genes exhibiting polymorphism in their nucleotide sequences . sequence polymorphisms in atp <dig>  atp <dig>  rpl <dig>  sdh <dig>  and atp <dig> resulted in a change in protein sequence, whereas a synonymous substitution was detected in matr. changes in the gene product length were predicted for atp <dig>  atp <dig>  and rpl <dig> due to in-frame indels, whereas length polymorphism in atp <dig> was attributable to a structural rearrangement . the atp <dig> gene in jeju showed high similarity with atp6- <dig> of fs <dig> over three-fifths of the gene, spanning 800 bp including the highly conserved region of atp <dig> genes  <cit> , whereas the sequence upstream of the conserved region could be aligned with the additional copy of atp <dig> in fs <dig>  ψatp6- <dig>  the nucleotide sequence and the structure of the gene-flanking regions of atp <dig> of jeju were different from any atp <dig> reported in previous research where two copies of atp <dig> genes were present even in normal cytoplasm  <cit> . comparison of the genes carrying nucleotide sequence polymorphism between the pepper species to the corresponding genes in tobacco showed that the polymorphic sites of matr and sdh <dig> in fs <dig> were the same as those of tobacco, indicating that nucleotide substitutions in these genes were probably not related to sequence alteration during the evolution of cms. by contrast, differences in the sequences of atp <dig>  atp <dig>  rpl <dig>  and atp <dig> of fs <dig> relative to those of both jeju and tobacco pointed to the possibility that variations in these genes might underlie cms .table  <dig>

a large number of genes were located close to each other, forming gene clusters that might be co-transcriptional units. in total, sixteen clusters were detected in fs <dig> and jeju, including rps10ab-nad1a, rrn18-rrn <dig>  trnd-trns, trnm-rrn26-ccmc-trnl, rps4-nad5c, rps13-nad1bc-nad4l-atp <dig>  rpl2ab-rpl <dig>  rpl5-rps14-cob-trnc, rps19-rps3ab-rpl16-cox2ab, nad1d-matr, sdh3-nad2ab, atp8-cox3-sdh <dig>  nad3-rps <dig>  trnc-trnn-trny-nad2cde, nad9-trnp-trnw, trns-trnf-trnp-nad1e . although numerous rearrangements between the two pepper mitochondrial genomes were detected, the clustering pattern of these genes was highly conserved.

rearrangements of genome structure between cms and normal mtdna
a total of sixteen syntenic blocks were localized on each genome . the sizes of blocks ranged from  <dig>  kb  to  <dig>  kb . block  <dig> and a part of block  <dig>  block  <dig> and parts of blocks  <dig> and  <dig> were duplicated in fs <dig> and jeju, respectively . the mitochondrial genome of fs <dig> had a total of eighteen junctions between blocks, whereas jeju had nineteen. in fs <dig>  sequences overlap between blocks were detected in seven junctions while no matching sequences between blocks were found at eleven junctions . among sequences located between blocks, the sequences between blocks  <dig> and  <dig>  and between blocks  <dig> and  <dig> were noticeable, accounting for  <dig> % of the unique sequence of fs <dig> mtdna. the orf <dig> and ψatp6- <dig> genes known to be responsible for cms  <cit>  were localized at the 5′ junctions of the sequence segments between blocks  <dig> and  <dig>  and blocks  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . in jeju, a total of nine sequences overlapped by adjacent blocks and ten sequences between blocks were detected . the sequence between blocks  <dig> and 6′ contained the largest portion  of sequences unique to jeju. most of the large sequence segments between blocks remained specific to each mtdna in alignment analysis with less strict criteria  and also could not be aligned with tobacco mtdna sequence . a sequence segment between blocks  <dig> and block 4′ in jeju contained a chloroplast-derived sequence specific to jeju . such sequence overlaps between syntenic blocks in one mitochondrial genome corresponded to repeated sequences located at the edges of blocks in the other genome. the sizes of this kind of repeated sequence varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp .figure  <dig>

end points of several sequence blocks syntenic between fs <dig> and jeju were located very close  to the edges of blocks shared by each pepper line and tobacco analyzed using the same criteria . there were eight and seven block end regions included in this category in fs <dig> and jeju, respectively. at least two rearrangement events, including one during speciation between tobacco and pepper and another during evolution of pepper mitochondrial genomes, were expected in these regions. no single sequence blocks that could cover adjacent ends of blocks syntenic between fs <dig> and jeju were detected in the alignment with tobacco mtdna except for two syntenic sequence block that were specific to the alignment between jeju and tobacco. this syntenic block connected the 3′ junction of block  <dig>  which was downstream of cox <dig>  and the 5′ junction of block  <dig> .

orfs unique to each mitochondrial genome
we next identified novel open reading frames predicted to encode proteins longer than  <dig> amino acids in length in the mitochondrial genomes. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> orfs  were detected in fs <dig> and jeju, respectively. comparative analysis of these orfs showed that  <dig> and  <dig> orfs had polymorphisms with orf counterparts or were specific to one genome in fs <dig> and jeju, respectively . fs <dig> mtdna contained  <dig> orfs with snps or length polymorphism and  <dig> orfs that were chimeric, whereas jeju mtdna contained  <dig> polymorphic and  <dig> chimeric orfs. when the localization of orfs that were chimeric or unique to fs <dig> was investigated to search for candidate cms-associated genes, seven orfs including orf100d, orf102l, orf108a, orf119c, orf <dig>  orf <dig> and orf <dig> were found to be close  to the edge of sequence blocks syntenic between fs <dig> and jeju . when we searched for orfs located near  repeat sequences  and containing putative transmembrane domains, six  and three  orfs were identified, respectively . the orf <dig> gene, a strong candidate cms-associated gene reported in previous research  <cit> , met the conditions for candidate genes for cms. although the other previously reported candidate, ψatp6- <dig>  was not classified as a novel orf because it was defined as a gene, it also satisfied all of the conditions described above . other than these two, only orf <dig> showed the same characteristics.

structure of sequences around orf507and ψatp6-2
the genomic region around orf <dig> and ψatp6- <dig> was found to be highly specific to the mitochondrial genome of the line showing cms in this study as well as previous researches  <cit> . therefore, the structure of this dna region was analyzed in detail . the orf <dig> gene was located downstream of cox <dig>  and ψatp6- <dig> was about 12 kb from orf <dig> in fs <dig>  in jeju, however, not only was orf <dig> absent, but also cox <dig> and atp <dig> were distantly located from each other, implying that rearrangements occurred between the two genes. in fs <dig>  two repeated sequences  and orf <dig>  which were overlapped subsequently by small number of nucleotides, were located downstream of the cox <dig>  sequences showing high similarity to ra were detected in fs <dig>  jeju and tobacco at the 5′ upstream region of the nad <dig> gene. the part of orf <dig> not covered by ra showed no similarity to other sequences in fs <dig>  jeju, or tobacco mtdna, nor to any sequences registered in genbank . however, in jeju, downstream region of cox <dig> consisted of sequence elements, cs <dig>  r <dig>  and cs <dig> that were located on different regions in fs <dig>  dna region around atp6- <dig>  also showed extensive dna rearrangements. upstream and 5′ regions of ψatp6- <dig> showed high similarity with the corresponding region in jeju. however, a repeated sequence rb and cs2-r <dig> sequence element composed fs4401-specific dna structure on downstream of ψatp6- <dig>  the conserved part of ψatp6- <dig>  rb, and cs <dig> sequence elements were overlapped subsequently by small number of nucleotides. stretches of sequences present only in fs <dig> were also detected on the region between orf <dig> and ψatp6- <dig> and the downstream of ψatp6- <dig> figure  <dig>

the short sequence elements that were detected on and ψatp6- <dig> in fs <dig> were present as repeat sequence only in fs <dig>  implying that these sequences were duplicated during rearrangement . in particular, r <dig> in jeju was duplicated downstream of ψatp6- <dig> in fs <dig> resulting in generation of a repeat pair around the ψatp6- <dig> gene. the orf <dig> gene and other related sequence elements seemed to be inserted between cox <dig> and r <dig> via multiple dna rearrangements.

comparison of mtdna around cox <dig> and atp <dig> in jeju with corresponding regions in cm <dig>  which is a c.annuum landrace introduced from distant area  and contains normal cytoplasm, showed that the dna rearrangement involving r <dig> resulted in close proximity of cox <dig> and atp <dig> to each other although sequence contents flanking the two genes were highly conserved. in addition, the gene order of cox <dig> and atp <dig> was opposite in cm <dig> compared to fs <dig> .

dna rearrangement pattern and localization of cms-associated genes in mitochondrial genomes of other crop species
the rearrangement pattern of mitochondrial genomes was investigated in pepper and other crop species including brassica sativus, beta vulgaris, zea mays, and brassica napus for which complete sequences of a cms-associated mitochondrial genome and at least one mitochondrial genome from different cytoplasm were available and for which the genes responsible for cms were identified . alignment of cms-associated mtdna with available mtdna from a different source for seven mitochondrial genomes identified numerous syntenic sequence blocks , as reported by many other studies . all of the genes known to be associated with cms were localized close to the edge of syntenic sequence blocks. in particular, cms-associated genes in pepper and radish were near the end of long sequences located between syntenic blocks. analysis of repeat sequences  showed that cms genes were always located near or in the repeat sequences.figure  <dig> 
localization of syntenic sequence blocks of mitochondrial genomes in other crops. sequence blocks showing synteny  between a cms line and a different line were depicted as blue-green color. mtdnas of cms lines were used as the reference genome in each comparison. distribution of repeated sequences  in cms lines is shown with brown bars and boxes. the cms-associated genes in each crop are indicated above the alignments. sequence blocks and repeated sequences are depicted in two layers to show the direction and length.



discussion
here, we report the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of pepper . this represents only the second mitochondrial genome from the solanaceae to be fully sequenced, following that of tobacco  <cit> . therefore, the mtdna sequence of pepper described herein is a valuable resource for studying the evolution of mitochondrial genomes in the solanaceae. the contents and sequences of protein-coding genes were mostly conserved between tobacco and pepper mtdna although small number of snps and indels were found in two and three genes, respectively. it was noticeable that the frequency of in-frame indel polymorphisms was higher in pepper than other crops such as rice  <cit>  and radish  <cit> . however, the overall structure and the non-coding sequences were extensively changed, resulting in less than 50% coverage of pepper mitochondrial genome sequence by tobacco mtdna. similar widespread rearrangements within a plant family have been reported from comparative analysis of arabidopsis and rapeseed mitochondrial genomes  <cit> , in which only one-third of arabidopsis and two-third of rapeseed mtdna could be aligned to each other. by contrast, small dna regions containing clusters of gene sequences were mostly protected from rearrangement events. the conservation of gene sequence clusters might reflect a requirement for co-regulation of gene expression on each cluster. however, rearrangements were detected even in the small number of gene clusters, including atp9-rps13-nad1bc, nad4-rps1-nad5ab, nad3-nad1a, and rps4-nad <dig>  that have been reported to be putative co-transcribed units in tobacco  <cit> . in particular, co-transcription of gene cluster nad3-nad1a has been confirmed experimentally in tobacco  <cit> , whereas we found that nad <dig> and nad1a were incorporated into different clusters in pepper mtdna. therefore, a change in co-transcription units has resulted from dna rearrangement during speciation or independent evolution of tobacco and pepper mitochondrial genomes after speciation.

numerous rearrangements of mitochondrial dna were also detected even in the comparison of cms-associated and normal mtdna within c. annuum species. conservation of gene coding sequences and clustering patterns indicated that maintenance of clusters may be essential for normal expression of genes or those sequences in transcribed regions have characteristics that efficiently suppress rearrangement. however, multiple rearrangements occurring outside of gene clusters resulted in the fragmentation of alignment units between genomes. several sequence blocks that were syntenic between genomes contained overlapping repeat sequences that might mediate homologous recombination and result in genome rearrangement. however, many sequence blocks were connected with sequences unique to each genome or had overlapping sequences that were shorter than 50 bp which was known as the lower limit of homologous sequence length required for recombination that mediates double-strand break repair  <cit> . this might be explained by lose of larger repeats during evolution after rearrangements occurred or involvement of nonhomologous end-joining  and/or microhomology-mediated recombination. comparative analyses on mitochondrial genomes of arabidopsis ecotypes and mutants revealed that dna rearrangement results from nonhomologous end-joining  and asymmetric recombination via intermediate-sized repeats followed by randomly occurring double-strand breaks of dna  <cit> . sequences lacking homology were joined by nhej, while asymmetric recombination is accompanied by repeat sequences longer than 50 bp  <cit> . recombinations via microhomologous repeats  have been also reported in pearl millet and maize mutants showing nonchromosomal stripe  phenotype . microhomology-mediated break-induced replication  have been proposed as one of the mechanism for microhomology-mediated rearrangements in plastids and mitochondria  <cit> .

a significant number of ends of sequence blocks syntenic between fs <dig> and jeju were located close to the junctions of sequence blocks syntenic between fs <dig> and tobacco or jeju and tobacco. therefore, those regions experienced at least two rearrangement events within a very short distance: one between pepper and tobacco, and the other between cms and normal pepper lines. why recombination frequently occurs in specific regions is still unknown although localization of dna cruciforms, localized melting due to high transcriptional activity, and stalling replication folks have been suggested as possible explanations  <cit> . further investigation on a large number of mitochondrial genome sequences in diverse plant families is required to identify and characterize recombination hotspots.

the orf <dig> and ψatp6- <dig> genes are known to be associated with cms in pepper, based on genetic and functional analyses  <cit> . comparison between complete mtdna sequences from cms-associated and normal cytoplasm in this study reinforced these genes as cms candidate genes. although a large number of orfs were specific to the cms-associated mitochondrial genome, only one orf  in addition to orf <dig> and ψatp6- <dig> had the typical characteristics shared by most cms-associated genes in other species: formation of the orf by novel dna rearrangement  <cit> , presence of a transmembrane domain  <cit> , and localization close to a junction of syntenic sequence blocks and repeat sequences . however, the potential association of other screened orfs including orf <dig> with cms also needs to be investigated because discrepancies in cytoplasm types and haplotypes of markers based on orf <dig> and ψatp6- <dig> have been reported in several germplasms  <cit> , which may due to incorrect identification of candidate cms genes or to the existence of a different cms source.

the genomic regions around orf <dig> and ψatp6- <dig> were clearly distinguished from other dna regions because they were included among the largest sequence fragments highly specific to the cms line and matched no other known sequences. recently, similar results were reported for radish ogura type cytoplasm in which the cms-associated gene orf <dig> was located on an edge of the largest genomic region unique to the cms line  <cit> . although the insertion of the dna region containing orf <dig> could be demonstrated to result from homologous recombination using a pair of inverted repeat sequences on the ends, the region around orf <dig> and ψatp6- <dig> in pepper contained more complicated structure, hampering the elucidation of the mechanism by which the genomic structure arose. the origin of the 3′ part of orf  <dig> and a large portion of the region around orf <dig> and ψatp6- <dig> remains unknown. one possible explanation for how these sequences came to be specifically present in the cms line might be substoichiometric shift , which has been reported in several plant species  <cit> . according to the sss model, subgenomic molecules of mtdna are present at very low copy number under normal conditions, in which recombination of intermediate-sized repeat sequences is suppressed, and if this recombination is activated , these molecules can be efficiently amplified by recombination-dependent replication and maintained as the predominant form of subgenomic molecules even in subsequent generations  <cit> . in fact, small amounts of orf <dig> and ψatp6- <dig> were detected by pcr even in fertile pepper lines  <cit> . therefore, the subgenomic molecule containing cms candidate genes that had been generated by rearrangements via microhomology-mediated recombination using short sequences overlapped between sequence elements  and/or nhej of sequence elements from diverse sources might be maintained at low copy number even in normal pepper lines. if the suppression of ectopic recombination is released under certain conditions, amplification of the cms-specific dna structure containing orf <dig> and ψatp6- <dig> might occur by recombination-dependent replication via intermediate-sized repeat sequences around these region. a pair of intermediate-sized repeats  of which one copy is located downstream of orf <dig> and the other downstream of ψatp6- <dig> might be candidates for mediating this procedure. however, prediction of the precise mechanism of the rearrangement is limited by the lack of information on the evolutionary relationship between the cms cytoplasm and a normal type cytoplasm in jeju. in fact, the corresponding dna region found in another type of normal cytoplasm from cm <dig> showed structural differences when compared to jeju implying the presence of multiple cytoplasm types that have undergone different levels of rearrangement . analyses of the mtdna region containing orf507-ψatp6- <dig> from different cytoplasms of pepper may provide clues to the detailed steps of the rearrangements. in addition, further analysis using high-coverage paired-end sequencing may facilitate identification of possible structures of subgenomic molecules to elucidate dynamic processes related to origin of cms in capsicum.

considering the specific characteristics of the cms-associated region in pepper, we performed analysis of the organization of syntenic sequence blocks, repeat distribution, and localization of cms-associated genes in six additional cms mitochondrial genomes from other species. in all of the cases, cms genes were located at the edge of considerably long cms-specific sequences between syntenic blocks and close to intermediate-sized repeat sequences or on the repeat sequence itself . none of cms genes originated by the fusion of sequences that are exist on predominant subgenomic molecules of male-fertile lines nor by small insertions or deletions on pre-existing sequences. these findings fit well with the notion that subgenomic structure containing cms genes might originate from multiple rearrangements mediated by microhomology-mediated recombination or nhej to create novel dna sequence regions and copy number increases due to recombination via adjacent repeat sequences. proximity of pre-existing low copy-number cms genes to intermediate-sized repeat sequences might be the prerequisite to ensure amplification of these sequences required for the induction of cms as discussed by davila et al.  <cit> . the close localization of cms genes to syntenic sequence blocks might be due to the need for sequence elements required for transcription of a chimeric orf. in arabidopsis, the majority of chimeric orfs were shown not to be transcribed  <cit> . this implies that utilization of promoters in conserved regions might be requisite for the transcription of orfs. these common features of genomic environment of cms-associated genes can be clues to understand the evolution of cms as well as provide a strategy to screen for unknown cms-gene candidates by comparative genomics approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of pepper were obtained in cms and male-fertile lines. a large portion of the intergenic sequences in the pepper lines could not be aligned with the mitochondrial genome of nicotiana tabacum, which is a member of the same family , whereas sequences and clustering patterns of genes were largely conserved. in the comparison between mitochondrial genomes of cms and male-fertile pepper lines, however, most genome sequences could be aligned although syntenic sequences were divided into eighteen sequences blocks that were generated by rearrangements in intergenic regions. the cms candidate genes orf <dig> and ψatp6- <dig> were located on the edges of cms-specific sequence segments that were between syntenic sequence blocks. the presence of many repeat sequences and connection of sequence segments overlapped each other by a few nucleotides implied that extensive rearrangements by homologous recombination and/or nhej might be involved in evolution and substoichiometric shift of this region. extended investigation using cms-associated genes identified in other species revealed that these genes are specifically localized near edges of cms-specific dna regions and intermediate or large-sized repeat sequences indicating the evolution of cms-associated genes might involve the common mechanism.
