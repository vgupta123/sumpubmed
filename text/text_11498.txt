BACKGROUND
protein-protein interactions are essential to most cellular processes. thus large-scale ppi networks can greatly contribute to our understanding of the cellular machinery at systems level. experimental techniques such as yeast two-hybrid assays  <cit>  and tap-ms  <cit>  have generated large amounts of binary ppis and protein complex data, providing the first snapshots of eukaryotic interactomes. unfortunately, the available experimental techniques are far from perfect, both in terms of their accuracy, as well as coverage. for instance, the yeast interactome has recently been estimated to contain from around  <dig>  up to even  <dig>  protein interactions between approximately  <dig>  proteins  <cit> . although already over  <dig>  yeast ppis have been reported, given the estimated false positive rates of the experiments, the yeast interactome is suggested to be roughly 50% complete  <cit> . using a more conservative definition and omitting indirect co-complex associations, the authors of  <cit>  estimate the number of yeast interactions to be ~ <dig>  and conclude that three idependent y2h assays cover only around 20% of this amount. in case of human, the entire interacome is estimated to be covered in roughly 10%  <cit> . furthermore, many doubts and criticism have been expressed in the literature regarding the low overlap between independent screens - originally attributed to a high false-positive rate of these experiments  <cit> . more recent studies  suggest that the low overlap can largely be explained by low sampling sensitivity and differences in assay types. considering all mentioned limitations, none of the existing experimental systems can provide a complete and error-proof interaction map of a complex organism within reasonable time and respecting budget limitations. as recently estimated, around  <dig> independent proteome-scale screens would be required to reliably identify each mappable interaction in a moderately-sized interactome of drosophila melanogaster  <cit> .

simultaneously with the development of experimental techniques, computational methods for predicting ppis have emerged  <cit> . these approaches complement experimental methods and can be used to validate noisy data, as well as to select new targets for screening experiments  <cit> . available computational techniques exploit various sources of evidence. among them are ones based on genomic data  <cit> , protein sequences  <cit> , phylogenetic profiles  <cit> , and classification-based approaches  <cit> . other methods explore the premise that interacting proteins often co-evolve and thus similarity of phylogenetic trees can be used to infer interactions  <cit> . approaches using maximum likelihood estimation  for inferring the probability of domain-domain interactions have been presented. the first of such analysis was performed in  <cit> , where the authors used yeast ppi data to estimate the probability of domain-domain interactions, and subsequently predict the interactions between proteins. finally, multiple data sources have been integrated in a bayesian framework in  <cit> . the last concept was further extended and applied to a wide range of heterogeneous data types from multiple species to construct comprehensive databases of functional associations  <cit> .

in this study we are specifically interested in techniques which integrate and transfer ppi evidence across species. in its simplest form, this idea is implemented in the interolog  mapping approach  <cit> , which predicts an interaction between a pair of proteins  if in another species there exists a known interaction between a pair , where a' and b' are orthologs of a and b, respectively. the transfer of ppi evidence across species can also be achieved at the level of conserved domains. in  <cit>  the authors devised a maximum likelihood method, similar to  <cit> , but using data from multiple organisms. in summary, the method estimates the probability of interactions between each pair of considered domains, based on the ppi evidence from multiple species. inferred domain-domain interactions constitute integrated evidence, which is in turn used to predict protein-protein interactions. a similar method, but using heterogeneous data sources , was used in  <cit> . in general, combining interaction evidence from different species makes ppi predictions more robust to experimental noise. false positive observations are unlikely to be reproduced across multiple species  <cit> . furthermore, evolutionarily conserved interactions are expectedly biologically significant. evolutionary pressures are more likely to constrain functional units such as protein complexes rather than single interactions  <cit> . hence, if an interaction has experimental support in datasets from diverse species, it is likely to be part of a significant functional module. highly probable interactions identified in a subset of species can be transferred to other species  <cit> , as was done in  <cit>  to predict missing interactions within conserved protein modules.

we present an approach which uses protein family phylogenies to accurately map ppi evidence between homologous proteins. contrary to previous studies  <cit> , the phylogenies are not used to assess protein co-evolution, but to account for evolutionary relationships when integrating data from different organisms. our current work builds on previously proposed cappi framework for comparing ppi networks across species  <cit> . cappi is based on a duplication and divergence model which mimics the processes by which most protein interactions are formed i.e. by copying from ancestral interactions during protein duplication and subsequently being sustained or lost over time. using this model we can naturally incorporate inter-dependencies between ppis and study the available data in evolutionary context. the only previous works based on these principles are  <cit>  and  <cit>  both of which concentrated on inferring ancestral states of the protein interaction network . our current work presents the first application of the duplication and divergence model towards genome-scale inference of ppis in extant species.

we use our framework to integrate and infer new ppis in seven eukaryotes: homo sapiens, mus musculus, rattus norvegicus, drosophila melanogaster, caenorhabditis elegans, saccharomyces cerevisiae and arabidopsis thaliana. we perform a comprehensive validation of our predictions using a go-based functional similarity measure and assessment based on reference datasets of binary and co-complex ppis. the obtained results demonstrate cappi's ability to identify a large percentage of known interactions in a blind test and provide new hypothesis for experimental verification when all known data is integrated. our method shows a significant advantage over the standard interlog mapping approach and a maximum-likelihood domain-oriented method. we also analyze specific examples of valid ppi predictions in well-characterized complexes in yeast and human , and show that core subcomplexes can be accurately recovered based solely on the data from the other species . many of the between-module interactions  are harder to transfer from distant organisms. finally, based on our predictions, we present hypothesis on new proteins interacting with the putative swi/snf chromatin remodeling complex in a. thaliana. our results are freely available at http://bioputer.mimuw.edu.pl/cappi.

RESULTS
we develop a comprehensive framework for integrating and transferring ppi evidence across species. our approach combines and extends the concepts of interlog mapping and bayesian data integration. as opposed to the interlog approach, we employ ppi evidence from all homologous proteins, instead of using only the best-matching sequences in each case. this strategy is advantageous given the sparseness of the source datasets from which new interactions could be inferred. it is also motivated by the fact that the role of an individual protein in one species may be distributed over several homologous proteins in another species. further, we use a bayesian modeling framework to integrate ppi evidence from diverse experimental sources, taking into account their reliabilities and coverage. the evidence is accounted for in the context of the families' phylogenetic trees and under an assumed model of network evolution, which assigns probability scores to events of interaction loss or gain following a duplication or a speciation event . intuitively, the closer a given pair of proteins is to another pair, the more impact the evidence for one pair has on predicting the interaction of the other pair. the amount and reliability of the evidence, as well as the evolutionary proximity of the observed interactions to the pair of proteins in question, determines the posterior probability of interaction computed by our framework. we apply cappi to infer protein-protein interactions in seven eukaryotic species: human , mouse , rat , fly , worm , yeast , and thale cress . the initial steps of our analysis preprocess the data and gather experimental evidence for interaction between members of distinct protein families. to this end, we identify groups of homologous proteins by clustering all non-redundant protein sequences downloaded from the integr <dig> database  <cit>  and pull relevant ppi data from intact  <cit> , mint  <cit>  and dip  <cit>  databases . the family-oriented view of the overlap of available ppi evidence for four best-represented interactomes is shown in figure  <dig> 

we consider two modes of application of our framework. first, the integration mode which gathers all available input data to provide a reconciled interactome view for each species. second, the prediction mode which predicts the interactions for each species only based on the evidence from the other species . to demonstrate the different aspects of our method and enable a straight-forward comparison to the previous approaches we use different combinations of the input datasets and different reliability values, yielding the following sets of inferred interactions :

cappi-integ: interactions for all seven species inferred using all available experimental datasets.

cappi-integ-3sp: yeast, fly and worm interactions inferred based on experimental datasets from ito et al.  <cit> , uetz et al.  <cit> , giot et al.  <cit>  and li et al.  <cit> , with reliability parameters set according to  <cit> .

cappi-pred: interactions inferred for each species using experimental datasets only from the other six species.

we compare the results of cappi with the following methods:

domain-ml: a maximum likelihood domain-oriented method  <cit> . yeast interaction predictions, based on experimental datasets of ito, uetz, giot and li, were provided by the authors.

interlog: an interlog-based method implemented in  <cit> . the program was downloaded from the interoporc website http://biodev.extra.cea.fr/interoporc/default.aspx and ran for each species using experimental datasets only from the other six species .

in the following sections, we investigate the performance of our method on large-scale data, as well as in small-scale experiments focused on specific functional modules.

integration of interactions in seven eukaryotes
cappi-integ provides an integrated and reconciled view of seven eukaryotic interactomes. our ultimate goal is to provide a higher quality interactome for each input species. to assess the potential improvement, we perform two separate evaluations using a go-based functional similarity measure and gold standard reference datasets.

go-based scoring
gene ontology  annotations are often used as indirect evidence for interaction. intuitively, the more similar are the annotations of two proteins, the more confident we are in predicting an interaction between them. we first consider the biological process  annotations and score our predictions, as well as the interactions from the input datasets, using the functional similarity measure from  <cit> . mean bp scores for the input datasets and for the equal in size prediction datasets are summarized in table  <dig>  the scores of self interactions  are excluded as they could introduce bias to the results . also, to avoid possible bias caused by the specific choice of proteins, input datasets are limited to interactions between members of conserved protein families used by cappi . for each cappi version in table  <dig> we indicate the mean bp scores for the input dataset and the inferred output dataset of equal size. for example, in case of cappi-integ the input yeast dataset contains  <dig> interactions, for which the average bp score is  <dig> . the corresponding cappi-integ score of  <dig>  was computed by taking the mean bp score of the  <dig> best predictions in yeast . for each of the species cappi predictions receive significantly higher mean bp scores than the datasets used for training. the most significant improvement over the input datasets is achieved in case of the y, worm and rat predictions. the mean bp score for the entire fly input dataset is  <dig> , while the cappi-integ dataset of the same size achieves a mean score of  <dig>  . in case of worm and rat prediction we observe a 29% and 30% increase in the bp score, respectively. our results show that cappi is able to produce reconciled interactomes which significantly outperform the input interactomes . a detailed view of the distributions of bp scores for experimental and predicted datasets of protein interactions in d. melanogaster is presented in figure 2a. the predicted datasets  contain a lot more high-scoring interactions than are present in the input datasets. interestingly, while the input-3sp for fly is almost as good as the input-7sp, cappi-integ-3sp is significantly outperformed by cappi-integ. this is largely due to the integration of additional high quality datasets from other species, from which cappi-integ can transfer new evidence when inferring the fly interactome.

the mean bp score of the input dataset and the inferred dataset of the same size are given for cappi-integ and cappi-integ-3sp. in all cases the inferred interaction set receives a significantly higher score than its input counterpart.

the improvement in mean bp score described above is achieved for relatively large predicted datasets . as we show in figure 2b, bp scores are actually higher for our top predictions. figure 2b plots mean similarity scores according to all three ontologies: biological process , molecular function  and cellular component , as functions of the number of predicted interactions. the mean scores for both cappi versions are negatively correlated with the size of the output dataset. this enables the user to trade size for quality, obtaining a smaller dataset, but of greater reliability.

testing against gold standard datasets
we further survey the performance of our method using a set of gold standard binary ppis pulled from  <cit>  and  <cit> , as well as co-complex data from the mips  <cit>  and cyc <dig>  <cit>  complex catalogues . once again, we score cappi predictions and compare them to the scores of the input datasets. the results are presented in figure 2c. the figure plots the ratio of true positive and false positive interactions present among a subset of a given size. the true positive interactions are either confirmed by binary ppis or known to participate in a characterized complex. unfortunately negative gold standard sets of non-interacting protein pairs are not available. we take a standard heuristic approach and consider pairs of proteins with different subcellular localization as putative negative examples. we note that in certain situations, e.g. signalling pathways, it is possible that interacting proteins are in fact in different cellular compartments. note also that in general true interactions constitute only a very small fraction of all possible protein pairs - at most  <dig> % in yeast based on recent estimates from  <cit> . this is reflected in our reference datasets. the positive reference used in this case contains  <dig> ppis and co-complex pairs while the negative set contains  <dig> differencially localized pairs . it is unlikely to identify a true interaction by pure chance alone. results presented in figure 2c confirm the previous observation that reliable interactions are generally ranked high by our method. it is comforting that both cappi datasets contain more confirmed interactions than differentially localized pairs among the top ranked predictions . note that a reference interaction can only be identified if a relevant evidence interaction is present in the input experimental evidence for one of the species. given that the gold standard datasets generally do not have a large overlap with the input high-thoughput datasets, many of the reference interactions will not be inferred by any integration procedure. importantly as shown in figure 2c cappi-integ-3sp has a much higher tp/fp ratio than the input yeast datasets  used for its training. cappi-integ integrates four more high-throughput yeast datasets and consistently scores higher than three out of four of these inputs - gavin  dataset has a higher score, but for a smaller number of interactions.

prediction of interactions in a blind test
we continue the performance evaluation by testing cappi's ability to predict interactions in a blind test. to this end, we compute the cappi-pred dataset by iteratively leaving out ppi data of one of the seven species and predicting its interactions based only on the data from the other six species. we discuss the assessment of yeast and human predicted interactomes based on the two scoring frameworks.

figure  shows multiple histograms summarizing the bp score distribution among yeast and human predictions, respectively. the sizes of the predicted dataset  have been selected to allow comparison with the interlog mapping predictions . interestingly, we observe that while the performance of cappi-pred is lower than cappi-integ in case of yeast predictions, the opposite is true for the predicted human interactome. this suggests that while the yeast input interactions are necessary for good prediction results, human input datasets, on average, bring a less notable contribution.

in figure 3c we plot the ratio of true positives and false positives as a function of the number of yeast ppis returned by cappi-pred. we evaluate the predictions separately using co-complex datasets , gold standard binary ppi datasets , as well as all available reference data  - see additional file  <dig> for details. an analogous study is performed for the predicted human interactome using the hprd  catalogues as reference . note that similarly as for yeast, also for human the positive reference set is significantly smaller than the negative reference set. the joint human reference set  contains  <dig>  protein pairs, which is less than  <dig> % of the number of differentially localized pairs - consistent with the expected ratio of true interactions to all protein pairs in human, as estimated in  <cit> . the results show that cappi is able to infer high-scoring ppis also in the case when no interactions from the predicted interactome are included in the training set. most of the top predictions are confirmed by experimental data. we observe that while more yeast predictions are confirmed by co-complex pairs than by binary ppi data, the opposite is true in case of the human predictions. this can be explained by the differences in size of the respective reference datasets for the two species . when all available reference data is considered , the tp/fp ratios for the top  <dig>  interactions in yeast and human are comparable .

filtering co-complex predictions
evolutionary pressures are more likely to constrain essential functional units than individual interactions  <cit> . thus co-complex ppis should be easier to map accurately across species. this premise was previously explored in  <cit> , where the authors showed that screening ppi predictions against conserved clusters improves prediction specificity. in an attempt to increase the percentage of co-complex ppis in our predictions, we filtered the cappi-pred output dataset, leaving only the predicted ppis placed within conserved dense network regions. to this end, an ancestral interaction network was computed as in  <cit> , and clustered using the mcl algorithm  <cit>  to identify dense clusters. each cluster was projected onto the network of the extant species  and cappi-pred predictions within the projected regions were identified as a result. as shown in figure , this procedure significantly boosts the tp/fp ratio for both yeast and human data . interestingly, while the fraction of co-complex ppis was increased, the fraction of confirmed binary ppis was in general lowered by the filtering , suggesting that many binary ppis placed outside or between protein complexes are filtered out in this case. this is in line with the observations made in  <cit>  that binary and co-complex datasets are of complementary nature and often have small overlap.

comparison with previous high-throughput multi-species approaches
numerous existing computational approaches for predicting protein associations in multiple species can be loosely divided into three categories. the first group of methods contains approaches for predicting interactions de novo from protein sequence. these methods often utilize evolutionary information such as phylogenetic profiles or gene fusion events, but they do not explicitly transfer pre-identified interactions from one species to another. the second group of methods takes as input experimentally identified ppis, integrates them and transfers the evidence to other species. the third group of studies is directed towards integration of heterogeneous experimental evidence such as ppi, mrna co-expression, phylogenetic profile similarity, co-localization, domain associations, etc., and attempts to predict various types of functional associations, not limited strictly to protein-protein interactions. cappi was specifically designed as a model-based approach for integrating and transferring protein-protein interactions across species and as such it falls into the second category. here we compare the performance of our method and two well-established frameworks for mapping ppis: the interlog approach and the domain-based maximum likelihood method.

comparison with the domain-based maximum likelihood approach
in  <cit>  the domain-domain interaction prediction method was generalized to multiple species and applied to infer interactions in yeast, worm and fly . as a final output, this approach predicts protein-protein interactions based on inferred interactions between conserved domains. liu et al. trained their method using ito, uetz, giot and li experimental datasets, so the their results can be directly compared to cappi-integ-3sp. note that only the yeast interaction predictions were provided by the authors. the mean go scores for domain-ml and cappi are shown in figure 2b. cappi-integ-3sp significantly outperforms domain-ml in terms of all three go scores. the performance evaluation using gold standard data  also indicates a higher accuracy of cappi compared to the domain-based approach.

comparison with the interlog-based approach
next, we compare our results with a popular method of interlog mapping. this approach, similarly to cappi, relies on protein sequence similarity to transfer the interaction evidence across species. we choose for comparison the interlog mapping implementation from  <cit>  and use the same input data for predicting our cappi-pred dataset . figure  provides the distributions of go scores for the interlog and cappi datasets of the same size:  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. cappi predictions also contain a larger fraction of highest-scoring interactions  and obtain a higher average score. the mean score for the cappi-predicted yeast dataset is noticeably higher than that of the interlog method . cappi's advantage is also apparent in case of the human predictions . to assess the significance of the difference in score distributions we performed the wilcoxon test which returned p-values <  <dig>  × 10- <dig> in all cases.

figure  shows the mean scores for the interlog output , which can be compared with the cappi rankings. in all cases cappi achieves a higher fraction of true positive interactions:  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  for the yeast co-complex predictions,  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  for the yeast binary ppi prediction,  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  for the human co-complex predictions, and  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  for the human binary ppi predictions. as we show in the next section, cappi recovers many known interactions within essential functional modules enabling the reconstruction of module subunits. the interoporc method is too restrictive in most of the studied cases , suggesting that a less stringent ortholog search is needed. in fact this is recognised in  <cit>  where more sensitive methods are considered for predicting interactions in cyanobacterium synechocystis. an additional advantage of our method lies in the provided ranking , which enables the user to easily identify the most reliable interactions. as an example, for the purpose of selecting human ppi targets for verification, one could make a heuristic decision to consider only around  <dig>  top predictions for which the tp/fp ratio is greater than  <dig> .

case studies: mapping interactions within conserved functional modules
we now zoom-in on specific examples of functional units in the interactomes of human, yeast and thale cress, and analyze co-complex interactions inferred by cappi-pred. in all described cases we demonstrate that the general topological features and organization of these complexes, as well as many known pairwise ppis, can be recovered by our method based solely on data from the other species. we verify the inferred interactions against previously reported experimental data and assess the significance of our predictions. for an example of how the threshold selection impacts the number of interactions and the resulting p-value see additional file 1: figure s <dig>  note that in the following discussion gene names are used to denote corresponding proteins.

human and yeast proteasome subnetworks
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is essential for eliminating damaged proteins and for regulation of intra-cellular level of proteins involved in wide spectrum of cellular functions  <cit> . it is conserved in eukaryotes, from yeast to human. the 26s proteasome complex contains a 20s catalytic core particle , which is capped on each side by a 19s regulatory particle . the structure of the 20s proteasome from yeast has been resolved  <cit> . it consists of  <dig> protein subunits: two α-rings  and two β-rings . the 19s proteasome can be further decomposed into two subcomplexes: the base  that binds directly to the 20s proteasome, and the lid , which is a peripheral subcomplex. in addition there is a number of transiently associated factors like p <dig> and s5b . we discuss our predictions of the 26s proteasome interactions from yeast and from human separately.

predicted interactions in the yeast 26s proteasome are depicted in figure  <dig>  overall, at the selected threshold we identify  <dig> confirmed interactions and  <dig> unconfirmed ones. the graph inferred by cappi is split into four parts that correspond to the four subcomplexes of the proteasome: α-ring, β-ring, lid and base. the α-ring and the β-ring have a dense set of interactions. both of them together form a clique , with most of the interactions being supported by experimental data. the lid and base are also very well represented and connected by  <dig> interactions, all of which are confirmed by previous experiments. we observe also the central role of rpn <dig>  which is predicted to interact with every subunit in the α- and and in the β-ring, as well as with six proteins in the lid subcomplex and eight in the base. another hub protein identified is rpn <dig>  which has twelve interaction partners among the alpha and beta proteins , seven partners in the base and seven in the lid . on the other hand, the transiently associated nas <dig>  is predicted to interact only with the aaa-atpase subunits  of the base subcomplex. in general, interactions within the core subcomplexes of the yeast 26s interactome are accurately recovered based solely on data from other six species, demonstrating a high level of conservation of these ppis. the vast majority of the  <dig> unconfirmed predictions are localized between the characterized subcomplexes. in fact only  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted interactions between the 20s catalytic core and and the 19s regulatory particles are backed by experimental evidence in yeast. the absence of experimental data for these ppis in s. cerevisiae might be explained by insufficient coverage of the yeast interactome or by possible rewiring events which changed the topology of interactions between the conserved core subunits across species. the discussion of human proteasome ppi predictions is presented in additional file  <dig> 

human and yeast endosome subnetworks
the escrt complexes comprise a major pathway for the lysosomal degradation of transmembrane proteins . we investigate the predicted interactions for the escrt complexes in human and yeast and compare the obtained results with the interactions reported in the literature. the list of proteins involved in these complexes was taken from  <cit> .

human escrt co-complex interactions as predicted by our method are depicted in figure  <dig>  cappi-pred was able to recover all five complexes discussed in  <cit> . these complexes are: escrt- <dig> , escrt- <dig>  escrt- <dig>  the vps <dig> complex, and the escrt- <dig> complex. interestingly, our results suggest that proteins chmp1b and chmp <dig> should be assigned to the escrt- <dig> complex. this association of chmp1b and chmp <dig>  has been recently proposed in  <cit> . moving on to the right side of the graph, we notice that the vps <dig> proteins together with protein vta <dig> form a triangle comprising of three reported interactions. a similar observation can be made for the escrt- <dig> complex , except that the interaction stam-stam <dig> is not supported by previous experimental data. also, the topology of interactions presented in figure  <dig> suggests an important role of the tsg <dig>  protein, which joins escrt- <dig> with three other complexes . tsg <dig> also takes part in five identified interactions within the escrt- <dig> complex, all of which have backing experimental evidence in human. please refer to additional file  <dig> for the discussion of yeast escrt complex predictions.

human mrna decay complexes
next we investigated cappi's interaction predictions between proteins involved in human mrna degradation . the subgraph of predicted interactions is presented in figure  <dig>  we have a very good coverage of the human exosome complex represented by six rnase ph domain subunits , exosc <dig> , exosc <dig> , exosc <dig> , exosc <dig> , exosc <dig> ), three s <dig> rna-binding domain subunits , exosc <dig> , exosc <dig> ), and an rnase d-like subunit exosc <dig> . this complex comes out as a complete subgraph  with no interactions with the other two complexes. the role of most of the subunits of the complex, in terms of interacting partners, is quite comparable. one of the exceptions is the exosc <dig>  protein which is the only rnase ph domain subunit predicted to interact with dis <dig> and two helicases . other exosome complex members interacting with dis <dig> are s <dig> rna-binding subunits exosc <dig>  and exosc <dig> , as well as exosc <dig>  exosc <dig> and exosc <dig> also have predicted interactions with helicases ski2w and skiv2l <dig>  in general, data on interactions of the peripheral subunits with the exosome complex are scarce, as reported in  <cit> , which makes our predictions a potentially valuable target for experimental verification. the second complex which comes out as a dense subgraph in our network is the lsm complex. it consists of eight proteins , forming a clique of predicted interactions, many of which are confirmed experimentally . the two proteins with the largest number of confirmed interactions within the complex are lsm <dig> and lsm <dig>  both of these proteins have confirmed ppis with six out of seven other lsm members . the third complex which can be retrieved from the network in figure  <dig> consists of two au-rich element are-binding proteins  and hnrpd ). all three interactions predicted inside this complex are confirmed by recent experimental data . among the unverified predictions is an interaction of this complex with the lsm complex  and with another mrna decay factor xrn <dig> 

a. thaliana swi/snf chromatin remodeling complex
in yeast and mammals, atp-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes belonging to the swi/snf family play an essential role in the regulation of transcription. in arabidopsis chromatin remodeling complexes are known to a much smaller extent. no plant swi/snf complex has been established and characterized to date, but it is highly probable that such complexes exist in plants . for this reason it seems desirable to employ a computational approach for predicting interactions in the plant swi/snf putative complex and generate plausible working hypothesis. we present a zoom-in view of the swi/snf putative complex in figure  <dig>  a larger zoom-out view containing other homologs of the putative swi/snf complex members is presented in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

the graph in figure  <dig> contains the core swi/snf proteins - the swi3-type proteins: at2g <dig> , at2g <dig> , at1g <dig> , at4g <dig> , together with the snf5-type protein at3g <dig> . this core is presented at the bottom of the graph. in addition to the above proteins we considered four groups of arabidopsis proteins which are reported to play a putative role in chromatin remodeling in this plant . these are: four atpases which are reported in  <cit>  as potential members of the swi/snf complex , at2g <dig> , at3g <dig> , at5g <dig> ); two swp73-type proteins , and at5g <dig> ); nine actin-related proteins , at1g <dig> , at1g <dig> , at1g <dig> , at3g <dig> , at3g <dig> , at3g <dig> , at5g <dig>  and at5g <dig> ); and three osa-type proteins . we excluded from the graph proteins which did not show any predicted interactions. altogether we identified  <dig> of  <dig> known interactions between the proteins visualized in figure  <dig> - the missing one is at3g01890-at1g <dig> . we notice some interesting peculiarities of the presented network. three of four of the swi3-type proteins, are predicted to interact with the four atpases. only one actin-type protein  has a predicted interaction with the swi/snf core and only two more  can be associated with the complex through member atpases. the ability to make distinctions within homologous groups is an important feature of our approach. while methods mapping interactions to highly similar orthologs usually make very specific predictions and avoid false-positives, they are also likely to miss many true interactions which can be inferred from slightly less similar proteins. as summarised in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the restrictive search applied in interoporc fails to map the known interactions in the swi/snf complex in a. thaliana. in fact according to the porc ortholog clusters, only two proteins  have orthologs in any of the other six eukaryotic species considered here. in this case, a less stringent method is clearly needed. on the other hand, cappi bases its prediction on evidence from all homologs and thus is in danger of loosing sensitivity and assigning the same interactions to all family members. the above examples demonstrate that we can avoid these potential pitfalls by considering family members in phylogenetic context when integrating and distributing the interaction evidence.

these observations are strengthened when we consider the larger family-oriented view of the swi/snf-related network in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  this graph was obtained from the one in figure  <dig> by expanding the set of proteins to all members of the considered protein families . interestingly, the four peripheral families represented in the graph can be divided into smaller subfamilies based on the interactions partners of their members. specifically, of the  <dig> atpases presented in the larger graph only the four above described are predicted to interact directly with the core of the swi/snf complex. two of them  and at2g <dig> ) have confirmed interactions while for the other two , at5g <dig> ) interaction hypothesis based on sequence similarity were formulated  <cit> . in fact the entire atpase family, as detected by our method, contains  <dig> arabidopsis proteins , which makes the presented predictions even more significant. these specific cases of confirmed predictions let us suggest that some of the distinctive members of the other protein families predicted to interact with the putative swi/snf complex , may pose valuable targets for future experimental validation.

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented a systematic phylogeny-based framework for reconciling ppi datasets across species and inferring missing interactions. our method naturally incorporates interaction evidence from different species and experimental sources. it considers the reliability of each source and the evolutionary relationships between protein pairs. the approach was successfully applied to compute integrated interactomes for seven eukaryotic species, providing confidence scores for each possible edge in each network. detailed analysis of our predictions indicates that we can accurately recover known interactions within conserved protein complexes. confirmed interactions identified in a blind test provide a strong case for our top-ranked predictions, many of which await experimental verification. we also find that while core subcomplexes can be accurately recovered based solely on the data from distant species, many of the between-module interactions are harder to identify this way, suggesting possible rewiring events. one natural direction for future research is to extend our framework to include other kinds of data which may serve as indirect evidence of interaction. the integration of heterogeneous experimental sources with account of the phylogenetic model may possibly improve existing catalogues of functional associations.
