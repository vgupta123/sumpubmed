BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is a metabolically versatile gamma-proteobacterium that preferentially thrives in aquatic habitats and the rhizosphere  <cit> . this opportunistic pathogen is the most dominant bacterium causing chronic airway infections in cystic fibrosis   <cit>  and has become one of the most important causative agents of nosocomial infections, particularly in intensive care units  <cit> .

the  <dig>  –  <dig> mbp p. aeruginosa genome is a mosaic of a conserved core and variable regions of genome plasticity   <cit> . the core genome is characterized by a conserved synteny of genes  <cit> . clonal complexes differ from each other in clone-typical segments of core and accessory genome  <cit>  and a nucleotide divergence in the core genome of  <dig>  –  <dig> %  <cit> .

intraclonal whole-genome variation in p. aeruginosa has mainly been studied in isolates from cf lungs that had been collected from the same patient longitudinally or at one time point  <cit> . the paired isolates from one patient typically differed due to a few dozens of single nucleotide substitutions  and small insertions/deletions  in the core genome, a few rgps in the accessory genome and occasionally one large deletion or inversion. close to  <dig>  de novo snps and indels, however, were gained in hypermutable strains defective in dna repair  <cit> .

whereas genome microevolution of p. aeruginosa in the atypical habitat of the cf lungs has been investigated for several clones, only a single clone has so far been assessed in its genome diversity between strains of unrelated habitat and geographic origin  <cit> . the two examined clone pa <dig> strains from california and germany were found to be of the same genome size and differ from each other in  <dig> % of their nucleotide sequence.

since these data alone do not allow any general conclusions, we wanted to explore the impact of habitat, history and geographic origin on intraclonal genome diversity of p. aeruginosa in more depth. for that purpose two complementary scenarios of habitat differentiation were chosen. the three selected clone cha strains were isolated from freshwater or cf patients at geographically distant sites within a 15-year period and represent the distant clone strain set. conversely, the three selected clone tb strains were isolated during a local outbreak and represent the closely related clone strain set. clones cha and tb were chosen because we wanted to include the highly pathogenic strains cha  <cit>  and tbcf <dig>  <cit>  in the comparative genome analysis. cha and tbcf <dig> are the only known p. aeruginosa strains which can escape killing by leucocytes. tbcf <dig> can persist and grow in leucocytes  <cit> , whereas cha kills leucocytes by type iii secretion-dependent oncosis  <cit> . genome sequencing was expected to provide an explanation why cha and tbcf <dig>  but not the other two clone cha and two tb strains could undermine the major antipseudomonal defence mechanism in humans.

genome sequencing revealed higher nucleotide divergence and a more variable composition of the accessory genome amongst the less closely related clone cha strains than amongst the more highly related clone tb strains. strain-specific snps were preferentially detected in habitat-associated fitness loci. conservation of small non-coding rna loci followed clone-specific patterns with about 7%  or 11%  not conserved. clone-specific traits were also found for the accessory genomes of the analysed strains, but especially for clone cha strains which were equipped with several strain-specific dna elements, the majority of which appeared to be of phage origin. phage-like dna also differentiated the accessory genome of the clone tb wound isolate tb <dig> from its relatives of cf-origin, indicating that uptake and integration of phage elements is a major driving force of intraclonal diversification of p. aeruginosa during adaptation to different habitats.

RESULTS
origin of the p. aeruginosa clone cha and clone tb strains
the clone cha strains cha,  <dig> and pt <dig> were isolated from sites in grenoble, hannover and mülheim in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. strain pt <dig> was isolated from a river, whereas strains cha and  <dig> are cf airway isolates. strain cha was recovered from a critically ill cf patient with advanced lung disease and chronic p. aeruginosa infection  <cit> . strain  <dig> was the first clone cha isolate from respiratory secretions of a female cf patient with normal lung function  <cit> . the strain was successfully eradicated from the patient’s airways by antipseudomonal chemotherapy and no further clone cha strain has since been identified in the patient’s respiratory secretions. the three clone tb strains were isolated from a burn wound  and two unrelated cf patients  during a local outbreak at hannover medical school in summer  <dig> 

shotgun genome sequencing
fragment libraries of cha,  <dig>  pt <dig> and tb <dig> were sequenced with the illumina genome analyser ii generating 36 bp reads as previously reported for strains tbcf <dig> and tbcf <dig>  <cit> . reads passing quality criteria  <cit>  were mapped to the pao <dig> genome sequence  in order to detect snps, indels and pao <dig> loci absent in clones cha and tb. contigs representing the non-pao <dig> loci of the accessory genome were de novo assembled from reads that could not be mapped to the pao <dig> reference.

comparison of the clone cha genomes with the pao <dig> genome
replacement islands
the p. aeruginosa core genome harbours a few loci that are subject to diversifying selection. clone cha is equipped with lps serotype  <dig>  pyoverdine type iia, a type-a <dig> flagellin and a novel type i pilin variant.

common snps
the three clone cha genomes shared  <dig> nucleotide exchanges  compared to the pao <dig> reference sequence, which were evenly distributed in the genome .  <dig> of these lead to a non-conservative replacement of an amino acid as defined by a dayhoff similarity index  <cit>  of less than  <dig> . table  <dig> lists these amino acid changes in the  <dig> proteins whose function have been experimentally demonstrated in p. aeruginosa . besides a few proteins involved in dna replication or secondary metabolism, the remaining proteins are transcriptional regulators, members of two-component systems, virulence effectors or are directly or indirectly involved in secretion or biofilm formation. non-conservative amino acid replacements were neither observed in any enzyme of the core or intermediary metabolism nor in any component of the basic transcriptional or translational apparatus. this comparison of the pao <dig> and clone cha genomes suggests that diversifying selection with impact on protein function has preferentially affected p. aeruginosa genes that encode elements for communication with the environment.

exchanges are given in comparison to protein sequences from the pao <dig> reference.

*the function of the encoded gene product has been experimentally demonstrated .

indels
nineteen small indels  were identified in the coding region of the clone cha genomes ,  <dig> of which were already known from other completely sequenced p. aeruginosa strains. the three frameshifts in the last codons of pa <dig> and pa <dig> or the stop codon of pa <dig> are neutral sequence variations and the three in-frame indels in pa <dig>  pa <dig>  and pa <dig> should modulate the function of the encoded gene products to only minor extent, but the majority of the other  <dig> out-of-frame indels are probably loss-of-function mutations.

indel is listed in the pseudomonas genome database for completely sequenced p. aeruginosa genomes: 1for strains pa <dig>   <dig>  c <dig>  pacs <dig>  39016; 2for strains pa <dig>   <dig>  c <dig>  pacs <dig>   <dig>  pa7; 3for strains  <dig>  c <dig>  pacs2; 4for strains pa <dig>  pacs <dig>  39016; 5for strains pa <dig>   <dig>  c <dig>  pa <dig>   <dig> 

five of the  <dig> indels are as yet undescribed in the pseudomonas genome database . two of these have no functional consequences as mentioned above  and one destroys the reading frame of a chemotaxis transducer . the remaining two mutations are located in the first orfs of rgp <dig> and rgp <dig>  both of which are known to carry clone-specific accessory elements and to be hotspots of genome mobility  <cit> . the frameshifts inactivate transposase/integrase genes and thus should fix these trna-associated genomic islands in the clone cha genomes.

gain and loss of start and stop codons
the loss of three start and stop codons each and the gain of eight premature stop codons were noted in all three analyzed clone cha genomes . interestingly another premature stop codon was introduced into orf pa <dig> in all three strains at the same position but by divergent nucleotide exchanges, a transversion in two strains and a transition in the third strain, respectively. two further nonsense mutations were exclusively identified in strain cha . the mutations affected transcriptional regulators, hypotheticals, glycolate oxidase and glu-trna amidotransferase operons. thus basic bacterial functions of metabolism and translation are impaired or lost in p. aeruginosa clone cha; i.e. glycolate utilization and the transamidation of misacylated glu-trnagln to correctly charged gln-trnagln.

snps shared by two clone cha strains
thirty one of  <dig> snps that were found in two, but not in the third cha strain, are located in two regions of genomic mobility that are prone to horizontal gene transfer  <cit>  suggesting that these snps differentiate variants of phage-related sequences. the only two snps sensu stricto were identified in intergenic sequences .

strain specific snps
the frequency of snps shared by two of the three strains was extremely low, but several dozen unique snps were found in each of the individual strains indicating some distinct microevolution in the clonally distant strain set . for instance,  <dig> strain-specific snps were identified in the environmental isolate pt <dig> . the  <dig> snps in coding regions target genes encoding enzymes, transporters, transcriptional regulators and hypotheticals.

the genome of the cf isolate  <dig> carries  <dig> strain specific snps . the clade of strain  <dig> acquired non-synonymous snps in  <dig> orfs including genes that should play a role during the colonization of cf airways. serine-to-asparagine substitutions were present in the two-component response regulator algb which activates the transcription of the algd alginate biosynthesis operon  <cit>  and the cytoskeleton atpase mreb which is essential for the maintenance of cell shape, chromosome segregation and polar localization of proteins  <cit> . the most drastic change was the substitution of arginine by tryptophan r771w in the usher protein cupc <dig> that is essential for the assembly of cupc <dig> fimbriae  <cit> . with  <dig> of the  <dig> strain-specific nucleotide exchanges in orf pa <dig>  this gene encoding a phage-like integrase was identified as a snp hotspot in strain  <dig>  and the unique snps were not evenly distributed over the whole genome .

strain cha carries most unique snps among the three sequenced isolates, i.e.  <dig> intergenic snps,  <dig> synonymous snps,  <dig> non-synonymous snps and two snps generating a stop codon . the predicted amino acid sequence was changed in  <dig> proteins including seven enzymes, six transporters and  <dig> ones of unknown function. moreover, the clinically highly virulent strain cha had acquired missense mutations in seven genes that are key for pathogenicity and adaptation to a habitat such as the cf lungs, i.e. a5g muca, a651p pelb, r101h exsa, r156h tse <dig>  l116f wspa, d514y pa <dig>  e721k cbra. the latter three missense mutations affect the chemotaxis operon wspabcdef and two sensor kinases of two-component systems. cbra has been demonstrated to be a global regulator of metabolism, motility, virulence and antibiotic resistance  <cit> . hence the e721k mutation in cbra should be a pleiotropic modifier of the bacterial phenotype. complementation experiments demonstrated that the change of an alanine by glycine in the n-terminus of anti-sigma factor muca  leads to the mucoid phenotype, whereas the  non-conservative exchanges l382r in algb and y50h in kinb of the alginate regulon  <cit>  were not causative for mucoidy in strain cha . the unique ability of strain cha among functionally characterized p. aeruginosa to induce oncosis of neutrophils and macrophages is critically dependent on its active type iii secretion system  <cit> . whether the undescribed arginine-to-histidine substitution r101h in exsa, the regulator of the type iii secretion regulon, has an effect on the regulon’s activity, is unclear. the non-conservative exchanges in pelb and tse <dig> are likely without any consequences for strain cha. the proteins encoded by the pel operon are involved in the biosynthesis of the pel exopolysaccharide and thus influence biofilm composition and antibiotic tolerance  <cit> , while tse <dig>  a recently discovered substrate of type vi secretion system of p. aeruginosa <cit> , can inhibit the growth of competing bacterial cells. however, any impact of the mutations in pelb and tse <dig> on biofilm stability or competitive fitness, respectively, is uncertain since both are not expressed in the cha background .

comparable to strain  <dig>  hotspots of strain-specific nucleotide exchanges could also be found in strain cha, as orfs pa <dig> and pa <dig>  both located in a region known for genomic instability  <cit> , had acquired nine and three snps, respectively.

twelve, six and five strain-specific snps were identified in intergenic regions of strains cha, pt <dig> and 491; one of which in each strain affected different srnas. seven strain cha - specific snps were found in the intergenic regions of pa0977-pa <dig>  and pa0983-pa <dig>  and thus located in the same region prone to genomic instability as  <dig> of the strains’ unique intragenic snps .

pao1-dna absent in clone cha strains
the clone cha genome lacks  <dig> pao <dig> orfs  the majority of which encode pyocins, phage elements or functionally yet uncharacterized gene products . twelve pao <dig> orfs only partially aligned with clone cha sequence reads indicating that sequence variation is unusually high in these orfs. all three clone cha genomes also lack the small non-coding rna gene  phrd, that is part of a phage-like insertion in pao <dig>  and  <dig> of the  <dig> intergenic srna loci identified recently  <cit> . another  <dig> of these loci were only partially covered by sequence reads of the clone cha strains . intraclonal differences were observed for two srna loci. the srna pant <dig> was absent in strain  <dig> only while pant <dig> was present in strains pt <dig> and  <dig> but absent in strain cha. both these pant-srnas are located in rgp-insertions in pao <dig>  and thus likely contributed to mobile dna elements.

strain-specific intragenic deletions of pao <dig> coding sequence were observed for two orfs in strain  <dig> and one orf in strain pt <dig> . strain cha showed a 426 bp deletion and, due to that, lacks the last  <dig> nucleotides of the global regulator gacs  and the first  <dig> nucleotides of the adjacent lactate dehydrogenase ldha . this two-gene spanning deletion generated a double mutant of key genes of lifestyle and metabolism of p. aeruginosa <cit> .

the clone cha accessory genome
accessory dna elements known from other p. aeruginosa clones
the clone cha strains share several genomic islands with the transmissible liverpool epidemic strain lesb <dig>  <cit>  . cha, pt <dig> and  <dig> harbour copies of les-prophage  <dig>  lesgi- <dig> and lesgi- <dig> of the les strain and a copy of an rgp29-insertion in the completely sequenced strain pacs <dig>  the three strains moreover share a few orfs known from insertions in rgps  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in other p. aeruginosa genomes  <cit>  , although none of these insertions is completely conserved in the clone cha genomes. otherwise interstrain diversity is pronounced among the three sequenced clone cha strains. each strain carries its specific set of accessory elements. individual variants were identified for the partially covered rgp <dig>  and rgp <dig> insertions in strain pa <dig> or pa <dig>  respectively, and for the mobile pagi-2/pklc102-type genomic islands. the clone cha strains also harbour different sets of phage phictx-like genes. variants of this phage either containing or lacking the cytotoxin gene ctx have been described for p. aeruginosa <cit> , and apparently such different variants have been acquired by the clone cha lineage, as the ctx gene is conserved in pt <dig> and  <dig>  but not in strain cha.

present parts printed in bold are conserved in all three clone cha strains. pairwise % nucleotide identity of the corresponding sequence contigs is given in brackets.

a majority of assigned contigs mapped on both pagi- <dig> and pklc <dig> references which share a large set of highly homologous genes.

b contigs also mapped on island pagi- <dig>  a variant of lesgi- <dig> 

the environmental isolate pt <dig> is endowed with the largest accessory genome. it carries several orfs of rgp <dig> and rgp <dig> and nearly identical copies of the genomic islands lesgi- <dig> of strain lesb <dig>  <cit>  and pagi- <dig> of strain c  <cit>  . strain  <dig> harbours variants of pagi- <dig> and lesgi- <dig> and phage sequences that are homologous to orfs in les-prophages  <dig> and  <dig>  the latter of which also found in strain cha.

novel strain-specific genes
orfs were designated as ‘novel genes’ if they had yet not been described in completely sequenced p. aeruginosa genomes deposited in databases by june 1st,  <dig>  the number of novel genes correlated with the genome size of the strain, i.e. least genes were identified in strain cha and most genes were detected in strain pt <dig> .

the strain cha genome incorporated a truncated variant of the pseudomonas phage b <dig>  <cit>  and an aacc <dig> gene that confers resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. the aacc <dig> sequence contig probably originated from an enterobacterial integron that has the highest homology to the enterobacterial type i integron harboured by plasmid p1658/ <dig>  <cit> .

annotation uncovered  <dig> strain-specific orfs in the cf isolate  <dig> . most orfs to which a function could be ascribed encode enzymes of dna metabolism or mobility or elements of conjugation and type iv secretion. the closest ortholog or homolog was identified for all orfs in beta- or gamma-proteobacteria that have been classified in the pre-16s rdna taxonomic era as ‘honorary pseudomonads’ because they share lifestyle, habitat and metabolic versatility with the ‘class i’ pseudomonads p. aeruginosa, p. putida, p. fluorescens and p. syringae <cit> . twenty-five orfs are shared with the metal-resistant burkholderiales herminiimonas arsenicoxydans <cit> . these genes are part of pagi- <dig> like islands harboured by strain  <dig>  and the beta-proteobacterium, but none of them is annotated as a metal-resistance contributor.

 <dig> strain-specific orfs were identified in the aquatic isolate pt <dig> . like in strain  <dig>  closest orthologs and homologs were detected exclusively among beta- and gamma-proteobacteria, but other genera, namely acidovorax, azoarcus, cupriavidus, ralstonia  and the true pseudomonads  were frequent among the closest relatives of pt <dig> orfs. the function could be predicted for a larger proportion of orfs than in the cf isolates, and a greater variety of functions could be addressed which is reflected by a much more diverse spectrum of functional categories/gene ontologies for the pt22-specific orfs than for those specific for strains cha or  <dig> . the strain-specific accessory genome of strain pt <dig> encodes enzymes of lipid and sulphur metabolism, the two-component system armrs, a heme lyase and a cytochrome c oxidase and multiple transporters including an efflux pump and a p-type atpase for heavy metal ions . moreover a paralog of the p. aeruginosa gene mvat was identified. mvat belongs to the h-ns family of small dna-binding proteins that are global regulators of gene expression  <cit> . five homologues have been identified in p. putida and two homologues mvat and mvau have been identified in the p. aeruginosa core genome  <cit> . p. aeruginosa pt <dig> is thus the first known p. aeruginosa strain with three mvat homologues.

comparison of the clone tb genomes with the pao <dig> genome
in contrast to the analysed clone cha strains, little intraclonal genomic diversity was observed for the three clone tb strains that were sampled during a local outbreak at hannover medical school. as reported earlier, only five individual nucleotide exchanges and one deletion each in a pilus assembly gene could be detected in the two cf airways isolates tbcf <dig> and tbcf <dig>  <cit> . though many phenotypic differences were observed, also the accessory genome differed by only one 81 kb ralstonia pickettii pagi- <dig> like genomic island absent in the first but present in the latter isolate  <cit> .

sequencing of a third clone tb isolate, the wound isolate tb <dig>  revealed some more intraclonal diversity, but still less than observed for the three clone cha strains. tb <dig> lacked six nucleotide exchanges that were detected for both tb cf isolates, but carried  <dig> individual snps not seen in any of the two cf isolates . tb <dig> did not harbour any deletion in a pil gene, but it had acquired a 9-bp in-frame deletion in a two component sensor gene and two frame-shift mutations in a phage gene and in oprd . the porin oprd transports basic amino acids and peptides but it also takes up the antipseudomonal agent imipenem. loss-of-function mutations in oprd as seen in the clinical isolate tb <dig> are a common mechanism of imipenem resistance  <cit> .

similar to the clone cha lineage, the conservation of described non-coding srna loci does not differ within the clone tb lineage apart from one exception. the srna phrd and  <dig> pant-srnas are absent in the three genomes, of another  <dig> pant-srna loci significant parts were lacking . the phage dna-associated srna pant <dig>  present in both cf-isolates but absent in tb <dig> made up the only intraclonal difference regarding srnas in clone tb.

comparison of the srna conservation in clonal lineages cha and tb revealed clone-specific patterns. while phrd and  <dig> pant-srna loci from pao <dig> were completely absent  in both lineages, clone cha lacked  <dig> pant-srnas which were present in clone tb. six pant-srnas, however, were absent in clone tb but fully conserved in clone cha. for another  <dig> pant-srna loci conservation patterns were partially divergent in the two clonal lineages . according to that, varying spectra of small non-coding rna genes in p. aeruginosa might contribute significantly to interclonal diversity but only to a small degree to diversity between clonal variants, if srna genes are parts of strain-specific acquisition of mobile dna elements.

clone tb is endowed with a large accessory genome including the genomic islands pagi- <dig>  pagi- <dig>  pagi- <dig> and pagi- <dig>  <cit> . the wound isolate tb <dig> lacks the 81 kb tbcf121838-specific r. pickettii genomic island and numerous phage-like orfs of phage pf <dig> and of genomic island lesgi- <dig> which were present in both cf isolates. conversely, tb <dig> has incorporated more than  <dig> kbp that are absent in the two cf strains. virtually all this dna is of phage origin including les-prophage  <dig> and  <dig> sequence  <cit> , of which  <dig>  or  <dig> %, respectively, of the dna were found in tbcf <dig> with nucleotide identities ranging from  <dig> to 100%. the closest homologues of accessory genome orfs were found in other p. aeruginosa clones, other pseudomonas taxa or in ‘honorary’ pseudomonads . the shuffling of phage dna apparently was the major driving force of microevolution of clone tb during the outbreak.

discussion
comparison of the sequenced clone cha and clone tb genomes
this study compared the intraclonal genome diversity of p. aeruginosa isolates derived from common and divergent sources. consistent with our expectation higher genomic variation was found among the clonal isolates with a more diverse spatiotemporal origin.

sequence variation was low among the three clone tb strains that had been sampled in summer  <dig> during a local outbreak. the two cf isolates belong to a small epidemic that tripled the prevalence of p. aeruginosa – positive patients at the cf clinic  <cit> . despite individual profiles of phenotype, strains tbcf <dig> and tbcf <dig> show only minute differences in their genome sequence  <cit> . strain tb <dig> was isolated from a patient with severe burns who had been treated at the intensive care unit for burns from which clone tb had initially spread to surgical wards and later to the cf clinic. the ancestors of the tb <dig> strain had incorporated numerous phages into the clone tb genome that were absent in the isolates from the cf lungs indicating that highly colonised burn wounds themselves and/or the associated hospital environment had tolerated or favoured the uptake of phages.

the three clone tb isolates had descended from a common source and the individual clades had diverged from each other by at most two years. in contrast, the three sequenced clone cha isolates were sampled from spatially and temporarily distinct habitats. correspondingly, the sequence of the core genome and the composition of the accessory genome were significantly more diverse among the three clone cha than among the three clone tb strains. in particular, the numerous strain specific snps in absence of pairwise shared snps demonstrate the distinct microevolution of the clone cha strains . conversely, shared de novo mutations and comparably very few individual de novo mutations highlight the close relatedness of the two clone tb cf isolates.

the environmental isolate pt <dig> was endowed with the largest accessory genome of the investigated strains. pt <dig> was collected from the river ruhr at a site with substantial anthropogenic pollution and contamination with industrial sewage . consistent with its source, the genomic islands of pt <dig> encoded genes for the detoxification of xenobiotics and the efflux of heavy metal ions. pt <dig> carried a copy of pagi- <dig> which also exists in cf isolates and cupriavidus metallidurans ch <dig> that had been sampled from an industrial site polluted with heavy metal ions  <cit> .

the cf airways isolates  <dig> and cha were retrieved from patients with the extremes of the general state of health that are feasible with cf as the underlying predisposing condition: the clinically highly pathogenic strain cha was isolated from a cf patient with end-stage lung disease, whereas strain  <dig> was recovered from an individual with normal anthropometry and excellent lung function. strain  <dig> was eradicated by antipseudomonal chemotherapy and no clone cha strain has yet been re-isolated from the patient’s respiratory secretions in the last seven years.  <dig> had gained numerous elements of genomic mobility that may confer some global fitness to the strain, but only a few amino acid substitutions in traits that may facilitate the colonization of cf airways. in other words, the microevolution of the  <dig> clade does not point to any pronounced selection of the  <dig> ancestry to accommodate itself to the cf lung habitat.

conversely, the ancestors of the strain cha isolate had selected numerous non-conservative amino acid substitutions in elements of chemotaxis, exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, motility and virulence. in addition, the genes gacs and ldha were destroyed by a deletion. the lactate dehydrogenase ldha has recently been demonstrated in strains pa <dig> and pao <dig> to be indispensible for microcolony formation in biofilms  <cit> . hence deletion of the 3’ end of ldha could alter biofilm formation although strain cha displayed mucoid growth on agar plates . the gacs/gaca two-component system controls the reciprocal expression of acute and chronic virulence determinants  <cit> . the deletion of gacs should abrogate this control. consistent with this interpretation, strain cha strongly expresses the pathways for alginate biosynthesis, a hallmark of a chronic infection, and the virulence effectors and structural elements of type iii secretion, a hallmark of an acute infection . deletions and point mutations in key determinants of virulence and the control thereof thus established a genetic repertoire in the strain cha isolate that is distinct from  <dig> and pt <dig> and should translate into the observed high pathogenic potential in the predisposed human host. this microevolution towards virulence seems to be quite specific for the inhabited cf lungs because strain cha was inconspicuous in standard p. aeruginosa worm and fly infection models  <cit> . strain cha apparently acquired signatures of a host-specific pathogen, whereas the  <dig> and pt <dig> clades retained the balance between environmental organism and opportunistic pathogen.

the clone cha and tb genomes share numerous prophages and genomic islands with the virulent and transmissible les clone, which has caused substantial morbidity in the cf patient population in the uk  <cit> . the relatedness of their genomes may explain why these clones are prone to nosocomial spread among predisposed human hosts and why virulent clades with uncommon pathogenicity traits have evolved in these clonal complexes. subsequent evolvement of pathogenicity arising from such genomic predisposition proceeded differently then in the highly virulent examples tbcf <dig> and cha.

in the case of tbcf <dig> only few sequence variations clearly differentiated its genome from that of the other two less virulent tb strains, mainly a loss-of-function mutation in tbcf <dig>  <cit> . while lacking of type iv pili on the surface and being impaired in twitching motility, tbcf <dig> was metabolically more active  <cit> , produced more outer membrane transporters and secreted more virulence effectors  <cit>  than its clonal variants. apparently the loss of pilq induced a global response in the tb background that is far beyond pilus biogenesis. any further mutations that are necessary to generate the unique ability of tbcf <dig> to grow in neutrophils must have already existed in the clone tb lineage. strain cha, however, exhibits numerous strain-specific gain- or loss-of-function mutations in global regulators or key pathogenicity factors that should be involved in the specific virulence features of strain cha like its capability to cause oncosis of neutrophils  <cit> . evolvement of the specific pathogenicity traits likely occurred by a series of microevolution events in this case.

CONCLUSIONS
intraclonal genome diversity in the two investigated strain triplets presented in a low number of strain-specific de novo mutations in the core genome and a variable composition of the accessory genome. shared snps were mainly observed between the two most closely related clone tb isolates from the outbreak. the number of strain-differentiating single nucleotide substitutions ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> snps for the most and the least related strain pair of clone tb and cha, respectively. correspondingly the intraclonal sequence variation of the p. aeruginosa core genome was 200- to 3000-fold lower than the interclonal sequence variation of  <dig>  –  <dig> %. in contrast to the highly conserved core genome a strain-specific signature was noted for the repertoire of phage-related sequences and genomic islands in the distantly related clone cha strain trio. strains shared islands and prophages that have first been reported in the transmissible les strain, but they were distinct in their pagi-2/pklc102-type islands that recruit their cargo from the extensive gene pool of the honorary pseudomonads. according to the annotation this cargo as well as the strain specific snps confer individual traits on the respective strains to cope with the demands of their habitat from which they were isolated.
