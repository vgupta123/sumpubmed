BACKGROUND
the delimitation of species and evolutionary relationships among them is fundamental to biology. however, the application of species concepts to putatively asexual taxa can be difficult and controversial  <cit> . not all species concepts can be applied to asexual species, and some researchers have even suggested that asexual lineages do not represent species at all  <cit> . for example, the morphological species concept  or biological species concept  may not be adequate for delineating asexual fungi  <cit>  especially where morphological differences are not observed. however, any new allele conferring an adaptive advantage to an asexual organism in a particular ecological niche may be selected. selective pressure on that gene is expected to affect the entire genome through genetic hitchhiking thus having the potential to rapidly form a new cryptic species  <cit> . these discrete entities may be recognized as species rather than as part of continuous distribution of phenotypes. asexual taxa are also expected to diverge into discrete lineages under processes such as divergent selection and/or geographic isolation  <cit> .

to date, the systematics of asexual fungi has relied heavily on phylogenetic approaches to study cryptic speciation among closely related taxa  <cit> . in asexual fungi, phylogenetic species concepts can identify phylogenetically distinct lineages with the implication that new species have formed that are not yet morphologically distinct  <cit> . these methods most often involve the concatenation of sequence alignments, using methods such as the genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition  which is an operational criterion for species recognition  <cit> . the gcpsr focuses on species identification through multi-gene genealogies and reciprocal monophyly to identify fungal species  <cit> . this method has applicability for both asexual and sexual lineages and species boundaries are estimated by concordant clades of multi-gene genealogies. the absence of monophyly and conflict among the multiple gene trees identifies species limits for taxa  <cit> . however, species boundaries of closely related taxa, in the initial stages of divergence, can be difficult to ascertain using multilocus phylogenetic methods because gene trees of recently diverged taxa can differ substantially in their evolutionary histories  <cit> .

processes such as incomplete lineage sorting, recombination, and horizontal transfer can cause discord among gene and species trees, masking true evolutionary relationships among closely related taxa  <cit> . incongruence, in itself, can signal possible recombination, reticulation, and incomplete lineage sorting. individual gene trees may have different evolutionary histories  <cit>  which limits the accuracy of species tree estimation using concatenation of loci  <cit> . incomplete lineage sorting is caused when ancestral polymorphisms persist through speciation events and each ancestral polymorphism can lead to different alleles carried among descendants  <cit> . coalescent-based methods, which stochastically join sampled gene lineages as they are followed back in time, have been developed to incorporate lineage sorting and the presence of incongruent genomic regions into phylogenetic estimation procedures  <cit> , even in the presence of lineage sorting and lack of reciprocal monophyly at any single locus  <cit> .

coalescent methods have recently been used to assess species trees for a range of taxa including sexually reproducing species such as the tennessee cave salamanders , tropical lowland birds , grasshoppers , and rice  <cit> . few researchers, however, have examined the utility of these methods for closely related asexual taxa that are morphologically indistinguishable  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses of closely-related taxa, such as rice  <cit> , drosophila <cit> , and cryptic fungal species, such as penicillium <cit> , are at the intersection of population genetics and phylogenetics where the effects of coalescent stochasticity results in high levels of gene tree incongruence  <cit> . estimating species trees for these taxa can be problematic; these methods could prove to be useful for closely-related asexual fungal taxa.

the putatively asexual citrus pathogen, alternaria alternata, provides an ideal case study for the application of quantitative species recognition using species tree estimation methods that incorporate uncertainty in gene trees. andrew et al.  <cit>  developed a species phylogeny for small-spored alternaria using four genomic regions including a protein coding gene and three anonymous, non-coding regions. significant incongruence was found among gene genealogies and several putative recombination events were identified within two of the non-coding regions indicating divergent evolutionary histories among the loci  <cit> . hypotheses to explain this incongruence included recombination and incomplete lineage sorting. a recent study of the mating system of a. alternata causing brown spot in florida found signatures of recombination  <cit>  but studies of the larger worldwide population of the pathogen are lacking.

currently, there is a large discord between the number of morphological and phylogenetic species that are thought to cause citrus brown spot. the fungus infects tangerines and mandarins  and tangerine x grapefruit  hybrids worldwide. when first reported in australia  <cit> , the pathogen was identified as a. citri ellis & n. pierce due to its morphological similarity to the causal agent of a postharvest disease, citrus black rot. since this time, the pathogen has been referred to as a. alternata ‘tangerine pathotype’ based on morphological similarity to a. alternata <cit> . further, molecular comparisons were performed using restriction fragment length polymorphisms  of the nuclear ribosomal dna  among  <dig> closely related, small-spored alternaria taxa. results from this study showed that morphologically similar alternaria species collected from different hosts and that produce host specific toxins shared common rflp fingerprints and identical its sequences, leading the authors to conclude that alternaria fungi known to produce host-specific toxins are intraspecific variants of a. alternata specialized in host pathogenicity  <cit> .

ten new alternaria species have been described from citrus hosts  <cit>  and phylogenetic studies have attempted to map these morphospecies onto phylogenies estimated from molecular data. using a worldwide sample of isolates, peever et al.  <cit>  and andrew et al.  <cit>  evaluated these morphospecies using phylogenetic criteria and found three distinct lineages . two of these lineages were found in florida , whereas the third lineage occurred only in turkey, israel, australia and south africa . these three worldwide lineages corresponded to several morphospecies including a. citriarbusti , a. tangelonis and a. colombiana , and a. dumosa, a. turkisafria, a. perangusta and a. interrupta   <cit> . peever et al.  <cit>  further tested the concordance between the  <dig> citrus-associated morphospecies  <cit>  on citrus using a broader range of isolates. peever et al.  <cit>  found eight distinct alternaria clades from citrus hosts that could be interpreted as phylogenetic species under the gcpsr concept. this incongruence between the number of species defined using morphological and phylogenetic criteria raises significant questions about the number of alternaria taxa that cause brown spot disease.

coalescent analyses of gene geneaolgies, which describes descendent/ancestor relationships where the gene of interest undergoes coalescence to a common ancestor, can be used to examine the evolutionary history of a gene backwards in time and can be used to incorporate incomplete lineage sorting into phylogenetic analyses  <cit> . currently, there is a lack of agreement among researchers about how many alternaria species cause citrus brown spot, ranging from as many as  <dig> species to as little as  <dig> species. the main objective of this study was to quantitatively estimate the number of species of alternaria causing citrus brown spot on a worldwide scale utilizing newly developed methods that incorporate the coalescent and account for recombination or incomplete lineage sorting. the evolutionary histories and recombination of known genetically distinct lineages, citrus  <dig>  citrus  <dig> and citrus  <dig> were evaluated from a larger worldwide sample of a. alternata tangerine pathotype and more loci in order to establish species boundaries of these previously observed phylogenetic lineages using gene sequence concatenation methods and several approaches that incorporate uncertainty in gene genealogies when lineage sorting and non-reciprocal monophyly of gene trees is common.

methods
isolates
one hundred and forty two isolates were collected from brown spot lesions on cultivars of tangerines, mandarins  and tangerine x grapefruit hybrids  in  <dig> countries, including argentina , australia , brazil , colombia , greece , iran , israel , italy , peru , spain , turkey , and usa . sixty-five of these isolates from australia, colombia, israel, south africa, and united states overlapped with a previous study . isolates from argentina, australia, brazil, colombia, greece, iran, israel, italy, peru, spain, turkey, and usa were sampled from tangerine hybrids in several geographically separated citrus groves within each country. australian isolates were collected from tangerine hybrids in the narara arboretum , and isolates from florida, usa were collected from a small area  in a single grove of minneola tangelo  <cit> .

dna extraction
fungi were cultivated in potato dextrose broth  for 5– <dig> days at room temperature on an orbital shaker at  <dig> rpm. genomic dna was extracted from powdered, lyophilized mycelium following the methods of peever et al.  <cit> , using either a qiagen dneasy kit or a phenol-chloroform procedure. extracted dna was quantified using a nanodrop <dig> , and a total of  <dig> ng was used as template for pcr. isolates were maintained in long-term storage on sterilized filter paper at −20°c as previously described  <cit> .

endo-polygalacturonase sequencing
each isolate was sequenced at the endo-polygalacturonase locus  <cit>  using primers and conditions similar to those used by peever et al.  <cit>  and andrew et al.  <cit> . this region has been extensively used because other commonly used genomic regions, such as ribosomal regions, mitochondrial large and small subunits, and the beta-tubulin gene, show little variation among alternaria isolates collected from citrus  <cit> . amplified products were visualized in 2% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. amplified dna fragments were sequenced directly on both strands following treatment with exosap-it  using the big dye terminator kit . sequence reads were performed on either a pe biosystems model  <dig> automated dna sequencer by the laboratory for biotechnology and bioinformatics at washington state university, pullman, wa or at elim biopharmaceuticals, inc, wayward, ca.

opa1- <dig>  opa2- <dig>  and flank-f <dig> sequencing
a subset of isolates with unique endopg haplotypes representing each sampled location  was selected for additional sequencing and analyses. additional loci included two anonymous, non-coding scar markers opa1- <dig> and opa2- <dig>  <cit> , and one non-coding microsatellite flanking region flank-f <dig>  loci opa1- <dig> and opa2- <dig> were previously used for phylogenetic studies of small-spored a. alternata <cit> . amplification and sequencing conditions were as previously reported  <cit> . clone sequences containing microsatellites  <cit>  were downloaded from genbank , and primers were designed to amplify the microsatellite flanking regions using primer  <dig>  <cit> . primer sequences for aa-flank-f <dig> were . twenty microliter pcr reaction mixtures contained  <dig> ng genomic dna,  <dig> × pcr buffer , ipswich, ma),  <dig> nmol of each dntp ,  <dig> pmol primer, and 1u of taq polymerase . cycling conditions consisted of denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> min;  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> min, 55°c for  <dig> sec, and 72°c for  <dig> min; final extension was at 72°c for  <dig> min depending on the optimal conditions for each primer set.

phylogenetic analyses and congruence among loci
each locus was analyzed independently. maximum likelihood and bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed for each locus using phyml  <cit>  and mrbayes  <dig>   <cit> . dt-modsel  <cit>  was used to estimate the nucleotide substitution models best representing each dataset. an kimura k <dig> model was selected for the endopg , and opa2- <dig> . the kimura k <dig> model with proportion of invariable sites was selected for opa1- <dig> . the jukes cantor  <dig> model was selected for flank-f <dig> . maximum likelihood analyses were performed under the heuristic search with tbr branch-swapping, and bootstrap support was estimated using  <dig> pseudoreplicates. for bayesian analyses, metropolis-coupled markov chain monte carlo searches included  <dig> runs with four chains each run for  <dig> , <dig> generations and ensuring that the average split frequencies between the runs was less than 1%. trees were sampled every  <dig> generations. each run generated  <dig>  trees of which the first  <dig>  trees  were discarded as “burnin”, as visually determined by evaluating log files in tracer version  <dig>   <cit> .

in order to test topology congruence among phylogenies from different loci, the shimodaira-hasegawa  test of topological congruence  <cit>  was conducted on the bayesian phylogenies as implemented in paup*10_4b  <cit>  with  <dig> rell resampling replicates.

coalescent analyses
ancestral histories of the citrus brown spot lineages were estimated using the coalescent  <cit> . sequence data were aligned and edited manually by eye and using clustalw implemented in bioedit v <dig> . <dig> for windows  <cit> . isolates were assigned to haplotypes using dnasp v  <dig>   <cit> . to verify the suitability of each locus for coalescent analyses, the neutrality of each locus was estimated using fu and li’s d and tajima’s d and potential recombination within each locus was examined using rmin  <cit>  as implemented in dnasp. incompatibility matrices  <cit>  were estimated in snap clade and snap matrix as implemented in snap workbench  <cit>  to visualize incompatible nucleotide sites, such as those arising from recombination or recurrent mutation. sequences were collapsed into unique haplotypes using snap map  <cit>  and sites version  <dig>   <cit>  by removing indels and incompatible sites.

evolutionary histories were simulated using coalescent analyses for each locus. two loci flank- <dig> and opa1- <dig> showed evidence for recombination and therefore coalescent analyses for all genomic regions were implemented using recom version  <dig>  , which allows for coalescent analyses with recombination, assuming the infinite-sites model, neutral evolution, panmixia and constant population size  <cit> . using a haploid coalescent model, recom <dig>  estimates population recombination rate, ρ,  and mutation rate, θ . these estimates were then used to obtain estimates of the number of recombination events and the time to the most recent common ancestor . for all analyses, the ancestral state of each segregating site was estimated by comparing each site to that of a. tomato isolate bmp <dig>  <cit> . sites which had ambiguous ancestral states were removed from the datasets. opa1- <dig> had five sites  with three states and one site  with four states, and the endopg had one site  with three states. coalescent analyses were performed in snap workbench  <cit> , with five independent runs  per genomic region to ensure convergence for each parameter estimate. conditions were switched to + b for genomic region opa1- <dig>  which aborts low probability paths and returns to zero. gene geneaologies and minimal recombination graphs  were constructed to graphically represent the evolutionary history of the citrus lineages estimated by the coalescent. no putative recombination events were detected within endopg and opa2- <dig>  genetree  <cit> , which assumes coalescent analyses without recombination, was used to estimate the coalescent gene genealogies for these regions and compared to the recom <dig>  results. five independent simulations with  <dig> million runs each were conducted on haplotypes of each region to estimate the ages of mutations and the tmrca, as inferred by an a. tomato rooted tree, to assess convergence. a graph of the tree was generated with coalescent unit times using treepic  <cit> . an ancestral recombination graph  can be used to visualize a recombining coalescent history that cannot be displayed using a bifurcating tree  <cit> . the ancestral history of the recombining opa1- <dig> and flank-f <dig> haplotypes were reconstructed using a parsimony approach that accounts for both mutation and recombination backwards in time. beagle  <cit>  was used to produce an arg for flank-f <dig>  whereas kwarg was used for opa1- <dig>  <cit> . beagle computes minimum recombination histories with an exhaustive approach. kwarg, on the other hand, implements a heuristic search for plausible histories and does not guarantee the minimal recombination history. beagle was run for both genomic regions, however due to the increased complexity and putative number of recombination events within opa1- <dig>  each trial run crashed.

species tree estimation
four methods were used to estimate species trees among the four gene trees. these included concatenation, genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition , minimizing deep coalescence , and a mixture of coalescent and the yule process   <cit> . for mdc and *beast, taxa are required to be assigned to species a priori. therefore, taxa were assigned to species based on identified endopg clades .

a phylogeny of the concatenated dataset was implemented in mrbayes. loci were partitioned and the previously estimated evolutionary models were used for bayesian analyses. metropolis-coupled markov chain monte carlo searches included  <dig> runs with four chains each run for  <dig> , <dig> generations and ensuring that the average split frequencies between the runs was less than 1%. each run generated  <dig>  trees of which the first  <dig>  trees  were discarded as “burnin”.

gcpsr identifies species boundaries by comparing multiple gene trees among the same set of taxa  <cit> . putative species are identified when representatives of a species formed well-supported clades  in all gene trees  <cit> . bayesian and likelihood tree searches were used to estimate species within the citrus brown spot worldwide population according to gcpsr criteria.

the mdc approach assumes that discordance of gene trees is the result of incomplete lineage sorting  <cit> . the deep coalescence measure is a count of the number of extra gene lineages that result from fitting a gene tree into a species tree, thereby summing the extra gene lineages as a measure of discordance. mdc then searches for a species tree by minimizing the number of deep coalescences across loci. mdc analysis was implemented in mesquite v <dig>   <cit> . gene tree uncertainty was accommodated into species tree inference by resampling  the posterior probability of tree topologies obtained from the bayesian phylogenetic analyses using the mesquite software module augist  <cit> . to fit the gene trees into a species tree that minimized the number of deep coalescence across loci, gene trees were considered rooted  and a heuristic search utilizing subtree pruning and re-grafting was used. all equally parsimonious species trees were retained, and a 50% majority-rule consensus tree was generated. biparition frequencies for nodes were used as measures of species tree uncertainty.

*beast generates posterior samples by simultaneously estimating gene and species trees under a hierarchical coalescent model while allowing for independent evolutionary processes in each genomic region. beauti version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  was used to create xml-formatted input files for *beast v <dig> . <dig>  substitution models were chosen as previously described and were unlinked across genes with parameters estimated separately for each gene. as a needed prior in *beast, isolates were assigned to species groups under the traits tab based on the three clades identified in the endopg phylogeny. evolutionary rates were estimated under a yule process  <cit> . a yule model was chosen as the species tree prior, which assumes a constant lineage birth rate for each branch in the tree. this tree prior is most suitable for trees describing the relationships between individuals from different species and is often thought of as describing the net rate of speciation  <cit> . species tree estimations were carried out based on strict molecular clock assumption, following the methods of heled and drummond  <cit> . data sets were run for  <dig> million generations in beast, sampling every  <dig>  generations. analyses were performed twice. postburnin trees were combined with the program logcombiner , and chains were assumed to converge when the average standard deviation of split frequencies was found to be <  <dig> . the maximum clade credibility tree with posterior probability of each node was computed with the program treeannotator . log files were evaluated in tracer version  <dig>   <cit> . the species tree was calculated using treeannotator version  <dig> . <dig> with a burn-in of  <dig> trees. figtree version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  was used to visualize the consensus tree node ages, branch lengths and posterior probabilities.

RESULTS
worldwide phylogenetic lineages
alternaria alternata sampled from tangerine and tangerine hybrids on a worldwide scale  revealed a total of  <dig> endopg haplotypes . bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses of endopg resulted in two phylogenetic lineages using a  <dig> posterior probability and  <dig> bootstrap value criterion   <cit> . these two lineages are subsequently referred to as ‘citrus 2’ and ‘citrus 3’. all other haplotypes  were placed into another group called citrus  <dig> based on previously published results that showed the existence of three lineages  <cit> .

coalesence analyses
thirty-five representative isolates were selected based on unique endopg haplotype and geographical location to resolve the ancestral histories of the lineages using coalescent-based approaches. neutrality and intra-locus recombination rates were estimated for all the genomic regions using d  statistics and rmin. we were unable to reject the null hypothesis of neutrality for two loci .

coalescent-derived gene genealogies were estimated for the two non-recombining loci, endopg and opa2- <dig> . in the endopg genealogy, isolates of the citrus  <dig> lineage were positioned ancestral to all other haplotypes by several mutations . in locus opa2– <dig> signals of incomplete lineage sorting, where ancestral polymorphisms have not been sorted, were evident . for example, some isolates from citrus  <dig> and citrus  <dig> were interspersed among identified clades, suggestive of non-reciprocal monophyly . further, little variation was revealed in the opa2- <dig> genealogy, but eleven mutations, respectively, separated the a. alternata lineages from the a. tomato outgroup. isolates from all lineages shared haplotypes, such that isolates from lineages citrus  <dig> and  <dig> formed a paraphyletic group. this was also observed in the opa2- <dig>  where haplotypes d and g included isolates from lineages citrus  <dig> and  <dig>  two clusters were formed, one including isolates from citrus  <dig> and  <dig>  while the other included a polytomy of haplotypes from the citrus  <dig> and citrus  <dig> lineages .

loci opa1- <dig> and flank-f <dig> had evolutionary histories of recombination. three recombination events were observed in flank-f <dig>  which in all cases involved isolates from lineage citrus  <dig> and  <dig> . opa1– <dig> had the most complex evolutionary history involving eight recombination events . these events included isolates from all three lineages suggesting possibly a sexual past as suggested by berbee et al.  <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses
analyses were conducted for each locus independently for  <dig> isolates with representative endopg haplotypes selected from the original worldwide sample. analysis of endopg yielded a phylogeny with similar topology to that estimated among the total worldwide sample, supporting three clades . eight haplotypes were identified in locus opa2- <dig>  however no monophyly was observed in the lineages . a total of  <dig> haplotypes were identified locus flank- <dig> . only one well-supported clade was found, including all isolates from citrus  <dig>  locus opa1- <dig>  with  <dig> haplotypes, had the most phylogenetic resolution, resulting in six well-supported clades . among  <dig> sites,  <dig> sites  were polymorphic. of these,  <dig>  were parsimony informative . of these clades, one corresponded to a terminal clade including all citrus  <dig> haplotypes, clearly separated from but sister to one citrus  <dig> haplotype, and polyphyletic relationships were observed in lineages  <dig> and  <dig> .

divergence time estimation for the endopg
a total of six synonymous nucleotide changes were observed when comparing haplotypes of the citrus lineages  <dig> and  <dig> against haplotypes from citrus  <dig>  though only a portion of the cds region was analyzed , using the published rates for neutral gene substitution rate of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> and  <dig>  × 10− <dig> <cit>  resulted in a divergence date of at least  <dig>  thousand years before present.

estimation of species trees from phylogenetically incongruent gene genealogies
in the phylogenies from the concatenated and individual datasets, lineages citrus  <dig> and  <dig> were polyphyletic. support for the citrus  <dig> lineage was found in most gene trees when gcpsr criteria was applied . the citrus  <dig> and  <dig> lineages were only well-supported in the endopg phylogeny and thus constituted a single, polyphyletic species when the other loci were considered.

congruence of tree topology was tested and statistically significant incongruence was detected for all pairwise comparisons of all loci with opa1- <dig>  using shimodaira-hasegawa tests . all other pairwise comparisons were non-significant.the phylogeny generated from the concatenated dataset yielded four well-supported clades with topology similar to the endopg phylogeny . the citrus  <dig> and  <dig> lineages were again polyphyletic, with individuals from each falling into three clades. however, lineage citrus  <dig> separated into one monophyletic well-supported  lineage.little support for multiple species was obtained using the mdc approach. in the mdc-estimated species tree, all lineages clustered into one clade with high bi-partition frequency  . in contrast, *beast analyses revealed two well-supported species, citrus  <dig> and a second species comprising lineages citrus  <dig> and  <dig> .

discussion
coalescent-based approaches and ancestral recombination graphs were used to elucidate the evolutionary history of the citrus brown spot pathogen on a worldwide scale and quantitatively estimate the number of species causing this disease. the evolutionary history of these lineages showed patterns of incomplete lineage sorting and recombination as has been observed among other closely-related taxa  <cit>  and was hinted at in previous phylogenetic studies of alternaria <cit> . lineage sorting, recombination, and horizontal transfer  <cit>  make phylogenetic analyses and species delimitation among small-spored alternaria challenging  <cit> . in contrast to previous studies that described ten morphospecies causing alternaria brown spot of citrus  <cit>  we identified one or two species among three phylogenetic lineages using the “minimize deep coalescence”  and hierarchical bayesian model approaches, respectively. both methods failed to differentiate the citrus  <dig> and  <dig> lineages but the hierarchical bayesian model method differentiated the citrus  <dig> lineage from citrus  <dig> and  <dig>  species boundaries between the morphospecies a. citriarbusti  and a. dumosa, a. turkisafria, a. perangusta and a. interrupta  were poorly supported by both methods. however, the gcpsr and *beast analyses separated the morphospecies a. tangelonis and a. colombiana  from citrus  <dig> and  <dig>  the hypothesis that all host-specific toxin producing, small-spored alternaria taxa infecting citrus as well as other hosts such as strawberry, japanese pear, apple, and tomato represent sub-specific variants or “pathotypes” of a. alternata is not new  <cit> . one of our analyses supported this hypothesis and all other analyses conclusively demonstrated that the number of taxa causing brown spot disease of citrus has been over-estimated using morphological criteria. further study is required to determine if the citrus  <dig> lineage represents a distinct species, and if so, what these two species should be named.

evolution of the citrus pathogens
alternaria alternata is an interesting model with which to study speciation in putatively asexual taxa. asexual taxa do not easily fit within species concepts developed for sexual taxa  <cit> ). in addition to being a well-recognized saprotroph, a. alternata infects a wide range of hosts, including citrus, pear, strawberry, and apple  <cit> . pathogenic forms of a. alternata are thought to have radiated from a recent common saprophytic ancestor through the horizontal acquisition of pathogenicity factors  <cit> . isolates sampled for this study are considered representative of the “tangerine pathotype”  <cit>  and these fungi produce host-specific act-toxins that are required for pathogenicity  <cit> . act-toxins are structurally similar to the host-specific toxins produced by strawberry pathotype  and japanese pear pathotype isolates   <cit>  and the genes controlling the biosynthesis of these toxins are homologous  <cit>  connecting the three citrus lineages to the lineages of strawberry and japanese pear pathotype isolates in future studies will allow polarization of the phylogeny of host-specific toxin-producing alternaria and facilitate studies of toxin gene evolution and the evolution of pathogenicity. assuming that the mutation rate for the endopg gene is similar to other protein coding genes at approximately  <dig>  × 10− <dig> to  <dig>  × 10− <dig> mutations per site per year  <cit>  the estimated time of divergence of the citrus  <dig> lineage and the citrus  <dig> and  <dig> lineages is at least  <dig>   <dig> years before present, and probably occurred much earlier. this date suggests that divergence of citrus  <dig> occurred long before the movement of citrus, and presumably its pathogens, from its putative center of origin in southeastern asia less than  <dig> years ago  <cit> . to date, only citrus  <dig> isolates have been isolated from north and south america, whereas the other lineages are found on several old and new world continents. this suggests that independent introductions of each lineage may have occurred in different locations, presumably with the host.

using gcpsr criteria, many cryptic species have been identified, including several plant pathogenic fungi  <cit> , human-infecting fungi  <cit> , and an insect pathogen  <cit> . latin names have been assigned to some of these cryptic species  <cit> . as far as we are aware, this is the first report that compares the gcpsr method to other newly developed tree species estimation methods. our results suggest that in the presence of divergent evolutionary histories, gcpsr will likely overestimate the number of species. although no reports could be found comparing the gcpsr method with others, several studies have compared species tree estimates generated with *beast and/or mdc to concatenated results. it is now well-documented that concatenated data can produce well-supported phylogenies that are inconsistent with the true species tree  <cit> . furthermore, belfiore et al.  <cit>  developed species trees using concatenation and best  for pocket gophers of the genus thomomys and found that the concatenated tree estimated from seven loci was over-resolved whereas fewer species were supported in the phylogeny estimated using best  <cit> . this result is similar to what we observed in this study with a. alternata. further, eckert and carstens  <cit>  tested the accuracy of concatenation and mdc generated species trees using simulated datasets in the presence of gene flow. as the level of gene flow increased the probability of identifying the true species using concatenation dropped to zero, although this value only decreased to 74% using mdc  <cit> . we found similar results, with the *beast and concatenated trees having similar topologies, but with node support varying widely. our results suggest that species tree estimation methods that account for gene tree uncertainty among loci with diverged histories, with signals of lineage sorting and recombination may result in fewer well-supported species than concatenation, especially among closely related fungal taxa.

two of the loci we employed in this study  revealed strong evidence for a history of recombination. asexual alternaria species are thought to be derived from sexual ancestors  <cit> , as has been suggested for other asexual ascomycetes  <cit> , and one species a. infectoria has been connected to a lewia teleomorph  <cit> . although time scales for our ancestral recombination graphs  are not possible, the arg for flank-f <dig> showed three possible recombination events where citrus  <dig> haplotypes are possibly derived from citrus lineages  <dig> and  <dig>  it is difficult to date these putative recombination events and to know if these events are the result of historic or current sexual or asexual recombination. signatures of recombination were found in the citrus  <dig> lineage in an alternaria brown spot fungus population in florida  <cit>  but the mechanism of this recombination is not known. alternaria may be able to recombine through parasexual and/or sexual means  <cit> , which concurs with the findings that mating type genes in a. alternata are expressed  <cit>  and under strong purifying selection  <cit> . further studies will be needed to determine if alternaria alternata sensu lato is capable of forming a sexual stage than has heretofore been overlooked. if so, results from our arg may represent contemporary rather than historical recombination, although dating recombination events in the arg is not possible.

CONCLUSIONS
species delimitation is important for the study of the evolution of pathogenicity and the emergence of infectious diseases. further, the delimitation of species also plays a critical role in global biosecurity by providing guidelines for restrictions on the movement of plant pathogens among countries which has national and international significance  <cit> . the threat of movement of introduced pathogens around the world has resulted in the quarantine of many crops or the rejection of exported crops. incorrectly naming a new species or wrongly identifying a species can result in significant economic losses  <cit> . in 2001– <dig>  shipments of li ya pear imported from china were rejected because of signs of alternaria spp. infection, which also occurred in australia, new zealand, and united kingdom. two related species, a. alternata and a. gaisen, were included in a pest risk assessment and further research showed that isolates sampled from li ya pear were morphologically distinct and given a new name, a. yaliinficiens <cit> . our results indicate that citrus brown spot is caused by a maximum of two species of alternaria, and that taxonomic revision of alternaria infecting citrus, based on congruent morphological and genetic analyses, is needed. one of these species  is found worldwide but the second  species has only been found in the americas. it is not yet known if phenotypic differences in aggressiveness, host range, or growth rates exist between these species, but if so, limiting the movement of the citrus  <dig> species into new countries might be warranted. this study highlights the need for the use of these new methods to accurately identify closely related, morphologically indistinguishable species that are important in agriculture and potentially of regulatory interest.
