BACKGROUND
a protein fold is often defined by the number, direction in space and connectivity  of its secondary structural elements <cit>  . in two major fold databases, the definition of a fold is itself partially ambiguous. in scop <cit> , the definition is "same major number and direction of secondary structures with a same connectivity", without quantification of the term "major". in cath <cit> , it is "overall shape and connectivity of the secondary structures", without a precise definition of "shape", although there is a degree of quantitation in this case since a structure comparison score is used to cluster domains in the same fold family. these "soft" definitions are required by the observed variations in the structures between proteins of identical biochemical function as amino acid sequence identities fall below 40% <cit> .

the situation is complicated by the presence of domains in protein structures. their identification and delineation are not straightforward. nevertheless, to have a better understanding of the effect of discrete classification as a description of the fold space, we analyzed the scop domain classification using two structure comparison methods applied directly to these domains. numerous structure comparison methods exist  <cit>  and some of them have been used to conduct such analyses. shapiro & brutlag <cit> , ye & godzik <cit>  and kolodni et al <cit>  used the receiver operating characteristic  curve <cit>  and sierk & pearson <cit>  a variant of it, mainly to compare their own method with other methods, using scop or cath as the gold standard. getz et al <cit>  devised an optimization algorithm to automatically classify new domains into existing scop folds or cath topologies. they did not use the roc curve, and only present the pairwise similarity score matrix. they also noted the existence of folds which are in twilight zone and difficult to classify. hadley & jones <cit>  and day et al <cit>  compared  <dig> classifications: scop, cath and fssp ranging from completely manual to entirely automatic. they give the coverage, i.e. the percentage of pairs that are common between the  <dig> classifications, the percentages of pairs that are common to all  <dig> methods. hadley and jones <cit>  in their analysis briefly described a few examples of structural discrepancies between the automatic method fssp and the manual and semi-manual scop and cath classifications.

here we use two structure comparison methods which are based on different principles and with which we are familiar. one, vast <cit> , is based on only secondary structure elements in its first stage of comparison while the other, sheba <cit> , uses the amino acid sequence along with other structural properties of each residue in its initial step. we first construct the roc curves using the scop fold definitions. we then generate the confusion matrix that results after setting a score cutoff value determined from the roc curves. we analyze various aspects of this matrix to understand and extract the main properties of the fold space which cause the divergence with the automatic similarity assignment and the manual scop classification. although some of the previous works <cit>  cover portions of what we describe here, none, as exhaustively analyzes and lists the fundamental mechanisms that produce the observed divergences.

RESULTS
roc curves
the roc curves of each method show that both vast and sheba are generally successful in detecting when two domains are in the same scop fold . the roc auc  is  <dig>  for sheba, and  <dig>  for vast, indicating that sheba recognizes scop folds slightly better than does vast. also, the sheba roc curve is above the vast roc curve at every point; there are no points of crossing, indicating that sheba is uniformly better than vast at this recognition task. the roc curve we present is actually an average of the curves obtained for each individual scop fold-recognition problem using a common cutoff value for all problems. for certain individual problems, vast may dominate sheba or vice versa.

an optimal cutoff value for the binary decision of similarity can be determined from the roc curve either by specifying the desired fpr  or by specifying the desired tpr . to reach a 1% fpr, the corresponding cutoff value is  <dig>  for pcli and  <dig>  for zscore , with corresponding tpr values of  <dig> % and  <dig> % for vast and sheba, respectively.

confusion matrix heat maps
neither the vast nor the sheba heat map is strictly symmetric ; the computed similarity measure depends on which domain is used as query and which as target. sheba gives a substantially more asymmetric heat map than vast. out of the total of m* =  <dig> , <dig> domain pairs  on which the heat map is based, vast and sheba have  <dig>  and  <dig>  asymmetric pairs, respectively. a domain pair similarity score is considered asymmetric if its similarity score exceeds the cutoff value in one comparison, but does not when the query and target structures are exchanged.

vast uses an heuristic algorithm to find the maximal clique so the comparison of domain a with b may not select the same clique as the comparison of b with a when there are several near maximal cliques. the result is a slight asymmetry in the pcli score. the more noticeable asymmetry manifest by sheba is due to the zscore computation which uses the average and the standard deviation of the distribution of m-scores between a fixed query domain and all other domains in the database, making the m-score distribution dependent on which domain, a or b, is declared the query domain. since the average m-score similarity of a query domain a to the database may depend on parts of a which are not matched to b, the average similarity of b to the database might be quite different. hence the zscore becomes asymmetric.

false negatives
the true positive rate varies with fold class, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  scop similarity detection differs widely among folds within a class and between the two methods. we now seek explanations of this variation.

about 40% of the folds  achieve a fold specific true positive rate  above  <dig>  for both methods. all classes are nearly proportionally represented in this set. for the exhaustive list of tpri obtained by each scop fold with vast and sheba, .

to investigate why some domain pairs in the same scop fold are not detected as similar, we look at such domain pairs that belong to the same scop fold and for which the pcli and zscore values are below  <dig> and  <dig> , respectively. these low cutoff values correspond to a fpr of 5%, and are chosen to exclude from consideration any borderline cases with computed similarity near but just below the original cutoffs. for all classes a to g, a total of  <dig> folds contain such extreme false negative domain pairs with  <dig> in a,  <dig> in b,  <dig> in c,  <dig> in d,  <dig> in e,  <dig> in f and  <dig> in g. the complete list of these folds is provided in table  <dig> 

detailed analysis of these false negative pairs highlights some common factors which explain the varying success of automated methods in detecting the similarity among domains in a scop fold. most of the false negatives can be explained by structural variation within a fold and to a lesser extend by structures made of repeating units.

structural variation of the common core
in many cases, the structure of the common core <cit>  of a fold varies significantly from one domain to the next in the same scop fold. we observe this phenomenon in folds across all scop classes. many of the extreme false negative domain pairs described above are examples of such cases. figure  <dig> shows the three domains, d1c5ch <dig> , d1akjd_ , and d1pama <dig> , from fold b. <dig>  the similarity for pairs  and  is detected by both vast and sheba, while it is not for the pair . the relative orientations between the beta sheets which form the beta sandwich, in domains  and  vary from those in domain . this variation is important enough, with regard to thresholds admissible by vast and sheba, to make superposition of the structures  and  difficult, and to prevent a similarity detection. this results in a loss of transitivity for automatic similarity detection.

structures made of repeating units
automated similarity detection methods do not necessarily consider two structures similar if they contain the same simple structural motif but with a different number of repeats. the scop fold a. <dig> provides an extreme example. it is defined by domains that are comprised of repeated occurrences of a helix-loop-helix motif <cit> . the number of occurrences of the helix-loop-helix motif varies greatly and is unspecified by the fold definition. figure  <dig> shows three members in this fold and gives their pairwise similarity scores assigned by sheba and vast. the d1qbkq_  domain contains many repeats and is much larger  than d1a17_  and d1ku1a_  domains . since both vast and sheba look for global similarity, and since d1a17_ or d1kula_ would match at best only a small part of d1qbkq_, they yield the low pcli and zscore values. size difference does not account for the low score between domains d1a17_ and d1ku1a_. here, the reasons are that the helices of the repeated motifs vary in length and that the relative orientation of each motif varies between the structures. thus, a multiple occurrence of locally similar motifs between two domains does not always produce a high global similarity score.

decoration of the common core by many secondary structure elements
occasionally two proteins in the same scop fold share a common core but are different in overall shape. an extreme example is shown in figure  <dig> for the domain pair d1e9ga_ and d1enfa <dig> in the fold b. <dig>  they both contain a beta barrel, but the beta barrel in domain d1e9ga_ is only a small part of its entire structure. a match between this domain and domain d1enfa <dig>  based on the conserved common core is thus not found sufficient to consider them to be similar by the automatic pair-wise structure comparison methods.

miscellaneous cases
some folds, such as fold d. <dig> or a. <dig>  are described in scop as including a variety of structures. we also note the existence of several ambiguous fold definitions leading necessarily to a low tpri. for instance, fold c. <dig> whose scop description is " <dig> layers: alpha/beta/alpha, parallel or mixed beta-sheets of variable sizes", can probably be split into at least  <dig> folds. we also spotted what appears to be a bookkeeping error by scop. domains d1kkea <dig> and d1qiua <dig> of fold b. <dig> were not found to be similar either by vast or sheba. the protein 1kke has two domains, which belong to two different folds. the n-terminal domain  forms an extended structure belonging to the scop fold b. <dig> . the c-terminal domain  forms a beta barrel belonging to the scop fold b. <dig> . in scop and in the astral database, the domain d1kkea <dig>  which consists of the residues 250– <dig>  is placed in the b. <dig> fold and d1kkea <dig>  which consists of residues 313– <dig>  is placed in the b. <dig> fold.

differences between vast and sheba
there are  <dig> folds with a tpri below  <dig>  by vast yet above  <dig>  by sheba. they are a. <dig>  a. <dig>  a. <dig>  a. <dig>  a. <dig>  a. <dig>  a. <dig>  a. <dig>  a. <dig>  b. <dig>  c. <dig>  d. <dig>  d. <dig>  d. <dig>  d. <dig>  d. <dig>  d. <dig>  f. <dig>  f. <dig>  f. <dig>  g. <dig>  g. <dig>  g. <dig>  g. <dig>  g. <dig>  g. <dig>  g. <dig>  these are mainly small folds with only  <dig> domains each. no fold has been identified with a tpri less than  <dig>  by sheba but above  <dig>  by vast. additionally, the class specific true positive rates reported in figure  <dig>  shows an important difference between vast and sheba in the a class .

some of the differences observed between vast and sheba are related to the calculation of the scoring function in vast , and to the fact that structures sharing fewer than  <dig> secondary structure elements  are often judged not significant by vast. this latter factor also affects true positive rates computed by vast in the a class, where the tpri averages only  <dig>  for folds with  <dig>  or  <dig> sses, but rises to  <dig>  when the fold has about  <dig> or more sses . but at least one case could not be explained by the issue of the pcli calculation. domains d1h8pa <dig>  d1l6ja <dig>  d1pmla_, d2hpqp_and d2pf1_ <dig>  of fold g. <dig> defined as a disulphide-rich fold, scored low in vast similarity but surprisingly high by sheba. these domains have particularly small sses, distributed sparsely over the backbone of the structure. it is quite understandable that vast which relies on the sses, finds low similarity among them. it was also observed that pairs for which sheba zscore was high also had a higher level of sequence homology than those for which the sheba zscore was low . this indicates that sheba benefited by using the sequence homology in finding the initial alignment .

false positives
the off-diagonal pixels in the heat maps, on figure  <dig>  represent fold pairs having a non-zero fold-specific false positive rate fpri,j. the confusion made by each method has different characteristics, shown by the difference in the distribution of the dark areas. there are a relatively small number of pixels between classes. in contrast, confusion within each class varies with the method and can be high.

the main confusion is within classes b, c and d, with respectively  <dig> folds out of  <dig> within b class,  <dig> folds out of  <dig> within class c, and  <dig> folds out of  <dig> within class d, involved in some type of confusion. vast does not show a noticeable level of confusion within classes a, and f, although sheba does. the relatively high a-class confusion level for sheba is probably related to its use of the dynamic programming algorithm, without gap penalty, in finding the best alignment between a pair of superimposed structures <cit> .

besides these global observations, more specific confusion trends can be determined by analyzing the predominant confusion patterns shown by the heat maps.

intraclass confusion
confused folds occur mainly near the diagonal of the sorted heat map, as a result of the hierarchal clustering and re-ordering of the folds within each fold class .

confused folds in the a class include helix bundles of either identical or a similar number of helices in similar relative orientations. examples are reported in table  <dig>  rows  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the close similarity of some domain pairs, for example d1m7ka_ and d1hs7a_ belonging to folds a. <dig> and a. <dig>  respectively, indicates that these "confusions" appear to be cases wherein scop includes considerations other than purely structural similarity/dissimilarity.

the next cluster of five folds in figure  <dig> , includes all beta sandwich immunoglobulin-like folds, with  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> strands in  <dig> sheets with a greek-key topology. their confusion is caused by the sharing of the motif of the beta sandwich of the common core. others confused sets of folds in the b class also involve mainly beta sandwich folds , or beta barrel folds . the confusion among domains of these clusters of folds is similarly caused by a common beta sandwich or beta barrel motif. in the b class, where folds defined by the beta barrel or the beta sandwich motifs are frequent, confusion among folds of either motif is frequent as well.

a large common confusion pattern among folds appears at the bottom right corner of the c class area of the heat map . a highly confused set, table  <dig> row  <dig>  from this large confused area consists of  <dig> layer alpha/beta/alpha folds with parallel beta sheets for some, and mixed beta sheets for other, and with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> strands. the superposition of the domains d1a8p_ <dig>  and d1a9xa <dig> , from folds c. <dig> and c. <dig> respectively , illustrates that confusion is caused by the presence of a common sub-structure. examination of other confused folds from this large confused set within the c class in table  <dig>  rows  <dig>  and  <dig>  shows that they also involve 3-layer alpha/beta/alpha folds that share sub-structures of varying sizes that are similar. the large number of confusions in the c class can be attributed to the abundance of the 3-layer alpha/beta/alpha folding pattern, which get confused by a similar mechanism.

the c class also shows some small confused sets among folds with different architectures. for example, confused folds c. <dig> and c. <dig>  correspond respectively to tim beta-alpha barrel and variants having  <dig> strands or less. confused folds c. <dig> and c. <dig>  are described respectively as " <dig> layers: beta/beta/alpha; the central sheet is parallel, and the other one is anti-parallel" and "core:  <dig> layers, alpha/beta/alpha; parallel beta-sheet of  <dig> strands". the confusion occurs due to a common beta/alpha sub-structure.

we have noticed confusions involving distinct motifs such as between the beta sandwich fold b. <dig> and beta barrel fold b. <dig>  . beta sandwich and beta barrel motif folds are generally well separated, but false positives due to proximity of some extreme members of these respective folds can happen. figure  <dig> reports a false positive between domains from the beta sandwich fold b. <dig> and beta barrel folds b. <dig>  which are well distinguished on average. domain d1pama <dig>  from fold b. <dig> is confused with domain d1ep3b <dig>  from fold b. <dig>  such confusion is caused by structural variation of the common core of the beta sandwich fold b. <dig> and barrel fold b. <dig> represented by prototypical domains d1tvda_  and d1d2ea <dig> , respectively. deformation causes the relative orientation between the beta sheets of domain  to become more similar to that of the barrel domain .

interclass confusion
finally, the heat maps also show off-diagonal grey or black pixels where members of a scop fold in one class are detected as similar to domains in another. both heat maps present such confusion patterns. as apparent in figure  <dig>  the confusion between classes is very low for both methods. nevertheless, it is still detectable between some classes, in particular, between classes b and d, c and d, c and e, and between d and g. for vast, there is no additional noticeable confusion between classes. however sheba shows additional minor confusion of the class a with the classes b, c, d, f, and g, and between classes d and f.

the confusions involving the e-class  are easily understandable. they all involve structures which contain a domain which shares similarity with another domain in a different class, mainly class c. examples include fold e. <dig> confused with c. <dig>  c. <dig>  c. <dig>  c. <dig> and c. <dig>  , and fold e. <dig> confused with folds c. <dig>  c. <dig>  c. <dig>  c. <dig>  c. <dig> and c. <dig>  .

additionally, sheba confuses some folds from class a, with folds in classes d and f . the most confused folds from the a and d classes, having more than  <dig> confused domain pairs, are: , , , , , . for confused folds a. <dig> and d. <dig>  for example, even though vast and sheba match a similar number of residues, the sheba zscore tends to be high while the vast pcli is below the cutoff value. a similar trend is observed between the a and f classes. the way the zscore is computed has the tendency to increase the confusion, by over-emphasizing the significance of the match, compared to the number of matched residues when helices are matched.

discussion
the combined use of the roc curve and the confusion matrix heat map has been the key in making this large scale analysis of protein classification. several authors <cit>  have used the roc curve to evaluate structure comparison methods using the cath or scop protein classification database as the reference. in the most recent and comprehensive study, kolodny et al <cit>  compared six different methods and found the highest true positive rate to be 50%, at 1% false positive rate, attained by the dali method using the native dali score and cath as the reference. our roc analysis finds a true positive rate of  <dig> % and  <dig> % at 1% false positive rate, for the comparisons of vast and sheba to scop, respectively. the differences between their result and ours might be explained by differences between the comparison methods , by differences between the definitions used for the false and true positive rates , and/or by the use of different databases of protein structures . in particular, cath groups domains into different numbers of folds than does scop, as noted by hadley & jones <cit>  and day et al <cit> .

aside from providing a global measure of the agreement, roc curves are also useful because they provide a practical means to select a score cutoff value for deciding if a pair of structures is to be considered similar or not, by trading off true and false positive rates. other approaches have used methods other than roc analysis or have ignored that tradeoff entirely. in their comparison of several structure comparison methods with cath, sierk and pearson <cit>  selected a decision level corresponding to the first  <dig> errors made by the program. other approaches  <cit>  do not use the roc curve and often fail to properly acknowledge the obligatory trade off between false and true positive rates, making it difficult to compare the reported degree of agreement with others.

although the roc auc varies somewhat by method, none of the reported values are high as desired. this raises a fundamental and important question: what mechanisms cause the automatic structural comparison methods to diverge so significantly from scop or cath? to address this aspect of the problem, we need to descend from a global view of the database to a more detailed view of individual folds and finally of the domains comprising each fold. to investigate why structural comparison methods diverge from scop, we used the confusion matrix to distribute the 1% false positive comparisons to the individual fold pairs, resulting in a "false and true positive rates" map of the protein fold space. this can be distinguished from the map of the fold space constructed by hou et al. <cit>  who applied multi-dimensional scaling to pair-wise similarity scores. the exploration of the fold space, guided by our map, leads directly and objectively to the areas or subsets of folds where divergence with structural comparison methods is most evident. in particular, it has allowed us to move from the areas of high false positive or negative rates to the corresponding properties of the fold space. false negative rates are seen to relate directly to the issues of core variation and repeated sub-structures within a fold, while false positive rates are linked to the sharing of a common sub-structure between folds. since the mathematical quantities fpr and tpr are interdependent, so are the corresponding properties of the folds space.

in looking at a particular area of our heat map, we can calculate an index of how likely a method is to confuse those folds, as the ratio of the average of fold-specific false positive rates to the average fold-specific true positive rate in that area. a value near  <dig> indicates that the folds in this area cannot be distinguished by the structure comparison method, on the average. it is worth noting that this index is cutoff dependent, as expressed in terms of true and false positive rates, and can thus be obtained for more or less severe false positive rates. the index of confusion is related but distinct from the index of "gregariousness" in harrison et al. <cit>  for the cath folds , which is a property of a fold that measures the number of other folds that are similar to it as judged by comparing the score to that of an empirically established standard score distribution at a certain cutoff level. the substantial number of highly confused sets of folds listed in table  <dig> allows us to examine in detail the source of the discrepancy between scop and our structure comparison methods.

causes of false negatives and false positives
in the results section we presented several examples of false negative and false positive cases related in one way or another to the common core. scop defines the common core of domains in the same fold to have the "same secondary structure elements in the same arrangement with the same topological connections" , leaving open the possibility for some variation such as differences in length, relative orientations and/or number of the sses which we call variation of the common core.

variation of the common core of domains within a fold, considered insignificant by scop, may still be large enough to cause vast and sheba to find the domains dissimilar, giving rise to false negatives as in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  false negatives may also occur when the common core is so small compared to the whole structure that the overall structural similarity is unrecognizable, as in figure  <dig>  the evidence of structural variations of the common core of proteins within the same fold was shown in the work by chothia & lesk <cit> . when the percentage of sequence identity between domains decreases much below 40%, their common cores tend to diverge structurally. the analysis of the confusion matrix shows that some false negatives for folds reported in table  <dig> arise from such core structure variations.

when two domains share an apparent common core, but scop judges the core elements to be significantly different, scop places the domains in distinct folds. however, the automatic methods may find the domains similar, as in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  giving rise to false positives. also, conversely to the case in figure  <dig>  when the repeats of a common motif are organized in a regular fashion in a domain, our methods may consider the domains similar, but scop may place them in distinct folds . table  <dig> enumerates a number of false positive cases arising from closely related common cores in distinct scop folds.

vast and sheba decide on the similarity on the basis of the largest fraction of matching secondary structural elements or residues. however, visual inspection may allow the overall context of the matching and mismatching parts to play a role. if only a small part matches, but the matching part appears to be the core of each structure, then the match may appear more meaningful. if the number of repeats in a structure appears to be an important property of the structure, structures with different numbers of repeats may be placed in different folds. if, on the other hand, the precise number of repeats is not important for a structure, structures with different numbers of repeats are all placed in the same fold. if almost all parts match, but some important part, perhaps one critical beta-strand or even an irregular loop, is missing or placed differently in one structure, it may be placed in a different fold, etc.

it is possible that the problem is rooted in part, in the way structural alignment is currently conceived. analogous to sequence alignment methodology, structural alignment maximizes the match between two structures, at the residue or secondary structure level, to infer a similarity relationship. on the other hand, the concept of similarity implicitly defined by scop, is focused on the sharing of higher level  motifs. this is in contrast to similarity measures based on the residue or sse-level matches as defined by many structure comparison methods. we have shown examples  where occurrence of a motif is more appropriate for inferring similarity than is the maximum residue or sse-level structural match. although not evaluated directly here, we suspect that the structural comparison methods agree with scop when these two concepts agree, i.e. when the motif in question coincides with the maximum residue or sse-level structural match, but disagree otherwise. automatic structural similarity measures might thus be improved either by incorporating higher level structural motifs such as barrels or sheets, rather than remaining at the level of residues, strands or helices, or by weighting matching residues according to their structural context or functional importance.

problems encountered by structural comparison methods might also be a reflection of intrinsic properties of the protein fold space. we have reported examples which tend to support the idea of structural drift  <cit> , i.e. a series of gradual steps which connect one fold with another, and showed areas where folds were highly confused. in such sets of folds, some structures within the same fold are too dissimilar to be detectable by structural comparison methods, while those in different folds are not always completely distinct. this raises questions about the fold definition. we have observed, for example, that distinction between beta barrel and two layer beta-sandwich domains can be surprisingly difficult. as the relative orientations of the strands in the two beta sheets in a barrel departs from orthogonality, and become more parallel, the distinction between barrel and two layer beta sandwich motifs becomes fuzzy. drawing the proper separations within a set of domains in which such phenomenon is observed is not obvious and necessarily introduces some arbitrariness. should such diverse folds be sub-divided into two, three or more folds? if this decision is taken at some point in time, with the then available structures, how stable and universal will this distinction remain over time? vast and sheba are generally well able to a major part reproduce the fold classification of scop, consistent with the notion that protein folds are well-defined, discrete entities. however, despite many attempts, scop folds or cath topologies continue to elude precise quantitative or computational definition. we suggest therefore, that for some parts of the fold space, folds are not well separated entities but more nearly a continuum of structural arrangements as also observed in  <cit> , with some regions more populous than others. here, apparent "folds" may arise as much from density fluctuations in regions where experimentally determined structures are sparse, as from thermodynamic stability wells which would partition the fold space. we speculate that the idea of continuum will become more apparent as a larger number of new structures are solved by structural genomics projects <cit> . in any case, the classification of structures into folds is probably a valuable and practical way of describing the fold space. when the fold space is continuous, this necessitates some arbitrary classification decisions, which may in fact not be completely reproducible by any automated approach.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this comprehensive comparison of vast and sheba with the scop classification demonstrate that these two methods in their present form can reproduce at best 75% of the scop fold classification . our detailed study of over  <dig> million pairs of protein domains underlines the difficulties encountered by automatic methods analyzing a classification of protein structures. a major difficulty arises from structural variation, which naturally accompanies amino acid sequence divergence, within the core of a defined fold. when severe enough, this can produce false negatives. when common cores of different folds are too similar, false positives result. another, though less common, difficulty also arises when a motif is repeated several times within a single domain and in variable numbers. when the defining "common core" corresponds to only a small part of a whole structure, when the core is decorated extensively, automatic recognition of its similarity to other fold members becomes difficult. these divergences suggest a continuous rather than a discrete protein fold space, further complicating the problem of automatic classification. clearly, improved algorithms of comparison must be developed and/or other types of classifications must be considered, and will be considered in future work.
