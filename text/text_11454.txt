BACKGROUND
rna editing is a post-transcriptional modification process which not only expands the number of functions encoded by our genomes but also provides additional mechanisms of gene regulation. the most predominant form of such editing in higher eukaryotes is adenosine-to-inosine  rna editing, which is catalyzed by members of adar enzyme family   <cit> . the resulting inosines preferentially base pair with cytidines  and are therefore functionally guanosines , although there has been evidence that inosine can also pair with guanosine  <cit> . thus, a-to-i editing can have profound effects on downstream rna processing and function, including recoding of open reading frames, altering the pattern of alternative splicing, interfering with microrna function, modulating rnai activity, and playing other roles in gene regulation  <cit> .

the pattern of a-to-i rna editing, either site-specific or promiscuous, is likely to determine the fate of an edited rna molecule. the majority of a-to-i editing in the human transcriptome is located within inverted-repeated alu elements  positioned within introns and utrs as revealed by the systematic comparison of cdna or est libraries to genomic sequences  <cit> , and by genome-wide profiling of transcriptomes and genomic dnas from the same individuals  <cit> . rnas with extensively edited iralus within their 3′utrs are retained in nuclear paraspeckles  <cit> , although this retention is not always complete  <cit> . compared to promiscuous a-to-i rna editing in repetitive elements, site-specific editing in coding regions provides a rich source of genetic recoding that can influence protein function. the best-characterized editing sites in mammals occur in codons of pre-mrnas encoding glutamate receptor b  and serotonin receptor 2c   <cit> . in addition, site-specific a-to-i rna editing outside coding sequences has been shown to interfere with mirna pathways by affecting microprocessor or dicer cleavage, risc loading and mature mirna function  <cit> . thus, it is becoming increasingly apparent that a-to-i rna editing plays important roles in regulating gene expression and product function.

inosine base pairs with cytidine during reverse transcription and therefore appears as g during sequencing of cdna. thus, a-to-i editing sites can be inferred by the presence of g at a given position in a cdna sequence but only a in the corresponding genomic position  <cit> . most recently, the application of next-generation sequencing to cdnas  and genomic dnas from the same human individual followed by extensive computational analyses revealed an additional large number of editing sites in both alu and non-alu elements  <cit> . thus, the emergence of new technologies and approaches has enabled the identification of a growing list of editing sites.

transcriptome and genomic dna sequencing datasets are not always available for single individuals. however, rna-seq data is widespread and available through public datasets and thus represents a relevantly rich source of yet unexplored rna editing sites. there are two features that currently limit the application of rna-seq data to identify a-to-i rna editing without the relevant genomic information. on one hand, the nature of nucleotide mismatches reduces the ability to uniquely align rna-seq reads to the genome, and therefore reduces the capability to retrieve nucleotide variants. on the other hand, true editing events are often hidden in a background noise caused by sequence errors, mapping errors and genome variations, including genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms  and somatic mutations. thus, it has been challenging to accurately identify editing candidates from transcriptomes in the absence of gdna information.

to overcome the aforementioned issues, we have developed a new pipeline to accurately predict editing sites from  <dig> human rna-seq datasets, even without knowledge of relevant genomic sequences from which the rna-seq data were derived. we identified  <dig>  constitutive a-to-i editing sites that occur in clusters . some of these are enriched in non-repetitive elements and exhibit an extremely high a-to-i conversion frequency. importantly, editing sites located in non-repetitive editing boxes were validated in multiple human cell lines using conventional pcr and sanger sequencing and were proven to be catalyzed by adar <dig>  finally, distinct editing ratios of rna sites in editing boxes from different tissues/cell lines clearly suggest a spatial and dynamic regulation of a-to-i rna editing across human tissues.

RESULTS
a computational flow to predict clustered a-to-i editing sites from transcriptomes only
it has been challenging to discover a-to-i rna editing sites from rna-seq datasets for a number of reasons. first, edited as are interpreted as gs in sequencing reads. this leads to problems with alignment of edited reads to the genome. second, random sequencing errors and mapping errors are often problematic. third, some genomic polymorphisms and somatic mutations are unpredictable from an individual genome without knowledge of the genomic sequence. finally, transcriptome and genomic dna sequencing datasets are not always available for single individuals. to overcome these difficulties, we have developed a computational approach consisting of four key steps  to identify rna editing from multiple rna-seq datasets in the absence of the relevant genomic sequence.

step 1: a two-round unique mapping strategy with bowtie to improve the mapping ability and to obtain an increased number of aligned mismatches. multiple mapping pipelines have been developed to align individual rna-seq reads to the corresponding genomes  <cit> . however, most mappers with default setting are not suitable to deal effectively with mismatches that result from rna editing. to increase the mapping sensitivity to capture more mismatches, we applied a two-round-unique mapping with bowtie to analyze  <dig> human cell line and tissue transcriptomes . as we found that both ends of sequence reads contain higher sequencing errors , we trimmed 75-nt reads from both ends to 70-nt long for the first alignment. this mapping scheme allowed us to not only keep longer reads to map repetitive elements in the genome, but also retrieved a large number of mismatches. for instance, the second split-alignment resulted in only 1-4% of increased mapped reads compared with first alignments ; however, the mapped mismatches were increased 20%-30% in different samples . in addition, the application of this two-round mapping strategy with other aligners also dramatically increased the mismatch calling, but with a little increase in mapped reads . clearly, this two-round-unique mapping scheme significantly improved the alignment capability for mismatches, which in turn allowed us to obtain an accurate dataset of the editing site/ratio prediction and to identify previously unreported a-to-i conversions in human transcriptomes.

step 2: a series of stringent cutoffs to reduce sequencing/mapping errors and to remove known genomic snps. as different samples vary in genome coverage and sequencing depth, we used the hpb value  to normalize the expression level for each transcribed site across samples, and selected a relatively higher cutoff at hpb >  <dig> for a given site, comparable to rpkm/fpkm >  <dig> for a gene, to call potential editing candidates in highly expressed sites. in our calculation,  <dig> hpb represented 8 ~  <dig> raw hits for each base in different transcriptomes . the relatively high hpb in our analysis allowed us not only to locate the position of an editing site, but also to accurately calculate the editing ratio of each site.

step 3: a new parameter, pss, to remove unreported genomic variances by taking advantage of large numbers of rna-seq datasets. psss for known snps were calculated using a similar strategy and their distribution was then plotted as a control . from our analysis, 30% to 70% of mismatches carrying an overall pss from − <dig> to  <dig> are known snps , suggesting that the remaining mismatches carrying an overall pss from − <dig> to  <dig> could be unreported genomic variations. importantly, 100%  randomly picked mismatches with a pss from − <dig>  - <dig>  or − <dig> were proven to be true genomic variations, but not editing events, by sanger sequencing . on the other hand, only less than 5% of mismatches carrying an overall pss from  <dig> to  <dig> are known snps, suggesting that we could remove over 95% of reported and unreported genomic variations with a pss ≥ <dig> . however, given the fact that there are a large amount of known gsnps carrying pss at − <dig> to  <dig> , in the current analysis, we set up a even more stringent cutoff to remove potential genomic variation sites with pss <  <dig>  which filtered out over 97% expressed snps . from the data we noted that some well-characterized editing sites were found in a tissue-specific manner. for example, q/r and r/g sites in the pre-mrna of glur-b were detected only in brain with the expected editing frequencies . these tissue-specific editing events were largely due to the brain-specific expression of glur-b rnas . in the current study, we focus on editing sites constitutively detected from multiple human tissues , and tissue-specific expressed rnas and editing events  were not considered.

step 4: predicting constitutive a-to-i editing sites that occur in clusters. owing to the absence of relative genomic sequence information with which to compare rna sequence data, we enriched high confidence a-to-i editing sites by considering the fact that a-to-i sites could be clustered or promiscuously edited within specific genomic regions. in our analysis, we found that many a-to-g/t-to-c sites, but few from other types of nucleotide conversions or known snps, could be clustered . in addition, we further performed strand specific rna-seq with rnas collected from h <dig> cells and found that 100% of the identified t-to-c sites were transcribed from “-” strand of chromosome and a-to-g sites were from “+” strand of chromosome in h <dig> cells, suggesting clustered a-to-g/t-to-c mismatches were most likely to be true a-to-i editing. as they were detected from no less than three transcriptomes, we classified these a-to-g/t-to-c mismatches after step  <dig> as constitutive a-to-i sites, and named regions containing such sites as “editing boxes”.

since it is known that a-to-i editing sites are enriched in alu elements, we calculated the enrichment of a-to-i conversion in alu elements after each step of our computational flow. as shown in table 1a, ~ 60% mismatches in alu elements were a-to-g/t-to-c conversions after step  <dig>  compared to ~ 24% before step  <dig> . furthermore, ~ 83% mismatches in alu elements were a-to-g/t-to-c conversions after pss cutoff, indicating pss could greatly improve the identification of true editing sites. finally, 100% mismatches identified in alu elements were a-to-is after the cluster filtering, while several regions clustered with other types of nucleotide conversions failed to be validated with sanger sequencing .

in total, we identified  <dig> constitutive a-to-i editing sites clustered in  <dig> editing boxes . although the editing boxes were largely from alu elements, we found  <dig> editing boxes from non-alu repetitive regions and  <dig> editing boxes from non-repetitive regions . the average length of non-repetitive editing boxes is  <dig> nt, which is shorter than that of alu and non-alu repetitive editing boxes . however, the average a-to-i nucleotide conversion rate in non-repetitive editing boxes is about 51% of all as, which is higher than alu and non-alu repetitive editing boxes , suggesting the surprising result that promiscuous a-to-i editing can occur in non-repetitive regions.

characterization of predicted constitutive a-to-i sites in editing boxes
unlike tissue-specific editing, all  <dig>  a-to-i sites in editing boxes identified in this study were constitutive editing sites that existed in multiple tissues/cell lines. these editing sites are all located in noncoding regions, with the majority in noncoding exons and intergenic regions and ~10% in introns . compared with several other recent studies  <cit>  and darned database ,  <dig> editing sites  were reported in at least one dataset and  <dig>  were novel sites . more interestingly,  <dig> reported editing sites were found in only one of the six datasets, and only one site was present in all six datasets . the huge difference among these datasets could be due to a variety of cells/tissues used in individual studies as well as different computational approaches in acquiring editing sites. these comparisons also suggested that our computational flow allowed us to efficiently predict a-to-i editing sites across transcriptomes even without the support of relevant genomic information.

we further examined genomic locations of  <dig> new editing sites in editing boxes. these new sites are located in noncoding regions, including noncoding exons, intergenic regions and introns . in addition, many editing sites in intergenic regions were located within 10 kb of annotated genes, suggesting these unannotated regions could be extended 3′-utrs of adjacent genes. although editing box sites were largely from alu elements,  <dig> and  <dig> editing box sites were from non-alu repetitive or non-repetitive regions, respectively . additional analyses revealed that the majority of these editing boxes were located in or close to iralus  , suggesting promiscuous editing in non-alu editing boxes could be facilitated by the recruitment of adar enzymes to nearby duplex structures. however,  <dig> new editing sites in non-repetitive regions  were further than 1 kb from the nearest iralus , suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved in these promiscuous editing events.

predicted constitutive a-to-i sites from non-repetitive editing boxes are catalyzed by adar1
it is known that the majority of a-to-i editing in the human transcriptome occurs within alu elements  <cit> ; however, it was unexpected to identify promiscuous editing sites in non-repetitive sequences. thus, we randomly selected several such editing boxes for validation.

in an intergenic region between genes ccdc <dig> and eif2ak <dig> in chromosome  <dig>  two non-repetitive editing boxes  and one alu editing box  are separated by over 1 kb. we found that this intergenic region is differentially expressed in all examined cell lines/tissues . we further checked epigenetic modifications of chip-seq analysis from encode project, but these showed no signs of active transcription starts adjacent to this region, suggesting this intergenic region is more likely co-expressed with its neighboring gene. more careful analysis revealed that similar expression signals were detected in the intergenic region with eif2ak <dig>  and stopped at a reported  poly site in h <dig> cells, suggesting this intergenic region is an extended 3′ utr of eif2ak <dig>  this was further confirmed by strand specific rna-seq in h <dig> cells.

the validation results from gdnas and cdnas of both h <dig> and hela cells for the two editing boxes from non-repetitive regions revealed a high correlation with our bioinformatic predictions. sites predicted to be edited in h <dig> and/or hela cells  with over 10% editing ratios were validated by sanger sequences . in addition, the estimated editing ratios by the two methods correlate relatively well , as indicated by additional file 9d. taken together, these results suggested that our predicted editing sites in editing boxes are highly confident. moreover, knockdown of adar <dig>  significantly reduced editing ratio of individual a-to-i sites in editing boxes , suggesting that editing in non-repetitive editing boxes is catalyzed by adar <dig> 

predicted editing ratios of nine a-to-i sites in editing box at chr2:  <dig> , <dig> - <dig> , <dig> are listed in all examined cell lines/tissues. blank indicates either no editing or failure of passing our stringent cutoffs . five annotated sites were reported from different datasets/analyses. adataset of rna editing at http://darned.ucc.ie/.

since the filtering applied in this study achieved high accuracy  in predicting clustered a-to-i editing sites, we also investigated the performance of this method on editing sites that are not clustered . however, only about half of randomly selected predicted sites could be experimentally validated in both h <dig> and hela cells . this further indicated that our method is more reliable for prediction of clustered a-to-i editing sites than for non-clustered ones in the absence of the relevant genomic sequences.

characterization of promiscuous a-to-i rna editing from non-repetitive editing boxes
since this work is the first demonstration of promiscuous editing in non-repetitive regions catalyzed by adar <dig> , we further characterized these sites in greater detail. although there were no consensus sequences in all non-repetitive editing boxes, we found that adar <dig> preferentially targets adenosines when the 5′ nearest neighbor is a ≈ u > c > g . this is in the agreement with known neighbor preferences of adar <dig> enzyme, but is slightly different from recently refined predicting sites of adar editing for an ~800 bp dsrna   <cit> . moreover, structure prediction revealed that some of such editing boxes could potentially form long dsrna duplexes with adjacent sequences , suggesting the promiscuous a-to-i rna editing in non-repetitive editing boxes may involve a mechanism similar to that of iralus. however, since over 90% of these editing boxes were located in or close to iralus, we could not exclude the possibility that their editing is coupled to the recruitment of adar enzymes to nearby alu-related duplex structures  <cit> .

to further test this possibility, we cloned sequences of editing boxes in 3′utr of egfp or in the upstream region of single alu or iralus in 3′utr of egfp . we have previously shown that iralus, but not single alus, can be extensively edited when expressed from plasmid vectors, even during transient transfection  <cit> . we reasoned that if the adjacent iralus recruit adars to the nearby editing boxes, we would find more editing sites in editing boxes in vector containing iralus than those containing single alu or no alu. otherwise, if editing boxes alone are sufficient to recruit adars, we would observe promiscuous editing in all examined vectors. strikingly, our analyses revealed that sequences in editing boxes in all examined vectors were extensively edited in a similar way as that observed in their endogenous loci . these results demonstrated that non-repetitive editing boxes alone can be edited by adar <dig>  independent of adjacent iralus.

constitutive a-to-i sites in editing boxes are highly dynamic across human tissues
as  <dig>  constitutive a-to-i sites could be found in multiple human tissues and cell lines, we were able to analyze the spatial and dynamic regulation of a-to-i rna editing. surprisingly, constitutive a-to-i sites in editing boxes are highly dynamic across human tissues at two levels. on one hand, individual sites exhibit distinct patterns of editing across human tissues and cell lines . on the other hand, the editing efficiency of closely located editing boxes is highly dynamic. interestingly, non-repetitive editing boxes  exhibited even more striking differences than editing boxes of iralus  among examined samples. this indicated that different mechanisms could facilitate promiscuous editing within the same genomic characteristics in different tissues/cell lines and that adar editing is affected by more than nearest neighbors and local rna structures .

taken together, we have developed an approach to quantitatively profile constitutive a-to-i rna editing from multiple human transcriptomes in the absence of the relevant genomic information. the application of our approach has allowed us to identify a large number of clustered constitutive a-to-i sites, including  <dig> novel sites. our analysis also revealed that non-repetitive editing boxes could be promiscuously edited by adar <dig>  independent of their adjacent iralus. finally, although functionally unknown, marked differences of editing ratios in the same sites identified in editing boxes clearly suggest a spatial and dynamic regulation of a-to-i rna editing across human tissues.

discussion
rna-seq datasets, widespread through currently available public databases, are rich sources to search for a-to-i rna editing sites. however, rna-dna mismatches between rna-seq reads and the genome make the alignment of nucleotide variations to the genome problematic. in addition, transcriptome and genomic dna sequencing datasets are not always available for single individuals, thus making straightforward prediction of a-to-i editing sites from available transcriptomes even more challenging. in this study, we developed a new computational approach to predict rna editing from multiple tissues in the absence of the genome information. an additional  <dig> novel a-to-i editing sites have been identified compared to several other recent studies  <cit>  and darned database . we expect to detect more constitutive a-to-i rna editing sites with additional sets of human transcriptomes as inputs by obtaining a higher pss value for each a-to-g mismatch site. in addition, discrepancies of reported editing sites could be due to a variety of cell lines/tissues used in different studies   <cit> .

very recently, ramaswami et al. also reported the identification of edited sites from transcriptome data only  <cit> . their method was reported earlier  <cit>  and slightly modified for identifying rna editing sites in the absence of the related genomic dna sequencing datasets  <cit> . in our present study, the pipeline was designed to identify clustered and constitutively edited a-to-is. in total,  <dig>  such editing sites were identified, including  <dig> new ones. strikingly, these new sites were still largely missed by ramaswami et al.  <cit>  although much larger datasets were used. for example, they identified  <dig> out of  <dig> from  <dig> human lymphoblastoid cell lines,  <dig> out of  <dig> from  <dig> human brain samples, and  <dig> out of  <dig> from the same  <dig> human tissue samples.

since we focused on clustered a-to-is which are constitutive edited in at least three human tissues/transcriptomes, limited editing sites were identified in this study. it is also noteworthy that some limitations exist in this approach, including the insufficiency to predict more restricted tissue-specific editing, the inadequacy to identify some true editing sites with 40-60% or >95% editing ratios, and inaccuracies in identifying non-clustered editing sites . for instance, true editing sites, such as a-to-i sites in pre-mrnas of glur-b, were not addressed in our study. in addition, true editing sites with low expression or low editing ratios could have been missed due to stringent cutoffs in the computational flow. these true editing sites would be captured if multiple rna-seq datasets from the same tissue  and higher depths of rna-seq datasets from individual samples were included in the future analysis. while a few non a-to-gs  sites might be expected, none could be validated as true editing sites. these noncanonical sites could be derived mostly from mis-mapping reads to a highly similar genomic duplicate region, as suggested by piskol et al.  <cit> . in the future, more stringent filters are needed for rna editing prediction to remove this type of mapping errors.

strikingly, we found that promiscuous rna editing is not restricted to transcribed inversely orientated repetitive elements, such as iralus. our analysis revealed many predicted constitutive a-to-i editing sites that appeared in clusters and were enriched in non-repetitive editing boxes with an extremely high a-to-i conversion frequency . a recent study suggested that editing of non-alu sites appeared to be dependent on nearby edited alu sites, likely by the recruitment of adar enzymes to nearby duplex structures  <cit> . however, we demonstrated that editing boxes alone were sufficient to be edited promiscuously by adar <dig> in expression vectors, and adjacent iralus have little effect to facilitate more editing . although we could identify no consensus sequences in non-repetitive editing boxes, they are likely to form dsrnas and the edited sites have similar 5′ neighbor preferences as reported recently for other adar <dig> substrates  <cit> . thus, these new substrates predicted in this study further expanded our knowledge of the catalytic pattern of a-to-i rna editing by adar <dig> 

methods
rna-seq datasets
rna-seq datasets from  <dig> human tissues sequenced by illumina hiseq  <dig>  and two additional cell lines sequenced by illumina genome analyzer iix   <cit>  were retrieved from gene expression omnibus . about 40 ~  <dig> million 75-nt single reads from each poly + rna-seq sample were obtained and further trimmed to 70-nt long at both 5′ and 3′ ends for  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt, respectively to reduce high sequencing errors at read ends .

customized mapping strategy 
a two-round-unique mapping strategy with bowtie  <cit> , soap  <cit> , or bwa  <cit>  was applied to retrieve an increased number of mismatch calling . first bowtie  mapping was performed from 70-bp reads to the hg <dig> human genome/junction  <cit>  with up to three mismatches. after removal of multiple-aligned reads, unmapped 70-bp reads were split into two 35-nt fragments. 35-nt fragments from 5′ and 3′ were sequentially applied for the second unique mapping with up to three mismatches. the mapped 35-nt fragments were then extended to the other half with no more than  <dig> mismatches in total. in addition, reads with a distribution bias of mismatches that indicate higher sequencing errors at read ends are also excluded in this analysis. other aligners  can certainly be used for analysis directly with high mismatch allowance, but new parameters are needed to avoid/remove sequencing and mapping errors. the split scheme allowed us to retrieve more mismatches , and improved our capability in identifying the clustered rna editing sites .

removal of sequencing errors and annotated gsnps 
as the strand information of these rna-seq datasets was not available, we referred plus strand of  chromosomes as reference for mismatch calling. in addition to trim 75-nt reads from both ends to 70-nt, we carried out the following stringent criteria for mismatch calling: : each mismatch site must have a hits per billion-mapped-bases  >  <dig>  since multiple rna-seq datasets with different sequencing depths were used in this study, we developed hpb to normalize the expression level for each base across samples, and selected a hpb >  <dig> for each mismatch site  to focus on highly expressed mismatches. : to improve the predicted editing accuracy and reduce false positives, we used mismatch ratio > 5% as a cutoff. mismatch ratios were calculated by using mismatched hits vs all hits on the same sites. for example, g: > 5% for a-to-g mismatch in a corresponding genomic position as a, and etc. : to reduce random sequencing errors and to improve the correct assignment of sequence reads, we used effective signal > 95% as a cutoff. for example g: > 95% for a-to-g mismatch, and etc. : require at least two individual reads with the same type of nucleotide conversion. : we finally filtered out gsnps from the common snp database  and  <dig> genome database .

removal of unannotated gsnps by customized pss 
pss was set up to further reduce unknown genomic noise by taking advantage of multiple human tissue rna-seq datasets. notably, most mismatches showed low ratios  from multiple human tissues, while some showed high mismatch ratios  . in contrast, mismatch ratios of known gsnps were significantly enriched in two peaks: one major peak at around 100%  and a minor peak at around 50%  mismatch ratio . theoretically, genomic variations would give rise to either ~ 50% or ~ 100% mismatch ratios depending on whether the variation is heterozygous  or homozygous   <cit> . for a given unknown mismatch site existing in multiple tissues, a pss was given to test its probability for either a genome variation  or an editing  in each sample . to optimize parameters for pss cutoff by considering both efficiency of gsnps removal and the number of nucleotide variants remained after the removal, we permuted all possible combinations among 40% ~ 60% and 90% ~ 100%. the combination of 40% ~ 60% and ≥ 95% in current analysis is among the best parameter for our purpose . a final overall pss for each mismatch site was obtained by adding up psss from multiple tissues and cell lines. psss for known snps were calculated with a similar strategy and their distribution was then plotted against pss from − <dig> to  <dig>  with cutoff at pes <  <dig>  over  <dig> % expressed snps were filtered out.

identification of constitutive a-to-i sites in editing box regions 
mismatch sites were selected using the following criteria:  predicted editing sites were constitutively transcribed at least from three human tissues/cell lines;  each site is no longer than 50 bp away from the nearest site and the minimum transcribed genomic region is 20 bp long;  each site has a greater than 20% mismatch rate in at least one tissue;  at least  <dig> mismatch sites clustered in one region with at least 20% conversion rate for each type of nucleotide. thus, we named these regions containing promiscuous edited a-to-i sites as “editing boxes”.

characterization of constitutive a-to-i sites in editing boxes
previously identified editing sites were retrieved from the rna editing database  and different studies  <cit>  for comparison. refseq genes and annotated intron/exon boundaries were retrieved from from ucsc . alu and non-alu repetitive elements were retrieved from http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg19/database/rmsk.txt.gz. iralus were defined as any two or more inversely oriented alu elements located within two kilobases in their genomic location  <cit> .

analyses of neighbor preferences and rna secondary structure
neighbor preferences were calculated based on predicted constitutive editing sites in non-repetitive or non-alu repetitive regions, by extending  <dig> bases in both upstream and downstream flanking regions. the neighbor preferences were drawn by software weblogo  <cit> . the structure of adjacent two editing boxes at chr <dig> was predicted by rnafold from viennarna package  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

cell culture, plasmid construction and transfection, knockdown of adar <dig>  and western blots
hela cells were cultured using standard protocol provided by atcc. human embryonic stem cells  were maintained as described before  <cit> . sequences of editing box region  were cloned into the pegfp series vectors  <cit>  and each plasmid was transfected into hela cells for 24 hours prior to harvest total rnas for editing analysis. sense and antisense oligonucleotides were designed based on a human adar <dig> targeting sequence   <cit>  and a control scramble sequence   <cit>  and cloned into plvthm vector. lentivirus particles were produced in hek-293ft cells with the co-transfection of packaging vectors pspax <dig> and pmd <dig> g. for infection, hela cells were incubated with concentrated viral particles at 37°c overnight and the medium was changed to fresh the next day. infected hela cells were collected 72 hours later for western blots with goat anti-adar <dig> .

total rna isolation, rt-pcr, and sanger sequencing validation
total rnas from hela, adar <dig> knockdown hela cells, transfected hela cells, and h <dig> cells were extracted with trizol reagent  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. after treatment with dnase i , the cdna was transcribed with superscript ii  with oligo  or random hexamer. genomic dnas were purified from both cell lines by tianamp genomic dna kit . pcr products from cdnas and gdnas were amplified with primers , and predicted a-to-i editing sites were validated in available cell lines with the conventional sanger sequencing. editing ratios of validated a-to-i sites by sanger sequencing were calculated by “imagej” . briefly, the areas of edited and unedited signals, indicated as the signal intensities at each site, were carefully selected and measured by “imagej”. the editing ratio was then calculated by dividing edited intensity with total intensity at the same site. correlation of editing ratios calculated from sanger sequencing and rna-seq were determined by scatter plot.

stranded rna-seq analysis
strand-specific rna-seq libraries were prepared with prereleased directional mrna-seq library kits  with minor modifications. briefly, after enriched by oligo-dt selection, poly + rnas were fragmented, and treated with phosphatase and polynucleotide kinase to repair the ends. rna adapters were sequentially ligated to the 3′ and 5′ ends of rna fragments and reverse transcribed using a primer complementary to the 3′ linker. cdna library was then amplified and sequenced on hiseq <dig> with 1x <dig> bp reads. the sequence file can be accessed from the ncbi sequence read archive by geo accession number gse <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we present an integrative approach to quantitatively profile constitutive a-to-i rna editing from multiple human transcriptomes in the absence of the relevant genomic information. the application of our approach has allowed us to identify a large number of clustered constitutive a-to-i sites, including  <dig> novel ones. we further demonstrated that non-repetitive editing boxes could be promiscuously edited by adar <dig>  independent of their adjacent iralus. strikingly, clear differences of editing levels in the same editing box sites but from different tissues/cell-lines were also observed, strongly indicating a spatial and dynamic regulation of a-to-i rna editing across human tissues. our work thus offers new insights into the catalytic pattern and complex regulation of a-to-i editing by adar <dig>

validation of predicted a-to-i editing sites in other editing boxes. predicted a-to-i editing sites were highlighted in red  or black . predicted editing ratios were shown above each site in the cdna sequencing chromatograms. validation of some a-to-i editing sites from editing boxes at  chr2:  <dig> ,644- <dig> ,685;  chr12:  <dig> ,506- <dig> ,558;  chr14:  <dig> ,376- <dig> , <dig>  editing ratios in chr12:  <dig> , <dig>  were underestimated in our analysis compared with conventional sanger sequencing, probably due to more mismatches in short fragments failed to map to reference genome. note that predicted sites with low editing ratio were difficult to be validated due to the limited sensitivity of the sanger method.  scatter plot of editing ratios for  <dig> a-to-i editing events  identified by rna-seq and sanger sequencing method. data points corresponding to false positive or false negative predictions were shown with red dots. r, r squares and p value for the linear regression  indicated the relatively good correlation between these two methods.
