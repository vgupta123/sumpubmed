BACKGROUND
recently, the combination of gene expression profiling and classic quantitative trait locus  mapping has emerged as an important tool in dissecting the genetic basis of gene expression variation  <cit> . using transcript levels as surrogates for higher order quantitative traits enables a finer scale resolution of the underlying molecular basis of complex phenotypes. gene expression traits can also be integrated with network inference methods to reconstruct genetic pathways and metabolic networks from genetic perturbation data  <cit> . the first expression qtl  study was performed in offspring derived from a cross between two divergent strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . linkage analyses revealed thousands of eqtls, acting both in cis and trans, with most trans-linkages being due to a few regulatory "hotspots".

current statistical methods that analyze high-dimensional phenotypes, such as expression traits, one trait at a time suffer from low power because of the challenges associated with multiple hypothesis testing. in addition, such approaches fail to take advantage of the potentially informative correlation structure of high-dimensional phenotypes. in order to exploit the correlation structure among genes, various data reduction techniques can be used to reduce the overall dimensionality of the data. for example, in the context of eqtl studies, hierarchical clustering has been performed followed by linkage mapping of the average expression of cluster members  <cit> . such an approach is constrained by the size and number of clusters and the clustering algorithm. a more unbiased data driven feature selection can be used to overcome both the sparse sampling problem and multiple testing issue.

singular value decomposition  and independent component analysis  are popular dimension reduction techniques with different operating characteristics. briefly, svd is a factorization method that decomposes the data into a set of mutually orthogonal "eigentraits" that are sorted according to variance explained  <cit> . ica decomposes the expression data into a set of statistically independent modes that we term as "icatraits". the statistical independence between modes is estimated by optimizing a contrast function, such as kurtosis or mutual information  <cit> . unlike svd, ica components might differ based on the contrast function and number of underlying sources, which under a generative model is responsible for the variation in the data. we will refer to eigentraits and icatraits as "meta-traits", both of which are built from the linear combinations of the original set of expression traits. by analyzing only the most relevant meta-traits it is possible to capture major biological trends while potentially averaging out the gene-specific noise  <cit> . we used both ica and svd approaches as they capture different sources of variation. the more widely used method of svd makes the implicit assumption of underlying gaussian sources when maximizing the variance explained by the uncorrelated features. if this assumption is not valid, then the orthogonal dimensions may be combinations of two or more distinct biological signals  <cit> . ica is more sensitive to sources that exert independent influence on the data and is ideal for detecting mixtures of higher order statistics. it has been applied, to a wide variety of problems such as face recognition  <cit> , image analysis algorithms  <cit> , and for pathway enrichment in breast cancer data  <cit> .

both svd and ica have been previously applied to gene expression data  <cit> . svd based methods like principal components analysis  have found applications in studying oscillation profiles from genome-wide expression measurements  <cit> , inferring network connectivity from expression data  <cit> , and tissue sample classification  <cit>  while ica has been used for pattern recognition in tumor microarray data  <cit> , to discover functional modules in microarrays  <cit>  and in other more general signal processing applications  <cit> . pca has also been explored in the context of qtl mapping. however, these mapping methods have been applied to small subsets of genes or a limited number of quantitative traits  <cit> , but not to eqtl data.

in this study, svd and ica were applied to a well studied eqtl data set in yeast. the resulting meta-traits, which are mutually uncorrelated, can be thought to represent independent trends in expression variation  <cit> . we used the top  <dig> ranked svd and ica meta-traits to map eqtls. we identified  <dig> eqtls,  <dig> of which have not been previously described. finally, we discuss the performance of both svd and ica with respect to capturing patterns in expression variation and linkage mapping.

RESULTS
single trait analysis
we used data previously described by brem et al  <cit>  who measured gene expression levels of  <dig> orfs in  <dig> segregants derived from a cross between the saccharomyces cerevisiae strains by and rm. the expression level of each gene was treated as a quantitative trait  and eqtl were identified by linkage analysis using  <dig> genetic markers distributed across the genome.

our goal was to investigate the use of data reduction techniques for mapping eqtl and to compare it with traditional single trait analyses. to this end, we first performed a genome-wide linkage analysis on each of the  <dig> gene expression traits by standard regression techniques  <cit> . each trait was tested for linkage at all  <dig> markers, which amounts to approximately  <dig> million hypothesis tests. significant linkages were detected for  <dig> traits at a false discovery rate  of  <dig>    <cit> . loci with widespread genetic effects were identified by dividing the genome into non-overlapping  <dig> kb bins and counting the number of linkages in each interval . sixty percent of all linkages fell in  <dig> bins that had more than  <dig> linkages. with more segregants compared to a previous study  <cit> , we identify a larger set of gene expression traits that link to each of the previously described eqtl hotspots . the linkage hotspots derived from single trait analyses are summarized in table  <dig>  and provide the necessary baseline to compare the eqtl analyses based on meta-traits too.

eqtl positions of the  <dig> traits for which linkage was detected at an fdr cutoff of  <dig> , were binned into  <dig> kb bins and the chromosomal coordinates of each linkage hotspots that have more eqtls than expected by chance, the number of traits linking to the hotspot , the number of those traits that have the over-represented go attribute , the total number of traits that have this attribute  and over-represented go annotation terms are reported.

dimension reduction using svd and ica
svd analysis was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the data from the original  <dig> expression traits to  <dig> eigentraits, where each eigentrait is a linear combination of all gene expression traits. the proportion of variance explained for each eigentrait relative to total variation in the data set is shown in figure  <dig>  eigentraits that explained more variation than expected by chance were identified by comparing with a null-dataset , and in total, the top  <dig> eigentraits, which collectively account for approximately 72% of all variation, were selected for further study.

independent modes from an ica based decomposition were sorted by the liebermeister criterion  <cit>  . to enable comparison between the trends in variation captured by the two different methods we selected the top  <dig> icatraits consistent with the  <dig> significant eigentraits that were analyzed.

as each meta-trait is a linear combination of all  <dig> gene expression traits, it would be informative to infer the set of specific genes that make the largest contribution to each one. to identify these genes, we calculated the correlation between each of the  <dig> gene expression traits with each meta-trait and determined significantly correlated genes by permutations . as shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the number of significantly correlated  gene expression traits range from  <dig> to  <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig>  for each eigentrait and icatrait, respectively.

for each eigentrait, we report the number and position of any significant linkages detected, the number of traits that are significantly correlated with a specific eigentrait , the number of correlated traits that have the over-represented go attribute , the total number of traits that have this attribute  and also the over-represented go annotation term. two of the twenty have no correlated traits that can be called significant while six showed no significant over-representation of any biological function and remaining twelve show over-representation of certain biological functions that are consistent with previously reported trends of large scale expression variation like the mating locus, auxotrophic markers and stress response among others. novel eqtls detected for eigentraits  <dig> and  <dig> are described in more detail in the text.

for each icatrait, we report the number and position of any significant linkages detected, the number of traits that are significantly correlated with a specific icatrait , the number of correlated traits that have the over-represented go attribute , the total number of traits that have this attribute  and also the over-represented go annotation term. three of the  <dig> show no over-representation of biological functions while for remaining  <dig> both previously described and novel go categories with associated eqtl were detected. analysis of icatrait  <dig> and  <dig> are described in more detail in the text.

to identify general biological themes, we performed a gene ontology  analysis for each set of significantly correlated expression traits across the top  <dig> meta-traits . for  <dig> of the  <dig> eigentraits, the significantly correlated genes show an overrepresentation of go terms related to specific biological processes such as budding, amino acid, sterol and carbohydrate metabolism, and ribosome biogenesis, which is generally consistent with previous analyses  <cit> . similar enrichment of go terms were found for  <dig> out of  <dig> icatraits, with additional categories such as retro-transposon, alcohol dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase activity being detected . in addition to the enriched set of traits with common biological process that have been described in earlier eqtl studies, we identified four novel group of traits that have not been identified through linkage analysis to date. two of them, eigentraits  <dig> and  <dig>  are defined by clusters of genes with similar function and will be described in more detail below. the other two, icatraits  <dig> and  <dig>  are associated with retro-transposon activity and alcohol dehydrogenase activity, respectively.

linkage analysis of meta-traits
for the top  <dig> meta-traits, we performed a genome-wide linkage analysis using  <dig> genetic markers that were genotyped in each segregrant. linkage analysis was performed by regressing marker genotypes on trait values for each meta-trait and significance was determined by permutations. we considered markers to be significant according to a permutation based genome-wide error rate of 5% as significant  <cit> . the genome-wide linkage analyses for each eigentrait and icatrait is shown in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig>  respectively. in total,  <dig> eigentraits demonstrate significant linkage to one or more places in the genome resulting in a total of  <dig> unique eqtl. eigentraits  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> each link to  <dig> eqtl while eigentrait  <dig> links to three eqtls. similar analysis of the icatraits resulted in  <dig> unique eqtls being detected  that were distributed over  <dig> icatraits. icatraits  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed linkages to two eqtls while icatrait  <dig> linked to four eqtls. at a genome-wide error rate of  <dig> %, we expect two false positive among the total of  <dig> eqtl deemed significant.

ten of  <dig> unique eqtls identified map to previously described regions of trans-regulatory hotspots  <cit>  that regulate groups of genes with shared biological functions such as amino acid catabolism , mating , mitochondria , and heme/fatty acid metabolism . for each of these meta-trait, we observed a corresponding enrichment of related go terms in the set of correlated traits .

the genome-wide linkage results of meta-traits derived from svd and ica show considerable overlap . overlapping eqtls primarily correspond to loci that exert widespread expression variation and include eqtls with strong trans-acting effects, which is consistent with the fact that both svd and ica were able to capture the major sources of variation by its top ranked components. of the eleven new eqtl, four showed evidence for cis-linkage, which will be discussed in more detail below. the other linkages map to regions in the genome that either show no significant enrichment of linkages from the single trait analysis or there is no obvious gene to explain the enrichment of go annotation for that meta-trait.

analysis of putative cis-acting meta-trait linkages
in traditional linkage scans where traits are analyzed one at a time, a cis-linkage is characterized as an expression trait showing linkage to its own genomic location. in the setting of meta-trait linkage scans, we define a cis-linkage of a meta-trait as linkage to the genomic position of a trait that is also significantly correlated with this meta-trait. in the following sections we describe in depth analyses of four novel cis-linkages that were not described in previous eqtl studies. these include eigentraits  <dig> and  <dig>  and icatraits  <dig> and  <dig>  which show significant enrichment of go annotation terms.

cis-regulation of asparaginase metabolism
eigentrait  <dig> has a strong cis-linkage on chromosome  <dig> . the region harbors genes involved in the catabolism of asparaginase during nitrogen starvation . there are  <dig> expression traits that are significantly correlated with this eigentrait  and the top four correlated genes make up the tandem array of asparaginase  genes. the nine remaining significantly correlated genes are strong candidates for participating in the asparaginase metabolism network. comparative sequence analysis with the published draft rm genome sequence  <cit>  revealed the absence of the asp gene cluster in the rm strain, which is consistent with the eqtl being supported by the highest f-statistic among all linkages and the small number of genes that are principal contributors to this particular eigentrait.

cis-regulation of sodium transport
eigentrait  <dig> also shows evidence of cis-linkage on chromosome  <dig>  this eigentrait is enriched for genes involved in sodium transport. genes with the highest correlation to eigentrait  <dig> are the group of ena genes ena <dig>  ena <dig> and ena <dig>  which are members of the sodium efflux atpase family and span the chromosome  <dig> region that surrounds the linked eqtl . sequence analysis of the rm draft genome for the ena group of genes shows alignment hits to a single copy of the ena gene on supercontig  <dig>  which suggests that copies of the ena genes have been deleted along the rm lineage as one would expect an alignment to all three copies otherwise. this observation is consistent with the hypothesis of possible copy number changes existing at this locus between the two strains. however, the draft status of the genome precludes a more definite inference of copy number change.

cis-regulation of retrotransposon activity
sixty-three genes are significantly correlated with icatrait  <dig>  and one significant eqtl was mapped on chromosome  <dig> . as the go analysis of the  <dig> genes shows, a large proportion of these genes are transposable elements and/or involved in the process of retro-transposition. the multipoint linkage profile of the eqtl on chromosome  <dig> shows the location of a subset of genes that lie in the  <dig> lod support interval . the gene yercty1- <dig>  a retrotransposon of the ty <dig> family, is present in the eqtl support interval and also is significantly correlated with icatrait  <dig>  this supports the hypothesis that yercty1- <dig> is a possible candidate gene underlying this eqtl.

further analysis of the sequence data was performed using the published rm draft sequence. the alignment of the gene as well as part of its upstream and downstream genomic sequence in the two strains points to a possible insertion-deletion polymorphism spanning the whole retro-transposon. a caveat for this observation is a possible alignment error, which might result due to the high degree of homology within different transposable element families and the unassembled state of the rm genome. this does not rule out the presence of a polymorphism underlying the eqtl, but makes detection using currently available sequence data more difficult.

cis-regulation of alcohol dehydrogenase activity
icatrait  <dig> is comprised of  <dig> significantly correlated genes that are enriched for alcohol dehydrogenase activity and fermentation. of the  <dig> genes, only yjl056c falls in the  <dig> lod support interval of the eqtl on chromosome  <dig> . yjl056c is a transcription factor that binds to zinc-responsive promoter elements to induce transcription in the presence of zinc. the other genes in the correlated set include the adh group of enzymes that are alcohol dehydrogenases involved in fermentation and the glycolytic pathway. the transcription of these genes is activated in times of zinc deficiency, which is also supported by the presence of zinc transporters like zrt <dig> and zrt <dig> in the set of correlated genes. these observations suggest that zap <dig> is a possible candidate gene underlying the eqtl. we performed multiple sequence alignment of the zap <dig> coding sequence from the two saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, by and rm as well as two related species saccharomyces mikatae and saccharomyces paradoxus. of the  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms that were found,  <dig> resulted in a non-synonymous change . these polymorphisms are strong candidates for further computational and functional analysis in order to narrow down the eqtl underlying icatrait  <dig> to the nucleotide level.

CONCLUSIONS
analyzing low dimensional representations of high-dimensional data through techniques such as svd and ica is a useful approach for studying the genetic architecture of gene expression variation  <cit> . we find that the meta-trait linkage analysis approach is complementary to traditional single trait linkage scans, which are inefficient in exploiting the complex correlation structure that exists among gene expression levels. in addition, this approach results in a smaller number of traits to analyze, thus increasing statistical power by attenuating the multiple testing problem.

randomizing parental yeast genomes through genetic crosses induces widespread changes in expression, which allows the contribution of genetic variation to gene expression changes, to be systematically probed and makes it an appealing situation to apply dimension reduction methods. by applying svd and ica to the unfiltered expression matrix, we are able to focus our analysis on the most biologically meaningful meta-traits that we term "eigentraits" and "icatraits", respectively. in this low dimensional snapshot, each meta-trait is uncorrelated with the others and is a weighted average of all the  <dig> traits and hence can be analyzed independently of others. the approach we outline for identifying significantly correlated genes for each meta-trait allows gene sets to be identified and subjected to further bioinformatics and functional analyses.

the complementary nature of this study compared to single trait analyses is supported by the fact that eigentraits with some of the highest singular values map to previously described strong effect eqtls such as leu <dig>  ura <dig>  mat locus, msn2/ <dig> targets, and amn <dig>  these results are also reinforced by the icatrait analysis that uncovered similar large effect qtls. furthermore, the utility of both approaches is demonstrated by the detection of eleven novel eqtls that supplements our understanding of the genetic architecture of gene expression differences between these two s. cerevisiae strains. these include four novel cis-linkages that were studied in greater detail. two of them map to tandem arrays of genes with similar functions that are involved in asparaginase metabolism and sodium ion transport. comparative sequence analysis of the by and rm strains sugests that these gene clusters have been lost in rm and is consistent with reports of copy number changes at these loci in non-laboratory yeast strains  <cit> . these two meta-traits also show differential expression between the two parental strains at the marker with the highest linkage statistic . this is interesting as the two strains have evolved in very different ecological niches and might depend on different nutrient sources for survival. using icatraits, two additional cis-linkages were identified and found to be associated with differences in retro-transposititon and alcohol dehydrogenase activity. analysis of the linkage region at a finer scale also provided strong candidate genes that might be potential regulators of these expression differences.

despite the strict genome-wide threshold that we used, there were four cases of eqtls common between eigentraits . such observations coupled with the orthogonal property of meta-traits is consistent with either pleiotropy or coordinate linkage between two closely spaced eqtls. however, it is important to note that such inferences are tenuous because a single biological signal may be captured by multiple eigentraits. this cannot be ruled out as the eigentraits, being linear combinations of all expression traits, are hard to interpret qualitatively. interestingly, there is only one case of linkages being shared between icatraits, suggesting that ica is better at discriminating between the different biological signals present in the data. furthermore, ica identified a larger set of novel eqtls compared to svd. this may be due to ica's estimation of statistically independent components in higher order moments that detects non-normally distributed trends, while svd relies on the absence of correlation in second order moments of normal trends. the non-normally distributed or long-tailed distribution in this dataset is expected based on the finding from single trait analyses that there exists a small number of linkage "hotspots" that are responsible for most of the variation in the dataset.

another scenario where the interpretation of the results might be potentially misleading is when the meta-traits capture technical artifacts in the microarray experiment, for example signal that is driven by cross-hybridization instead of true differential expression. one approach to assess the effect of cross-hybridization on the eqtl data is to test the hypothesis that paralogous genes are enriched among significantly correlated meta-traits. for example, eigentrait  <dig> consists of  <dig> significantly correlated traits, of which  <dig> are paralogs . thus cross-hybridization among these genes may be influencing this eigentrait. note, linkage analysis of eigentrait  <dig> identified two closely linked cis-eqtl on chromosome  <dig> . one of these cis-linked regions contains yrf1- <dig> and yrf1- <dig>  thus cross-hybridization of yrf1- <dig> and yrf1- <dig> with the other yrf <dig> paralogs could potentially explain this apparent cis-linkage. however, if this were true we would expect to see a cis-linkage at one of the other yrf <dig> genes, which we do not observe. therefore, the linkages observed for eigentrait  <dig> appear to be robust, but the larger issue of technical artifacts due to cross-hybridization and other sources is important to keep in mind when interpreting eqtl studies.

in summary, we highlight the applicability of dimension reduction methods for studying large-scale patterns of variation in gene expression traits. we argue for the use of both svd and ica if there are no prior expectations about the different patterns of variation present in genome-wide expression trait measurements. it also represents an important tool in recovering previously undetected eqtl, for exploring the widespread but uncharacterized cases of pleiotropy, and provides the basis for a more detailed understanding about how regulatory variation manifests itself across transcriptional networks.
