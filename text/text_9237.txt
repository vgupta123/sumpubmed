BACKGROUND
sterol carrier protein 2/3-oxoacyl-coa thiolase  belongs to a well-characterized scp- <dig> gene family  <cit> , whose members encode an intracellular non-specific lipid carrier protein. scp- <dig> is present in both vertebrates and invertebrates and is involved in intracellular sterol/lipid transfer processes, which affect biosynthesis and metabolism of fatty acids and sterols  <cit> . in insects, cholesterol is required for cellular membranes and ecdysteroid biosynthesis. insects utilize phytols, such as β-sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol, and synthesize ecdysteroids  in the prothoracic glands  <cit> . however, insects cannot synthesize cholesterol via de novo biosynthesis because they lack at least two key enzymes, squalene monooxygenase and lanosterol synthase, in their system  <cit> . therefore insects must obtain cholesterol or other sterols from their diet to fulfill their sterol requirements for normal growth, development and reproduction  <cit> . in humans  <cit> , mice  <cit> , rats  <cit>  and chickens  <cit> , a single scpx gene encodes a fusion protein containing 3-oxoacyl-coa thiolase  and scpx- <dig> domains, which are post-translationally cleaved into two separate proteins. the scpx-t protein functions as a 3-oxoacyl-coa thiolase in peroxisomal oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids  <cit> . the scp- <dig> protein is released from the peroxisomes into the cytoplasm and then translocated into the nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor  <cit> . this gene is also transcribed into a transcript that encodes only the scp- <dig> protein depending on alternative transcription initiation  <cit> . in invertebrates, members of the scp- <dig> gene family have been reported in many species. in caenorhabditis elegans, the genes encoding 3-oxoacyl-coa thiolase  and scp- <dig> protein are not fused together and the two proteins are encoded by separate genes, p <dig>  which is a thiolase-type protein homologous to the n-terminal protein scpx-t of the vertebrate scpx, and unc- <dig>  which is homologous to the c-terminal scpx- <dig> protein of the vertebrate scpx  <cit> . in aedes aegypti and drosophila melanogaster the scpx genes encode a scpx transcript of mrna that encodes both scpx-t and scpx- <dig> domains  <cit> , while there are separate genes producing other low-molecular-mass scp- <dig> proteins in a. aegypti  <cit> . in the lepidopteran insects bombyx mori and spodoptera littoralis, the scpx gene also encodes two fused scpx-t and scp- <dig> domains  <cit> .

scpx deletion mutant mice accumulated a derivative of the intermediate 24-keto-trihydroxy cholestanoic acid-coa , suggesting that the products of the scpx gene are responsible for the cleavage of 24-keto-thca-coa into choloyl-coa  <cit> . over-expression of scpx in mouse l-cells significantly altered cholesterol absorption and metabolism  <cit> . knocking down aescp- <dig> transcript decreased the accumulated level of cholesterol in the pupae and resulted in increased mortality of the mosquito a. aegypti adults, indicating that the aescp- <dig> gene is critical for adult development  <cit> . in transfected mouse l-cells scpx/scp- <dig> co-localized with catalase in peroxisomes, but significant amounts of scpx/scp- <dig> appeared to be extra-peroxisomal  <cit> . in both in vitro cultured cells and the larval midgut of a. aegypti, aescpx was present mostly in the peroxisomes, while aescp- <dig>  which is not transcribed from aescpx gene in a. aegypti cells  <cit> , was present in the cytosol, mitochondria and nuclei  <cit> . the difference in the subcellular distribution of scpx and scpx- <dig> suggests that these two proteins may play different and specific roles in cellular processes.

in the present study, cloning, characterization, cellular localization and functional analysis of a scpx cdna in spodoptera litura were described. slscpx is predominately expressed in the midgut during the larval feeding stage. knocking down slscpx transcripts in larvae and over-expressing slscpx and slscpx- <dig> in the spli- <dig> cell line altered the accumulation of cholesterol and adversely affected the larval to pupal transition. all of these results taken together suggest that the slscpx gene plays an important role in cholesterol uptake as well as growth and development of s. litura.

RESULTS
cloning and characterization of slscpx cdna sequence
a scpx cdna sequence was identified by randomly picking and sequencing cdna clones in an expression library constructed with mrna isolated from the midgut of 3-day-old 6th instar larvae of s. litura. this cdna  contained  <dig>  bp in length encoding an open reading frame  of 535-amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of  <dig> kda, which included two domains, one containing 390-amino acid residues with an estimated molecular mass of  <dig> kda at the n-terminal end and the other containing 145-amino acid residues with an estimated molecular mass of  <dig> kda at the c-terminal end . blast search in the genbank database indicated that the first domain was highly homologous to 3-oxoacyl-coa thiolase, while the second domain was highly homologous to scp- <dig> protein in other species. for the sake of convenience in this paper, the full-length protein is referred to as slscpx; the 3-oxoacyl-coa thiolase domain is referred to as slscpx-t; and the scp- <dig> domain is referred to as slscpx- <dig> . to confirm and obtain the slscpx full-length cdna directly from the s. litura midgut, reverse-transcription pcr  was performed using a pair of primers designed on the basis of the cloned slscpx cdna sequence  and mrna extracted from the midgut of 3-day-old 6th instar larvae. interestingly, two pcr products of approximately  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb were obtained . the results of sequencing and blast search indicated that they encoded a full-length scpx protein, which included both scpx-t and scpx- <dig> domains, and a scp- <dig> protein, respectively. sequence comparison of the slscpx cdna with the sequences of the two pcr products revealed that the pcr product scpx  was identical to the slscpx full-length cdna cloned from the screening of the library, while the scpx- <dig> cdna  was identical to the c-terminal slscpx- <dig> domain of the slscpx cdna, but lacked the n-terminal scpx-t sequence between the  <dig> and  <dig>  nucleotides of the sequence. similar results were observed for transcripts of scpx/ <dig> gene in b. mori, where two transcripts approximately  <dig> - and  <dig> -kb cdna products were amplified by rt-pcr  <cit> .

the deduced slscpx protein shared the same domain architecture as that of the vertebrate scpx: a thiolase  at the n-terminal region and a scpx- <dig> domain at the c-terminal region . the c-terminal regions of the slscpx protein and the slscpx- <dig> protein contained a peroxisomal-targeting signal ser-lys-leu. it is likely that slscpx and slscpx- <dig> proteins can be transported to peroxisomes where they perform their functions. a cysteine residue  , corresponding to the catalytically active cysteine in zoogloea ramigera 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolase  <cit> , was conserved in the slscpx protein.

blast search analysis indicated that slscpx protein was a member of the scp- <dig> gene family and highly similar to scpx in other species, such as scpx  of s. littoralis boisduval  <cit> , which is a geographically isolated allopatric species of s. litura fabricius , b. mori scpx   <cit> , a. aegypti scpx   <cit> , d. melanogaster scpx   <cit> , o. cuniculus scpx   <cit> , mus musculus scpx   <cit>  and homo sapiens scpx   <cit>  . this indicates that this gene is well-conserved during evolution and it may play a conserved functional role in growth and development of insects. although the lepidopteran scpx have higher identities to the dipteran scpx in regard to their amino acid sequence and they are clustered into an insect group, the lepidopteran scpx appeared to be orthologs of the vertebrate scpx .

in vitro expression of slscpx, slscpx-t, slscpx- <dig> recombinant proteins
in vitro expression of the slscpx , slscpx-t  and slscpx- <dig>  proteins respectively were achieved in a bacterial expression system and the recombinant his-tagged fusion proteins were purified using his-tag affinity columns . the resultant proteins had the identical molecular mass as predicted based on the deduced amino acid sequences. antibodies against these three peptides, respectively, were generated and could specifically recognize and distinguish the recombinant proteins from each other in western blotting analyses .

temporal and spatial expression of slscpx gene
when a dna fragment at the slscpx- <dig> domain region of the slscpx gene was used as a probe, three mrna transcripts  were detected in the midgut of different stages . they appeared to be the transcripts encoding slscpx  and slscpx- <dig>  mrna, respectively. the  <dig> -kb and  <dig> -kb transcripts of slscpx were probably the pre-mature and mature mrna products of the gene, respectively  <cit>  and they were highly and specifically expressed in the midgut . in contrast, the slscpx- <dig> mrna  was also detected in the fat body and epidermis in addition to the midgut during larval and pupal development . in the midgut, the expression of the slscpx transcripts was much higher during the larval feeding stages  than during the larval molting  stage and the larval to pupal transition  . the expression declined to a lower level after day  <dig> post pupation. the slscpx- <dig>  mrna was also detected in the epidermis and fat body when a labelled slscpx- <dig> dna fragment was used as a probe . when a labelled dna fragment of the slscpx-t region was used as a probe, only the slscpx  mrna transcripts were detected . these two transcripts were highly expressed during the feeding stage  of 6th instar larvae, but decreased when the larvae started wandering and entered the prepupal stage . these northern blotting analyses indicated that slscpx was specifically and highly expressed in the midgut during the larval feeding stage, while slscpx- <dig> mrna was also found in the epidermis and fat body, in addition to the midgut.

western blotting analysis was performed to examine the levels of these proteins in the different tissues and stages of 6th instar larvae . the anti-slscpx- <dig> antibody detected a single band of slscp- <dig> protein in the midgut and fat body of 3-day-old 6th instar larvae, but not in the epidermis . this was contrast to the northern blotting analysis where the slscpx- <dig> transcript was also detected in the epidermis . this is probably because only a very low level of slscpx- <dig> protein translation occurred in the epidermis at this stage. the anti-slscpx-t antibody detected a major 44-kda protein and a weak 58-kda protein, which were closely equivalent to the predicted molecular mass of the slscpx-t  and full-length slscpx proteins, respectively and as observed for bacterially expressed equivalents . no such proteins were detected in the fat body and epidermis, where another small unidentified protein immunologically reacted with the anti-slscpx-t antibody. these results indicated either that slscpx was post-translationally and proteolytically cleaved into two smaller proteins slscpx-t and slscpx- <dig>  or that the transcription of the slscpx gene was initiated at two different transcription initiation sites, generating a full-length slscpx mrna, which was translated into a full-length protein that was proteolytically cleaved into slscpx-t and slscpx- <dig> proteins post translationally, and a slscpx- <dig> mrna that was translated into a slscpx- <dig> protein. it was also noticed that the relative levels of slscpx-t and slscpx- <dig> proteins were higher than that of slscpx protein, suggesting that slscpx protein was rapidly cleaved into slscpx-t and slscpx- <dig> proteins after synthesis. the levels of the three proteins slscpx, slscpx-t, slscpx- <dig> were higher during the feeding stage  than non-feeding stages  . these results from protein analysis were consistent with the results of northern blotting analyses for mrna profiles.

tissue and cellular localization of slscpx, slscpx-t and slscpx- <dig> proteins in larvae and in vitro spli- <dig> cells
localization of slscpx, slscpx-t and slscpx- <dig> proteins in larvae was examined using immunohistochemistry . when anti-slscpx antibody was used as the primary antibody, the protein was detected mainly in the midgut of 2-day-old 6th instar larvae , although a trace amount of protein was also found in the epidermis and fat body. this result was consistent with the result of the western blotting analysis, in which the protein was mainly present in the midgut . in addition, the slscpx, slscpx-t and slscpx- <dig> proteins were distributed in the different regions of the midgut epithelium . the slscpx protein was distributed almost evenly in most of the epithelial cells , while the slscpx-t protein was detected mostly in the epithelial cells that were close to the lumen side  and the slscpx- <dig> protein was localized in the epithelial cells that were close to the basal membrane side of the midgut epithelium . subcellular distribution of the proteins was also examined by using two approaches. firstly, protein extracts were isolated from the cytosol and nuclear fractions, respectively, from the midgut epithelial cells of 3-day-old 6th instar larvae and were analyzed by western blots using anti-slscpx-t and anti-slscpx- <dig> antibodies . the anti-slscpx-t antibody detected two protein bands , presumably being slscpx and slscpx-t, respectively, at a higher level in the cytoplasm than in the nuclei of the epithelial cells , indicating that these two proteins were mainly present in the cytoplasmic fraction. the anti-slscpx- <dig> antibody detected the protein at a higher level in the nuclei than in the cytosplasm of the midgut epithelial cells , suggesting that the slscpx- <dig> protein was primarily in the nuclei. secondly, the embryogenic cell line, spli- <dig>  of s. litura was transfected with the eukaryotic expression vector pegfp- <dig> expressing slscpx/gfp, slscpx-t/gfp and slscpx-2/gfp fusion proteins, respectively . at  <dig> h post transfection, more than 60% of the cells expressed green fluorescence, indicating that most of the cells were transfected by the plasmid dnas. the confocal fluorescence microscopy observation on the transfected cells revealed that the green fluorescence signal in the control cells, which were transfected with the plasmid pegfp- <dig> expressing gfp alone, was seen in both the cytoplasm and nuclei . in the slscpx/gfp over-expressing cells the green fluorescence was detected only in the cytosol and almost no signal was found in the nuclei . in the slscpx-t/gfp over-expressing cells, stronger fluorescence signal was found in the cytoplasm than in the nuclei . the fluorescence signal of slscpx-2/gfp was also seen in both the cytoplasm and nuclei, but with a higher intensity in the nuclei than in the cytoplasm . all of these results from the immunohistochemistry of the midgut epithelial tissues , western blotting analyses of cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts , and transient expression of the gfp-marked proteins in the cultured spli- <dig> cells , taken together suggest that the slscpx and slscpx-t proteins are localized predominately in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells, particularly the cells that are close to the lumen side of the epithelium in the case of slscpx-t protein, while the slscpx- <dig> protein was localized in both the nuclei and the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells that were close to the basal membrane side of the midgut epithelium.

effect of slscpx and slscpx- <dig> expression on cholesterol uptake in the spli- <dig> cell line
to examine if slscpx protein can influence the cholesterol uptake, cholesterol levels in the transfected cells were measured and compared with that in the control cells. the intact slscpx coding region and slscpx- <dig> domain region alone were cloned, respectively, into the pegfp- <dig> vector replacing the gfp and under the control of the insect baculovirus ie <dig> promoter. the recombinant plasmids were used to transfect spli- <dig> cells to express these recombinant proteins. after overnight culture in sterol-free medium, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing  <dig>  mg cholesterol per ml of medium. the cells were collected after overnight culture in this sterol medium. protein expression and cholesterol levels in the cell extracts were analyzed. the anti-slscpx antibody detected 58-kda and 16-kda bands in the protein extracts from the slscpx- and slscpx-2-transfected cells, respectively , indicating that the recombinant proteins  were expressed in the transfected cells. an additional protein band of approximately 50-kda immunologically cross-reacted with the antibody in all of the transfected cells  and needs to be identified. hplc analysis of cholesterol levels in the transfected cells revealed that the slscpx and slscpx- <dig> transfected cells contained higher levels of cholesterol than the control cells transfected with the pegfp- <dig> vector . the effect of slscpx- <dig> appeared to be more significant  than slscpx  on the increase of the cholesterol level as compared to the control. this resulted suggests that expression of slscpx or slscpx- <dig> increased cholesterol uptake into the spli- <dig> cells from the sterol-containing medium.

effects of dsrna interference of slscpx transcripts on cholesterol uptake in larvae
to examine the function of slscpx, dsrna of slscpx was synthesized in vitro and injected into the hemolymph of larvae molting from 5th to 6th instar stage. rt-pcr and western blotting analyses indicated that the slscpx dsrna efficiently reduced the levels of both the slscpx and slscpx- <dig> transcripts  and the three proteins  of the target slscpx gene between day  <dig> and  <dig> post injection. the hemolymph was collected after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h post injection and cholesterol levels in the hemolymph were examined by using hplc. the results indicated that slscpx-dsrna-treated larvae had a significant decrease in the hemolymph cholesterol level at day  <dig>  and day  <dig>  post injection, as compared to the gfp-dsrna-treated control larvae . furthermore slscpx dsrna interference resulted in a delay in the larval development, for example, from the larval to the pupal transformation by an extension of 2- <dig> days as compared to the controls . all of the control larvae completed the molting process before day  <dig> post injection, whereas more than 40% of the slscpx-dsrna-treated larvae were still at the last larval stage until day  <dig> post injection. the slscpx-dsrna-treated larvae were smaller in body size than the control animals . the results from the rnai-treatment suggest that knocking down the transcripts of slscpx reduced the level of cholesterol in the hemolymph and retarded the growth and development of the larvae, probably by affecting the synthesis of ecdysteroid and cell membrane formation among other things.

discussion
the scp- <dig> gene family has been implicated in the absorption and transport of lipids, fatty acids and cholesterols  <cit> . studies have shown that scp- <dig> proteins have multiple functions because of their capability to bind with cholesterol, fatty acids and fatty acyl coa and regulating lipid rafts and signalling processes  <cit> . the human scpx gene, which is a member of the scp- <dig> family, encodes a 58-kda fusion protein that is post-translationally processed into a 46-kda thiolase and a 13-kda scp- <dig> protein. only one single copy of the scpx/scp- <dig> gene is found in the genomes of humans, mice and rats  <cit> . in c. elegans the homologous gene encodes a p <dig> protein, which lacks the scp- <dig> domain at the 3'-terminal region of the protein  <cit> . in diptera, such as d. melanogaster and a. aegypti, scpx gene produces a single transcript encoding a full-length scpx, but does not encode scp- <dig> mrna  <cit> . instead, separate genes in the a. aegypti genome encode small scp- <dig> and scp-2-like proteins, which do not contain the thiolase domain  <cit> . in lepidopteran insects, such as s. littoralis  <cit>  and b. mori  <cit> , which is a very close allopatric species of s. litura, a single scpx/scp- <dig> gene encodes both scpx and scp- <dig> mrnas, which suggests that it is generated by alternative splicing into two mrna isoforms after transcription and no other separate scp- <dig> genes for scp- <dig> proteins are present in these lepidopteran genomes. in this study, northern blotting analysis detected three transcripts of  <dig>  kb ,  <dig>  kb  and  <dig>  kb  in the midgut of s. litura when a dna fragment of the scp- <dig> coding region  of slscpx was used as a probe . however, when the slscpx-t region of the slscpx gene was used as a probe, the  <dig>  kb band was not detected . rt-pcr using a pair of primers specific to the 5'-terminus and 3'-teminus of the full-length scpx orf and total rna isolated from the larval tissues amplified two cdnas that encoded for the full-length slscpx mrna and the slscpx- <dig> domain mrna, respectively . there are at least three possible explanations for the multiple transcripts of slscpx gene: one is that the two amplified mrna transcripts are the products of the same slscpx gene, but result from different transcription initiation sites, as is the case in human scpx/scp <dig> gene  <cit> . in humans, the scpx gene generates a  <dig> -kb mrna encoding a fused 58-kda protein  and a  <dig> -kb mrna encoding only a  <dig> -kda scp- <dig> protein  <cit> . the 58-kda protein was post-translationally cleaved into 46-kda thiolase and 15-kda scp- <dig> proteins  <cit> . the 15-kda pro-scp- <dig> protein is the precursor of the mature 13-kda scp- <dig> and the 20-amino acid peptide at the 5'-terminal end may alter scp- <dig> structure to facilitate peroxisomal targeting  <cit> . however, in the present study the promoter sequence of the gene was not determined and the genomic organization of the gene has not been elucidated, therefore we do not know if there was any promoter regulation of the gene to provide two transcripts. a second possibility is that there are other separate genes that encode scp- <dig> mrna transcripts in the midgut. however, southern blotting analysis of genomic dna indicated that only a single band was detected , suggesting that only one gene of slscpx is present in the genome. thirdly, perhaps two transcripts were derived from alternative splicing of a full-length transcript  into the two transcripts post transcriptionally, encoding the full-length slscpx and slscpx- <dig>  respectively, as suggested by the two full-length slscpx mrna and slscpx- <dig> mrna amplified pcr products detected . because the primers used would be unable to detect a transcript for the slscpx-t region only we cannot rule out such a transcript. nevertheless, northern blotting analyses revealed that no mrna transcript for slscpx-t only, which was expected to be  <dig>  kb, was detected when either slscpx or slscpx-t dna fragment was used as a probe. therefore, the most likely explanation is that the full-length transcript  was alternatively spliced into the two transcripts post transcriptionally. our hypothesis concurs with the demonstration in b. mori, where the bmscpx/scp- <dig> gene also contains thiolase and scp- <dig> domains and they are encoded by two separate exons, respectively  <cit> , generating two isoforms of scpx and scp- <dig> mrna. this is also similar to the cases in mammals  <cit>  but differs from the diptera, such as d. melanogaster and a. aegypti, in which the scpx gene generates only scpx mrna but not scp- <dig> mrna  <cit> . these results and analyses suggest a hypothesis that the s. litura slscpx gene produces an mrna transcript that contains both a slscpx-t domain for a 3-oxoacyl-coa thiolase and a slscpx- <dig> domain for a scp- <dig> protein, and a slscpx- <dig> mrna transcript for slscp- <dig> protein by splicing . it is interesting that in the feeding larvae the slscp- <dig> mrna was found not only in the midgut but also in the epidermis and fat body, where no slscpx mrna was detected. this suggests that this alternative transcription of slscx- <dig> can occur in different tissues other than the midgut. however, although there was slscpx- <dig> transcripts detected in the epidermis of feeding larvae, for example at day  <dig> of 6th instar stage , but no immunoreactive protein of slscpx- <dig> was detected by western blotting analysis. this probably indicates that only a low level of slscpx- <dig> protein translation occurred in the epidermis at this stage, although the slscpx- <dig> transcripts were present. the regulatory mechanism for transcription and translation of the slscpx- <dig> gene is worth to be further examined.

in addition to the regulation of gene expression at the transcription level, the regulation of the protein production can take place at the post-translational level. the anti-slscpx-t antibody detected two protein products of  <dig> kda  and  <dig> kda  in the midgut , while the anti-slscpx- <dig> antibody detected a product of  <dig> kda  in the midgut and fat body . these data suggest that the slscpx gene is transcribed into a full-length mrna that is translated into a polypeptide, which is proteolytically cleaved into two peptides: 3-oxoacyl-coa thiolase  and slscpx- <dig>  through a post translational activity. it was also observed that the slscpx protein was cleaved into thiolase and scp- <dig> at a much higher level  than the vertebrate scpx which is processed into the thiolase domain and scp- <dig> domain proteins post-translationally at about 50% level  <cit> .

in mouse, knocking out the scpx/scp- <dig> gene, which affect both scpx and scp- <dig> expression, showed that this gene is required for peroxisomal β-oxidation of methyl-branched fatty acyl-coas and bile acid precursors  <cit> . in human, scpx mutation, which only affected scpx but not scp- <dig> expression, resulted in an accumulation of the branched-chain fatty acid, pristanic acid, and excretion of abnormal bile alcohol glucuronides in urine  <cit> . these results indicate that the scpx gene plays critical roles in the breakdown of branched-chain fatty acids and bile acid metabolism. some other studies have revealed that scpx/scp- <dig> and scp- <dig> proteins are involved in cholesterol binding and transport  <cit> . three lines of evidence show that both of the slscpx and slscpx- <dig> proteins play critical roles in cholesterol absorption in s. litura. firstly, northern and western blotting analyses showed that the slscpx mrna was specifically present at higher levels in the midgut of the feeding 6th larvae , while the slscpx- <dig> mrna was predominately present in the midgut, but also in both the fat body and epidermis . the expression of slscpx mrna was much higher during the feeding stages than the non-feeding stages, indicating that these proteins may be necessary for absorption and transport of nutrients such as cholesterol, during larval feeding stages. secondly, the over-expression of slscpx and slscpx- <dig> proteins increased cholesterol uptake into the in vitro cultured s. litura spli- <dig> cells from the culture medium . thirdly, when the slscpx mrna was suppressed by slscpx dsrna interference the hemolymph cholesterol level in the treated larvae decreased and the development of the insect was delayed . collectively these results suggest that slscpx and slscpx- <dig> may play critical roles in cholesterol absorption in s. litura.

this study provides evidence for the association or links among scpx gene, cholesterol accumulation and development in lepidopteran insects. insects must take up cholesterol from their diet and accumulate the cholesterol in their bodies during the feeding stages for their growth and development because they lack key cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes, such as squalene monooxygenase, and lanosterol synthase  <cit> . the midgut and possibly the foregut are the sites of cholesterol absorption  <cit>  and the midgut is a major site for cholesterol absorption into the hemolymph  <cit> . it has also been demonstrated that scp- <dig> protein is necessary for cholesterol uptake in a. aegypti  <cit> . knocking down aescp <dig> transcript expression in a. aegypti resulted in a reduction of cholesterol accumulation in pupae and a high mortality in developing adults and reduced egg viability  <cit> . it is well known that cholesterol is a precursor of 20-hydroxyecdysone  and is a structural component of cell membranes  <cit> . when cholesterol is absent from the diet, the heliothis zea neonate larvae fail to molt into 2nd instar stage or suffer a delay in larval growth and pupation  <cit> . the present study demonstrates an association or link between scpx gene, cholesterol accumulation and larval development. like aescp <dig> in a. aegypti  <cit> , interference in expression of the slscpx transcript in the larvae that just molted into 6th instar stage resulted in a decrease in the cholesterol accumulation in the hemolymph and a delay in the larval development and pupation . since cholesterol is a precursor of 20e and is a structural component of cell membranes  <cit> , inhibition of uptake and transport of cholesterol by slscpx rnai would impacts adversely on the biosynthesis of 20e that initiates and regulates molting and metamorphosis, resulting in a delay in larval development and pupation. however, in this study only hemoplymph cholesterol levels were examined and the cholesterol levels in the fat body and midgut as well as other tissues were not determined. whether or not the changes in the hemoplymph cholesterol levels are due to the release of cholesterol from other tissues such as the fat body need to be examined. direct evidence for the 20e level alteration by the slscpx suppression and cholesterol accumulation will help define the relationships among these three processes. another possible mechanism for the inhibition of larval growth and metamorphosis by slscpx suppression is that these proteins may be involved in fatty acid metabolism  <cit>  and signal transduction  <cit>  and may have to be examined. since slscpx dsrna covering the slscpx-t and slscpx- <dig> domains  were used to inhibit the slscpx transcription and it appeared that both of slscpx and slscpx- <dig> transcripts were efficiently knocked down , and it is not clear which protein, if either plays a more critical role in cholesterol accumulation, ecdysteroid synthesis and larval-pupal transformation. we have laid the groundwork for further studies to critically examine the different possibilities.

in vertebrates, although amino acid sequences of the c-terminal region  of scpx and other scp- <dig> proteins are identical and have a peroxisomal localization signal sequence , scpx locates exclusively in peroxisomes, while scp- <dig> is found in both peroxisomes and cytosol  <cit> . in a. aegypti, aescpx is mostly restricted in the peroxisomes, whereas aescp <dig> encoded by another independent aescp <dig> gene was detected mostly in the cytosol  <cit> . a recent study indicates that the human scpx protein undergoes post-translational processing on the peroxisomal surface, releasing a short c-terminal product  that acts as a transcription factor  <cit> . it has been reported that scpx/scp- <dig> is regulated through the forkhead transcription factor foxo3a and scp- <dig> is speculated to protect fatty acids from peroxidation  <cit> . the preliminary results of the present study indicate that slscpx, slscpx-t and slscpx- <dig> proteins were distinct in their subcellular distribution. in the transfected spli- <dig> cells, slscpx and slscpx-t proteins were present mostly in the cytoplasm , while slscpx- <dig> was localized in both the nuclei and cytoplasm, with a slightly higher level in the nuclei than in the cytoplasm . but it remains unclear whether or not slscpx- <dig> in nuclei acts as a transcription factor. interestingly, it was found that the slscpx, slscpx-t and slscpx- <dig> proteins had different distributions in the midgut epithelium of the feeding larvae . slscpx protein  was detected by the anti-slscpx antibody, which is expected to immunologically react with both of slscpx-t and slscpx- <dig> proteins, throughout the epithelial cells , while the slscpx-t protein detected by the specific anti-slscpx-t antibody was distributed predominately in the epithelial cells that were close to the lumen side  and the slscpx- <dig> protein detected by the specific anti-slscpx- <dig> antibody was localized in the cells that were close to the basal membrane side of the midgut epithelium . these observations may indicate that slscpx-t and slscpx- <dig> proteins play different roles in cholesterol uptake and transport in the midgut of s. litura. in the in vitro transfection experiments using spli- <dig> cells, the slscpx/gfp fusion proteins contained a gfp peptide. it is not clear if this extra peptide can interfere with the accurate localization, although many reports in the literature indicate that this technique has been used to determine the localization of target genes. higher resolution is critical to unambiguously establish the sub-cellular localization which should be done in subsequent study. having established the characterization of the gene and the broad functional analyses we are now in a position to unravel the mechanism behind our observation.

CONCLUSIONS
cholesterol is required for cell membranes and ecdysteroid biosynthesis in insects. ecdysteroids regulate growth, development and reproduction in insects. however, insects cannot synthesize cholesterol through de novo biosynthesis and therefore insects must obtain cholesterol or sterols from their diet to fulfill the requirements for their normal growth, development and reproduction. in the present study, by analyzing the gene expression patterns, protein localization, protein over-expression and transcript interference we demonstrated that the slscpx gene was expressed predominately in the midgut of larvae at the feeding stages and was involved in cholesterol uptake and normal development in s. litura. interference of this gene resulted in a decrease in cholesterol uptake, which may result in inhibition of ecdysteroid biosynthesis and consequently a delay in the larval-pupal metamorphosis. besides understanding the mechanism of cholesterol uptake this study might provide a potential molecular target for insect pest management.
