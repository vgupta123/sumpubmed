BACKGROUND
the unfolded protein response  is an intracellular signaling pathway that provides homeostatic feedback regulation between the endoplasmic reticulum  and the gene expression program in the nucleus. to this end, the upr senses the conditions inside the er, detecting an imbalance between newly made proteins and the protein folding capacity in the er, and activates a corrective response. for signaling, the upr uses a transmembrane sensor of er-lumenal unfolded proteins, ire <dig> 

ire <dig> is an er membrane-resident receptor that serves as a primary signal transduction device in the upr conserved from yeast to mammalian cells  <cit> . oligomerization of ire1-lumenal domains is thought to be a key event in initiating signal propagation across the er membrane that enables the cooperative assembly of ire1's cytosolic kinase and rnase modules into an ordered oligomer with a defined three-dimensional structure  <cit> . the oligomer is stabilized by phosphates resulting from autophosphorylation of the kinase domain and allows juxtaposition of ire1's rnase domains, which presumably activate the rnase  <cit> . once activated, ire <dig> initiates the non-conventional splicing of hac <dig> mrna  or xbp <dig> mrna  by cleaving the mrna at two conserved sites to excise an intron  <cit> . an rna ligase  rejoins the severed exons to complete the reaction. intron removal allows for the production of the upr transcription activators hac <dig> and xbp <dig>  respectively, which upregulate upr target genes.

ire1's rnase domain thereby serves the primary role in signal transmission. the mechanism underlying activation of ire <dig> rnase by oligomerization and the mechanism of mrna recognition and cleavage have remained elusive. to date, there are no known structural homologues of the ire <dig> rnase domain that could help answering these questions. the best attempt at defining the mechanism of rna cleavage has been made based on sequence conservation arguments and on a crystal structure of ire <dig> dimer with a ligand-free rnase domain, which also lacked a fragment of the rnase active site  <cit> . in this work, the rnase dimer was proposed to contain two independent catalytic centers, one per ire <dig> monomer, which would simultaneously accommodate the two rna stem-loops conserved in all known mrna substrates of ire <dig>  <cit> . according to the proposed model, two stem-loops would form a kissing interaction for docking and recognition by ire <dig>  subsequent studies proposed  <cit>  that such a kissing interaction is not likely because ire <dig> exhibits no preference for rna substrates with dual stem-loops over substrates with a single stem-loop, indicating that a single stem-loop structure is the cognate folded substrate of ire <dig> rnase.

it has been also suggested  <cit>  that putative active site residues are positioned similarly in ire <dig> rnase and in pre-trna splicing endonuclease , although these two endoribonucleases share no apparent sequence or structural homology and cleave dissimilar rna substrates . the authors point out  <cit>  that the putative catalytic residues in ire <dig> do not align completely with those in sen and would require a 5-Å displacement of y <dig>  to bring it into a position corresponding to that of y <dig> in sen. a 5-Å conformational change in ire <dig> rnase upon substrate binding has been proposed based on these arguments  <cit> . a new cocrystal structure of ire <dig> rnase with an oligonucleotide bound, which we provide in this work, does not support considerable conformational changes in the position of y <dig>  therefore, ire <dig> and sen apparently cleave rna using different arrangements of active site residues. underscoring this difference, substitution of a single catalytic histidine residue h <dig> produced orders-of-magnitude greater effect on the catalytic activity of ire <dig>  compared to only a 28-fold rate reduction in sen  <cit> .

conservation of residue h <dig>  the only invariant histidine in the rnase domain of ire <dig>  was used to propose that h <dig> marks the catalytic center and serves for general acid-general base catalysis  <cit> . in agreement with this model, mutation h1061a reduced rna cleavage  <cit> . however, this mutation was analyzed using a qualitative approach that had a narrow dynamic range and did not distinguish between effects on binding and catalysis. furthermore, mutation h1061a not only removed the ability of histidine to transfer protons but also the ability to form hydrogen bonds, which alone could explain the observed effect on rna cleavage, without invoking h <dig> in general acid-general base catalysis. considering that ribonucleases can cleave rna stem-loops by using for proton transfer basic amino acids instead of conventional ionizable residues   <cit> , the very involvement of h <dig> in general acid-general base catalysis could not be deduced convincingly from any of the available data.

to understand the mechanism of rna cleavage by ire <dig>  we combined quantitative analysis of rationally designed ire <dig> mutants and x-ray crystallography. we show that proton transfer by histidine h <dig> contributes greater than five orders of magnitude  to catalysis of rna cleavage, which experimentally defines a key catalytic functionality in the active center of ire <dig> rnase. using the non-disruptive y1043f mutation we experimentally demonstrate a catalytic role of the oh group of y <dig> and also show an important role in rna binding of a helix-loop element  residue, r <dig>  our findings suggest parallels between catalytic centers of ire <dig> and the well characterized rnases a and t <dig> and propose an unexpected mechanism of oligomerization-induced in trans rna recognition by ire <dig> 

RESULTS
computational analysis of the rna binding properties of ire1
to glean insights into ire <dig> interactions with hac1/xbp <dig> mrna, we analyzed the rna binding properties of the entire surface of the ire <dig> oligomer  <cit> . surface electrostatics calculations  <cit>  are commonly used for such analyses, but they produce ambiguous results because electrostatics is not the sole determinant of rna binding. here we used a modified optimal protein-rna area  algorithm that previously demonstrated high prediction accuracy  <cit> . we refined this method by adding phylogenetic conservation to the scores and termed the resulting algorithm 'conservation-weighted opra' . the cwopra analysis of rna binding properties of the ire <dig> oligomer produced a high-contrast image of the surface rna binding propensity. a single rna binding site was strongly predicted in the center of every back-to-back rnase dimer  <cit> . the rna binding site is proximal to the dynamic helix-loop element hle, which becomes more ordered upon formation of ire1/ire <dig> interfaces in the high-order oligomer and has been proposed to serve as a part of the active site  <cit>  . the rest of the ire <dig> surface was predicted not to interact with rna . we next validated this computational prediction using a cocrystal structure of ire <dig> with an oligonucleotide.

crystal structure of ire <dig> with dcdcdgdcdadg bound to the rnase domain
for crystallization trials, we tested a panel of rnase-resistant rna analogs with 2'-deoxy or 2'-methoxy substitutions throughout and a variety of ire <dig> constructs. only a single combination led to formation of diffracting crystals as discussed below. attempts to soak mononucleotides, dinucleotides, trinucleotides or oligonucleotides  into previously characterized ire <dig> crystals  <cit>  were unsuccessful. no additional difference density was observed, which could correspond to the soaked-in substrate analogs.

by contrast, cocrystallization of ire1kr <dig> with a 6-mer 2'-deoxy-substituted oligonucleotide bearing the consensus sequence of an ire <dig> splice site ccgcag  resulted in crystals of the ire1kr32·dcdcdgdcdadg complex. ire1kr <dig> construct contains the ire1's kinase domain, the rnase domain, and a 32-amino-acid linker previously shown to be required for optimal rnase activity  <cit> . the dcdcdgdcdadg oligonucleotide bound to ire1kr <dig> with kiapp =  <dig> μm determined from inhibition of the ire1kr32-catalyzed cleavage of hp <dig>  a small stem/loop structure containing the 3' splice site of xbp <dig> mrna  <cit> . this value is approximately 40-fold weaker than that for the cognate stem-loop  possibly due to a more flexible structure of the single-stranded oligonucleotide dcdcdgdcdadg compared to hp <dig> rna stem-loop and/or due to the lack of 2'oh groups. unlike the oligonucleotide-free ire <dig>  which crystallizes in space group p <dig>  <cit> , the ire1kr32·dcdcdgdcdadg oligomer crystallized in space group c <dig> and diffracted to  <dig>  Å . the presence of the oligonucleotide allowed ire1kr <dig> to crystallize without a ligand occupying the kinase atp binding pocket, providing an important insight into the mechanism of cofactor-dependent activation of ire <dig>  <cit> .

we used the  <dig> -Å structure of ire <dig> crystallized in the absence of a nucleic acid substrate  <cit>  for molecular replacement and subsequent rigid-body refinement, as described in methods and in the accompanying manuscript  <cit> . at 6- <dig> Å resolution, the secondary structure of proteins and the sugar-phosphate backbone, which is the most electron-dense part of nucleic acids, can be visualized in ribonucleoprotein complexes  <cit> . accordingly, we observed a strong fo-fc difference electron density at the core of the rnase domain, which coincided with the cwopra-predicted rna binding site . the electron density was delineated by two separate contours related by twofold symmetry . each contour  defines an elongated volume of approximately  <dig> Å in length, consistent with the length of one dcdcdgdcdadg molecule bound per rnase monomer. we placed ire <dig> side chains according to the  <dig> -Å-resolution search model used for the molecular replacement . such an approximation is valid because the protein backbone traces and the quaternary structure of ire <dig> oligomers superimpose in the  <dig> Å and the  <dig> Å structures, even though they crystallized in different space groups . based on the complete superposition of the polypeptide backbones in ire1kr32·apy <dig>  <cit>  and in ire1·dcdcdgdcdadg complexes, we can rule out the possibility of a large-scale movement in the catalytic core of ire <dig> upon binding of the substrate analog.

probing the catalytic mechanism of ire <dig> rnase via mutagenesis: role of h1061
the electron density for dcdcdgdcdadg is located in the cleft formed by the hles  <cit> . the position of the electron density suggests that eight protonatable residues of ire <dig> located proximal to the substrate mimic could, in principle, contribute to general acid-general base catalysis leading to the formation of the 2', 3'-cyclic phosphate  <cit> . because ire <dig> does not require divalent metal ions for rnase activity  <cit> , it must rely exclusively on amino acid side chains to carry out catalysis. in the identified group of amino acids, only h <dig> and d <dig> have pka values near neutrality, analogous to the catalytic residues involved in proton transfer in well characterized ribonucleases, such as rnase a  <cit>  and rnase t <dig>  <cit> . the h <dig> is invariant in all known ire <dig> sequences and the only ire <dig> homologue rnase l  <cit> . by contrast, d <dig> is mutated in several organisms to residues incapable of proton transfer , indicating that it is dispensable for catalysis.

mutation of the catalytic histidine to alanine, asparagine or glutamine diminishes catalysis by ribonucleases t <dig> and a by  <dig> to 104-fold  <cit> . in a previous study, an h1061a mutation in ire <dig> was reported to inhibit the rnase activity; however, the quantitative effect of this mutation on catalysis has not been measured  <cit> . to determine the quantitative contribution of h <dig> to catalysis, we expressed and purified a mutant of ire1kr <dig> in which h <dig> was replaced by asparagine. we chose mutation to asparagine because it best preserves the space filling and hydrogen bonding properties of histidine, while removing histidine's ability to transfer protons and to support catalysis. we observed that ire1kr <dig> displays a ≥  <dig> × 105-fold rate reduction compared to wild-type ire1kr <dig> , strongly indicating that h <dig> plays a central part in catalysis.

next, we ruled out a possibility that the large effect of the h1061n mutation arose from a perturbation of oligomerization. to this end, we monitored the optical density of ire1kr <dig> solutions at  <dig> nm, which provides a quantitative measure of ire1kr <dig> oligomerization . ire1kr <dig> mutant exhibited an indistinguishable oligomerization profile from that of wild-type ire1kr <dig> , suggesting that the h1061n mutation does not interfere with oligomer formation.

to further ascertain that the dramatic rate reduction does not arise from more local conformational perturbations of ire <dig> rnase, uncoupled from oligomerization, we crystallized ire1kr <dig> in complex with the synthetic ligand apy <dig>  which binds in ire1's kinase atp binding pocket  <cit> . we determined a  <dig> -Å-resolution crystal structure of this mutant , which proved identical to that of wild-type ire1kr <dig> . our functional and structural results pertaining to h1061n mutant therefore indicate that the greater than  <dig> × 105-fold catalytic impairment of ire1kr <dig> arises from a direct role of h <dig> in proton transfer during rna cleavage.

due to the twofold symmetry of the ire <dig> rnase dimer  <cit> , a single h1061n mutation removes two h <dig> residues in the vicinity of the rnase active site . we thus wondered whether the catalytic impairment of the h1061n mutant might arise from this symmetry: if ire <dig> required both h <dig> residues together to catalyze phosphodiester cleavage, we would de facto have measured activity of a double mutant. to explore this possibility, we built ire <dig> oligomers in which each catalytic h <dig> would be paired with a non-catalytic h1061n in chimeric rnase dimers. to this end, we titrated catalytically inactive ire1kr <dig> into a solution of wild-type ire1kr <dig> held at a constant concentration just below its oligomerization threshold. for enzymes that follow michaelis-menten kinetics, addition of a catalytically inactive mutant to a wild-type reaction inhibits the rate, as inactive enzyme sequesters the available substrate. by contrast, we observed approximately tenfold activation of ire1kr <dig> before onset of inhibition at excessive concentrations of ire1kr <dig> . stimulation occurs because wild-type ire1kr <dig> becomes trapped in a wild-type/h1061n hetero-oligomer as enzyme concentration increases and causes ire <dig> to oligomerize. kinetic modeling of this experiment shows that such a response is expected only if wild-type:h1061n heterodimers in the ire1kr <dig> oligomer were active rnases . we conclude that only one of the two h <dig> residues in the twofold symmetric rnase dimer is required for rna cleavage.

proximity to the electron density of the substrate, mutagenesis analysis, evolutionary conservation and the neutral pka value of histidine all converge on the suggestion that h <dig> serves a catalytic function. cleavage of an rna backbone by other non-metal rnases involves pairs of conserved residues that carry out general acid-general base catalysis and lie at a fixed mutual separation of 6- <dig> Å . in ire <dig>  only two invariant amino acids, r <dig> and y <dig>  are located  <dig>  Å and  <dig> Å from h <dig>  respectively , and hence emerge as candidates to be a catalytic partner of h <dig>  steric considerations discussed below and high pka value of arginine argue that r <dig> is unlikely to fulfill this role, suggesting y <dig> as the most plausible partner of h <dig> . we note that the r <dig> side chain is deeply buried in the active site, which would make it difficult to interpret results of mutational analyses. we therefore did not pursue analysis of r <dig> at this time.

probing the role of y <dig> as the catalytic partner of h1061
previously, it was suggested that if ire <dig> rnase resembled sen endoribonuclease, then tyrosine y <dig> may serve as the general base  <cit> . the fact that y <dig> resides approximately  <dig> Å from the analogous tyrosine in sen was used to propose that ire <dig> rnase should undergo an obligate conformational change upon binding of substrate to position y <dig> relative to h <dig> as in sen. to test this possibility, we examined the electron density for the y1043-bearing loop in the ire1kr32·dcdcdgdcdadg complex . we found that backbones of the hle and of the adjacent y1043-bearing loop occupy the same position as in the  <dig> -Å crystal structure obtained without bound oligonucleotide . these findings support a model that tyrosine y <dig> does not move over a significant distance upon substrate binding.

to assess whether y <dig> contributes to catalysis, we prepared and quantitatively characterized the mutant ire1kr <dig>  which is predicted to disable any involvement of y <dig> in proton transfer while ensuring minimal structural perturbation to the protein compared to a potentially far more disruptive y1043a mutation tested previously  <cit> . we obtained an activation profile with ire1kr <dig> . at enzyme concentrations exceeding  <dig> μm, the observed rate constant for cleavage of hp <dig> rna plateaued at a first-order single-turnover rate constant k <dig> =  <dig>  s- <dig>  this value is approximately tenfold smaller than the corresponding value for wild-type ire1kr <dig> , demonstrating that the oh group of y <dig> is important for catalysis. similar to the h1061n mutation, the y1043f mutation had no effect on the oligomerization equilibrium of ire1kr <dig> . the deleterious effect of the y1043f mutation was greater at subsaturating k2/k1/ <dig> conditions encountered below approximately  <dig> μm enzyme concentrations, indicating that y <dig> also contributes to binding of the rna substrate .

probing the role of the hle in rna recognition
location of the dcdcdgdcdadg electron density in proximity to the hle  confirms the previously posed hypothesis  <cit>  that this element serves as an important part of the active site. it was proposed that residues from hles could serve for binding and recognition of rna substrates, rather than for catalysis. mutations in the hle are therefore expected to provide a valuable control to contrast the catalytically important mutations of h <dig> and y <dig> described above. to test the role of the hle in rna cleavage, we prepared ire1kr <dig> with a mutation of an arginine residue within the hle, ire1kr <dig> and measured the titration rate profile for the ire1kr <dig> mutant . at saturating enzyme concentrations ire1kr <dig> achieved the same first-order single-turnover rate constant k <dig> as did wild-type ire1kr <dig> , indicating that r <dig> makes no contribution to stabilization of the transition state. under subsaturating conditions, however, the r1039a mutant became deleterious, revealing a role of r <dig> in substrate binding. analogous to other mutations tested here, ire1kr <dig> exhibited an unperturbed oligomerization profile , indicating that this mutation too does not affect the enzyme's oligomerization equilibrium. both structural  and functional data with ire1kr <dig> therefore show that the hle plays an important role in recognition of rna substrates.

electron density-guided docking of an rna stem-loop into ire <dig> rnase  suggests that the hle of one rnase monomer may contribute to rna cleavage in the active site of an adjacent rnase monomer, acting in trans. to test this possibility, we performed in trans activation experiments as in figure 2d, in which we analyzed the activity of ire1kr32/ire1kr <dig> heterodimers. to ensure that effect of the r1039a mutation is indeed measured in trans, we additionally disabled the catalytic site of the r1039a mutant by the h1061n mutation, as outlined in figure 4a. the experiment was conducted as in figure 2d, but contained lower concentration of wild-type ire1kr <dig>  to ascertain a regime in which subsaturating conditions  were maintained during the titration. this was an important consideration because if the reactions were allowed to approach the first-order k <dig> regime, the deleterious effect of the r1039a mutation on binding would have been masked . using this experiment, we found that the rnase activity of wild-type ire1kr <dig> stimulated in trans by the double mutant ire1kr <dig> was an order-of-magnitude lower than with the h1061n single mutant . the chimeric dimer with the double mutation  therefore binds rna more weakly than the chimeric dimer with the single mutation , whereas the only difference between these two cases is an intact hle  versus a hle bearing a single r1039a mutation . it follows that the rna cleavage reaction catalyzed by one rnase monomer is sensitive to a mutation in the hle of the paired monomer. these observations strongly support a model of a composite rna-binding surface in ire <dig> rnase, which also emerges from the electron density-guided rna stem-loop docking described below.

ire <dig> site-specifically cleaves stem-loop anticodon of trnaphe
ire <dig> recognizes and site-specifically cleaves conserved sites in hac <dig> and xbp <dig> mrna, which are characterized by a stem containing approximately five watson-crick base pairs and a seven-residue loop with a consensus sequence cngnngn  <cit> . to understand how ire <dig> might recognize such stem-loops, we searched bioinformatically for rna heptaloops with similar features. this search showed that the anticodon stem-loop of trnaphe closely resembles the ire <dig> consensus substrate . to verify that this sequence similarity meaningfully identifies an ire <dig> substrate, we conducted rna cleavage assays and compared the kinetics of cleavage by ire <dig> of trnaphe anticodon stem-loop and cleavage of the stem-loop derived from xbp <dig> mrna, hp <dig>  ire <dig> cleaved both stem-loops in a single site and with similar rates , indicating that the trnaphe anticodon stem-loop indeed provides a good model of the cognate ire <dig> stem-loops from xbp <dig> and hac <dig> mrna. as multiple crystal structures of trnaphe have been already solved, this finding enabled us to model the docking of an rna stem-loop to the ire <dig> rnase active site .

discussion
the architecture of ire <dig> rnase
our conclusion that each ire <dig> monomer contains a complete catalytic center in the context of the ire <dig> oligomer agrees with the model proposed previously based on experiments in which several ire <dig> variants with dissimilar rnase-inactivating mutations were mixed  <cit> . the previous observation showed that none of the mutant mixtures have rnase activity and was interpreted in favor of individual active sites over a composite catalytic center   <cit> . importantly, however, this lack of rnase activity can be reasonably reconciled with both, per monomer and composite active site architectures, as well as with a third possibility of indirect defects in ire <dig> rnase due to misfolding or conformational perturbation of the mutants. by contrast, the observation of electron density for a substrate mimic in each rnase monomer  and in trans activation of wild-type ire1kr <dig> by ire1kr <dig>  provide strong experimental support for an individual catalytic center in each rnase monomer.

position of the scissile phosphate and the catalytic mechanism of ire <dig> rnase
we deduce the position of the scissile phosphate of a bona fide ire <dig> rna substrate in this catalytic center using the structure of the ire1kr <dig> complexed with a dna hexanucleotide, dcdcdgdcdadg, which mimics the cognate ire <dig> substrate. this substrate analog was chosen due to present experimental limitations imposed by the inability of ire <dig> to cocrystallize with other oligonucleotides. while we recognize that the deoxy-substituted single-stranded substrate may be structurally distinct from rna stem-loops, we surmise that its binding site on ire <dig> represents that of the hp <dig> rna because  dcdcdgdcdadg efficiently inhibits cleavage of hp <dig> by ire1kr <dig>  and  the electron density in the rnase active site directly contacts the critical catalytic residue h <dig>  which is involved in proton transfer and contributes ≥  <dig> × 105-fold to catalysis. at high contour levels, we could identify three near-spherical peaks in a fo-fc fourier map. the central peak was strongest and was visible in most ire <dig> monomers in the asymmetric unit, while the other two peaks could be observed in several but not all ire <dig> monomers. because the central peak most likely represents the most-ordered phosphate group of the oligonucleotide and is located between the functionally validated catalytic residues h <dig> and y <dig> , we suggest that it corresponds to the position of the scissile phosphate of the substrate.

placement of this phosphate and comparison of the active site of ire <dig> with the active sites of rnase t <dig> and a suggest putative roles of ire <dig> residues in catalysis . similar to ire <dig>  ribonucleases t <dig> and a do not use metal ions  <cit>  and produce 2',3'-cyclic phosphate  <cit> . importantly, the mechanisms of rna cleavage have been established in detail for both rnase t <dig> and rnase a  <cit> .

structural comparison shows that ire <dig> and rnases t <dig> and a have a single positively charged residue contacting the phosphate: r <dig> , r <dig>  and k <dig> . these positively charged residues serve for catalysis by stabilizing the negative charge buildup on non-bridging oxygens in the transition state, as has been shown for rnase a  <cit> . by analogy, r <dig> of ire <dig> may also participate in transition state stabilization and is unlikely to directly participate in proton transfer. the last notion is supported by steric considerations: r1056-phosphate-h <dig> connectivity would form an atypically acute angle for a general acid-phosphate-general base triad, placing phosphate entirely off the line connecting the two protein residues implicated in proton transfer . this arrangement would not be compatible with in-line geometry required for rna cleavage to form a 2',3'-cyclic product.

in rnase t <dig> and rnase a, a single uncharged hydrophilic residue is positioned off the line connecting general acid, scissile phosphate and general base, and at a hydrogen-bonding distance from the phosphate oxygens: y <dig> in rnase t <dig> and n <dig> in rnase a, respectively. in rnases t <dig> and a, these residues play a catalytic role by stabilizing the transition state via coordination of non-bridging oxygen  <cit> . position of the electron density in ire <dig>  predicts an analogous catalytic function for n <dig> 

finally, all three rnases contain two residues that act as a general acid/general base pair. for rnases t <dig> and a, general acids are h <dig> and h <dig> at a distance of  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å from the scissile phosphate, respectively. general bases are h <dig> and h <dig> at a distance  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, respectively. the position of the electron density for the phosphate between the h <dig> and y <dig>  agrees with the role of these residues in ire <dig> as the general acid/general base pair . whereas the role of h <dig> parallels that of the histidines in rnase t <dig> and a, a catalytic tyrosine is unusual because of the high pka of approximately  <dig>  experimental testing of the catalytic role of y <dig> using an y1043f mutation revealed that the hydroxy group of y <dig> contributes a rate enhancement of approximately tenfold  to catalysis. our data therefore are in agreement with the catalytic role of y <dig> and suggest two kinetically equivalent catalytic mechanisms shown in figure 3c. we note that the tenfold transition-state effect of the y1043f mutation is modest and thus it could also be consistent with a third possibility that the oh group of y <dig> plays an indirect role in catalysis and forms an important hydrogen-bonding network in the active site rather than participates in proton transfer directly. this alternative possibility cannot be ruled out until an atomic resolution cocrystal structure of an ire1-rna complex becomes available. if y <dig> serves for proton transfer directly, then its relatively small catalytic contribution compared to the ≥  <dig> × 105-fold contribution of the partnering h <dig> residue or the  <dig> to 104-fold contributions of the catalytic histidines in rnase a or t <dig>  <cit>  could be accounted for quantitatively by the  <dig> to  <dig> higher pka of tyrosine compared to histidine.

while our data support the roles of the h <dig> and y <dig> as a general acid/general base catalytic pair, they do not unambiguously define which residue serves as the general acid or the general base. such an assignment has proven challenging for rnases and ribozymes, even when high-resolution cocrystal structures with substrate analogs or products were available  <cit> . at present, we cannot formally distinguish between the two plausible mechanisms for rna cleavage by ire <dig> shown in figure 3c. as we argue below, the scheme shown in the left panel appears more compatible with steric considerations upon docking an rna stem-loop in ire <dig> rnase.

our model suggests that the ire <dig> rnase active site is unique and does not superimpose with other structurally characterized rnases. however, the arrangement of the catalytic residues in ire <dig> and their interactions with the scissile phosphate resemble those in the active sites of ribonucleases t <dig> and a. by extension, we predict that the same mechanism applies to mammalian ire <dig> and rnase l, the ire <dig> homologue involved in the interferon response pathway, in which all relevant residues discussed here for ire <dig> are strictly conserved.

a possible mechanism of stem-loop rna recognition by ire <dig> rnase
the crystal structure of trnaphe  shows the stem-loop in a conformation that would preclude cleavage by ire <dig> . the rna cleavage reaction imposes strict stereochemical requirements such that an incoming nucleophile can attack the phosphate in line with the leaving group. a similar stereochemical problem was encountered in studies of sarcin/ricin gaga tetraloop cleavage by ribonucleases α-sarcin and restrictocin. a cocrystal structure of restrictocin with the sarcin/ricin stem-loop rna suggested that scissile bases should undergo base flipping to position the incoming 2'oh in the 2'-endo conformation and to allow for in-line attack during catalysis  <cit> . guided by this concept, we searched the pdb database for a trnaphe structure, in which the loop guanosine at position  <dig> is flipped out such that its ribose ring adopts the 2'-endo conformation. we found that the crystal structure of trnaphe complexed with the trna modifying enzyme miaa  <cit>  serves as a suitable model .

accordingly, we used the stem-loop from the trnaphe·miaa structure for rigid-body docking into ire <dig> active site. as a restraint, we placed the scissile phosphate into the strongest electron density peak  and the rest of the loop to allow sterically permissible interactions expected from the cleavage mechanism  in figure 3c. the docked model has no backbone intersections or clashes of backbone atoms. by contrast, cleavage mechanism  could not be satisfied using this docking approach due to seemingly irresolvable interchain clashes. the resulting model predicts that only one stem-loop can bind to the ire <dig> rnase dimer and that one rnase domain in the dimer cleaves rna, whereas the other rnase monomer completes the rna-contacting surface in trans, suggesting that both rnase monomers and both hles participate in recognition of the rna stem-loop structure .

our model that the hle of one rnase monomer contributes to rna cleavage by the catalytic center of a different rnase monomer is functionally supported by the in trans complementation assay described above . this experiment demonstrates that cleavage by the active site of an rnase monomer is impaired upon removal of an rna binding residue from an adjacent, non-catalytic monomer. therefore, although ire <dig> rnase has individual per-monomer catalytic centers, two rnase monomers are involved in rna cleavage and apparently form a composite rna binding surface created via dimerization. the high-order oligomerization of ire <dig> completes the active site by stabilizing the highly dynamic hle  <cit>  in a conformation suitable for recognition of cognate rna stem-loops. this mechanism could explain how self-assembly of ire <dig> into an oligomer activates the rnase function.

ire <dig> cleavage of the trnaphe anticodon loop
we found that, strikingly, ire <dig> can recognize and cleave the anticodon stem/loop structure of trnaphe in addition to the cognate splice site stem-loops of hac <dig> and xbp <dig> mrna. this observation redefines the known substrate specificity of ire <dig> and suggests that additional stem-loops besides consensus sites in hac <dig> and xbp <dig> mrna could be cleaved by ire <dig> rnase. whether trnaphe is an in vivo substrate of ire <dig> remains to be investigated. in principle, trna destruction could serve to reduce the cell's translational capacity and thereby reduce protein influx into the er, akin to protein kinase-like er kinase  activation in metazoan cells. however, the scissile guanine in the anticodon of trnaphe carries a post-transcriptional 2'-methoxy modification  <cit> , which precludes cleavage of the modified trnaphe pool by any rnase producing 2',3'-cyclic phosphate, such as ire <dig>  leaving only the unmodified pool as a possible substrate. it is tempting to speculate that the trna modification evolved to protect trnaphe from cleavage by ire <dig> and that regulation of the methylated pool of trnaphe could provide a control point by which ire <dig> may affect the translational capacity of cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we investigated the mechanism of rna cleavage by ire <dig> rnase by combining computational, structural and quantitative biochemical approaches. this work experimentally determined the location of the catalytic center in ire <dig> rnase and converged on a model of docking and cleavage of cognate rna stem-loops. histidine h <dig> was defined as a key catalytic residue that is required in single copy in the twofold symmetric active site of the ire <dig> rnase. presented here in trans mutagenesis studies using  and  ire <dig> mutants, as well as electron density-guided in silico docking of an rna hairpin with the scissile bond correctly aligned for catalysis suggest that the hles of two ire <dig> monomers participate in stem-loop binding. this model intuitively predicts that only one rna stem-loop binds to the dimer of ire <dig> at a time  whereas the high-order oligomerization of ire <dig> enhances rna recognition via allosteric stabilization of the hle  <cit> . these findings identify the link between oligomerization of ire <dig> and recognition of cognate rna stem-loops, providing a glimpse of the central event in ire <dig> signaling.
