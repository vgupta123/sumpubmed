BACKGROUND
dagginess  and internal nematode parasites, are major animal health traits with ethical and welfare implications of interest to the new zealand sheep industry. firstly, dagginess has a known association with flystrike   <cit> , with the majority of flystrike occurring in the breech. secondly, internal parasites are increasingly becoming resistant to anthelmintic drenches; there is known resistance to all major classes of anthelmintics  <cit> . finally, there is a perception that internal parasite load is associated with level of dagginess. breeding to reduce level of dagginess and internal parasite load as measured by faecal egg counts is a strategy that can provide cumulative and permanent progress.

dagginess and parasite resistance, as measured by faecal egg counts of strongyle  and nematodirus egg count , have been shown to be moderately heritable traits  <cit> , with estimates in new zealand sheep of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for dag score at three and eight months  and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for fec/nem traits  <cit> . dagginess and fec/nem are often thought to be genetically associated in sheep. however, recent estimates showed that genetic and phenotypic correlations between fec/nem and dagginess traits  were low to zero in new zealand sheep  <cit> . a subsequent study also showed that dagginess was not correlated with wool length, bulk or type  <cit> . this does not rule out the immune response to worm burden irrespective to fec/nem as a cause of dagginess, but does suggest that the cause is internal and may involve processes within the intestinal tract.

traditional genome-wide linkage studies which find quantitative trait loci  associated with a trait of interest has been used successfully in animal production  <cit> . the sequencing of many domesticated species: e.g. cattle, chicken and sheep, have allowed the introduction of high-density snp genotyping platforms. these involve thousands and for some species hundreds of thousands of snps approximately equally spaced across the genome, to capture the greatest amount of linkage disequilibrium with causative qtl. this has produced rapid progress in genome-wide association studies  which have already identified regions associated with production  <cit> , fertility  <cit> , disease  and polledness  <cit>  traits in cattle and sheep.

the same platforms have given rise to marker assisted selection on a genome-wide scale, called genomic prediction or selection  <cit> . the sum of the effect each snp has on a trait is used to predict the animals’ molecular breeding values   <cit> . thus potentially all the genetic variation for a trait could be picked up by the snp panel due to the extent of ld between the snps on the panel and causative qtl. the dairy industry has already adopted gp to increase genetic gain  <cit> , and it has been recently implemented in the new zealand sheep industry  <cit> .

a resource consisting of greater than  <dig> m pedigree recorded animals, born between  <dig> and  <dig> from  <dig> industry recorded flocks, with estimated breeding values  for a number of production traits, including dag <dig>  dag <dig> and fec in summer , autumn  and as adult , was available for use. of these,  <dig> have been genotyped on the illumina ovine snp50beadchip . the aim of this study was to estimate the accuracy of mbvs for these traits, using genomic blup, which assumes all snps have a small effect and are normally distributed. a second aim was to use the snp effects generated from the genomic prediction analysis to identify regions associated with these traits, in a gwas.

RESULTS
quality control
a step by step quality control pipeline was performed  <cit> . from the initial set of  <dig>  useable snps,  <dig> were not retained by the ovine hapmap  <cit>  and a further  <dig> snps were discarded due to one or more of the following; non-autosomal , minor allele frequency  =  <dig>  call frequency < <dig>  and illumina quality score  value < <dig> . the final dataset included  <dig> animals and  <dig>  snps.

summary of dependent variables
of the  <dig> m animals used for ebv estimation there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  raw measurements for dag <dig> and dag <dig>  respectively. the traits fec <dig>  and fec <dig>  are repeatable traits with two samples  potentially collected at each time point, several days apart . for afec, this trait is not recorded and the ebvs are generated using estimated genetic and phenotypic correlations with other traits including fec <dig> and fec <dig>  table  <dig> summarizes the raw measurements used by sheep improvement limited , the new zealand sheep genetic evaluation database, to generate the ebvs and the resulting dependent variables  used for molecular breeding value  calculation; i.e. are parent averaged de-regressed, have reliabilities greater or equal to  <dig>  times the heritability and were for animals genotyped on the 50k snp chip. there were between  <dig> and  <dig> animals for each trait with y values; corresponding reliabilities were between  <dig>  and  <dig> .table  <dig> summary of raw phenotypes, de-regressed dependent variables with parent average removed and reliabilities

the dependent variables were split into a training and validation datasets, based on birth year, for the genomic prediction and to estimate accuracy of the prediction equations. this was performed for each breed  and trait . training set cut offs were chosen to ensure adequate numbers were in the training and validation datasets, see methods for a complete description.table  <dig> the year of birth of the first animals placed in the validation set and number  of animals in training and validation sets for each breed

principal component analysis
using the g <dig> matrix, described by vanraden  <cit> , the first six principal components  using the animals in the training set were calculated. the six pcs accounted for between  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the genetic variation contained in the genomic relationship matrix for each trait . in fig.  <dig>  the first  and second  largest axes of variation are plotted using the animals with fec <dig> y values. the distinction of the four main breed groups , with the three composites breeds  clustered in-between, are shown clearly and is typical of the new zealand sheep industry.table  <dig> the genetic variance explained by the first  <dig> principal components for each trait

accuracy of genomic prediction
the accuracies of the five traits calculated as the adjusted weighted correlation between mbv and y  and as the weighted average individual accuracy  are shown in table  <dig>  these were calculated using the animals in the validation set. for the dagginess traits the ra ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for those breeds in the training set and ri ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> . the perendales had the lowest ra and ri reflecting the low number of animals from this breed in the training set; n =  <dig> and  <dig> for dag <dig> and dag <dig>  respectively . for the three breeds present in the validation set only  ra and ri were poor for the texel who are the furthest removed from the validation set. the two composites have more than  <dig> % of their genetic background from romney, coopworth or perendale breeds and had accuracies close to values seen by the breeds represented in the training set.table  <dig> accuracies as the weighted correlation between mbv and dependent variable  and the weighted average individual accuracy  calculated for the five traits in the seven validation breeds

for the fec traits, the ra ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for those breeds represented in the training set and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for ri. the perendales again had the lowest accuracies; the number of animals of this breed in the training set were low . the composite  also had a low number of animals in the training set for fec <dig> and afec,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the slightly higher accuracies seen for comprcp compared to the perendales may be due to the comprcp animals consisting of at least  <dig> % romney, coopworth and/or perendale. again, of the breeds represented only in the validation sets, the texel had the lowest ra and ri except for afec, where comprcpt had a ra of − <dig> . adult fec had lower accuracies for most breeds compared to fec <dig> and fec <dig>  this is probably a reflection of the lower numbers of animals available with y values for this trait, which in turn is due to this trait being indirectly predicted from correlated traits.

the accuracies were compared to the theoretical accuracies using equation  <dig> from goddard  <cit> , following the assumptions of an effective population size  of  <dig> , number of records available per trait and genome length of 30m. the theoretical accuracies were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for dag <dig> and dag <dig> respectively and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for fec <dig>  fec <dig> and afec, respectively. the accuracy estimates obtained in this study are higher than those calculated theoretically. the reason for the higher accuracies is that the theoretical values are for ‘unrelated’ animals i.e. ~ <dig> generations or more distant. in practice, most of the validation animals have an ancestor 1– <dig> generations distant in the training data set and as such will have higher estimated accuracies than expected from theory.

simulations showed that when there are limited numbers of animals from one population set, then the most accurate genomic predictions are generated when information from all populations are combined in the training set rather than predicting separately by population  <cit> . however, the more genetically diverse the populations are, the less accurate are the genomic predictions for across breed analysis. this corroborates the low accuracy for the texels in this analysis, as they are the most divergent breed in the validation set compared to those present in the training set. the texels originated from texel an island offshore from the netherlands, while the romneys were from england, their estimated divergence is  <dig> to  <dig> generations ago  <cit> . to increase accuracies for texels, more animals are required so that some may be combined in the training set. this may in part be achieved by increasing the number of composites with at least  <dig> % texel, if pure-breds are hard to collect.

the accuracies for the comprcpt and compcrp are higher than expected for a breed not present in the training set, however, they are at least  <dig> % and at least 30– <dig> %, respectively, of the breeds represented in the training set. the strength of the genetic relationships between individuals and breeds was shown in the principal component analysis, e.g. for fec <dig> .

implementation in industry in new zealand for these traits currently uses the mbvs as described here with minor modifications  <cit> . these are then blended with ebvs calculated on all available animals .

gwas
the quantile-quantile  plots  showed that the deviation of the majority of observed -log <dig> values from the expected values was insignificant . the snps seen to be deviating from the expected values were interpreted as snps associated with the trait of interest, as the snps are departing from the null hypothesis of no genetic association and no ld between snps. there were  <dig> regions associated with dag <dig>  dag <dig>  fec <dig>  fec <dig> and/or afec with a p value <  <dig>  .fig.  <dig> quantile-quantile plot for dag score at three  and eight months , faecal egg count in summer , autumn  and as adult . the 0– <dig> line  and the slope  are also plotted



figure  <dig>  show the manhattan plots of the resulting -log <dig> values for dag <dig> and fec <dig>  respectively. the manhattan plot for dag <dig> was similar to dag <dig>  and plots for fec <dig> and afec were similar to fec <dig> . a summary of genes underlying the top snps with a p value <  <dig>  for each trait is in additional file  <dig>  for dag <dig> and dag <dig> there was one peak common to both traits detected on oar <dig> , comprising of a single snp . annotation on ovine genome v <dig>   showed there are no known genes or proteins within 100kbp window of this snp. two predicted genes were observed , however rna-seq data at ensembl does not provide supporting evidence for these genes being real. the 100kbp sequence was scanned for open reading frames in all  <dig> frames, these were matched against a collection of protein signature databases using interproscan  <dig>  <cit> . this identified three matching domains; integrin beta subunit, insulin-like growth factor binding protein and agouti .fig.  <dig> manhatten plot of -log <dig> values of snps for dag score at eight months  and faecal egg count in summer . ordered on the ovine genome v <dig> map, p <  <dig>  , p <  <dig>  

fig.  <dig> distribution of -log <dig> values for dag score at three  and eight months  and faecal egg count in summer , autumn  and as adult  for candidate regions on oar  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> 



for the fec traits there were two distinguishable similarities on oar  <dig> and  <dig> . on oar  <dig> there was a notable peak consisting of  <dig> snps in total for all three traits, spanning a  <dig>  mbp region , with the top snp within this region passing the p < 10− <dig> threshold for fec <dig> . on oar  <dig> there was one significant peak , with a p value ranging between  <dig>  × 10− <dig> and  <dig>  × 10− <dig> for fec <dig>  fec <dig> and afec.

the gene positioned under the peak on oar  <dig> is the vacuolar protein sorting  <dig> homolog c . this family of proteins are involved in the trafficking of membrane proteins between the trans-golgi network and the prevacuolar compartment  corresponding to the multivesicular body/late endosome in mammals  <cit> . four splice variants of this gene have been observed, along with three repeat regions. homolog c arose from duplication of homolog a, also known as chorein, which is involved in chorea-acanthocytosis , an autosomal recessive disease. however, homolog c cannot compensate for defunct homolog a in chac patients  <cit> . the vsp <dig> family of proteins are expressed in most tissues including the small intestine and colon  <cit> .

the gene positioned under the peak on oar  <dig> is the zeta-sarcoglycan  gene. this gene is involved in the formation of the sarcoglycan  complex with sgce, sgcb and sgcd in smooth muscle, retina and schwann cells  <cit> . the sg complex is part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex that interacts between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, essential for membrane stability. mutations in the sarcoglycans cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, with malfunctions of digestive smooth muscle leading to dysphagia, vomiting, chronic constipation and acute digestive dilatations. this region also overlaps with a copy number variant  region associated with obesity in mice  <cit> .

numerous studies have been carried out to investigate the genetic control of resistance to internal parasites. the majority of these studies involved microsatellite-based linkage studies . there are only a few more recent studies involving snp chip data  <cit> , one published study using both microsatellites and snps  <cit>  and one using candidate gene approach  <cit> . numerous traits representing parasite resistance have been used in these previous studies, for example, immunoglobulin a activity, packed cell volume and eosinophil counts, as well as the standard fec and nem traits. given this, of the  <dig> identified snps with a p <  <dig> , there were  <dig> regions which overlapped previous qtl/gwas studies on gastrointestinal parasites . notably the region on oar  <dig>  overlapped with four other studies  <cit> . a region on oar  <dig>  also overlapped or is near regions identified in five other studies  <cit> . four regions associated with dag <dig> and/or dag <dig> in this study were also identified in previous studies on gastrointestinal parasites . it has been reported in a comprehensive dataset that fec and dag score traits are not strongly genetically or phenotypically correlated, however, it was suggested that parasite worm burden could still play a role in faeces accumulation  <cit> . even though no similarities between significant regions were found between the two trait sets in this study, there may be similarities in the genes involved in the whole physiological response. it could be that the part of the response involved in reducing fec/pasture contamination is a different gene set from those involved in what leads to faecal accumulation. therefore, similarities between regions associated with dag score in this study and fec from previous studies could arise, relating to the physiological response to the parasitic infection.

CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that genomic prediction can be implemented for most breeds in the new zealand sheep industry for dagginess and fec traits. in addition, three regions have been identified, one on oar <dig> shows association with faecal accumulation and two regions  show an association with the fec traits. this study adds additional information in the quest for understanding the genes potentially involved in the host response to internal parasites and faecal accumulation.
