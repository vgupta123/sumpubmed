BACKGROUND
the defense regulator edm   <dig> was previously shown in col  accessions of arabidopsis thaliana  to be specifically required for immunity mediated by the disease resistance -gene rpp   <dig> against the hiks <dig> isolate of the pathogenic oomycete hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis   <cit> . unlike many other plant defense mechanisms rpp7-mediated immunity is independent from the defense hormone salicylic acid. furthermore, rpp7-mediated immunity appears thus far to be the only defense mechanism that edm <dig> is involved in, as no other edm2-dependent r-gene functions have been reported yet. edm <dig> also does not contribute to basal defense, a weaker non-specific plant immune response  <cit> . thus, the role of edm <dig> in plant defense seems to be restricted to a single or a limited number of defense pathways. the edm <dig> protein is nuclear-localized and bears typical features of transcription factors and epigenetic regulators, but does not belong to any established class of plant proteins controlling transcription  <cit> . consistent with a possible role in transcriptional regulation, edm <dig> seems to contribute to disease resistance by promoting transcription of rpp <dig>  <cit> .

we recently reported that a second function of edm <dig> is the regulation of flowering time, as edm <dig> mutants exhibit a delay in floral transition  <cit> . consistent with this phenotype, transcript levels of the negative flowering regulator gene flc  were substantially elevated in edm <dig> mutants. as theses edm <dig> phenotypes are independent from the photoperiod, edm <dig> may formally be considered as a member of the autonomous floral promotion pathway, which controls the floral transition by suppressing flc expression independent from day-length  <cit> .

edm <dig> interacts in nuclei with the wnk   <dig> protein kinase that can phosphorylate edm <dig>  <cit> . mutants of this kinase or wnk <dig> overexpressor lines, however, do not exhibit reduced immunity to hpahiks <dig>  but wnk <dig> mutants flower early  <cit> . double mutant analyses showed that edm <dig> is epistatic to wnk <dig>  similarly, flc proved to be epistatic to edm <dig>  thus, wnk <dig> may act upstream of edm <dig> in a regulatory module affecting the floral transition by modulating flc transcript levels  <cit> . in this model, wnk <dig> counteracts the promoting effect of edm <dig> on flowering.

here we report that besides its roles in immunity and the floral transition, edm <dig> has several additional functions in arabidopsis development, such as promoting vegetative leaf growth and leaf pavement cell morphology. wnk <dig> also has a promoting effect on these processes, suggesting that it participates in these edm <dig> functions. however, in contrast to its role in the floral transition, wnk <dig> seems not to counteract the function of edm <dig>  but to positively contribute to edm <dig> activity. overlapping transcript profiles of edm <dig> and wnk <dig> mutants support common biological roles of both regulators. in addition, edm <dig> seems to have a wnk8-independent role in a developmental process related to vegetative phase change. we propose that edm <dig> has multiple distinct regulatory functions related to developmental processes and defense. these edm <dig> functions differ with respect to their dependency on wnk <dig>  a possible function of wnk <dig> may be to fine-tune edm <dig> activity in some biological processes.

RESULTS
edm <dig> and wnk <dig> mutants exhibit a reduction in fresh weight
the transgenic arabidopsis line pxve:ha-edm2-a served as a key tool for our previous genetic analysis of edm <dig>  <cit> . this line contains in the edm2- <dig> mutant background the estradiol-inducible expression construct pxve:ha-edm <dig> encoding the ha epitope tag fused to the n-terminus of the full length edm <dig> protein. it exhibits near wild type edm <dig> and rpp <dig> transcript levels in the absence of estradiol  <cit> . furthermore, non-estradiol-treated pxve:ha-edm2-a plants flower like col- <dig> wild type plants and are fully resistant to hpahiks <dig>  indicating that un-induced expression of the pxve:ha-edm <dig> construct restores wild type edm <dig> function. therefore, we used non-estradiol-treated pxve:ha-edm2-a plants for all complementation experiments described in this study.

growing edm <dig> mutants beyond the seedling stage, we observed multiple distinct morphological phenotypes. by the time of bolting, edm <dig> plants appeared smaller due to reduced expansion of the rosette leaves and, consequently, exhibited a significant reduction in fresh weight . in pxve:ha-edm2-a plants, wild type growth is restored. mutants of the edm2-interacting kinase wnk <dig> also showed a reduction of leaf expansion and fresh weight. however, this effect was only significant in the wnk8- <dig> and wnk8- <dig> mutants and less pronounced in the wnk8- <dig> mutant, which, compared to wnk8- <dig> and wnk8- <dig>  seems to be a weak allele exhibiting a less pronounced reduction of wnk <dig> expression  <cit> .

edm <dig> and wnk <dig> mutants exhibit altered morphology of leaf pavement cells
we found the morphology of leaf pavement cells to be altered in edm <dig> plants. typically, the arabidopsis epidermis consists of interlocked "jigsaw-shaped" cells with protruding lobes and indentations  <cit> . epidermal cells of edm <dig> mutants are typically of simpler morphology often lacking lobes and indentations . to quantify this effect we measured the average circularity , of all cells within a defined leaf area. circularity is defined as c = 4pi Ã— . a perfect circle has a c value of  <dig> , while more complex or elongated shapes have lower c values due to decreased area:perimeter ratios . the pronounced jigsaw shapes of col- <dig> epidermis cells are reflected by particularly low c values between  <dig>  and  <dig> , while the more oval cells often found in edm <dig> epidermis have higher c values. as expected, we found the average c values of each of the four edm <dig> mutants to be significantly higher than those of their respective wild type controls . in pxve:ha-edm2-a plants wild type pavement cell morphology is restored.

mutations in wnk <dig> weakly affect the morphology of leaf pavement cells. like those of edm <dig> plants, leaf epidermal cells of wnk <dig> plants tend to be of simpler morphology often lacking lobes and indentations . although all three wnk <dig> mutants exhibit elevated circularity values of leaf epidermal cells compared to col- <dig>  the extent of this effect is weaker than in edm <dig> mutants and only significant in wnk8- <dig> . stable transformation of the wnk8- <dig> mutant with a wild type wnk <dig> transgene containing its native promoter  resulted in low circularity values of leaf pavement cells comparable to those in col- <dig> 

mutation of edm <dig> causes developmental effects related to vegetative phase change
in col- <dig> plants, the first two leaves are small and nearly perfectly round with smooth margins. however, edm <dig> plants typically form at this point in their development a pair of small leaves that are "spade-shaped" with slight serrations in the leaf margin . their shapes resemble the 2nd pair of leaves found in col- <dig>  but only the shape and not the size is affected. this morphological phenotype suggested altered vegetative phase change in edm <dig> plants. this developmental process, which is also known as heteroblasty, is defined by changes of leaf anatomy and morphology during the vegetative phase of plant ontogeny  <cit> . reminiscent of the known arabidopsis vegetative phase change mutants serrate , squint , hasty , zippy , suppressor of gene silencing  <dig>  and rna-dependent rna polymerase  <dig>   <cit>  the early juvenile phase of vegetative development seemed to be skipped in edm <dig> plants, which is manifested in an apparent omission of the first pair of regular rosette leaves .

in order to more accurately measure this effect in edm2- <dig>  we focused on the production of trichomes as a quantifiable marker of vegetative phase change  <cit> . arabidopsis leaves produced during the juvenile phase lack trichomes on their abaxial surface, while the adult phase starts gradually with the production of abaxial trichomes. in col- <dig> wild type plants, the onset of abaxial trichome production occurred in leaf  <dig> or  <dig>  whereas this phase transition was clearly delayed in edm2- <dig> plants . in contrast, the development of leaves with abaxial trichomes was accelerated in the known phase change mutants rdr <dig> and se . thus vegetative phase change seems rather to be delayed in edm2- <dig> and edm <dig> appears to have a promoting role in this developmental transition. the morphological appearance of early edm <dig> leaves, which suggested the opposite, may not be related to vegetative phase change and may reflect the role of edm <dig> in leaf pavement cell development . both, the morphological phenotype of early edm <dig> leaves and the delayed development of abaxial trichomes are complemented in pxve:ha-edm2-a plants . none of the three wnk <dig> mutant alleles or three independent wnk <dig> overexpressor lines, which exhibited clear flowering time phenotypes  <cit> , showed any alterations of the leaf morphology and the vegetative phase transition .

in summary, edm <dig> is involved in multiple processes that affect distinct aspects of vegetative development, such as vegetative growth, the shape of leaf epidermis cells, and the phase of vegetative leaves. in each case, edm <dig> acts as a positive regulator promoting the respective wild type processes. furthermore, our data suggest that edm <dig> and wnk <dig> act together in mechanisms promoting vegetative growth and epidermal cell development in leaves. as we did not observe any effect of wnk <dig> mutants or wnk <dig> overexpressor lines related to vegetative phase change  or edm2/rpp <dig> mediated pathogen resistance  <cit> , this protein kinase seems only to contribute to a subset of edm <dig> functions.

edm <dig> and wnk <dig> have overlapping and co-directional effects on the transcriptome
to assess interactions between edm <dig> and wnk <dig> at the transcriptome level, we profiled transcript patterns of untreated col- <dig>  edm2- <dig>  pxve:ha-edm2-a, wnk8- <dig>  wnk8- <dig>  and wnk8- <dig> seedlings using affymetrix ath <dig> whole genome arrays. for each genotype, signal intensities from three independent biological replicates were averaged and genes identified that were differentially expressed in the edm <dig> or wnk <dig> mutants compared to either col- <dig> or pxve:ha-edm2-a . based on these data, we defined six primary sets of edm <dig> or wnk <dig> target genes  and derived six additional secondary sets of their targets . gene sets  <dig> and  <dig> as well as the secondary gene sets are also represented in figure  <dig>  the sets "edm <dig> induced" and "edm <dig> suppressed"  include genes whose transcript levels in edm2- <dig> compared to col- <dig> are significantly lower or higher, respectively. the  <dig> genes of these two sets represent all genes we found to be differentially affected by edm <dig>  the more stringently defined sets "core edm <dig> induced" and "core edm <dig> suppressed"  are limited to those genes whose transcript levels, in addition to being differential in edm2- <dig>  are reversed to wild type levels in pxve:ha-edm2-a plants. as expected, the edm <dig> target gene flc  <cit>  is included in the sets "edm <dig> suppressed" and "core edm <dig> suppressed". rpp <dig> is not represented on the ath <dig> array.

"wnk <dig> induced" and "wnk <dig> suppressed"  represent genes whose transcript levels in each of the three wnk <dig> mutants compared to col- <dig> are significantly lower or higher, respectively. the  <dig> genes of these two sets represent all genes we found to be consistently expressed differentially in all three wnk <dig> mutants. although this complement of wnk <dig> target genes  is more stringently defined than the complement of the edm <dig> target genes , the former is almost twice as large as the latter, suggesting that wnk <dig> may have a wider spectrum of biological roles than edm <dig>  more than a third  of the  <dig> genes differentially regulated by edm <dig>  are also differentially regulated by wnk <dig> . strikingly, all of these  <dig> genes commonly controlled by edm <dig> and wnk <dig> are affected by these two regulators in the same manner, as  <dig> of them are edm <dig> and wnk <dig> suppressed, while the remaining  <dig> are edm <dig> and wnk <dig> induced . this strict co-directionality of edm <dig> and wnk8-dependent transcriptional changes indicates a close functional connection between both regulators and is consistent with the physical interactions between them  <cit>  as well as the fact that they affect a common set of biological processes.

in order to infer possible molecular and/or biological processes controlled commonly by edm <dig> and wnk <dig> or exclusively by each of these two regulators individually we used the "amigo" program http://amigo.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/amigo/term_enrichment to identify overrepresented gene ontology  terms in gene sets  <dig> -  <dig> . as shown in table  <dig>  edm <dig> and wnk <dig> commonly promote expression of genes involved in metabolic processes as well as genes responsive to various stimuli, such as stress, temperature, chemicals and other abiotic cues . similar themes are found in the sets of genes exclusively and not commonly controlled by edm <dig> and wnk <dig>  while the set of "only edm2-induced" genes is enriched for genes involved in catalytic activity , the set of "only wnk8-induced" genes includes genes responsive to a variety of stimuli, such as stress, temperature, chemicals and abiotic cues . thus, the roles of edm <dig> and wnk <dig> appear to be partially independent of each other. however, both regulators seem to cooperate regarding a subset of their functions. interestingly, edm <dig> appears to suppress a small set of genes responsive to biotic stimuli and other organisms . this set includes lurp _ <dig> and acd   <dig>  which we previously found to be hpa-inducible by an edm <dig> dependent mechanism  <cit> . hence, edm <dig> seems to be involved in the hpa-responsive activation of a small set of defense genes as well as their suppression in the absence of hpa.

discussion
this study together with data already published  <cit>  show that the arabidopsis defense regulator edm <dig> has multiple additional roles in development. its roles are diverse and besides innate immunity, include other apparently unrelated processes, such as development of leaf pavement cells, vegetative phase change as well as control of floral transition.

edm <dig> is involved in several regulatory modules
edm <dig> acts together with wnk <dig> in controlling the floral transition, while wnk <dig> appears not to have any role in edm2/rpp7-mediated disease resistance to hpahiks <dig>  <cit> . thus, an edm2/wnk8-dependent mechanism controls flowering time while a second edm2-dependent mechanism that seems not to involve wnk <dig> mediates resistance to hpahiks <dig>  related to the latter regulatory circuit may be the vegetative phase change-related function of edm <dig>  which is also affected in edm <dig> mutants but not in wnk <dig> mutants or wnk <dig> overexpressor lines. other roles of edm <dig>  such as those in vegetative growth and development of leaf epidermal cells may represent a third category of edm2-dependent regulatory mechanisms, as they seem to involve wnk <dig>  in contrast to the floral transition, however, which is promoted by edm <dig> and counteracted by wnk <dig>  vegetative growth and epidermal cell morphology are affected in the same manner by edm <dig> and wnk <dig>  which both positively contribute to these developmental processes. thus, at least three distinct edm2-dependent regulatory modules that differ in their dependency on and interactions with wnk <dig> can be discriminated .

effects of edm <dig> and wnk <dig> on leaf pavement cell morphology and vegetative growth
both edm <dig> and wnk <dig> positively contribute to proper development of leaf pavement cells as well as overall vegetative growth. in each case, mutations in edm <dig> have a stronger impact on the respective phenotype than mutations in wnk <dig>  despite having qualitatively similar effects on leaf pavement cells and vegetative growth, we cannot exclude that edm <dig> and wnk <dig> independently contribute to these developmental processes. fu et al.  <cit>  found the "jigsaw-like" appearance of arabidopsis leaf pavement cells to result from the coordinated interplay of the small rho-type gtpases rop <dig>  and rop <dig> and their interacting partners ric <dig>  and ric <dig>  in addition, angustifolia has been found to mediate the formation of protrusions in arabidopsis leaf cells  <cit> . however, transcript levels of these developmental regulators appear not to be altered by mutations in edm <dig> or wnk <dig> in our microarray experiments. thus, edm <dig> and wnk <dig> may either affect transcript levels of other components of the respective regulatory pathways or affect them by playing roles other than transcriptional regulation.

besides changes of epidermal cell morphology, mutations in edm <dig> also impact the overall size and morphology of rosette leaves, which are less expanded in edm <dig> plants compared to col- <dig> resulting in a reduced fresh weight of these mutants. this phenotype may be a consequence of the altered leaf pavement cell shape. several examples indicate causal links between abnormal development of leaf cell morphology and leaf organogenesis  <cit>  and mutations in angustifolia or rop <dig> also result in more narrow rosette leaves  <cit> . the reduction of leaf size and fresh weight in wnk <dig> mutants is less pronounced than in edm <dig> mutants. consistent with this, their leaf pavement cell phenotype is also less pronounced compared to edm <dig> mutants.

vegetative phase change-related function of edm2
while rpp7-mediated resistance to hpahiks <dig> is strongly dependent on edm <dig>  <cit> , this immune response appears not to require wnk <dig>  similarly, the vegetative phase change-related phenotype of edm <dig> mutants appears to be absent in any of the wnk <dig> mutants or wnk <dig> overexpressor lines. thus, the roles of edm <dig> in rpp7-mediated resistance and vegetative phase change appear to be distinct from its roles in the control of flowering time, leaf pavement cell development and vegetative growth. a pathway for the biogenesis of trans-acting sirnas involving hasty, zippy, sgs <dig> and rdr <dig> has been implicated in the control of early vegetative phase change in arabidopsis. however, neither transcript levels of these genes nor of five genes that seem to be controlled by this pathway   <cit>  appear to be affected by edm <dig> in our microarray experiments. thus, involvement of edm <dig> in this sirna pathway seems unlikely.

edm2/wnk8-dependent regulation of floral transition
we previously found edm <dig> and wnk <dig> to operate in a regulatory module controlling flowering time  <cit> . edm <dig> has a promoting effect on this developmental transition, while wnk <dig> appears to counteract this edm <dig> function. given their antagonistic effects on the floral transition, the co-directionality of edm <dig> and wnk8-dependent transcriptome changes seems counter-intuitive. however, our microarray analyses were performed with vegetative tissues prior to the floral induction. thus, transcriptional effects caused by edm2- or wnk8-modulated flc activity should not be represented in our microarray data set.

as we describe previously  <cit> , the role of edm <dig> in promoting the floral transition by suppressing the floral repressor flc in a photoperiod-independent manner resembles that of the well-characterized autonomous floral promotion pathway  <cit> . so far seven regulatory genes have been associated with this pathway, fca , fy , flk , fpa , fld , fve  and ld   <cit> . we did not observe in our microarray experiments differential effects on the transcript levels of any autonomous pathway gene in edm2- <dig> ruling out that edm <dig> affects this pathway simply by controlling the expression of one of its known components. a role of edm <dig> as a member of the autonomous pathway is further supported by our microarray data, which revealed substantial overlap between transcriptional signatures of the fpa/fld double mutant  <cit>  as well as the edm <dig> and wnk <dig> mutants . the fact that autonomous pathway mutants  exhibit delayed vegetative phase change is also consistent with the proposed function of edm <dig> as a new component of this floral promotion pathway  <cit> .

co-option of edm <dig> to distinct regulatory processes
according to whole genome sequences available from genbank http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi, edm2-like proteins  appear to have originally evolved from a common ancestor of land plants, as they are present in eudicots, monocots and bryophytes, but are lacking in prokayotes, green algae, fungi, protozoans or metazoans. while key mechanisms of plant development must have emerged early in the lineage of land plants, the acquisition of specific mechanisms of pathogen recognition and defense activation are likely more recent events resulting from co-evolution of higher plants along with pathogens adapting to their hosts  <cit> . thus, we believe that at least some of the developmental roles of edm <dig> reflect more ancient functions than its role in defense. thus, edm <dig> as a regulator of some developmental processes may have been co-opted to control additional functions including defense. co-option, the recruitment of extant genes to new functions  <cit> , often involves the utilization of new promoter elements leading to a wider spectrum of expression and, consequently, deployment of the respective gene products into new regulatory or metabolic contexts. alternatively, new domains can be added to an extant protein enabling it to execute new molecular roles in addition to its ancestral functions. of interest in this respect may be the c-terminal extension of edm <dig>  which we found to act as a potent transcriptional activation domain . this c-terminal extension is only present in elp family members of the eudicot clade  <cit> . thus, the relatively recent acquisition of the c-terminal extension may be responsible for a widened functional spectrum of edm <dig>  future studies will have to address if edm <dig> orthologs that lack this domain have a reduced set of edm2-related roles.

at least some edm <dig> functions must be occurring simultaneously in the same cell types. edm <dig> and wnk <dig> transcripts are detectable in all aerial vegetative tissues as well as in the shoot apex during and after the floral transition . as most vegetative aerial arabidopsis tissues appear to be capable of defense responses to hpa  <cit> , roles of edm <dig> in immunity are likely to spatially coincide with its roles in vegetative phase change or leaf pavement cell development and vegetative growth. co-option of edm <dig> to multiple simultaneous functions may reflect an important adaptation allowing for crosstalk between apparently unrelated biological processes. for example, limited amounts of cellular edm <dig> protein may constitute a "regulatory bottleneck" enabling the plant to balance the allocation of its resources between defense responses and different developmental processes.

additionally, as discussed elsewhere  <cit> , edm2-dependent developmental processes may be manipulated by biotrophic pathogens, such as hpahiks <dig>  a typical feature of pathogens that are well adapted to their hosts is the use of effector molecules, which they secrete into host cells to increase pathogen virulence. such effectors or virulence factors can attenuate host defense processes or change plant metabolism or development  <cit>  in order to generate a more favorable environment for the pathogen in the host. often plants have evolved mechanisms to recognize effector-mediated interferences with their regulatory apparatus to activate strong immune responses  <cit> . a similar scenario may explain the involvement of edm <dig> in developmental and immune processes.

CONCLUSIONS
besides rpp7-mediated immunity, edm <dig> positively affects several developmental processes which include the formation of leaf pavement cells, leaf expansion, a role related to vegetative phase change as well as floral transition. these edm2-dependent processes differ with respect to their dependency on the edm2-interating protein kinase wnk <dig>  while wnk <dig> seems not to affect the vegetative phase change-related role of edm <dig>  it has a promoting effect on the development of leaf pavement cells and leaf expansion. the fact that the effects of edm <dig> and wnk <dig> on leaf pavement cell formation and leaf expansion are co-directional, while wnk <dig> counteracts the promoting effect of edm <dig> on the floral transition suggests that wnk <dig> can modulate the activity of edm <dig>  thus, we propose that edm <dig> has been co-opted to distinct regulatory modules controlling a set of different processes in plant immunity and development. some functions of these edm <dig> functions appear to be modulated by wnk <dig>
