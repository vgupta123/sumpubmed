BACKGROUND
cowpea, vigna unguiculata l. walp., is both one of the most important food and forage legumes in the semi-arid tropics and a valuable and dependable commodity for farmers and grain traders  <cit> . of the ~ <dig> million acres grown worldwide, 80% of cowpea production takes place in the dry savannah of tropical west and central africa, mostly by poor subsistence farmers in developing countries  <cit> . despite its economic and social importance in the developing world, cowpea has received relatively little attention from a research standpoint and remains to a large extent an underexploited crop. among the major goals of cowpea breeding and improvement programs is the stacking of desirable agronomic traits, such as those governing abiotic stress  tolerance, photoperiod sensitivity, plant growth type, and seed quality with resistances to the numerous bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases and insect, invertebrate , and herbivorous pests  <cit> . implementation of marker assisted selection and breeding programs is severely limited by a paucity of trait-linked markers and a general lack of information on gene structure and organization. thus, relatively large genetic gains can likely be made with only modest investments in both applied plant breeding and molecular genetics.

the leguminosae  family consists of  <dig> genera and over  <dig>  species  <cit> . diversification commenced soon after the first identifiable legumes appeared in the fossil record ~ <dig> million years ago , and all living legumes are thought to share a common ancestor that existed an estimated ~ <dig> mya  <cit> . the family is divided into several major clades  <cit> , with most of the major crop and model species concentrated in the papilionoideae clades "halogalegina"  and "phaseoloid/millettioids" . cowpea belongs to the latter clade, along with the other major warm-season crops: common bean , pigeon pea , and soybean   <cit> . the split between glycine and medicago is dated at ~ <dig> mya and that between glycine and phaseolus at ~ <dig> mya  <cit> .

the most significant progress in legume genomics has been made for the small genome model species, m. truncatula and l. japonicus, and for soybean , economically the most important legume crop species  <cit> . large expressed sequence tag  collections are available for all three of these species  <cit> , along with near complete genome sequences and well-developed genetic and physical maps  <cit> . the availability of genomics level information lags substantially in other legumes, although some progress has been made in pea , common bean , alfalfa , and peanut   <cit> .

little attention has been paid to gene characterization and the development of resources in cowpea  <cit>  despite the fact that its genome size of  <dig> mb is one of the smallest among the legumes and is at the lower end of plant genomes in general  <cit> . at the time of writing, fewer than  <dig>  cowpea ests have been deposited in public databases  <cit>  and most of the genomic dna sequence available relates to either rrna coding and spacer regions or represents anonymous sequence exploited for rflp mapping. increasing our knowledge of the structure and composition of the cowpea genome will help in the interpretation of genome evolution in this phaseoloid/millettoid clade and papilionoideae in general, and will undoubtedly contribute substantially to efforts aimed at improvement of this crop.

while advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies make the prospects of whole genome sequencing possible, for most plant species the associated cost still remains prohibitive because of their genome size and complexity. reduced-representation approaches, such as methylation filtration  and cot-based cloning and sequencing, have been developed to alleviate some of the difficulties presented by the presence of ubiquitous repetitive dna  <cit> . both techniques rely on gene enrichment for the recovery of genic sequences. while cot-based selection separates low-copy from high copy sequence based on differential annealing  <cit> , mf targets the hypomethylated fraction of the genome for cloning. the use of mf as an enrichment technique has been successfully demonstrated in maize, sorghum, soybean and tobacco  <cit> . empirical comparisons suggest that the relative efficacy of mf and cot-based enrichment the techniques is species dependent  <cit> . here we show how mf was successfully applied in cowpea for the enrichment of gene-rich regions and report a detailed analysis of the resulting recovered sequences.

RESULTS
sequencing the gene-rich space of cowpea sampled by mf
in order to determine whether the application of methylation filtration  technology could be used to enrich for hypomethylated gene-rich dna from cowpea, a pilot study was carried out in which two whole genome shotgun libraries were generated from nuclear genomic dna isolated from the cowpea variety ucr- <dig>  one library was made using the mcrbc- strain of e. coli  library) and the other was made using the mcrbc+ strain  library). nucleotide sequences were generated from one end of the inserted dna in randomly selected clones picked from the uf and mf libraries, resulting in  <dig>  and  <dig> sequence attempts, respectively . the gene enrichment or filter power  obtained was determined by comparison of the sequence reads from the uf and mf library clones to a highly-curated arabidopsis protein database from which transposons and other repetitive elements had been removed  <cit> . curation is an important step because it allows for the accurate determination of relative gene densities of the mf and uf sequence sets. match rates were calculated over a range of blast e values  for the various mf and uf sequence reads and the resulting fp achieved by mf was  <dig>  to  <dig> , with a median value of  <dig>  . given an estimated genome size of  <dig> mb, a  <dig> -fold enrichment predicts a hypomethylated, gene-rich space for cowpea of  <dig> mb, about the size of the arabidopsis genome. the enrichment following mf observed in cowpea was similar to the  <dig> -fold enrichment observed in soybean  and better than the  <dig> -fold enrichment found in phaseolus .

asequences from mf and uf libraries were compared to a highly-curated arabidopsis protein sequence database as described in  <cit> .

based on empirically derived results from the orion sorghum genethresherâ„¢ project and a simulation conducted on finished arabidopsis sequence  <cit> , we estimated that in order to sequence tag some portion of ~95% of the genes in the cowpea genome, it would be necessary to generate ~ <dig>  mf sequence reads of an average read length of ~ <dig> nucleotides  <cit> . this number depends heavily on the accuracy of the genome size estimate, and the probability that all genes lie within the sampled hypomethylated gene space. in the scaled-up version of the project, mf libraries were prepared from dna isolated from the african cowpea cultivar it97k-499- <dig> and  <dig>  random clones were sequenced  . in all,  <dig>  mf gene-space sequence reads  were generated, of which  <dig>  or  <dig> % were classified as successful sequencing attempts , viral or animal genomic dna). chloroplast , mitochondrial , and transponson/retrotransposon-like  dna sequences identified by blast  were also removed. in total, the gsr dataset provided  <dig> , <dig> nucleotides of raw sequence with the average length of a successful gsr being  <dig> nucleotides . all gsrs, including organellar genome-derived sequences, as well as information on individual gsr lengths and other statistical analyses are available for interested individuals  <cit> .

a successful reads were greater than  <dig> bp in length and did not match dna of extracellular  and organellar  origin when compared to available databases using blastx.

the  <dig>  successful gsrs were clustered and assembled  <cit>  into  <dig>  gsr assemblies  and  <dig>  singletons . relatively few singletons were generated by the assembly process indicating that the clustering of sequences was effective. the largest cluster  contains  <dig> contigs with  <dig>  members and the smallest cluster contains two gsrs. clusters  <dig> through  <dig> contain from  <dig> to  <dig> component gsrs. following assembly, the gsr dataset represents a nuclear coverage of ~ <dig> mb, which is equivalent to 52% of the sampled gene space and  <dig> % of the total cowpea genome.

gene annotation and gene ontology analysis
to assess the efficiency of gene discovery following mf, the fasta formatted cowpea gsrs were annotated and analyzed by both blast and hidden markov model -based algorithms  <cit> . the percentage of gsrs containing blast-identifiable gene sequences present in four public protein sequence databases and the proteomes of four completely or nearly completely sequenced plant genomes  was determined. as shown in table  <dig>  between 13% and 31% of the cowpea gsrs were annotated via the homology-based approach. combining all of the distinct annotated gsrs, approximately 36%  of total cowpea gsrs could be assigned a putative function.

to determine the number of unique gene sequences represented in our dataset, blast comparisons to the ncbi genbank peptide database  <cit>  performed using the  <dig>  grs assemblies and  <dig>  singletons resulted in the  <dig>  annotated sequences. of these annotated sequences,  <dig>  had distinct genbank accession numbers. by comparison,  <dig>  distinct genbank accession numbers were found by blast annotation of the  <dig>  gsrs prior to assembly. thus, the assembly process did not enhance or significantly compromise the identification of putative gene coding sequences.

the goal of reduced representation sequencing strategies such as mf is to capture as much gene complexity as possible without the laborious task of complete genome sequencing. most plant genomes are thought to encode between  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes  <cit> . in legumes, gene density is estimated to be  <dig> gene per 6â€“ <dig> kb  <cit> . with a gene space coverage of ~ <dig> mb captured by mf, the estimated minimum number of genes potentially tagged in our mf dataset should be between  <dig>  and  <dig> . in contrast to these predicted values, our annotation data clearly indicate that we tagged ~ <dig>  gene coding regions, representing a minimum of  <dig>  distinct genbank accession numbers. this latter number is also likely an underestimate, since we only included the single lowest e-value score per sequence. some of the sequences matched multiple genbank accession numbers and the second or third ranked e-values could represent additional coding regions on the same fragment.

to determine whether there was any bias in the enrichment for genes using mf, we made putative functional assignments for the individual gsrs based upon the most significant match obtained from database searches against the arabidopsis go annotation categories. as shown in figure  <dig>  the putative annotations were grouped into three top-level ontologies: cellular component, biological process, and molecular function. approximately 29%  of the cowpea gsrs could be annotated in this way. among those sequences that could be assigned a functional classification, the largest categories were catalytic activity and metabolic processes, groups that include the majority of cellular enzymes and components of amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. cellular binding activities  and gene products involved in cellular response to stimuli are among the second group of gene products. among the gsrs assigned molecular function by go annotation,  <dig>  gsrs  had homology to genes encoding transcription factors  and transcription associated factors . this value is similar to what was found by direct annotation of the gsr assemblies, in which ~5%  of the total annotated sequences have this putative function assignment.

comparisons to ests of cowpea and other legumes
to better estimate the quality of our gene discovery, we compared the cowpea gsrs to available consensus est-derived unigenes from cowpea and other legumes, including species closely and more distantly related . in our analysis, we used  <dig>  unigenes assembled from ~ <dig>  ests derived from root and leaf/stem transcripts of four different cowpea cultivars grown under both drought-stressed and well-watered conditions . approximately  <dig> % of cowpea ests-derived unigenes were represented in the gsr dataset as defined by blastn homology. since the cowpea ests and gsrs come from different cowpea cultivars, nucleotide sequences differences are expected and, therefore, we also performed comparisons at the protein level using tblastx. these comparisons indicated an ~90% match rate. while the total number of ests available from cowpea is admittedly low, the high hit rate is a strong indication that the gsrs provide a broad and robust coverage of genic sequence.

acomparisons between cowpea gsrs and est-derived unigenes were performed as describe in the materials and methods using tblastx, with the exception of comparison to the the cowpea est-derived unigenes where blastn was employed.

blast comparisons  of the consensus ests-derived unigenes from other legumes and the gsrs showed that  <dig> % of the unigenes from p. vulgaris matched cowpea sequences. this is not surprising since common bean and cowpea and phylogenetically very close. not surprisingly, ests-derived unigenes from the more distally related m. truncatula and l. japonicus only had match rates with cowpea of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the mean percentage of match for cowpea gsrs and available legume ests-derived unigenes was ~70%.

mapping cowpea gsrs to m. truncatula pseudomolecules
using tblastx searches,  <dig>  gsrs  could be mapped to the m. truncatula chromosome-scale pseudomolecules available on the tigr m. truncatula database  <cit> . the cowpea sequences are broadly distributed among the nine m. truncatula pseudomolecules . several examples of the mapping are shown in figure  <dig>  we were able to find over  <dig> cases where gsr assemblies/singletons map to at least  <dig> adjacent imgag genes along the pseudomolecules, indicating a significant level of microsynteny. we also found examples where along a syntenic region, there appears to be a gene missing in either cowpea or m. truncatula . this could be due to either a gene insertion/deletion in one of the species. it is unlikely to be due to an annotation error in m. truncatula, since tblastx would detect sequence similarity in this region even if no gene model was predicted.

analysis of transcription factor  families
plants devote ~7% of their genome coding capacity to proteins that regulate transcriptional activities  <cit> . analysis of completed plant genome sequences suggests that are upwards of  <dig> tf families present in most plant genomes. in arabidopsis  <cit>  and p. trichocarpa  <cit>  the  <dig> tf families vary in size from 1â€“ <dig> members to over  <dig> members. rice contains  <dig> of the dicot tf families  <cit> , missing only the sap <dig> family represented by only a single gene in both arabidopsis and p. trichocarpa. about  <dig> of the known tf families and ~ <dig> potentially novel plant tfs and tafs were identified in an in silico analysis of the m. truncatula genome using the medicago gene annotation group  dataset as starting material  <cit> . since ~5% of the cowpea gsrs showed some homology to known tf, we examined the distribution among the known tf families in vascular plants and in selected cases the complexity of cowpea tf families relative to what is found in other plant species.

blast homology searches were carried out using conserved domains for the  <dig> tf families previously defined in arabidopsis  <cit>  and tobacco  <cit> . one or more gene coding sequence for  <dig> of the  <dig> tf families previously identified in vascular plants could be identified in the cowpea gsr dataset, including sequences encoding the sap <dig> tf family. among the low copy tf families present in other plants, one member of each of the lfy, nzz, and ult families, two members of the ccaat-dr <dig> and whirly gene families, and  <dig> members of the lug and voz gene families were present. only the hrt-like and s1fa tf families were not represented among the cowpea gsrs.

the erf, wrky, and constans /constans-like  gene families were chosen for a more detailed analysis. these families are well characterized in other plant species and encode proteins that regulate a variety of plant developmental, stress, and growth responses. in arabidopsis and p. trichocarpa, the erf and wrky families are among the largest tf families present, and the co-like gene family has ~ <dig> members. however, the most important criteria for selecting these tf families for analysis was that the gene products contain short, well-conserved dna-binding domains that can be used to estimate diversity and phylogenetic relationships among family members, and to study gene family evolution  <cit> . significant comparative information is available for the co-like family in legumes  <cit> .

the erf family
erf transcription factors play important regulatory roles in plant responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses, sugar signaling, and determination of organ identity  <cit> . blast searches of the gsr dataset were based on a representative dna binding domain from each of the ten major erf subgroups   <cit>  using low stringency . the complete set of erf domain-containing gsrs was assembled into contigs, each sequence was manually verified and false positives removed. this approach ensured that all possible gene family members, including the most highly divergent ones, were isolated. as a result,  <dig> erf sequences were obtained, representing a minimum of  <dig> erf genes. the minimum number is lower than the total number because a small number of sequences contain incomplete dna-binding domains, and therefore some erf sequences may represent the 5' and 3' ends of the same gene. the predicted minimum number of erf gene family members present in cowpea  is similar to that predicted to be in the arabidopsis genome   <cit> .

the phylogenetic structure of the cowpea erf gene family  is similar to that of arabidopsis. two major clades are recognized, the erf and cbf/dreb subfamilies, consisting of the ten major subgroups. subgroup ix contains the largest number of genes and is divided into two branches. the placement of group v genes in cowpea differs significantly from what is observed in arabidopsis  <cit> , with the cowpea group v erfs forming separate branches in both the cbf/dreb and erf clades. this may be a more common feature of the erf family, since the group v genes of tobacco also form separate branches in both the cbf/dreb and erf clades  <cit> , and in rice, some group v genes cluster with group xi  <cit> .

the high degree of similarity in the phylogenetic arrangement of erf genes between cowpea and arabidopsis indicates that it should be possible to use such analyses to identify potential targets for cowpea improvement. we also constructed a phylogeny that contained the erfs of cowpea and those of other plant species whose biological function has been reported . using this type of analysis we were able to identify the closest cowpea homologues of cbf <dig>  dreb1a, tiny, capbf <dig>  orca <dig> and pti <dig>  erfs known to be regulators of important agronomical traits such as drought, salt tolerance, freezing tolerance, and disease and pest resistance .

the wrky family
the wrky tfs regulate responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, senescence, germination, and a number of developmental processes  <cit> . each wrky transcription factor contains at least one conserved ~ <dig> amino acids region  with the peptide sequence wrkygqk at the n-terminus and a zn-finger motif at its c-terminus  <cit> . the ancestral-type wrky tf  contains two wrky domains, one n-terminal and the other, c-terminal. all other genes contain just one wrky domain and are classified into groups iia, iib, iic, iid, iie and iii on the basis of their primary amino acid sequence and structure of their zn-finger motifs. a blast search of the cowpea gsrs was performed with each of the wrky domains from the various subgroups and with both the n-terminal and c-terminal domains from group i. a total of  <dig> contigs, containing at least part of a wrky domain, were obtained. discovery of wrky genes was technically more difficult than the erf genes because most wrky domains are interrupted by an intron separating the wrky and zn-finger parts of the domain. the effect of this intron was that frequently only the 5'- or 3'-end of the wrky domain was present in the assembled contigs. nevertheless, it was possible to estimate the minimum number  and maximum number  of wrky genes present to be,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. these values are consistent with the prediction of  <dig> wrky genes in arabidopsis  <cit> .

a phylogenetic tree of the cowpea wrky tfs based on their wrky domain sequence, and including some key arabidopsis wrky genes, was generated . this revealed that the organization of the gene family in cowpea is similar to that in arabidopsis, with the exception of the group iib genes that appear to fall into two distinct clades. this is likely an artifact caused by the presence of some truncated wrky domains in the analysis, because of all the genes found in the cluster designated iib*, only two  have full-length wrky domains.

cowpea homologs of functionally characterized wrky genes could also be identified. these include vuwrky <dig> and vuwrky <dig>  homologs of atwrky <dig>  a tf that functions at the intersection of salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signaling during defense responses  <cit> , vuwrky <dig>  a homolog of atwrky <dig>  whose product plays a role in regulating senescence  <cit> , and vuwrky <dig> and vuwrky <dig>  homologs of transparent testa glabra , which plays a key role in trichome and seed coat development  <cit> .

constans and the constans-like gene family
the timing of flowering is an important agronomic trait in crop plants  <cit> . many genes involved in photoperiod responsiveness are functionally conserved in monocot and dicot species  <cit> . as a result, it was possible for us to identify gsrs encoding many members of various gene families involved in light perception , as well as gsrs encoding components of the signal transduction pathways connecting photoperiod and phytohormonal stimuli in the induction of flowering. for example, the interaction between the products of the constans  and flowering locus t  genes underlie long- and short-day responsiveness  <cit> . co encodes a tf that plays a central role linking the circadian clock to genes controlling meristem identity  <cit> . co and members of the co-like gene family are defined by the presence of two conserved domains, a zn-finger domain that resembles a b-box domain near the n-terminus and a cct domain  <cit>  near the c-terminus  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the co-like gene family consists of three broad groups: group i which includes co and factors with two zn-finger b-boxes near the n-terminus, group ii with one b-box, and group iii with one b-box and a second diverged zn-finger. there is a surprising amount of disagreement in the literature about the number of co-like genes present in arabidopsis, with values ranging from  <dig>  <cit>  to between  <dig> â€“  <dig> genes  <cit> , due to variation among researchers in defining what constitutes a co-like gene. some researchers accept "co-like genes" that only contain a cct domain and but not a b-box. since cct domains are present in other tfs  and the b-box is a feature absolutely required for co function  <cit> , in our analysis we only considered those genes that fit the stricter definition . as a result,  <dig> cowpea co-like genes were identified.

the cowpea co-like gene family has several interesting features. two cowpea genes, vucol <dig> and vucol <dig>  clustering together within group i are clearly the closest homologs of the arabidopsis co, col <dig>  and col <dig> genes . their corresponding functional role is currently under investigation. the cowpea group ii and group iii co-like genes are similar in number to those in arabidopsis, whereas the group iiib, consisting of vucol <dig> to vuco <dig>  has no counterpart. two m. truncatula homologs of cowpea group iiib genes exist suggesting that perhaps this branch is legume specific. four co-like genes are known in monocots  that similarly contain only a single b-box domain  <cit> . the functional role of these group iiib co-like genes in cowpea remains to be elucidated.

vernalization acts to promote flowering by repressing the expression of another floral regulator, the mads-domain protein termed flowering locus c  in arabidopsis. cereals appear to be missing flc-like genes in their genomes, with the corresponding role being carried out by an unrelated zn-finger tf  <cit> . flc is also conspicuously absent in the legumes  <cit> . consistent with this previous observation, we were unable to identify a flc homolog in the mads-domain tf family represented in the cowpea gsrs .

genes controlling symbiosis and biotic stress responses
legumes form mutually beneficial symbiotic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal  fungi and bacteria collectively known as rhizobia that are of tremendous agricultural importance  <cit> . establishing a fully functional symbiosis requires the successful completion of numerous steps, beginning with the recognition of chemical signals exchanged between the plant and bacterial/fungal symbiont and culminating in the differentiation of functional symbiotic cells/tissues. the process is the result of tightly regulated biochemical and molecular interactions between the legume host and its symbiont  <cit> . while the processes of nodulation and am invasion have been extensively examined in other legume species, little experimental work has been done in cowpea. we searched the gsrs for homologs of genes known to be involved in nodulation and am-legume symbiosis and identified the following: nfr1/nfr <dig>  receptor kinases that perceive the bacterial derived signal in nodulation; symrk, receptor-like kinases that integrate perception of the signal and initiate symbiosis; nin <dig> and members of the nin-like family of tfs; gras-domain family proteins, such as nsp <dig> and nsp2; dmi <dig> and dmi3; putative plastidic ion channel protein components castor and pollux; nucleoporin nup <dig>  required for the induction of ca2+ spiking in nodule development; nodulin -genes and genes encoding various nodule-specific proteins.

a large number of genes are involved in plant responses to biotic stresses   <cit> . both resistance  genes and genes encoding components of the signaling pathways activated by the r genes in the defense response have been extensively studied  <cit> . the largest class of r genes encodes intracellular proteins containing a nucleotide binding-site  and c-terminal leucine-rich repeats . the nbs family can be divided into multiple subfamilies based upon the presence or absence of other domains, such as a toll/interleukin receptor domain  region, a coiled-coil  domain, and a bed finger and/or duf  <dig> domain  <cit> . comparison of legume and non-legume resistance gene homologs indicates that legume genes possess a unique evolutionary history, with many clades either unique to legumes or expanded within legumes  <cit> . preliminary homology-based analysis of the cowpea gsrs dataset using previously identified conserved nbs domains from cowpea r genes  <cit> , and nbs and llr domains from r genes of other legume and non-legume species, identified >  <dig> r genes and r gene candidates. a fuller analysis of the diversity and phylogenetic relationships of these r genes is now underway.

in addition to the r genes, many of the conserved signaling components of the disease resistance response pathways are present in the cowpea gsrs, including ndr <dig>  rpm <dig>  coi <dig>  eds <dig>  eds <dig>  pr <dig>  sgt <dig>  rps <dig>  and rin <dig>  consistent with previous reports in other plant species, expression of these genes in cowpea has been shown to be activated by treatment with salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, or ethylene, and by wounding or by attack by the parasitic angiosperm striga gesnerioides  <cit> .

categories and distribution of simple sequence repeats 
simple sequence repeats  provide the basis of the most flexible and most widely exploited molecular marker systems for marker assisted selection and genetic analysis in crops  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  gsrs  contain at least one ssr. of these,  <dig>  have been allocated a putative function through a blast-homology based search. the ssrs vary in both repeat composition and repeat length, with di- and tri-nucleotide motifs being the most prevalent. at/ta repeats were the commonest dinucleotide motif. among the trinucleotide repeats, at-rich groups  predominated in the total gsr dataset, whereas ata and ttc were the most frequently occurring trinucleotide repeats among the annotated gsrs. the nature and size distributions of the cowpea ssrs  <dig> bp or greater is summarized in table  <dig> and additional information can be found at  <cit> .

a repeat motif by nucleotide unit length of more than  <dig> bp repeat length

CONCLUSIONS
among the legumes, comparative genetic mapping established early on that linkage relationships were well conserved between closely related genera  <cit> . as more sequence information has become available, the extent to which both macro- and microsynteny relationships exist has emerged. despite significant differences in genome size, a high level of macrosynteny exists between medicago and the galegoids , whereas less macrosynteny is observed between medicago and the phaseolids   <cit> . the present work provides a firm foundation for detailed comparative studies of cowpea with other warm season legumes, which apart from soybean are as yet poorly represented. many of the cowpea coding regions were readily mapped to the m. truncatula pseudomolecules, allowing for future efforts aimed at the dissection and analysis of regions of macro- and microsynteny. such information, in combination with improvements of the current cowpea genetic map  <cit>  will facilitate positional cloning of key genes of agronomic interest.

the development of genomic scale information and its use to conduct global transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses is a major goal of the legume research community  <cit> . such analyses are already well advanced in the model legumes  <cit> . the provision of extensive genomic data for cowpea, a non-model legume with significant importance in the developing world, represents a significant step forward in legume research. not only does the gene space sequence provided here enable the detailed analysis of gene structure, gene family organization and phylogenetic relationships within cowpea, but it also facilitates the further characterization of syntenic relationships among cultivated and model legumes. ultimately these types of studies will contribute to determining patterns of chromosomal evolution in the leguminosae. the determination of micro- and macrosyntenic relationships between cowpea and other cultivated and model legumes should assist in the identification of informative markers for use in marker-assisted trait selection and map-based gene isolation. the gsrs sequences we have generated also provide a resource for future studies of gene expression within cowpea. the development of oligonucleotide-based microarrays for functional genomics analysis is currently underway in our laboratory and this resource should soon be available for the legume community. we hope that the information and materials provided here will stimulate the broader goal of the genetic improvement of cowpea, which is a priority for the alleviation of the burden of biotic and abiotic stresses on subsistence farmers in developing parts of the world.
