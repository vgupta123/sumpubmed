BACKGROUND
oxygenic photosynthesis leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species , such as singlet oxygen  and superoxide anions   <cit> . the latter are rapidly converted to hydrogen peroxide   <cit> . h2o <dig> is scavenged by low molecular weight antioxidants, such as ascorbate and glutathione  <cit> . more efficiently, it is enzymatically inactivated by peroxidases  <cit> . inside chloroplasts, the main peroxidases are ascorbate peroxidases , peroxiredoxins  and glutathione peroxidases   <cit> .

cyanobacteria are the closest relatives of the prokaryotic evolutionary ancestors of plastids. like chloroplasts, they already protected themselves against the photooxygenic pressure of photosynthesis by the activity of apx, prx and gpx  <cit> . in addition, many cyanobacteria encode a bifunctional ascorbate peroxidase-catalase , which was not maintained in plants.

in seed plants, apx, gpx and prx are the major plastid h2o <dig> scavenging enzymes  <cit> : apx reduce h2o <dig> at the thylakoid membrane and in the chloroplast stroma on the expense of ascorbate  <cit> . in parallel, gpx  <cit>  and three types of peroxiredoxins, namely 2-cys peroxiredoxins , peroxiredoxins q  and type-ii peroxiredoxins   <cit> , protect chloroplasts against h2o <dig> and alkyl hydroperoxides via thiol-mediated reaction mechanisms  <cit> : 2cp, prxii and gpx are stromal proteins  <cit> , while prxq are targeted to the thylakoid lumen  <cit> .

during plant evolution, the photosynthetic endosymbiont lost all its genes for antioxidant enzymes from its genome. prior and during this process, the antioxidant enzymes were replaced by nuclear encoded homologs. the gene products are post-translationally targeted to chloroplasts  <cit> . the targeting signal is encoded in a n-terminal transit peptide  <cit> . the chloroplast isoforms of apx, gpx and prxii have cytosolic counterparts  <cit> , while in higher plants 2cp and prxq are exclusively found in chloroplasts  <cit> . plant gpx show a high sequence similarity to animal gpx <dig>  suggesting an eukaryotic origin  <cit> . for gpx of arabidopsis, rice and barley, margis et al.  <cit>  postulated common origin of the genes encoding plastid and extra-plastidic isoforms. paralogs evolved by gene duplication and subsequent gene-specific mutations. according to margis et al.  <cit> , the initial duplication took place at least before the emergence of gymnosperms.

in contrast, 2cp have been postulated to be of endosymbiotic origin  <cit> . in general, it is very likely that the chloroplast antioxidant protection system was arranged by combination of genes inherited by the heterotrophic eukaryotic ancestor cell of plants and of organellar origin. during more than one billion years of evolution, plants have faced strong environmental changes, such as long- and short-term temperature and light changes and variation of water, co <dig> and o <dig> availability. the variable environment has challenged and shaped the antioxidant defense systems via influencing photosynthesis and photooxidative ros formation.

here, the chloroplast peroxidase system was compared in four model organisms, for which  full genome information is available. the selected species represent different steps in chlorobiont evolution. we screened est and genomic databases of the unicellular green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii , the moss physcomitrella patens  and the spike moss selaginella moellendorffii  for open reading frames  encoding chloroplast targeted apx, gpx and prx.

chlamydomonas belongs to the group of chlorophyceae within the chlorophyte branch of chlorobionta. the unicellular alga with one large chloroplast per cell, still forms phycoplasts instead of phragmoplasts upon cell division  <cit> . in the streptophyte branch, mosses, such as the ancestors of physcomitrella, evolved approximately  <dig> million years ago and separated from cormophytes  <cit> . within the cormophytes, the spike mosses diverted from the lineage of seed plant precursors approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> .

based on genome comparisons it will be shown that there has been a permanent selective pressure on the maintenance of apx, gpx and prx activity in chloroplasts despite changes in the suborganellar distribution and in the gene copy number. comparison of gene structures will indicate common or independent origins.

RESULTS
genome resources at jgi http://www.jgi.doe.gov, tair http://www.arabidopsis.org, cosmoss http://www.cosmoss.org and chlamydb http://www.chlamy.org provide automatically generated and annotated gene models for chlamydomonas reinhardtii, physcomitrella patens, selaginella moellendorffii and arabidopsis thaliana based on bioinformatic gene-predictions and improvement by blast-comparison of genomic dna with est data resources  <cit> . the automated approaches have two disadvantages: firstly, if the sequence similarity of genes is high, the same ests can align to all genes and pretend expressional activity of various similar genes, even if only one gene is active. secondly, due to the low sequence similarity of transit peptides even between related organisms, organelle targeting signals and terminal membrane anchors are often not recognized  <cit> . sequence analysis then easily results in wrong predictions for protein localization.

in this study we aimed at the genome-wide identification and annotation of genes encoding chloroplast peroxidases, namely apx, gpx and prx, in distantly related model organisms. the chlorobionts chlamydomonas reinhardtii, physcomitrella patens and selaginella moellendorffii were compared to the reference seed plant arabidopsis thaliana and the sequences were evaluated with respect to function and localization. the analysis follows up with previous comparison of gene families  <cit> , focusing on the composition of the chloroplast antioxidant system.

primary data mining for chloroplast apx, prx and gpx
to minimize the difficulties of sequence homology-based genome annotation, data mining was started with screening selaginella moellendorffii, physcomitrella patens and chlamydomonas reinhardtii est databases for sequences with similarity to cdnas encoding arabidopsis thaliana apx, gpx and prx using blastn and tblastx  <cit> . in this step all information was collected irrespective of the localization of the encoded proteins. subsequently, the collected ests were clustered by clustalw <dig>  based on nucleotide sequence similarity.

these first clusters indicated  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> apx for chlamydomonas, physcomitrella and selaginella, respectively, and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 2cp,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> prxq and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> prxii and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> gpx . to analyze the primary datasets for gene duplication and alternative splicing all non-perfectly matching est sequences were removed from the est assembly. the excluded ests were subsequently re-tested for their similarity to other or additional est clusters.

from each refined cluster, the consensus sequence was predicted from the sequence alignment and was used as a working model for a gene-specific class of transcripts. to test whether the particular consensus encodes a peroxidase, the amino acid sequences were compared with the amino acid sequences of characterized arabidopsis proteins  <cit> .

finally, the genomes of chlamydomonas, physcomitrella and selaginella were screened by sequence similarity based on tblastx analysis for so far not identified paralogs and pseudogenes. this analysis resulted in  <dig> additional putative peroxidase sequences . the collected set of sequence data was subsequently evaluated with respect of chloroplast targeting.

n- and c-terminus prediction
our study specifically focused on identification of genes encoding chloroplast apx, gpx and prx. est-assembly and est-alignment-based sequence retrieval and prediction resulted in various sequences with atypical start or stop codons indicating that the sequences lack information on the protein c- and n-termini, such as n-terminal organellar targeting signals and c-terminal membrane anchors, or that the ests reflect incomplete or wrong splicing or genomic contaminations of the est libraries.

the nucleotide and amino acid sequence conservation of n-terminal targeting signals and cterminal membrane anchors are often low between species, because the encoded protein domains are mainly structurally conserved  <cit> . to overcome this detriment, blastn searches in est databases were performed with the 5'- and 3'- ends of the previously retrieved cluster consensus sequences in the third round of data mining. all newly collected ests were tested for their cluster compatibility by blastn sequence comparison. from the refined est-clusters, the hypothetical cluster consensus cdna was calculated using the clustalw <dig>  multiple sequence alignment tool  <cit> .

for all remaining est clusters without n-terminal transit peptides, the genomic dna was screened  <dig> bp upstream of the est covered regions for transcriptional start sites and/or additional exons by dbtss  <cit>  and fex  <cit>  . in parallel, since identification of n-terminal targeting signals turned out to be the most difficult step, the three reading frames of the  <dig> bp upstream genomic sequences were translated into amino acid sequences and screened for sequence criteria indicating organellar targeting sequences  <cit> . special attention was given to the ratio of hydroxylated and positively charged amino acid residues.

similarly,  <dig> bp downstream of all predicted apx sequences, the respective genomic dna was screened for transmembrane helices by predictprotein  <cit>  and retested by tmhmm  <cit> , tmpro  <cit>  and wheel http://cti.itc.virginia.edu/~cmg/demo/wheel/wheel_instructions.html following three frame translation. for any sequence indicating a putative n-terminal or c-terminal extension the est databases were screened by blastn for so far not identified ests.

finally, any predicted chloroplast peroxidase was scanned for its chloroplast targeting probability using targetp and atp. these prediction algorithms base on sequence patterns of chloroplast proteins from higher plants  and physcomitrella . in chlamydomonas reinhardtii a single large chloroplast almost completely surrounds the nucleus. as shown e.g. for lhcii and rbcs, which are post-translationally targeted to chloroplasts by strong n-terminal targeting signals in higher plants  <cit> , protein targeting frequently takes place by localized cytoplasmic mrna translation and demands for less strong chloroplast targeting signals  <cit> . consequently, the cut-off values were evaluated for chlamydomonas based on sequence characteristics . finally, the deduced and validated sequences tags were aligned with the clustered ests to predict the full length cdnas, which were translated into amino acid sequences and compared with genomic dna. for the four species, sequence analysis resulted in prediction of  <dig> orfs encoding chloroplast prx, gpx or apx. for  <dig> orfs gene-specific ests were observed. the  <dig> remaining orfs may be silent pseudogenes, only weakly expressed or expressed only at certain times or in response to specific stimuli.

comparison of predicted sequences with data resources of peroxibase
finally the predicted sequences were compared with peroxibase  <cit> , which is a novel database summarizing est-assembly based predictions for plant peroxidases of various cellular compartments. for  <dig> of the here described  <dig> orfs , entries are listed in peroxibase .

while the coverage of arabidopsis, physcomitrella and chlamydomonas chloroplast peroxidases was good in peroxibase, all except two of the chloroplast peroxidases of selaginella moellendorffii were newly predicted in our study . in addition, one notlisted  chlamydomonas orf was described and two physcomitrella prxii were newly predicted . based on our est-assembly analysis the n-termini of one physcomitrella chloroplast apx  and of one selaginella 2cp  were corrected . furthermore, for a physcomitrella 2cp , which is encoded by an incompletely assembled genome domain in cosmoss, the c-terminus was extended by combination of sequence information split on two sequencing units. additionally, so far not covered short sequence traces were inserted in the ppprxqc  and crsapxb  sequences and the sequence translation was corrected for the chlamydomonas gpxa orf by addition of missing g <dig> .

from this study,  <dig> orfs for chloroplast peroxidases were predicted for the each of the two sequenced haplotypes of selaginella moellendorffii,  <dig> chloroplast peroxidase orfs for physcomitrella patens and  <dig> for chlamydomonas reinhardtii . they were compared to six well described arabidopsis chloroplast peroxidases  <cit> . specific characteristics of the here predicted chloroplast peroxidases are:

ascorbate peroxidases
gene copy number and predicted protein localization
many higher plants encode two types of chloroplast ascorbate peroxidases: one is localized in the stroma  and one anchored in the thylakoid membrane by a c-terminal transmembrane helix   <cit> . in our study, the predicted chloroplast apx sequences were sub-classified into membrane anchored and soluble isoforms based on tmhmm  <cit>  and tmpro analysis for transmembrane helices  <cit> . the lipophilicity of the outer helix surface was tested by wheel-analysis.

in arabidopsis thaliana stromal and thylakoid ascorbate peroxidases are encoded by two distinct genes, at4g <dig>  and at1g <dig>   <cit> . in contrast, e.g. in tobacco, spinach and pumpkin stromal and thylakoid ascorbate peroxidases result from alternative splicing of the same gene  <cit> . in rice, the sapx gene triplicated , while there is only one gene encoding a tapx . the comparison demonstrates dynamics in the gene copy number over time.

after removal of the extraplastidic isoforms, est analysis of two haplotypes of selaginella moellendorffii resulted in four clusters encoding chloroplast apx. two clusters encode sapx and two tapx with c-terminal transmembrane helices. the sequences within each pair differ only in  <dig> -  <dig> bp. comparison of the gene environment revealed that the predicted sequences are surrounded by the same genes. thus, the predicted similar consensus cdnas represent homologous genes from the two haplotypes, of which genomic dna was extracted for sequencing  <cit> . it is concluded that each haplotype encodes one stromal  and one thylakoid apx  .

in contrast to the phanerophytes arabidopsis and selaginella, the bryophyte physcomitrella patens encodes only one apx . the amino acid composition of the c-terminal extension gives strong indications for a  <dig> amino acid long transmembrane helix , demonstrating that the only ascorbate peroxidase is a tapx. in the ncbi database the sequence tag is annotated as sapx  because the automated prediction lacks the sequence information on the transmembrane anchor. alignment of ests gave no indication for alternative splicing , demonstrating that in physcomitrella all chloroplast apx activity is thylakoid-bound and that the moss does not encode a sapx.

on the contrary, chlamydomonas reinhardtii expresses only a sapx . tmhmm-  <cit>  and amphipaseek-screens  <cit>  for transmembrane helices were negative . in the chlamydomonas genome, a second orf for a putative soluble apx  was observed. however, crsapxb is not covered by ests.

comparison of the stromal domain of the mature proteins  separates the two chlamydomonas apx sequences in a species-specific manner . crsapxa clusters with chloroplast apx. in contrast, for crsapxb only homologues from fungi and non-green algae  were reported in peroxibase. according to sequence homology, crsapxb is classified as a hybrid ascorbatecytochrome c peroxidase .

in addition to the two chlamydomonas apx reported here, peroxibase lists a third apx with similarities to putative chloroplast apx for chlamydomonas . we excluded the gene in our est-assembly analysis, because parts of the catalytic site, e.g. aa <dig> - aa <dig>  are strongly modified in the algal protein indicating that the enzyme has no ascorbate peroxidase function.

exon-intron structure
evolution primarily selects for the functionality of proteins. most non-sense mutations get discarded. intron insertions, deletions and splice site shifts can be tolerated more easily. consequently, analysis of gene structures can reveal additional information on the phylogenetic relationship between genes of different organisms  <cit> .

in arabidopsis thaliana, the coding sequence of sapx is split into  <dig> exons and the tapx is encoded by  <dig> exons . this exon encodes the  <dig> amino acids long c-terminal transmembrane helix. in attapx an additional intron is inserted in the 0-position of the codon for aa <dig> . this intron is missing in atsapx .

the exon-intron-structure of selaginella tapx resembles that of arabidopsis tapx in both haplotypes. the splice sites are widely conserved to arabidopsis tapx from the second site onwards . like in attapx, the sequence encoding aa <dig> - aa <dig>  is split into two exons . the similar gene structure indicates that smtapx, smsapx and attapx evolved very likely from a common ancestor gene. as species-specific variation, the introns are all shorter in selaginella than in arabidopsis.

compared to atsapx, smsapx has an extended acidic and hydroxylated c-terminus . its sequence shows no homology to the c-terminus of any tapx or sapx listed in peroxibase  or in enzymes identified in our analysis  and, consequently, is a specific extension of smsapx.

in the green alga chlamydomonas the two sapx genes have  <dig> exons each . the introns were much longer than in atsapx. in total, the difference in intron length increases the size of the genes by a factor of  <dig>  -  <dig>  in crsapxa, from the third exon downstream, four splice sites are conserved with arabidopsis thaliana apx and two differ only in one codon length . for crsapxb, the gene structure analysis revealed only one conserved splice site   confirming the less related nature of the gene.

pptapx, which is the only chloroplast apx of physcomitrella patens, has the most atypical gene structure within the group of analyzed genes. the pptapx hnrna has only one splice site. it is located approximately in the mid of the transcript at the non-conserved position 273- <dig>  . the gc-content of the pptapx transcript is with  <dig> % increased if compared to attapx transcript  and to the average gc-content of physcomitrella genes . the pptapx gene is flanked by large footprints of angela ltr retrotransposons http://www.cosmoss.org, indicating that the only apx gene of physcomitrella encoding a plastid isoform is of retrotransposonal origin and not directly related to the described apx genes from the other analyzed species.

expression analysis
to test the predicted apx genes for expression and the predicted transcript length, rna was isolated from chlamydomonas reinhardtii, selaginella moellendorffii and physcomitrella patens and transcribed into cdna. subsequently, the cdnas were tested for sapx or tapx expression by saturating pcr  with primers binding to the gene specific sequences encoding the n-terminus and the c-terminus of the mature protein. with all samples single products with predicted lengths of  <dig> bp for crsapxa,  <dig> bp for crsapxb,  <dig> bp for pptapx,  <dig> bp for smsapx and  <dig> bp for smtapx were amplified , confirming the gene predictions  and demonstrating expression of all predicted genes. since rna isolation is different for the various species and results in different yields, quantitative comparison of transcript abundances was omitted.

characteristics of the predicted proteins
among the identified chloroplast apx, the amino acid residues forming the catalysis triad  are conserved in all identified proteins . all proteins have also r <dig>  w <dig> and h <dig> in common , which coordinate the h2o <dig> molecule in the active site  <cit> . in response to excess h2o <dig>  w <dig> can crosslink with the heme, which irreversibly inhibits the enzyme  <cit> . regarding the heme binding site, in physcomitrella tapx and chamydomonas sapx position r <dig> is replaced by a h, like it is in many cytosolic apx  <cit> . all other amino acids important for heme binding   <cit>   are conserved within the examined species.

the amino acids involved in ascorbate binding    <cit>  are widely conserved like several unspecified residues . in total  <dig> - 79% amino acid identity for sapx and  <dig> - 79% identity for tapx reflect a high overall similarity between arabidopsis, selaginella and physcomitrella chloroplast apx. many amino acid substitutions conserve the chemical properties of the protein , for example e <dig> is replaced by the also acidic amino acid d in both smsapx and attapx and s <dig> is substituted by t and l <dig> by v in pptapx. the most prominent amino acid exchange is the replacement of w <dig> by f in crsapxa, crsapxb und pptapx since the f288w substitution has been proposed to provide higher ascorbate specificity to chloroplast apx compared to cytosolic apx  <cit> .

ascorbate peroxidases bind one or two cations on the protein surface, which are involved in heme coordination  <cit> . the distal cation binding site   is conserved in all apx encoded by expressed genes. in the proximal cation binding pocket  , k <dig> is exchanged by e in crsapxa. the higher number of negative charges provides a stronger ionic interface for the potassium ion. superimposition of the modeled structure of crsapxa with atsapx  shows that two short insertions  form loops, designated "evolutionary variable loops i and ii" , on the protein surface .

2-cys peroxiredoxins
gene copy number
like arabidopsis thaliana , physcomitrella patens encodes two 2cp  . n-terminal targeting signals indicate that both are chloroplast-targeted isoforms. due to a gap between the genome scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig> http://www.cosmoss.org, no gene model was predictable for pp2cpb.

the two haplotypes of selaginella encode two pairs of almost identical 2cp, designated sm2cpa.1/ <dig> and sm2cpb.1/ <dig>  for the sm2cpb genes no ests were observed , indicating that they are putatively not, only weakly or only under defined circumstances expressed. according to gene models presently provided by the selaginella databases, the sm2cpb start-codons were predicted corresponding to position  <dig> or  <dig>  and lacking the n-terminal extension with chloroplast targeting propensity. a homologous, but incomplete putative n-terminal extension was observed for sm2cpb. <dig> .

in the genome of chlamydomonas reinhardtii three open reading frames for 2cp were identified . cr2cpa is identical to prx <dig> and cr2cpb to prx <dig>  which were previously described by dayer et al.  <cit> . for the cr2cpa gene  <dig> ests were observed in the jgi database and  <dig> in chlamydb, indicating that the gene is strongly expressed relative to other peroxidases in chlamydomonas. the deduced protein sequence shows a typical n-terminal chloroplast targeting signal. for cr2cpb, which was previously predicted to be cytosolic   <cit> , only  <dig> ests were observed in the jgi database and  <dig> in chlamydb , suggesting that the gene is less expressed. the n-terminus of the protein is exceptionally short if compared to 2cp from other plants . chlamydomonas genes often have longer introns than those of arabidopsis and selaginella . thus, for the cr2cpb gene  <dig> bp upstream sequence were screened for a putative additional exon, but no indications were found for a putative targeting signal with targetp-values higher than  <dig>  . it indicates that the cr2cpb gene, although only weakly expressed, may encode the first identified plant non-chloroplast 2cp consistent with the protein localization suggested by dayer et al.  <cit> . however, as shown for rbcs and lhcii, protein import into chloroplasts is strongly regulated by localized translation in chlamydomonas  <cit> , which does not necessarily need strong chloroplast import signals.

furthermore, our study identified a third putative, but not-est-covered 2cp gene, cr2cpc, on scaffold  <dig> , which shares higher similarity with cr2cpb than with cr2cpa . according to the neighborhood joining  and minimal evolution algorithms , cr2cpa clusters into the same branch as cyanobacterial 2cp, while cr2cpb and cr2cpc form an independent outgroup. only the maximum parsimony algorithm , which accounts for the most parsimonious explanation based on weighting each amino acid position discretely  <cit> , clusters the three chlamydomonas reinhardtii 2cp with a 2cp known from chlamydomonas incerta in a group which is closely related to cyanobacterial 2cp.

exon-intron structure
like for apx, the gene structures of the 2cp were analyzed by comparison of cdna sequences with genomic dna . the two a. thaliana 2cp have very similar structures with conserved exon-intron borders . the first exon of at2cpb, which encodes the less conserved chloroplast targeting signal, is eight amino acids longer than in at2cpa. the main difference between the two genes is the length of the introns, which are slightly longer in at2cpb.

a very similar gene structure with seven exons was observed for sm2cpa  demonstrating gene conservation between the lycophyte and the seed plant. the introns are all shorter in sm2cpa than in arabidopsis 2cp genes, which decreases the total length of the gene by 33%. the splice sites are conserved with those in a. thaliana 2cp . the not-est-covered selaginella 2cpb gene has eight instead of seven exons due to an additional intron in the corresponding first exon of sm2cpa . the splice site between exon <dig> and exon <dig> is gene-specific and elongates exon <dig> by  <dig> nucleotides. in general, the introns of sm2cpb are longer and their length is more variable than in sm2cpa .

in physcomitrella patens pp2cpa has seven exons, which are separated by comparably long introns . from the second splice site  onwards, the exon-intron borders are conserved with the two arabidopsis 2cp. the first border  differs by only one amino acid from the border found in the arabidopsis 2cp .

for chlamydomonas reinhardtii, three 2cp genes were detected in the genome. their gene structure is non-conserved and atypical if compared to physcomitrella, selaginella and arabidopsis 2cp . cr2cpa has only three exons while the weakly or not expressed cr2cpb and cr2cpc genes have seven and eight exons, respectively, with non-conserved splice sites.

characteristics of the predicted proteins
despite the variability in gene structures , the amino acid sequences of the mature 2cp share many conserved positions . the catalytic sites around the peroxidatic c <dig> , around the resolving cysteine residue c <dig>   and the active pocket    <cit>  are identical in all 2cp for which est data were observed. furthermore, the gglg-motif  is conserved in all species. according to jönsson et al.  <cit> , the motif is specific for eukaryotic 2cp and stabilizes the folded structure together with the yf-motif , decelerates disulfide formation and increases the sensitivity to h2o <dig> 

strongest differences were observed for cr2cpb, cr2cpc and sm2cpb. for example, in the hydrophobic pocket around the resolving c <dig>  g <dig> and k <dig> are replaced by n and w <dig> is exchanged by a less bulky f-residue in cr2cpb. in brassica 2cp w <dig> is replaced by g  <cit>  indicating that this position is less important for 2cp function than other amino acids. the dimer interface described by schroder et al.  <cit>   is replaced by a q-ha/s-t-i/v-n-n consensus in most plant 2cp   <cit> , including all estconfirmed 2cp identified in this study .

the interface   involved in decamer formation  <cit>  is conserved . however, there are a few protein modifications in the dimer and decamer interfaces between the identified proteins: as mentioned before, w <dig>  which is also part of the active site, is replaced by f in cr2cpb. sm2cpa and pp2cpa show g251n and an i281v substitutions and sm2cpb, which is encoded by a presumably nonexpressed or only weakly expressed gene, has a g251r substitution. these two positions are known to be involved in dimer stability  <cit> . in sm2cpb also the yf-motif , which is involved in stabilization of the peroxidatic c  <cit> , is replaced by hf and aa328-aa <dig> are missing, suggesting that the putatively less expressed gene does not encode a  functional protein. sm2cpa and pp2cpa show charge conservative amino acid substitutions with weak sterical effects  in the decamer contact phase. at aa <dig> in the 2cp alignment only arabidopsis shows a s while sm2cpa, sm2cpb, the physcomitrella 2cp, and cr2cpa reveal an a residue and cr2cpb and cr2cpc an i and v, respectively.

cr2cpb shows a specific three amino acid long insertion at positions aa <dig> - aa <dig> , which extends a β-sheet on the protein surface . in this protein, like in cr2cpc and partially also in cr2cpa, charged amino acids are atypically substituted: negatively charged d <dig>  e <dig> and q <dig> are substituted by positively and uncharged residues and e <dig> by r, k or a. uncharged s <dig> and l <dig> are substituted by k, e, r and g, and k <dig> , k <dig> , k <dig> , k <dig> , k <dig> , k <dig>  and k <dig> , which are otherwise widely conserved throughout the 2cp family  <cit> , and k <dig> is deleted .

the c-terminus, which is involved in the attachment of 2cp to membranes  <cit> , is more hydroxylated in cr2cpb due to s/t-substitutions at position  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . in cr2cpc, which is not covered by ests, the c-terminus is extended by a g- and p-rich  <dig> amino acid long peptide. secondary structure analysis gave no indications for strong structural features, such as α-helices or β-sheets  indicating a long unstructured c-terminal tail, such as in animal and yeast 2cp  <cit> .

consistent with the degree of primary structure conservation, modeling of the 3d-structures indicate strong differences between cr2cpb and at2cpa , while the structure of the other est-covered 2cp is conserved : in cr2cpb  a three amino acid insertion  extends and slightly tilts the β-sheet which is involved in formation of the active site . other sequence variations impact on the dynamic loops, designated "evolutionary variable loop" ii and iii. evalo ii is located on the outer surface of the 2cp toroid-decamer structure  <cit> . in contrast, evalo iii shapes the inner surface of the 2cp-toroid. these predicted modifications indicate a specific surface of cr2cpb oligomers .

the atypical 2-cys peroxiredoxins prxq and prxii
gene copy number
the atypical 2cp family is comprised of two enzyme groups: prxq and prxii. in arabidopsis thaliana, one out of six prxii, prxiie , is targeted to the chloroplast stroma  <cit> . the only prxq is post-translationally targeted to the thylakoid lumen  <cit> . according to neighborhood joining , minimum evolution and maximum parsimony trees  all identified streptophyte prxii and prxq cluster with chloroplast homologs from other plants.

like arabidopsis thaliana, selaginella moellendorffii encodes two prxii proteins with nterminal targeting signals per haploid genome. one is homologous to chloroplast atprxiie, the other to mitochondrial atprxiif . the chloroplast smprxii is most similar to the pinus prxiie .

in contrast, two orfs encoding prxq were identified  in the genome of selaginella indicating a gene duplication. for smprxqa  <dig> ests were counted indicating that the gene is functionally active. no est was observed for smprxqb, which is less similar to higher plant prxq than smprxqa .

the bryophyte physcomitrella expresses three chloroplast prxq and two prxii. the gene number demonstrates an amplification of genes encoding atypical prx if compared to chlamydomonas, selaginella and arabidopsis . according to the calculated phylogenetic trees  and in contrast to other prx genes the three prxq proteins, especially ppprxqa, show species-specific sequence characteristics .

consistent with dayer et al.  <cit> , one chloroplast prxii and one chloroplast prxq were observed  in chlamydomonas reinhardtii . however, unlike dayer et al.  <cit> , no est was detected for prxq by using the jgi and chlamydb data resources.

exon-intron structure of prxq
in arabidopsis, selaginella and physcomitrella two splice sites are conserved within the prxq genes  . ppprxqa, the selaginella and arabidopsis homologs share an additional splice site at amino acid position 126- <dig> . crprxq shows a distinct splice pattern. only one splice site  is conserved with ppprxqa, the selaginella and arabidopsis homologs and no splice site is conserved with ppprxqb and ppprxqc .

if compared to c. reinhardtii, the gene structure of ppprxqa was more similar to atprxq and smprxq . it has four exons. the first and the fourth exon have approximately the same length as in the selaginella homolog. the exons are separated by three introns which are longer than in atprxq, smprxqa and smprxqb and elongate the entire gene. ppprxqb and ppprxqc both have only three exons. their second exon combines exon <dig> and exon <dig> of atprxq, smprxq, and ppprxqa. in smprxqb there is an additional splice site in the last exon .

exon-intron structure of prxii
the prxii proteins of a. thaliana, s. moellendorffii and p. patens are encoded within a single exon . in contrast, the c. reinhardtii prxii gene has five exons separated by four introns of different sizes.

characteristics of the predicted prxq and prxii proteins
to compare prxq and prxii from arabidopsis, selaginella, physcomitrella and chlamydomonas, the cdna sequences were translated. the derived amino acid sequences were aligned by clustalw <dig>  . atypical plant prx have so far not been investigated to such detail as apx or typical 2cp. only few amino acids have been reported to be essential for their activity: the peroxidatic and resolving c residues are characteristic for most prx. in prxq, the conserved c residues are located at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  and in prxii at  <dig> and  <dig> . additional specific criteria are:

prxq
compared to non-plant prxq  <cit> , the amino acid sequences are more similar between plant species. in ppprxq, smprxq and atprxq many positively charged amino acid residues are conserved . k, r, q and n are protonated under acidic conditions, such as there are in the thylakoid lumen during light periods, where prxq is post-translationally targeted to  <cit> . crprxq lacks negative charges at position  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and positive charges at position  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in phylograms, the algal protein is not grouped with prxq from higher plants , but defines a distinct group, demonstrating that chlamydomonas reinhardtii expresses a specific type of prxq.

in the analyzed plant prxq, among the amino acids located close to the active site, aa <dig>  aa <dig> and aa <dig> are not conserved . atprxq, ppprxqa, ppprxqb, smprxqb and crprxq show a t residue at position  <dig> while it is replaced by the also hydroxylated amino acid s in smprxqa and ppprxqc. more important in respect of enzyme activity might be the exchange of the positively charged q <dig> to a negatively charged e in smprxq and crprxq and the g122t exchange in ppprxqb, since they affect the charge distribution close to the active site  .

besides the variation of a hydroxylated amino acid residue in the - <dig> position  and p residues in the - <dig> and - <dig> position relative to the peroxidatic cysteine residue  and r <dig>  which has been proposed to be important for dimer stabilization in peroxiredoxins  <cit> , there is too little information on functionally important motifs and amino acids to draw conclusions on enzyme conservation.

the peroxiredoxin fold was investigated by predicting the 3d-structure with swiss-model . the parallel β-sheet core and the conserved α-helices give the streptophyte prxq proteins a rigid common structure. on the protein surface there are three flexible loops in streptophyte prxq  and five loops in the chlamydomonas prxq. the k, r, q, and n residues, which may be important for the ph-sensitivity of the enzyme, are evenly distributed on the protein surface .

prxii
recent crystal structure analysis of poplar prxii demonstrated that f <dig>  t <dig>  p <dig>  f <dig>  v <dig>  a <dig>  l <dig> and r <dig> form the active site and the interface in prxii dimers  <cit> . apart from position  <dig>  which is replaced by s in smprxii of both haplotypes, all positions are conserved in the analyzed species .

prxii interact electrostatically with their electron donors, such as glutaredoxins  <cit> . from the negative charges suggested to define the electrostatic surface of poplar prxii  <cit> , the positions  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  are conserved. in addition f <dig>  which is part of the hydrophobic surface domain, can be found in prxii of all analyzed species. in contrast, the poplar-specific e <dig> is replaced by d, s and a. e <dig> is substituted by small uncharged amino acids v, i and a and l <dig> partially by s and q in the here analyzed species .  <dig> d structural comparison showed various flexible loops on the protein surface , demonstrating that the structure of prxii proteins is less rigid than the one of the 2cp. chlamydomonas prxii showed the shortest n-terminal extension and a deletion of v <dig> and e <dig> 

the two physcomitrella prxii have atypical c-termini . the eight, instead of three, amino acid long c-terminus has two additional hydroxylated amino acids  and three , instead of one, positively charged residues . according to echalier et al.  <cit> , the c-terminus is exposed on the surface of prxii proteins. thus, the atypical tail of ppprxii may increase the hydrophilicity of the protein. superimposition of the  <dig> d structures demonstrates that in s. moellendorffii, p. patens and c. reinhardtii the position of the peroxidatic c  is slightly shifted if compared to atprxiie due to replacement of the positively charged q <dig> by s or l .

glutathione peroxidases
like peroxiredoxins, glutathione peroxidases are broad spectrum peroxidases, which detoxify h2o <dig> and a wide range of alkylhydroperoxides  <cit> . plant gpx cluster into the phylogentically ancient group of phospholipid hydroperoxides glutathione peroxidases   <cit> . based on sequence similarities and biochemical characterization they are alternatively designated as a subclass of peroxiredoxins  <cit> . all of the here described gpx have fully conserved fpcnqf  and wny/fxkfv/i  motifs , known for gpx from various plant kingdoms  <cit> .

arabidopsis chloroplast gpx
arabidopsis thaliana encodes seven gpx, of which three are organellar targeted by nterminal transit peptides  <cit> . gpx <dig>  is suggested to be alternatively targeted to mitochondria and the cytosol, while gpx <dig>  and gpx <dig>  are chloroplast-targeted and protect plants from photooxidative stress  <cit> . the conserved exonintron-structure strongly indicates a common origin of gpx <dig> and gpx <dig> , as well as of gpx <dig> . superimposure of atgpx <dig> and atgpx <dig> proteins modeled and presented by swiss-model and swiss-pdbviewer  <cit>  showed highly similar structures . in contrast, atgpx <dig> differs structurally by replacement of helix  <dig> by a not structured protein domain and a shorter helix  <dig> .

selaginella chloroplast gpx
in the genome of the two haplotypes of selaginella moellendorffii three different loci  were observed, which encode gpx similar to arabidopsis gpx <dig> and gpx <dig>  to date these six peroxidase sequences are not covered by peroxibase. smgpxa and smgpxb proteins show n-terminal extensions similar to organellar targeting signals. for smgpxa, both, the targetp- and atp-values were high  and indicate chloroplast targeting. for the two smgpxb isoforms the atp-values were high, but the targetp-values low . an  <dig> amino acids long n-terminal α-helix  with several hydroxylated amino acids and positive charges, however, points to organellar targeting and recognition by the protein import complex.

blastn-searches demonstrated strongly different expression intensities for the homologous gpx genes in the two selaginella haplotypes, for which similar expression intensities of apx and prx genes were shown . while  <dig> ests were observed for smgpxb. <dig>  none was found for smgpxb. <dig> 

an additional gene with putative gpx function, smgpxc, was detected in the genome of both analyzed haplotypes of selaginella . lack of an n-terminal chloroplast targeting signal  suggests extraplastidic localization.

comparison of the modeled protein structures revealed almost structural identity of smgpxa. <dig> and smgpxa. <dig> to atgpx <dig> and atgpx <dig>  the fold of smgpxb proteins differed. superimposure of smgpxb proteins and atgpx <dig> demonstrates a less structured organization of amino acid  <dig> to  <dig>  which form an α-helix in smgpxa and the arabidopsis chloroplast gpx protein . due to the unstructured domain, smgpxb shows higher similarity to mitochondrial atgpx <dig> . for both smgpxa and smgpxb haploforms cdna fragments of the predicted size  could be amplified by cdna-specific saturating rt-pcr  demonstrating expressional activity of all predicted selaginella genes encoding chloroplast gpx.

physcomitrella chloroplast gpx
in physcomitrella two gpx genes encoding putative organellar targeting signals with high atp- and targetp-scores  were identified. the exon-intron-structures of ppgpxa and ppgpxb are conserved with arabidopsis and selaginella homologs . similar to apx and prx genes, in physcomitrella the introns are longer than in arabidopsis and much longer than in selaginella.

for ppgpxa  <dig> ests were found additionally demonstrating expressional activity. one of the four ests covering the 3'-end of the orf indicates alternative splicing of the last intron. the last intron is maintained in this est, while it is spliced out in three other ests , like in all arabidopsis and selaginella ests. the single non-matching est shows that physcomitrella has a small propensity to encode c-terminal aberrant gpx  . for the second ppgpx locus, ppgpxb, no est was found in the data base .

to test for gene expression activity saturating rt-pcr was performed with rna isolated from sterile grown gametophytes. the reaction gave a strong signal of the expected size for ppgpxa. <dig> demonstrating presence of ppgpxa. <dig> mrna. for the splice variant ppgpxa. <dig> pcr with variant-specific primer combinations gave a weak band of  <dig> bp besides two larger, non-specific bands. in contrast, expressional activity of ppgpxb could not been shown by rt-pcr. under the applied temperature and mgcl2-conditions only dna fragments were amplified, which were too large to represent ppgpxb .

strong sequence modifications in the domains encoding the otherwise highly conserved fpcnqfxxqep environment  <cit>  of the catalytic site  in addition to several substitutions  and the untypical c-terminal extension  suggest that ppgpxb, if expressed, would have various structural modifications . therefore, it is very likely that this protein is not fully functional. superimposure of protein models demonstrated high structural similarity of ppgpxa. <dig> and ppgpxa. <dig> to atgpx <dig> and atgpx <dig>  indicating that ppgpxa is the physcomitrella homolog of arabidopsis gpx <dig> and gpx <dig> 

chlamydomonas chloroplast gpx
consistent with the previous analysis by dayer et al.  <cit> , three organellar gpx were detected in the genome of chlamydomonas reinhardtii . two of them crgpxa  and crgpxb  are selenoproteins  as gpx are in many animals and microbia  <cit> . on the contrary, crgpxc  is a nonselenocysteine gpx  like the gpx identified in the other plant analyzed species . our data are widely consistent with that of dayer et al.  <cit> , except for the primary sequence of crgpxa. for this protein the new translation demonstrated that in the previous description  <cit>  a g  was missing at the position following the selenocysteine.

the gene structures of crgpx genes are hardly conserved . except the splice site at the end of exon <dig> of crgpxc , chlamydomonas gpx transcripts and gpx hnrna from the other tested species have no splice site in common .

expressional activity of crgpxb and crgpxc was confirmed by saturating rt-pcr . under a wide range of conditions , no signals were observed which may indicate expression of crgpxa in our plant material. expression of crgpxa is either very low or restricted to very specific conditions.

the modeled two selenocysteine isoforms crgpxa and crgpxb show structural similarity to atgpx <dig> and atgpx <dig> . the predicted structure of the well expressed nonselenocysteine-type crgpxc shows several structural aberrations if compared to atgpx <dig> , indicating a distinct type of gpx. since even the position of the active site  is affected by aberrant twists in helix  <dig> and helix  <dig>  differences in the catalytic activity have to be assumed. despite the strong differences to atgpx <dig>  comparison to human gpx , showed stronger structural similarity of crgpxc to monomeric human gpx <dig> than to tetrameric gpx <dig> , demonstrating that the less conserved chlamydomonas isoforms also belongs to the monomeric gpx cluster.

phylogenetic tree analysis of plant gpx
according to margis et al.  <cit> , plant gpx evolved by four major gene duplication events from a single ancestral gene. the initial duplication has been supposed to have taken place prior to separation of monocots and dicots or even before separation of gymnosperms and angiosperms. phylogenetic analysis was performed with the protein sequences of the here investigated genes and sequences taken from peroxibase using neighborhood joining , maximum parsimony and minimum evolution algorithms . for arabidopsis thaliana all gpx were included in this analyses, irrespective of the subcellular localization of the enzymes. the distance of the chloroplast isoforms to the other arabidopsis gpx demonstrates that chloroplast atgpx <dig> and atgpx <dig> result from a late gene duplication which took place after separation of mitochondrial, cytoplasmic and chloroplast paralogs. for the chloroplast gpx genes from the other species a more ancient separation can be assumed from the distant positions in the calculated phylogenetic trees . the variability between the three different types of phylogenetic trees makes it impossible to definitely answer the question whether chloroplast targeting was established independently for different chloroplast paralogs or prior to the final gene duplication event. the phylogenetic trees, however, suggest early separation and independent evolution of gpx isoforms. therefore, compared to margis' et al.  <cit>  assumptions, our analysis shows that the gene duplication resulting in chloroplast paralogs occurred much earlier than the angiopserm - gymnosperm separation.

relative expression of peroxiredoxin, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione peroxidase genes
microarray-based data  show that sapx and tapx genes are weakly expressed in arabidopsis compared to 2cp . for the apx encoded by the two selaginella haplotypes,  <dig> and  <dig> sapx ests and  <dig> and  <dig> tapx ests  were identified in the est cluster analysis. in the same data set  <dig> and  <dig> ests for sm2cpa,  <dig> and  <dig> for smprxii and  <dig> and  <dig> for smprxq were counted. however, est numbers are not precise measures for gene expression activities, the relative numbers indicate a rather weak expression of apx if compared to prx. for p. patens, the relative est counts indicate stronger expression of pptapx. within the group of prx, the pp2cpa gene was slightly less covered by ests than the genes for ppprxiia and ppprxiib together, but more than the three prxq genes together. in c. reinhardtii, however, for crsapxa only  <dig> ests were counted in the jgi database, cr2cpa expression was represented by  <dig> ests. the other prx genes and the gpx genes were much less active, indicating that cr2cpa has the strongest impact on the chloroplast antioxidant system.

in general, est counts were lowest for gpx . in combination with functional restrictions indicated by superimposure of the predicted amino acid sequences  the analysis indicates a subordinary or very specific function of gpx in chloroplasts. in the comparison of species, selaginella moellendorffii may be excluded from this general conclusion. with  <dig> smgpxa ests for each haplotype  the est counts demonstrate similar or slightly stronger expression of gpx than apx genes.

discussion
in the antioxidant defense against photooxidative ros formation, apx and gpx as well as prx provide protection against peroxides and, therefore, have partially overlapping functions  <cit> . despite the long time of evolution following the separation of chlorophytes, mosses, ferns and higher plants, chlamydomonas reinhardtii, physcomitrella patens, selaginella moellendorffii and arabidopsis thaliana maintained parallel expression of chloroplast apx and gpx and all of them also target three types of prx to chloroplasts .

the est-assembly and sequence homology based genome wide search for orfs demonstrated that the gene copy number and the relative expression intensity changed during evolution: in selaginella moellendorffii and in physcomitrella patens the genes for chloroplast prxii and prxq were duplicated and triplicated, respectively. in selaginella, est counts showed a much stronger gpx expression relative to apx expression than in arabidopsis. together with amplification of prxii and prxq gene copy numbers , this data indicate a stronger preference for the non-ascorbate-linked antioxidant system in the spikemoss. in physcomitrella patens, the chloroplast antioxidant system lacks stromal apx activity. chlamydomonas reinhardtii does not have thylakoid-bound apx, but encodes three chloroplast-targeted gpx. one of them is typical for plants  <cit>  and two are two selenocysteine-type gpx, which are otherwise typical for animals and microbia  <cit> . this comparison suggests that the dominance of apx in the chloroplast antioxidant system  <cit>  is not ubiquitous in the plant kingdom and may mainly be characteristic for higher land plants, for which it was first described  <cit> .

chloroplast ascorbate peroxidase genes share a common evolutionary origin
similarities in the amino acid composition  and in the gene structures  demonstrate that chlamydomonas, selaginella and arabidopsis apx genes are related. the ancestral gene dates back to times before chlorophytes and streptophytes split into two lineages. besides crsapxa, which was already annotated as apx in the ncbi-database  <cit> , the chlorophyte chlamydomonas has a second gene, crsapxb, encoding a chloroplast ascorbate peroxidase   <cit> . due to specific sequence characteristics crsapxb is annotated as putative bifunctional ascorbate-cytochrome c peroxidase in peroxibase. the protein shows highest similarity to proteins encoded by red algae, but no crsapxb ortholog has been observed in any streptophyte. since the deduced amino acid sequence showed various modifications in heme and substrate coordination sites , crsapxb is very likely a non-functional pseudogene.

crsapxa has an extra-long regulatory loop between f/w <dig> and w327
compared to the other chloroplast apx , crsapxa shows two short loops on the protein surface . evaloii is placed between f/w <dig> and w <dig>  as shown by kitajima et al.  <cit>  and teixeira et al.  <cit> , the distance between this positions is extended in all chloroplast apx if compared to cytosolic and microbody-localized apx. the loop increases the susceptibility of the heme to h2o <dig>  <cit> . in crsapxa this loop is further extended by  <dig> amino acids . since for chlamydomonas sp. w <dig> a chloroplast apx, which shows a chloroplast-typical loop, was reported to be stable in the presence of excess h2o <dig> in an ascorbate-depleted medium  <cit> , a larger loop, such as evaloii, might be necessary for increasing the h2o <dig> sensitivity and enable flood gate control between h2o <dig> detoxification and h2o <dig> signaling inside chloroplasts  <cit> .

in physcomitrella, the ancestral apx is replaced by an apx of retrotransposonal origin
physcomitrella patens encodes only a tapx, but no sapx . the physcomitrella gene for the chloroplast apx has a single atypical splice site and is flanked by angela ltr retrotransponson footprints indicating a retrotransposonal origin. for physcomitrella several copia-type elements have been inserted into the genome in waves. on average, insertions took place every  <dig>  million years  <cit> . mosses separated from tracheophytes, such as ferns and seed plants,  <dig> -  <dig> million years ago. however it is not possible to precisely date retrotransposition events, the insertion may have taken place independently in the moss branch. due to the unconserved splice site , it is tempting to assume that the intron was inserted after the retro-transposition event and does not result from incomplete splicing of a retrotranscribed hnrna.

in neighborhood joining , minimal evolution and maximum parsimony trees  calculated from clustalw protein alignment of all identified and all in peroxibase listed putatively full-length plant ascorbate peroxidases, the pptapx clusters with chloroplast apx  suggesting that it originates from a chloroplast apx encoding mrna.

unlike other chloroplast apx, in pptapx at position  <dig> an arginine residue is substituted by a histidine residue. h <dig> corresponds to h <dig> in cytosolic apx of pea. the histidine side chain forms a salt bridge with the propionated side chain of the heme  <cit> . the h <dig> is typical for cytosolic apx and prevents h2o2-dependent decomposition of compound i in the absence of ascorbate  <cit>  suggesting that pptapx is less h2o2-sensitive than other chloroplast apx.

physcomitrella lacks sapx function and substituted it by prx gene multiplication
the single physcomitrella plastid apx gene encodes a tapx with a c-terminal transmembrane anchoring helix. unlike tobacco, spinach and pumpkin apx genes  <cit> , est-analysis gave no indication for alternative splicing of the hnrna into transcripts encoding thylakoid and stromal isoforms . it is concluded that physcomitrella patens lacks sapx function. studies in transgenic arabidopsis demonstrated that sapx has a stronger protective function under photooxidative stress conditions than tapx  <cit> . consequently, lack of sapx activity may limit chloroplast antioxidant protection in physcomitrella. in arabidopsis, prx expression increases in response to insufficient chloroplast apx activity  <cit> .

from the analysis of today's genome structures, it is not possible to predict whether physcomitrella has lost the ancestral apx gene prior or post to maturation of the retrotransposonal gene. the natural habitat of the moss is shady. considering the low-light environment, the phylogenetic ancestors of physcomitrella may have lost its ancestral chloroplast apx gene even before the novel gene was functionally adapted by evolution of suitable promoter elements and chloroplast targeting signals. in physcomitrella, the genes for chloroplast prx have been multiplied. compared to two 2cp, one prxii and one prxq in arabidopsis thaliana, physcomitrella patens expresses two chloroplast 2cp, two chloroplast prxii and three chloroplast prxq paralogs .

2-cys peroxiredoxins evolved independently in streptophytes and chlorophytes
2-cys peroxiredoxins are nuclear encoded chloroplast enzymes in higher plants  <cit> , but cytosolic enzymes in heterotrophic eukaryotes  <cit> . based on sequence comparison with cyanobacterial 2cp and plastome encoded 2cp from the rhodobiont porphyra purpurea, it has been postulated that higher plant 2cp are of endosymbiotic origin  <cit> . the gene structures  and sequence characteristics  demonstrated that 2cp of all analyzed streptophytes are of common origin. on the contrary, none of the 2cp genes of the chlorophyte chlamydomonas reinhardtii showed a conserved splice site and, thus, might have evolved independently.

in arabidopsis, the gene structures  and the deduced amino acid sequences  are more similar to each other than to the two 2cp genes of selaginella indicating distinct gene duplication events. since no ests were observed for sm2cpb, the gene could be a silent pseudogene. it might have started to accumulate mutations due to lack of selective pressure on the functional activity of the sm2cpb encoding gene. this hypothesis is supported by changes in otherwise conserved charged amino acid residues , a deletion in the conserved key-motif  <cit>  and the elongated n-terminus of mature sm2cpb  . these modifications change the charge of the protein surface and very likely disturb protein dimerization, which is important for formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds during the reaction cycle.

there has been a strong selective pressure on stromal prx activity
studies of 2cp antisense lines demonstrated that decreased 2cp activity can be compensated by increased induction of apx gene expression  <cit> . chloroplast apx has a by three to four magnitudes higher peroxidative activity than prx  <cit> . thus, slightly higher expression of apx could support the antioxidant protection of plants similar to a strong induction of prx. however, sequence and structural conservation  reports that there has been a strong selective pressure on the maintenance of prx, especially on 2cp, during evolution of plants. as estimated from array hybridizations and est-counts, the relative expression of 2cp is higher in arabidopsis, selaginella and chlamydomonas than apx expression. for physcomitrella, difficulties with scaffold arrangement in case of the pp2cpb gene http://www.cosmoss.org limited est sorting. one reason, which accounts for maintenance of prx could be, that they can reduce a wide range of alkyl hydroperoxides  <cit> , while apx isoforms are almost specific for h2o <dig>  <cit> . however, since gpx also detoxify alkyl hydroperoxides, prx could have been replaced by gpx.

another reason for keeping prx activity could be a better antioxidant protection in post-stress phases: upon severe oxidative stress apx and prx are inactivated  <cit> . in apx, w <dig> is cross-linked to the heme by excess h2o <dig>  <cit> . in prx the peroxidatic c is sulfinylated  <cit> . sulfinylated 2cp can be regenerated by e.g. sulfiredoxins  <cit> , while chloroplast apx are irreversibly inhibited  <cit> . this re-activation option gives 2cp a special importance during post-stress acclimation and may explain why all plants maintained prx genes during evolution. in higher plants, 2cp stability against oxidative damage is supported by accumulation of high protein amounts  <cit> . 2cp is assumed to be an ancient, stable peroxidase which is expressed prior to activation of apx in young tissues  <cit> .

chlamydomonas weakly expresses a putative cytosolic 2cp
in chlamydomonas proteins, the chloroplast targeting signals are much shorter and less hydroxylated and positively charged than targeting signals from the other enzymes analyzed . on the one hand this impedes targeting predictions, on the other hand, in chlamydomonas the single large chloroplast covers almost 90% of the cell lumen. a recent study  <cit>  demonstrated that protein import is controlled by mrna availability and localized translation.

in the chlorophyte chlamydomonas three 2cp genes were observed. their gene structure is not conserved . compared to the other 2cp analyzed in this study, the amino acid sequences of the proteins are more variable . especially in cr2cpb, the c-terminus is highly charged and modified in the key-motif   <cit> . in the c-terminus, the protein has three prolin residues, compared to four prolins in other plant 2cp and two prolins in non-plant 2cp  <cit> . taken this together with the modified charge pattern of the cterminus, cr2cpb resembles non-plant 2cp more than plant 2cp according to the criteria summarized by könig et al.  <cit> .

chlorophytes have diverged from streptophytes more than  <dig> billion years ago  <cit> . the chlorobionts share common ancestors with rhodobionts of which some, e.g. porphyra purpurea, encode 2cp in their plastomes  <cit> . many non-photosynthetic eukaryotes, including mammals and fungi, express cytosolic 2cp  <cit> . maximum parsimony analysis of amino acid similarity  indicates that the three chlamydomonas 2cp are related. amino acid sequence characteristics  and, especially, gene structure analysis  suggest that the chlorophyte either retained a cytosolic 2cp of different evolutionary origin than the chloroplast 2cp of higher plants or indicate a chloroplast 2cp with an plastid-atypical amino acid sequence.

gene structure evolution of prxii and prxq
chloroplast prxii are encoded by single exon genes in streptophytes, but by a five exon gene in chlamydomonas. despite the difference in the gene structure , they show high amino acid sequence conservation between the species . from comparison of apx, 2cp and prxq genes, it can be concluded that most intron insertions may have taken place prior to divergence of mosses, ferns and seed plants. however, sequence analysis provides no explanation why so many intron-insertions took place in the gene for chloroplast prxii of chlamydomonas or intron deletions in the streptophytes. in the streptophyte branch, consistent with genome wide comparisons  <cit> , the gene structures encoding the mature parts of prxq and apx are conserved between the analyzed species. only the intron lengths are variable in these genes. based on comparison of arabidopsis and rice genomes roy and penny  <cit>  concluded that the main difference in intron numbers results from mrna-mediated intron loss. accordingly, it is more likely that the streptophytes lost introns than that they were inserted in the chlorophyte genes.

thylakoid localization of prxq might be streptophyte specific
in arabidopsis thaliana, prxq is post-translationally targeted to the thylakoid lumen  <cit> . protein trafficking is controlled by bi-partite transit peptides  <cit> . comparison of the atprxq transit peptide with the transit peptides of the other streptophyte prxq shows similar lengths and distribution of positively charged and hydroxylated amino acid residues . in contrast, the transite peptide of crprxq is much shorter and stronger positively charged in its second half  indicating that the thylakoid lumen address is missing and the protein is targeted to the chloroplast stroma  <cit> . furthermore, crprxq lacks negative charges at position  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and positive charges at position  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  a high number of positive charges in the mature protein is characteristic for streptophyte prxq . they can be protonated upon thylakoid lumen acidification and regulate enzyme activity. several of these residues are not conserved in crprxq  suggesting a different regulation and, since the short transit peptide also gives no indication for a thylakoid-lumen targeting signal, also a different localization.

chloroplast glutathione peroxidase genes are highly conserved in streptophytes, but only weakly related to chlorophyte gpx
compared to the other investigated types of chloroplast antioxidant enzymes, the gene structure is most conserved for gpx in the streptophyte branch of the plant kingdom . in genes from physcomitrella, selaginella and arabidopsis all splice sites were absolutely conserved in the gene part encoding the mature protein. in physcomitrella one identified est may show alternative splicing of the last intron. the high conservation and the high similarity of the protein primary sequences demonstrate a strong evolutionary pressure on maintenance of gpx function. in selaginella, one pseudogene with modified gene structure and many substitutions, smgpxd, was observed . since this gene was only found in one of the two sequenced haplotypes, it may result from a late, haplotype specific gene duplication. if this was the case, it would give additional stress on the hypothesis of the high evolutionary pressure to conserve gene structures of ancient genes. the fact that an extreme extention of intron <dig> is accompanied by very low transcript coverage of ppgpxb, may support the importance of gpx gene structure conservation, such as structural organization of the pre-peptide encoding exon.

evolution of gpx genes included gene duplication and alternative splicing
it is generally assumed that gene duplication increased the gene copy number of gpx in plants  <cit> . concerning chloroplast isoforms, phylogenetic tree analysis  and comparison of amino acid residues  gave surprisingly little information on the general relation of the gpx genes. the several chloroplast gpx proteins clustered with different proteins in maximum parsimony, minimum evolution and neighborhood joining trees . however, gene structure analysis  indicates a common origin of streptophyte gpx. weak similarities in the exon-intron-structure between chlamydomonas and streptophyte gpx and co-existence of selenocysteine- and cysteine-type gpx in chlamydomonas, but not in streptophytes, demonstrates parallel independent evolution of gpx branches in chlorobionts.

in contrast to early chloroplast gpx evolution, conclusions can be drawn for the latest gpx duplication: since only single genes for chloroplast isoforms were observed in selaginella  and physcomitrella, duplication of the common ancestor gene into atgpx <dig> and atgpx <dig> may have occurred after separation of phanerophytes and seed plants. in all phylogenetic trees calculated from clustalw alignments, a single cycas protein  is the closest relative of atgpx <dig> and atgpx <dig>  without any paralogs in cycas, the final duplication may even have taken place after separation of gymnosperms and angiosperms.

in the minimum evolution and neighborhood joining trees , the most similar relatives of atgpx <dig> and atgpx <dig> are grass proteins . the other grass proteins included in the phylogenetic analysis are more similar to mitochondrial atgpx <dig>  indicating that separation of the atgpx <dig> lineage and the atgpx1/atgpx <dig> branch took place prior to separation of monocots and dicots. since the atgpx1/atgpx7-cluster compromises only spermatophyte proteins, suppgests that separation of the mitochondrial isoforms is a late event.

according to neighborhood joining analysis , the arabidopsis chloroplast proteins cluster with proteins encoded by basal gymnosperms , basal angiosperms  and liverworts . this result demonstrates that the arabidopsis chloroplast gpx proteins have been more conserved over time and are, presumably, more ancient than the mitochondrial atgpx <dig> ancestor. gpx6-like proteins clusters exclusively with grass proteins and, consequently, may be spermatophyte-specific.

protein modeling clearly separates atgpx <dig> from atgpx <dig> and atgpx <dig> , although the overall gene structures are still very similar . in selaginella, the predicted three-dimensional structure of smgpxa protein is, consistent with neighborhood joining weighted primary sequence analysis, similar to atgpx1/atgpx <dig>  on the contrary, smgpxb shows stronger structural similarity to atgpx <dig> indicating that the two newly described organellar selaginella gpx are homologues or atgpx1/atgpx <dig> and atgpx <dig>  respectively.

the most diverse gpx-types were observed in the green algae chlamydomonas . the cysteine-type gpx of chlamydomonas  has a conserved splice site with the other analyzed plant gpx between exon <dig> and exon <dig>  suggesting an evolutionary relation to streptophyte gpx. the gene structures of the selenocysteine-type gpx are non-conserved. comparison of the protein structure with human seleno-gpx demonstrated that the structure is more similar to monomeric human gpx <dig> than to tetrameric human gpx <dig> . consistent with margis et al.  <cit> , we therefore conclude that all plant gpx have evolved from a common ancestor. in chlamydomonas low sequence and gene structure similarity between the three putative organellar gpx genes reflects high diversification. in streptophytes only one branch was maintained as indicated by common exon-intron structures. additional gene duplications, such as in case of atgpx <dig> separation from the atgpx1/atgpx <dig> ancestral gene, and introduction of alternative splicing, such as in the last exon of ppgpxa, resulted in further gene diversification.

CONCLUSIONS
the study demonstrates that, irrespective of how much time was available for modifications of intron lengths and individual amino acid residues, there had been an evolutionary pressure on maintenance of all three chloroplast peroxide detoxification systems, namely apx, gpx and prx. especially adaptation of an apx retrotransposon in physcomitrella for post-translational protein import into chloroplasts and multiplication of prxq and prxii genes show the strong evolutionary pressure plants have perceived on having apx, gpx and prx controlled chloroplast antioxidant protection in parallel. gene structures demonstrate that streptophyte and chlorophyte apx genes evolved from a common ancestral gene. the structures of the prx genes, in contrast, suggest at least a partially independent evolution, which resulted in putatively non-plastidic or atypical 2cp isoforms, a potentially non-thylakoid lumen prxq and a prxii gene with three chlorophyte-specific introns in chlamydomonas. in addition, streptophytes and chlorophytes differ in their gpx patterns, with chlamydomonas expressing two seleno-gpx and one cysteine-type gpx, while only cysteine gpx are encoded in streptophytes. the comparison of model chlorobiont genomes demonstrated that the complexity and the individual components of the chloroplast antioxidant system were targets for mutations and selection. in summary, this comparison provides a new basis for analyzing the function of individual components of the chloroplast antioxidant enzyme defense with respect to plant tolerance against photooxidative stress.
