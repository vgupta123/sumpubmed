BACKGROUND
american ginseng  is a perennial understory herb from the araliaceae family, which is native to the eastern forests of north america  <cit> . it is one of the most extensively used medicinal plants in both east asia and the west as a remedy or adaptogen to promote vitality, enhance physical performance, and increase resistance to stress and aging  <cit> . the major bioactive components of american ginseng are the triterpene saponins known as ginsenosides. to date, more than  <dig> ginsenosides have been isolated from american ginseng and are classified into two main groups, the dammarane type and the oleanane type, based on the structures of their aglycones. the major ginsenosides are the dammarane type, and include rb <dig>  rc, rd, re, and rg <dig>  the oleanane type is represented by only one saponin, ro, which is a minor component in american ginseng  <cit> . each ginsenoside reportedly has different pharmacological effects, including nervous system regulation, immune system modulation, and anticancer, antioxidant, and antihypertensive activities  <cit> . ginsenosides are synthesized by the isoprenoid pathway and share the same precursor,  <dig> -oxidosqualene, with sterol  <cit> . due to the biological importance of sterol, the common steps in its conversion from acetyl-coa to  <dig> -oxidosqualene have been widely studied in many plant species. the cyclization of oxidosqualene is the branch point for the biosynthesis of ginsenosides and phytosterols. the  <dig> -oxidosqualene cyclases  that synthesize β-amyrin  <cit>  and dammarenediol-ii  <cit>  have been characterized in panax ginseng; however, the portion of the pathway that lies downstream of cyclization remains largely unknown. according to the proposed pathway , some specific cyp450s and udp-glycosyltransferases  may catalyze the conversion of dammarenediol-ii or β-amyrin to various ginsenosides  <cit> . to date, no cyp450s or ugts involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis have been identified from american ginseng or other ginsenoside-producing plants.

the sequencing and analysis of ests are the primary tools for the discovery of novel genes, especially in non-model plants for which full genome sequencing is not economically feasible. est sequencing represents a rapid and relatively economical method for analyzing the transcribed region of the genome  <cit> . furthermore, est analyses have identified the genes involved in plant secondary metabolism. for example, a licorice-amyrin 11-oxidase gene was successfully identified by the analysis of a collection of ests from the stolons of glycyrrhiza uralensis; this gene encodes a cyp <dig> that plays a key role in the biosynthesis of the triterpene sweetener glycyrrhizin  <cit> . additionally, a dammarenediol synthase was functionally characterized from the ests generated from a p. ginseng flower cdna library  <cit> . ests can also be used for other functional genomic projects, including gene expression profiling, microarrays, molecular markers, and physical mapping  <cit> .

over the last few years, next-generation sequencing  technologies have led to a revolution in genomics and genetics and provided cheaper and faster delivery of sequencing information  <cit> . the first commercial ngs platform,  <dig> gs <dig> http://www. <dig> com, was released in  <dig> and produces about  <dig>  reads with an average read length of  <dig> bases per run  <cit> . since then,  <dig> sequencing technology has experienced a rapid improvement in throughput, read length, and accuracy. now, the newest  <dig> sequencing platform, the gs flx titanium, can generate one million reads with an average length of  <dig> bases at  <dig> % accuracy per run. to date, the  <dig> pyrosequencing technique is the most widely used ngs technology for the de novo sequencing and analysis of transcriptomes in non-model organisms.

despite the commercial and medicinal importance of american ginseng, little genomic research has been performed with this species. in this study, with the roche gs flx titanium platform, we obtained more than  <dig>  high-quality  reads from a cdna library generated from an american ginseng root. those reads were assembled into  <dig>  unique transcripts, containing  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. the average lengths of the hq reads and the contigs were comparable to those generated from an american ginseng root cdna library in our previous study using the sanger method  <cit> . bioinformatic analysis indicated that all genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the ginsenoside backbone existed in the transcriptome of the american ginseng root. furthermore, a few candidate genes putatively responsible for ginsenoside backbone modifications were screened out of a gene pool containing  <dig> cyp <dig> and  <dig> ugt unique sequences. to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first exploration to discover the genes responsible for triterpene saponin biosynthesis through the analysis of large-scale ests produced from a next-generation sequencer. additionally, the method described here can be widely applied to the profiling of transcriptomes, facilitating the discovery of novel genes in other non-model organisms.

RESULTS
sequencing and de novo assembly of  <dig> ests
a cdna library constructed by smart technology from the total rna of an american ginseng root was subjected to a one-quarter plate run with the  <dig> gs flx titanium platform. this one-quarter run produced  <dig>  hq reads with an average sequence length of  <dig> bases . of the hq reads,  <dig> % contained more than  <dig> bases, whereas  <dig> % had more than  <dig> bases. the size distribution of the reads is shown in figure 2-a. after trimming the adapter sequences and removing the short sequences of less than  <dig> bases,  <dig>  reads remained for assembly with an average length of  <dig> ±  <dig> bases. a total of  <dig>  mb of hq sequence data were generated, of which  <dig>  mb  were used for assembly. all hq reads were also deposited in the national center for biotechnology information  and can be accessed in the short read archive  under the accession number srx <dig>  an overview of the sequencing and assembly is given in table  <dig> 

the reads produced by the gs flx titanium platform were long enough for de novo assembly. therefore, size-selected reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs by roche newbler software, while  <dig>  reads remained as singletons. the sequencing coverage ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  fold, with an average 8-fold coverage. in total,  <dig>  reads were assembled into contigs, accounting for  <dig> % of the assembled reads. contigs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bases, with an average size of  <dig> ±  <dig> bases. about  <dig> % of the contigs were assembled from three or more reads. the size distribution for these contigs is shown in figure 2-b.

functional annotation by sequence comparison with public databases
all unique sequences were first compared with the sequences in the non-redundant database  of the ncbi using the blastn algorithm and were then compared with the sequences in the three major public protein databases  using the blastx algorithm. when the e-value cutoff was set at 10- <dig>  a total of  <dig>  unique sequences were annotated, which accounted for  <dig> % of the total unique sequences. under a more stringent condition ,  <dig>  unique sequences were annotated, which accounted for  <dig> % of the total unique sequences .

of all the contigs, a total of  <dig> contained more than  <dig>  reads, which represented the most abundant transcripts in the  <dig> est cdna library . the  <dig> most abundant transcripts included some that encoded abundant root proteins that were previously characterized in chinese ginseng  or american ginseng , such as ribonuclease-like storage protein, p. quinquefolius-specific abundant protein-like protein  <dig>  and p. ginseng major latex-like protein   <cit> . the most abundant transcript, which had  <dig>  reads, was annotated as "regulator of ribonuclease-like protein  <dig> " a possible inhibitor of the endonuclease activity of rnase. interestingly, we also found an abundant transcript encoding rnase  <dig>  it is not surprising that some transcripts encoding the enzymes involved in sugar and energy metabolism were highly expressed, because starch is the most abundant component of the american ginseng root, and these enzymes included sucrose synthase and  <dig>  4-alpha-glucan-branching enzyme. some transcripts encoding peroxidases were also highly expressed, and these enzymes may play a role in resistance to abiotic or biotic stresses  <cit> .

functional classification by kegg
functional classification and pathway assignment was performed by the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes . first, the  <dig>  unique sequences were compared using blastx with an e-value cutoff of <10- <dig> against the kegg database. of these unique sequences,  <dig>   had significant matches in the database sequences. among those,  <dig>  unique sequences having enzyme commission  numbers were assigned to metabolic pathways. as shown in additional file  <dig>  the kegg metabolic pathways that were well represented by the american ginseng unique sequences were carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, and lipid metabolism. in the subclass of secondary metabolism, the greatest number of unique sequences was mapped to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and limonene and pinene degradation. ginsenosides belong to the terpenoid saponins, which share a common pathway from acetyl-coa to  <dig> -oxidosqualene with sterol; therefore, we focused more of our attention on sterol and terpenoid biosynthesis. surprisingly, in the kegg map of sterol biosynthesis , most enzymes were mapped to transcripts in the  <dig> cdna library and included all of the enzymes involved in sterol backbone synthesis and in brassinosteroid and stigmasterol biosynthesis. this result demonstrated the powerful ability of high-throughput sequencing to identify genes in metabolic pathways.

candidate enzymes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis
oscs and other known enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of ginsenoside backbones
as shown in figure  <dig>  it is generally thought that ginsenosides are synthesized via the mevalonate pathway. based on the kegg pathway assignment, we found all of the genes encoding enzymes involved in ginsenoside backbone biosynthesis . in most cases, more than one unique sequence was annotated as the same enzyme. such unique sequences may represent different fragments of a single transcript, different members of a gene family, or both.

contig <dig>  contig <dig> 
contig <dig>  contig <dig> 
the cyclization of  <dig> -oxidosqualene is the branch point of sterol and ginsenoside biosynthesis and controls the carbon flux through the branched biosynthetic pathways. four osc genes of american ginseng, cycloartenol synthase   <cit> , dammarenediol-ii synthase   <cit> , β-amyrin synthase  <dig> , and β-amyrin synthase  <dig>   <cit> , exist in the  <dig> cdna library. we investigated their expression levels in different plant tissues by real-time pcr. as shown in figure 3-a, ds was highly expressed in all selected tissues, and its highest expression was found in flowers. in contrast, cas expression was the lowest in flowers. furthermore, cas was expressed at a lower level than ds in other tissues. compared with ds and cas, as <dig> and as <dig> displayed a low level of expression in all tested tissues. in fact, as <dig> transcripts were not detected in the leaves. we also compared the results from the real-time pcr and est number counting . their significant agreement indicated that the abundance of the  <dig> sequences from the non-normalized cdna library closely mirrors the actual expression level, although amplification can introduce some biases.

cytochrome p450s
cytochrome p <dig> proteins are the largest family of plant proteins and catalyze most of the oxidation steps in plant secondary metabolism  <cit> . in the biosynthetic pathway of dammarane-type ginsenosides, two steps are catalyzed by cyp450s: the conversion from dammarane to protopanaxadiol and the conversion from protopanaxadiol to protopanaxatriol. a total of  <dig> unique sequences,  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons, were annotated as cyp450s . to find the cyp450s involved in dammarane-type ginsenoside biosynthesis, these unique sequences were further screened according to classification, abundance, meja inducibility, and tissue-specific expression. as shown in figure  <dig>  dammarane and protopanaxadiol, which are triterpenes, have a structure that is similar to plant sterols. thus far, all known triterpenes and sterol hydroxylases have been classified into two clans: the cyp <dig> clan and the cyp <dig> clan  <cit> . ds had  <dig> ests, and we estimated that the cyp450s of moderate abundance were more likely to be involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis. therefore, a total of  <dig> cyp450s containing 4- <dig> reads, which belonged to the cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> clans, were chosen for the meja inducibility experiment. the plant signaling compound meja induces or increases the biosynthesis of many secondary metabolites  <cit> . it has been reported that meja stimulates ginsenoside production in cultured ginseng cells  <cit>  and adventitious roots  <cit> , and up-regulates the genes involved in the biosynthesis of dammarane-type ginsenosides, such as ss , squalene epoxidase , ds  <cit> . as shown in figure 4-a, ds expression increased about 6-fold after meja treatment. six cyp450s were up-regulated by meja, while eight cyp450s were down-regulated. the expression pattern of the six cyp450s in different tissues was then determined by real-time pcr. as shown in figure 4-b, the highest level of ds expression was in the flower, while its expression in other three tissue types was much lower. of all six cyp450s, only contig <dig> had a similar tissue-specific expression pattern as ds, indicating that contig <dig> and ds were coexpressed in different tissues. this result suggests that the two enzymes may be located in the same biosynthetic pathway. contig <dig> was classified into the cyp <dig> family, which is close to the cyp <dig> family in the phylogenetic tree of arabidopsis thaliana cyp450s. recently, cyp88d <dig> from glycyrrhiza was identified as β-amyrin 11-oxidase, one of two characterized triterpenes hydroxylases  <cit> . therefore, contig <dig> is a promising candidate that may catalyze the oxidation of dammarane or protopanaxadiol.

glycosyltransferases
glycosyltransferases are another large multigene family in plants. in general, glycosylation is the last step in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. from a chemical point of view, sugar conjugation results in both increased stability and water solubility  <cit> . the  <dig> cdna library contained  <dig> glycosyltransferase unique sequences composed of  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons . thus far, almost all functionally characterized glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites belong to ugts and have a so-called plant secondary product glycosyltransferase  motif, which is generally located in the c-terminal portion of the protein  <cit> . unique sequences containing the pspg motif were selected by a pspg motif search in the glycosyltransferase pool. the remaining glycosyltransferases were screened again by annotation to avoid missing target sequences because most of them are not full-length sequences. the glycosyltransferases were picked up, which were annotated as the ugts obviously involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. in total,  <dig> ugts were selected and contained reads that varied from  <dig> to  <dig> bases. among them, a total of  <dig> ugts were up-regulated by meja, whereas only three ugts were obviously down-regulated in the meja inducibility experiment . in the tissue-specific expression pattern assay, among  <dig> up-regulated ugts by meja, the expression pattern of four ugts showed strong similarity to that of ds . these ugts included contig <dig>  contig <dig>  contig <dig>  and contig <dig>  they were regarded as candidate ugts encoding enzymes responsible for ginsenoside biosynthesis and will be the subject of further study.

discussion
est analysis is one of the most popular tools for gene discovery. however, deep est sequencing using the sanger method is time-consuming, labor intensive, and expensive. with the development of ngs technologies, these limitations have been overcome, and est analysis is becoming the premier choice for gene discovery on a genome-wide scale in non-model plants. in addition to advantages with regard to cost and speed, another major advantage of the ngs platform is elimination of the bacterial cloning step that can bias the composition of the cdna library. to date, roche gs flx is the most widely used ngs platform for de novo est sequencing. using this technology, a number of est libraries have been successfully constructed from plants, including maize  <cit> , chestnut  <cit> , olive  <cit> , the model plant a. thaliana  <cit> , and the medicinal herb artemisia annua  <cit> , as well as fish  <cit> , insects  <cit> , and worms  <cit> .

in this study, we produced more than  <dig>  hq reads in a one-quarter run with the roche  <dig> gs flx titanium platform. to avoid the negative effect of polya on sequencing quality, a cdna library preparation based on smart technology was improved by the removal of polya with bsgi digestion, leading to an approximately 40% increase in sequencing output . although the roche  <dig> company now prefers to resolve the polya problem by cdna synthesis primed with random hexamers, our study proved that enzyme digestion is at least an effective alternative way to eliminate polya and is a promising method in  <dig> cdna library preparation starting from total rna.

based on de novo sequencing and analysis of the american ginseng root, we found all of the known genes encoding enzymes involved in ginsenoside backbone biosynthesis, including oscs: ds, and as. cyclization of  <dig> -oxidosqualene is the branch point of sterol and ginsenoside biosynthesis, and oscs play important roles in the control of carbon flux through different metabolic branches. est number counting and real time pcr demonstrated that in the root of american ginseng, ds expression was highest, followed by cas, and finally as. this result suggested that the biosynthesis of dammarane-type ginsenosides is more active than the biosynthesis of phytosterols or oleanolic acid-type ginsenosides. surprisingly, based on the kegg pathway assignment, we found all of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of brassinosteroid, a phytosteroid hormone. we estimated that expression of the brassinosteroid biosynthetic genes is lower than that of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of dammarane-type ginsenosides. therefore, these results strongly indicate that most of the genes involved in the synthesis of dammarane-type ginsenosides are contained within the  <dig> cdna library.

as compared to ginsenoside backbone biosynthesis, we know little about the late stages of ginsenoside biosynthesis. this part of the pathway includes multiple oxidation and glycosylation steps catalyzed by enzymes from the cyp <dig> and glycosyltransferase superfamilies, respectively. these families of enzymes display a wide range of substrate specificities and are responsible for the diversity of many plant secondary metabolites. about  <dig> ugt genes and  <dig> cyp <dig> genes were identified in the model plant a. thaliana. because of the biological, pharmacological, and agricultural importance of secondary metabolites, ugts and cyp450s have attracted considerable interest for decades, but only a few have been characterized by traditional biochemistry and genetics. in the dammarane-type ginsenoside biosynthetic pathway, cyp450s catalyze the c <dig> hydroxylation of dammarenediol-ii and the c <dig> hydroxylation of protopanaxadiol, while glycosylation generally occurs on c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> of the aglycones. to date, only two cyp450s involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis are functionally characterized: cyp88d <dig>  a β-amyrin 11-oxidase from glycyrrhiza uralensis  <cit>  and cyp93e <dig>  a β-amyrin and sophoradiol 24-hydroxylase from glycine max  <cit> . also, three ugts in triterpene saponin biosynthesis have been identified: ugt73k <dig> and ugt71g <dig> from medicago truncatula  <cit> and ugt <dig> m <dig> from saponaria vaccaria  <cit> . however, all of the aforementioned enzymes are involved in oleanane-type ginsenoside biosynthesis. no cyp450s or ugts in the dammarenediol-type ginsenoside biosynthetic pathway have been previously functionally characterized. therefore, this study focused on the discovery of cyp450s and ugts involved in the biosynthesis of dammarenediol-type ginsenosides, which are the major ginsenoside type in the american ginseng root.

compared to the traditional sanger method,  <dig> pyrosequencing provides a tremendous genetic resource in a fast and economical way. in total,  <dig> cyp <dig> unique sequences and  <dig> ugt unique sequences were found in the american ginseng cdna library. we only found  <dig> cyp450s  and two ugts  from more than  <dig>  sanger ests in our previous study  <cit> . with regard to the est analysis of another panax genus plant, p. ginseng, four cyp450s and four ugts were found from about  <dig>  ests generated from the p. ginseng leaf  <cit> ; nine cyp450s and  <dig> ugts were found from more than  <dig>  ests from five ginseng library  <cit> . however, the large number of candidate genes produced by  <dig> pyrosequencing leads to difficulty in the characterization of the enzymes that are actually involved in this pathway. therefore, meja inducibility experiments and tissue-specific expression pattern assays were carried out to eliminate the cyp450s and ugts that were not involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis. after this screening, only one cyp <dig> and four ugt unique sequences were selected. they will ultimately be identified by their heterologous expression in escherichia coli or yeast and then by an in vitro enzymatic assay. a similar procedure was previously described in the characterization of other cyp450s or ugts involved in the biosynthesis of triterpene saponins <cit> . based on the knowledge that many secondary metabolites can be induced by meja and that most of the enzymes in the same pathway are coexpressed, the meja inducibility experiments and the tissue-specific expression pattern assays are useful in the identification of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.

CONCLUSIONS
american ginseng is a suitable subject for the study of triterpene saponin  biosynthesis. the identification of enzymes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis not only facilitates functional studies in the plant but also sets the stage for improving production levels in plant or microbial hosts by metabolic engineering. based on de novo sequencing and analysis of the transcriptome using the roche gs flx titanium platform, we found all of the known genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the ginsenoside backbone and established a gene pool containing  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> and  <dig> glycosyltransferase unique sequences. these enzymes represent two of the most important superfamilies in high plants, and a large number of them are involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. more importantly, a few candidate genes encoding enzymes responsible for hydroxylation and glycosylation in the ginsenoside biosynthetic pathway were obtained by screening with functional annotation and conducting meja inducibility experiments and tissue-specific expression pattern analyses. additionally, this study represents the first example of a large-scale est analysis from the araliaceae family. these est data will provide the foundation for other functional genomic research in american ginseng or its closely related species, such as p. ginseng and p. notoginseng.
