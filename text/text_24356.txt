BACKGROUND
the protein kinase d  family of serine/threonine kinases comprises a single member in drosophila  <cit> , two isoforms in c. elegans  <cit>  and three members, pkd <dig> , pkd <dig> and pkd <dig>  in mammals. the three mammalian isoforms share similar structural modules. they consist of an n-terminal regulatory domain and a c-terminal kinase domain. while pkd <dig> and pkd <dig> posses an alanine/proline-rich region at their n-terminus, in pkd <dig> this hydrophobic domain is absent. all isoforms contain two cysteine-rich domains  separated by a long linker region, an acidic region consisting of negatively charged amino acids and a pleckstrin homology domain . these characteristic motifs are also important for the regulation of enzyme activity and localization within cells. the pkd enzymes have recently been implicated in very diverse cellular functions, including golgi organization and plasma membrane directed transport, metastasis, immune responses, apoptosis and cell proliferation . pkd <dig> was originally identified in  <dig>  <cit> . northern blot analysis revealed a ubiquitous expression of the protein in a wide variety of human tissues suggesting a basic housekeeping function  <cit> . in vitro studies propose a potential role of the kinase in signaling events of gpcr agonists which induced a rapid activation of pkd <dig> by a protein kinase c -dependent pathway  <cit> . pkd <dig> can also be activated by bombesin in a rac and gα dependent mechanism  <cit> . moreover, pkd <dig> was implicated to play a role in b cell antigen receptor signaling by phosphorylating class ii hdac <dig> and  <dig> thereby promoting nuclear export of these proteins  <cit> . activation of pkd <dig> in these cells involves the phosphorylation of the activation loop serines which is mediated by a dag-plc-pkc-dependent pathway. putative upstream kinases for pkd <dig> are pkcε, pkcη or pkcθ  <cit> . according to the localization of the kinase at the trans-golgi network   <cit> , a function in the formation of exocytotic transport carriers has been described  <cit> . recently, it could be demonstrated that pkd <dig> and pkd <dig> dimerize at the tgn and regulate membrane fission  <cit> . however, there is also substantial evidence that pkd <dig> has a distinct and non-redundant function within the pkd family. compared to pkd <dig> and  <dig>  pkd3-specific direct substrates at the tgn have not been identified yet  <cit> . a pdz domain identified in pkd <dig> and  <dig> is lacking in pkd <dig>  <cit> . moreover, pkd <dig> and pkd <dig>  but not pkd <dig>  are targets for pkcδ in response to oxidative stress, because pkd <dig> lacks the relevant tyrosine residue that generates a pkcδ interaction motif  <cit> . pkd <dig> also localizes to vesicular structures that are part of the endocytic compartment. this localization may be mediated by the interaction of pkd <dig> with the vesicle-associated membrane protein vamp <dig>  <cit> . in l <dig> skeletal muscle cells, a specific role for pkd <dig> in basal glucose uptake could be demonstrated  <cit> .

the functional activities of pkd <dig> described so far are derived from in vitro studies performed with established cell lines. transgenic mouse models, which allow interference with endogenous pkd <dig>  are not available. consequently, the in vivo functions of pkd <dig> remain unknown so far. in a recent report, oster and colleagues described the expression of pkd isoforms during mouse embryogenesis using in situ hybridization techniques  <cit> . in early stages of development, pkd <dig> mrna was clearly detected in the heart, nasal processes and limb buds. during later stages of development, pkd <dig> transcript was more or less ubiquitously present. in an independent study, we have investigated the expression of pkd <dig> protein by immunohistochemistry on sagittal sections of mouse embryos using a pkd <dig> specific antibody. we here describe pkd <dig> protein expression in developmental stage e <dig> through e <dig>  of the mouse.

RESULTS
specificity of the pkd <dig> antibody
the affinity purified polyclonal pkd <dig> specific antibody used in this study was generated by immunization of rabbits with a peptide corresponding to the c-terminal epitope of human pkd <dig> . this epitope is conserved in the mouse orthologous gene, but not present in pkd <dig> or pkd <dig> isoforms . to demonstrate that the antibody is specific for pkd <dig> and not cross-reactive with pkd <dig> and pkd <dig>  we performed western blot analysis. total cell lysates of hek293t cells transiently transfected with plasmids encoding gfp-tagged human pkd <dig>  gfp-tagged human pkd <dig>  and human flag-tagged pkd <dig> were analyzed . the pkd3-specific antibody detected flag-pkd <dig>  migrating at about  <dig> kda, and endogenous pkd <dig>  migrating at about  <dig> kda, but not pkd <dig> or pkd <dig>  thus demonstrating the specificity of the reagent. since no pkd <dig> mutants are available, the antibody could not be tested in a pkd <dig> deficient background. we have therefore applied several approaches to confirm specificity of the pkd <dig> antibody used here; control staining procedures performed without the primary antibody or with rabbit preimmune-serum were all negative. various antibody dilutions  had no effect on the staining pattern . in addition, we performed staining with either flag-specific mouse monoclonal or gfp-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies that was negative, too .

pkd <dig> expression in early and later stages of development
performing immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections of mouse embryos at developmental stage e <dig> – e <dig>  we obtained histological details of pkd <dig> expression.

in e <dig>  the most prominent expression was evident in the developing heart . cells forming the ventricular and atrial chambers showed a strong staining . this strong expression in the heart was visible from early to late stages of embryonic development . recent work suggests an important role for the pkd kinase family in cardiac myocytes. the expression of pkd <dig> and pkd <dig> or pkd <dig> was demonstrated in neonatal and adult rat ventricular myocytes as well as adult mouse, rat, rabbit, and human myocardium . of note, the pkd expression seems to be subject to developmental regulation and declines significantly in adulthood  <cit> . furthermore, studies with transgenic mice revealed a role for pkd <dig> in pathological cardiac remodeling. cardiac-specific expression of a constitutive active pkd <dig> in vivo caused hypertrophy, chamber dilation, and impaired systolic function  <cit> . conversely, mice with a cardiac specific pkd <dig> knock-out demonstrated an impaired response to stress signals that normally lead to cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and fetal gene activation  <cit> . there is substantial evidence that this phenotype is associated with the pkd-mediated phosphorylation of class ii hdac <dig>  however, each pkd isoform is capable of phosphorylating class ii hdacs on the serines that mediate nuclear export via interaction with 14-3- <dig> proteins  <cit> , suggesting that pkd family members could act redundant. although the diminished hypertrophic response of pkd <dig> cardiac knock-out mice indicates that pkd <dig> and  <dig> cannot fully compensate for the loss of pkd <dig> it is likely that the residual hypertrophy and fetal gene activation in these animals reflects redundant functions of cardiac pkd <dig> and  <dig> 

in addition, pkd <dig> was expressed in the nasal processes  and forelimb buds . these observations are in line with previously published data on mrna distribution at this stage  <cit> . on top of this, an obvious pkd <dig> expression was also visible in the embryonic mesoderm. especially somite derived structures forming the dermomyotome  and the notochord  were pkd <dig> positive. of note, pkd <dig> was not expressed in erythrocytes present in the atrium and the dorsal aorta . in contrast to in situ hybridization studies  <cit>  pkd <dig> protein could not be detected in the forebrain or midbrain region at this stage. this might be due to low levels of pkd <dig> mrna at this stage  <cit> , which might result in low protein levels that are difficult to detect and/or additional regulation of pkd <dig> expression at the posttranscriptional level in this tissue.

in embryonic stage e <dig>  pkd <dig> expression was detectable in additional tissues . parts of the head region near the developing base of the scull and nasal process  were positive for pkd <dig> protein. pkd <dig> expression was visible in and along the notochord, where sclerotomic material is condensed to form the centrum of the axis . a strong pkd <dig> expression was detected in the bronchus of the lung bud  restricted to the cytoplasm of the epithelium. pkd <dig> expression in the cardiac muscle cells was still obvious . moreover, pkd <dig> was expressed in the wall of the dorsal aorta at this stage .

in embryonic stage e <dig>  more cytological details of pkd <dig> expression were visible . pkd <dig> was detected in the cartilage primordium of nasal bones , the temporal bones  and the vertebra . pkd <dig> expression was still detectable in the notochord  and in cardiomyocytes forming the ventricular and atrial chambers but was absent from the atrio-ventricular bulbar cushion tissue . further, the membrane of the oesophagus showed a strong pkd <dig> expression . within the lung strong pkd <dig> expression was found in epithelial cells of segmental bronchii . pkd <dig> expression is also observed in the urogenital ridge surrounding the lumen of the urogenital sinus . moreover, pkd <dig> expression now became detectable in the developing brain, with a prominent staining of the outer layer of the choroid plexus within the fourth ventricle . in the stomach, the mucous membrane was pkd <dig> positive .

in embryonic stage e <dig>  pkd <dig> was found to be more or less ubiquitously expressed . in addition to pkd <dig> positive structures like cardiomyocytes , the protein could also be detected in further muscle structures: skeletal muscle cells of the neck region  as well as muscles of the tongue  showed strong pkd <dig> expression. in the lung, the epithelial layer of the segmental but not the main bronchi was positive . a prominent pkd <dig> expression could be detected in the middle layer  of the stomach, but not the inner layer  . prominent sites of pkd <dig> expression were also detected in the marginal layer of the spinal cord  and the choroid plexus within the fourth ventricle . expression of pkd <dig> was also detected in the developing bones. especially the cartilage primordium of turbinate bones  and osteoblasts in the vertebrae which secrete bone material into previously existing cartilage matrix were intensively stained . the membranous layer surrounding cartilage during ossification, the perichondrium, was also positive for pkd <dig> expression . of note, the ventricular zone of the neocortex as well as the liver was negative .

pkd <dig> expression in osteoblasts was even more prominent in stage e <dig>  in developing bones of the spinal column . the nucleus pulposus in the middle of the spinal disc was also intensively stained . skeletal muscle cells of the diaphragm  also showed a strong pkd <dig> expression. oster and colleagues failed to detect elevated levels of pkd <dig> mrna in skeletal muscle by in situ hybridization  <cit> . the reason for this seeming discrepancy is unclear and might be of technical nature or reflect the fact that the level of mrna does not necessarily correlate with the protein level.

in this stage we found a strong expression in the kidney capsule , in terminal bronchioles of the lung , in the nuclei of distinct cells of the liver  as well as in the middle layer of the duodenum . in the brain, pkd <dig> expression was ubiquitously detected with exception of the neocortex, which was negative . interestingly, in the medulla oblongata distinct nerve tracts were intensively stained for pkd <dig> ; moreover, the choroid plexus within the fourth and lateral ventricle was also positive . in accordance with published data on pkd <dig> mrna expression  <cit>  the inner layer of the retina shows a weak pkd <dig> specific staining, whereas the extrinsic ocular muscle displays a strong expression of pkd <dig> . interestingly, cells within the olfactory epithelium displayed a strong pkd <dig> signal within the nuclei . the root sheath of the whisker follicles showed a steady pkd <dig> expression in e <dig>  and e <dig>  . furthermore, the suprabasal layer of the epidermis as well as underlying connective tissue  are positive for pkd <dig>  the epidermal staining was impressively evident in the mouth region where pkd <dig> negative endoderm and pkd <dig> positive ectoderm derived epidermal layers came into direct contact . pkd <dig> is also expressed in the first primordium of the upper molar tooth , which is formed by an incorporation of dental epithelium.

pkd <dig> was found to be more ore less ubiquitously expressed in embryonic stage e <dig>  . particularly strong pkd <dig> expression was detected in nerve tracts in the pons  and the choroid plexus of the lateral and fourth ventricle . the middle layer  but not the mucosa or the muscle layer  demonstrated pkd <dig> expression. in contrast to e <dig> , the submucosa of the stomach showed only a weak pkd <dig> expression, however, smooth muscle cells in the muscularis layer of the stomach were still pkd <dig> negative . within the liver pkd <dig> expression seemed to be further increased , which is in accordance with high mrna levels detected by in situ hybridization in e <dig>   <cit> . the strong pkd <dig> expression in the kidney capsule  and in the terminal bronchi of the lung  detected in e <dig>  was even more evident. in the region of the lower lip, the intensive staining of the suprabasal layer of the epidermis was obvious . all skeletal muscle cells within the embryo showed a strong pkd <dig> expression  e.g. intercostal muscle cells  and the transverse muscle fibers of the tongue . interestingly, pkd <dig> distribution in skeletal muscle cells of the diaphragm  and the neck region  is polarized, especially visible in cross-sections . of note, pkd <dig> was not detected in smooth muscle cells and in the thymus at this stage. interestingly, oster and colleagues could detect pkd <dig> mrna in the thymus at e <dig>   <cit> . in line with this, western blot analysis revealed a strong pkd <dig> expression in the thymus of adult animals , suggesting an increase in the expression level of pkd <dig> protein in neonatal mice.

CONCLUSIONS
the expression pattern of pkd <dig> reveals a tissue selective expression at stage e <dig>  which became more abundant and distributed later on during embryonic development. our data are in accordance with previously published results on pkd <dig> mrna levels using in situ hybridization analysis  <cit> . on top of that, we provide a comprehensive study on the expression pattern of pkd <dig> during organogenesis discovering additional histological details. the strong expression of pkd <dig> in specific tissues, e.g. cardiac and skeletal muscle, points to an important role for this kinase in the development of these tissues. pkd <dig> has been implicated in the regulation of secretory transport processes at the golgi compartment  <cit>  as well as regulation of basal glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells  <cit> , both of which are important processes during organogenesis. moreover, pkd <dig> has been shown to regulate the nuclear localization and thus activity of its physiological substrates class ii hdac <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, class ii hdac proteins play an important role in heart development and function  <cit> . it will now be exciting to investigate the potential function of pkd <dig> in these tissues using transgenic mouse models, interfering with endogenous pkd <dig> function by overexpression of a dominant-negative protein or deletion of the pkd <dig> gene .
