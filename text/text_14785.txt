BACKGROUND
expression of transgenes in bacteria is routinely accomplished by expressing the gene from an extrachromosomal plasmid. however, chromosomal expression, with its single-copy nature and inherent stability, is preferable in many situations. for example, in experiments where physiological levels of protein are desired, including genetic complementation experiments, even low copy number plasmids can yield non-physiological levels of expression making single-copy expression a better choice  <cit> . in addition, interpretation of experiments involving plasmids can often be confounded by the heterogeneity of the population arising from plasmid loss due to the imperfect segregation of most plasmids  <cit> . recent experiments in salmonella have shown that merely having a plasmid present in a strain can have an effect on virulence  <cit> . an additional difficulty with plasmids is that a selection is required to maintain them during growth. typically this is provided by a drug-resistance  marker, however drugr markers are undesirable in some contexts such as when bacteria will be introduced into humans . expression of transgenes from the chromosome bypasses the sub-ideal features of plasmid-based expression. however, most systems for transgene insertion are somewhat cumbersome, involving multiple steps, and also require a drugr marker to allow selection for relatively rare integration events  <cit> . those that do not involve drug selection rely on other selection strategies that involve multiple steps  <cit> . we describe a system that makes chromosomal transgene expression, with all its advantages, and without need of a selection, so simple to achieve that it can be routinely used.

we have developed a system for chromosomal transgene insertion that does not require a selection for transgene insertion based on the site-specific recombination system of the bacterial transposon, tn <dig>  tn <dig> uses five proteins for transposition, tnsabcde  <cit> . tnsa and tnsb form the transposase that recognizes approximately  <dig> bp sequences at the ends of tn <dig> and does the breakage and joining reactions of transposition, moving the transposon into the new site. tnsd and tnse are alternative site selectors that determine where the transposon will insert, and tnsc links tnsa and tnsb to the site selectors, activating transposition through regulation of the atp-bound state of tnsc. tnse mediates transposition into conjugative plasmids, whereas tnsd promotes site-specific transposition into a chromosomal "safe haven" attachment site  at the 3' end of the glms gene. tnsd recognizes a site in the highly conserved glms gene , and inserts immediately downstream of glms into atttn <dig>  such that no gene is disrupted, and at no discernable fitness cost to the host  <cit> . in cells expressing tnsabcd, transposition occurs exclusively into atttn <dig>  and not into other locations  <cit> . tn <dig> appears to have a broad host range, having been demonstrated to function in many species of bacteria  <cit> .

our overall strategy is as follows: tnsabcd and a transgene flanked by recognition sites for the tranposase are delivered into cells on a temperature-sensitive plasmid that can later be cured. we use transformation  to establish a culture of plasmid-bearing cells, induce expression of the tnsabcd proteins to promote transposition into the atttn <dig> site, and then cure the plasmid. using this strategy the majority of cells treated acquire a transgene insertion at atttn <dig>  as detailed below.

RESULTS
our integration system consists of a plasmid  carrying two key components: a multiple cloning site for transgene insertion flanked by the left and right ends of tn <dig>  and the tnsabcd genes expressed under control of the pbad promoter  <cit> . tnsabcd are outside the transposon ends, so that they will not be inserted into the chromosome during transposition. the plasmid carries arac to mediate arabinose-inducible expression of tnsabcd genes, and a temperature-sensitive origin from psc <dig>  <cit>  to allow curing of the plasmid after transgene insertion. it also has a bla gene for plasmid selection, and an origin of transfer, orit, to allow delivery by conjugation.

transgene insertions are generated as follows : first a transgene is cloned into the multiple cloning site. then, the plasmid is introduced into cells by transformation or conjugation, and a population of cells carrying the plasmid is established by selecting ampicillin resistance at 32°c on lb solid medium. these cells are then grown non-selectively in lb medium. some bacteria may require arabinose induction of tnsabcd during this growth step, but in e. coli leaky expression without induction by arabinose is sufficient. when the cultures are saturated, they are plated on lb medium at 42°c for individual colonies that are then screened for presence of the transgene by pcr across atttn <dig>  table  <dig> shows that the majority  of colonies so isolated carry the transgene insertion at atttn <dig>  all colonies consisted of ampicillin-sensitive cells, indicating that the plasmid was lost. thus, the frequency of insertion is high enough that a selection is not required to identify insertions.

recombination mediated by tnsabcd is well documented to yield tn <dig> insertion only at atttn <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that in this system cells should not acquire a transgene at sites other than atttn <dig>  however, to confirm this, we assayed for insertion events at other sites as follows. we used a chloramphenicol-resistant  transgene to allow selection for all insertion events and selected chlr cells directly. we find that, after the procedure described above,  <dig> ± 8% of cells in a culture are chlr . this is comparable to the frequency of tn <dig> insertion into atttn <dig>  when no selection is applied . all chlr colonies tested  carry the mini-tn <dig> at the attachment site . we conclude that tnsabcd are delivering the tn <dig> specifically to atttn <dig>  as expected from the many studies of tn <dig> site-specific recombination, though our frequency of 79% is a much higher frequency than the 10- <dig> reported previously using other in vivo tn <dig> transposition assays  <cit> .

although the above experiment confirms that insertion is specific to atttn <dig>  we wanted to further ensure that this system was not promoting insertions at other sites, given the extraordinary frequency of transposon insertion observed. to detect rare non-atttn <dig> insertion events, we made use of a property of tn <dig> known as transposition immunity whereby tn <dig> blocks transposition into a site already occupied by a tn <dig>  <cit> . we compared the ability of our system to deliver a chlr transgene into a pair of strains, one with tn <dig> already in the attachment site  and one without tn <dig> . selecting for the chlr transgene, we found that the frequency of insertion  was nearly  <dig> fold lower in the strain with a blocked attachment site . thus insertion at secondary sites can occur but the frequency is so much lower that it is extremely unlikely to recover a secondary non-site-specific insertion .

CONCLUSIONS
this system for creating chromosomal transgenes is fast, easy and efficient. transposition occurs in 79% of cells treated , and occurs very specifically into the tn <dig> attachment site. this is the highest tn <dig> transposition seen in any in vivo system  <cit> , with frequencies of closer to 1% being more typical. in our system, transposition occurs at such high frequencies that selection for transgene insertion is not required. this is not the first system to employ tn <dig> for transgene integration. however, previously described systems utilize multiple plasmids and are not efficient enough to allow detection of insertion events in the absence of a selection  <cit> . non-specific transposition occurs at a frequency of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> in our system , indicating that there is little worry of non-specific or secondary transposition events. we have demonstrated the utility of this system in ten members of the e. coli reference collection of environmental isolates   <cit>  and others have successfully inserted transgenes into enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic e. coli isolates . we have also demonstrated the utility of this system in another enterobacterial species, salmonella typhimurium  indicating the broad utility of our approach. our transgene integration method can be used in any bacterium that supports replication of the psc <dig> origin .

this transgene integration system accommodates large transgenes, as we have seen similar frequencies of insertion with inserts as large as  <dig>  kb . others have used pgrg <dig> to insert the  <dig>  kb luxcdabe operon into extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli and observed similar insertion frequencies . it is likely to be possible to insert even larger transgenes, as wildtype tn <dig> carries  <dig> kb between the left and right ends.

because the tn <dig> attachment site is highly conserved amongst diverse bacterial species  <cit>  this system may be useful in many different bacteria. possible limitations of the system with regard to whether it will work in other organisms are: 1) the ability to deliver dna via transformation or conjugation, 2) the ability of the plasmid to be replicated sufficiently to support transposase expression, and 3) the activity of the arabad promoter driving transposase expression. restriction of foreign dna can have a dramatic negative effect on transformation efficiency, however in cases where restriction may be a problem, for example, with environmental isolates, the ocr type  <dig> restriction inhibitor  <cit>   can greatly improve transformation efficiency. systems utilizing broad host range plasmids have been described that use tn <dig> transposition functions to insert transgenes into the chromosome  in numerous different bacteria. although these other systems work in diverse bacteria and are very useful tools for that reason, they have more components and are several orders of magnitude less efficient requiring drugr markers to detect transgene insertions. the drugr marker can be removed after insertion with additional steps, but clearly the system we describe here for single-step insertion without selection is simpler and easier in the organisms where we have demonstrated functionality .

expanding the utility of our system to include bacteria outside the enterobacteriaceae might be possible by incorporating a broad host range replicon combined with a negative selection for loss of the plasmid. indeed, tn <dig> seems the ideal molecular machine for delivering transgenes given that the atttn <dig> sequence appears to be present in most genomes examined . tn <dig> has been demonstrated to move in a broad variety of gram negative bacteria  <cit>  and the presence of tn7-like sequences in bacillus cereus and clostridium thermocellum suggests that it would transpose in gram positives as well .

a commonly used method for transgene insertion available prior to this work  <cit>  is based on phage λ red recombination. it usually requires pcr amplification of the substrate, transformation of the red gam expression system and transformation of the recombination substrate, followed by curing and pcr verification. removal of the necessary drugr marker requires an additional transformation and curing. it works at frequencies at or below 10- <dig>  meaning that a selection is required. the tn7-based method described here inserts genes at such high frequencies that selection is not required. it requires very few steps: cloning the transgene, transformation into the strain of interest and growth at  <dig> temperatures, followed by pcr verification of insertion. clearly our system is an improved method with fewer steps and greatly improved efficiency.

we anticipate this system to be useful for studies requiring single-copy gene expression, for example genetic studies, including complementation experiments. in addition, we envision that this system will be useful for development of bacterial strains for environmental release , including live-vector vaccine strains  <cit> . expression of heterologous antigens in vaccine strains is currently largely plasmid-based, one reason being that plasmid copy number facilitates expression of sufficient antigen to engender an immune response. however, recent work has demonstrated that immunologically relevant levels of antigen can be expressed from the chromosome  <cit> . the construction of stable and selection-free chromosomal transgenes using this tn7-based system should support the development of chromosomal antigen expression technology. it is worth noting that because tn <dig> recognizes an atttn <dig> site in the human genome  <cit>  it may be possible to create vectors for use in human cells to deliver genes at high-frequency into an innocuous site in the human genome for gene therapy.
