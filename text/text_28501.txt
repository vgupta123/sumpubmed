BACKGROUND
gene trapping has proved to be an effective strategy for functional genomics and gene discovery in both animals and plants  <cit> . gene trap constructs are designed to detect the expression of a chromosomal gene upon insertion into its transcribed region. consequently, the inserted gene trap reports the gene expression pattern and a visible mutant phenotype is not required for gene identification. the direct visual assessment of reporter gene expression enables the identification of functionally redundant genes, genes that operate in multiple developmental stages and genes whose functions in later development are obscured by an early lethal phenotype, all of them not easily amenable to classic genetic analysis. several types of "trapping" systems, differing in the reporter gene constructs used, have been developed: enhancer trap, gene trap and promoter trap  <cit> . the gene traps are characterized by splice acceptor sites and sometimes an intron upstream of the reporter gene coding region. these structural features facilitate the production of in-frame reporter protein fusions regardless of insertion into intron or exon sequences.

due to extensive knowledge about their transposition features, activator  and dissociation  transposable elements from maize have been successfully utilized for insertional mutagenesis in heterologous plants  <cit> . with the aim to discover genes whose knockout does not display a visible mutant phenotype, ac/ds based gene trap systems were introduced in arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . furthermore, different gene trap systems based on t-dna transfer in arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit>  and on recombination in physcomitrella patens  <cit>  have proven their usefulness for the study of developmental processes and gene discovery in plants.

in addition to its agricultural importance, barley evolved as a model species for the triticeae  <cit> . due to gene synteny and colinearity among the triticeae genomes  <cit>  the diploid barley is considered a reference species especially for polyploid triticeae members like wheat. similar to maize and wheat the  <dig> mb barley genome  <cit>  is partitioned into gene-rich regions and large stretches of gene-poor repetitive dna composed of numerous retrotransposons  <cit> . for barley many genomics resources exist, including more than  <dig> well-characterized genetic linkage maps, a large-insert bacterial artificial chromosome  library and a barley microarray  <cit> . at present, more than  <dig>  <dig> expressed sequence tags  are available  <cit>  that cover a significant portion of the barley gene repertoire. the establishment of transformation systems  <cit>  and the successful introduction of ac/ds elements  <cit>  were the initial steps towards gene tagging approaches in barley  <cit> .

up to now, gene trap and enhancer trap approaches in monocots have exclusively been reported in rice  <cit> . in this study, we report the introduction of an ac/ds-based gene trap system in barley, thus expanding the number of genomics tools available to the barley research community. a gene trap construct  <cit>  designed to provide an increased gene trapping efficiency, particularly in monocotyledonous plants, was used to produce barley gene trap lines. the frequent transposition of the gene trap construct and efficient expression of the reporter gene in these lines demonstrate that this approach is a significant step towards large-scale gene trapping in this crop.

RESULTS
generation of gene trap lines
the maize transposable element ac/ds was chosen to construct a two-component gene trap system for barley. two versions of ac expressing either wild type transposase  or an n-terminally truncated transposase  under control of the native ac promoter were used . both tpase-expressing elements were immobilized by removal of the five terminal bases from the 5' terminal inverted repeat  sufficient to abolish ac transposition  <cit> . the non-autonomous ds element named gtdsb carries the uida reporter gene encoding β-glucuronidase   <cit> . the reporter gene is preceded by engineered intron and triple splice acceptor sequences upstream of the atg codon . each of the three constructs was stably transformed into barley cultivar golden promise by particle bombardment. to verify the integration of intact copies and estimate the transgene copy number, in order to select parental lines for crosses, we subjected independent lines, seven carrying ac and  <dig> harbouring gtdsb, to dna gel blot analysis. eleven gtdsb lines with low , medium  and high  copy number and four tpase lines were selected as starter lines . two tpase lines express wild type tpase and two the truncated tpase103– <dig> protein. the number of integrated ac tpase copies was between one and four in the different lines. the expression of a functional tpase was confirmed with plants from all four tpase lines  using a transient assay for tpase activity  <cit> . from crosses of the four tpase lines with each of the  <dig> gtdsb lines we obtained f <dig> progeny for  <dig> different combinations.

analysis of gtdsb transposition
dna gel blot analysis was employed to study the transposition of gtdsb in the gene trap lines. in these experiments the occurrence of a new gtdsb-hybridizing dna fragment in comparison to the corresponding gtdsb parental line was chosen as a criterion to indicate transposition of gtdsb. we performed analysis of gtdsb excision and reinsertion events in  <dig> f <dig> plants originating from  <dig> independent crosses. nine plants  derived from six independent crosses showed novel hybridizing bands that were not present in the parental gtdsb lines .

for a second set of experiments we rescued progeny harbouring both tpase and gtdsb constructs from  <dig> selfed f <dig> plants , each derived from an independent cross of different parental lines. a total of  <dig> f <dig> plants, including an average of five siblings per independent cross, with the exception of lines gt <dig> and gt <dig> with one and  <dig> plants each, were analyzed. new gtdsb-hybridizing bands were detected in  <dig> f <dig> plants  representing  <dig> of the  <dig> f <dig> gene trap lines . examples of dna hybridization patterns are shown in figure  <dig>  unique hybridization patterns, suggesting independent transposition events, were found in  <dig> f <dig> plants . independent transposition events can be due to either transposition in independent cells of the f <dig> plant, which subsequently were transmitted to progeny, or to somatic transposition in the f <dig> seedling . in contrast, early transposition of gtdsb in the f <dig> generation may result in all progeny inheriting the same insertion . additionally a transposition event having occurred in one of the barley tillers during the development of the f <dig> plant may lead to several but not all f <dig> siblings showing the same new gtdsb insertion . transposition of gtdsb occurred in progeny of crosses with each of the  <dig> gtdsb parental lines , evidencing that every independent parental gtdsb line carries transposition competent constructs.

the gene trap f <dig> population was also screened for visible phenotypic abnormalities. in  <dig> of the  <dig>  gene trap f <dig> plants deviations from barley wild type phenotype were observed . these included reduced fertility , aberrant leaf pigmentation  and stunted growth  . interestingly, in two plants, gt29/ <dig> and gt39/ <dig>  showing asymmetric internodes leading to bending stems and stunted growth with shortened ears respectively, the phenotypic deviation coincided with an independent transposition event. a possible connection between the transposition event and the conspicuous phenotype must be examined in further experiments.

to prove the persistence of gtdsb transpositional activity in later generations, we subjected a total of  <dig> f <dig> plants originating from the f <dig> plants gt54/ <dig>  gt29/ <dig>  gt49/ <dig> and gt41/ <dig> to dna gel blot analysis. in five of the  <dig> gt54/ <dig> progeny ,  <dig> of the  <dig> gt29/ <dig> progeny ,  <dig> of the  <dig> gt49/ <dig> progeny  and three of the  <dig> gt41/ <dig> progeny  new gtdsb-hybridizing dna fragments were detected. these transposition events must have occurred either in the f <dig> and f <dig> generation or in somatic tissue of the f <dig> plants.

sequence analysis of gtdsb flanking regions
we employed tail-pcr  <cit>  to obtain dna sequences flanking transposed gtdsb constructs from gene trap f <dig> plants. in total,  <dig> genomic sequences ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp were isolated and compared to publicly available databases using blast searches. we considered expectation  values below 1e- <dig> to assign a putative identity to a flanking sequence. as evidenced by similarity to expressed sequence tags  from members of the triticeae and maize,  <dig> of the  <dig> gtdsb insertions  are located in transcribed genomic regions . moreover,  <dig> gtdsb flanking sequences  show high identity to ests from barley . assuming an average sequence length of about  <dig> bp, the  <dig>  <dig> non-overlapping barley ests in the databases  <cit>  represent approximately  <dig> mb of total sequence, or about 3% of the  <dig> mb barley genome  <cit> . consequently, a random fragment of barley dna would have on average a 3% chance of being homologous to a barley est in the database. considering that more than 80% of the barley genomic sequences are intergenic heterochromatin  <cit>  and therefore not expressed, the frequent identity of the flanking genomic sequences to barley ests clearly indicates a preference for gtdsb insertion into coding regions.

expression of the gus reporter
the expression of the gus reporter gene was assayed by histochemical gus staining in  <dig> f <dig> plants, comprising  <dig> to  <dig> progeny of the  <dig> individual f <dig> gene trap lines . staining for gus expression was performed in leaves, nodes, immature florets, pollinated florets, immature grains and seedlings covering several stages of barley development. the leaves, nodes and immature florets were collected from developmental stage  <dig> defined following the zadoks code system for growth staging in barley  <cit> . pollinated florets, immature grains and seedlings represent developmental stages 65– <dig>  83– <dig> and  <dig> respectively. for the majority of the  <dig> f <dig> plants multiple explants were examined , resulting in a total of  <dig> analysed explants. this experimental approach was chosen to enable the distinction of somatic from heritable events. we assume that, if only one explant of a certain organ type shows gus expression, it may be considered as a somatic event. in contrast, if the majority or all explants of the same organ type from a single plant exhibit an equal gus expression pattern, the event may be transmitted to progeny. due to the two-element approach, these inheritable events can be stabilized by segregation of the tpase construct and are amenable to further analysis.

expression of the gus reporter could be detected in 51%  of the analysed f <dig> plants . moreover, gus expression was found in  <dig> of the  <dig> f <dig> lines and in progeny of all gtdsb parental lines used. examples of gus expression in various organs are shown in figure  <dig>  in immature florets and in pollinated florets gus activity was primarily detected in the palea and lemma . in addition, in three cases gus activity appeared in the stigma and pistil . in all samples the gus signals in culm nodes corresponded to the example shown in figure 3d. the seedlings displayed gus expression primarily in the scutellum . in five cases gus activity could be observed in the roots . in the majority of gus positive seeds the expression was localized in the endosperm . however, in three cases gus signals were observed in the pericarp .

out of the  <dig> gus positive plants  <dig> showed gus expression restricted to one or two explants, even when occurring in several organs, indicating that the majority of the events is due to somatic transposition of gtdsb. in such cases only a limited portion of somatic tissue carries the new gtdsb insertion and can consequently be expected to express gus. in contrast, in  <dig> f <dig> plants gus expression was detected in the same tissue in at least 50% of the explants  denoting candidates for heritable events. in eight of these candidates gus expression was detected in scutellar tissue of seedlings  or in the endosperm of immature grains . analysis of progeny will confirm the heritability of these gene trap events enabling identification of gtdsb integration sites.

the gus staining frequency ranged between 3% and 26% in individual organs . as expected, the highest frequencies of 26% and 24% were observed in grains and seedlings representing mostly tissues of the f <dig> generation. as a consequence of transposition in f <dig> tissues early events of the f <dig> generation can be detected in addition to events that occurred in the preceding generations.

analysis of spliced gus transcripts
the expression of gus depends on the transcriptional fusion between the reporter open reading frame and upstream gene sequences following the insertion of gtdsb into a transcription unit. consequently, correct and efficient splicing of the gene trap construct by the host spliceosome is crucial and has been already shown for gtdsb in transient experiments  <cit> . we aimed to demonstrate that splicing of stably integrated gtdsb constructs in the gene trap barley lines is accomplished just as accurately. for these experiments the gene trap line gt <dig> was chosen, since the same gus expression pattern  was found in 100% of the pollinated florets in all progeny tested, indicating an inheritable gene trap event . additionally, rna gel blot analysis confirmed the occurrence of uida-specific transcripts exceeding the size of the original uida transcript by  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, thus indicating the presence of transcriptional fusions encoding gus in the florets of gene trap line gt <dig> . we used 5'-race , to isolate spliced transcripts encoding gus. out of  <dig> isolated 5' sequences, in  <dig> the splice site a <dig> and in three a <dig> has been properly used to generate the reporter gene transcript. these findings are consistent with previous studies of gtdsb splice products in transiently transformed barley tissue, revealing that the splice acceptor sites a <dig> and a <dig> were utilized with almost equal frequencies but eleven times less frequent than a <dig>  <cit> .

discussion
with the development of an ac/ds based gene trap system in barley we contribute a novel functional genomics tool for this species. in our approach gene trapping efficiency depends on transposition of the gtdsb construct. dna gel blot analyses indicate frequent transposition of the gtdsb element in the gene trap lines. the transposition frequency of 11%  detected in the f <dig> generation is in the range of the transposition frequency presented for the barley activation tagging system  <cit> , but higher than that reported for transposition of ds elements  and autonomous ac elements  in f <dig> and t <dig> generations of barley  <cit> . in the f <dig> generation we observed in 26%  of the plants unique newly transposed gtdsb elements, indicating a transposition frequency sufficient for large-scale mutagenesis screens in barley  <cit> . in addition, the rapid recovery of many independent gtdsb insertions will be potentiated by independent transposition events in the tillers of a single barley plant.

in rice and arabidopsis extensive collections of insertion lines have been generated by high throughput t-dna transformation. however, for large-genome and transformation-recalcitrant species like barley insertion mutagenesis strategies based on transposable elements are likely to be advantageous. a recent detailed study of t-dna insertion distribution in rice revealed a preference for insertion into genic sequences, thus reducing the number of insertions needed to saturate the genome  <cit> . the barley genome supposedly contains the same number of genes like rice, but is due to amplification of gene-poor regions about  <dig> times larger  <cit> . therefore, insertion mutagenesis merely based on t-dna transformation would require far more than  <dig>  <dig> primary transformants. for barley these will be difficult to obtain given that barley transformation requires extensive tissue culture periods and is still laborious and relatively inefficient. by contrast, the transposon based approach enables with only a few initial starter lines the successive accumulation of novel independent insertions in a definite plant population  <cit> . in addition, a direct comparison of ac and t-dna insertions in aspen revealed for the transposable element a two fold higher frequency of landing into coding regions  <cit> . the preferential insertion into expressed genomic sequences is a feature of ac/ds transposition, that has been well documented in barley  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . this preference we also observed in the barley gene trap lines evident in the frequent identity of transposed gtdsb flanking genomic sequences to barley ests.

by using  <dig> independent gtdsb starter lines with a variable gtdsb copy number we generated a barley gene trap population comprising more than  <dig> putative gtdsb launch pads at different genomic positions. the transposition of gtdsb could be detected in progeny of crosses with each of the  <dig> gtdsb parental lines, demonstrating that every independent gtdsb line carries transposition competent constructs and can be utilized for gene trapping in barley. although, currently no mapping populations are available for the barley variety used here, a sequence based strategy for assigning ds insertions in golden promise to linkage map coordinates on the existing oregon wolfe barley map has been reported  <cit> . most agronomically important traits, such as yield and quality parameters, are controlled by many genes arranged as so called "quantitative trait loci"   <cit> . gtdsb insertions nearby known qtls will therefore provide useful launch pads for local saturation mutagenesis  <cit> . this approach will take advantage of the well documented ac/ds feature of preferential transposition to chromosomally linked positions  <cit> , equally observed in barley  <cit> .

interestingly, the transposition frequency in the f <dig> generation ranges between 5%  and 67% , if calculated per independent gtdsb parental line. the variance of transposition frequency has been frequently observed in independent barley and rice transgenic lines  <cit>  and likewise in dicots  <cit> . earlier studies have shown that ds transposition is influenced by the genomic position of the element  <cit> . our findings confirm that the transposition frequency is rather influenced by the gtdsb integration site than by the number of gtdsb loci. for example, unique transpositional activity of 67% and 50% was detected in gene trap lines originating from gtdsb parental lines  <dig> and  <dig> having  <dig> and 1– <dig> loci respectively. the dna gel blot results indicate some correlation between gtdsb transpositional activity and tpase-expressing construct. f <dig> plants carrying one  or four  tpase103– <dig> copies exhibit a noticeable higher transpositional activity of 26%  and 27%  than f <dig> plants having two copies of wild type tpase . this finding is consistent with earlier reports, showing that the tpase103– <dig> induces higher excision frequencies of ds than wild type tpase in petunia protoplasts  <cit>  and transgenic tobacco  <cit> .

accurate and efficient splicing of the gene trap construct is a prerequisite for reporter gene expression and therefore crucial for gene trapping efficiency. gtdsb was optimized for efficient splicing in monocotyledonous plants by adapting the splice acceptor sites to the monocot consensus and the introduction of synthetic branch point and t-tract sequences  <cit> . an important feature in the optimization process was to attenuate the first splice acceptor site , since for splice acceptor site selection a scanning mechanism is postulated  <cit> . the isolated 5' sequences of gus fusion transcripts indicate a preference for usage of the first splice acceptor site a <dig> according to former findings  <cit> . however, the isolation of three a2-spliced gus transcripts out of  <dig> analyzed indicates a decrease in a <dig> selection compared to the earlier transient studies  <cit> . with enhanced usage of a <dig> the chance of receiving functional gus at a single integration site is increased by one third compared to exclusive usage of a <dig> emphasizing the potential of gtdsb for gene trapping.

we were primarily interested in detecting reporter gene expression in the gene trap population and, opposite to other transposon-based gene trap approaches  <cit> , did not select for plants with transposed gtdsb constructs prior to the analysis of gus activity. we therefore expected  the gus expression frequency to be lower than the frequencies of 26% and 16% reported in arabidopsis and rice respectively  <cit>  and  to detect a high proportion of somatic events. to raise the probability of gus detection, we decided to screen several organs containing differentiating and dividing cells. additionally, for the majority of the organs multiple explants per single plant were tested for gus activity, thus enabling to discriminate between somatic and transmissible events. this screening mode accounts for the high number of gene trap insertion events detected, since gus expression was found in  <dig> of the  <dig> f <dig> plants . gus expression was detected in progeny of all  <dig> gtdsb lines, which is not surprising as transposition of gtdsb was likewise found in progeny of crosses with all gtdsb parental lines. in  <dig> plants  gus expression was detected in at least half of the explants of a single organ type, primarily in seedlings and florets, suggesting candidates for transmissible events and thus for gene identification. in a rice insertional mutagenesis approach employing a ds based gene trap, gus expression was observed in  <dig> % of the lines analyzed  <cit> . however, the heritability of the events was not addressed. the higher gus expression frequency of 26% in grains and 24% in seedlings in comparison to the remaining organs indicates the accumulation of insertion events in later generations and demonstrates the dependence of gus expression on gtdsb transposition. in f <dig> tissues, in addition to events of the preceding generations, developmentally early transposition events can lead to detectable gus expression. by contrast, in a t-dna based gene trap system in rice homogeneous gus expression frequencies in leaves, roots, florets and immature grains were detected  <cit> .

a particular challenge for plant functional genomics is the abundance of functional gene redundancy and multigene families  <cit> . about 15% of the identified genes in sequenced plant genomes are considered to be members of tandem-arrayed gene families  <cit> . therefore in arabidopsis less than 2% of gene knockouts are expected to display significant mutant phenotypes  <cit> . the gene trap approach may prove to be highly beneficial as indicated by the  <dig> to  <dig> times more frequent detection of gus reporter gene expression compared to visible mutant phenotypes in ac/ds-mediated arabidopsis gene trap lines  <cit> . the identification of genes whose recovery by loss-of-function mutagenesis would have been impeded either by gene redundancy or a lethal phenotype  <cit>  further emphasizes that gene trap insertional mutagenesis provides a powerful genomics strategy.

CONCLUSIONS
barley has one of the largest genomes of all economically important cereal crops and even though more and more genomic sequence data are available various functional genomics resources will be needed to address questions of yield and stress resistance. with the ac/ds-mediated gene trap system in barley we adopt a novel functional genomics tool for this species. this will be valuable for both gene trapping and knockout mutation as well as forward and reverse genetic screens. in the gene trap lines we observed frequent transposition of the gene trap construct gtdsb from multiple launch sites sufficient for large-scale mutagenesis. the recovery of individual insertion events will be further assisted by the high number of independent insertions and the preferential transposition into expressed genomic sequences. maintenance of transposition activity over several generations makes the gene trap lines applicable for the accumulation of independent insertions in a barley gene trap plant population. the frequent detection of gus reporter gene expression in the gene trap lines and the proper splicing of our optimized gene trap construct finally prove gene trap insertional mutagenesis to be now attainable for barley functional genomics.
