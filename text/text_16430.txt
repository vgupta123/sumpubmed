BACKGROUND
streptococcus pyogenes or group a streptococcus  is a human bacterial pathogen that colonizes the throat or skin surfaces of the host. gas infection can lead to a number of diseases including pharyngitis, impetigo and necrotising fasciitis. in a small percentage of individuals that are left untreated or are treated ineffectively with antibiotics, streptococcal infections can lead to more serious illnesses such as rheumatic fever  and rheumatic heart disease  which are a significant health concern in developing countries  <cit> .

most gas vaccine strategies have focused on the m protein, a major virulence factor of gas. the m protein has an alpha helical coiled-coil structure comprised of a variable amino terminal domain followed by a set of three repeat regions called a, b and c-repeats, a cell wall anchor motif and a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids which are embedded in the cell membrane. antibodies to the highly variable amino terminal region of the m protein have been shown to be opsonic and protective in murine models and correlate with protection in humans  <cit> . however, there are more than  <dig> recognized emm genotypes  <cit>  and an increasing number of non-m typeable strains  <cit> . therefore, type-specific antibodies are ineffective in providing broad-spectrum protection against multiple different gas strains. strategies employed to develop a broad strain coverage gas vaccine have included the design of multivalent constructs containing type-specific m protein sequences  <cit>  associated with a particular disease or geographical region and the identification of vaccine candidates based on the conserved c-region of the m protein  <cit> .

many studies have investigated the potential of the m protein c-repeat region that is conserved among different gas strains as a vaccine candidate  <cit> . using a series of  <dig> overlapping peptides spanning the entire m protein c-region, a peptide lrrdldasreakkqvekale  that is recognized by antibodies in the sera of most adults living in areas of high gas exposure was identified  <cit> . the acquisition of these antibodies with age paralleled the acquisition of gas immunity indicating the potential use of p <dig> as a vaccine candidate. human sera with antibodies to p <dig> have also been shown to be opsonic against heterologus gas strains. similarly, mice immunized with p <dig> elicited antibodies that were opsonic against gas  <cit> . however, several studies indicated that p <dig> contained a t cell epitope shared with determinants on human cardiac myosin, and keratin in mouse  <cit> . in another study  <cit> , j <dig> , a peptide with minimal b and t cell epitopes within p <dig> was identified as a gas m protein c-region peptide devoid of potentially deleterious t cell autoepitopes, but which contained an opsonic b cell epitope. j <dig> offers the possibility of a vaccine which will elicit protective opsonic antibodies against multiple different gas strains. j <dig> is a chimeric peptide that contains  <dig> amino acids from m protein c-region  and is flanked by yeast-derived gcn <dig> sequences which was necessary to maintain the correct helical folding and conformational structure of the peptide.

from genbank database search and many studies  <cit> , there are about 60% of gas that contain j <dig> sequences, while the remaining contain j14-like sequences. although j <dig> has the potential to be a vaccine candidate to prevent streptococcal infection, there are still one-third of m types that do not contain the j <dig> sequence but contain j14-like sequences. this study utilised three peptides, kqaedkvkasreakkkveadlaqledrvk , kqaedkvkasreakkqvekdlaqaedkvk  and kqaedkvkasraakkeleaehqqaedkvk , representing commonly occurring j14-like sequences, in addition to j <dig>  and assessed their ability to elicit broadly opsonic antibodies following immunization of mice, and potential as vaccine candidates. it is likely that a vaccine incorporating j <dig> and j14-like sequences would be more beneficial in providing protection against streptococcal infections covering the majority of gas m types.

RESULTS
we searched for j <dig> and j14-like sequences and the number of their repeats in the c-terminal region of the m protein from gas strains isolated from the northern thai population. then, we examined the bactericidal activity of j <dig>  j <dig> , j14-r <dig> and j14-r <dig> antisera against multiple thai gas strains. this data is important to the development of an appropriate vaccine against gas infection in a specific endemic population.

distribution of j <dig> and j14-like sequences
twenty different emm types of gas isolated from chiangmai, thailand were included in this study. emm types were analyzed by sequencing the n-terminal region of emm genes. the c-repeat region of emm genes of these isolates were sequenced to examine the distribution of j <dig> and j14-like sequences. the majority of the isolates 12/ <dig>  contained three c-repeats. seven of  <dig> isolates  contained two c-repeats. only one isolate , st <dig>  contained a single c-repeat .

we found  <dig> different j14-types which were j <dig>  j <dig> , j14-r <dig> to j14-r <dig>  the most diversity of j14-types was found in the c1-repeat which contained  <dig> different j14-types . the c2-repeat contained  <dig> different j14-types with the majority being j <dig>  . in addition, j <dig>  is also the major sequence within the c3-repeat. j <dig> was only found in the c3-repeat.

although j <dig> has the potential to be a vaccine candidate to prevent streptococcal infection, only  <dig> of  <dig>  gas isolates in our study contained the j <dig> sequence in the c-repeat region. interestingly, the j <dig>  sequence was found with a higher rate,  <dig> of  <dig> , than j <dig>  in addition, we found that j14-r <dig> and j14-r <dig> are common among the remaining j14-types. therefore, the four "j14" peptides; j <dig>  j <dig> , j14-r <dig> and j14-r <dig>  are promising gas vaccine candidates.

bactericidal activity of gas isolates
we have examined the bactericidal activity  of j <dig>  j <dig> , j14-r <dig> and j14-r <dig> antisera against gas isolates from chiang mai, thailand.

strong bactericidal activity  was found against 75% , 80% , 65%  and 75%  of gas isolates when tested with j <dig>  j <dig> , j14-r <dig> and j14-r <dig> antisera, respectively . medium bactericidal activity  was found against 25% , 15% , and 10%  of gas isolates when tested with j <dig>  j14-r <dig> and j14-r <dig> antisera, respectively . low bactericidal activity  was found against 20% , 20% , and 15%  of gas isolates when tested with j <dig> , j14-r <dig> and j14-r <dig> antisera, respectively .

we also compared bactericidal activity of peptide antisera against gas containing different numbers of c-repeats. the mean percent reduction in cfu of isolates with a single c-repeat was significantly lower than isolates with two or three c-repeats . this result corresponded to a study of vohra et al  <cit>  which found that the mean percent reduction in cfu of isolates with two c-repeats was statistically lower than strains with three c-repeats.

recently, sandin et al.  <cit>  and mcarthur et al.  <cit>  have commented on the capacity of fibrinogen and albumin to bind to the b- and c-repeats, respectively, causing inhibition of antibody binding under physiological conditions. nevertheless, several studies  <cit>  demonstrated the binding of anti-c-repeat antibody to gas isolates, which are in agreement with our study.

then, we examined the correlation between the opsonization specificity of peptide antisera and j14-types. we found no correlation between the opsonization ability of peptide antisera and j14-types contained in the c-repeats. for example, all j <dig> peptide antisera showed strong bactericidal activity  against isolates  <dig> and  <dig> having only j <dig>  with two c-repeats and isolate  <dig> also having only j <dig>  but with three c-repeats.

these data indicate that these four peptides, j <dig>  j <dig> , j14-r <dig> and j14-r <dig>  have the potential to be used as gas vaccine candidates to prevent streptococcal infections.

for further study towards the development of a broad strain protective gas vaccine, it may be possible to use a strategy designed to assemble all four j <dig> peptides into a single construct  <cit> . this would have several advantages, including inducing a heterologous opsonic immune response and also providing protection against challenge with many different gas strains  <cit> . one such technology is the lipid core peptide  technology  <cit>  which has been used to incorporate up to four different peptides into a single lcp vaccine construct  <cit> . this system also incorporates the carrier and adjuvant into the vaccine and has the potential for the development of self-adjuvanting multi-antigen component vaccines for human application  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrated that antisera raised against the m protein conserved c-repeat region are able to kill multiple different gas strains isolated from the northern thai population. therefore, the four conserved "j14" peptides have the potential to be used as gas vaccine candidates to prevent streptococcal infections in an endemic area.
