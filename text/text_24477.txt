BACKGROUND
it has been argued that gene duplications underlie mechanisms to achieve stress adaptation  <cit> . there is little evidence, however, to support this. additionally, it is not known if there is one or multiple ways of achieving stress adaptation through gene duplication. to address this question, we focused our attention on salt tolerance, and the evolutionary histories of two gene families involved in this trait.

salt tolerance is a complex trait that is thought to have originated multiple times in plants  <cit> , and it is important to understand the nature and molecular evolution of salt tolerance mechanisms throughout the history of land plants. this will be key not only to our understanding of how plants adapt against the disruptive effects of high salt concentrations in the soil, but also to point out directions for possible crop improvement. indeed farmers are increasingly facing loss of crop production due to this abiotic stress, since currently > 20% of the world’s arable land is affected by high salinity  <cit> .

cation/proton exchangers are essential to the normal function of the cell. besides helping regulating internal ph, cell volume, and cytoplasmic ion homeostasis  <cit> , these transporters have also been shown to be involved in vesicular trafficking and protein targeting  <cit> . in plants, na+,k+/h+ antiporters are also associated with salt tolerance  <cit> , and a series of studies have targeted these cation exchangers to improve agronomically important crops  <cit> .

all na+,k+/h+ exchangers belong to a superfamily of monovalent cation/proton antiporters  and are divided in two families, cpa <dig> and cpa <dig>  <cit> . the cpa <dig> family is composed of two main groups, one containing plasma membrane-bound proteins and the other intracellular proteins  <cit> . within these two groups are well-characterized antiporters associated with salt tolerance in plants, the salt overly sensitive  <dig>  and sodium hydrogen exchanger  proteins. sos <dig> proteins are localized in the plasma membrane  <cit> , and are responsible for na+ efflux from the cell. nhx proteins, on the other hand, are intracellular proteins that compartmentalize na+ and k+ in the vacuole  <cit> .

in arabidopsis thaliana, the nhx protein family has six members that are classified into two classes  <cit> . the class i proteins, atnhx1- <dig>  are localized in the tonoplast  <cit>  and have equal affinity for na+ and k+ <cit> . class ii proteins include atnhx <dig> and  <dig>  which are localized in the endosomal compartment of the golgi and trans-golgi network  <cit>  and have a higher affinity for k+ compared to na+ <cit> .

previous reports have shown that the arabidopsis nhx genes which encode these proteins have different expression patterns and responsiveness to abiotic stresses  <cit> . atnhx <dig> and  <dig> were shown to be expressed at high levels in all plant tissues, while atnhx <dig> and  <dig> were mainly expressed in root and flower tissues, respectively  <cit> . atnhx <dig> was also expressed in all tissues but at lower levels  <cit> , while atnhx <dig> expression was detected only in shoots and roots by rt-pcr  <cit> . in addition, while atnhx1- <dig> were shown to be responsive to both salt stress and abscisic acid   <cit> , atnhx <dig> was only responsive to salt stress, suggesting that its response is aba-independent  <cit> . moreover, all nhx genes promoted the recovery of a salt sensitive yeast mutant  <cit>  and numerous studies have shown that overexpression of arabidopsis nhx <dig> and  <dig>  or rice nhx <dig> , resulted in increased salt tolerance in transgenic plants  <cit> .

the other protein that characterizes this cation/proton exchanger family is sos <dig>  which belongs to the well-known salt tolerance salt-overly-sensitive  pathway  <cit> . salt stress elicits a cytosolic calcium signal, which functions as a major secondary-messenger signalling molecule. a myristoylated calcineurin b-like protein  senses the salt-elicited calcium signal, and upon ca2+ binding sos <dig> undergoes dimerization and enhances the serine/threonine protein kinase activity of sos <dig>  the sos3/sos <dig> complex is targeted to the plasma membrane and activates sos <dig>  <cit> .

sos <dig> has been called nhx <dig> by several authors, and was thus thought to be part of the nhx gene family  <cit> . previous studies, however, regarding the phylogeny of cation/hydrogen transporters  <cit>  suggest that it is distinct from the other nhx proteins and should more appropriately retain its designation as sos <dig>  for this reason, we refer to the arabidopsis proteins sos1/nhx <dig> and nhx <dig>  as sos1a and sos1b, respectively. sos1b, like sos1a, is localized to the plasma membrane  <cit> . while sos1a is a na+/h+ antiporter  <cit> , however, sos1b seems to only transport li+ <cit> . in addition, the tonoplast exchangers in arabidopsis are also regulated by the sos pathway, specifically by sos <dig>  <cit> , thus suggesting coordination between tonoplast and plasma membrane antiporters.

the importance of these two families of proteins in plant salt tolerance is well established. by promoting the efflux of na+, sos1a helps protect the cell from the deleterious effects of this ion. additionally, sos1a seems to have an important role in long-distance na+ transport, thus helping to regulate the na+/k+ ratio in roots and shoots  <cit> . on the other hand, nhx family members have been described as essential to na+ compartmentalization in the vacuole, protecting the cell from the deleterious effects of this ion and maintaining cytoplasmic ion homeostasis  <cit> . recent studies, however, suggest instead that increased salt tolerance of nhx over-expressing plants result from an improved ability to retain k+ after stress induction  <cit> .

despite the key roles these genes play in salt tolerance in plants, little is known about the evolutionary histories of both gene families. understanding the evolution of na+,k+/h+ antiporters can help clarify the mechanisms leading to plant stress adaptation associated with gene duplication events  <cit> . in this study, we report a comprehensive molecular evolutionary analysis of both the nhx and sos <dig> plant protein families. we reconstructed the phylogeny and the history of duplication events for each family, as well as determined the selection pressure on amino acid sites within these proteins. our purpose here is not to identify novel nhx and sos <dig> plant genes, or to do a phylogeny analysis of the entire monovalent cpa gene family, as in others  <cit> . instead, we show that the nhx and sos <dig> gene families have very different evolution trajectories and suggest that these divergent evolutionary histories are related to the evolution of their function and cellular localization. finally, we suggest that the nhx and sos <dig> families represent examples of two different paths in the molecular evolution of stress tolerance.

RESULTS
phylogeny of the nhx family exhibits multiple independent duplication events
we selected  <dig> genes in  <dig> taxa that appear, or are described, to belong to the nhx family. the distribution of nhx genes among the various species is shown in table  <dig>  among these genes,  <dig> are found in  <dig> angiosperm species,  <dig> in  <dig> gymnosperm taxa, and  <dig> in  <dig> non-seed plant taxa. we also identified  <dig> sequence from the alga c. reinhardtii, and we used  <dig> sequence from the budding yeast s. cerevisiae as an outgroup. the nhx phylogeny agrees with the classification of these proteins in two distinct evolutionary groups. we obtained two main clades, with ~99% bootstrap support, which showed evolutionary divergence of nhx protein groups according to their protein localization, as previously reported  <cit>  . proteins localized in the endosomal compartment of the golgi and trans-golgi network grouped in clade  <dig> , while proteins localized in the tonoplast grouped in clade  <dig> 

we observe that multiple independent duplication events have occurred throughout the evolutionary history of the nhx family. based on the reconciled phylogeny , we estimate  <dig> independent gene duplication and  <dig> gene loss events during the diversification of this gene family. gene loss events, however, are not displayed on the phylogeny since they might not represent true losses but may be due to partial gene inventories due to incomplete whole genome sequencing data  and to some genes still remaining to be identified. in this reconciled tree, all the branches with bootstrap support inferior to a set value  are rearranged to achieve the most parsimonious duplication and loss history for the gene family. nevertheless our results, together with the fact that non-plant species also have multiple nhx genes  <cit> , suggest that multiple copies of nhx proteins were already present in a common ancestor of modern land plants   <cit> .

interestingly, orthologs of arabidopsis nhx <dig> and  <dig> might be specific to  seed plants. nhx <dig> and  <dig> proteins consistently grouped separately from proteins from basal plant lineages such as spikemoss , moss , and the green photosynthetic alga  . due to the limited number of gymnosperm sequences  we could not assess divergence from the more closely related species to the angiosperms. sequences from more gymnosperm species are available as est sequences in plantgdb database, which coupled with greater availability of genomics resource data from other non-flowering plant taxa species, could potentially be used in the future to examine more closely the precise origins of specific gene family clades. however, our results suggest that nhx proteins grouping with atnhx <dig> and  <dig> might be more recent and specific to seed plants. nevertheless, bootstrap supports obtained for these branches were not very high  and more sequences will be necessary to be analyzed to confirm this.

purifying selection on nhx proteins
we examined the sequences of the plant nhx gene family to determine whether there was significant heterogeneity in selective pressure among amino acid sites. selective pressure at the protein level can be measured as dn/ds, where dn and ds are the number of non or synonymous substitutions per non or synonymous site, respectively  <cit> . if non-synonymous mutations are favored by positive selection, non-synonymous mutations are fixed at a faster rate and dn/ds >  <dig>  <cit> . in the case of purifying selection dn/ds <  <dig>  however, if selection has no effect on fitness due to neutral evolution, both mutations are fixed at the same rate and dn/ds =  <dig>  <cit> .

for nhx coding region sequences from both clade  <dig> and  <dig>  the average dn/ds was estimated at ~ <dig>  and no sites were predicted to be under positive selection. additionally, no difference in dn/ds between nhx genes was identified. we believe that these results might reflect the key function of nhx proteins, which besides salt tolerance  <cit>  include normal cell functions in vesicular trafficking and protein targeting  <cit> . additionally, nhx proteins are predicted to have ~ <dig> transmembrane domains  <cit>  and are probably constrained at the structural level. our results are consistent with the purifying selection expected for these proteins  <cit>  and agree with results recently obtained by hudson et al.  <cit> .

phylogeny of the sos <dig> family exhibits few and recent duplication events
unlike the nhx family, plant species appear to have lower numbers of sos <dig> genes in their genomes. we have selected  <dig> genes in  <dig> taxa that appear, or are described, to belong to the sos <dig> family. the distribution of sos <dig> genes among the various species is shown in table  <dig>  among these genes,  <dig> are found in  <dig> angiosperm species, and  <dig> in  <dig> non-seed plant taxa. in this case we used  <dig> sequences from the moss p. patens as outgroup sequences.

we found that eight plant species, including a. thaliana, seem to have two sos1-like genes . at the time of submission of this manuscript, however, a new blastp search using phytozome v <dig>   suggested that more species might possess more than one putative sos <dig> protein. the existence of two sos <dig> genes has been described previously for arabidopsis thaliana <cit>  and two other plant species not included in this study, namely neptune grass   <cit>  and quinoa   <cit> . nevertheless, to confirm that these seven species have two sos1-like proteins like in arabidopsis, it is necessary to perform further functional studies.

∆ represents the difference in protein length.

as in arabidopsis, the species with two sos1-like proteins usually displayed differences in protein length . however, two classes of length differences were identified - one in which both duplicates had similar lengths , and another in which the difference in duplicates length was substantially larger . nevertheless, as in arabidopsis, the differences in length were mainly due to shortening in the c-terminus instead of deletions within the protein primary sequence. this is important to notice, because it was shown by quintero et al.  <cit>  that it is within the c-terminus of sos1a that lays the activation site and the auto-inhibitory domain of the protein. additionally, sos1-like proteins from a. coerulea, e. grandis, and m. esculenta have deletions in the n-terminus of the protein when compared to the arabidopsis sos <dig> proteins. this suggests that sos1-like proteins from these three species might have a smaller transmembrane region, but further biochemical analyses need to be performed to confirm this.

the sos <dig> phylogeny  exhibits three distinct clades:  one that contains the moss and spikemoss proteins ,  another that has monocot proteins , and  finally, one clade with dicots sos <dig> sequences. the sos <dig> protein phylogeny is almost identical to the accepted species phylogeny of the study species, although there appears to be some long-branch attraction that alters the position within the dicot clade of one eucalyptus grandis and one a. thaliana protein.

unlike the nhx family, the sos <dig> family has undergone fewer gene duplication events. reconciliation of the sos <dig> tree with the species tree  estimates that  <dig> independent gene duplication events and one loss have occurred within the land plants . once again, gene losses may simply represent unidentified genes; in fact oh et al.  <cit>  recently reported that thellungiella parvula has three copies of the a. thaliana sos1b and that these result from recent tandem duplications.

interestingly, gene duplication events in the sos <dig> family appear toward the terminal nodes of the reconciled tree, indicating that these events were recent in evolutionary time. the analyses of some species that have a second copy of sos <dig> further support this observation. for example, populus trichocarpa is thought to have undergone a recent whole genome duplication event  <cit>  and monocots such as brachypodium distachyon are thought to be more prone to tandem duplications which suggests that any gene duplication in one monocot species is probably recent and not shared with the common ancestor of this group  <cit> .

purifying selection on sos <dig> proteins with few amino acids under positive selection
like the nhx proteins, the sos <dig> proteins are generally subject to purifying selection, but our analysis indicates that some amino acid sites appear to be under positive selection. among the land plants the sos <dig> proteins had an average dn/ds of ~ <dig> . using alignments that largely represented orthologous sequences, the glutamine at position  <dig>  in a. thaliana is evolving neutrally  and two amino acid residues are under positive selection  - a valine at position  <dig>  and a serine at position  <dig>  . other residues  were identified in our analysis as strong candidate residues to be under neutral or positive selection, but these were not as well supported as the other three sites. nevertheless, these other residues might be indeed under neutral or positive selection since the tests designed to detect positive selection are very stringent.

in general, structurally constrained sites should be under stronger purifying selection, while unstructured sites have higher levels of amino acid replacements  <cit> . according to different prediction tools available at expasy , however, the positively selected residue v <dig> is in a predicted transmembrane helix. amino acid site q <dig> is predicted to be in a transition zone between coiled and beta-sheet regions, and residue s <dig> is predicted to be in a random coil.

two of these residues, v <dig> and s <dig>  are in the cytoplasmic domain of atsos1a  but do not fall in the auto-inhibitory domain  or near sites known to be relevant for protein activation by phosphorylation   <cit> . additionally, mutations of these three residues under neutral or positive selection are not predicted to result in changes that affect secondary or tertiary structure, or create new sites for putative posttranslational modifications . nevertheless, residue s <dig> is in close proximity to residues s <dig> and v <dig>  which were shown to affect the activity of the a. thaliana protein when mutated  <cit> . like s <dig> and v <dig>  s <dig> is not well conserved between species. mutations within the transmembrane pore were also shown to affect atsos1a activity  <cit> . thus, it may be that the roles of residues s <dig> and v <dig> in the activity of the sos1a protein are worth study.

relaxation of selection on sos <dig> gene duplicates
the sos <dig> family apparently exhibits a relaxation of purifying selective pressure upon duplication, as previously reported in other gene families  <cit>  and, specifically for ion transporters  <cit> . this relaxation of selection, however, seems to be present in only one duplicated gene copy, and only in species that have two sos1-like proteins differing in length. although the free-ratio model  <cit>  is not generally considered to be a good method to predict dn/ds because it has too many free parameters, the comparison between values of dn/ds is suggestive . species which have two putative sos1-like proteins similar in length  showed a difference in dn/ds values less than  <dig> , while species that retain two putative sos1-like proteins with very different length  displayed a difference in dn/ds values always greater than  <dig> . furthermore, in the cases where the two putative sos1-like proteins substantially differed in length, the shortest appeared to be evolving faster than the longer protein from the same species . we also confirmed that these results were not affected by a saturation of nucleotide substitutions on the shorter sequences , except possibly for atsos1b.

more data is needed to verify if this trend is statistically significant. nevertheless, we can speculate that the possible relation between the differences in protein length and dn/ds might be due to the relative recent occurrence of the duplications in sos <dig>  which could indicate that not enough time has elapsed for differentiation between duplicated genes to have occurred   <cit> . another hypothesis to explain the different dn/ds values observed between sos <dig> proteins that differ in length is that the duplication of some sos <dig> genes did not result in functionally equivalent gene copies, and hence functional divergence between copies is immediately observed.

CONCLUSIONS
contrasting evolutionary histories between the nhx and sos <dig> gene families
nhx and sos <dig> plant gene families exhibit markedly different evolutionary histories - while the nhx family expanded and developed functionally specialized members throughout the history of the land plants , the sos <dig> family remained a low copy gene family . it is clear that after gene duplication events, the nhx family members have undergone a series of protein subcellular relocalization and spatial subfunctionalization events. this can be observed by phylogenetically mapping functional and expression information collected from studies on arabidopsis proteins   <cit> . rice  proteins also exhibit functional differentiation, although they are not always functionally equivalent to their arabidopsis homologues. for example, both atnhx <dig> and osnhx <dig>  which are both part of clade  <dig> , have higher affinity to k+ compared to na+ <cit> , although atnhx <dig> appears to be unresponsive to aba  <cit>  while osnhx <dig> responds to this hormone  <cit> .

in contrast, the sos <dig> genes are found only as single- or low-copy genes in most plant species, suggesting either low duplication rates or a higher rate of gene deletion after gene duplication events for these loci. although it is unclear why sos <dig> is constrained to be a single- or low-copy gene family, the few cases where a second sos1-like gene has remained in the genome, it appears to have undergone neofunctionalization. for example, arabidopsis sos1b is only able to transport li+ <cit> , and the c. nodosa sos1b is described as having a different function from cnsos1a  <cit> . moreover, we found a difference in dn/ds between proteins that are diverging in protein length, thus supporting the observed neofunctionalization or possible loss of function of a second copy of sos <dig>  this difference in dn/ds seems to imply that one of the sos <dig> gene copies suffers, more frequently, a non-synonymous mutation resulting in probable loss of function, and more rarely in neofunctionalization.

in our work, we do not detect a relaxation of selective constraint after duplication in the nhx gene family, in agreement with a previous study  <cit> . furthermore, the difference in average dn/ds between nhx  and sos <dig> proteins  supports previous results  <cit>  indicating that in eukaryotes, old duplicated genes evolve slower than singletons, despite an initial relaxation of constraint right after duplication. our hypothesis is that while nhx proteins can be duplicated and subfunctionalized, they must retain their basic function and thus are under stronger purifying selection. in contrast, sos <dig> proteins cannot be as easily subfunctionalized and any duplicate copy seems to be preferentially lost and thus exhibiting more relaxed selective pressures.

additionally, it may be that the evolutionary constraint on sos <dig> proteins arises from fewer possibilities for subfunctionalization, in contrast to cytoplasmatic membrane proteins such as the nhxs. in a simplistic view, this might occur because intracellular membrane proteins can have multiple locations within a cell without detriment to the function it performs, while a plasma membrane protein that is not localized to the plasma membrane would be unable to perform its desired function. moreover, after subcellular relocalization within the cell, it may be easier to vary transporter affinity towards different ions, and intracellular membrane proteins can then be further subfunctionalized according to their specific location within the cell. this is observed for the nhx family in which atnhx1- <dig> have equal affinities towards na+ and k+, while atnhx <dig> and  <dig> have a higher affinity towards k+ .

different means of achieving stress adaptation through nhx and sos <dig> duplications
nhx and sos <dig> plant protein families have two contrasting evolutionary histories that seem to be related to their protein function and location within the cell. it is especially interesting to assess how the evolution of these two gene families, while different, has resulted in plant adaptation to stress conditions. our hypothesis is that the first nhx protein was localized in the endosomal compartment of the golgi and trans-golgi membranes, corroborating a previous suggestion by chanroj et al.  <cit> . the nhx duplications, however, allowed the appearance of other nhx proteins that were targeted to the tonoplast. consequently, an organism with an improved ability to tolerate salt stress arose, since it was able to better retain k+ after stress induction  <cit> .

on the other hand, the duplication followed by neofunctionalization of sos <dig> has generated an increased capacity to tolerate soils with high li+ content in the case of arabidopsis and related species. this is especially relevant for the arabidopsis wild relative, thellungiella spp., that lives in habitats with naturally high li+ concentrations  <cit> ; indeed, thellungiella parvula appears to have three copies of sos1b, probably due to environmental adaptation  <cit> . altogether, our results represent two examples of different molecular evolutionary trajectories in land plant genomes that result in organismal stress adaptation through gene duplication.
