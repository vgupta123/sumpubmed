BACKGROUND
gene transcription regulation is one of the important processes in biology. in eukaryotic cells, effect of highly compartmentalized nucleus on gene transcription regulation has come into notice. by experimental techniques, such as chromosome conformation capture  <cit>   and interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization , the spatial associations between specific genes could be detected  <cit> . they provided accumulating data to study the of 'gene expression in 3d'  <cit> .

mechanisms such as transcription factory <cit>  and nucleus speckles <cit> , know as the "transcriptional interactome" were proposed, and spatial linkage of sequence-distant but function-related genes were revealed in case studies, although there are still debates on mechanisms  <cit> . recently, the only "genome-wide study" was reported to demonstrate transcription interactions  <cit> . however it still focused on a small set of genes  rather than the whole genome. and still as j. lawrence et al. once pointed out, 'a more challenging question for future studies is to determine whether the level of expression is indeed influenced by nuclear and chromosomal organization' <cit> .

recently based on hi-c experiment, a genome-wide picture of chromatin interaction in human gm <dig> and k <dig> cells was reported  <cit> . as being demonstrated, hi-c interactions can be applied as a measurement of spatial distance and chromatin organizations  <cit> . we used hi-c interactions to evaluate whether on genomics level, spatial distances or chromatin structures have potential effect on transcription co-regulation. as the inter chromatin interactions are too small comparing to intra in hi-c interactions  <cit> , we focused only on intra-chromatin gene pairs.

RESULTS
hi-c interaction correlates with co-expression in sequence-distant gene pairs when controlling transcription control similarity
to estimate the effect of chromatin organization, we test the correlation between hi-c interaction  and mutual ranks of gene co-expression rates . we controlled the effect of transcription factors on co-expression using transcription control similarity   <cit> , and used  <dig>  genes with both tf annotation  and co-expression information for analyses. then,  <dig>  intra chromatin gene pairs were extracted by these genes. the hi-c interactions between genes were represented by the interactions between the chromatin units where genes locate on. as gene co-expression rates are calculated among multiple tissues and cell types,  <dig>  gene pairs with similar ranks of hi-c interaction  in the two cell types are finally used for analysis. we coined a term 'normalized distance' to measure the sequence distance between genes .

all pair-wise correlations between hi-c interaction, ranks of gene co-expression, tcs and normalized distance were tested. as expected, the effect of tcs and normalized distance on co-expression could be observed . hi-c interactions strongly correlate with gene co-expression , but potential association of tcs and normalized distance on hi-c interaction exist . it is difficult to explain the direct biological relationship between hi-c interactions and gene co-expression.

it was suggested that intra chromatin sequence-distant genes may be spatially close to each other and activated for expression <cit> . therefore, we focused on these pairs to test whether in common all spatially nearby intra-chromatin genes show co-expression. noting that the correlation between normalized distance and co-expression is weak when normalized distance is bigger than  <dig>  . we chose was this point as the cut-off to select sequence-distant genes pairs for further analyses. for these selected pairs, the correlation between normalized distance and pc is not significant . and also, no significant correlation could be observed between tcs and the hi-c interactions . in such circumstances, there is an obvious trend that genes with more hi-c interactions between them, would more likely to co-express . it implies the potential genome-wide influence of chromatin struture on gene transcription regulation.

in most gene pairs, tcs equal to zero . thus, we further divided them into two groups, equal or not to zero, which may provide us a better control for tcs. correlation analyses were carried out as same as figure.  <dig> and figure.  <dig>  in both groups, co-expressions are correlated with hi-c interactions. .

according to the above results, we show significant correlation between hi-c interactoions and the mutual ranks of gene coexpression. however, the rank values we presented in those figures  are much higher than those that are used to construct gene co-expression networks  <cit> . in coxpresdb, three levels of mutual ranks are used to construct networks   <cit> . we focused on  <dig> co-expressed pairs which get mutual ranks â‰¤ <dig>  and found that they have much more numbers of interaction than other pairs . moreover, for co-expressed genes, there is a similar trend between the mutual ranks of gene co-expression and hi-c interactions .

function-related genes are close to each other and more likely to co-express
we further asked whether intra-chromatin function-related genes are closer to each other as demonstrated by case studies before  <cit> , and what their effects on co-expression are. go term similarity  <cit>  in biological process were used to represent functional relationship between genes. we found significant co-relation between go similarity and hi-c interaction for all the  <dig>  gene pairs . it suggests that function-related genes are close in space, though such correlations are weak in all intra chromatin pairs. the correlation between go similarity and co-expression is nearly the same as between hi-c interaction and co-expression . this suggests that genes with relevant functions, would be more likely close to each other, and such phenomenon would affect transcription regulation.

transcription factory and open/closed chromatin may be the underlying mechanism
why co-localized genes turn to have a similar kind of expression profile? it was suggested that transcription active sites exist in nucleus, such as pol ii-enriched transcription factories  <cit>  and splicing-factor-enriched speckles  <cit> . genes locate on such sites are more actively transcribed, and could move in and out to be transcriptionally active or quiescent  <cit> . such movement may be an important factor in gene transcription regulation  <cit> . in hi-c experiment, formaldehyde is used to cross-link cells, resulting in covalent links between spatially adjacent chromatin segments  <cit> . this procedure is just the same as 3c <cit>  and 4c <cit> , which are used to support the transcription factory mechanism <cit> , and implies the dynamic instinct of gene localization. so our result based on hi-c could be good evidence to illustrate that transcription factories are genome-wide common in human nucleus.

besides the transcription active sites in nucleus, chromatin modification or structure also plays a significant role in gene transcription regulation  <cit> . one of the well-known models for such structure is open and closed chromatin  <cit> . under an assumption that sequence-neighboring genes have a similar chromatin structure, n. batada et al. found that these genes have higher co-expression rates than separate ones  <cit> . they also suggested that the transformation of chromatin structure between open and closed state - chromatin remodelling, is a major source of co-expression of linked genes <cit> . in the hi-c interactions, pc is an indicator of these structure  <cit> . so our results could provide common evidence that open and closed chromatin structures the regulate gene expression without n. batada's assumption <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have provided genome wide evidence of the correlation between hi-c interaction and co-expression of sequence-distant tf-annotated intra-chromatin gene pairs. our results highlight a possible general and independent effect of transcription interactome, on gene transcription regulation, and such effect may be gene-function related. however, it should be noticed that there are still some difficulties to get a definite conclusion. first, lieberman-aiden's study is still the only human hi-c data available on just two cell lines  <cit> . it is hard to distinguish the dynamic and stable chromatin interactions among different cell types. second, the hi-c data has a low resolution, that chromatins are divided into  <dig> m and  <dig> k units, and the average interactions between units are counted. one unit may include many genes. therefore, statistics based upon it, is not prescise. we hope in the future, when more is available, the chromatin-level of gene transcription regulation would be more precisely demonstrated.
