BACKGROUND
microbial pathogens  affect plants and animals of the world dramatically, including their survival, growth, development, and reproduction. in response to pathogen invasion, multicellular organisms have evolved several distinct immune-recognition systems. unlike the adaptive immune system only found in vertebrates, the innate immune system is a universal and evolutionarily ancient mechanism existing in all multicellular organisms  <cit> . the innate immune system nonspecifically recognizes and kills pathogens at the first time and at the first line. the targets of innate immune recognition are called pathogen-associated molecular patterns , produced only by microbes and shared by a class of microorganisms. pamps are highly conserved because such molecular patterns are essential to the integrity, function, or replication of microbes  <cit> . accordingly, pamps are recognized by a variety of host receptors called pattern recognition receptors .

toll-like receptors  are among the best characterized prrs that lie directly at the host-pathogen interface. although tlrs have been regarded for a long time as a classic example of strong evolutionary conservation and intense functional constraint  <cit> , a recent comparison of several drosophila genomes showed for the first time the fast evolution between closely related species  <cit> . although this contradicts the traditional view regarding innate immunity, this finding is congruent with theoretical prediction that over evolutionary time tlrs may be engaged in co-evolutionary arms races with their microbial ligands. some recent discoveries and characterization surveys of tlrs variation in vertebrates  <cit>  provide further corroboration for this prediction. to date, however, very few studies have been conducted on the evolution of tlrs in a limited number of vertebrate species, including primates  <cit> , ungulates  <cit> , birds  <cit> , and bony fishes  <cit> . furthermore, the results from different studies are incongruent with or contradict each other. for example, although ferrer-admetlla et al.  <cit>  regarded balancing selection as the best explanation for sequence variation at human tlrs, mukherjee et al.  <cit>  did not detect any effect of natural selection on tlrs of the indian population and thus supported the traditional viewpoint that purifying selection is the major driving force for the evolution of tlrs. in some inter-specific studies, ortiz et al.  <cit>  detected positive selection at the tlrs of five primate species only, whereas nakajima et al.  <cit>  found the action of positive selection on tlr <dig> when they examined a more extensive phylogenetic sampling. recently, wlasiuk et al.  <cit>  and wlasiuk and nachman  <cit>  detected positive selection on most tlr loci of primates, but intra-specific polymorphisms were found to be influenced mainly by population demography rather than by adaptive evolution. in other words, they found that primate tlrs are characterized by a mode of episodic evolution. positive selection and evolutionary constraint have also been detected in birds  <cit>  and bony fishes  <cit> , suggesting the role of adaptive evolution in response to changes of environmental pathogens. considering the limited number of taxa and loci examined in these studies, a clear picture of the evolution of the tlr gene family has not been painted so far, and more data are necessary to resolve this problem.

cetaceans, including whales, dolphins, and porpoises, are a group of secondarily adapted marine mammals with a history of transition from terrestrial  to full aquatic habitats and subsequent adaptive radiation in waters around the world. although the exact origin and evolutionary history of extant cetaceans remains unclear, a widely accepted view is that the direct terrestrial ancestors of cetaceans  returned to the sea around  <dig> mya <cit> . the ancient cetaceans evolved gradually to conquer nearly all oceans and some rivers of the world  <cit> , and finally diversified into a group of fully aquatic mammals including nearly  <dig> extant species that can be subdivided into two suborders   <cit> . during the transition from land to sea and the radiation and diversification into various aquatic environments, cetaceans must have been confronted with formidable challenges from ever-changing environmental pathogens. for this reason, cetaceans could be one of the most ideal candidate taxa for studying the evolutionary process and the associated driving mechanisms of vertebrate innate immune systems such as tlrs.

here, tlr <dig> was used as an example to reveal the evolutionary history of pattern recognition molecules across cetaceans and their closest terrestrial relatives. tlr <dig> is expressed on the cell membrane and is mainly responsible for the recognition of lipopolysaccharides  from gram-negative bacteria  <cit>  and even components of yeast, trypanosoma, and viruses  <cit> . this molecule interacts with lps indirectly aided with myeloid differentiation factor  <dig>   <cit>  through the formation of a duplex heterodimer  <dig> that is essential to activate a signaling pathway mediating the defense against gram-negative bacteria. it has been reported that some substitutions in the changed amino acid residues of tlr <dig> can alter the interaction among tlr <dig>  md- <dig>  and lps, and modify the tlr4/md- <dig> immunological responses  <cit> . in this study, the open reading frames  of tlr <dig> from representative cetaceans and some closely related artiodactylans were sequenced to elucidate whether this innate immune gene has been the target of positive selection in cetacean evolutionary history. the aims of this study were 1) to find evidence of positive selection at tlr <dig> in cetacean origin and evolution, and 2) to evaluate whether the evolutionary rate of tlr <dig> varied in different cetacean lineages, and if so, what factors could account for this evolutionary pattern. it was interesting to find compelling evidence of positive selection acting on tlr <dig> throughout cetacean evolution, from their origin till the present, and it was speculated that the species-specific effects and/or the complex interaction of multiple factors  might have played a major role in driving the heterogeneity in the evolutionary rate of cetacean tlr <dig> 

RESULTS
in this study, the full sequences containing  <dig> bp of tlr <dig> open reading frame  from  <dig> representative cetaceans and three even-toed ungulates were obtained,  <dig> of which were newly determined and have been deposited in genbank with accession nos. jn642608-jn <dig> . the bayesian analyses and neighbor-joining  method yielded a similar topology , which is basically consistent with a widely accepted hypothesis of whale phylogeny  <cit> . this phylogeny was then used as the working topology in the subsequent analyses. to our knowledge, this is the first study thus far to characterize a tlr locus in cetaceans and to provide some novel insights into the evolution of the innate immune system in the cetacean clade.

positive selection at cetacean tlr4
the site model incorporated in phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood  was used to reveal whether cetacean tlr <dig> was subjected to positive selection. we compared nested models and found that a model including sites with ω >  <dig> fitted the data significantly better than did a neutral model. model m <dig> detected  <dig>  sites under selection with the average ω value of  <dig>  in cetacean . the specific codons identified by the bayes empirical bayes  approach with a posterior probability of 90% constituted an even smaller fraction . with the use of datamonkey,  <dig> and  <dig> codons were detected by fixed effects likelihood  and random effects likelihood , respectively, whereas no site was detected by single likelihood ancestor counting . when all these analyses from paml and datamonkey were combined, nine codons  were picked out as robust sites under positive selection by at least two maximum likelihood  methods, five  of which were predicted by three ml methods. in general, the more radical the amino acid substitutions are, the more likely they will affect function during evolution  <cit> . most of the nine codons identified under selection made relatively conservative changes, while sites  <dig> and  <dig> were involved in radical changes in their physicochemical properties . in particular, codon  <dig> showed the strongest evidence of selection not only because it was detected by three ml methods, but also because it showed radical changes in three independent lineages .

f codons were in the functional regions predicted by the three-dimensional structure in shishido et al.  <dig>  lrr = leucine-rich repeat, ct = c-terminal, tir = cytoplasmic toll/il- <dig> receptor

g amino acid substitutions occurred in the following clades: a = even-toed ungulates, b = river dolphins, c = oceanic dolpins, d = porpoises and white whales, e = sperm whales, f = baleen whales, g = more than one equally parsimonious reconstruction

the amino acid changes reconstructed by parsimony were distributed along 42% of examined cetartiodactylan branches or 46% of examined cetacean branches. thirteen codons  showed parallel amino acid changes , which could be regarded as candidates under selection. these codons were scattered across the entire whale phylogeny , rather than accumulated in just some specific lineages.

the lrt tests based on the branch model suggested that the free-ratio model fitted the data better than did the one-ratio model , indicating that dn/ds ratios were indeed different among lineages. the ω values along three branches were found to be greater than  <dig> with nearly significant statistical support : branch a leading to the last common ancestor of cetaceans and hippos , branch b leading to oceanic dolphins , and branch c leading to the last common ancestor of phocoenidae  + monodontidae   . for all the cetacean lineages examined, ω values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig>  .

when we used the branch-site model to predict positive selection acting on each branch , two lineages were detected under positive selection because likelihood ratio test  tests suggested that model a fitted the data better than did model m1a along branches a   and d   . six and three codons were respectively detected under positive selection along these two branches . the beb values of the positively selected sites along these two branches were not high , which is not surprising, however, as suggested by zhang et al.  <cit> . of these positively selected codons identified using the branch-site model, sites  <dig>  in branch a  and  <dig>  in branch d   showed a stronger signature, with radical amino acid changes in size, polarity, and electric charge , and fell in the functionally important region of tlr <dig> as suggested by shishido et al.  <cit> .

positive selection at different functional domains and 3d structure of cetacean tlr4
the average rate of cetacean tlr <dig> evolution was  <dig>  as inferred with paml m <dig>  where domain-specific ω values are concerned, the transmembrane domain  domain had a higher ω value  than did the other two domains  and  <dig>  for cytoplasmic domain ). however, sliding window analysis  and the above ml methods showed that most codons under positive selection were located within the ext domain, with higher ω values scattered almost all over the leucine-rich repeat  regions of the ext domain, particularly between aa <dig> and aa <dig>  all tests showed that nonsynonymous substitutions were rarely located in the cy and tm domains, and all the sites identified by at least two ml methods  fell in the ext domain. when the amino acids under positive selection were mapped onto the crystallographic structure of tlr <dig>  most of the positively selected sites were found to fall in the regions of interaction with lps  within ext. in addition, site  <dig> identified only by m <dig> was also mapped onto the region binding with lps, which can be regarded as a weak support for the stronger selection on ext .

association of ω values with group sizes
we tested whether the selection on tlr <dig> was correlated with group sizes of cetaceans derived from may-collado et al.  <cit> . the ordinary linear regression analyses did not reveal a significant association between ω values and group sizes for all cetaceans . when delphinids were specially considered, a moderate to high r <dig> value  was obtained but not supported with a statistical significance .

discussion
strong adaptive evolution of tlr <dig> during the habitat shift from land to water
the present study revealed that the branch leading to whale + hippo was under the strongest positive selection at tlr <dig>  evidenced by the highest ω value  and the maximum number of specific codons  detected by branch site model . this lineage was just before the differentiation between cetacean and hippo, both of which are regarded to share a common semi-aquatic ancestor that branched off from other artiodactyls  <cit> . in other words, this lineage represents the habitat transition of the terrestrial ancestors of cetaceans from land to semi-aquatic habitat. it is clear that pathogens were dramatically different in terms of diversity and abundance between land and water. therefore, in such a phase of habitat shift, tlr <dig>  which interacted directly with environmental pathogenic microbes, must have been subjected to strong selective pressures. moreover, a signal of positive selection was also detected in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of cetaceans . this lineage represents the early evolutionary history of cetaceans from semi-aquatic to full aquatic  habitat, during which the cetaceans were faced with the challenges of infectious pathogens in changing habitats. although the ω value of this branch was less than  <dig> , one positively selected codon  was identified, which caused radical amino acid change from a nonpolar gly to a polar asn. that is to say, tlr <dig> must have adaptively modified to recognize and bind potential novel pathogens in the new environment, which is again in accordance with the expectation of the co-evolution arms race model.

adaptive evolution of tlr <dig> associated with rapid diversification of oceanic dolphins
another strong signature of positive selection was detected along the lineage leading to oceanic dolphins, i.e., the family delphinidae . four  adaptive aa changes were found on this lineage with a ω value of  <dig> . in particular, site  <dig> in oceanic dolphins was identified by three ml methods and constituted the most radical change from small, nonpolar, and neutral gly to polar and positively charged his .

the stronger level of positive selection on this lineage might have resulted from the rapid diversification and adaptive radiation that this group has experienced. molecular phylogenetic studies  <cit>  have suggested that a rapid radiation and diversification that occurred near the miocene/pliocene boundary. the delphinid clade has been the most speciose living group of cetacea  <cit>   and the most ecologically versatile, occupying tropical to polar latitudes, coastal and oceanic waters, estuaries, and sometimes freshwater rivers. in response to the dramatic changes in the prevalence, intensity, virulence, and diversity of microbial pathogens in various aquatic environments, innate immune genes such as tlr <dig>  as expected, had to make evolutionarily adaptive changes that were necessary to ensure the long-term survival and successful radiation of dolphins and porpoises in the sea.

domain-specific selective pressure
of the three functional domains of tlr molecules, the ext domain is at the first line of defense against invasive pathogens and plays a key role in directly recognizing and binding pamps such as lps from gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . according to the hypothesis of an arms race between pathogens and vertebrate immune systems, it is reasonable to find a stronger effect of positive selection in the ext domain than in the tm and cy domains. this was corroborated by most codons under positive selection being located within this region and the predominant higher codon-specific ω values being scattered in the lrr region of the ext domain. in particular, most sites under positive selection were found to fall in ext regions interacting with lps , which is similar to that found in primate tlr <dig>  <cit> .

it is somewhat surprising, however, that the overall ω value in the tm region  is much higher than those in the cy  and the ext  domains. actually, this is not a novel finding of this study. a similar phenomenon was reported in primates  <cit>  and ruminant  <cit> , but no explanation was given. nevertheless, it seems irrational to explain this strange higher ω value with a strong signature of positive selection, because only two sites in this region were identified as candidates under positive selection, although with only one ml method . sliding window analysis also verified that most codons with higher ω values >  <dig> were scattered in the ext domain, whereas only very few of such codons were found in the tm and cy domains. given that the tm domain was only  <dig> amino acids in length and only a very small number of candidate selective sites were identified with weak support, it is difficult to obtain an estimate with high statistical significance. the highest ω value in the tm domain, therefore, was most likely a biased estimate or an artifact.

species-specific pattern of positive selection
evolutionary analysis of cetacean tlr <dig> revealed an inconstant pattern of positive selection across the cetacean phylogeny, with different species of extant cetaceans  displaying contrasted selective pressures . what factors triggered or correlated with heterogeneity in the evolutionary rate of cetacean tlr <dig> will be an interesting question to answer. to our knowledge, many life-history traits and species or population-level factors such as mating system, distribution area, habitat type, migration or dispersal pattern, and social structure, are different among cetacean species, and thus might have caused the variation in pathogen pressures and disease risks. to avoid the problem of uncertainty in these factors along the long branches, we focused only on the extant cetacean species . unfortunately, at present, due to insufficient understanding of these factors for different cetacean species, it is not possible for us to address their relationships with heterogeneity in the evolutionary rate of cetacean tlr <dig> using quantitative association analyses. however, some preliminary direct comparisons between life-history traits or population-level factors and selective pressures suggest that a complex species-specific effect might have been an important mechanism to control the heterogeneity in the evolutionary rate of cetacean tlr <dig>  for example, the two river dolphins examined in this study, namely, the ganges river dolphin platanista gangetica and the yangtze river dolphin lipotes vexillifer, both showed similarly lower ω values; however, two positively selective sites were identified in the former while no such site was detected in the latter. in addition, a representative species from the most inshore shallow waters  showed four sites under positive selection, which might imply the negative anthropogenic impacts  in coastal waters on the immune system. however, another species from coastal waters  did not display a similar enhanced selection over other offshore or oceanic species. furthermore, some closely related species showed significantly contrasted levels of selection. for instance, oceanic dolphins within the family delphinidae showed great divergence in evolutionary rates of tlr <dig>  from nearly  <dig>  to  <dig>  . although there is a tendency of group size increasing in delphinoids  <cit> , there seems to be no strong effect on the evolution of tlr <dig>  because no significant association between group sizes and ω values was found not only for all cetaceans but only for delphinids. for this reason, it is necessary to further investigate this issue in the future, with an increasing uncovering of life history and population characteristics of different cetacean species, and a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular evolution of cetacean tlrs as well.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our data presented in this study strongly suggest that tlr <dig> has undergone adaptive evolution against the background of purifying selection across cetacean enigmatic history of transition from land to full aquatic habitats and subsequent adaptive radiation in waters around the world. most sites under positive selection were found to fall in the lrr region of the ext domain interacting with lps, which was accordance with the hypothesis of an arms race between pathogens and vertebrate immune systems. in addition, some preliminary direct comparisons between life-history traits or population-level factors and selective pressures suggest that a complex species-specific effect might have been an important mechanism to trigger the heterogeneity in the evolutionary rate of cetacean tlr <dig>
