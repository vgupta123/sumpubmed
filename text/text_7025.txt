BACKGROUND
glycoside hydrolases , catalyzing the hydrolysis of glycosidic linkages, are widely distributed in the natural world, and play essential roles in the carbohydrate metabolism  <cit> . in the cazy database, ghs are classified into  <dig> families based on sequence similarity   <cit> . among gh families, gh family  <dig> is the largest family and contains various enzymes such as α-amylases , cyclodextrin glucanotransferases , branching enzymes  and α-glucosidases . gh family  <dig> enzymes show low similarity within their amino acid sequences, and are further divided into  <dig> subfamilies  <cit> . they also contain four short conserved regions  including essential amino acid residues for catalysis  <cit> . gh family  <dig> contains several exo-glucosidases: α-glucosidase, oligo- <dig> -glucosidase  and dextran glucosidase . most of these enzymes show high amino acid sequence similarity, and are classified into gh family  <dig> subfamily  <dig>   <cit> .

α-glucosidases are typical exo-type amylolytic hydrolases that release α-glucose from non-reducing ends of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides  <cit>  and commonly associate with other amylolytic enzymes, which completely degrade and utilize starch as a carbon source  <cit> . they are widely distributed among microorganisms, plants and animals, and take part in the glycogen metabolism of higher organisms and nutrient uptake and processing of bacteria  <cit> . α-glucosidases are generally involved in the last step of starch degradation and are the second most important enzymes during the early stages of raw starch hydrolysis  <cit> . in addition to hydrolytic activity, some α-glucosidases possess transglycosylation activity that could be applied to the industrial production of oligosaccharides as well as conjugation of sugars to biologically useful materials . specifically, there is increased interest in applying the transglycosylation activity of α-glucosidases to the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds owing to the specificity, efficiency, and safety of the enzymatic reaction .

numerous α-glucosidases have been characterized, with the majority from mesophilic organisms. industrial application of these enzymes requires stability at high temperatures as well as toward common denaturant agents, and therefore, enzymes isolated from thermophiles have gained attention over the past decade  <cit> . there are many thermostable α-glucosidases from different thermophilic and hyperthermophilic microorganisms such as sulfolobus tokodaii  <cit> , geobacillus toebii  <cit> , thermus caldophilus  <cit> , thermoplasma acidophilum  <cit> , bacillus stearothermophilus  <cit>  and thermus thermophilus  <cit>  have been discovered and characterized, and several mesophilic α-glucosidases have been engineered by mutagenesis to enhance enzyme thermostability  <cit> .

thermus thermophilus is a thermophilic bacterium with optimal growth temperatures of approximately 70–75 °c and produce several enzymes of considerable biotechnological interest, including proteases, phosphatases, catalases, dna processing enzymes, and α-glucosidases  <cit> . α-glucosidases isolated from t. thermophilus hb <dig>  t. thermophilus hb <dig>  and t. caldophilus gk <dig> have been characterised with regard to their substrate specificity  <cit> , which are different from that of the majority of known α-glucosidases. whereas typical enzymes favour the α- <dig>  glycosidic bonds of maltose or maltooligosaccharides  <cit> , thermus α-glucosidases preferentially hydrolyse the α- <dig>  bonds in isomaltose, α- <dig>  bonds in sucrose, or α- <dig>  bonds in trehalose. in addition, they are thermostable and show transglycosylation activity with different substrates.

thermus thermophilus tc <dig>  isolated from a hot spring in yunnan province of china, demonstrates high α-glucosidase activity even at 90 °c . herein, the α-glucosidase  gene from t. thermophilus tc <dig> was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. some properties such as multimerization, effects of metal ions, optimal ph, substrate specificity and transglycosylation of recombinant ttag were different from those of the previously described thermus α-glucosidases, even though they have high sequence identities . we also constructed and screened a random mutagenesis library and obtained one ttag mutant with improved thermostability, which was analysed using site-directed mutagenesis and 3d structure modelling. our findings further the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the thermostability of α-glucosidases and may facilitate the engineering of highly thermostable enzymes for industrial applications.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of ttag
the α-glucosidase gene ttag  cloned from t. thermophilus tc <dig> contains  <dig>  bp and encodes a 528-amino-acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. the deduced protein sequence showed the highest homology to microbial annotated α-glucosidases from t. thermophilus hb <dig> , t. thermophilus hb <dig>  and t. caldophilus gk <dig> , oligo- <dig> -glucosidases from bacillus flavocaldarius , thermus. sp. rl  and meiothermus silvanus dsm  <dig>  with 96 %, 88 %, 87 %, 87 %, 87 %, and 70 % identity, respectively. among these six α-glucosidases, the enzymes from b. flavocaldarius, t. sp. rl, and m. silvanus dsm  <dig> had not yet been reported. the amino acid sequence alignment of ttag with these five enzymes  displayed that ttag contains the four short conserved regions as region i 95-dlvpnh, region ii 193-gfrvdvlwl, region iii 244-emrq, and region iv 321-vlgnhd, indicating that ttag belongs to glycoside hydrolase  family  <dig> of clan gh-h  <cit> .

purification and properties of the recombinant ttag
the ttag gene was successfully expressed in e. coli bl <dig> , and the protein was purified to homogeneity by a two-step process, including heat treatment and his-tag affinity chromatography. the final product showed an approximate  <dig> -fold increase in purity with a recovery of  <dig>  % activity relative to that of the crude enzyme . the specific activity of the purified enzyme was  <dig>  u/mg with pnpg as a substrate. interestingly, the total ttag activity did not decrease; rather, it increased by  <dig>  % after heating at 70 °c for 30 min, when approximately 72 % of the e. coli total proteins were denatured.table  <dig> purification of recombinant ttag



the purified recombinant ttag was homogeneous with an approximate molecular mass of 60 kda in sds-page , which is consistent with the theoretical mass, based on the amino acid sequence. however, gel filtration chromatography showed that the molecular mass of the native ttag was beyond the detection range of 150 kda, indicating that native ttag is an oligomer . to accurately determine the molecular mass of native ttag, we performed dynamic light scattering  analysis, which detected a peak with a hydrodynamic radius of  <dig>  nm , corresponding to a molecular mass of 184 kda, suggesting that native ttag exists in solution as a trimer, whereas the α-glucosidase aglhhb <dig> from t. thermophilus hb <dig> is a dimer  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the gel filtration and dynamic light scattering  of the native recombinant ttag. a the gel filtration of molecular standard marker. b the gel filtration of the native recombinant ttag. c the regularization graph of the native recombinant ttag in dlc experiment. the rayleigh spheres model was used. the x-axis indicates the hydrodynamic radius



a previous study on the catalytic mechanism of α-glucosidase from geobacillus sp. strain hta- <dig> , which shows the highest sequence similarity with ttag in protein data bank  data base and also belongs to gh family  <dig>  identified conserved amino acids d <dig>  e <dig>  and d <dig> as the catalytic residues and h <dig> and h <dig> as the substrate binding sites  <cit> . sequence alignment demonstrated that d <dig>  e <dig>  d <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig> of ttag were highly corresponded and conserved to these sites of gsj, respectively. three ttag mutants, carrying d197n, d326n and e264q substitutions, were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis to experimentally confirm the catalytic residues, and all the three mutants were inactive. the cd spectra were also checked and the gross conformation of the three mutants did not change . so d <dig>  d <dig>  and e <dig> were considered as ttag catalytic sites and h <dig> and h <dig> as its substrate-binding sites.

physical properties of the recombinant ttag
the effect of ph and temperature on recombinant ttag catalytic activity was determined using pnpg as a substrate. ttag showed maximum activity at ph  <dig>  and 90 °c and retained more than 60 % and 50 % activity at ph  <dig> - <dig>  and temperatures of 70 °c–95 °c, respectively. importantly, it retained 35 % activity at 100 °c, but showed almost no activity below 50 °c. ttag was stable over a wide range of ph values  at 50 °c, retaining over 80 % of its original activity after a 30-min incubation. ttag also demonstrated significant thermostability; it remained fully active after a 7-h incubation at 70 °c and showed a half-life of 210 min at 80 °c and 130 min at 90 °c, suggesting that it could be a good candidate for application in industrial settings. however, the thermostability of ttag was negatively affected by nacl indicating that salt was an adverse factor for enzyme stability at high temperatures.

the effect of various metal ions and chemicals on ttag enzymatic activity was examined after a 30-min incubation at 50 °c and ph  <dig> . al3+, hg2+, fe3+, li+, ce4+, ag+, fe2+, ni2+, and cu2+ significantly inhibited ttag activity, whereas mg2+, mn2+, ca2+, and edta had no effect, and pb2+ produced a 20 % increase. ttag was tolerant to 8 m urea, retaining approximately 95 % activity, but was sensitive to guanidine hydrochloride and sds, demonstrating only 20 % and 30 % activity after incubation with 4 m guanidine hydrochloride and 1 % sds, respectively.

substrate specificity and transglycosylation of ttag
the hydrolytic activity of ttag with various substrates was examined at 90 °c; kinetic parameters are shown in tables  <dig>  ttag was capable of cleaving sucrose , trehalose , panose , isomaltose , isomaltotriose, and aryl-substrate pnpg, with the highest specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg for pnpg . no activity was detected for p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, raffinose, melibiose, melezitose, maltooligosaccharides, starch, amylopectin, glycogen, pullulan, or dextrin. very low activity  for maltose  was observed only when the reaction time was increased to 2 h and excess enzyme was added. the km for pnpg was  <dig>  mm, which was lower than that for the other substrates. the ttag substrate preference was as follows: pnpg > isomaltotriose > isomaltose > trehalose > panose > sucrose . among natural substrates, ttag showed higher specificity for isomaltooligosaccharide than for other oligosaccharides. overall, these results indicate that ttag acts as an oligo- <dig> -glucosidase, which is consistent with the characteristics of gh <dig> α-glucosidases. α-glucosidases are further classified into three types according to their substrate specificity. type i hydrolyses aryl glucosides such as pnpg faster than short malto-oligosaccharides. however, type ii is more active on maltose and has low activity towards aryl glucosides, whereas type iii resembles type ii, but hydrolyses oligosaccharides and starch at similar rates  <cit> . from this substrate specificity, ttag belongs to type i α-glucosidase.table  <dig> kinetic parameters of recombinant ttag for hydrolysis of various substrates

to determine whether ttag could perform transglycosylation, it was incubated with 300 mm isomaltotriose, isomaltose, trehalose, panose, and sucrose for 3 h. tlc analysis of the reaction products revealed transglycosylation activity only with sucrose or trehalose as substrates. further analysis of ttag transglycosylation activity with trehalose and sucrose showed that the yield of transglycosylation products increased with the incubation time . the transglycosylation activity of ttag was confirmed by detection of reaction products after ttag incubation with 300 mm sucrose or trehalose for 20 h. hplc analysis revealed three major peaks corresponding to sucrose, glucose, and fructose, and two minor peaks corresponding to the products of a transglycosylation reaction with sucrose ; similarly, a small peak indicating a transglycosylation product was detected after ttag reaction with trehalose . these results further confirmed the transglycosylation activity of ttag with sucrose and trehalose.fig.  <dig> tlc and hplc chromatogram analysis of transglycosylation products. a tlc analysis of transglycosylation products when sucrose and trehalose at 300 mm were used as substrates for different incubation time. lane  <dig>  sucrose for 3 h; lane  <dig>  sucrose for 10 h; lane  <dig>  sucrose for 20 h; lane  <dig>  trehalose for 3 h; lane  <dig>  trehalose for 10 h; lane  <dig>  trehalose for 20 h; lane m, marker. g <dig>  glucose; g <dig>  maltose; g <dig>  maltotriose; g <dig>  maltotetraose; g <dig>  maltopentaose. b and  hplc chromatogram of the reaction mixture after 20 h of incubation when sucrose or trehalose was used as the substrate. f, fructose; g, glucose; s, sucrose; t, trehalose. the arrows indicate the new transglycosylation products



screening and biochemical properties of ttag mutants with improved thermostability
random mutagenesis by error prone pcr  was used to get thermostability improved variant of ttag. the ep-pcr library constructed using the megawhop method  <cit>  contained approximately 30 % inactive ttag variants. in general, one to five nucleotide mutations per gene were observed. the library was expressed using the auto induction system; the standard deviation was  <dig>  %, which conforms to the 10 % standard deviation in screening systems successfully used in directed evolution experiments  <cit> . the activity ratio of heat-treated to untreated bacteria was designated as residual activity and used to select mutants with improved thermostability; the selection criterion was an increase of at least 10 % in the residual activity of a mutant compared to the wild type after heat treatment. approximately  <dig>  ep-pcr library clones were screened and one mutant with increased thermostability carrying a single amino acid substitution of q10y was selected. under the screening conditions, the residual activity ratio of the wild-type ttag was approximately 15 %, whereas that of q10y mutant was approximately 38 %.

the q10y mutant and wild-type ttag were expressed in e. coli bl <dig>  and their thermostability was determined based on t <dig> and Δt <dig> values. the t <dig> of q10y was 97 °c, with Δt <dig> of 4 °c compared to the wild-type ttag . these results indicate that the thermostability of the q10y mutant was significantly increased compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. the substrate specificity of q10y mutant was also determined as similar to the wild-type ttag . the hydrolytic activity and kinetic parameters of the mutated and wild-type enzymes were determined at the optimal reaction conditions. the specific activity of q10y with pnpg was  <dig>  u/mg which decreased to approximately 82 % of that of wild-type tthag, indicating that the increase in thermostability was accompanied by a loss of enzymatic activity. the km of q10y was  <dig>  mm and similar to that of the wild-type indicating similar substrate binding ability. however, the kcat of q10y  decreased 46 % which resulted in about 44 % decrease of the kcat/km ratio . these data indicate that the mutation of q10y affected not only the thermostability but also the catalytic activity of ttag, suggesting that the mutated residue are located in close proximity to the active and/or substrate-binding sites and can affect catalysis. in order to further confirm the influence of q <dig> site for thermostability, saturation mutagenesis of the q <dig> site was done by site-directed mutagenesis. the results demonstrated that the t <dig> values of all  <dig> other mutants carrying single amino acid substitutions decreased compared to that of the wild-type enzyme , which means that only the q10y substitution in this site improved the thermostability of ttag. this single substitution q10y was firstly reported responsible for improvement of the thermal tolerance of α-glucosidase, and may help for guiding molecular engineering of other α-glucosidases for thermostability improvement.

discussion
in this study, we successfully expressed, purified and characterized the thermostable α-glucosidase ttag from t. thermophilus tc <dig>  although ttag and other reported thermus α-glucosidases similarly cannot hydrolyse the disaccharides cellobiose and melibiose or the trisaccharides raffinose and melizitose and are inactive for polysaccharides such as starch, amylopectin, glycogen, pullulan, and dextrin, there are still many differences in biochemical properties and substrate specificity between ttag and other thermus α-glucosidases, even though they demonstrate more than 90 % similarity with respect to amino acid sequence. ca2+ can activate the α-glucosidases aglhhb <dig> and aglhhb <dig> from t. thermophilus hb <dig> and tcaag from t. thermophilus gk <dig>  whereas pb2+ inhibits their activity. in contrast, ttag is activated by pb2+, whereas ca2+ has no effect. pb2+, as a heavy metal ion, generally inhibits the activity of most enzymes, including α-glucosidases  <cit> . therefore, ttag activation by pb2+ may indicate an interesting property different from that of other α-glucosidases. however, about this experimental observation, we actually cannot understand why based on our current knowledge. the optimal ph for ttag activity is  <dig> , whereas that for aglhhb <dig>  aglhhb <dig>  and tcaag was higher   <cit> , suggesting increased acid resistance. although ttag is similar to the other three thermus α-glucosidases in terms of optimal temperature  and ph tolerance, it demonstrates significant variations in other properties, indicating that ttag is an α-glucosidase with distinct biochemical characteristics.

the substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency of ttag and other reported thermus α-glucosidases are summarized in table  <dig>  similar to aglhhb <dig>  ttag can hydrolyse trehalose . however, the activity of aglhhb <dig> for isomaltose , isomaltotriose, and sucrose  was only  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  % of that for trehalose  <cit> , while the activity of ttag for the same substrates was  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively, indicating a preference of ttag for isomaltotriose over trehalose, which is different from the substrate specificity of aglhhb <dig>  in contrast to ttag and aglhhb <dig>  the α-glucosidase aglhhb <dig> and tcaag cannot hydrolyse trehalose  <cit>  and prefer isomaltose, whereas ttag and aglhhb <dig> are most active with pnpg and trehalose, respectively. meanwhile, all these four enzymes belong to type i α-glucosidases according to their substrate specifities. the activity towards sucrose may made ttag has potential application in high fructose syrup production.table  <dig> substrate specificity for oligosaccharides of α-glucosidase ttag, aglhhb <dig>  aglhhb <dig> and tcaag from thermus strains



the transglycosylation activity reported for many α-glucosidases has been exploited in biotechnology to produce food oligosaccharides or to conjugate sugars with biologically active materials  <cit> . aglhhb <dig> catalyses transglycosylation only in the presence of higher levels of trehalose or isomaltose and incubation for up to 24 h, whereas tcaag shows transglycosylation activity only with sucrose or isomaltose; however, ttag demonstrated transglycosylation with sucrose and trehalose after only 3 h, suggesting higher transglycosylation activity compared to that of other thermus α-glucosidases. although ttag shares approximately 90 % amino acid sequence identity with the homologous enzymes from t. thermophilus strains hb <dig> and hb <dig> and t. caldophilus gk <dig>  it has different substrate specificity, catalytic efficiency , and transglycosylation activity. it has been suggested that enzymes with high amino acid identity but different substrate specificity may have evolved through a limited number of amino acid substitutions to give rise to enzymes with broader substrate specificity or other related activities  <cit> .

the cd spectra were analyzed to determine whether the mutation affected the secondary structure. the results showed that there were no distinct changes between wild-type ttag and the q10y mutants . this meant that the thermostability improvements were not caused by secondary structural change. the ttag mutant q10y demonstrated increased thermostability but decreased enzymatic activity. to determine how the q10y mutation affected ttag thermostability, the 3d structure of ttag was modelled based on the structure of α-glucosidase gsj from geobacillus sp. strain hta- <dig>  as a template, using the swiss-model software online. the procheck analysis showed that  <dig>  % of the residues were in the most favoured regions and  <dig>  % of the residues were in additional regions, indicating the reliability of the modelled structure. as shown in fig. 4a, q <dig> is located in the β-barrel of the catalytic domain, in close proximity to the catalytic and substrate-binding sites d <dig> and h <dig>  respectively; therefore, q10y substitution would probably influence ttag substrate binding and/or catalytic efficiency, resulting in a decrease in enzymatic activity. q10y substitution in the ttag catalytic centre enhances ttag thermostability, probably by stabilisation of the catalytic domain. in the structure of the homologous enzyme gsj, a hydrogen bond is formed between q <dig> and i <dig>  located on different β-sheets  <cit> . in ttag, the homologous amino acids q <dig> and w <dig>  respectively, are also located on two adjacent β-sheets with the distance of  <dig>  Å , which is sufficient for the formation of a hydrogen bond. similarly, hydrogen bonds can be formed between the amino group of y <dig> and the carboxyl of w <dig> and between the hydroxyl of y <dig> benzene ring and the amino group of his <dig>  which are also located in the adjacent β-sheets with a distance of  <dig>  Å . saturation mutagenesis of the q <dig> site demonstrated that the t <dig> values of all  <dig> other mutants carrying single amino acid substitutions  decreased compared to that of the wild-type enzyme, likely because the mutated proteins could not form additional hydrogen bonds. because hydrogen bonding is considered to directly influence protein thermostability  <cit> , we hypothesize that additional hydrogen bonding in the q10y mutant could account for its increased thermostability. in addition, among the other  <dig> saturation mutants, only q10e demonstrated the same enzymatic activity as the wild type ttag , probably because of similarities in terms of structure and size between glutamine and glutamiс acid, which differ only in charge , suggesting an important role of q <dig> for ttag enzymatic activity.fig.  <dig> far-uv cd spectra of ttga and mutant q10y.  ttag;  q10y

q <dig> is located also close to a possible hydrophobic core formed by y <dig>  y <dig>  f <dig>  w <dig>  l <dig>  y <dig>  and y <dig> . a previous study determined that the hydrophobic amino acid content is marginally higher in thermophiles than in mesophiles, which can increase protein rigidity and hydrophobicity  <cit> , thus suggesting a role of hydrophobic interactions in protein thermostability . tyrosine is more hydrophobic than glutamine; hence, q10y substitution may strengthen hydrophobic interactions between this and other tyrosines of the ttag hydrophobic core, resulting in enhanced thermostability. however, even though some other amino acids are more hydrophobic than glutamine, only the substitution of q10y stabilized ttag; therefore, we suggest that a combination of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions of mutation q10y resulted in improved thermostability for ttag.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, a highly thermostable and acidic α-glucosidase, ttag, from t. thermophilus tc <dig> was cloned, expressed, and characterized. although ttag shares approximately 90 % amino acid identity with the homologous α-glucosidases from other t. thermophilus strains, it has distinct biochemical characteristics, which indicates that ttag is an α-glucosidase with potential biotechnological applications. the ttag mutant carrying the single amino acid substitutions q10y demonstrated enhanced thermostability. structure modelling and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions were responsible for the increased thermostability imparted by q10y. our findings provide new insights into the catalytic and thermal tolerance mechanisms of α-glucosidases, which may guide molecular engineering of thermostable enzymes for industrial applications. furthermore, crystallization and real 3d structure resolution of ttag in the future would deepen the understanding of catalysis by α-glucosidase and facilitate the thermal adaptation of thermostable enzymes.

colonies grown on lb-kanamycin  agar plates were transferred, by using toothpicks, into 96-well microtiter plates containing 150 μl of mdg non-inducing medium  <cit>  in each well supplemented with kanamycin . two wells of each 96-well microtiter plate contained wild-type ttag colonies. after 20 h of cultivation in a microtiter plate shaker , each well was replicated by using a replicator  into a second series of 96-well microtiter plates containing 150 μl of induction medium md- <dig>  <cit>  supplemented with kanamycin . the first set of plates was stored at −80 °c after addition of glycerol. the clones in the second set of plates were cultivated for 15 h in the microtiter plate shaker and used for screening.

a 20-fold dilution of the cell culture  was transferred into a 96-well pcr plate and then incubated at 99 °c for 60 min in a thermal cycler ; then, 5 μl of the incubated cell culture was transferred into another 96-well pcr plate with 70 μl of na2hpo4-citric acid buffer including  <dig>  mm pnpg  in each well. the reaction was performed at 90 °c for 5 min and then terminated by addition of 75 μl of 1 m na2co <dig> solution. the residual activity was determined by the absorbance at 410 nm. mutants in which the residual activity  was at least 10 % higher than that of the wild-type enzyme were preliminarily considered to have improved thermostability.

thermostability determination of wild-type and mutant enzymes
the mutant enzymes with potential improvement of thermostability were expressed and purified as described above. t <dig> and Δt <dig>  were used to evaluate the thermostability of wild-type and mutant α-glucosidases according to the method of eijsink et al.  <cit> . the purified recombinant wild-type enzyme  and other mutated enzymes were incubated for 15 min at 90 °c to 99 °c at a concentration of 2 μg/ml in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer . the residual activity of the heated solution was assessed as described above.

3d structure modeling and site mutagenesis
the tertiary structure of ttag was modeled by swiss-model server on line , using the structure of α-glucosidase gsj from geobacillus sp. strain hta- <dig>  as a template, which showed the highest identity with ttag in the pdb database and also belongs to gh family  <dig>  figures were developed using pymol™  <dig> .x. the reliability of the modelled structure of ttag was checked by procheck software online . site mutagenesis was done using the quikchange® site-directed mutagenesis kit . the recombinant plasmid, pet28a-ttag, was used as the template. the mutagenesis pcr products were transformed into e. coli xl1-blue  directly after dpni digestion. dna sequencing was performed by sinogenomax co., ltd, china. the correct mutant plasmid was then transformed into e. coli bl <dig>  for expression.
