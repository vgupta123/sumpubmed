BACKGROUND
it was established before the advent of dna sequencing that organisms show incredible variation in genome size. this presented a paradox because scientists originally expected a positive relationship between genome size and organism complexity  <cit> . the paradox was partially resolved by partitioning overall genome size into two compartments: protein coding vs non-protein coding. this partition showed that organisms tend to have similar numbers of genes but non-coding and presumptively non-functional portions of genomes vary greatly  <cit> . in recent years, perception has changed; it is well-established that non-genic regions of genomes encode regulatory and structural information, and functional rnas  <cit> . surprisingly, almost all of the genome is transcribed in some organisms, not simply the protein-coding portion  <cit> . some repetitive sequence classes that were thought to only selfishly expand genome size at the expense of the host are known to regulate transcription and contribute to gene evolution  <cit> . genomes contain large non-coding regions that are conserved across species  <cit> , and lineage-specific, non-coding dna between distantly related species is associated with the same regulatory functions; such patterns are consistent with non-coding dna having a regulatory function  <cit> . finally, the amount of non-coding dna does scale with developmental complexity in some comparative studies  <cit> . these findings are motivating renewed interest into genome diversity and function. unfortunately, dna sequence data are completely lacking for organisms with large genomes.

in this study,  <dig> dna sequencing was used to obtain the first glimpse of a salamander genome. the mexican axolotl  was selected because it is a model organism with an average-sized salamander genome: ~ <dig> ×  <dig> bp distributed among  <dig> haploid chromosomes  <cit> . considering the possibility of extensive repetitive dna tracts in the axolotl genome that would confound downstream sequence assembly, it was reasoned that genic regions of the genome would be less likely to contain repetitive dna. also, recent analyses suggest that regulatory elements within the human genome tend to be associated with the location of known genes  <cit> . thus, a partial bac library was developed and pcr screening identified  <dig> clones that contain expressed sequence tags   <cit> . this allowed direct comparison of orthologous genic regions between axolotl and the human genome and analysis of two bacs that contained presumptively novel axolotl transcripts. to complement this approach, computational analyses were used to search existing est databases for genes that are specific to axolotls and perhaps other amphibians. the results from these analyses, discussed below, begin to address the basis of the axolotl's large genome size and the significance of excess dna in genic regions.

RESULTS
bac sequence assembly and annotation
a small bac library  was constructed and screened by pcr to identify  <dig> clones that contained coding sequences for previously identified ests . altogether, these clones span more than  <dig>  megabases  of the axolotl genome. bac clones were end-sequenced using the abi-sanger method and then  <dig> sequencing technology was used to generate several thousand, high quality sequence reads for each clone . sequence assembly statistics  indicate that high quality assemblies were generated for each bac; seven bac assemblies yielded a single long contig and three bac assemblies yielded two contigs separated by single gaps. the sequence coverage provided by the assemblies approximated the estimated size of bac clones on agarose gels . the remaining assemblies consisted of  <dig> or fewer large contigs. the reason why a few contigs yielded incomplete assemblies is not clear because different numbers of high quality reads were obtained for each bac and contig numbers within assemblies were not correlated with sequencing depth. however, in only one case was it clear  that repetitive sequences confounded contig assembly of a bac . indeed, very few repetitive dna sequences were identified overall within axolotl bacs, with retrotransposons representing the largest fraction . these results suggest that genic regions of the axolotl are not completely structured by repetitive sequences. annotated bac assemblies have been deposited in genbank .

a – start codon was not identified, but it is likely present in assembled sequence. b – this bac contains a presumptive processed pseudogene. the aligning bac and cdna sequence are 91% identical and the bac sequence contains no introns. c – not used in multispecies alignments due to lack of obvious vertebrate orthologies. d – exons were identified on two different contigs. e – not considered in multispecies alignments due to redundancy with h3_1d <dig>  f – contig was originally identified as cytochrome c.

introns and exons within bacs
to further investigate the structure of genic regions within the axolotl genome, introns and exons were identified within bacs and compared to orthologous sequences from humans. blast analysis confirmed the presence of targeted est sequences within  <dig> of  <dig> bac assemblies. the length of orthologous coding sequences between axolotl and humans is highly conserved, as is the location of exon/intron boundaries . however, axolotl introns are strikingly longer than human introns: within five genes for which orthology could be firmly established, axolotl introns average  <dig> bp while human introns average only  <dig> bp . further comparisons show that axolotl introns are approximately 14× larger than orthologous introns from chicken  and 12× larger than orthologous introns from xenopus tropicalis  . thus, non-coding genic regions are contributing significantly more to axolotl genome size than they are to vertebrates with "average-sized" genomes.

composition of axolotl introns
it is possible that axolotl introns are large because they contain dna sequence classes that are unique or over-represented in comparison to other vertebrates. to test this idea, all axolotl introns and orthologous human introns were searched for self-similarity, repetitive dnas , and non-coding rnas . examination of individual self-self intron alignments and alignment of the concatenated intron dataset revealed that axolotl introns do not contain extensive tracts of repetitive dna and are composed of largely unique sequence . multiple retroelement types were identified in axolotl introns in the selected genes but none were identified in the orthologous human introns . although the human genome contains many repeat classes, the only repeats identified in this sample of human introns were dna transposons. the proportion of nucleotides accounted for by interspersed repetitive sequences is significantly higher in axolotl introns, relative to human introns . a total of  <dig> candidate mirna precursors and  <dig> snornas  were identified from sense dna strands of the axolotl . the mirnas totaled  <dig> kb and the snornas totaled  <dig>  kb for a total contribution of  <dig> % to overall intron length. by way of comparison, computational searches of  <dig> orthologous human introns  identified  <dig> candidate mirnas,  <dig> cd type snorna, and no candidate haca type snornas ; none of these human introns contain annotated mirnas or snornas within the current human genome assembly  <cit> . thus, the density of predicted small, intronic ncrnas is significantly higher in axolotls than in humans . these analyses show that axolotl introns contain a greater diversity of transposable elements and potentially functional dna sequence elements than human introns.

the high density of predicted mirna structures within axolotl introns could be an artifact of the methods that were used to identify candidate mirnas, or could represent other complex hairpin sequences that do not enter mirna processing. to investigate this further, predicted mirna sequences were aligned to  <dig>  small rna sequences that were recently characterized from amputated and regenerating axolotl limbs . this new axolotl mirna database will be described elsewhere. two of the predicted mirnas from axolotl introns had stem regions that aligned perfectly with mature mirna sequences from the axolotl limb mirna database : ammirna <dig> aligned to a single  <dig> bp sequence and ammirna <dig> aligned to three independently sampled  <dig> bp sequences. these perfect alignments suggest that some of the predicted elements within axolotl introns are likely to be bona fide mirna genes.

novel genes
two of the bacs in this study were selected because they contain transcripts with no known homolog in other vertebrates . results from microarray analyses predict a role for these "no-hit" est contigs in two unique salamander developmental processes: metamorphosis and regeneration. the no-hit transcript that is encoded on h3_4a <dig>  is significantly downregulated during spinal cord regeneration, while the no-hit transcript that is encoded on h3_61c <dig>  is significantly upregulated during spinal cord regeneration and downregulated during skin metamorphosis  <cit> . although some no-hit ests are truncated versions of known genes, it is possible that many of the ~ <dig> no-hit transcripts in the ambystoma est database correspond to novel axolotl genes. annotation of axolotl no-hit est/bac alignments supports the later hypothesis. two novel genes, axnovel_ <dig> and axnovel_ <dig>  were identified within h3_4a <dig> and h3_61c <dig>  respectively. these novel genes correspond to the no-hit transcripts described above. unexpectedly, a group of no-hit ests aligned to a second region of h3_4a <dig> that is distinct from axnovel_ <dig>  these alignments predict a third novel gene  that has introns and is spliced . none of these three genes show sequence similarity to any known vertebrate gene.

to determine if these novel genes encode proteins or non-coding rnas, est/bac sequence alignments were manually curated and searched for open reading frames  using orf finder at ncbi  <cit> . in all three cases the longest orf was oriented 5' to 3' relative to the est sequences. axnovel_ <dig> and axnovel_ <dig> can be translated into long orfs  that are initiated with a start methionine and terminated by a stop codon. manual curation of axnovel_ <dig> revealed several small exons that were not identified by automated sequence alignments . the coding sequence spans eight small 5' exons that range in length from  <dig> to  <dig> bp and extends  <dig> bp into a longer 3' exon that contains the presumptive 3' utr of this gene. nearly the entire length of axnovel_ <dig>  can be translated into a single orf with a stop codon. the only in-frame methionine codon is located in the middle of the orf, however the first codon of the longest orf is ctg, so it is possible that this gene uses an alternative cug start codon  <cit> . interestingly, orthologous est sequences have also been sampled for axnovel_ <dig> in a. tigrinum tigrinum, a close relative. the a. t. tigrinum contig shares >98% nucleotide identity with axnovel_ <dig> and also encodes a 5' cug. it is unclear if axnovel_ <dig> is translated into a functional protein or if it functions as a ncrna; however maintenance of gene structure and sequence identity between salamander species that diverged several million years ago supports the idea that it is functional.

the most likely mechanism for the origin of novel, functional genes in the ambystoma genome is gene duplication, as there is no evidence for whole genome duplication in a. mexicanum. it is important to consider the possibility that the large ambystoma genome may have been shaped by a higher rate of gene duplication and fewer gene losses, and thus contain a greater overall number of genes. if paralogous loci are abundant in the ambystoma genome, then many salamander genes are expected to show relatively more, many-to-one orthology relationships with genes from other vertebrates. to test this hypothesis, paralogs were predicted for a high quality, human-salamander ortholog dataset , wherein primary axolotl orthologs were required to cover > 89% of the annotated length of each primary human ortholog. approximately 86%  of the human-axolotl gene pairs in this dataset were predicted to be 1: <dig> orthologs . many: many ortholog groups were predicted for  <dig> human-axolotl gene sets  and include members from gene families that are notorious for gene duplication and gene conversion events . of the remaining gene pairs,  <dig> × more paralogs were predicted for axolotl primary orthologs . specifically, one or more human paralogs correspond to  <dig> human primary orthologs, yielding  <dig> different paralogs overall. in comparison,  <dig> primary axolotl orthologs correspond to  <dig> different axolotl paralogs. the list of axolotl specific paralogs include annexin a <dig> , ferritin heavy polypeptide , h <dig> histone family 3a , calmodulin  <dig> , and matrix metalloproteinase  <dig> . the largest number of axolotl paralogs  was identified for paternally expressed  <dig> isoform rf <dig> , an imprinted mammalian gene that shows sequence similarity to retrotransposons. as these axolotl paralogs exhibit higher sequence similarity to fish pol polyproteins  <cit>  than human peg <dig>  they probably correspond to an active retrotransposon family in the axolotl genome. overall, these data predict 2% more duplicated loci in the axolotl genome versus the human genome , and more paralogs are predicted on average for axolotl duplicated loci . these estimates support the hypothesis of more lineage specific genes in the axolotl genome than the human genome. assuming these genes also contain longer introns, the genic portion of the axolotl genome is predicted to exceed the total genome size of some vertebrates .

discussion
comparative dna sequence data are needed from large genomes to better understand structural and functional features that influence genome size evolution. this study demonstrates that dna sequence data can be sampled efficiently from the large genome of the mexican axolotl using  <dig> dna sequencing. it was possible to assemble de novo short-dna sequence reads  from shot gun sequenced bacs into complete contigs, and then use this information to reveal the structure of genic regions of the genome. the results show that axolotl genic regions encode novel genes and make a significant contribution to genome size. in particular, axolotl introns are 5–10× longer than introns in other vertebrates and this maybe typical of salamander genomes  <cit> .

many different ideas have been proposed to explain genome size variation among organisms. the simplest explanation is a change in the ratio of dna that codes for proteins versus non-protein coding dna  <cit> . although variation in gene number maybe important, this distinction is too simple because non-protein coding dna has been shown in recent years to encode a diversity of functional elements. for example, protein-coding sequences  are associated with introns that encode a diversity of regulatory elements and non-coding rnas that affect transcription, translation, and chromatin structure  <cit> . in order to understand the relationship between genome size and regulatory complexity, it is therefore critical to consider the proportion of dna that resides in transcribed  versus non-transcribed  dna. changes in genome size that occur over relatively short evolutionary timeframes may not result in a correlated expansion of genic regions , presumably due to greater evolutionary consrtaint  <cit> . however, positive correlations are observed between genome size and the number and length of introns at a broader evolutionary scale  <cit> . correlations observed at this broader scale are presumably the outcome of drift and selection as population sizes and functional constraints fluctuate over millions of generations  <cit> . salamanders are particularly interesting in this regard because they present a situation wherein large genomes are the rule rather than the exception. very large genomes have likely been maintained within this group at least since the divergence of the ancestral salamander lineage > <dig> million years ago  <cit> . thus, salamanders can provide novel insight into the evolutionary potential of vertebrate genomes over deep, evolutionary time.

at this point we can only speculate about the reasons why large introns evolved in a. mexicanum. in general, introns tend to be longer in genes that have tissue specific or developmentally relevant functions, than introns in house keeping or widely expressed genes  <cit> . this pattern may reflect evolution of complex transcriptional regulatory mechanisms  <cit> . it is possible that salamanders maintain large introns in-part because they encode information necessary to accomplish unique developmental processes. in particular, salamanders are capable of complex tissue regeneration, and a single genome can express both a metamorphic and paedomorphic outcome  <cit> . these processes involve transcriptional activation and silencing of thousands of genes that may depend upon transcriptional binding sites and ncrnas within introns. that large salamander introns might have a functional role is supported by the absence of shared repetitive sequences among introns and the prediction of numerous mirna and snorna genes in axolotl introns. it is also possible that long introns indirectly moderate cellular and developmental processes by influencing transcription and mitotic rates  <cit> . we note that the predicted repetitive dnas and ncrnas only account for a small proportion of total intron size. characterization of additional axolotl genes, and in particular genes that function in regeneration and metamorphosis, will help optimize searches for other functional and structural elements  that are associated with large intron size, including "junk" dna.

CONCLUSIONS
results from this study show that the genic compartment of the ambystoma genome is incredibly large. our analysis suggests that genes in the axolotl genome are 5× larger than they are in humans and conservative estimation of lineage specific genes predicts more genes in the salamander genome than the human genome. if there are approximately 2% more genes in the axolotl genome than a  <dig>  gene estimate for the human genome, and each salamander gene is on average 5× larger than a  <dig> kilobase average estimate for human genes  <cit> , the genic portion of the ambystoma genome is estimated to be a staggering  <dig>  gigabases! thus, the large salamander genome is not simply large because of excess, repetitive dna; the genic component is also correspondingly large. equally staggering is the fact that our estimate of genic content only accounts for 1/12th of the total genome size of  <dig> gigabases. even if considerably more genes are discovered to be novel in the axolotl genome, using more aggressive computational approaches to identify highly divergent proteins, this is not likely to solve the mystery of large genome size in salamanders. additional, dna sequencing is needed to solve this mystery and this study shows that new sequencing technologies allow such datasets to be readily generated for organisms with large genomes.
