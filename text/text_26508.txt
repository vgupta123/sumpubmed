BACKGROUND
as sessile organisms, plants utilize hormones to adapt to developmental and environmental changes  <cit> . among these hormones are the gibberellins, a large family of diterpenoid compounds that were first identified for their ability to stimulate the growth and elongation of rice seedlings  <cit> , and have since been found to have diverse roles in plant development. these physiological functions often differ between species, and include involvement in stem elongation, pollen maturation, seed germination, transition from vegetative growth to flowering, and fruit development  <cit> .

the endogenous biosynthesis and catabolism of gibberellins within plants, as well as the gibberellin response pathway, have been described in detail previously  <cit> . in brief, gibberellin biosynthesis in higher plants can be divided into three stages :  production of ent-kaurene in proplastids;  conversion of ent-kaurene to ga <dig> via microsomal cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases; and  formation of c20- and c19−gas in the cytoplasm  <cit> . following its biosynthesis, gibberellin signaling in arabidopsis is initiated through its binding to the ga insensitive dwarf <dig>  receptor. this allows subsequent interaction between gid <dig> and della proteins , which are transcriptional repressors that when unbound by gid <dig> down-regulate gibberellin response genes  <cit> . in the presence of gibberellin, the stable gid1-ga-della complexes are recognized by the f-box protein sleepy <dig> -based scfsly <dig> complex, which ubiquitylates the della proteins and causes their degradation by the 26s proteasome  <cit> .figure  <dig>

the exogenous pre-bloom application of gibberellic acid  to grapevine, which is an economically important crop that has long been an important component of the human diet, is commonly used to induce seedlessness  <cit> , establish early ripening  <cit> , and enhance berry size in seedless cultivars  <cit> . however, despite its importance in viticulture, the precise mechanism by which ga elicits these complex outcomes remains elusive. furthermore, the data that has accumulated thus far is somewhat conflicting. for instance, it has been reported that seedlessness induced by the application of ga <dig> to grape flowers before or during anthesis severely inhibited pollen germination and pollen tube growth  <cit> , possibly due to the biosynthesis of pollen tube inhibitor, leading to the production of unfertilized ovules  <cit> . conversely, our previous research suggested that ovules were fertilized normally and that the induced seedlessness following ga <dig> treatment may have been caused, at least in part, by an impairment of redox homeostasis in flowers/berries resulting in oxidative damage to the seeds  <cit> .

transcriptome sequences generated using high throughput techniques are more efficient, data-rich, and economical than est-based and traditional pcr-based methods  <cit> . in grapevine, which is the first fruit crop to have its entire genome sequenced  <cit> , transcriptome sequencing has been conducted to identify micrornas that are responsive to ga <dig> application  <cit> . unfortunately, information regarding large-scale transcriptome alterations in response to exogenous ga <dig> application in grape remains scarce.

therefore, in an effort to advance our understanding of the response to exogenous ga <dig> application in grape, we carried out rna-seq transcriptome analysis of grape flowers with and without ga <dig> treatment at two separate time-points using illumina sequencing technology. subsequent comparison of the global expression profiles of ga3-treated and untreated grape flowers allowed the identification of numerous ga3-responsive genes. further detailed analyses of these genes yielded novel insight into ga3-response in grape, the results of which provide a number of putative candidate genes or markers that have the potential to be used to guide future studies in this field.

methods
plant material, ga <dig> treatment, and gibberellin content assay
seeded grape cultivar ‘kyoho’  plants were grown in an 8-year-old vineyard situated in an experimental field of northwest a&f university, yangling, shaanxi, china . fifteen clusters were allowed to remain on each vine, and treatment was carried out  <dig> d before full bloom. initially, clusters were soaked in  <dig> % tween- <dig>  for 3 s to enhance subsequent uptake of the phytohormone. ga <dig> treatment was then carried out by soaking clusters in 100 mg l− <dig> ga <dig>  dissolved in a small amount of 100% ethanol for 5 s  <cit> . untreated control clusters were subject to the same process without ga <dig> 

for the gibberellin content assay, samples  were collected immediately 1 h, 12 h, 24 h and 72 h post-ga <dig> application. extracts were purified and 30 μl of each sample were subjected to hplc analysis using a reverse phase column as described previously  <cit> . analysis conditions were as follows: column temperature of 30°c; mobile phase of methanol and  <dig> % acetic acid ; and flow rate of  <dig>  ml min− <dig>  statistical analyses of the data were conducted using independent-samples t-tests with the spss software .

rna isolation
two biological replicates were used for all rna-seq experiments from each sample. flowers collected from five independent vines were pooled to isolate rna and were considered as one biological replicate. treatment time points were 1 h and 24 h post-treatment for isolation of total rna isolation, which was carried out using the e.z.n.a. ® plant rna kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions . rna quality and quantity was assessed on a  <dig> % denatured agarose gel and nanodrop  <dig> spectrophotometer , respectively.

rna-seq analysis
strand-specific rna-seq libraries were constructed as previously described  <cit>  and two biological replicates were sequenced on an illumina hiseq  <dig> system using the single-end mode for each treatment. the length of the reads was 50 bp. rna-seq reads were first aligned to ribosomal rna sequences using bowtie  <cit>  and aligned sequences were removed. the resulting filtered reads were then aligned to the grape genome using tophat  <cit> . following alignment, the count of mapped reads from each sample was derived and normalized to reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads . differentially expressed genes  between ga3-treated and control samples at each time point were identified using the deseq  <dig> . <dig> package  <cit>  with the raw count data. raw p values were adjusted for multiple testing using a false discovery rate   <cit> . genes with an fdr of less than  <dig>  and fold-changes greater than  <dig> were regarded as degs. gene ontology  functional classification in the set of differentially expressed genes and pathways that were affected by ga <dig> treatment were identified using the plant metgenmap system  <cit> .

quantitative rt-pcr analysis
quantitative real-time rt-pcr was carried out on two independent biological replicates of each sample, as well as three technical replicates, using a bio-rad iq <dig> thermo cycler . for each sample, 1 μg of total rna was converted into cdna using primescript ™ rtase and an oligo dt primer  and was subsequently diluted six times with sterile water. quantitative rt-pcr was performed using takara sybr premix ex taq™ ii  and twelve primers set specific to known grape transcription factors . cycling parameters were 95°c for 30 s, 40 cycles of 95°c for 5 s, and 60°c for 30 s. for melting curve analysis, a program including 95°c for 15 s, followed by a constant increase from 60°c to 95°c, was included following the pcr cycles. the grape actin <dig> gene  was amplified with primers f  and r  as an internal control. relative expression levels were analyzed using the iq <dig> software and the normalized-expression method.

RESULTS
morphological changes in inflorescences in response to ga <dig> application
to ascertain the effects of ga <dig> application on grapevine inflorescences, berries, and seed development, morphological analyses were carried out on grapevine inflorescence clusters that had been treated with solution bearing or lacking ga <dig>  respectively,  <dig> d before full bloom. at  <dig> d post-treatment, the flowers of ga3-treated inflorescences had begun to open, while untreated flowers remained closed , suggesting that ga stimulated the rate of flower development. subsequently, as grape berries grew, the fruit of ga3-treated plants began to develop purple coloration  <dig> d after treatment , while berries from untreated control plants remained fully green at this time point . finally, as expected, while seeds developed normally in untreated control berries, seedlessness was induced following ga <dig> application .figure  <dig>

effect of ga <dig> treatment on gibberellin content
to determine the effect of ga <dig> application on gibberellin content, we assayed the amount of this phytohormone in grape flowers harvested 1 h, 12 h, 24 h and 72 h following ga <dig> treatment. as shown in figure  <dig>  ga <dig> application increased flower gibberellin content from 1 h to 24 h following treatment, with differences being significant at 1 h and 12 h post-application. conversely, by 72 h following ga <dig> treatment, gibberellin content dropped to levels that were significantly less than those seen in untreated controls . by 6 days post-treatment gibberellin levels had evened out between treated and untreated controls .figure  <dig>

rna-seq analysis of ga3-treated and untreated grape flower transcriptomes
since the gibberellin content of grape flowers was found to be increased between 1 h to 24 h following ga <dig> treatment, flowers were collected 1 h and 24 h after treatment with solution bearing or lacking ga <dig>  and were used for rna isolation and subsequent illumina hiseq  <dig> sequencing. a total of eight samples were analyzed, with each condition having two biological replicates. after removing rrna contaminated reads, clean reads were obtained . reads mapping to the genome sequence made up approximately 80% of the reads, with the exception of one untreated 24 h post-treatment replicate . to further investigate the robustness of our rna-seq dataset, the correlation coefficients of the transcriptome profiles among the eight samples were calculated and were found to reach  <dig>  between each set of biological replicates .

differential expression and gene ontology  functional classification of ga3-treated and untreated grape flower transcriptomes
the transcript abundance of each gene was estimated by reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads  and the deseq  <dig> . <dig> package was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed  between ga3-treated and untreated control samples . using a very stringent cutoff value,  <dig>  genes with increased transcript abundance and  <dig> genes with decreased transcript abundance were identified in grape flowers 1 h after ga <dig> treatment . interestingly, an even larger number of genes exhibited differential expression 24 h following ga <dig> treatment, with  <dig>  genes displaying increased transcript abundance and  <dig>  genes showing decreased transcript abundance. as shown in figure 4b, among these differentially expressed genes,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up-regulated only in grape flowers 1 h or 24 h following ga <dig> treatment, respectively ;  <dig> and  <dig> genes were down-regulated only in grape flowers 1 h or 24 h following ga <dig> treatment, respectively ;  <dig> genes were down-regulated 1 h after ga <dig> treatment and then up-regulated 24 h after ga <dig> treatment ;  <dig> genes were up-regulated 1 h after ga <dig> treatment and then down-regulated 24 h after ga <dig> treatment ; and somewhat surprisingly, only  <dig> genes were simultaneously down-regulated both 1 h and 24 h following ga <dig> treatment . among these simultaneously down-regulated genes, genes encoding a pelota protein, a putative aspartic proteinase nepenthesin- <dig> precursor, a putative hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, a kelch repeat-containing f-box family protein and two hypothetical proteins were included.figure  <dig>

many degs with functions within the biological process category of go were observed . for instance, a large number of genes were identified that displayed increased or decreased transcript abundance both 1 h and 24 h after ga <dig> treatment that play a role in cellular, metabolic and biosynthetic processes, response to stress, and transport. in addition, numerous other degs fell within a number of other interesting groups, including relating to reproduction, pollination, ripening, cell death, as well as flower, embryonic and post-embryonic development. many of the degs identified above  were found to be involved in multiple biological processes, and those exhibiting a ≥  <dig> fold change from untreated samples are presented in additional file  <dig>  at 1 h post-ga <dig> treatment, genes encoding a putative receptor protein kinase, polygalacturonase , guanine nucleotide exchange factor, nac domain protein and putative mads-box transcription factor were up-regulated, while genes encoding purple acid phosphatase and rop guanine nucleotide exchange factor were down-regulated. at 24 h post-ga <dig> treatment, genes encoding a lipid a export atp-binding/permease protein msba, nac domain protein, putative polygalacturonase, leucine-rich repeat receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase, putative receptor protein kinase, guanine nucleotide exchange factor and putative mads-box transcription factor were down-regulated, while genes encoding purple acid phosphatase and gibberellin 20-oxidase were up-regulated.figure  <dig>

treatment based on the biological process of gene ontology .




we also analyzed degs based on their molecular function, as well as their cellular component . within the molecular function category, groups with the highest abundance of degs included those relating to protein binding and catalytic activity, while other interesting groups included nucleotide and carbohydrate binding, as well as hydrolase, transferase, transporter, receptor, signal transducer and transcription factor activities . within the cellular component category, the greatest number of degs fell within the plasma membrane, nucleus, and cytoplasm groups .

effect of ga <dig> treatment on gibberellin biosynthetic and signaling pathway-related genes
a large number of degs with involvement in ga biosynthetic and signaling pathways were also identified . the expression of the ga biosynthesis gene ks  was up-regulated 1 h following ga <dig> treatment and down-regulated 24 h following treatment. in addition, genes encoding ga20oxs  and ga3ox  were down-regulated following ga <dig> application. the expression of genes encoding the ga-inactivating enzymes, ga2oxs, also exhibited differential expression following the application of ga <dig>  while gsvivg <dig> and gsvivg <dig> were up-regulated 1 h and 24 h following treatment, respectively, gsvivg <dig> was down-regulated 24 h after treatment. this feedback mechanism also appears to operate at the level of ga perception, with ga <dig> negatively regulating the expression of the gibberellin receptor gid <dig> . of the seven grape genes encoding gid <dig>  gsvivg <dig> and gsvivg <dig> were down-regulated 1 h after treatment, while gsvivg <dig>  gsvivg <dig>  gsvivg <dig>  gsvivg <dig> and gsvivg <dig> were down-regulated 24 h after treatment. in contrast, with the exception of gsvivg <dig>  the remaining four genes encoding della proteins exhibited up-regulation following ga <dig> treatment.

ga3-responsive transcription factors
a large number of differentially expressed ga3-responsive transcription factors  were identified in this study . in total,  <dig>  and  <dig>  degs were classed into  <dig> distinct transcription factor families 1 h and 24 h after ga <dig> treatment, respectively. one hour following treatment,  <dig> genes encoding transcription factors were found to be up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated. similarly,  <dig> genes encoding transcription factors were found to be up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated 24 h after ga <dig> application. the majority of transcription factor-encoding degs were members of the ap2/erebp family, followed by myb, bhlh, wrky, nac, and arf families. in the case of the ap2/erebp family,  <dig> genes were up-regulated 1 h following ga <dig> treatment, whereas  <dig> genes were down-regulated 24 h post-treatment. similarly, degs belonging to the wrky, nac, tify, gras, mads-box and platz families were for the most part induced 1 h following ga <dig> treatment and repressed 24 h post-treatment. in the case of both myb and bhlh family degs, a higher number of up-regulated genes were observed  <dig> and 24 h post-treatment than down-regulated genes. in the case of arf, grf, hb, tcp and zf-hd family degs, there generally tended to be more up-regulation occurring at 24 h post-treatment than down-regulation.figure  <dig>

quantitative real-time rt-pcr  validation of degs from rna-seq
to further validate our rna-seq expression profile data, we performed qrt-pcr assays on twelve genes encoding a selection of transcription factors . our qrt-pcr results revealed that in every case, the expression trends of these genes corresponded to our rna-seq data. to obtain measurements of the correlation between the rna-seq and qrt-pcr data, we generated scatterplots using the log <dig> -fold change between rna-seq and qrt-pcr data  and found a close correlation  between the two methods.figure  <dig>

ga3-induced pathways in grape flowers
in order to assess the functional roles of ga3-responsive genes involved in different biochemical pathways, we identified the pathways affected by ga <dig> application based on our expression profiling analyses. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> biochemical pathways were significantly affected by ga <dig> treatment  at 1 h and 24 h following application, respectively . these pathways comprised the biosynthesis or degradation of diverse metabolites including hormones, sugars and polysaccharides, amino acids, fatty acids and lipids, and secondary metabolites.figure  <dig> 
pathways controlled by genes exhibiting alterations in their expression levels after ga

treatment. numbers on the color bar indicate -log , where p value represents the significance. p value ≤ <dig> .



among the hormone-related pathways, jasmonic acid biosynthesis , salicylate biosynthesis , ethylene biosynthesis from methionine , cytokinin degradation  and gibberellin biosynthesis  included degs that exhibited significant alterations following ga <dig> application. in the case of the jasmonic acid biosynthetic pathway, degs were up-regulated 1 h after treatment and were down-regulated 24 h after treatment, and included lipoxygenases, allene oxide synthases, allene oxide cyclase and 12-oxophytodienoate reductases . in terms of ethylene biosynthesis from methionine , the gene encoding the key enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase  was up-regulated 1 h following treatment and down-regulated 24 h following treatment, while two other genes  were down-regulated 24 h following treatment. furthermore, the expression of five genes encoding cytokinin oxidases , which are involved in cytokinin degradation, were induced by more than 36-fold 24 h following ga <dig> treatment . intriguingly, one of these  was up-regulated upwards of 340-fold.

secondary metabolic pathways such as the biosynthesis of farnesene , flavonoids , linalool, phenylpropanoids , chlorogenic acid , monoterpenes, simple coumarin, free phenylpropanoid acid and geranylgeranyldiphosphate  were significantly altered both 1 h and 24 h following ga <dig> treatment. within the farnesene biosynthetic pathway ,  <dig> genes encoding terpenoid synthases were highly up-regulated 1 h after ga <dig> treatment, while  <dig> genes encoding terpenoid synthases were down-regulated and three genes were up-regulated 24 h after treatment. in the case of flavonoid biosynthesis , genes encoding the key chalcone synthases displayed 22–66-fold increases in their expression 1 h after ga <dig> treatment, while 3-7-fold decreases were noted in their expression 24 h after treatment. differentially expressed genes encoding enzymes involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway, as well as the related chlorogenic acid biosynthetic pathway , included phenylalanine ammonia-lyases, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, 4-coumarate coa ligases, hydroxycinnamoyl-coa shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase, caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferases and cinnamoyl-coa reductases. interestingly, the majority of degs encoding pals, which are the enzymes that catalyze the first step in this biosynthetic pathway and also promote the synthesis of salicylic acid , were up-regulated following ga <dig> application .

among the sugar and polysaccharide-related pathways, homogalacturonan degradation , cellulose biosynthesis , starch degradation , dimboa-glucoside degradation, lactose degradation  and sucrose degradation  were represented. in particular, highly significant changes were observed in degs with involvement in homogalacturonan degradative and cellulose biosynthetic pathways .

in addition, the expression of genes within pathways related to the scavenging and detoxification of reactive oxygen species , including the 13-lox and 13-hpl pathway , glutathione-mediated detoxification  and removal of superoxide radicals , were also found to be significantly affected following ga <dig> treatment. degs within these pathways included lipoxygenases, peroxidases , glutathione s -transferase and superoxide dismutase.

discussion
gibberellins are involved in multiple aspects of growth and development, including stem elongation, seed maturation and germination, floral induction, pollen germination, and pollen tube growth  <cit> . in grapevine, the effects of ga application on berry enlargement, the induction of seedlessness in seeded cultivars and ripening have been the subject of study for quite some time  <cit> . interestingly, we have previously demonstrated that the exogenous pre-bloom application of ga <dig> inhibited berry growth in seeded ‘kyoho’ and ‘red globe’ cultivars, yet stimulated berry growth in ‘thompson seedless’  <cit> . similarly, it has also been shown that berry growth was inhibited in the seeded grape cultivar ‘emperador’ and promoted in the seedless cultivar ‘emperatriz’ upon ga <dig> application  <cit> . therefore, we supposed that whether the exogenous pre-bloom application of ga <dig> to grape inflorescences stimulates berry production may be cultivar-dependent. here, we confirm that the exogenous pre-bloom application of ga <dig> to ‘kyoho’ inflorescences promotes flower opening , fruit coloring , and seed abortion . to advance our understanding of these ga-induced responses in grape, we carried out rna-seq transcriptome analysis of grape flowers and compared results between ga3-treated and untreated samples.

in order to determine the appropriate time points following ga <dig> treatment at which our rna-seq analysis should be conducted, we assayed the gibberellin content in ga3-treated and untreated flowers and found that levels were elevated between 1 h and 24 h post-treatment, and then dropped 72 h following application . these results were consistent with previous findings in which ga <dig> application was found to substantially increase berry ga content for 24 h and then dropped to levels that were similar to untreated controls 3 days post-treatment  <cit> . it has been shown that the uptake percentage for ga <dig> was approximately  <dig> % 24 h after ga <dig> application  <cit> . therefore, we speculate that the observed increase in ga content in ga3-treated tissues stemmed from ga <dig> treatment. as a result of these findings, we collected our ga3-treated/untreated flower samples for rna isolation and subsequent transcriptome analysis 1 h and 24 h following treatment.

in each case, approximately 80% of the obtained reads could be assigned to grape genes and were used for gene expression profiling . the robustness of this rna-seq dataset was revealed by the high correlation observed among biological replicates , while the very close consistency between relative expression levels obtained with rna-seq and qrt-pcr  indicates the legitimacy of both sets of results. we detected  <dig> and  <dig> degs in grape flowers 1 h and 24 h following application with ga <dig>  respectively , indicating that the alterations in grape inflorescence morphology noted following ga <dig> treatment are likely mediated through modifications in genomic expression profiles. the multiplicity of go categories found to be enriched in ga3-treated tissues  hints at the complexity of the response.

in this study, at both 1 h and 24 h following ga <dig> treatment, up-regulated genes tended to fall into categories encompassing cellular, protein modification and catabolic processes, as well as multicellular organismal development and reproduction . furthermore, many post-ga <dig> treatment degs were found to be involved in various aspects of flower, fruit and embryonic development, as well as pollination and cell death . these processes correspond well with observed morphological alterations that occur following the application of ga <dig>  including the promotion of flower opening  and fruit coloring , as well as the induction of seed abortion . in addition, we identified many degs that are involved in various biochemical pathways, including those comprising the biosynthesis or degradation of diverse metabolites including hormones, sugars and polysaccharides, amino acids, fatty acids and lipids, and secondary metabolites . these findings imply that ga <dig> application to grape flowers has a fairly comprehensive impact on their metabolism.

plant hormones regulate essentially all physiological and developmental processes during a plant’s life cycle. these structurally diverse compounds include abscisic acid, auxins, brassinosteroids, cytokinins , gas, ethylene, and jasmonates   <cit> . in the present study, the expression of many genes involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, ethylene and gibberellin, as well as the degradation of cytokinins, were significantly altered following ga <dig> application . genes involved in jasmonic acid biosynthesis were up-regulated 1 h after ga <dig> treatment and down-regulated 24 h post-application . it has been found previously that ga promotes the expression of jasmonate  biosynthetic genes and induces ja accumulation in flowers  <cit> , which correlates well with our results. since it has been demonstrated that both ga and ja play important roles during stamen development  <cit> , it is possible that at least some aspects of the floral/reproductive alterations apparent in grape following ga <dig> application are the result of increased levels of ja. similarly, we found that five cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase  genes, which encode enzymes that are responsible for the breakdown of cytokinins  <cit> , were substantially up-regulated 24 h following ga <dig> application . since cytokinins play a role in gynoecia and fruit morphogenesis and patterning  <cit> , embryonic and post-embryonic growth and development  <cit> , and can also have an effect on seed number  <cit> , it is likely that a reduction in their levels would interfere with seed development, and thus may be involved in ga3-induced seedlessness .

conversely, we found that 24 h following ga <dig> treatment, several genes with involvement in ethylene biosynthesis  were down-regulated , which may result in a reduction in ethylene production flowers. intriguingly, ethylene plays important functions in tissue differentiation, initiation of flowering, anthocyanin synthesis, floral opening and senescence, pollination and fruit ripening  <cit> . in particular, ethylene is known to delay flowering by repressing ga levels  <cit> . therefore, it is feasible that ga3-induced premature floral opening may be related to the down-regulation of ethylene biosynthetic genes.

in terms of effects of ga <dig> application on the biosynthesis of this hormone itself, we found that the majority of ga20ox and ga3ox genes, which catalyze the penultimate and final steps, respectively, in the formation of bioactive gas   <cit> , were down-regulated following application of ga <dig> . in contrast, the genes encoding ga2ox  were up-regulated following ga treatment . both of these findings correspond well with previous studies  <cit> . these data suggest that feedback regulation may control the concentration of active gas after exogenous ga <dig> application, which could have an effect on the response of grape flowers to this hormone.

ga signaling is now understood to hinge on della proteins, which in the absence of ga negatively regulate ga response genes  <cit> . in the presence of ga, which binds to the gid <dig> receptor, interaction is enabled between gid <dig> and della proteins, which causes the subsequent degradation of the latter. it has been found previously that genes encoding ga receptors and della proteins were down-regulated and up-regulated, respectively, following ga treatment  <cit> , which agrees with our results .

in addition, we also found that  <dig>  and  <dig>  degs 1 h and 24 h after ga <dig> treatment, respectively, encoded transcription factors. members of the ap2/erebp transcription factor family made up the majority of these degs, followed by members of myb, bhlh, wrky, nac, and arf families . since transcription factors play essential roles in the regulatory networks of many developmental processes, it is probable that the alterations in their levels play a role in the observed morphological changes associated with ga <dig> application in grape.

interestingly, in this study, venn diagram analysis  displayed six simultaneously down-regulated genes at both 1 h and 24 h following ga <dig> application. one of these six genes that was very significantly down-regulated at both time points was a pelota gene , which was originally identified in drosophila melanogaster and is known to function in meiosis  <cit> . in mouse, it has been reported that disruption of the pelota gene causes early embryonic lethality and defects in cell cycle progression  <cit> , and in plants, a single homologue has been identified in arabidopsis  <cit> . due to its known role in meiosis, it is highly possible that reduction of pelota expression in grape could be related to ga3-induced seedlessness .

to further pinpoint particular genes that may play an important function in the response to exogenous ga <dig>  genes with a ≥ 10-fold change between treated and untreated samples, and relating to more than one biological process, were identified. interestingly, we found that genes encoding polygalacturonases  were substantially up-regulated in response to ga <dig> , with two of these  being up-regulated in excess of 230-fold. pg activity has been shown to be associated with organ abscission  <cit> , pod and anther dehiscence  <cit> , pollen grain maturation and pollen tube growth  <cit> . in grapevine, bloom coincides with the falling of cap structures, which are formed by the four petals detaching at the base of the flower to release the carpel and stamens. most notably, these up-regulated pgs genes in ga3-treated samples were found to be involved in both flower development and ripening biological processes. therefore, one may speculate that the genes encoding these significantly up-regulated pgs play a vital role in the ga3-induced opening of grape flowers and ripening of grape berries. it is possible to surmise that up-regulated pgs directly induced opening of grape ga3-treated flowers, and indirectly accelerated the maturation process in ga3-treated samples.

interestingly, we also demonstrated that genes encoding chalcone synthases, which are key enzymes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, were up-regulated 22-66-fold 1 h following ga <dig> treatment. in addition, two genes encoding flavanone 3-hydroxylases  were up-regulated 24 h after ga <dig> application . since flavonoids contribute to the pigmentation of many flowers and fruits  <cit> , it is possible to surmise that these particular genes might exert an important function in ga3-induced fruit coloring in grape .

similarly, we found that most of the degs encoding pals, which catalyze the first step in the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids, were up-regulated following ga <dig> application . the phenylpropanoid pathway has been shown to be coordinated in ripening fruit with the activity of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of flavonoids  <cit> , and many of the distinctive features of fleshy fruits, such as the appearance of characteristic color at ripening, are related to changes in the synthesis and accumulation of phenolic compounds  <cit> . moreover, salicylic acid , which can induce flowering, is known to be a downstream product of this pathway  <cit> . these results suggest that both the early opening of flowers and induction of fruit coloring in ga3-treated samples  might be triggered, at least in part, by the increased expression of pal genes and synthesis of sa.

it has been reported previously that the ga3-induced modulation of redox homeostasis may also play a role in seed abortion  <cit> . interestingly, in the present study, pathways including glutathione-mediated detoxification  and removal of superoxide radicals , which are both related to ros scavenging and detoxification, were significantly affected post-ga <dig> treatment. taken together, our findings lend credence to the proposition that ga3-induced morphological changes  comprise a very complex process, with changes in the expression of genes related to many aspects of plant development playing a role.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we demonstrated that the pre-bloom application of ga <dig> to ‘kyoho’ grapevine inflorescences promoted the opening of flowers and fruit coloring, and also induced seed abortion. furthermore, our comparison of the global expression profiles of ga <dig> treated and untreated grape flowers indicated that the ga response was complex, with alterations in the expression of genes involved in a large number of processes. these findings imply that ga3-induced changes in the morphology of grape inflorescences may be related to the regulation of hormone biosynthesis and signaling, the levels of various transcription factors, changes in secondary metabolites, and the stability of redox homeostasis. our results provide valuable information concerning genes and pathways that are differentially expressed during the early ga3-responsive phase , which will be useful for the further study of the ga <dig> response mechanism in grape.
