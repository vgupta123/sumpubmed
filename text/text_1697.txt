BACKGROUND
moth sexual communication has been a major research focus for understanding the evolution of prezygotic isolation  <cit> . this is because moth sexual communication is primarily chemical, and thus variation at the chemical level provides the basis for evolutionary change. the females produce and emit pheromone from a specialized structure, the sex pheromone gland  at the tip of their abdomen  <cit> , while the males perceive and respond to these pheromones from a distance  <cit> . since the first identification of the sex pheromone in bombyx mori  <cit> , sex pheromones and attractants of about  <dig>  moth species have been chemically identified  <cit> . most moth pheromone components are even-numbered c10-c <dig> straight-chain, unsaturated derivatives of fatty acids, with the carbonyl carbon modified to form an oxygen-containing functional group   <cit> . species-specificity of female pheromone blend production is the result of the combination of two or more compounds and the ratio between them. males also exhibit species-specificity in the behavioral attraction to this particular blend  <cit> .

the biosynthetic pathways of many sex pheromones have been partly elucidated  <cit> . free saturated fatty acids are produced de novo and converted to their acyl-coa thioesters before being incorporated into glycerolipids or converted to pheromone  <cit> . despite knowledge of the chemical intermediates, only a few enzymes in the biosynthetic pathways have been identified and characterized. most emphasis has been on the identification and characterization of desaturases, enzymes that introduce a double bond at a specific position in the carbon chain. so far Δ <dig>  Δ <dig>  Δ <dig>  Δ <dig> and Δ <dig> desaturases have been identified  <cit> . in addition, a fatty acid reductase has been identified in bombyx mori  <cit> . for understanding the evolution of moth sexual communication it is essential to know which genes are involved in the production of specific pheromone components and the variation in blend ratios.

the sex pheromone of heliothis virescens   is well-defined and consists of z11-16:ald as the major component, z9-14:ald as the secondary critical component, without which conspecific males are not attracted, and a few other minor components , the roles of which roles are less clear  <cit> . we recently found geographic as well as temporal variation in this pheromone blend  <cit> , which may be due to genetic variation.

the identification of genes that are expressed in the pheromone gland of h. virescens is not only useful for a fundamental understanding of moth sex pheromone evolution, but also from an applied perspective. heliothis virescens is a major agricultural pest in a number of crops in north and south america. pheromone traps are widely used in the us cotton belt to monitor h. virescens populations  <cit> , and in mexico  <cit> . the trap capture data have been used in many integrated pest management programs to determine if and when insecticide applications are needed. however, the extensive use of such traps may select for a shift in pheromone composition in local populations and thereby reduce trap efficiency  <cit> . identifying the genes causing variation in pheromone signals can aid in delaying or even circumventing such adaptation.

we have taken two complementary approaches to identifying moth pheromone genes. one starts with the phenomenology of pheromone differences between different species, and attempts to find the genes responsible for these. we have investigated the genetic basis of sex pheromone variation within and between two closely related moth species, h. virescens  and h. subflexa  using quantitative trait locus  analysis  <cit> . we found  <dig> qtl that explained a significant proportion of the variance of  <dig> pheromone components. by considering how each qtl affects the overall blend, we generated a list of candidate genes that may underlie these qtl by linking the genomic regions to the biosynthetic pathway of the different sex pheromone components of the two species  <cit> . we have illlustrated this approach in the context of a recent review of the predominant pathways of lepidoptera sex pheromone biosynthesis  <cit> .

the other approach to identifying genes controlling the chemical communication system of moths starts with a large set identified on the basis of expression in the pheromone gland, and attempts to narrow this down to subsets that could be directly involved in biosynthesis and emission of the blend. here we describe the construction and analysis of cdna libraries made from hv pg and associated tissues, which we compare to a) larval hv libraries to identify genes that do not have an exclusive pheromone function, and b) pg libraries from other moth species to identify genes that might. to illustrate the context of these comparisons, we provide a brief description of pg structure.

the pheromone gland is intimately associated with the ovipositor at the end of the adult female abdomen. the gland itself consists of a band-like single layer of epithelial cells that encircles the lower part of the eighth abdominal segment and the upper part of the ninth and last abdominal segment . these cells synthesize, store and release pheromone components in response to hormonal stimulation  <cit> . the outer surface of this band is covered with a thin cuticle densely packed with fine hairlike projections through which the pheromone is expelled  <cit> . the apical surfaces of the epithelial pg cells are elaborated into short microvilli pressing against the inner surface of this cuticle. when the abdomen is fully extended, the entire outer surface is exposed to the outside; when retracted, the layer is folded over itself and covered by the sclerotized upper half of the eighth abdominal segment  <cit> . the basal pg cell surfaces are underlain by a basement membrane separating the band of cells from the posterior end of the hemocoel cavity. encircled by and passing through the band of glandular cells are the oviduct and the posterior section of the digestive tract, sheathed in muscle and connective tissue. the sclerotized end of the ninth abdominal segment is the ovipositor, which surrounds the ovipore and the anus.

to identify genes that could be involved in pheromone biosynthesis, we constructed normalized and non-normalized cdna libraries of the pheromone gland plus ovipositor of h. virescens. in total we identified  <dig>  gene objects. comparing this database with a hv larval tissue library, we found  <dig>  gene objects that were unique to the pg libraries. we compared these to an est collection from agrotis segetum pg  <cit>  and to a set of unpublished pg sequences from bombyx mori deposited in genbank. with the characterization of > <dig> expressed gene objects and the comparisons between the different libraries, we can now list  <dig> candidate genes encoding classes of enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of moth sex pheromone production. in addition, in the pheromone gland we found evidence for  <dig> genes that might be involved in pheromone perception and degradation, and a surprisingly high number  of antimicrobial effector genes involved in immune defense.

RESULTS
overall description of the sequences
the average insert size of the cdnas of the hv pheromone gland library that were cloned and sequenced was  <dig>  bp, yielding a total of  <dig>  ests, which after assembly resulted in a total of  <dig>  contiguous sequences  and  <dig>  singletons represented by a single est . after normalization, an additional  <dig>  clones were sequenced, which resulted in an additional  <dig>  putative gene objects . combined, the non-normalized and normalized cdna library  resulted in a total of  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. these sequences were subjected to a protein translated blastx search and a gene ontology  analysis using blast2go  <cit> .  <dig>  sequences  matched described sequences in genbank . nearly half of the sequences  had no blast result , indicating a high number of lepidopteran or species-specific transcripts  <cit>  or long utrs without open reading frames. however, our method was based on directional cloning of full-length enriched cdnas and 5'end-sequencing of the cdnas. this strategy has potentially great advantages, as according to our findings, 5' utrs in moths are generally much shorter on average  than the 3' utrs. for the majority of ests for which we could not obtain any hits to genbank sequences we were still able to obtain open reading frames and interpro scan results.

*see text for explanation

the average insert size of the cdnas from mixed larval stages of h. virescens  was  <dig>  bp, similar to hvpg. the sequenced clones yielded a total of  <dig>  sequences, which assembled to a total of  <dig>  gene objects,  <dig>   of which were singletons. slightly more than half of these  showed a significant sequence similarity to sequences in the genbank nr protein database, while the remaining  <dig>  did not .

the most highly expressed genes in the non-normalized portion of hvpg encoded proteins involved in general cellular homeostasis, like cell cytoskeleton and cellular organization , muscle proteins , ribosomal proteins, and mitochondrial respiratory chain and atp synthase proteins . yet many of the top  <dig> highly expressed genes had no significant blast hit, which likely reflects the shallow genome coverage and annotation in the ncbi insecta database.

comparisons of cdna libraries
when we compared the est dataset of hvpg to the ests generated from hv larval tissue,  <dig>  of the  <dig>  sequences  were not found in hvln. we will refer to this dataset as hvpg_minus_hvln. of these  <dig>  sequences, only 41%  yielded high-score hits to public databases, while the majority  did not show any homology. the relatively high percentage of sequences with no significant homology to public databases indicates that many pheromone gland-specific genes have not been identified yet, similarly to what was found by strandh et al.  <cit>  in agrotis segetum.

strandh et al.  <cit>  constructed a cdna library from the pheromone gland of agrotis segetum and deposited  <dig> est sequences in genbank . assembling these sequences using the same procedure as described above resulted in a total of  <dig> contigs. we will refer to this dataset as aspg. a total of  <dig> sequence homologies  were found between this database and hvpg and bmpg .

from bombyx mori we assembled a collection of sequences that from  <dig>  ests that were deposited in genbank  and identified as originating from the pheromone gland of b. mori . assembling these sequences using the same procedure and threshold settings as for hvpg and hvln resulted in a total of  <dig>  gene objects,  <dig>   of which were singletons. for all gene objects that we describe here as candidate genes for pheromone biosynthesis, we deposited sequences in the tsa section of genbank . of this dataset, 69%  had homology to sequences in the public database . when comparing the sequences of bmpg with hvpg, we found homology between  <dig>  sequences  between the two datasets .

assignment of putative gene functions using gene ontology
for functional comparisons, all sequences were subjected to gene ontology  analysis in blast2go, where we classified all gene objects in biological function level  <dig> . to minimize the number of classes with only few gene objects, we set the minimum number of gene objects  in a class to 2% of the total number of sequences that could be classified. in this comparison aspg was excluded, because the aspg est dataset contained relatively few total sequences compared to hvpg, hvln, hvpg_minus_hvln, and bmpg.

of the  <dig>  sequences in the hvpg cdna library with matches in the genbank non-redundant  protein database,  <dig>   could be classified into go-level  <dig>  with each class containing at least  <dig> sequences . of the  <dig>  hvln sequences with high-score hits,  <dig>   were classified into go-level  <dig>  with at least  <dig> sequences in each class. of the  <dig>  hvpg_minus_hvln sequences,  <dig>   were classified into go-level  <dig>  the classes containing at least  <dig> sequences are shown in figure  <dig>  of the  <dig>  bmpg sequences that showed homology to genbank entries,  <dig>   were classified into go-level  <dig>  with each class containing at least  <dig> sequences.

the main contributor to the class of immune responses was the class of antimicrobial peptides . insects produce a variety of amps with antibacterial and antifungal activity, including the insect defensins, cecropins, attacin-like proteins, lysozyme and proline-rich peptides  <cit> . in the hvpg we have identified a large number of amps, among which the cecropin gene family , the gloverins  and the moricin-like sequences  are especially prominent . in addition to many newly identified amp genes, in our pheromone gland library we were also able to identify all of the published antibacterial and antifungal proteins from heliothis virescens, such as attacin  <cit> , heliomicin  <cit> , virescin , heliocin , lysozyme  <cit>  and several cecropins , -b , -c).

*identical to published heliothis virescens amps : cecropin-a , cecropin-b , cecropin-c , heliocin , virescin , lysozyme .

control of pheromone production and release
pheromone production in the pg is stimulated by pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide  that is released from the suboesophagal ganglion in the brain to the hemolymph, after which it binds to the pban receptor in the membrane of the pheromone gland  <cit> . the pban receptor in the pg has been characterized as a g-protein-coupled receptor in b. mori by hull et al.  <cit>   and cloned from h. virescens by kim et al.  <cit> . we found none of the three isoforms reported by that group  in hvpg. ez <dig>  occurring in hvpg but not hvln, shows homology to a g-protein coupled receptor but is more similar to the diapause hormone receptor of b. mori . ez <dig> corresponds to a g-protein gamma subunit homologue, also found by strandh et al. , which they hypothesized to interact with the pban receptor.

juvenile hormone has been shown to be an important regulator of pheromone induction in cockroaches  <cit> , and bark beetles  <cit> , but its role in the reproductive behavior in lepidoptera has not yet been clearly defined  <cit> . in some species it likely influences the circadian release of pban  <cit> , in others it may up-regulate the pban-receptor protein in the pheromone gland  <cit> . in hvpg  we found two jh binding proteins, ez <dig> and ez407196: the latter was also found in bmpg and aspg . finding these sequences specifically in the pheromone gland suggests that they may play a role in the binding of pban to its receptor  <cit> .

biosynthetic pathways of sex pheromone production
considering the putative biosynthetic pathways of sex pheromone production in moths , we identified  <dig> candidate genes from the hvpg library that are likely to play a role . each enzyme in this pathway is categorized  through  to facilitate the comparisons between table  <dig> figures  <dig> and  <dig>  genes that have not been specifically described as being part of the pathways so far, but which may also be involved, are categorized as x1-x <dig>  the list of contigs were compared against the other databases using reciprocal blast searches to identify which of the contigs are unique to hvpg , and/or are also found in bmpg andaspg .

*homologous sequences were found in strandh et al 

 acetyl coa carboxylase 
ez <dig> in hvpg matched sequences in the public database described as acetyl-coa carboxylase . this enzyme catalyzes the atp-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-coa to malonyl-coa in the rate-limiting step of long chain fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> . a search in ncbi for "acetyl coa carboxylase and lepidoptera" returned a sequence from heliothis virescens  which is identical to ez <dig>  this contig also showed high sequence similarity to accases described in other insects  and mammals. an alignment of the accase sequences from insects and vertebrates shows an overall very high sequence similarity . amino acid sequence identity between h. virescens and h. sapiens is 72%. accase  was not found in hvln; a similar sequence was present in bmpg, but not in the much smaller aspg.

 fatty acid synthase 
malonyl-coa, acetyl-coa, and nadph are utilized in fatty acid synthesis by the multifunctional enzyme fatty acid synthase . labeling studies with acetate demonstrated that the principal end products of fas in most lepidopteran pgs are palmitic acid  and stearic acid   <cit> . we found three contigs  that showed high sequence similarity with described insect fas in genbank  as well as fas of chicken and mus musculus. in addition, ez <dig> was described in blast2go as 'elongation of very long chain fatty acids' . all four contigs were absent from hvln. we did not find any significant hits of these four hvpg sequences to any of the bmpg or aspg ests using reciprocal blast searches, which again is most likely due to the lower number of transcripts identified in these libraries.

 desaturases 
in pheromone biosynthesis, double bonds are introduced into the fatty acid chain by a variety of desaturases, which have been classified into groups based on signature motifs, and extensively characterized biochemically  <cit> . two contigs were identified as putative Δ11-desaturase, while  <dig> were identified as putative Δ9-desaturases and ez <dig> was identified as a desaturase with the signature motif of vpae . it is not surprising to find a number of Δ9-desaturases, because they also occur commonly in animal and fungal tissues  <cit> . however, ez <dig> was the only Δ9-desaturase that was also found in the transcriptome of hvln, the other sequences were only found in hvpg. two groups of Δ9-desaturases have been identified and characterized in pheromone glands of moth species: one with a substrate preference of c <dig> > c <dig> , and the other with a substrate preference of c <dig> > c <dig>   <cit> . three contigs resembled predicted amino acid sequences of characterized desaturase genes displaying an npve signature motif, while the other  <dig> contigs resembled Δ9-desaturase sequences in other insects but did not contain the signature motif of either npve or kpse. specifically, ez <dig> and ez <dig> most closely resembled Δ9-desaturase in h. zea , ez <dig> mostly resembled the Δ9-desaturase of lampronia capitella , while ez <dig> mostly resembled Δ9-desaturase aaf <dig> of h. zea. one of the Δ11-desaturases  and one of the Δ9-desaturases  were found in bmpg and aspg as well and may thus be involved in the biosynthetic pathway of pheromone production in all of these species. for example, ez <dig> resembles a sequence from aspg , which was 84-fold upregulated compared to the as-body library  <cit> .

 fatty acyl reductase 
there is evidence for two routes of aldehyde pheromone biosynthesis in moths. the fatty acyl coa pheromone precursor may be reduced to the corresponding alcohol by an alcohol-generating fatty acyl reductase  and then oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde by an alcohol oxidase, i.e. dehydrogenase  <cit> . alternatively, fatty acyl coa may be reduced directly to aldehydes by aldehyde-generating fars. we found five contigs resembling far, only one of which  was also found in hvln . phylogenetic analysis of the far sequences identified in h. virescens and of a subset of fatty-acyl-reductases in lepidoptera and other insects  indicate that the h. virescens ez <dig> can be grouped with fars from pheromone glands of b. mori and ostrinia scapulalis. the alcohol-generating far from b. mori was shown by functional expression to produce the pheromone bombykol from its precursor  <cit> . the far-xiii gene of o. scapulalis was the only one of  <dig> specifically expressed in the pheromone gland  <cit> . ez <dig> is specifically expressed in the pheromone gland as well .

 aldehyde reductase and  alcohol oxidase 
whether aldehyde reductases first produce aldehydes which are then converted to alcohols, or vice versa, is very difficult to prove, because aldehyde reductases can also catalyze the reduction of the fatty aldehyde to the alcohol, so alcohols and not aldehydes are the major products  <cit> . the reverse reaction is catalyzed through alcohol oxidases, and both enzymes are more generally described as alcohol dehydrogenases. the systematic name of this group of enzymes is alcohol:nadp+ oxidoreductase, oxidizing alcohols using napd+  <=> aldehyde + nadph). some enzymes in this group oxidize only primary alcohols, while others act also on secondary alcohols. this group of enzymes may be identical to glucuronate reductase , mevaldate reductase  and lactaldehyde reductase . two contigs were named aldehyde reductase in blast2go, one of which  did not occur in the hvln transcriptome, while five contigs were named alcohol dehydrogenase, three of which were uniquely present in the hvpg transcriptome . none of these sequences were found in bmpg or aspg.

 acetyltransferase 
in general, synthesis of phospholipids can occur de novo or via remodeling of the existing phospholipids, and the biosynthesis of triglycerides  is an end product of these pathways  <cit> . in animals members of the 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate acyltransferase family  have been shown to transfer unsaturated fatty acyl groups. several agpats acylate lysophosphatidic acid  at the carbon- <dig> position to produce phosphatidic acid . these enzymes are involved in phospholipid and triglyceride synthesis through an evolutionary conserved process involving serial acylations of glycerol-3-phosphate . we found four distinct sequences similar to agpats, of which only one was also found in the transcriptome of hvln, whereas the others were only found in the hvpg library. one of the sequences that was present in hvpg but absent in hvln  was found in bmpg as well. in addition, three distinct putative acetyl-coa-acyltransferase sequences were found in hvpg, two of which were not found in hvln. this functional class of enzymes potentially converts fatty alcohols to acetate esters in pheromone glands and has been biochemically characterized in c. fumiferana  <cit>  and argyrotaenia velutinana  <cit> . remarkably, no acetyltransferase genes have been cloned from moth pheromone glands so far, although acetate esters are common pheromone components.

 acetate  esterase 
esterases are hydrolases, and hydrolysis of esters occurs during pheromone synthesis and degradation  <cit> . acetate esterases in pheromone glands have been shown to be active biochemically in c. fumiferana  <cit> , hydraecia micacea, h. virescens and h. subflexa  <cit> . in h. subflexa three acetates are components of the pheromone blend  <cit> , which render it unattractive to h. virescens males  <cit> . acetates have never been found in the pheromone gland of hv, and teal and tumlinson  <cit>  suggested that acetate esterase converts the acetates into alcohols as rapidly as they are produced in h. virescens, but not in h. subflexa. we found four esterases in hvpg, two of which were not found in hvln. all four contigs were also found in bmpg.

 lipase 
some of the fatty acids incorporated into pheromones may be liberated from pre-existing phospholipids and triglycerides by cleavage by lipases, to supplement fatty acid synthesis de novo  <cit> . most insect lipases fall into two categories, acidic  and neutral   <cit> . we found five neutral lipases , and five acidic lipases  in hvpg. horne et al.  <cit>  suggested that the lipase encoded by av <dig>  an est from b. mori pheromone gland was involved in liberation of fatty acids for pheromone precursors; this is most similar to our ez <dig> from hvpg.

 acyl-coa thioesterasesl long-chain fatty-acyl-coa hydrolase 
acyl-coa thioesterases  are a group of enzymes that hydrolyze coa esters to free coa and carboxylic acids. substrates can be a range of diverse molecules such as acyl-coas , coa esters of prostaglandins, bile acid coas etc. acyl-coa thioesterases have important functions in lipid metabolism and in regulating the levels of free coa and various coa esters in the cell, and have been found in the cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes  <cit>  the thioesterase sequences we identified were most similar to palmitoyl-protein thioesterase  and acyl-protein thioesterase . ez <dig> was not found in hvln, while ez <dig> was found in the hvln as well as in bmpg .

 aldehyde oxidase/dehydrogenase 
this group of enzymes catalyze the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids. therefore they may also be involved in the synthesis or degradation of pheromone compounds in the pheromone gland, specifically in the conversion of aldehydes to carboxylic acids  . a total of  <dig> distinct sequences that were categorized as aldehyde dehydrogenase were present in hvpg,  <dig> of which were not found in hvln. four of these sequences were also found in bmpg.

 short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase
the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases family  is a very large family of enzymes, most of which are known to be nad- dependent oxidoreductases. this superfamily consists of a phylogenetically related group of enzymes that act on substrates as diverse as steroids, fatty acids, sugars, aromatic hydrocarbons, antibiotics, and compounds involved in nitrogen metabolism  <cit> . the drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase belongs to this group of enzymes, and as it was the first member of this family to be characterized, the sdr family used to be called 'insect-type', or 'short-chain' alcohol dehydrogenases. since a number of dehydrogenases or reductases are likely to be involved in the moth pheromone biosynthetic pathway  we have included this generic group of enzymes in our list of candidate genes . we found a total of  <dig> distinct sequences in hvpg, two of which were not unique to this dataset, i.e. ez <dig> and ez <dig>  one of the sdr sequences, ez <dig>  was also found in bmpg.

 acyl-coa oxidase , acyl-coa dehydrogenase 
acyl-coa oxidases  and acyl-coa dehydrogenases  are involved in the pathway responsible for lipid catabolism and catalyse the first step in fatty acid β-oxidation by forming a trans-α,β double bond. apart from general lipid catabolism, acyl-coa oxidases are involved in a larger number of pathways and cellular processes, including the biosynthesis of plant hormones, the ppar signaling pathway, and also the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. we found in total five sequences resembling acyl-coa oxidase, four of which were present in hvpg but not in hvln . in addition, one mitochondrial acyl-coa dehydrogenase was found. since enzymes of the β-oxidation cycle act on coa derivatives with  <dig> to <dig> carbon chain length fatty acids, they may be active in pheromone production or degradation as well.

 enoyl-coa hydratase 
this enzyme carries out the second step in β-oxidation of fatty acids, the hydration of the trans-α,β double bond. two were found in hvpg, gu <dig> and gu <dig>  this enzyme activity is also represented by gu <dig>  corresponding to the α-subunit of the mitochondrial fatty-acid β-oxidation complex, which is a bifunctional protein also possessing 3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase activity.

 3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase 
this enzyme performs the third step in β-oxidation of fatty acids, the nad+ -dependent dehydrogenation of the β-hydroxyacyl coa to form the β-ketoacyl-coa. in hvpg this is represented by gu <dig>  and also by the bifunctional gu <dig> 

 enoyl-coa isomerase 
this enzme assists in the β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, transposing a c = c double bond so that subsequent steps of β-oxidation can be carried out. one representative, gu <dig>  was found in hvpg.

 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolase 
this enzyme performs the fourth and final step in the β-oxidation cycle, cleavage of a c-c bond to form acetyl-coa and a new acyl-coa with two fewer carbon atoms than the previous one. four representatives, including one corresponding to the β-subunit of the mitochondrial fatty-acid β-oxidation complex , were found in hvpg.

strandh et al.  <cit>  also described a number of sequences in the agrotis segetum pheromone gland est library that were considered as candidate genes putatively involved in pheromone production . based on the similarity in gene descriptions of homologous sequences  found in genbank, ten of these were potentially similar to sequences we have identified in the heliothis libraries. to determine whether these sequences overlapping by their gene descriptions are indeed the same, we downloaded their candidate gene sequence files from genbank and compared them with sequences from our libraries using seqtools  <dig> . <dig> . two desaturase contigs in aspg were also present in hvpg . also, the aspgcontig that showed homology to "acyl-coa binding protein homologue"  was found in hvpg , as well as the jh binding protein  which was homologous to ez <dig>  the other contigs with homologies to enoyl coa hydratase  and "similar to acetyl coa acetyltransferase precursor"  were not found in hvpg.

*homologous sequences were found in strandh et al 

pheromone perception and degradation
candidates involved in pheromone perception and/or degradation include odorant binding proteins obps), chemosensory proteins , pheromone binding proteins , antennal binding proteins , chemosensory receptors, and odorant degrading enzymes . most of these have been identified in antennae of adult males  <cit> . in many insect species, obps are a diverse gene family that encode proteins thought to function as molecular chaperones by binding pheromones and semiochemicals and transporting them through the aqueous lymph of insect sensilla to the olfactory receptors . compared with obps, csps are expressed more broadly in various insect tissues. in the silkworm bombyx mori, the obps are subdivided into three main subfamilies; pheromone-binding proteins , general odorant-binding proteins  and antennal-binding proteins   <cit> .

detailed anatomical studies of moth pheromone glands have not revealed similar sensory structures  <cit> . however, recently widmayer et al.  <cit>  detected the pheromone receptors hr <dig>  hr <dig> and hr <dig> by rt-pcr in tissue consisting of the ovipositor tip and the pg. they subsequently identified a few sensillae expressing one of these pheromone receptors on the ovipositor, i.e. the sclerotized cuticle on the lateral lobes of the tip of the ninth abdominal segment. these pheromone receptors, as well as the pheromone binding proteins  found by widmayer et al.  <cit>  were not present in hvpg. however, we could find these products after amplification with the gene-specific primers .

the odorant binding proteins that we did find in hvpg, all were present in hvpg and absent in hvln, indicating that these proteins are pheromone gland specific as well. one of these sequences coding for odorant binding proteins was also found in bmpg . another major group of genes that we found in the pheromone gland library were  <dig> sequences that were listed as chemosensory proteins. of the chemosensory proteins that we found in hvpg, only two also occurred in hvln, one of which was found in bmpg  and one in aspg . of the  <dig> chemosensory proteins that were only found in hvpg and not in hvln, one was found in bmpg , while ez <dig> and ez <dig> were also present in agpg.

discussion
our strategy of analyzing both non-normalized and normalized libraries of the same tissues allowed us to combine advantages of both; frequency counts of the most abundant transcripts in the former provided a "digital northern", and reduction of these in the latter greatly increased the discovery rate of genes with lower expression levels.

the normalization resulted in the reduction of many over-abundant transcripts detected as strong bands in the non-normalized total cdna, thus drastically increasing the number of new gene objects identified per sequencing run. the sequencing and assembly into  <dig> contigs from the sex pheromone gland of h. virescens has revealed that this tissue is more complex than we envisioned beforehand. this is likely at least partly due to the fact that the pheromone gland tissue is intimately associated with the ovipositor, the oviduct and the last part of the digestive tract, as described in detail in the introduction.

the main objective of this study was to identify a list of candidate genes that are likely to be involved in the biosynthetic pathway of moth sex pheromone production. by comparing our extensive database of the pheromone gland transcriptome of h. virescens to that of all  <dig>  sequences identified from larval tissues of the same moth, as well as to the sequences identified from the pheromone gland of b. mori and a. segetum, we identified a total of  <dig> candidate genes that included all enzyme categories that have been biochemically found to be involved in the biosynthetic pathway of sex pheromone production in moths  <cit>  . the fact that we found relatively few overlapping sequences in the different pheromone gland databases may either be due to unsaturated coverage or to highly diverged gene expression patterns between species leading to the species-specific pheromone blends.

the finding of a sequence homologous to the pban receptor in hvpg as well as in hvln support the finding of rafaeli et al.  <cit>  who found the pban receptor in h. armigera also to be present in the brain, thoracic ganglion and ventral nerve cord, i.e. in neural tissues, suggesting that these receptors may represent a neurotransmitter-like function  <cit> . the fact that we and strandh et al.  <cit>  found an unrelated g-protein coupled receptor indicates that additional receptors are present in the pheromone gland and/or ovipositor than just the pban receptor.

even though the enzymes that are possibly involved in the biosynthetic pathway of pheromone production do not necessarily have to be only present or active in the pheromone gland, if we assume that the contigs that are specifically found in hvpg and not in hvln are more likely to be candidate genes for this pathway than contigs that were found in both datasets, then ez <dig> is the most likely candidate involved in pheromone production in hv. this is because a) it is mostly expressed in the pheromone gland in comparison to the body , and b) it is the far that most closely resembles the far of b. mori that has been found to be involved in the biosynthetic pathway  <cit>  as well as the farxiii of ostrinia scapulalis that that was exclusively expressed in the pheromone gland  <cit>  .

as for the desaturases, in addition to the clearly defined Δ9- and Δ11-desaturases that we found in the pheromone gland transcriptome, we also identified a contig that mostly resembled a desaturase that has been named vpae, after its signature motif  <cit> . even though no function has been determined for this desaturase or others with the signature motif gatd, qpge, and kpve, they are also regularly found in sex pheromone glands, and codon-based likelihood analyses indicate strong purifying selection, so that these lineages are most likely protein coding and functional as well  <cit> .

having identified candidate genes of all categories that have been biochemically shown to be involved in the biosynthetic pathway of moth pheromone production opens the possibility to characterize more enzymes than only desaturases and fatty acyl reductases, which will certainly increase our understanding of how sex pheromones may evolve. especially the acetate esterases are most likely to be found in pheromone glands of many moth species, as a large number of species have acetate esters as pheromone components. identification of variation in this enzyme may shed light on the diversification of pheromone components in the different species. the molecular characterization of the additional enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of moth pheromone production can also help to elucidate specific paths in the biosynthetic pathway. for example, the question of whether aldehyde reductases first produce aldehydes which are then converted to alcohols, or vice versa, may be solved by knocking down specific aldehyde reductases.

the diversity of antimicrobial peptides  identified in the pheromone gland library of heliothis virescens is both impressive and surprising . since the first discovery of amps in insects  <cit> , several hundred of these peptides with antifungal and/or antibacterial activity have been identified from diverse insects and many vertebrates. however, the in vivo function in insects of most members of this large and very diverse group of proteins still remains unclear. although they lack an adaptive immune system, insects possess an innate immune system that recognizes and destroys intruding microorganisms. parasites and pathogens can represent extremely powerful selective forces because of their ability to evolve rapidly. the resulting diversity of infectious agents and host immune-suppressive factors exerts strong selection pressures and favors hosts with a large repertoire of defense responses, including effector molecules with direct defense activity, among which amps and peptide families such as the defensins are prominent  <cit> .

the identification of the vast amounts of amps in the heliothis virescens pheromone gland and associated tissue is even more surprising given that shelby et al.  <cit>  have only identified a single amp-like transcript in a survey of the immune-induced hemocyte transcriptome of h. virescens, despite the bacterial elicitation of the hemocytes in the construction of the cdna library. however, the majority of amps circulating in the larval hemolymph seems to be produced in the fat body and other tissues, and not in the hemocytes themselves. in our pheromone gland library we have not only identified all of the published antibacterial and antifungal proteins from heliothis, such as attacin  <cit> , heliomicin  <cit> , and lysozyme  <cit>  but also a wide range of additional amps from these and other gene families, including a large variety of gloverins and cecropins . possibly, this large variety is due to the fact that the gland is everted with the ovipositor to the outside when a female moth is calling, and thus exposed to the external environment.

the sequences found in bombyx mori pheromone gland contained a much smaller number of gene objects that were classified as immune defense-related. this may be due to the fact that we extracted rna from the gland with the ovipositor, similar to the procedure of strandh et al.  <cit> , as the pheromone gland is tightly connected and completely surrounding the ovipositor in hv  <cit> . since the pheromone gland of b. mori is much bigger, it is possible to dissect the gland from the ovipositor and care was taken to extract from the pheromone gland only . however, the much smaller number of immune defense gene objects in b. mori may also reflect the fact that this moth is the oldest domesticated animal , with one of the result being that adults are no longer able to fly. probably under these domesticated conditions the environmental pathogen pressure against which the gland should be defended is absent as well, which may have caused the immune defense and immune response genes to be either not expressed or at a much lower level and with less complexity. an alternative explanation would be that in b. mori the steady-state level of immune defense is much lower as compared to non-domesticated lepidopteran species. the steady-state immune defense levels in response to even non-pathogenic bacteria-feeding in larvae of herbivorous lepidoptera has recently been shown to be higher than expected  <cit> . in the flesh fly, sarcophaga peregrina, it was observed that mrna of antibacterial genes accumulated even in naïve insects during different developmental stages  <cit> .

lastly, finding a total of  <dig> sequences that are likely to be involved in pheromone perception  strongly suggests that females may perceive pheromone compounds via their ovipositor and/or pheromone gland. having chemical and/or pheromone receptors on and near the pheromone gland suggests that there may be a feedback loop of the chemosensory environment and the pheromone production  <cit> . preliminary studies on phenotypic plasticity in the pheromone production of the closely related moth species h. subflexa indeed suggest that the pheromone composition differs depending on the environment in where the females developed .

CONCLUSIONS
we have generated an extensive list of candidate genes that may be involved in the pheromone biosynthesis, perception and/or degradation and which occur specifically in female sex pheromone glands. subsequent evaluation of these candidates will follow two independent approaches. a correlation with active pheromone biosynthesis will be tested by determining which of these genes are differentially up- or downregulated in pheromone glands that are actively producing pheromone , and  <dig> glands were dissected from females that had been injected with pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide  1- <dig> hours prior to extraction . in summary, a stock solution of hez-pban   was diluted in saline  to  <dig>  pmol/μl. females were injected during the photophase with  <dig>  pmol pban in  <dig> μl, using a  <dig> μl syringe  with a  <dig> gauge needle that was inserted ventrally between the 8th and the 9th abdominal segments. one-two hr after injection, the pheromone glands were dissected , placed immediately in trizol and frozen to -80°c before homogenization and total rna extraction. as can be seen in figure  <dig>  the complete intact gland was used for rna extraction, which included the ovipositor, muscle tissue, the anus and the last part of the digestive tract  <cit> . we chose to leave the gland intact because in hv pheromone is only found in extracts with intact glands .

rna extractions
trizol reagent  was used to isolate the rna according to the manufacturer's protocol with several modifications. the rna was precipitated overnight at -20°c and the dried pellet was dissolved in  <dig> μl rna storage solution . an additional dnase  treatment was included prior to the second purification step to eliminate any contaminating dna. the dnase enzyme was removed and the rna was further purified by using the rneasy minelute clean up kit  following the manufacturer's protocol and eluted in  <dig> μl of rna storage solution . rna integrity and quantity was verified on an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer using the rna nano chips . rna quantity was determined on a nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer. rna extractions were generated and four extracts were pooled to maximize the possible number of gene objects to be found and minimize unique contigs.

construction of the cdna library
for both the heliothis virescens mixed larval stages  and treatments  and the pheromone gland tissue material a full-length enriched, directionally cloned, normalized cdna library was generated using a combination of the smart cdna library construction kit  and the trimmer direct cdna normalization kit  generally following the manufacturer's protocol but with several important modifications. in brief,  <dig> μg of total rna was used for each cdna library generated. reverse transcription was performed with a mixture of several reverse transcription enzymes  for  <dig> h at 42°c and  <dig> minutes at 50°c. each step of the normalization procedure was carefully monitored to avoid the generation of artifacts and overcycling. the optimal condition for ds-cdna synthesis was empirically determined by subjecting the cdna to a range of thermocycle numbers and their products checked by electrophoresis. the optimal cycle number  was defined as the maximum number of pcr cycles without any signs of overcycling.

to detect and classify both highly abundant transcripts and to generate a more complete transcriptome map of the gland, we generated and sequenced both a non-normalized and a normalized cdna library of the pheromone glands of heliothis virescens. an additional non-normalized cdna library was generated for the heliothis virescens pheromone gland tissue by primer extension with the mint cdna synthesis kit  according to the manufacturer's protocol. in order to compare the pheromone gland sequences to another tissue from the same species, we also generated a normalized cdna library from larval tissue, essentially as described above for the h. virescens pheromone gland library.

each of the resulting ds-cdna pools for the different cdna libraries was purified and concentrated using the dna clean and concentrator kit  and size fractionated with sizesep  <dig> spun columns  that resulted in a cutoff at ~ <dig> bp. the full-length-enriched cdnas were cut with sfii and ligated to pdnr-lib plasmid . ligations were transformed into e. coli electromax dh5α-e electro-competent cells .

sequencing, generation of est databases and sequence analysis
plasmid minipreparation from bacterial colonies grown in  <dig> deep-well plates was performed using the  <dig> well robot plasmid isolation kit  on a tecan evo freedom  <dig> robotic platform . single-pass sequencing of the 5' termini of cdna libraries was carried out on an abi  <dig> × l automatic dna sequencer . vector clipping, quality trimming and sequence assembly using stringent conditions  was done with the lasergene software package .

in order to obtain a rough transcriptome coverage estimate for the pheromone gland library, we went through a series of search steps in order to i) obtain all hits against the conserved kegg pathway database, and ii) estimate genome coverage by identifying the complete ribosomal protein dataset as compared to the full bombyx mori set. based on these findings we estimate the theoretical transcriptome coverage to be ~85% .

we set up individual searchable databases for each of the species and used them to identify the genes we describe in more detail in the text. blast searches were conducted on a local server using the national center for biotechnology information  blastall program. homology and gene ontology , enzyme classification codes  and metabolic pathway analysis of the assembled sequences were determined using the blast2go software . sequences were searched against the ncbi non-redundant  protein database using an e-value cut-off of 10- <dig>  with predicted polypeptides of a minimum length of  <dig> amino acids.

nucleotide sequences were analyzed using the commercial lasergene software package and the freeware bioedit program. all est sequences were submitted to genbank . genes were aligned by their amino acid sequences using the clustalw function  <cit> . if necessary, alignments were then corrected by eye before being used for the contig and gene family analysis as well as the phylogenetic analyses.

to prepare annotated sequences for submission to genbank, two strategies were used to remove redundant contigs in each library. first, protein translations of the contigs in each category were compared using the multiple alignment program mafft http://align.bmr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mafft/online/server/; this identified many contigs with predicted protein sequences that were >95% identical. second, nucleotide consensus sequences of all  <dig> contigs were subjected to two additional rounds of clustering using the program sequencher . the first round grouped sequences with >85% identity over at least  <dig> nt using the "clean data" option, and the second round used the same parameters with the "dirty data" option. the new clusters were examined by eye and those with <95% identity over at least  <dig> nt were split again.  <dig> of the original contig consensus sequences were not further grouped by this procedure; the remaining  <dig> consensus sequences were grouped into  <dig> groups. all contigs combined by the mafft alignment were also combined by sequencher. assembled contigs were submitted to the tsa section of genbank . additional sequences of individual clones for enzymes participating in the β-oxidation of fatty acids were deposited in genbank .

phylogenetic reconstruction
the phylogenetic reconstruction implemented for the analysis of several proteins was performed using the neighbour-joining  method . far and accase amino acid sequences were aligned by mafft http://align.bmr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mafft/software/ and each visually inspected for regions of high quality alignment. the nj consensus tree was generated with treecon. distance calculations were performed after tajima & nei and bootstrap analysis, running  <dig> bootstrap samples  <cit> . conserved residues in the alignments were highlighted with boxshade  <dig>  http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/box_form.html.

bombyx mori and agrotis segetum pheromone gland ests
all of the available bombyx mori pheromone gland library ests from genbank  and from the agrotis segetum pheromone gland library ests  were assembled with the same parameters as the heliothis virescens ests to avoid any bias in subsequent data analysis.

best bidirectional hits and non-overlapping contigs
to identify best bidirectional hits between two sets of ests reciprocal tblastx wu-blast analyses were performed. custom perl scripts then searched the blast output to find all cases where query "x" gave best hit "y" and query "y" gave best hit "x" . for all of the inter-species comparisons  the vals value was  <dig>  perl scripts also identified hvpg ests that had no best bidirectional hit in hvln .
