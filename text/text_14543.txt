BACKGROUND
micrornas  are an abundant class of endogenous, non-coding, short transcripts that play important regulatory roles in plants and animals  <cit> . they often occur in large gene families conserved between distantly related species  <cit> . approximately  <dig> families of plant mirnas are moderately to highly conserved and nearly as many fall into the lowly conserved category  <cit> . in addition, there are many lineage- and species-specific mirna families  <cit> .

in plants, mirnas repress gene expression by pairing with near-perfect complementary sequences primarily in the mrna coding region to guide cleavage and translational repression  <cit> . the majority of known plant mirna targets encode developmentally important transcription factors  <cit>  or other regulatory and stress-response proteins  <cit> . mutants impaired in mirna biogenesis exhibit severe abnormalities, and plants ectopically expressing particular mirnas or mirna-resistant versions of their targets exhibit a wide range of phenotypes  <cit> .

plant mirnas have been detected in a range of organs and tissues of model plants and crop species and often show differential expression among different tissues  <cit> . in addition, mirnas were detected in the phloem sap of cucurbits  <cit> , lupin  <cit>  and oilseed rape  <cit> . the role of phloem mirnas is not yet clear. while some mirnas have demonstrated cell-autonomous expression and effects  <cit> , mirnas in the phloem may have a role in establishing gradients of gene expression necessary for developmental patterning and stress responses  <cit> . at least one phloem mirna has a demonstrated long-distance signalling role in the regulation of the plant nutrient status  <cit> . identification and characterization of mirnas in both tissues and the phloem sap thus becomes an important step in developing a complete understanding of the regulation of transcription factors and other key regulatory and stress-response genes.

one of the difficulties of studying the long-distance signalling in plants is access to a true representation of phloem cell contents. various methods have been used in the past to collect exudate from woody and herbaceous plants. the most common method has been to collect exudate from incisions in the bark of woody plants  <cit>  or to cut stems or petioles of herbaceous plants that lack the typical rapid response to vascular damage  <cit> . these exudation methods allow the collection of samples enriched for the sieve element  contents; however, there is a high likelihood of contamination with the contents of other cells that are damaged by cutting. in addition to contamination from other cells, incision in the vasculature leads to a rapid fall of turgor pressure, a decrease in local water potential, an influx of water, and dilution of the exudate  <cit> . the decreased water potential may also cause solute influx from associated cells, such as companion cells and neighbouring phloem parenchyma cells. finally, rapid changes in pressure may result in release of the se structural components that are otherwise not translocated in the intact vasculature. the standard practice to minimise contamination is to discard the first drop of exudate from a vascular incision, which will reduce but not completely eliminate the contamination from damaged cells  <cit> . in contrast to exudation methods that are prone to contamination, phloem-feeding insects, such as aphids, enable sampling of se sap that is often referred to as the gold standard for phloem, being purest and least subject to sampling artefacts. aphid stylectomy has been used to detect and characterise proteins and to detect specific mrnas in the ses of various plant species  <cit> . because of the size of the aphid stylet, there is no major change in the pressure and water potential, which in turn minimises water and solute fluxes that are inevitable with incision-based sampling.

the aim of this study was to characterise mirnas from apple  and to determine which mirnas potentially translocate over long distances in apple sieve tubes. to date, only a handful of apple mirnas have been identified and their expression in different apple tissues validated  <cit> . in this study, we validate expression in apple tissues for eighteen out of twenty-one tested mirna sequences, some of them shown to be conserved between various plant species  <cit> . in addition, we test for the presence of mirnas in the apple se sap obtained by aphid stylectomy and confirm the presence of a subset of mirnas in the apple phloem translocation stream. further, we analyse expression of potential targets for apple mirnas.

RESULTS
conserved mirnas are differentially expressed in apple tissues
to establish that the majority of conserved mirnas are expressed in apple, eighteen mirnas previously detected in a number of species including arabidopsis, rice  and poplar , one detected in arabidopsis and poplar but not in rice, and two that were reported to be specific for poplar, were chosen for expression analysis in apple tissues  <cit>  . some mirnas chosen for this study occur in large gene families with identical and nearly identical sequences. nearly identical mirna sequences are given the appropriate mirna number and a letter suffix that distinguishes between sequences with slight differences  <cit> . for practical reasons, mirna sequences with letter suffix 'a' were chosen. these are often the most conserved and most abundant sequences within the mirna family that were identified in early and relatively small-scale sequencing projects. rna gel-blot analysis was used to examine the expression of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> in shoot apex, leaf and stem tissues. positive signals of expression were detected for most of these mirnas in either some or all of the tissues . the relative levels of expression were higher for mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> than for mir <dig> and especially mir <dig>  which was barely detectable. mir <dig> and mir <dig> were expressed in all tissues tested, with mir <dig> expressed to similar levels in all tissues, while mir <dig> levels were somewhat lower in xylem than in other tissues tested. high levels of mir <dig> expression were detected in the shoot apex and periderm and low levels of expression were detected in leaf, stem and phloem; mir <dig> was not detected in the xylem. mir <dig> was highly expressed in the shoot apex and leaf, had low levels of expression in the stem, periderm and xylem and was not detected in the phloem tissue. to establish that stem-loop reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  can be confidently used instead of gel-blot analysis, the expression of the same subset of mirnas was examined using reactions carried out in a semi-quantitative manner . the results were comparable to those obtained by rna gel-blot analysis. increased sensitivity of this method allowed for detection of low levels of mir <dig> expression across all tissues analysed. this method confirmed high mir <dig> expression in periderm, but could not detect any mir <dig> expression in the xylem tissue, even when the number of pcr cycles was increased from  <dig> to  <dig> . further, the stem-loop rt-pcr expression analysis was extended to a larger subset of conserved and poplar-specific mirnas . the number of amplification cycles performed ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  in order to maintain the semi-quantitative nature of pcr but minimise non-specific amplification. all conserved mirnas with the exception of mir <dig> were detectable in some or all examined apple tissues with up to  <dig> cycles of pcr. at this number of cycles, no amplification or a weak band of primer-dimers was obtained in minus-rt control and water control reactions . mir <dig> and mir <dig> could not be detected in any of the apple tissues. several mirnas were expressed to similar levels in all tissues tested, e.g. mir <dig> was highly expressed in all tissues and mir <dig> showed moderate to low levels of expression in all tissues; mir <dig> and mir <dig> were barely detectable in the shoot apex, whereas mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were more abundant in the shoot apex than other tissues; mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> appeared up-regulated in leaf. several mirnas were differentially expressed across the stem tissues: mir <dig> showed higher expression in the phloem than xylem and was barely detectable in periderm; mir <dig> showed higher expression in the xylem than phloem and was barely detectable in periderm; mir <dig> was more abundant in periderm than phloem and xylem; mir <dig> was absent from phloem but was detected both in periderm and xylem.

some apple mirnas are abundant in the phloem tissue
periderm, phloem and xylem tissues used for rt-pcr were obtained by peeling the layers of the stem and therefore might contain contamination from adjacent cell layers. to distinguish between cell layers, spatial expression of a subset of mirnas was further analysed using in situ hybridisation. antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to mir <dig> and mir <dig> but not mir <dig> produced a hybridization signal in the phloem of apple seedling stems . some expression could also be detected around the xylem. to address the universality of phloem-associated expression across species, arabidopsis stems were analysed by in situ hybridization. similar phloem expression for the same subset of mirnas was detected in the arabidopsis inflorescence stem. both mir <dig> and mir <dig> antisense probes produced a strong hybridization signal in the phloem , while no signal was detected with mir <dig> antisense oligonucleotide probe , consistent with the rt-pcr results. in addition, no signal could be detected using corresponding sense probes .

apple phloem sap obtained by aphid stylectomy contains small rna
small rnas, including short interfering rnas  and mirnas, were previously detected in the phloem sap of herbaceous species obtained by exudation methods. to establish if small rnas are present in the phloem sap of woody perennials, woolly apple aphid stylectomy was used to obtain the apple se content. woolly apple aphids feed by inserting their stylets into the phloem tissue and sucking up the sap . rna isolated from an se sample collected from a single aphid was radioactively labelled and visualised after separation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . a small quantity of high molecular weight rna remained close to the well of the gel and a strong band of small rna  was detected in the low molecular weight fraction .

mirnas were detected in apple phloem sap
to establish which mirnas are present in apple phloem translocation stream, rna purified from the sap derived by aphid stylectomy was used as a template in stem-loop rt-pcr analysis. because of the very small amounts of sap collected , each rt reaction was performed once per sap collection and repeated two more times for a subset of ten mirnas using rna from different sap samples as template. the results between these biological replicates were reproducible. using this approach mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were clearly detectable; mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> produced a weak amplification signal; mir <dig> and mir <dig> amplification did not produce the expected product, but resulted in a smear not detected in the minus-rt control; mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and the mirnas specific to poplar  were not detected . the summary of mirnas expressed in apple and detected in apple phloem tissue and apple phloem sap is presented in table  <dig> 

n.d., not detected; n.d.*, no clear amplification product present

the majority of mirnas detected in the apple se sample were previously found in phloem sap samples of herbaceous species, but some mirnas detected in the phloem sap of herbaceous species were not detected in apple phloem sap . this might be the result of contamination during exudation sampling used for herbaceous plants, which is more likely to occur with mirnas highly abundant in the vascular tissue. to establish the ratio of mirna accumulation in the phloem sap and vascular tissue, stem-loop rt-pcr expression analysis was performed using rna purified from pumpkin vascular bundle tissue and phloem sap obtained by the exudation method. a large proportion of mirnas detected in apple phloem sap were also present in pumpkin phloem sap at significantly higher levels than in the vascular bundles. in contrast, mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  which were absent from apple phloem sap, were detected in pumpkin phloem sap at a lower level than in the pumpkin vascular bundle. mir <dig> and mir <dig> were not detected in the apple se sample but were enriched in the pumpkin phloem sap sample .

identification of potential apple mirna targets
the majority of mirna molecules chosen for this study and the complementary sites within their mrna targets display a high degree of conservation between species  <cit> . thus, the apple expressed sequence tag  database was interrogated for the presence of putative mirna targets. gleave et al.  <cit>  previously reported putative orthologues of spl encoding genes as apple mir <dig> targets, an apple arf <dig> as a mir <dig> target, orthologues of ap <dig> and toe <dig> as mir <dig> targets and a copper superoxid dismutase, mdcsd as a mir <dig> target. in addition to these sequences, putative orthologues of class iii hd zip transcription factor family were identified from the malus est database and named mdphv, mdrev, mdhb <dig>  and mdhb <dig> . the mir <dig> target sites are identical between apple and arabidopsis orthologous genes  and are highly conserved within plants, with only two nucleotide differences within the whole gene family. further, a putative orthologue of arabidopsis f-box protein that contains a conserved mir <dig> target site was identified and named mdf- box <dig>  the arabidopsis f-box and mdf-box <dig> transcripts share the predicted mir <dig> complementary site that is almost a perfect reverse complement of mir <dig> . a candidate for apple auxin response factor was also identified and named mdarf <dig>  while it seems more closely related to arabidopsis arf <dig> and arf <dig> proteins , the mir <dig> complementary site is identical to that of arabidopsis arf <dig> transcript and is a perfect reverse complement of mir <dig> with a single g/u pair . an apple nac-domain protein coding sequence mdnac <dig> was identified as a potential mir <dig> target, the complementary site having three mismatches and two g/u pairs . the list of apple mirna target genes analysed in this study with their accession numbers is presented in additional file  <dig> 

expression of mirnas and corresponding target mrnas
to establish the correlation between expression of apple mirnas and their corresponding targets, rt-pcr and stem-loop rt-pcr were performed using stem tissue rna. expression of mirnas that degrade their target mrnas shows negative correlation with the respective target mrnas; they are expressed in adjacent spatial domains and the role of mirnas is to clear cells of their target gene activities  <cit>  and to maintain sharp gene expression boundaries. positive correlation is also observed for some mirnas and a quantitative role for mirnas was proposed in the reduction of the target mrna accumulation in cells and tissues that co-express both  <cit> . accumulation that was over five fold different between tissues was detected for mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  including total absence of mir <dig> from xylem. accumulation of their targets was either not detected in case of mir <dig>  or opposite to that of their corresponding mirnas, with undetectable or barely detectable accumulation of the target in the tissue with the highest mirna accumulation . differential accumulation of mirna was detected among tissues for mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> and their respective predicted targets mdarf <dig>  mdarf <dig> and mdcsd, but the target fold change was low . accumulation of mdspl target transcripts varied among tissues and was not obviously related to differential accumulation of mir <dig>  as was the case for mir <dig> and mdtoe <dig> .

discussion
evolutionary conservation of mirnas in apple
mature mirnas previously detected in arabidopsis, poplar and rice were also detected in apple tissues, with the exception of mir <dig>  the absence of mir <dig> detection in this study may be due to the limited set of vegetative tissues used, or growth conditions that prevent mir <dig> accumulation, such as ample copper supply  <cit> . it is also possible that the apple variant of mir <dig> has several mismatches to the mir397a sequence chosen for this study and was therefore more difficult to detect using the stem-loop rt-pcr method. interestingly, the precursor for this sequence could not be identified in the malus est dataset  <cit> . a mature mir <dig>  previously detected in arabidopsis and poplar but not in rice, was detected in apple shoot tip, leaf and all stem tissues, confirming conservation between rosales and brassicales orders within the rosid eudicot clade and suggesting that mir <dig> evolved more recently, after the divergence of monocots and dicots.

previously described mir <dig> and mir <dig> were identified in poplar as mirnas targeting members of the ppr family and potentially implicated in tree-specific mirna functions  <cit> . these sequences were not detected in apple stem tissues, suggesting that these mirnas evolved quite recently, after the divergence of malpighiales and rosales orders within the rosid clade. indeed, only four similar sequences for mir <dig> and three similar sequences for mir <dig> can be found in the mirbase database  <cit> , and they are all identified in poplar. alternatively, it is possible that the expression of these mirnas commences in older plants, after substantial secondary growth.

phloem tissue and phloem sap are highly enriched for specific mirnas
of eighteen mirna sequences detected in at least one of the analysed apple tissues, all except mir <dig> were detected in the phloem tissue. almost half could be detected with fewer than  <dig> cycles of pcr, suggesting they were relatively abundant in that tissue. these high expression levels are likely to be the result of the abundance of the enzyme responsible for mirna biogenesis, dcl- <dig>  in the vascular tissue  <cit> .

a number of mirnas have been previously identified in the phloem sap of several herbaceous plants  <cit>  and mir <dig> was identified as a long-distance signal for the regulation of plant phosphate homeostasis  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, no data on phloem-mobility of mirnas were available for woody perennials before this study. furthermore, all data obtained to date on herbaceous species were derived from exudates collected from cuts, incisions or punctures  <cit> . phloem sap collected in this manner may contain contamination from outside cells.

the exudate derived from the detached stylets of sap sucking insects such as aphids has been considered the purest form of isolated phloem sap. stylet exudate is regarded as least subject to artefacts, compared with phloem sap collected by other methods. therefore, we chose aphid stylectomy as our preferred phloem sap collection method for this study, using woolly apple aphid. woolly apple aphids feed from apple phloem tissue  <cit>  and their long-term feeding habit at one location and their long stylet bundles facilitate the technology of collecting pure phloem exudates from apple plants . this study demonstrates that apple phloem sap contains small rnas that are major contributors to the phloem sap rna population. thus, we were able to analyse the sap sample and demonstrate the presence of specific mirnas in the phloem sap.

to establish further if presence in the phloem sap of a particular mirna was conserved across species, rna samples isolated from pumpkin phloem sap and vascular tissue were subjected to stem-loop rt-pcr analysis and the levels of expression were compared. those mirnas with significantly higher levels detected in the phloem sap than in the surrounding vasculature are more likely to be non cell-autonomous. similarly, mirnas with higher levels detected in the vasculature are more likely to be cell-autonomous. based on this assumption, more than half the analysed mirnas showed higher levels of accumulation in the phloem sap. in particular, accumulation of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> was more than ten-fold higher in the phloem sap than in the vascular tissue, suggesting a possibility of an active mechanism regulating their presence in the phloem sap. all these mirnas were also detected in the apple se sample, suggesting some conservation in mirna non cell-autonomy across plant species. similarly, mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  which were not detected in apple phloem sap, were also less abundant in the pumpkin phloem sap sample and, with the exception of mir <dig>  were not cloned from brassica napus phloem sap  <cit> , implying conservation of cell-autonomy for these mirnas. some exceptions suggest differences in phloem-mobility of specific mirnas among species or possibly between herbaceous and woody plants; in particular, mir <dig> and mir <dig> accumulated in the phloem sap of pumpkin and brassica napus, but could not be amplified from the apple phloem sap.

the role of mirnas in the phloem sap
the presence of small rnas, including specific mirnas, in the se raises the question of their role in the phloem sap. there are two reasons why rna might be present in the se. firstly, some rna molecules have a role in long-distance signalling. experiments demonstrating long-distance movements of mrna through grafted tissue support this role  <cit> . it is therefore possible that some mirnas also acquired a long-distance signalling role. indeed, a demonstration of shoot-to-root transport and biological activity of shoot-derived mir <dig> in roots is consistent with the role as a long-distance signal for the regulation of plant phosphate homeostasis  <cit>  and the graft-transmissible induction of potato tuberisation by mir <dig> implies its long-distance signalling role  <cit> . secondly, rna may be dragged by the bulk flow of solutes from companion cell to ses and therefore reflect the gene expression in the companion cell; for example, the thioredoxin and actin mrnas were detected in the ses of rice  <cit> , and a sucrose transporter, an aquaporin, and a proton atpase mrna were detected in the ses of barley  <cit> . therefore, mirnas in the phloem might be accidental outflow from companion cells. however, this hypothesis is not supported by microinjection experiments that exclude diffusion of small rnas through plasmodesmata and indicate that specific proteins are required to enable transport of a small rnas through plasmodesmata  <cit> , suggesting a highly regulated mechanism for small rna transport. in addition, not all mirnas that were detected in apple phloem tissue were found in the phloem sap, possibly because their movement into the phloem sap is actively prevented. it remains to be determined definitively whether our finding of mirnas in the apple phloem sap is the result of directed export. at present, the mechanism by which these mirnas enter the se and their role in this type of cells cannot be determined. it may be, for instance, that mirnas in the phloem tissue and sap act to prevent translation and movement of their mrna targets, the majority of which encode transcription factors, which would have detrimental phenotypic and developmental effects if transported long distance in the phloem. this would be consistent with the finding that phloem sap rna interferes with translation  <cit> . indeed, to date neither of the identified and confirmed mirna target mrnas has been shown to move with the phloem across the graft union.

CONCLUSIONS
conserved families of mirnas that target genes responsible for plant growth, development, and stress response are differentially expressed in apple tissues. some of the predicted mirna target transcripts had low abundance in tissues where mirnas were detected. predicted targets of mirnas detected in the phloem sap usually showed only minor differences in expression levels between tissues. a large proportion of the studied mirnas are abundant in the phloem tissue and in the phloem sap of both apple and several herbaceous species, with some exceptions suggesting differences in phloem-mobility of specific mirnas between species.
