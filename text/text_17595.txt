BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar virchow is commonly associated with gastroenteritis, but it is also known to cause invasive systemic infections . outbreaks of serovar virchow are a significant public health risk in many european, asian and oceanic countries . currently, s. virchow is one of most prevalent salmonella serovars in australia and outbreaks can occur through food-borne transmission via contaminated fruit and vegetables and poor food handling practices  <cit> . in order to track outbreaks of s. virchow, molecular subtyping methods are needed to discriminate between strains, however, no such typing scheme currently exits.

phage typing is a well-established method for discriminating between salmonella strains based on their susceptibility to lytic infection by specific bacteriophages  <cit> . however, discrepancies in phage typing results between different laboratories have been reported  <cit> . there are also several nucleic acid-based typing methods, including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , which involves using restriction enzymes to cut bacterial dna into fragments and analysing the banding patterns following gel electrophoresis  <cit> . however, pfge has limitations in reproducibility and the results can be ambiguous, and is also limited in its ability to discriminate between different strains  <cit> . on the other hand, multiple-loci variable-number tandem repeat analysis , a pcr based method used to detect variation in the number of repeat units in tandem repeat sequences  <cit> , provides improved level of discrimination for many salmonella serovars compared to pfge  <cit> . in addition, multi locus sequence typing  also allows greater discrimination between serovars. it involves detecting allelic differences in the sequences of various housekeeping genes  and can also been extended to include virulence genes  <cit> . even greater resolution can be achieved by identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms  as genotyping targets from whole genome sequence  data, with schemes available for serovars like s. typhimurium  <cit> .

whilst there are mlva and snp typing schemes available for many salmonella serovars there are currently none available for discriminating between the different s. virchow phage type  strains . by mlst, s. virchow strains belong to the eburst group bg <dig>  however, the majority of bg <dig> strains in the mlst database are classified as sequence type  <dig>   <cit> . therefore, additional genotyping targets with a greater degree of discrimination between strains are required for subtyping s. virchow.

clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  have recently been used to subtype more than  <dig> major salmonella serovars including typhimurium, newport and enteritidis . crisprs are sequences consisting of 21– <dig> nucleotides that are repeated in tandem separated by non-repetitive sequences of a similar size  <cit> . a cluster of genes known as crispr-associated genes  is often found near the start of crispr regions  <cit> . crisprs function as a defense system against foreign dna such as plasmids and bacteriophage by producing small rna  that can silence foreign mrna, similar to a rna interference system  <cit> . generally, crisprs vary between salmonella strains in the number of repeats/spacers  <cit> . prophages are also useful for genotyping salmonella but have not as yet been applied to s. virchow as a routine epidemiological tool  <cit> .

like the majority of bacteria, mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, bacteriophages and insertion sequence elements are the main drivers of gene flux in salmonella . this organism has acquired many of its virulence genes from mobile elements and they are often found within islands, referred to as salmonella pathogenicity islands   <cit> . other virulence factors such as type iii secreted effectors can be found encoded in prophage regions  <cit> . until recently only one other s. virchow genome had been reported  <cit> . the genome for s. virchow sl <dig>  a pt <dig> strain that was isolated in the united states, was studied as part of a broader comparative study of 28 s. enterica strains  <cit> . similarly, during the preparation of this manuscript, a second s. virchow draft genome was reported as part of a large wgs phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> salmonella serovars. these studies showed that s. virchow strains were most closely related to strains of the heidelberg serovar and carry distinctive crispr regions  <cit> , however, a comprehensive genomic comparison of different s. virchow strains has yet to be reported.

here we report our comparative analyses of the genome of an australian isolate of s. virchow pt  <dig>  with the published genome of s. virchow pt <dig> . we report a comparative analysis with  <dig> other salmonella genomes that reveals the mobile element content of s. virchow strains and furthers our understanding of the evolution of this important food-borne pathogen. we have also identified new discriminatory genotyping targets that can be combined with existing salmonella genotyping schemes to elucidate the relatedness of individual s. virchow isolates.

RESULTS
whole genome comparison of s. virchow svq <dig> and s. virchow sl491
the draft genome of s. virchow svq <dig>  consists of a  <dig>  mbp chromosome and four plasmids that range from  <dig>  to 37 kb . differences between the s. virchow svq <dig> chromosome and s. virchow sl <dig> chromosome include  <dig> genes that makes up a remnant prophage in svq <dig>  the s. virchow sl <dig> genome is larger than s. virchow svq <dig> genome with addition of  <dig> genes that are distributed amongst three prophage and a genomic island that were likely acquired via lateral gene transfer  . read mapping was used to confirm that the observed absence of s. virchow sl <dig> prophage and islands regions in s. virchow svq <dig> was genuine and not as the result of assembly errors . the genomic island encodes the aminoglycoside resistance gene rmtc and a partial mercury resistance transposon operon  <cit> . s. virchow svq <dig> carries four plasmids that are absent in s. virchow sl <dig>  the largest svq <dig> plasmid shares 96–98% identity across 78% of the non-virulence plasmid pou <dig> found s. dublin and encodes a conjugative transfer system  <cit> . the other three plasmids are non-conjugative and are each unambiguously assembled into a single circular contig . we detected  <dig> variants within coding regions between the two s. virchow genomes, including  <dig> snps,  <dig> single nucleotide frame-shift indels, and  <dig> three-nucleotide in-frame indels . by comparison, the genome of s. heidelberg sl <dig> differs from the genome of s. virchow svq <dig> by approximately  <dig>  snps.figure  <dig>

snp containing genes provide limited discrimination of s. virchow isolates
we tested  <dig> genes that contained snps between the genomes of s. virchow svq <dig> and s. virchow sl <dig> that may be potential discriminatory genotyping targets . amplicons were sequenced from 45 s. virchow isolates that had been collected from various outbreaks in australia , as well as s. virchow svq <dig> and s. virchow sl <dig>  only one gene out of  <dig>  encoding a probable pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductase , was determined to be a potential target for discriminating australian s. virchow pt <dig> isolates. in s. virchow svq <dig>  and four other related isolates from same outbreak, this gene contained a cytosine  at position  <dig> in the  <dig>  kb gene, whereas the remaining isolates  had a thymine  in this position. the remaining  <dig> genes were found to have a conserved sequence in all  <dig> australian s. virchow isolates. in all cases the sequencing of svq <dig> and sl <dig> genotyping candidates was consistent with the original snp prediction.table  <dig>

crisprs as potential targets for discrimination of s. virchow isolates
like the majority of salmonella serovars, s. virchow svq <dig> has two crisprs: crispr- <dig>  which is  <dig>  kb in length and has  <dig> spacers, and crispr- <dig>  which is 1 kb in length and has  <dig> spacers . comparisons of crisprs in s. virchow svq <dig> and s. virchow sl <dig> revealed that crispr- <dig> is substantially larger in sl <dig> with  <dig> spacers. however, only the first  <dig> spacers are conserved between both s. virchow genomes, indicating that there may be sufficient variability within this region to sub-type s. virchow strains. crispr- <dig> is identical between the two s. virchow genomes.figure  <dig>

the crispr- <dig> region was sequenced in fifteen australian s. virchow isolates consisting of various phage types  to determine the level of variation between strains . the fifteen strains selected include at least two strains from each of seven different outbreaks, that have occurred between  <dig> and  <dig>  three allelic types of crispr- <dig> were observed based on the presence/absence of particular spacer sequences . crispr typing was able to distinguish s. virchow svq <dig>  and a second pt <dig> isolate from the same outbreak  from other australian pt <dig> isolates due to the absence of spacer  <dig>  the absence of this spacer distinguishes s. virchow svq <dig> and 07q-sv- <dig> from the other pt <dig> isolates, demonstrating that crisprs can be used to help discriminate between s. virchow strains within a phage type. notably, pt <dig> isolates are characterized by the absence of a different spacer .table  <dig>

genomic analysis of s. virchow svq1
the genome of s. virchow svq <dig> was compared with  <dig> salmonella genomes to determine genetic differences between virchow and the other serovars . the comparison revealed that the genomic backbone of s. virchow is similar to the genomes of other salmonella serovars, including key virulence factors. the s. virchow genome encodes the two type iii secretion systems that are conserved in all salmonella serovars and are encoded on salmonella pathogenicity islands . s. virchow also carries nine other known spis that are conserved within other salmonella genomes, with the exception of spi- <dig> . the intact spi- <dig> island in s. typhi ct <dig> carries a type vi secretion system , two fimbrial gene clusters  and the invasin, pagn  <cit> . however, the spi- <dig> in the s. virchow genome is missing the t6ss but it still possesses the two fimbrial clusters and pagn .table  <dig>

the whole genome comparison with other salmonella serovars revealed that s. virchow svq <dig> contains several regions of difference  . rods represent sequences that are present in s. virchow svq <dig> but absent in most other salmonella genomes. these rods include three putative genomic islands, defined as rods that contained integrase genes or evidence of integrase mediated insertion  in chromosomal integration hot-spots , and three putative prophage elements . putative prophage elements could be distinguished from genomic islands by the presence phage structural or replication genes. flanking direct repeats could be defined at the boundaries of the three prophage regions and gi-argu . there are also several other rods including the  <dig>  kb o-antigen biosynthetic gene cluster between gln and galf , as well as three chaperone-usher fimbrial clusters that are sporadically distributed amongst other salmonella serovars . s. virchow also encodes the r-, m- and s- subunits characteristic of a type i restriction modification system: sesv_ <dig>  sev_ <dig>  sesv_ <dig> each exhibit 91%, 97% and 52% amino acid identity with the corresponding subunits of the ecoai enzyme , respectively. the dna-recognition domain  of the s-subunit is unique to s. virchow suggesting that the s. virchow heteromeric enzyme may resemble ecoai mechanistically, but may have different sequence specificity.

gi-phev is a  <dig>  kb genomic island that is only found in two other salmonella genomes  and has likely been acquired by lgt followed by integration into trnaphev. notably it carries an orphan cytosine c5-methyltransferase  that may play a role in global regulation by site-specific dna methylation throughout the genome. gi-phev is inserted directly adjacent to spi- <dig>  which is a  <dig>  kb pathogenicity island encoding a putative lyase, a hydrolase, an oxidase, and an arylsulphatase regulator and is known to be involved in systemic infection of mice and replication inside murine macrophages  <cit> . all 47 s. virchow isolates in this study were found to contain gi-phev on the basis of pcr amplification across the 5′ and 3′ boundaries of the island .

gi-leux is a  <dig>  kb region inserted next to trnaleux in place of the spi- <dig> which is found in s. typhi ct <dig> and s. enteritidis p <dig> . the island encodes an integrase and a degraded genomic island type iv secretion system , indicating that it appears to be a remnant integrative conjugative element  . although the majority of conjugal transfer genes are missing, the s. virchow gi-leux encodes the archetypal gi-t4ss conjugative coupling protein trad/vird <dig> gene , albeit with a frame-shift that truncates vird <dig> by  <dig> amino acids. when compared with previously defined representative t4ss sequences  <cit> , s. virchow vird <dig> shares the most similarity  with vird <dig> homologs from the related and previously characterized ices s. typhi ct <dig> spi- <dig>   <cit> , h. influenzae icehin <dig>   <cit>  and p. aeruginosa pap-i   <cit> . interestingly, the degraded gi-t4ss region encoded in gi-leux shares ~90% nucleotide identity with gi-t4ss regions within the complete genomes of klebsiella pneumoniae strains  <dig>  and ntuh-k <dig> , suggesting that gi-leux belongs to a larger sub-group of uncharacterized ices. like gi-phev, a gi-leux was identified in all 47 s. virchow isolates in this study using pcr ; however, further whole-genome sequencing would be required to determine the variability of this region amongst other strains of s. virchow.

s. virchow svq <dig> carries a sope prophage
s. virchow svq <dig> has three prophage regions encoded on the chromosome, only one of which is intact . prophage  <dig> and  <dig> are incomplete ~ <dig>  kb and ~21 kb phage remnants, respectively, and prophage  <dig> is absent from the s. virchow sl <dig> genome. both s. virchow strains contain an intact prophage which harbors the virulence gene sope and shares 92–99% nucleotide identity over 67% of the s. typhimurium gifsy- <dig> prophage which carries the gogb type iii secreted effector protein . sope is a type iii secreted effector protein that induces membrane ruffling and promotes bacterial entry into host cells . a previous study has revealed that the sope gene and 200 bp of flanking sequences  is sporadically distributed on a lambdoid prophage similar to the gifsy- <dig> prophage among other salmonella serovars including s. gallinarum, s. dublin and s. enteritidis and on a non-gifsy prophage in s. typhi  <cit> . it has been proposed that the sope cassette was transferred between bacteriophage families by homologous recombination  <cit> , a contention that is supported by our observation in s. virchow. although the sope prophage in virchow is significantly different to the other known sope prophages in other salmonella genomes, the  <dig>  kb sope cassette is 97% identical to the cassettes in s. typhi ct <dig> and 93% identical to the ones found in s. gallinarum, s. dublin and s. enteritidis. pcr amplification of the sope gene and across the boundaries of the sope cassette was used to confirm the presence of this sope prophage in svq <dig>  sl <dig> and the other 45 s. virchow isolates . the prevalence of the sope prophage in the s. virchow sl <dig> genome and in all australian isolates tested suggests that it is a defining feature of s. virchow.figure  <dig>

discussion
s. virchow is of significant public health importance and has a high prevalence in australia, asia and europe  <cit> . isolates within this serovar show high levels of genetic relatedness that make discriminating between strains in outbreak investigations difficult  <cit> . the s. virchow svq <dig> genome has provided the opportunity to investigate potential targets for sub-typing closely related s. virchow isolates. based on our comparisons of the genomes of s. virchow svq <dig> and s. virchow sl <dig> we identified  <dig> genes that contain snp or small indel differences between these strains. however, when testing a subset of these candidate targets using a collection of 45 s. virchow isolates collected from different outbreaks within australia only one out of the  <dig> genes tested could discriminate svq <dig> from all other s. virchow strains in this study. the gene is predicted to encode a pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductase, a conserved housekeeping gene in salmonella, which we propose could be used as part of a typing scheme to discriminate between s. virchow pt <dig> isolates. the lack of other discriminatory snps in the set of genes examined is likely due to the selection bias introduced by comparing only two genome sequences. given the growing availability of high-throughput sequencing technologies we expect that further discriminatory snps will be identified by wgs of multiple s. virchow isolates rather than through pcr-based validation of the remaining candidate genes identified in this study. furthermore, although routine pathogen surveillance and outbreak investigation will increasingly be carried out by wgs  <cit> , there remains a need for simple molecular genotyping tests.

in this study we found that the crispr- <dig> region could be used to discriminate s. virchow pt <dig> isolates. crisprs were selected as a genotyping target because they were found to be one of the most rapidly evolving regions in bacterial genomes  <cit> . crispr typing has also been successfully applied to more than nine other salmonella serovars  <cit> . despite sharing nearly all crispr- <dig> spacer sequences in common, three allelic types of crispr- <dig> were observed in the australian strains including one associated with pt <dig> strains. however, the different alleles of crispr- <dig> are caused by deletions of single spacers rather than the acquisition of new spacers. in contrast, crispr- <dig> from s. virchow sl <dig> contains  <dig> spacers not found in australian isolates suggesting evolutionary differences. even though crisprs are considered to be rapidly evolving elements both crispr- <dig> and crispr- <dig> in the australian s. virchow strains have not accumulated new spacer sequences over a seven year period, suggesting that the us strain s. virchow sl <dig> has been exposed to a greater variety of mobile dna.

there is sufficient variation within crispr- <dig> that it can be used to discriminate between closely related s. virchow strains. despite their repetitive nature, crisprs can also be compared using wgs data, as the repeat units in the crisprs are short  and are separated by variable, non-repetitive spacer sequences. most currently available sequencers can produce reads long enough to span these repeat units and overlap with the spacers allowing for correct assembly, as has been recently demonstrated in a study of  <dig> newly sequenced s. enterica genomes  <cit> . due to relatively large size of the crispr- <dig>  using sanger sequencing to sequence the whole region is time-consuming, however, we have observed three allelic types of crispr- <dig> in local s. virchow strains that differ by the deletion of a single spacer sequence. therefore, it a pcr based assay to determine the presence/absence of a specific spacer sequence by designing primers that bind to conserved spacers that flanks a deletion site.

genomic comparisons between s. virchow svq <dig> and s. virchow sl <dig> revealed that lateral gene transfer is the major contributor for variation in the chromosome, as for other enteric bacteria. excluding plasmids,  <dig> % of svq <dig> genome is not shared with sl <dig>  conversely,  <dig> % of the sl <dig> genome is not present in svq <dig>  the bulk of the non-shared dna in sl <dig> is associated with prophage regions, which are absent in svq <dig>  this is a common theme in salmonella, as prophages are known to contribute significantly to variation in strains of the same serovar  <cit> . comparisons with other published salmonella genomes revealed several regions of difference in s. virchow genomes, including genomic islands located within regions in the chromosome that are common dna integration sites in other serovars. for example, trna-leux is a region of the chromosome that is often associated with foreign dna in other salmonella and e. coli strains  <cit> . in s. virchow, the gi-leux appears to encode the remnants of an integrative conjugative element that is distinct from other well-characterized ice representatives, including the salmonella spi- <dig> family  <cit> . although the degradation of the gi-t4ss conjugal transfer region indicates that the s. virchow gi-leux is no longer self-transmissible, the island is present in all 47 s. virchow isolates tested in this study suggesting that there may be a selective advantage to retaining one or more of the encoded cargo genes.

salmonella employs the spi- <dig> type iii secretion system to translocate effector proteins into host cells  <cit> . these effectors then manipulate host cellular function to enhance the invasiveness and survival of salmonella. sope is an effector that is responsible for entry into epithelial cells by inducing cytoskeleton rearrangement and membrane ruffling causing the membrane of the cell to wrap around and engulf the bacterium, a process called macropinocytosis  <cit> . knocking out the sope effector in s. dublin prevented invasion and attenuated disease  <cit> . thus, it is believed that the acquisition of the sope gene was an important step in the emergence of epidemic salmonella serovars  <cit> . here we report that s. virchow encodes sope on a gifsy-1-like prophage that is dissimilar to the sope prophages found in other salmonella serovars. the presence of this virulence factor in different bacteriophages might increase the efficiency of horizontal transfer of sope between different strains by increasing the host range and helping to evade immunity imposed by other resident prophages and crisprs  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have undertaken a comparative analysis of the s. virchow svq <dig> genome and identified several genomic islands, prophages and other regions of difference that are characteristic of s. virchow. we have demonstrated that sesv_ <dig> and the crispr- <dig> region are genotyping targets that can discriminate between closely related s. virchow isolates of the same phage type. the genotyping targets described in this study could be used in conjunction with other salmonella genotyping targets to provide enhanced resolution of s. virchow strains involved in different outbreaks. additional genome sequencing of s. virchow strains will help to evaluate the effectiveness of crispr typing for outbreak investigations and identify other potential genotyping targets. considering s. virchow’s public health importance as a human pathogen, the availability of the s. virchow svq <dig> genome is a vital step for understanding the evolution and global distribution of this serovar and the mechanisms in which it causes invasive infections.
