BACKGROUND
in prokaryotic genomes, genes within operons usually have much shorter intergenic distances than genes at the borders of transcription units  <cit> . the distinct organization of operonic genes in near proximity is thought to facilitate gene co-expression and co-regulation. recent evidence suggests that some eukaryotic genes also tend to be in close physical vicinity. for example, in the genomes of yeast, worm, and fly, a number of functionally related genes were shown to be located one near another  <cit> . in mammals, as genes are more dispersed throughout the genomes, the presence of two genes in immediate proximity of each other has long been regarded as a rare exception. surprisingly, after the human and mouse genomes were decoded, there are more than 10% of the genes found to be arranged as bidirectional  gene pairs with two genes separated only by a less than  <dig> kb of genomic dna  <cit> . whilst some of these neighboring genes have evolved from a common ancestral gene by duplication, many are totally unrelated to each other and encode proteins involved in diverse biochemical pathways in different compartments of cells and tissues  <cit> .

to date, the transcriptional regulation of mammalian head-to-head gene pairs remains largely unknown, but a few studies have suggested that the two closely adjacent genes in divergent orientation can be co-regulated by a single transcription factor binding to a specific promoter region  <cit> . known examples include the human parkinson's disease-related pacrg-park <dig> gene pair, the highly homologous mouse surfeit surf1-surf <dig> gene pair, and the non-homologous mouse sars2-mrps <dig> gene pair, in which the expression of two genes is delicately regulated by a transcription factor: in these cases n-myc, yy- <dig>  and nf-y, respectively  <cit> . in this report, we provide evidence for the existence of an evolutionarily conserved head-to-head gene pair, known as the prepl-c2orf <dig> gene pair, whose expression actually depends on the synergic cooperation of two transcription factors binding to a critical bidirectional regulatory element within a short intergenic region.

prepl , formerly named as kiaa <dig>  <cit> , is a member of the prolyloligopeptidase family of serine proteases  <cit> . sequence analysis and secondary structure predictions revealed that this protease is similar to oligopeptidase b which utilizes a serine hydroxyl group to cleave target proteins. however, unlike oligopeptidase b which preferentially cleaves after an arginine or lysine residue, prepl cannot cleave after any basic residue of the substrates  <cit> . this suggests that the function of prepl may be different from that of oligopeptidase b and other known prolyloligopeptidases  <cit> . clinical studies have demonstrated that chromosomal deletions involving the prepl gene often lead to autosomal recessive syndromes such as hypotonia, facial dysmorphism, neonatal seizures and developmental delay  <cit> . the severity of these syndromes is closely related to the size of chromosomal deletion and the number of genes involved. for instance, patients with a relative mild hcs  are missing both alleles of slc3a <dig>  and prepl on chromosome 2p <dig>  in a more severe, atypical hcs phenotype, an additional gene c2orf <dig>  is deleted, whereas in the most severe 2p <dig> deletion syndrome the open reading frame of ppm1b  is seriously disrupted  <cit> . interestingly, among these four cluster genes that are associated with autosomal recessive disorders, only prepl and c2orf <dig> were found to lie immediately adjacent to each other in a head-to-head configuration in many species including human, mouse, rat, dog and chicken. the evolutionarily conserved close proximity and divergent orientation indicate that the two genes are likely co-regulated by some shared intergenic regulatory elements.

herein, we determined that prepl and c2orf <dig> are separated by only a 405-bp intergenic dna region in the human genome. within this small intergenic region, a 243-bp gc-rich segment was shown to function as a bidirectional minimal promoter to initiate transcription of both flanking genes. by performing a series of promoter analyses, including chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, two transcription factors, nrf- <dig> and yy- <dig>  were indentified to be involved in the regulation of the bidirectional minimal promoter. the functional cooperation between these two key transcription factors, along with their genomic binding sites and some cis-acting repressive elements, is essential for the transcriptional regulation and tissue distribution of the prepl-c2orf <dig> head-to-head gene pair.

RESULTS
tissue expression patterns of human prepl and c2orf <dig> genes
in order to determine the presence and expression patterns of the prepl and c2orf <dig> genes, we performed northern blot analysis on polya+ rna isolated from  <dig> different human tissues. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  while the prepl probe identified a band of ~ <dig> kb present predominantly in brain and heart, hybridization of the same array with the c2orf <dig> probe revealed an abundant band of ~ <dig> kb detected in almost every tissue examined. this suggests that the transcriptions of the prepl and c2orf <dig> genes in most tissues are likely to be differentially controlled by some regulatory elements situated within their 5'-upstream intergenic region.

determination of the size of the intergenic region between human c2orf <dig> and prepl genes
following characterization of tissue distribution patterns, we attempted to pinpoint the precise transcriptional start sites  of the c2orf <dig> and prepl genes to ascertain the length of their intergenic spacer. we first utilized exon-specific primers to amplify genomic dna fragments encompassing the first exons of both genes. the pcr products were then purified and sequenced to confirm that these two genes are indeed arranged in a head-to-head configuration on human chromosome 2p <dig> . by performing 5'-race with fetal brain-derived cdna as a template, both genes were identified to contain multiple tsss including two for c2orf <dig> and three for prepl . it should be noted that, during the course of 5'-race analysis, we unexpectedly detected a prepl splice variant which uses an alternative, 184-bp untranslated exon  <dig> . with this newly found 5'-untranslated exon, the shortest intergenic distance between the closest tsss for prepl and c2orf <dig> was calculated to be  <dig> bp . in order to facilitate our subsequent analyses of the promoter activity of this 405-bp intergenic region, here we denoted the positions of nucleotides with respect to - <dig>  the first intergenic nucleotide in front of the prepl transcriptional start site, and - <dig>  the intergenic nucleotide right before the transcriptional start site of c2orf <dig> .

interspecies comparison of the gene order, orientation and intergenic spacing of the prepl and c2orf <dig> genes
to investigate whether the close physical proximity and head-to-head configuration of the prepl and c2orf <dig> genes are conserved throughout evolution, we compared the chromosomal localization and transcriptional orientation of both genes in different species including human, mouse, rat, dog and chicken. the results revealed that not only the gene order but also the compact head-to-head arrangement are evolutionarily conserved . even the size and nucleotide sequence of their intergenic spacing were found to be conserved, with a fragment of about  <dig> bp spanning from part of the exon  <dig> of c2orf <dig> to the first two-thirds of the intergenic region, showing an average gc content greater than 70% . by aligning the human, mouse and rat sequences of this well-conserved, gc-rich region, several consensus transcription factor binding sites were identified. on the basis of these findings, we then attempted to analyze the possible role of these sites in governing the expression of the prepl-c2orf <dig> bidirectional gene pair.

functional characterization of the asymmetric bidirectional promoter activity of the intergenic region
in order to identify the key elements responsible for the transcriptional regulation of the prepl-c2orf <dig> gene pair, a series of dna fragments containing all or part of the 405-bp intergenic region were cloned into the promoterless pgl3-basic vector followed by luciferase activity assays. due to the fact that the regulatory elements are often situated within 300-bp upstream or downstream of the tsss  <cit> , here we cloned a  <dig> -bp fragment, from position - <dig> to + <dig> , consisting of the entire intergenic region and approximately  <dig> bp beyond its two boundaries, as the full-length promoter construct. by measuring the luciferase activity in human u87mg cells where both c2orf <dig> and prepl were adequately expressed, this full-length -718/+ <dig> construct was shown to possess a promoter activity stronger than the control sv <dig> in driving reporter gene expression in the sense  orientation . several progressive deletions from the 5'-end of the full-length -718/+ <dig> construct were then generated in an attempt to determine the minimal promoter region necessary to drive prepl gene transcription. as summarized in figure  <dig>  results from luciferase activity measurements pinpointed a 220-bp segment, from - <dig> to - <dig> spanning the first  <dig> bp of c2orf <dig> exon  <dig> to the 180-bp 5'-end of the intergenic region, that is critical for the transcription of the prepl gene. similar progressive deletions from the full-length +335/- <dig> insert were also constructed to clarify the promoter activity in the antisense  direction. the luciferase assays demonstrated that a 218-bp segment, from - <dig> to - <dig> spanning the 5'-end 203-bp of the intergenic region and the first  <dig> bp of c2orf <dig> exon  <dig>  is responsible for driving transcription of the c2orf <dig> gene .

based on the above results, we then cloned a 243-bp fragment  covering both the identified -445/- <dig> promoter region for prepl and the -203/- <dig> promoter region for c2orf <dig> in two opposite orientations and measured its potential bidirectional promoter activity. to our surprise, while no obvious difference was observed between the assays driven by the 243-bp  fragment alone or by the full-length  construct toward the prepl direction, the same 243-bp fragment but in opposite orientation  was able to significantly increase the luciferase activity in the c2orf <dig> direction by at least 12-fold as compared to the -203/- <dig> or the control +335/- <dig> full-length insert . furthermore, removal of the sequence of the 243-bp fragment either from the 5'- or 3'-end  all resulted in a decrease of the luciferase activities in both directions. together these findings suggest that the 243-bp fragment is likely to function as a bidirectional minimal promoter, and that the region from position - <dig> to - <dig> may serve as a repressive element to suppress the transcription activity of the c2orf <dig> gene.

to further confirm the functional significance of the identified 243-bp regulatory element, we determined the effect of its promoter strength on the expressions of the two flanking genes. the results, similar to those obtained by the aforementioned northern blot analyses , revealed that the levels of c2orf <dig> transcripts remained constant in various cell lines whereas prepl was found to be expressed in brain h <dig> and u87mg cells but much less in lung wi <dig> and imr <dig> cells . in accordance with this, although no notable difference was observed in the relative luciferase activity driven by the 243-bp  fragment toward the c2orf <dig> direction, the relative luciferase activity of the same fragment toward the opposite prepl direction was shown to be more elevated in brain than in lung cells . these results indicate that the 243-bp minimal promoter element is likely responsible for directing differential expression of the prepl gene, if not also for the neighboring c2orf <dig> gene.

it has previously been proposed that, in addition to the bidirectional minimal promoter, dna methylation may also be participated in the transcriptional regulation of bidirectional gene pairs  <cit> . by using methprimer software  and a modified criteria  <cit> , which defined the size of a cpg island as larger than  <dig> bp and the ratio of observed versus expected cpgs as greater than  <dig> , we identified a gc-rich fragment spanning from part of the exon  <dig> of c2orf <dig> to the first two-thirds of the 405-bp intergenic region . to elucidate whether the differential expression of c2orf <dig> and prepl is contributed by dna methylation, we measured the methylation status of each individual cpg site. the assay results displayed no notable differences in the cpg methylation patterns of various normal tissues . this indicates that the tissue-specific pattern of both c2orf <dig> and prepl genes may not be controlled directly by dna methylation, but rather be regulated by some transcriptional factors binding to the identified 243-bp bidirectional minimal promoter.

identification of transcription factor binding sites in the bidirectional minimal promoter
sequence comparison revealed that the 243-bp bidirectional minimal promoter is evolutionarily conserved among distant organisms. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  although neither tata-box nor ccaat element were found in this intergenic region, several potential transcription factor binding sites were recognized in silico by matinspector  and motif  softwares. these potential binding sites include two for tfap- <dig> , at nt - <dig> to -400; and tfap- <dig>  at nt - <dig> to -255), one for mzf- <dig> , one for usf , two for nrf- <dig>  at nt - <dig> to -298; and nrf- <dig> at nt - <dig> to -290) and one for yy- <dig> . among these putative binding sequences, some core binding sites and their flanking segments such as those for usf, nrf- <dig>  and yy- <dig> were found to be evolutionarily more conserved than other transcription factor binding sites . in particular, as the usf-binding sequence is known to be one of the most frequently predicted motifs in many gene promoters, here we chose to first examine the possible role of nrf- <dig> and yy- <dig> in the activation of c2orf <dig> and prepl transcriptions. the luciferase assays performed in u87mg cells showed that point mutations at the nrf- <dig> site  and -445/-203mu_nrf-2) had no major effect on the promoter activity in either direction . however, mutations occurring at the nrf- <dig> binding site  and -445/-203mu_nrf-2) caused a significant reduction of the luciferase activity as compared to that of the control 243-bp bidirectional minimal promoter . these results indicate that the second nrf- <dig> binding sequence  is essential for the activation of the prepl-c2orf <dig> bidirectional gene pair. moreover, mutant constructs at the yy- <dig> site  displayed a drastically reduced promoter activity toward the prepl direction  but a less severe reduction in the c2orf <dig> direction . this implies that the yy- <dig> site is more important than the nrf- <dig> site for prepl expression. the same data also conclude that the nrf- <dig> binding site is functionally more critical than the yy- <dig> site in driving c2orf <dig> transcription, as evident from mutations at the nrf- <dig> site resulting in a much decreased reporter gene activity toward the c2orf <dig> direction . more significantly, double mutations at the nrf- <dig> and the yy- <dig> binding sites /yy- <dig> and -203/-445mu_nrf-2/yy-1) further decreased the promoter activity to the basal level in both directions . similar results were also observed in other cell lines including brain h <dig>  gbm <dig>  and gbm <dig> cell lines . together these findings provide the first strong evidence that, in addition to their individual effects on the full activity of the bidirectional minimal promoter region, the nrf- <dig> and yy- <dig> transcription factors may coordinately participate in driving both gene expressions in an additive manner.

characterization of the specific nrf- <dig> and yy- <dig> transcription factors binding to the bidirectional promoter by emsa
after we assessed the regulatory importance of the nrf- <dig> and yy- <dig> binding sites within the intergenic region, the emsa was performed to study the protein-binding to such sites. as shown in figure  <dig>  by incubating cell nuclear protein extracts with the -311/- <dig> probe that contained two nrf- <dig> binding sites, three major shifted bands were detected . these band-shifts were sequence-specific as addition of an excess of unlabeled wild-type probe could compete out the binding . interestingly, while competitors containing mutated nrf- <dig> site failed to affect the binding of nuclear proteins to hot probe , a strong competitive effect was obtained with the use of a 10-fold excess of cold probe with mutation at the nrf- <dig> site . these results again indicate that nrf- <dig>  the second nrf- <dig> binding sequence from position - <dig> to - <dig>  is more important than nrf- <dig> in regulating the transcription of the prepl-c2orf <dig> bidirectional gene pair. to more clarify the specific binding of nrf- <dig> and yy- <dig> to the bidirectional promoter, the nuclear extracts were incubated with antibodies against nrf- <dig>  yy- <dig>  and nf- <dig> to examine the inhibition and/or supershift of the protein/dna complex. as revealed in figure  <dig>  by incubating nuclear protein extracts either with the same -311/- <dig> probe or with the -290/- <dig> probe which contained the sole yy- <dig> binding site, several retarded bands were detected . such a binding activity with the -311/- <dig> probe or -290/- <dig> probe could be significantly competed with 1- or 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide . furthermore, when emsa was performed in the presence of specific anti-nrf- <dig> or anti-yy- <dig> antibodies, a supershifted band was observed in each case . in both cases no supershift was observed with the negative control anti-nf- <dig> antibody . these results suggest that the two identified binding sites are indeed associated with sequence-specific binding of nrf- <dig> and yy- <dig> transcription factors present in the cell nuclear extracts.

in vivo occupancy of the bidirectional minimal promoter by endogenous nrf- <dig> and yy- <dig> transcription factors
to further verify whether nrf- <dig> and yy- <dig> are actually bound to the bidirectional minimal promoter of the prepl-c2orf <dig> gene pair in vivo, chromatin immunoprecipitations  were performed in u87mg cells using antibodies specific for nrf- <dig> and yy- <dig>  as a negative control, another immunoprecipitation from the same stock was carried out using anti-igg antibody. the regions surrounding the functional nrf- <dig> and yy- <dig> binding sites were analyzed in parallel on immunoprecipitated chromatin. for pcr amplifications, a 1/ <dig> dilution of input chromatin was selected as a standard to indicate the efficiency of the pcr reactions. as shown in figure  <dig>  while nothing was detected with the use of the control anti-igg antibody, fragments from the bidirectional minimal promoter of the intergenic region were able to be immunoprecipitated by both anti-nrf- <dig> and anti-yy- <dig> antibodies  in higher amounts than the 1/ <dig> input chromatin . similar results were also obtained from other chip assays using additional cell lines such as brain h <dig>  gbm <dig> and gbm <dig> cell lines . thus, it is clear from these studies that nrf- <dig> and yy- <dig> are bound specifically to the bidirectional minimal promoter of the prepl-c2orf <dig> head-to-head gene pair in vivo.

discussion
bidirectional promoters have received considerable attention because of their capability to regulate the transcription of two downstream genes  <cit> . they are commonly present in prokaryotes and low eukaryotes but are considered to be rare in higher organisms. recent genome sequencing efforts, however, have revealed that a large number of mammalian genes are in fact closely arranged as divergent  gene pairs and separated only by a less than  <dig> kb of intergenic spacer . no definite explanation can yet be given for the biological and evolutionary advantages of this distinct type of divergent gene pairs. but theoretically, only when two genes are divergently organized in close proximity  can be co-expressed and co-regulated by a shared intergenic bidirectional promoter  <cit> . this statement is supported by a recent study of whole-genome microarray data showing that, in a given cell, approximately 68% of divergent genes are transcribed, compared with 44% of all human genes  <cit> . it seems likely that the presence of bidirectional promoters in mammalian genomes is to facilitate functional co-regulation of two adjacent genes, thus making bidirectional gene pairs more favored by natural selection than any other gene organization. by analyzing and comparing the intergenic sequences of bidirectional gene pairs in different species, it has been shown that the majority of intergenic regions lack tata and ccaat boxes but are rich in gc content  <cit> . those findings are consistent with our characterization of the prepl-c2orf <dig> bidirectional gene pair, in that neither a tata box nor a ccaat element could be found within the identified 405-bp intergenic region . a cpg-rich island was indeed recognized, but its methylation status does not seem to play an important role in regulating the expression levels of the two downstream genes . it was also reported that the intergenic regions found in mammalian genomes often display a mirror sequence composition, such that the gs and ts dominate on one side of the midpoint whilst cs and as dominate on the other side  <cit> . in the case of the prepl-c2orf <dig> bidirectional gene pair presented in this work, however, no such a composition was observed.

it is of interest to note that the prepl-c2orf <dig> gene pair has several features in common with some other human bidirectional gene pairs such as the parkinson's disease-related pacrg-park <dig> gene pair at 6q <dig> – <dig>  and the brain-disease related pdcd10-serpini <dig> gene pair at 3q <dig>  <cit> . in all three cases, the paired genes are non-homologous to each other. prepl, like park <dig> and serpini <dig>  has its tissue specificity and is present mainly in brain and/or heart; where as c2orf <dig>  like pacrg and pdcd <dig>  is expressed like a housekeeping gene in all tissues . more significantly, the genetic variations found in these genes are often correlated with brain or genetic abnormalities. this implies that brain, being the most complex and metabolically active organ in the body, may utilize various bidirectional promoters to direct gene expressions and cellular functions in a more efficient and comprehensive manner.

c2orf <dig> and prepl are known to lie immediately adjacent to each other not only in humans but also in many other species. their evolutionarily conserved gene configuration and close proximity indicate that both genes need to be tightly paired and may thus be co-regulated by some common transcriptional regulatory elements. by generating a series of partial deletion constructs using firefly luciferase as the reporter gene, we first identified a 273-bp gc-rich segment, from position - <dig> to - <dig>  which may serve as a repressive element to suppress in particular the transcriptional activity of the c2orf <dig> gene. this repressive effect is most likely due to some yet unidentified transcriptional repressor, or may be caused by subsequent disturbance of the chromatin structure within this gc-rich dna region. results from luciferase activity assays further suggest that the essential promoter activity is carried within a 243-bp  genomic region, and that two transcription factors, nrf- <dig> and yy- <dig>  can bind onto this critical bidirectional minimal promoter to regulate the expression of both c2orf <dig> and prepl genes . it should be noted that the nucleotide sequence of the -718/- <dig> segment revealed no atg motifs that may interfere with the downstream luciferase gene expression at the level of translation. nonetheless, we need to point out that although highly unlikely, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that rna splice sites may have bypassed the atg of the luciferase reporter in our analysis.

nrf- <dig>  also termed as ga-binding protein or gabp, has long been known to act as a key nuclear activator in the regulation of many mitochondrial-related genes  <cit> . similar to a previous study on the promoter region of the outer mitochondrial membrane translocase tomm <dig> gene  <cit> , in our identified 405-bp intergenic fragment only one of the two putative nrf- <dig> binding sites was found responsible for driving the bidirectional promoter activity. more significantly, nrf- <dig> itself is also arranged as a bidirectional gene pair with its adjacent atp5j  gene on human chromosome  <dig>  by binding to its 5'-intergenic region shared with the atp5j gene, nrf- <dig> is able to auto-regulate its own gene transcription and subsequently affect the expression levels of downstream mitochondrial-related genes  <cit> . in the case of the prepl-c2orf <dig> gene pair, because nrf- <dig> is shown to be more important in driving c2orf <dig> expression and because patients with the 2p <dig> deletion syndromes  often exhibit a unique mitochondrial dysfunction  <cit> , we speculate that the ubiquitously expressed c2orf <dig> gene may possess some cellular functions related to mitochondrial metabolisms and be ultimately regulated by nrf- <dig> along with the collaboration of yy- <dig> transcription factor.

previously, yy- <dig> had been reported to serve as a necessary and sufficient activator for the expression of some bidirectional gene pairs  <cit> . as for the evolutionarily conserved prepl-c2orf <dig> gene pair, mutations occurring at the yy- <dig> binding site were shown to cause significantly decreased promoter activity toward the prepl direction . this suggests that yy- <dig> is functionally more important than nrf- <dig> in driving prepl transcription. moreover, because the dual activator/repressor role of yy- <dig> is often related to its cellular concentration as well as its ability to interact with other cofactors  <cit> , here we propose that yy- <dig> can directly bind to the bidirectional minimal promoter of the prepl-c2orf <dig> gene pair and, depending on the intracellular concentrations of yy- <dig> and its interacting cofactors such as nrf- <dig>  serve as both a positive regulator and a negative regulator in determining the tissue distribution pattern of the prepl gene. finally, double mutations at both the nrf- <dig> and yy- <dig> binding sites completely abolished the activity of the bidirectional minimal promoter in both directions . this implies that, in addition to their individual effect on the full activity of the bidirectional minimal promoter region, nrf- <dig> and yy- <dig> coordinately participate in driving both c2orf <dig> and prepl gene expressions in an additive manner. the functional cooperation between these two transcription factors, along with their binding efficacy to the asymmetric bidirectional minimal promoter and some cis-acting repressive elements, is essential for the transcriptional activation and tissue distribution of the prepl-c2orf <dig> head-to-head gene pair.

CONCLUSIONS
unlike previous reports suggesting that two adjacent genes in a head-to-head configuration can be co-regulated by a single transcription factor binding to a specific promoter segment, here we demonstrated that the expression of the disease-related prepl-c2orf <dig> bidirectional gene pair is in fact dependent on the synergic cooperation of two transcription factors interacting with a 405-bp intergenic dna region. although prepl is present primarily in brain and heart, c2orf <dig> is ubiquitously and abundantly expressed in almost all tissues examined. their distinct expression patterns may not be directly regulated by dna methylation but rather be controlled by the coordinated binding of nrf- <dig> and yy- <dig> onto a 243-bp asymmetric bidirectional minimal promoter. an additional gc-rich region, from nt - <dig> to nt - <dig>  is likely to serve as a repressive element suppressing the transcription activity of the c2orf <dig> gene. finally, various analyses including luciferase activity experiments, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation verified the direct binding of nrf- <dig> and yy- <dig> onto the shared intergenic region, thus confirming that these two transcription factors function coordinately with the bidirectional minimal promoter to regulate the transcriptions of both prepl and c2orf <dig> genes.
