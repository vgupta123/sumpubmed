BACKGROUND
with the advent of the post-genomic era coming, the need is boosting to express a growing number of genes originating from different organisms  <cit> . unfortunately, many of these foreign genes severely interfere with the survival of escherichia coli cells, which could lead to bacteria death or cause significant defects in bacteria growth. what’s more, following the development of biological technology, many genetically engineered e. coli have been constructed and developed for different purposes, such as bioremediation, biomedicine and bioenergy  <cit> . however, their practical applications in the field are still restricted because engineered bacteria may cause new environmental contaminations. to minimize the potential risks, biological containment system was designed to monitor and restrict the distribution of engineered bacteria. generally, containment systems are based on a ‘killer gene’ and a tight ‘regulatory circuit’ that controls expression of the killer gene in response to the presence or absence of environmental signals  <cit> . in order to activate the killer gene expression only at expected condition, usually a specific environment, the promoter that controls bacteria programmed cell death needs to be easily controllable, tightly regulated and environment-responsive.

in general, there are five solutions to manage killer or highly toxic genes expression: manipulation of transcriptional and translational control elements of highly toxic genes, manipulation of the coding sequence, manipulation of the copy number, addition of stabilizing sequences, and empirical selection of e. coli strains  <cit> . among these solutions, manipulation of transcriptional control elements aims at blocking the leaky expression from the common used promoters, such as plac, ptrc, ptac, pt <dig>  ppl, pteta or placuv <dig>  which is critical in toxic gene expression  <cit> . as a result, the manipulation strategies of transcriptional control elements have been described to reduce the possibility of a unexpected toxic event. the strategies include suppression of basal expression from leaky inducible promoters, suppression of read-through transcription from cryptic promoters, tight control of plasmid copy numbers and proteins production as inactive  forms  <cit> .

since the incomplete repression of promoter presents a major problem when cloning genes that encode lethal product to the bacterial host  <cit> , it is obviously critical to tighten the control of gene expression by utilizing a tightly controllable promoter that permits e. coli normal growth until the very moment of highly toxic gene induction. starting from this point, several tightly regulated expression circuits have been developed, such as prha, hybrid plac/ara- <dig>  and pbad-based vectors  <cit> . the widely used pbad derivative expression systems have been verified as useful solutions for their stringentness in toxic protein production in e. coli. expression is induced to high levels on media containing l-arabinose, and tightly shuts off on media with glucose but without l-arabinose, which shows more stringent regulation of target gene expression than other expression systems. however, some problems still exist in this system, such as few vectors available and catabolism repression by glucose  <cit> .

usually, environment-responsive promoters are commonly engineered in inducible expression system, such as promoters sensing ph, temperature, oxygen concentration or iron availability  <cit> . from iron-uptake systems that are evolved by bacteria growing in iron-limiting environment, many iron-related promoters have been reported  <cit> . the promoter from iron-uptake regulon is strongly repressed in iron rich conditions by fur, but fully derepressed in absence of iron  <cit> . usually, fur protein complexing with ferrous irons binds with high affinity to the 19-bp inverted repeat consensus sequence known as the fur box  in the relevant promoter area, which controls transcription of iron-responsive genes in microorganisms  <cit> . fur inhibits transcription initiation by blocking the entry of rna polymerase  to the promoter. this ability is tightly dependent on the relative affinities of rnap and fur to binding sites in the dna  <cit> .

in this study, a novel tightly inducible expression system was developed as an alternative of the current ones. this system, designated pypfhua <dig>  was capable of extremely tight regulation and allowed cloning of genes encoding highly toxic products within various copy-number plasmids. in detail, using e. coli top <dig> as bacterial host, the strong iron-regulated promoter pfhua was selected as the primary candidate. by modifying fur box in promoter sequences and fur repressor synthesis, the tightness of pfhua was decreased to varying degrees. thereinto, pfhua <dig>  which could be strict repressed by excess iron and efficiently induced by iron chelators, was the ideal promoter candidate for toxic gene expression in e. coli host.

RESULTS
preliminary screening for iron-regulated promoters
as described in the previous study  <cit> ,  <dig> promoter candidates were selected from vibrio parahaemolyticus, vibrio cholerae, e. coli and vibrio anguillarum, and their transcription abilities were investigated with puttg as screening vector and iron chelator  <dig> ’-dipyridyl as inducer. samples were adjusted to od600 =  <dig> to measure the green fluorescence emitted by gfp, so the promoter strength and regulation could be simply correlated with the gfp fluorescence. as seen in figure 1a, the promoters psuf, pfes, phuva, pfhua, pviub, and pviua showed relatively high transcription activities with the relative fluorescence  units of over  <dig>  under iron-limiting medium. among them, pfhua owned the highest rf units of  <dig>  and was chosen as the primary candidate for further study.

to evaluate the regulation performance of pfhua, the gfp synthesis was detected when top10/ptpfhuag growing in lb medium supplemented with repressor  or inducer . as shown in figure 1b, even with the repressor addition, an obvious leaky expression was detected under pfhua transcription. based on the data, the induction ratio that showed the tightness of promoter was calculated as  <dig> , indicating that the tightness of pfhua had to be improved for the toxic gene expression.

modifications of pfhua to improve its tightness
pfhua was from v. cholerae ferrichrome outer membrane receptor encoded gene fhua <cit> . its characteristic regions were demonstrated as the same result by three online promoter prediction tools-softberry, bdgp and scope. the fur box  <cit>  spans across − <dig> region . to improve pfhua tightness, the fur box sequences were remolded according to e. coli consensus fur box sequence gataatgatatcattatc  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  strategy  <dig> represented the original pfhua sequence. in strategy  <dig>  the original fur box of pfhua was changed into e. coli consensus fur box sequence by base substitution. in strategy  <dig>  fur box was substituted by enhanced e. coli fur box as described by escolar et al.  <cit> . the enhanced fur box contained five repeats of gataat motif to strengthen the fur protein binding. in strategy  <dig>  two fur boxes were used. one was the original one spanning − <dig> region, and the other one was e. coli consensus fur box sequence across − <dig> region without changing the spacer distance between − <dig> and − <dig> regions. in strategy  <dig>  the fur fragment without pfur was inserted into the upstream of pfhuagfp tt cassette for more fur protein synthesis. in strategy  <dig>  with the same aim, the fur fragment including pfur was inserted. in theory, more fur proteins would be synthesized in strategy  <dig> than in strategy  <dig>  all the above-mentioned strategies aimed to enhance the affinity of fur to the promoter and increase the transcription tightness sequentially.

all the remolded recombinant plasmids were transformed into e. coli top <dig>  resulting in top10/ptpfhuag , top10/ptpfhua1g , top10/ptpfhua2g , top10/ptpfhua3g , top10/ptpfhuagsdfur , top10/ptpfhuagpfursdfur  to check the promoter regulation behaviors. as shown in table  <dig>  the relative fluorescence units under repression and induction were used to calculate the induction ratio and relative induction fold. the highest relative induction fold of  <dig> and the lowest induction ratio of  <dig> were obtained with pfhua. by replacing the original fur box with e. coli consensus fur box in strategy  <dig>  the repression of pfhua was increased greatly from  <dig> to  <dig>  but the induction was decreased by almost half of original value. the similar performances were also obtained in other strategies. especially strategy  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> displayed the high tightness under detection limit, but their relative induction folds were as low as  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, which meant very limited transcription efficiency. as in strategy  <dig>  more gfps were induced than in strategy  <dig> following by less fur protein synthesis, and showed the induction ratio of  <dig>  and relative induction fold of  <dig>  under the same condition, strategy  <dig> was comparable with the well-known tight regulated promoter pbad with the induction ratio of  <dig> and relative induction fold of  <dig>  taken together, there was a balance between the tightness and transcription efficiency, and the improvement of tightness would be accompanied by the decrease of transcription efficiency. taking these two criteria into consideration, pfhua <dig> in strategy  <dig>  performed similarly as pbad, was designated as the final promoter candidate for the next experiments.

performance evaluation of ppfhua <dig> as an inducible tightly regulated expression system
the ability to modulate the target gene expression by partial induction of the promoter activity by applying different concentrations of inducer is a desirable feature for a controllable expression system. to investigate the possibility to modulate the pfhua1-initiated target gene expression in an inducer concentration-dependent manner, the specific gfp yields were measured from the cells of transformed with ptpfhua1g induced with various concentrations of  <dig> ’-dipyridyl . in figure 3a, an exponential gfp yields response was observed with  <dig> ’-dipyridyl in the range of  <dig> to 200 μm, which culminated in a wide range of gfp synthesis with the relative fluorescence units from  <dig> to  <dig>  the maximal specific gfp yield was obtained in 200 μm  <dig> ’-dipyridyl. however, as  <dig> ’-dipyridyl concentration increased to  <dig> and 600 μm, gfp yields decreased gradually. this could be attributed to the harsh iron-limiting condition created by high concentration of  <dig> ’-dipyridyl for chelating divalent cations, which impaired the e. coli growth for the difficulty to uptake enough iron from the medium. it could be found that  <dig> ’-dipyridyl less than 200 μm exerted little influence on e. coli growth, and the od <dig> values at the end of induction were between  <dig>  and  <dig> . as  <dig> ’-dipyridyl concentration continued to increase to 400 μm and 600 μm, od <dig> value drastically decreased to  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. therefore, 0 ~ 200 μm  <dig> ’-dipyridyl could partially induce and 200 μm was the preferable inducer concentration to fully switch on ptpfhua <dig> expression system and to minimize the harmful effect of the inducer on e. coli growth.

in order to see the time response of ptpfhua <dig> by which it is effectively turned on, gfp yields along with e. coli growth were detected. gfp expression in the ptpfhua1-bearing culture was continuously increased until 9 h post induction . during the first 1 h induction, the relative fluorescence value increased by  <dig>  folds, which meant the expression circuit had been switched on. afterwards, the gfp expression increased very slowly from  <dig> to 5 h, and underwent a jump from  <dig> to 9 h. at last, the gfp expression achieved its peak at 9 h post induction, corresponding to the beginning of stationary phase in e. coli growth. thus, the whole expression circle for pfhua <dig> lasted for 9 h. in other side, the gfp synthesis always lagged behind the e. coli growth. this is desirable in toxic gene expression to reduce the damage of protein products to cells.

toxic protein expression under the control of modified pfhua1
based on the tight regulatory control in gfp expression, the potential of pypfhua <dig> in clone and expression of highly toxic gene products need to be verified. first, in order to check whether the basal expressions from pfhua <dig> in different copy numbered vectors would allow the highly toxic protein synthesis in e. coli, put , putb , and puta   <cit>  were used as the back plasmids in toxic gene expression. experimentally, toxic gene was inserted into the back plasmids with high-, middle- and low- copy number origins. here the lysis gene of e. coli phage φx <dig>  e, was selected as toxic gene, and its trace expression could induce lysis by formation of a transmembrane tunnel structure in the cell envelope of e. coli <cit> . 200 μm  <dig> ’-dipyridyl as the optimal dose was added into lb medium for induction. as shown in figure 4a, the similar growths of the strains bearing ptpfhua1e, pbpfhua1e and papfhua1e were observed as the control strain in medium with repressor. because of extreme sensibility of e. coli to e protein  <cit> , the normal growth of these strains indicated the tight control of pfhua <dig> activity in different copy-numbered vectors under the repression condition. however, under the induction conditions, their behaviors were diverse from each other. after top10/ptpfhua1e, top10/pbpfhua1e and top10/papfhua1e were induced at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  od <dig>  the highest od <dig>  was achieved  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  h later, and the lowest od <dig>  appeared at  <dig>   <dig>  and 7 h post induction, respectively. the differences of lysis performances caused by e protein production reflected the copy-number variant of vectors bearing pfhua <dig>  sorting from fast to slow, although three strains with ptpfhua1e, pbpfhua1e, and papfhua1e lysed in  <dig>   <dig>  and 7 h, respectively, their lysis kinetics were in similar mode. this kind of typical lysis curves indicated that e expression was under a controllable promoter. as a result, pfhua <dig> is tight enough to regulate high toxic gene expression in different copy-number vectors.

with the successful application of pypfhua <dig> in the regulation of e gene expression, its broad availability was the next concern. then, other two toxic proteins were synthesized using pypfhua <dig> in e. coli host. the gef encoding gef of e. coli belongs to the hok killer gene family in gram-negative bacteria and its expression kills the cell from the inside by interfering with a vital function in the cell membrane  <cit> . the mazf from a toxin-antitoxin module mazef specifies a stable toxin that cleaves mrna at a specific site which is responsible for programmed cell death in e. coli <cit> . here patpfhua <dig> was used, which is a middle-low-copy number vector with ~ <dig> copies per cell  <cit> . colony forming units  of the transformants were detected in the presence of inducer . comparing with the negative control top <dig>  all the recombinant strains were grown similarly in the presence of iron , and no leaky expression phenotype was appeared. however, the growth of top10/patpfhua1gef and top10/patpfhua1mazf was repressed when cultured with  <dig> ’-dipyridyl as the result of gef and mazf expression. at 0 h,  <dig> ’-dipyridyl was added. during the first 2 h after induction, all three strains performed to adapt the iron-limiting condition and maintained in a similar density of 109 cfu/ml. however, after 2 h, their growth behaviors were obviously different. top <dig> strain grew fast to  <dig> × <dig> cfu/ml in exponential way until 9 h post induction. however, the strains top10/patpfhua1gef and top10/patpfhua1mazf grew exponentially until 7 h post induction and then kept at 6× <dig> cfu/ml and 1× <dig> cfu/ml, respectively. therefore, the growth repression shown by recombinant strains revealed that toxic genes gef and mazf were functionally expressed after induction under the control of pfhua <dig>  furthermore, pypfhua <dig> could be applied in different toxic gene expressions.

discussion
the wide variety of applications of recombinant proteins and genetically engineered e. coli signifies the increasing demand for varied regulatory circuits. the challenges of regulatory expression technology are multifaceted to meet the growing need, in terms of quantities, qualities, cost-effectiveness and some particular cases. when even a low level of gene expression is detrimental to bacterial growth, the expression system has to be tightly regulated and efficiently shut off in the absence of inducer. in this work, a modified fur-dependent and iron-limiting inducible expression system was constructed, which owns several prominent features and benefits that confers it an attractive and versatile expression system for highly toxic foreign protein synthesis. in this iron regulation system , abundant iron complexing with fur repressor binds to pfhua <dig> sequence to prevent rna polymerase contacting with the promoter region and to shut down the transcription. in the other side, without enough iron, fur is disassociated from the fur box of pfhua <dig> sequence to open a place for rna polymerase and to switch on the expression of downstream gene. this system is inducible by iron chelator addition. most of all, the induction ratio was improved via enhancing the binding capacity between the repressor fur and pfhua <dig>  which made the system was tight enough to express different kinds of lethal genes in e. coli. as shown in figure 5b, the ultimate plasmid was named as pypfhua <dig>  according to different purposes of more or less recombinant protein needed, y site could be replaced by high or low copy-numbered origin. although the increased copy number of those vectors might cause higher levels of leaky expression, it was proved that high-copied ptpfhua <dig> could successfully express highly toxic gene, such as e in e. coli. besides, the exact pfhua <dig> sequence and key regions of the plasmid were also shown. a strong rrnbt1t <dig> terminator derived from the rrnb rrna operon of e. coli located at downstream of multi-cloning sites. taken together, when designing these vectors for toxic gene expression, the following properties had to be taken into account: a strong promoter capable of tightly regulation, strong terminators against read-through transcription from other plasmid-borne promoters, and different copy numbered origins of replication for gene expression with different degrees of toxicity. in all, this system is easily inducible, tightly controllable and potentially versatile for biotechnological application.

one of the most notable merits for this system is its tight regulation by iron-limitation signal. escolar et al. once pointed out that the actual sequences recognized by fur consisted of a minimal array of three conserved 6 bp  units which could be extended laterally by discrete additions of repeats of the same unit, thereby giving rise to new sites to which the repressor binds with a range of affinities  <cit> . it was assumed that the affinity would vary depending on both the number of repeats present on each operator and the conservation of their sequences, which would allow an entire range and hierarchy of transcription responses depending on small changes in the iron status in the cell  <cit> . based on this hypothesis, we designed three types of fur boxes differing in sequence conservation and 6-bp unit repeat number. it was found that the more repeats of conserved 6-bp units or the more conserved fur box, the stronger affinity between fur and the promoter, which was following by the tighter promoter. this verified the hypothesis mentioned above. in another side, this strategy also provides a new way for modifying other inducible promoters. however, a problem in this strategy is that the transcription efficiency decreases along with the tightness improvement. this is in common, because most of the regulatory systems have an intrinsic limitation in the range of induction, and attempts to mutate promoters to reduce basal expression usually result in concomitant reduction of induced levels. to overcome this drawback, royo et al. used the nasf attenuator and the nasr-dependent anti-termination system from klebsiella oxytoca to construct a novel expression circuit which could conditionally prevent undesired transcription from any transcriptional initiation signal, while keeping induced levels intact  <cit> . this point of view gives us a new reference for further optimization of expression vector constructed here.

although iron is one of the most abundant elements on earth, in aerobic environments it is predominantly found as ferric oxides that are relatively insoluble at neutral ph, and thus, ionic ferric  concentrations are exceedingly low  <cit> . therefore, as an iron limitation responsive vector, pypfhua <dig> has great potential in developing ‘suicidal’ containment system for environmentally relevant application. furthermore, in our previous research, iron-limiting condition was verified as an in vivo stimulating signal, and promoters derived from iron uptake system could be induced in vivo <cit> . therefore, this means pfhua <dig> could be used in the construction of in vivo inducible antigen synthesis system, which could alleviate the toxicity or metabolic burden of the host strain and improve the immunogenicity for bacterial vector vaccine  <cit> . moreover, in vivo regulated and delayed attenuation strategy has been developed for maintaining the invasive abilities of bacterial vector to the greatest extent, such that the recombinant vaccine has the ability as virulent wild-type strain to reach effector lymphoid tissues before display of attenuation to preclude onset of any disease symptoms  <cit> . pypfhua <dig> could also be applied in construction of in vivo delayed attenuation vaccine. in all, pypfhua <dig> could be induced by iron chelators in medium, in vitro aerobic environments and in vivo animal host, and has extensive application in biotechnology area.

CONCLUSIONS
in all, as the expression vector particularly developed for toxic protein synthesis, pypfhua <dig> owns its notable advantages, which include easy control, tight regulation, relatively high efficiency and multi-environments response potential. consequently, pypfhua <dig> has great potential in functional study of toxic genes, construction of biological containment system, or bacterial vector vaccine development.
