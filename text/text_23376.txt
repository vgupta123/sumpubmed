BACKGROUND
in contrast to wild species that typically evolved phenotypes over a long period of natural selection, domesticates rapidly gained human-preferred agronomic traits under a relatively short-time frame via artificial selection. under domesticated conditions, it is often to see many obtained traits instable to environmental alteration. the mechanisms underlying these distinct phenomena are not a new issue—as far back as the 1860s, with no knowledge of mendelian genetics, darwin speculated such mechanisms underlying the environment-induced changes  <cit> , and in the extreme, this conjecture fits lamarck’s idea of acquired inheritance. while under many circumstances epigenetically influenced agronomic traits are not so stable as to genetically controlled ones  <cit> , many case studies have shown that epigenetic alterations could promptly respond to environmental signals independent of genetic bases  <cit>  and differentially methylated alleles could lead to heritable phenotypic changes across generations  <cit> , including some agronomically important traits  <cit> . therefore, as suggested by hauden et al.  <cit> , we suspect that epigenetic changes might partially account for phenotypic adaptation to the rapid artificial selection.

silkworms have a relatively short history of domestication,  but show dramatic phenotypic changes. genetic divergence between the two species is, of course, an important mechanism of this evolution, which has been assessed by xia et al.  <cit> . for the ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> million single-nucleotide polymorphisms they identified in domesticated and wild silkworms, nearly 20% and 15% are species specific and majority of them exist in both species. similar pattern was also found for indels. totally  <dig> % of the domesticated silkworm genome was detected with selection signals  <cit> . these results indicate that, although the domesticated silkworms have maintained many genetic variations existing in wild silkworms, they have also clearly genetically differentiated from wild ones. besides the genetic divergence, whether epigenetic divergence play roles in silkworm domestication, is a new emerging issue in the era of epigenetics. due in large part to its comparatively small genome   <cit> , silkworms provide us a special opportunity to study possible dna methylation influence on domesticated animals in a manner that would be difficult in more genome-complicated animals that have been domesticated. although we recently demonstrated that methylation in silkworm genes is positively correlated with gene expression levels  <cit> , it is still an enigma if the only two dna methyltransferase  existing in silkworms are functional. in insect it has been thought that dna methylation doesn’t function because in the long-term insect model organism drosophila there is only dnmt <dig> and dna methylation seems not functional  <cit> . recently kucharski et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that honeybees have complete dna methyltransferase set  and knock-down dnmt <dig>  one important methyltransferase in animals and plants  <cit> , can make majority of newly hatched larvae emerged as queens, suggesting functional importance of honeybee dnmt <dig>  however, functionality of the more widely distributed dnmt <dig> , which is essential for developmental normality and critically required for transgenerational stability of mammals’ and plants’ epigenomes  <cit> , remains unknown in insects.

RESULTS
to explore the possible evolution role of dna methylation, we first test if the two silkworm dna methyltransferase genes , have biological function. here using rna interference  we found experimental evidence that dnmt <dig> is important to embryo development. injections of double strand rna  of dnmt <dig> and dnmt <dig>  respectively to ~ 8 h eggs led to down regulation of their expression level . as negative control, injection of gfp  dsrna had no obvious effect on the amount dnmt <dig> and dnmt <dig> mrnas. we found that dnmt <dig> embryonic rnai resulted in a significant decrease in hatching rate while dnmt <dig> rnai did not have this effect . the result of dnmt <dig> suggests a functional importance of this methyltransferase in silkworm embryonic development, congruent with findings on both plants and mammals  <cit> . as to dnmt <dig>  one possibility is that dnmt <dig> doesn’t have functional effect to the embryo development, or our rnai didn’t work. but it is also possible that because the basal expression of this gene is too low as indicated by figure 1b, rnai knockdown may not have obvious effect on the hatching rate of silkworm eggs. further efforts to completely knockout dnmt <dig> may be able to provide solid evidence on the functionality of dnmt <dig> 

based on this finding as well as our previous observation that dna methylation level is positively correlated with gene expression in silkworms  <cit> , our study is extended to the more complex issue of possible epigenetic influences to silkworm domestication. we conducted a comprehensive methylome comparison of silk glands between three domesticated and four wild silkworms. besides using the previously reported dazao strain’s methylome  <cit> , we used the methylc-seq technology  <cit>  to reveal the silk gland methylomes of other two strains of domesticated silkworms  and four wild, geographically different silkworms. dazao and c <dig> are reserved strains and jingsong  is a well-known high silk production strain, while the four wild silkworms were collected from four different geographic areas : sichuan , shaanxi , yunnan  provinces and shanghai , among which sichuan and shaanxi are speculated to be the key origins of domesticated silkworms according to current historical records  <cit> . information of all individual samples is shown in additional file 2: table s <dig>  our deep sequencing of bisulfite-treated dnas yielded  <dig>  gb ~  <dig>  gb effective data for the two domesticated silkworms and  <dig>  gb ~  <dig>  gb for the four wild silkworms , resulting in  <dig>  ~  <dig>  ×,  <dig>  ~  <dig> × coverage per strand and 67 ~ 81%, 77 ~ 80% genomic cytosines covered by effective reads in domesticated and wild silkworms, respectively .

previously, we showed that the silkworm has a sparse methylation genome and cytosines in non-cg contexts are barely methylated  <cit> . we accordingly referred to our previous procedures  <cit>  to call methylated cgs  in each sample and included our published silk gland methylome of the domesticated strain dazao  <cit>  in the domesticated samples. out of all cgs with high-quality sequencing support,  <dig>  ~  <dig>  and  <dig>  ~  <dig>  were found to be methylated in domesticated and wild silkworms, respectively . cg sites covered in both wild and domesticated silkworms  were selected to call for differentially methylated cgs  and conserved methylated cgs  between species. mcgs covered in both the species, are  <dig>  ~  <dig>  in domesticated silkworms and  <dig>  ~  <dig>  in wild silkworms based on our stringent criterion  to identify cmcs and dmcs, totally we identified  <dig>  cmcs and  <dig> dmgs, among which  <dig>  dmcs are in domesticated silkworms and  <dig>  in wild ones. it is notable that cmcs and dmcs are totally less than 1/ <dig> of the mcgs identified for each samples, and thus large proportion of mcgs do not consistently exist within species, suggesting that, like genetic polymorphism  <cit> , dna methylation also shows substantial within-species variation. we observed  <dig>  dmcs in domesticated silkworms but only  <dig>  in wild ones. the 2-fold more dmcs in domesticated silkworms may possibly reflect a trend of increasing dna methylation during silkworm domestication. another domesticated species, chickens, also show higher methylation levels than their wild ancestors  <cit> . whether this is a general phenomenon during domestication is an interesting issue to investigate in more domesticated organisms.

in contrast to arabidopsis thaliana, in which te and other repeats show conserved methylation while genic especially coding sequences  methylation are much more variable either among natural populations or generations  <cit> , here we observed that methylation in cds and smrna loci in silkworms are apparently conserved between the domesticated and wild silkworms, but tes and introns bear more methylation differences between the two species . consistently, dmcs are significantly enriched in introns   and in tes   compared to in cds . we used the ant methylome data to test enrichment of dmcs in intron and tes compared to cds in two ant species  <cit>  and found similar pattern both in camponotus floridanus  and  <dig> dmcs vs  <dig> cmcs in tes  compared to  <dig> dmcs vs  <dig> cmcs in cds) and in harpegnathos saltator  and in  <dig> dmcs vs  <dig> cmcs in tes  compared to  <dig> dmcs vs  <dig> cmcs in cds). the results suggest dna methylation in tes and introns may be more dynamic than cds in insect species.

we further plotted mcg profiles in the context of gene regions  and their 2 kb up- and downstream regions. distribution of cmcs is similar to our previous results  <cit> , higher genic but lower up- and down-stream methylation, with boundaries between gene bodies and flanking sequences showing a sharp drop . notably, within each regions cmcs are evenly distributed  while densities of dmcs show drastic fluctuation across each tested region , perhaps reflecting the regulatory nature of those dmcs.

difference pattern in conserved and variable methylated functional regions between plants  and insects such as silkworms and ants may indicate that, in contrast to plants where stable dna methylation for controlling activities of tes is more important  <cit> , in insects, maintaining methylation status in genic regions rather than tes seems predominant  <cit> , possibly because the functional role of dna methylation in silkworms is mainly in genic regions. indeed the functional significance of genic region methylation has been reported and three explanatory mechanisms have been proposed, e.g. keeping accurate transcription  <cit> , regulating alternative splicing  <cit>  or alternative promoter silencing  <cit> , whether these hypothetical explanatory mechanisms are able to address the above phenomena observed in insects requires further experimental evidence.

in total, dmcs are located in  <dig> gene bodies,  <dig> upstream and  <dig> downstream 2 kb regions of genes. usually mcgs clustered in a certain region are more likely to have functional implications than single mcg, we further screened for dmc clusters, at a cutoff of  <dig> dmcs within a 250 bp interval considering sparse mcs in silkworms   <cit> . this kind of dmc clusters was found in  <dig> upstream,  <dig> downstream regions and  <dig> gene bodies . we refer to these regions as gene-related differentially methylated regions .

due to considerable epigenetic instability, gain or loss of dna methylation is common compared to dna mutations, which are usually irreversible  <cit> . the heritable and even fixed epimutations during domestication are thus awash with prompt but reversible epigenetic changes. we therefore decided to further test more domesticated and wild samples in order to find fixed dmr. we collected four more domesticated silkworm strains  and three more geographically different varieties of wild silkworms from gansu , zhejiang  and jiangsu  province of china . unfortunately, checking all the  <dig> dmrs with loci-specific bisulfite pcr and sequencing  for these individuals is too costly, so we randomly chose  <dig> regions to subject to bisulfite pcr amplification followed by  <dig> deep sequencing, using the barcoded primers . in total, from  <dig> out of these  <dig> regions , we successfully obtained effective  <dig> sequencing data in at least three new domesticated and two new wild samples, among which  <dig> regions were covered by sequencing data across all the samples. as to the rest  <dig> regions, although all of them were successfully amplified in domesticated silkworms and  <dig> out of them had effective sequencing data in at least  <dig> new domesticated samples, only  <dig> regions could be amplified in only one new wild sample, leaving us with a lack of informative sequencing data in wild silkworms for these  <dig> regions. failure of sufficient amplification in wild samples may be due to mutations in primer binding regions.

among the  <dig> dmrs,  <dig> have consistent dmc clusters between at least two new individuals of both domesticated and wild silkworms, suggesting general fixation of the five dmc clusters. the  <dig> dmrs include: the upstream regions of bgibmga <dig> ; introns of bgibmga <dig> , bgibmga <dig> and bgibmga002594; and exon of bgibmga <dig> . bgibmga <dig> is of particular interest as all the tested  <dig> cgs in the dmc cluster at its upstream region show fixed demethylation in domesticated silkworms. it is noteworthy that because dna methylation is usually cell/cell type specific, we didn’t observed 100% methylation level at the  <dig> cgs in wild silkworms . fine mapping of the dmc cluster indicated that they are just 200 bp upstream of the coding sequences, which could be in 5′utr or promoter . interestingly, bgibmga <dig> had been identified to be a candidate silkworm domestication gene in a genomic region of selective signal   <cit> . we conducted more analyses to assess whether the selective sweep in this region is caused by key genetic, or epi-mutations, or even both. to test the genetic mutation, we carefully checked snps in bgibmga <dig> using the available snp data of  <dig> domesticated and wild silkworms  and found that all the four snps detected in cds are synonymous differences and thus do not change the protein sequence . the evolutionary process of this gene might thus affect its expression, by affecting on regulatory elements. as expected, bgibmga <dig> shows lower silk gland expression level in the tested domesticated silkworms than the wild ones . to test genetic mutations of its upstream regulatory regions, we also used the released snp data  and found  <dig> snps in the upstream 2 kb region of bgibmga <dig> showing obvious different frequencies between domesticated and wild silkworms . we further sequenced the region covering the  <dig> snps of all the tested domesticated and wild silkworms and interestingly, all the tested domesticated and wild silkworms are of the same genotype in this tested region . therefore, the differential expression of the gene between wild and domesticated silkworms is less likely to be caused by genetic mutations in the tested regulatory sequences, indicating that the fixed epigenetic difference is likely to be the cause of the bgibmga <dig> expression change during silkworm domestication. this finding bears very important evolution significance by indicating that selective sweep may be able to act on epimuations. bgibmga <dig> is homologous to drosophila cg <dig>  which was supposed by domain analysis to have the molecular function of metal ion binding and phosphoric diester hydrolase activity. how this function was selected by humans needs more functional studies.

the other four genes were not in the domestication gene list proposed previously  <cit> . unlike bgibmga <dig>  the tested dmc clusters within these genes were all proved to have generally higher methylation level in domesticated silkworms . among the four genes, bgibmga <dig> showed overall silk gland overexpression in domesticated silkworms compared to wild ones , and microarray analysis of 5th instar larvae of dazao strain  indicate its higher expression in the silk gland . bgibmga <dig> is homologous to the drosophila icln gene. icln is a multifunctional protein that is essential for cell volume regulation  <cit> , which invokes a very interesting correlation between its high expression level and enlargement of silk gland in domesticated silkworms.

we did not observe obvious expression changes for the other three genes . bgibmga <dig> is a silkworm adenylate kinase  gene. adk catalyzes the reversible phosphoryl transfer from adenosine triphosphates  to adenosine monophosphates  and to yield adenosine diphosphates . bgibmga <dig> and bgibmga <dig> have no functional clue. the former has a wd- <dig> repeat and the latter has a tetraspanin domain, both of which are found in diverse proteins.

we tested genetic divergence in these genes between the domesticated and wild silkworms by analyzing snps identified from the methylc-seq data in this study and didn’t detect obvious fixed different snps between the tested domesticated and wild silkworms . as for the effect of dna methylation on gene expression, it seems that epigenetic changes might also be associated with expression changes for the bgibmga <dig> gene. however, we didn’t observe expression changes for other three genes, which may indicate that their dna methylation differentiation may not have caused change of gene expression levels.

we only tested  <dig> regions out of  <dig> gene-related dmrs identified through comparative methylomics between the  <dig> domesticated and  <dig> wild silkworms, and found one dmr has evolved fixed methylation difference while  <dig> others have largely evolved methylation difference between domesticated and wild silkworms. extrapolating from these proportions, there may be  <dig> strictly fixed and  <dig> generally differentially methylated regions at the whole genome level between domesticated and wild silkworms. compared to  <dig> genes strongly selected by humans during silkworm domestication  <cit> , dna methylation-differentiated loci during domestication are very limited. understandably, such a reversible epigenetic change may not be able to account for large scale phenotypic evolution, whether under domesticated or natural conditions. it is, however, plausible that some epigenetic changes may provide a trajectory for evolution of new traits  <cit> , especially for quick responsive adaptation. thus artificial selection might act on epigenomes to acquire human-preferred traits  <cit> . in mammals, reprogramming  of methylation pattern takes place during two developmental stages in germ cells and in preimplantation embryos  <cit> , whereas in plant germline cells, cg and chg methylation are usually maintained and only chg methylation is reprogrammed  <cit> , which may allow transmitting responsive dna methylation changes to the next generation with higher chance in plants. even in mammals, transgenerational inheritance of epialleles has also been reported  <cit> . in insects, before fertilization, one oocyte is divided into one germline cell and seven nurse cells, which are similar to plants but different from a mammalian oocyte. accordingly, although insects have multitude lower methylation, if their germline reprogramming process is like that in plants, epialleles are still more likely to be transmitted to the next generation.

CONCLUSIONS
though much future research is needed to provide additional experimental evidence that can confirm our observation regarding epigenetic divergences and their possible contribution during silkworm domestication, our study has provided highly suggestive experimental evidence on the functional importance of the epigenetic system in silkworm and candidate genes that might be associated with epigenetic changes during domestication. further functional exploration of these genes may lend vital evidence regarding the role of epigenetic contribution in artificial selection. in addition, this study has also given impetus to the case for dnmt1’s role in dna methylation in insects.
