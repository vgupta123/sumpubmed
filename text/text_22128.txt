BACKGROUND
belgian blue cattle  are famous for their exceptional muscular development referred to as “double-muscling” . bbc derive from a dual-purpose breed that roamed southern belgium in the beginning of the twentieth century. although a small population  of dual-purpose animals corresponding to this ancestral “race de moyenne et haute belgique” still exists , intense selection for increased muscle mass, driven by premiums paid for double-muscled carcasses and enabled by the systematization of artificial insemination  in the sixties, led to the fixation - in less than 20 years  - of what has become the defining feature of the new bbc breed. it was demonstrated  that the rapid metamorphosis that affected bbc between ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> was largely due to the fixation of a loss-of-function mutation  in the myostatin  gene. mstn encodes a “chalone”  controlling the growth of skeletal muscle in wild-type individuals .figure  <dig>

it is generally not appreciated, however, that  the heritability of muscular development remained as high as 30-45% in bbc after fixation of the p.d273rfsx <dig> mstn allele, and  that this residual genetic variation has been exploited to further increase muscle mass of bbc. that homozygosity for the p.d273rfsx <dig> mstn variant only accounts for part of the spectacular muscular hypertrophy of modern bbc is also obvious from the comparison of their carcass scores with that of present-day bbm animals that are homozygous for the p.d273rfsx <dig> mstn mutation .

in this paper, we aimed to define the nature of the genetic determinants underpinning the second wave  of muscle growth witnessed in bbc. did it involve the rapid fixation of one or more mutations with effects of a magnitude similar to the p.d273rfsx <dig> mstn mutation? are quantitative trait loci  with large effects on muscle mass segregating in present-day bbc? or is the residual heritability for muscle mass in present-day bbc largely polygenic or “quasi-infinitesimal”?

RESULTS
to address the first question  we aimed at identifying genomic regions characterized by  reduced genetic variability  in “modern” bbc , and  high genetic differentiation  with “old” bbc , bbm, and holstein-friesian  animals. hf were selected as controls because they are of dairy type, yet are phylogenetically closely related to bbc . we genotyped   <dig> “modern” bbc,   <dig> “old” bbc ,   <dig> animals from the dual-purpose bbm subpopulation, and   <dig> dutch hf sires, with the illumina bovinehd array interrogating >700 k single nucleotide polymorphisms  dispersed across the genome. we first identified regions of low heterozygosity using a previously reported hidden markov model  implemented with the “sweepy” program  <cit> . we identified a total of  <dig> candidate regions exhibiting reduced variability in modern bbc . three of these departed clearly from the bulk by their larger size :  a  <dig> kb segment on chromosome bta <dig> spanning the extension locus  affecting coat color  <cit> ,  a  <dig> kb segment on bta <dig> encompassing plag <dig> known to affect stature in cattle  <cit> , and  a  <dig> kb segment on bta <dig> containing mstn . the mc1r and plag <dig> regions were also characterized by signatures of reduced variability in old bbc, bbm and hf . the corresponding signatures are assumed to be genuine and to result from selection for black-based coat color and increased stature. the mstn region exhibited a signature of reduced variability in old bbc, but not in bbm and hf. the region was highly differentiated between bbc on the one hand, and bbm and hf on the other hand. this was exactly as expected for a selective sweep accompanying the dissemination of double-muscling in bbc as a result of the fixation of the p.d273rfsx <dig> mstn variant. of the  <dig> remaining  regions, only three were differentiated with respect to bbm and hf, and two with respect to hf only . however, none of the candidate regions exhibited noticeable levels of differentiation with old bbc, bbm and hf, as would be expected for a genuine selective sweep that would have occurred in modern bbc. taken together, these results do not support the fixation of an allele with major effect on muscularity in bbc during the second wave of muscle growth.figure  <dig>

to provide a response to the second question , we performed a genome-wide association study  for muscularity in modern bbc. in addition to the  <dig> old and  <dig> modern bbc sires used to detect signatures of selection , we genotyped  <dig> sires born between  <dig> and  <dig> with the illumina bovinehd array, for a total of  <dig> genotyped bbc sires. all were ai sires and  <dig> of them had recorded offspring . the phenotypes used for gwas were twice the “daughter trait deviations”  for five categorical traits pertaining to muscular development: general muscularity , muscularity of the back , muscularity of the shoulder , muscularity of the rump  , and muscularity of the rump  . association analyses were conducted using a previously described haplotype-based method  <cit> .

the likelihood ratio test  exceeded the genome-wide significance threshold  at a single genomic location  for gm and bm. the same chromosomal region clearly affected sm, rmr and rms as well, although the corresponding effects were not genome-wide significant. the observed signal was primarily driven by one haplotype  increasing muscle mass. the qtl explained between  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the total additive genetic variance  . we noticed that the most likely positions of the qtl flanked the mrc <dig> gene . we previously reported that loss-of-function mutations  in the mrc <dig> gene cause crooked-tail syndrome  in homozygotes/compound heterozygotes and are associated with increased muscle mass and decreased height in heterozygotes in bbc  <cit> . of note, ahap <dig> was likewise associated with a decrease in height in our dataset . we genotyped the  <dig> bbc sires for the corresponding mrc <dig> mutations. twenty four and  <dig>  percent of the bulls were carriers for the c.2904-2905delag and c.1906 t > c mutations, respectively, in agreement with previous estimates. linkage disequilibrium between ahap <dig> and the c.2904-2905delag variant was  <dig>   or  <dig>  . this indicates that the more common c.2904-2905delag mutation is virtually exclusively encountered on the ahap <dig> haplotype, but that mutation-free versions of the latter also exist. we added mrc <dig> genotype to the association model and showed that it had a major effect on all muscularity phenotypes as expected . statistical significance  of the residual haplotype effects in the bta <dig>  <dig> - <dig>  mb interval dropped severely for gm, bm, and sm, but remained as high as  <dig>  and  <dig>  for rmr and rms. this suggests that the mrc <dig> variants accounts for most if not the entire qtl effect on gm, bm and sm, but that other variants with more modest effects on rmr and rms may exist in this chromosomal region .figure  <dig>

in addition to the bta <dig> qtl, the initial genome scan revealed four signals exceeding the genome-wide suggestive threshold , respectively on chromosomes bta <dig> , bta <dig> , bta <dig>  and bta <dig>  . we rescanned the entire genome, including mrc <dig> genotype in the model. the second bta <dig> qtl  became genome-wide significant for gm, rmr and rms. the effect was largely driven by a single haplotype  increasing muscle mass. it explained between  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the additive genetic variance . the remaining three qtl remained suggestive .figure  <dig>

to provide additional evidence that the two genome-wide significant qtl on bta <dig> contributed to the increase in muscle mass experienced by bbc since  <dig>  we examined the evolution of their allelic frequency during the corresponding time lapse. the frequency of the mrc <dig> c.2904-2905delag variant increased from ~ <dig>  for bulls born before  <dig> to ~ <dig>  for those born between  <dig> and  <dig> . for the proximal bta <dig> qtl , the frequency of the ahap <dig> haplotype increased from ~ <dig>  for bulls born before  <dig> to ~ <dig>  for bulls born during the 2000- <dig> interval . to evaluate the significance of these changes, we compared them with the changes undergone during the same period by all variants with a frequency of  <dig>  prior to  <dig> or haplotypes with a frequency of  <dig>  prior to  <dig>  the increases in frequency of both the c.2904-2905delag variant and ahap <dig> haplotype exceeded the corresponding 99th percentiles , hence suggesting that they were driven by selection.figure  <dig>

we next addressed the last question, i.e. of the importance of the polygenic or quasi-infinitesimal component of muscularity in bbc. when adding the mrc <dig> genotype as fixed effects and the four significant or suggestive qtls as random effects in a mixed model including a random animal effect, we estimated that the residual polygenic variation accounted for 76%  to 92%  of the additive genetic variation. to gain additional insight in the molecular architecture of this polygenic component, we evaluated the performances of “genomic selection” models  as fixed effects) differing in their prior assumptions regarding the distribution of polygenic effects. while gblup  <cit>  assumes that the effects of all snps are drawn from the same normal distribution, bayesb  <cit>  and bayesr  <cit>  assume that the majority of snps have no effect, while effects of the remainder are either drawn from student's t-distributions  or from a mixture of three normal distribution . in a cross-validation design, gblup performed as good or better than the bayesian models . this strongly suggests that the residual component of the additive variance is in essence quasi-infinitesimal with a largely uniform distribution of polygenic effect. indeed, hayes et al.  <cit>  and daetwyler et al.  <cit>  showed that for traits with a proportion of moderate to large effects, models such as bayesb tended to perform better than gblup.table  <dig>

discussion
we herein analyze the genetic underpinnings of the muscular hypertrophy that has continued to augment in bbc after fixation of the p.d273rfsx <dig> mstn variant around  <dig>  we have not obtained convincing evidence of the fixation of alleles with major effect on muscle mass  in modern bbc between  <dig> and the present. this is unlikely due to a lack of power as three convincing signatures of selection, corresponding to previously described major gene effects, were successfully identified. these involve respectively  the fixation of the mstn p.d273rfsx <dig> mutation in  bbc marked by a ~ <dig> kb segment of reduced variation and high differentiation,  the fixation of the mc1r p.l99p mutation in  bbc, bbm and hf, underlying the shared, breed-defining dominant black color of the pigmented hairs, and marked by a ~ <dig> kb segment of reduced variation,  the fixation of a previously characterized haplotype spanning plag <dig> in  bbc, bbm and hf, associated with a major positive effect on stature  <cit> , and marked by a ~ <dig> kb segment of reduced variation. that selection underlies the fixation of the mstn p.d273rfsx <dig> mutation in  bbc and the mc1r p.l99p mutation in  bbc, bbm and hf is obvious. selection is also very likely to underlie the segment of reduced genetic variation encompassing plag <dig>  the present-day standard shoulder height is >  <dig> cms for several breeds, including hf and bbc, while it was only ~ <dig> cms in the 11th century  <cit> . increasing stature has been a declared selection objective in several breeds during the last 50 years as it was a corollary of increased productivity, and this would have expectedly lead to the fixation of the stature-enhancing plag <dig> allele in these breeds  <cit> . it is worth noting that the same chromosome region was shown to affect other traits of economic importance, including fertility, food intake or fat depth  <cit> . these pleiotropic effects might also have contributed to the fixation of the corresponding haplotype. we detected two segregating qtl by gwas, which explain up to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of genetic variation for muscularity traits, respectively. both qtl are located on bta <dig> and appear each to involve one “q allele” embedded in a unique haplotype . the distal bta <dig> qtl seems to be largely driven by the mrc <dig> c.2904-2905delag variant shown previously to cause cts in homozygotes. indeed, the c.2904-2905delag variant is in complete ld  with ahap <dig>  and fitting c.2904-2905delag as a covariate in the model completely annihilates the qtl signal for gm, bm and sm. independent evidence supporting the causality of the mrc <dig> gene are  the allelic heterogeneity of cts in bbc, and  the known role of mrc <dig> in bone formation. we detected two independent mrc <dig> loss-of-function mutations causing cts: c.2904-2905delag and c.1906 t > c
 <cit> . such allelic heterogeneity for genetic defects is very unusual in livestock populations that are typically characterized by effective population sizes <  <dig>  we surmise that breeders have unwittingly selected both deleterious mrc <dig> mutations because of their visible and desirable effect on muscularity and stature in heterozygotes  <cit> . mrc <dig> is an endocytic collagen receptor that plays an essential role in remodeling the extracellular matrix required during bone growth. accordingly, the length of long bones, including tibia and femur, is reduced in mrc <dig> knock-out mice  <cit> . that the mrc <dig> c.2904-2905delag and c.1906 t > c directly affect stature is thus very likely. their apparent effect on muscularity could therefore just reflect a change in the ratio of muscle mass  to skeleton size . despite the strong evidence supporting the causality of the mrc <dig> loss-of-function variant, it is worth noting that adding the c.2904-2905delag in the model did not completely eliminate the qtl effects on rmr and rms. this suggests that other, as of yet unidentified variants affecting muscularity might exist in this genomic region.

our molecular understanding of the proximal bta <dig> qtl is much more rudimentary. mining available genome-wide resequencing data for  <dig> bbc sires , did not reveal any striking mutation associated with the ahap <dig> haplotype that might underlie the qtl. it is worthwhile noting, however, that the two bta <dig> qtl appear to affect different body segments. the distal qtl  primarily affects bm and height, while the proximal qtl  primarily affects rm. this suggests that different molecular pathways are recruited to control the growth of distinct muscle groups.

assuming that the two bta <dig> qtl are genuine, the corresponding “q” alleles should undergo a selective sweep in the bbc population as a result of the intense selection for increased muscularity. we previously demonstrated that the proportion of present-day offspring of précieux  is much too large to be explained by mendelian segregation in the corresponding pedigree alone. based on these data, we estimated that carriers of the mrc <dig> c.2904-2905delag had nearly twice as much chance to be selected as elite sires than their non-carrier sibs  <cit> . in this work, we extended this analysis for the two bta <dig> qtl. we compared the magnitude of the increase in frequency between  <dig> and  <dig> for the mrc <dig> c.2904-2905delag variant and the ahap <dig> haplotype, with that of control variants/haplotypes matched for population frequency in  <dig>  during this period, the frequency of the mrc <dig> c.2904-2905delag variant increased by 16% and that of the ahap <dig> haplotype by 26%. both values exceeded the corresponding 99th percentile, hence supporting the selective sweep hypothesis. the 16% increase of the c.2904-2905delag variant is even more remarkable as it is lethal in homozygotes which would have caused counterselection. further increase of the frequency of the mrc <dig> c.2904-2905delag variant would probably have stalled, as the proportion of affected homozygotes would have augmented. such balancing selection now appears to be relatively common in livestock  <cit> . paradoxically, knowledge of the underlying causative mutations may lead to the further increase in frequency of the corresponding variants, as it will be possible to avoid at risk matings by marker assisted selection. unless the ahap9-associated q allele of the  <dig>  mb bta <dig> qtl also has pleiotropic deleterious effects, and provided that selection for increased muscularity remains the norm, it will likely continue to increase in frequency in bbc until reaching fixation in a few decades. as we have neither observed a depletion in homozygotes for the ahap <dig> haplotype, nor detected obvious loss-of-function variants in the immediate vicinity of the  <dig>  mb bta <dig> qtl , we have no reasons to suspect that such associated deleterious effects might exist.

the fact the “q” alleles of the two bta <dig> qtl were embedded in a single haplotype suggests that the corresponding causative mutations were young and selected for as soon as they appeared in the population. detectable phenotypic effects of both mutations in heterozygotes would have facilitated the corresponding sweeps. if the corresponding mutations had been old, they would have had time to recombine into multiple haplotype backgrounds. intense selection for increased muscle mass would then have increased the frequency of the causative mutations, and with these the frequency of not only one  but of multiple haplotypes. in such case, multiple haplotype states would have been associated with increased muscle mass, rather than one as observed . an additional argument supporting the young age of the mrc <dig> c.2904-2905delag variant is its breed specificity: it has only been reported in bbc despite the full sequencing of several hundred individuals representing multiple breeds  <cit> . we acknowledge that we cannot fully exclude a scenario in which the causative mutations were in fact older, but that as a result of drift  one haplotype only ended up dominating the selective sweep.

one might a priori expect that the suggestive selective sweeps undergone by the ahap <dig> and ahap <dig> haplotypes would be accompanied by detectable signatures of selection specific for segregating sites . to that end, we evaluated the integrated haplotype score   <cit>  that searches for haplotypes that are unusually long given their population frequency. the signals obtained in the vicinity of the two bta <dig> qtl would not stand above the noise . this is likely due to the extensive use of ai, disseminating long-range haplotypes from popular sires in the population even in the absence of direct selection, to strong genetic drift in populations with small effective size or to the selection for other variants across the genome . these findings are in agreement with recent findings from kemper et al.  <cit>  who reported little evidence for association between strong selective sweeps and regions affecting complex traits under selection. thus, mapping signatures of selection may not be a very effective alternative to gwas for the identification of genomic regions influencing economically important traits, as the peculiar structure of livestock populations generates high background.

in addition to these two genome-wide significant bta <dig> qtl, we obtained suggestive evidence for three additional qtl for muscularity. taken together, these five qtl explain between  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the additive genetic variation. we herein provide evidence that the remaining  <dig> - <dig> % of the additive genetic variation is largely quasi-infinitesimal. indeed, gblup  performed as well as bayesian models  in predicting muscularity in cross-validation experiments. we attempted to characterize the polygenic architecture of muscularity from the direct output of the bayesian models . as the corresponding numbers did not differ significantly from those obtained with permuted phenotypes, they were considered unreliable with our limited data set , and cross-validation used instead.

thus, the genetic architecture of muscularity in modern bbc – a typical production trait subject to intense directional selection – involves  a handful of detectable qtl that individually explain of the order of 5%, and jointly of the order of  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the additive genetic variance , and  a quasi-infinitesimal polygenic tail of what are likely to be a very large number of variants with very small effects that would require immense sample size to be individualized. moreover, the data suggests that the detectable qtl might correspond to novel variants that appeared only recently in the population. evidence from qtl analyses of other production traits in livestock, including milk production and composition in cattle  <cit> , body size in cattle  <cit> , muscularity in pigs  <cit>  and sheep  <cit> , fertility in sheep  <cit> , etc., suggests that the same may apply to all these phenotypes. this “bivariate” composition, also pointed out by kemper and goddard  <cit> , seems to be in sharp contrast with findings from gwas conducted in humans. indeed, nearly all studied complex traits in humans appear to only comprise the quasi-infinitesimal/polygenic component . qtl accounting for 5% of the additive genetic variance are essentially unheard off in human genetics. on the contrary the adaptation of threespine sticklebacks to marine and freshwater environments  <cit>  appears also to have involved a small number of genes with large effects, a situation that appears reminiscent of the highly selected livestock populations. the biological reasons underlying this dichotomy remain largely unexplained, but it is tempting to speculate that it is related to the strong directional selection that applies to livestock populations and – in specific circumstances - to natural populations. our results support a model in which response to directional selection in domesticated species, involves  the rapid fixation  of a small number of variants with moderate to large phenotypic effects that sequentially arise in the population by mutation and may jointly account for > 10% of the genetic variance, and  slow and gradual changes in frequencies  of a large pool of variants with very small phenotypic effects, of which most have been segregating in the population for a long time  and jointly account for the bulk of the genetic variance.

CONCLUSIONS
contrary to complex traits in humans which have a near-exclusively polygenic architecture, muscle mass in beef cattle , appears to be controlled by  a handful of recent mutations with large effect that rapidly sweep through the population, and  a large number of presumably older variants with very small effects that rise slowly in the population .
