BACKGROUND
norepinephrine , a classic neurotransmitter in the sympathetic nervous system, is released from adrenergic varicosities of stimulated postganglionic nerve terminals, activates postjunctional α-adrenoceptors and gives rise to a slow membrane depolarization  and contraction  <cit> . the ne-induced smd represents an important mechanism of excitation-contraction coupling in blood vessels however the signaling pathways underlying the ne-elicited smd in vascular smooth muscle remain undefined.

one well-documented pathway downstream of activated g-protein coupled receptors  includes dissociation of gαβγ trimers and production of gα monomer and gβγ dimer, and involvement of the latter proteins in signal transduction events downstream of α-adrenoceptors. for example, gα mediates activation of phospholipase c , hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate , and generation of second messengers including inositol  <dig> ,5-triphosphate  and diacylglycerol, dag  <cit> . these second messengers then mediate signal transduction events leading to activation of ion channels. insp <dig> has the capacity to release cytosolic ca2+ from intracellular stores, which then activates ca2+-activated cl- channels  and membrane depolarization, required for opening of voltage-operated calcium channels  and ca2+ influx. dag, on the other hand, activates non-selective cation channels  in rabbit portal vein  <cit> . in addition, it becomes increasingly clear that gβγ dimers can initiate intracellular signal transduction events as well. phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-γ , a member of class ib pi3ks, was identified as a major effector of gβγ in various cell and tissue preparations  <cit> . lipid products of the pi3ks, phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate  and phosphatidylinositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate , function as second messengers and can directly affect the activity of the membrane ion channels cftr  <cit>  and voltage-gated potassium channels  <cit> . alternatively, pi <dig> p <dig> and pi <dig> ,5p <dig> can modulate membrane ion channels via activation of pkc isozymes  <cit> . for example, gβγ, pi3kγ, and atypical pkc were shown to link activation of g-protein coupled m2-muscarinic receptors to metabotropic ca2+ and voltage-independent cl- channels in xenopus oocytes  <cit> . it was also demonstrated that pi3k mediates activation of l-type ca2+ channels upon stimulation of m2-muscarinic receptors in rabbit portal vein myocytes  <cit>  and α2-adrenoceptor induced vasoconstriction in porcine palmar lateral vein  <cit> . these studies imply that activation of gpcrs could activate membrane ion channels and smd via pi3k-dependent mechanisms. to our knowledge, however, coupling of α-adrenoceptors to pi3kγ and membrane depolarization in vascular smooth muscles has not yet been reported.

we used canine isolated mesenteric vein to test the hypothesis that efs-induced smd is mediated by pi3k and pkc. our results demonstrate both nerve stimulation and exogenous ne-mediated activation of α2-adrenoceptors, pi3k and pkc, and suggest a role for these kinases for the activation of membrane ion channels  and development of smd.

RESULTS
α2-adrenoceptors mediate vasoconstriction and membrane depolarization in canine isolated mesenteric vein
cumulative application of exogenous ne and clonidine  resulted in concentration dependent contractile responses . in the presence of the selective α2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine  the contractile responses to  <dig> – <dig> μm ne were virtually abolished, whereas the responses to  <dig> and  <dig> μm ne were significantly reduced . yohimbine abolished the mechanical responses to all clonidine concentrations . these results indicate that α2-adrenoceptors are particularly important for ne-mediated vasoconstriction in this blood vessel. moreover, exogenous application of either ne  or clonidine  elicited smd, suggesting that α2-adrenoreceptors may be involved in the membrane potential changes in response to ne that is released upon efs.

efs gives rise to a biphasic membrane depolarization
the resting membrane potential of isolated canine mesenteric vein segments averaged - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv . efs  gave rise to a characteristic biphasic depolarization of the cell membrane , composed of a fast excitation junction potential  of presumed purinergic nature, and a smd of adrenergic origin. the amplitude of the smd increased with the frequency of efs . to better understand the processes that govern membrane depolarization, we exposed blood vessels to the fast na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin  or to the neuronal n-type ca2+ channel blocker ω-conotoxin gvia . both drugs virtually abolished the electrical responses to efs , suggesting that the efs-elicited smd requires activation of postganglionic nerve terminals and release of a neurotransmitter substance. phentolamine  significantly reduced the smd in response to  <dig>  hz efs to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv , consistent with the possibility that ne-mediated activation of α-adrenoceptors is the primary cause for the smd in blood vessels  <cit> . furthermore, the selective α2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine , but not the selective α1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin , significantly reduced the smd in response to  <dig>  hz efs from  <dig>  ±  <dig>   to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv , indicating that the efs-evoked smd is mediated primarily by α2-adrenoceptors. nicardipine  abolished the contraction elicited by  <dig> mm kcl , indicating that l-type ca2+ channels are present in this blood vessel. however, the efs-induced smd remained unchanged in tissues preincubated with nicardipine , suggesting that opening of l-type ca2+ channels is not required for the membrane depolarization.

the efs-induced slow membrane depolarization is sensitive to nfa, nppb, dids and gd3+
to test possible contribution of ion channels in the efs-induced smd, we incubated veins with the commonly used non-selective cation channel  and cl- channel inhibitors nfa , nppb , and dids   <cit> . these inhibitors reduced the  <dig>  hz efs-elicited smd by 73% , 92%  and 67% , respectively. dids also reduced the excitation junction potentials , which may be due to blockade of p2x receptors, as suggested previously  <cit> . the nscc inhibitor gd3+ reduced the smd by 60% . together, our results indicate that the smd in canine mesenteric vein depends on activation of membrane ion channels .

insp <dig> receptors are not required for the efs-elicited slow depolarization
to determine whether efs-induced smd is mediated by insp <dig> receptors, veins were incubated with 2apb , a selective inhibitor of insp <dig> receptors and hence of gpcr-plc-insp3-mediated ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum. surprisingly, smd to  <dig>  hz efs remained unaffected by 2apb . to test the possibility that the lack of effect of 2apb was due to poor membrane permeability, we carried out mechanical experiments with mesenteric veins, incubated with 2apb  prior to incubation with increasing concentrations of the α1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine . 2apb produced a significant rightward shift of the concentration-response curve of methoxamine  and a decrease of the ec <dig> from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm . these results suggest that activation of insp <dig> receptors may be unnecessary for the smd. this possibility was also confirmed by the inability of another inhibitor of insp <dig> receptors, xestospongin c , to reduce the efs-evoked smd . therefore, the efs-mediated smd may not require release of ca2+ from insp <dig> receptor-operated stores.

pi3k blockers reduce the efs-elicited slow depolarization
to test whether pi3ks are involved in the efs-induced smd, we incubated tissue strips with the pi3k inhibitors wortmannin  and ly- <dig> . both inhibitors significantly reduced the smd elicited by  <dig>  hz efs from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv in controls to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv, respectively , indicating that activation of pi3ks is required for the efs-induced activation of ion channels and smd. incubation of veins with exogenous ne  induced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv smd, which was reduced to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv  in the presence of wortmannin , suggesting that both efs and exogenous ne-induced smd are mediated by pi3k.

exogenous ne and clonidine activate pi3ks
to determine whether ne directly activates pi3ks, we measured phosphorylation of akt in control vein segments and in tissues incubated with exogenous ne . incubation with ne increased phosphorylation of akt about 2-fold the basal . when smooth muscle strips were preincubated with wortmannin  or ly- <dig> , ne failed to increase phosphorylation of akt. these results indicate that ne-elicited phosphorylation of akt in mesenteric vein requires activation of pi3ks.

as shown in fig.  <dig> and fig  <dig>  incubation of veins with yohimbine significantly reduced both the ne-induced and clonidine-induced contractions as well as the smd elicited by efs. these observations raise the possibility that the efs and exogenous ne-induced activation of pi3ks may be mediated by α2-adrenoceptors. to test this possibility, we assayed phosphorylation of akt  in tissues incubated with clonidine  in the absence or presence of yohimbine . clonidine alone increased phosphorylation of akt to  <dig> -fold the basal phosphorylation and this increase was abolished by inhibition of α2-adrenoceptors with yohimbine and by inhibition of pi3ks with ly- <dig>  these data indicate that α2-adrenoceptors are coupled to pi3ks and their downstream target akt.

previous experiments have shown that pi3kγ mediates signaling downstream of gpcrs  <cit> . to test whether ne activates pi3kγ, we incubated mesenteric vein with exogenous ne, then immunoprecipitated pi3kγ and used the immunoprecipitated kinase to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol  in vitro. as shown in fig. 7b, stimulation with ne increased the amount of pi3p , suggesting that ne activated pi3kγ. ne-mediated phosphorylation of pi was reversed in strips preincubated with ly- <dig>  indicating that it was a pi3k-dependent event. to test whether α2-adrenoceptors are linked to activation of pi3kγ, we analyzed the activation of pi3kγ in veins incubated with clonidine  in the absence or presence of yohimbine . as shown in fig. 7d, clonidine activated pi3kγ to  <dig> -fold the basal, while yohimbine eliminated this activation. thus, the activation of pi3ks, and more specifically pi3kγ, by exogenous ne and clonidine suggests that α2-adrenoceptors are coupled to pi3kγ via activation of g-proteins.

stimulation of atypical pkc contributes to the efs-elicited smd
pi3kγ may be linked to membrane ion channels  via isozymes of the multifunctional pkc family. to test this possibility, we incubated mesenteric veins with the broad-spectrum pkc blocker chelerythrine . although chelerythrine reduced the response to  <dig>  hz efs from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv, the residual smd remained unchanged in veins, incubated simultaneously with ly- <dig> and chelerythrine prior to efs . these results not only implicate the existence of a pkc-dependent component in the efs-induced smd , but also suggest that pi3kγ and pkc may signal to ion channels in a linear fashion. to narrow down the pkcs that function downstream of pi3kγ, we used calphostin c, an inhibitor of classical and novel pkcs  <cit> . one-hour incubation of mesenteric veins with calphostin c  failed to inhibit efs-stimulated smd . however, calphostin c significantly reduced the contractile responses to pma , which is mediated by classical and novel pkcs . together, these results suggest that activation of atypical, rather than classical or novel pkc isozymes is involved in the smd.

exogenous ne and clonidine activate pkcζ
since exogenous ne and clonidine activated pi3kγ, we tested whether these agents also activate pkcζ, a specific substrate of pi3kγ  <cit> . vein segments incubated with ne  and clonidine  caused activation of for a synthetic pkcζ peptide substrate in vitro to  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold the basal kinase activity of non-stimulated controls . the ne-induced activation of pkcζ was significantly reduced in tissues incubated with the pi3k inhibitor ly- <dig>  and was eliminated by a specific myristoylated peptide inhibitor of pkcζ  in vitro . similarly, the clonidine-induced activation of pkcζ was eliminated in tissues preincubated with yohimbine and ly- <dig> . these results indicate that stimulation of canine mesenteric veins with ne and clonidine is associated with activation of pi3ks and a subsequent activation of pkcζ.

ion channel blockers and pi3k blockers do not inhibit release of ne
reduction of the smd could be the result of suppressed ne release from sympathetic nerve terminals in veins, incubated with protein kinase and ion channel blockers. to test this possibility, we assayed the efs-evoked release of ne in superfusates collected during efs in control veins and in tissues preincubated with each of the aforementioned blockers. the average efs -evoked overflow of ne in tissue controls  was  <dig> ±  <dig> fmol/mg . in preincubated tissues, the overflow of ne changed to   <dig> ±  <dig> in the presence of nfa ,  <dig> ±  <dig> by nppb ,  <dig> ±  <dig> by dids ,  <dig> ±  <dig> by wortmannin , and  <dig> ±  <dig> by ly- <dig> . therefore, none of these agents reduced the efs-evoked overflow of ne, indicating that their effects on the efs-induced smd are not due to inhibited ne release but to activation of postjunctional  mechanisms.

discussion
the ne-induced membrane depolarization is an essential requirement for opening vocc, ca2+ entry and smooth muscle contraction, and hence it represents an important mechanism of autonomic neurovascular control. previous studies  <cit>  as well as the present work indicate that α2-adrenoceptors are involved in the smd and the vasoconstriction of mesenteric vein. however, the downstream mechanisms that couple α2-adronoceptors to smd remain undefined. for example, ne-induced activation of clcca plays a key role in the associated vasoconstriction and presumed membrane depolarization in various vascular networks  <cit> , but nscc may also participate in the ne-induced vasoconstriction  <cit> . in the present study, we have expanded upon these previous works by directly measuring membrane potential in response to efs of intact canine isolated mesenteric veins. we found that the smd in response to efs is frequency-dependent, and is sensitive to the fast na+ channel blocker ttx, to the inhibitor of neuronal n-type ca2+ channels ω-conotoxin gvia  <cit> , and to the selective antagonist of α2-adrenoceptors yohimbine. consistent with previous works, therefore, our results indicate that efs gives rise to a smd, which is mediated by smooth muscle α2-adrenoceptors and hence is primarily mediated by ne, released upon action potential. furthermore, the smd of the vascular smooth muscle cell membrane appears to be mediated by channels sensitive to nfa, nppb, and dids. although these inhibitors target transporters with presumed high preference for cl-  <cit> , they may also affect other ion channels, such as the inhibition of nscc by dids  <cit> . because incubation of mesenteric veins with the nscc blocker gd3+ partially reduced the efs-evoked smd, our results suggest that activation of nscc may indeed contribute to the efs-elicited smd in this blood vessel. none of the channel blockers reduced the release of ne thus demonstrating that the decrease of smd is mediated by postjunctional smooth muscle mechanisms. the efs-induced smd remained unaffected by the insp <dig> receptor inhibitors 2apb and xestospongin c, ruling out a substantial role of insp <dig> receptor-mediated ca2+ release in this response. therefore, smooth muscle cell chloride channels and/or ncss appear to be the primary activities that mediate the smd in the canine mesenteric vein.

furthermore, we identified a novel signal transduction mechanism governing the slow membrane depolarization, which involves enzymes of the pkc family. first, we used two pkc inhibitors with distinct pkc isozymes selectivity. chelerythrine, for example, acts on the conserved catalytic domain of pkc as a competitive inhibitor with respect to the phosphate acceptor and a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to atp  <cit> . therefore, chelerythrine can inhibit pkcs of all classes and effects mediated by them, including the slow depolarization in mesenteric veins. in contrast, calphostin c interacts with the regulatory domain of pkc by competing for the binding site of diacylglycerol and phorbol esters, but not ca2+ and phospholipids. thus, calphostin c is more specific inhibitor for classical and novel, and less specific for atypical pkc  <cit> . in the present study, chelerythrine reduced, while calphostin c had no effect on the smd. the lack of effect of calphostin c indicates that the efs-induced membrane depolarization is most likely mediated by atypical pkc. we provided experimental support of this possibility by showing a distinct activation of the atypical pkcζ in mesenteric veins incubated with exogenous ne and clonidine. although further studies are needed to identify the precise pkc isoform contributing to the α2-adrenoceptor mediated smd, the present study clearly suggests a pkc isozyme-specific regulation of the efs-  induced slow membrane depolarization in canine mesenteric vein.

the observation that atypical pkcs are involved in the smc allowed us to speculate about the identity of some specific signaling molecules that function upstream of pkcζ, and could mediate the smd as well. pi3ks, and particularly pi3kγ, was an obvious candidate for several reasons. firstly, pi3kγ is essential for activation of various ion transporters including l-type ca2+ channels  <cit>  and metabotropic nonselective cation channels  <cit> . secondly, pi3kγ activates the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase  <dig> , and although the latter can modulate classical  and novel  pkc isoform, activation of atypical  pkcs, and particularly pkcζ, is a highly specific event downstream of pi3kγ-pdk <dig>  <cit> . we experimentally supported the hypothesized role of pi3ks by showing that the pi3k inhibitors wortmannin and ly- <dig> prevent the ne and clonidine-dependent activation of pkcζ and the smd. these data are consistent with a role of pi3k in the regulation of voltage-independent cl- channels, as well. pi3kγ in particular is activated by gβγ dimers, which are released upon dissociation of gαβγ complexes following activation of gpcrs  <cit> . our experimental data demonstrate activation of pi3kγ in veins incubated with the g-protein coupled α2-adrenoceptor agonists ne and clonidine. furthermore, since the ne and clonidine-mediated activation of pi3kγ, pkcζ and of the smd was prevented by yohimbine, our results demonstrate that activation of α2-adrenoceptors is required for activation of pi3kγ and pkcζ, and possibly for activation of membrane cl- and/or ncss channels and smd in canine mesenteric vein. while the molecular identity of the membrane ion channels involved in these effects is presently elusive, our electrophysiological and biochemical data provide support to the possibility that activation of α2-adrenoceptors, pi3k and atypical pkc  is essential for the regulation of the autonomic nervous system and vascular smooth muscle tone.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we provide functional and biochemical evidence that ne, released from postganglionic nerve terminals, activates postjunctional α2-adrenoceptors, pi3ks and atypical pkcs in canine isolated mesenteric vein. our results further suggest that specific isoforms of the pi3k and pkc families, i.e. pi3kγ and pkcζ respectively, may participate in the signal transduction pathway that couples α2-adrenoceptors to membrane ion channels. this signal transduction pathway mediates slow membrane depolarization and vasoconstriction of canine mesenteric vein.
