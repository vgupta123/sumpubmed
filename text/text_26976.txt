BACKGROUND
pancreatic beta and alpha cells are clustered together in pancreatic islets to ensure tight coordination of the secretion of insulin and glucagon, whose opposing actions on hepatic glucose metabolism are essential for glucose homeostasis. yet, despite the functional juxtaposition of insulin and glucagon, pancreatic beta and alpha cells derive from a common progenitor population that during embryonic development is first uniquely defined by the expression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor neurogenin  <dig>   <cit> . under the influence of lineage-specific sets of transcription factors, neurog3+ early endocrine progenitors undergo stepwise differentiation along parallel lineages to develop into mature alpha and beta cells . it follows that upon completion of their differentiation and maturation, alpha and beta cells, by virtue of the secretion of their signature hormones glucagon and insulin, have adapted to functionally opposing roles in glucose metabolism. insulin acts on most peripheral tissues to facilitate the clearance of glucose from the general circulation by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis and promoting hepatic glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipocytes  <cit> . furthermore, insulin conveys important metabolic feedback to hypothalamic feeding centers regarding the energy state of the body  <cit> . in contrast, the hepatic actions of glucagon, which include the stimulation of glycogenolysis, provide an essential counter-regulatory mechanism to ensure stable glycemic control  <cit> . the serious consequences of the absolute insulin deficiency that occur secondary to autoimmune attack of the beta cells in type  <dig> diabetes as well as the relative insulin deficiency characteristic of type  <dig> diabetes illustrate the critical importance of insulin. however, the view that hyperglucagonaemia contributes significantly to the progression of both major forms of diabetes has gained acceptance  <cit> . it follows that a comprehensive understanding of both the alpha and the beta cell and how they regulate glucose homeostasis through the coordination of their activity quite possibly will hold the key to therapeutic interventions aimed at curbing the current diabetes epidemic.

the intimate clustering of beta and alpha cells in pancreatic islets subserves the tight coordination of the secretion of insulin and glucagon, but has long complicated the process of obtaining highly pure populations of alpha and beta cells from isolated islets. to overcome this challenge, we have developed a reporter strain that fluorescently marks all beta cells by the nuclear expression of mcherry under control of the mouse insulin  <dig>  promoter and crossed it to a gfp reporter line that labels alpha cells. bitransgenic offspring of a cross between both lines then enabled the collection of purified populations of alpha and beta cells from the same islets. these tools enabled the first transcriptome-wide comparison of murine alpha and beta cells by rna-seq, which revealed over  <dig> genes that are differentially expressed  <  <dig> %) between both populations, with insulin the second-most significantly enriched in the beta cell fraction. next generation sequencing combines the tremendous benefits in sensitivity and dynamic range of techniques traditionally used to assess expression of targeted sets of genes, such as quantitative pcr, with the scale of microarray and the distinct benefit that no a priori sequence information is required, which enables novel transcript discovery. we take advantage of our data to conduct the first transcriptome-wide assessment of the similarities and differences that exist between rodent and human beta cells. these data provide an unprecedented global view of the core beta cell transcriptome that is conserved across species, while simultaneously highlighting marked differences in the expression of receptors and associated long non-coding rnas  between beta cells of both species. an unbiased and comprehensive comparison between mouse and human beta cells is an invaluable resource that can facilitate the translation of preclinical findings in rodent models towards therapeutic strategies aimed at alleviating or curing diabetes.

RESULTS
generation and validation of mins1-h2b-mcherry and s100b-egfp reporter lines
while available beta cell reporter lines such as the mip-gfp and mip-rfp lines  <cit> , facilitate the purification of pure populations of beta cells, reporter expression in these lines is mosaic, which leaves as much as half or more of all beta cells not marked  <cit> . to obtain a beta cell reporter line that faithfully and selectively labels all beta cells, we generated a transgenic reporter line by cloning an open reading frame encoding a fusion protein between human histone-2b  and monomeric cherry  downstream of a  <dig>  kb mouse insulin  <dig> promoter  . the resulting mins1-h2b-mcherry transgenic reporter mice demonstrate nuclear mcherry expression in all beta cells  and are healthy, viable and normoglycemic with no sign of glucose intolerance . to co-label alpha cells, we capitalized on the serendipitous discovery that enhanced green fluorescent protein  expression in the s100b-egfp transgenic reporter line  <cit>  labels alpha cells within the islet . as there is no detectable expression of endogenous s100b transcript in purified s100b + alpha cells, the expression of egfp in alpha cells is an artifactual, but useful trait that enables the purification of alpha cells by facs.figure  <dig>

whole transcriptome analysis of highly enriched mouse beta and alpha cells
islets isolated from two replicate groups of bitransgenic offspring of a cross between the mins1-h2b-mcherry and s100b-egfp reporter lines  enable the simultaneous purification of alpha and beta cells by facs . we detected not a single read in our egfp + alpha cell fractions that maps to mcherry, and only three reads that map to egfp in our mcherry + beta cell fractions, underscoring the quality of our facs purification strategy . furthermore, while the expression of the endogenous ins <dig> gene measures in at an average rpkm   <cit>  value of approximately  <dig>  , the use of the 10 kb mouse ins <dig> promoter to drive h2b-mcherry transcription in the beta cells results in mcherry rpkm values of only slightly over  <dig>  this relatively low mrna expression despite the use of one of the strongest promoters in the beta cell context partially explains the relatively dim mcherry signal in the nuclei of beta cells and may have fortuitously contributed to the fact that our mins1-h2b-mcherry beta cell reporter mice are healthy and do not display or develop any beta cell defects that would precipitate diabetes .figure  <dig>

a comprehensive comparison of the transcriptomes of alpha and beta cells revealed  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed between beta and alpha cells. a total of  <dig> genes were significantly  enriched in beta cells. the insulin  <dig>  and ins <dig> genes are the second- and third most significantly enriched genes in beta cells compared to alpha cells, after the beta cell-specific transcription factor mafa , which serves as a potent confirmation of the high purity of the beta cell population obtained by the use of our mins1-h2b-mcherry reporter mouse. other genes that were highly significantly enriched in mouse beta cells are genes encoding the prolactin receptor  and the peptide hormone urocortin <dig>  . conversely,  <dig> genes were significantly  enriched in the alpha cell fraction, including the mouse alpha cell-specific transcription factors arx, irx <dig>  mafb, as well as glucagon  . it is no surprise that ins <dig> and ins <dig> are the most abundantly detected transcripts in beta cells, comprising on average  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, of all mapped reads in the beta cell libraries . in the alpha cell-enriched libraries, gcg is responsible for on average  <dig> % of all mapped reads. expression of other islet hormones, including pancreatic polypeptide , somatostatin , peptide yy  and islet amyloid polypeptide , is between  <dig>  and 33-fold lower than the expression of gcg, which confirms the successful enrichment of alpha cells . while the abundance of ins2/ins <dig> and gcg transcripts is expected in beta- and alpha cell-enriched libraries, respectively, the fraction of reads that maps to insulin is lower than for human beta cells, where upwards of 38% of all mapped reads in facs-purified beta cells were assigned to ins  <cit> . as a further validation of our facs purification strategy, expression of known mouse beta cell-specific genes in the alpha cell fraction, including ins <dig>  ins <dig>  ucn <dig>  <cit>  and mafa  <cit> , was on average less than  <dig> % of the expression detected in beta cells . conversely, transcripts encoding the alpha cell-transcription factors arx <dig>  irx <dig> and mafb and gcg, which are all highly significantly enriched in alpha cells , are detectable in the beta cell fraction at on average less than  <dig> % of their expression in alpha cells . we compared our alpha and beta cell transcriptomes to a previous study that contrasted facs-purified mip-gpf + beta cells to transcriptomes of intact islets  <cit> . their effort was somewhat limited by the aforementioned mosaicism of the mip-gfp reporter line  <cit> , which reduced the contrast between the transcriptomes of mip-gfp + beta cells and total islets  <cit> . this manifested as the unremarkable enrichment of key beta cell markers including ins <dig>  ins <dig>  mafa and others in this study compared to our work .

functional validation of alpha and beta cell transcriptomes
while global pathway analysis of beta cell-enriched genes by david  <cit>  reveals significant association with keywords linked to aspects of beta cell function and disease , generic functional categories can lack the resolution to discriminate between relatively similar cell types such as alpha and beta cells. we therefore assessed the expression of the transcription factors that determine alpha and beta cell identity, often in a mutually repressive fashion   <cit> . the abundant expression of the transcription factors pdx <dig>  nkx <dig> , mafa and mnx <dig> in mature beta cells  is in close agreement with several reports that demonstrate their expression to be necessary for mature beta cell identity and function . mafb, arx, irx <dig> and irx <dig> are significantly enriched in mouse alpha cells. interestingly, many transcription factors that are required for proper islet development and function, such as pax <dig>  neurod <dig>  isl <dig>  rfx <dig>  nkx <dig>  , myt <dig>  foxo <dig>  and foxa <dig> are robustly expressed in both alpha and beta cell fractions and are not significantly, or only modestly enriched in either population. neurog <dig> is required for the formation of the endocrine pancreas  <cit>  and remains detectable at relatively low levels , but is depleted from beta cells  in contrast to reports that attribute neurog <dig> expression in adult islets to mature beta cells . pax <dig> is important to repress the alpha cell-determining transcription factor arx and facilitate differentiation along the beta and delta lineage  <cit> , but is undetectable in mature mouse beta cells   <cit> . we similarly compared the relative enrichment of key genes involved in glucose sensing, stimulus secretion coupling and insulin exocytosis between alpha and beta cells and found that the facilitated glucose transporter slc2a <dig> , glucose-6-phosphate convertase  <dig> , proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type  <dig> , ero 1-like beta , and synaptotagmin-like  <dig>  were highly significantly enriched in beta cells, while genes encoding the atp-sensitive potassium channel and voltage-gated calcium channels were equally abundantly expressed in alpha and beta cells .figure  <dig> 
comparison of mouse beta and alpha cell transcriptomes based on functional annotation. establishment and maintenance of alpha and beta cell identity is regulated by a complex interplay of transcription factors , whose expression pattern is accurately reflected by our mouse alpha and beta cell transcriptomes. actual transcription factor expression in beta and alpha cells is represented by a dot plot where each dot represents an individual gene . genes that are significantly enriched  in beta or alpha cells are highlighted in red and green, respectively, with genes enriched with p < 1 × 10- <dig> displayed in bold for emphasis. ins <dig>  ins <dig>  and gcg are marked for reference. see also additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 



differences between mouse and human islet cells
mice are widely used as models for islet disease, despite marked differences between rodent and primate islet architecture and innervation . the full transcriptomes of mouse beta and alpha cells enable a comprehensive comparison of both the similarities and differences in gene expression between mouse and human alpha and beta cells. to validate the approach, we compared the expression of genes with known species differences between mouse and human alpha and beta cells. mafa and mafb are selectively expressed in adult mouse alpha and beta cells, respectively   <cit> . in contrast, while mafa expression is similarly restricted to human beta cells, mafb expression is retained in human beta cells and therefore not enriched in either human islet population   <cit> . as a second example of species differences between mouse and human islets, ucn <dig> is highly selectively expressed in mouse beta cells  <cit>   but is a common feature of human alpha and beta cells  <cit> . this is reflected by robust expression of human ucn <dig> but lack of enrichment in either human islet cell type . the gene encoding the related peptide hormone corticotropin-releasing hormone , best known as the principal hypothalamic initiator of the stress response, is not detectable in mouse islets  but is highly enriched in human alpha cells , likely explaining the endogenous insulinotropic activity in human islets that is blocked by the selective crh <dig> receptor blocker antalarmin  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
validation of known differences in gene expression between mouse and human alpha and beta cells. we assessed the expression of two sets of genes, mafa/mafb and ucn3/crh, that markedly differ in distribution between alpha and beta cells in mouse  and human  islets. mafa is restricted to beta cells of both species, while mafb is selectively expressed in mouse alpha cells , but expressed in human beta cells as well . ucn <dig> is highly selective for mouse beta cells while crh is detected in neither mouse islet population . by contrast, ucn <dig> expression is a common feature of human alpha and beta cells, while crh is enriched in human alpha cells . human rna-seq data are from  <cit> . see also additional file  <dig> for single channel images.



comprehensive comparison of mouse and human beta cell transcriptomes
having thus validated our approach, we proceeded with a global comparison of the genes enriched in mouse and human beta cells using a comparable set of transcriptomes for human facs-purified beta cells  <cit> . one has to be very careful when conducting cross-species comparisons of next-generation sequencing libraries that are generated by different investigators using different protocols. to minimize the potential caveats associated with such a comparison, we built in several safeguards in our analysis pipeline. we reanalyzed the raw human sequence files in the same manner as our mouse data and used transcriptome data from beta cells of both species expressed as rpkm to allow direct, unbiased comparison. this yielded a total of  <dig> genes that demonstrated rpkm expression values >  <dig> in both mouse and human beta cells and thus constitute the common beta cell transcriptome . this extensive list includes many of the key genes that define beta cell identity such as ins2/ins, ucn <dig>  mafa, nkx <dig> , pdx <dig>  ero1lb, glp1r, g6pc <dig>  and the atp-sensitive potasssium channel subunits abcc <dig> and kcnj <dig> . to identify the most striking species differences between mouse and human beta cells, we focused only on the genes that demonstrated both significant enrichment  and over 10-fold difference in beta cells of one species over the other. this approach identified  <dig> genes that were either uniquely expressed  or significantly enriched  in mouse beta cells . conversely, we identified  <dig> genes as either uniquely expressed  or significantly enriched  in human beta cells . significant enrichment in gene expression in one species correlated with the presence of pdx <dig> chip-seq peaks specific to that species   <cit> , which in turn correlated strongly with the presence of species-specific pdx <dig> binding motifs . this suggests that differences in the mouse and human pdx <dig> cistrome contribute to the differential expression of genes between mouse and human beta cells, as is illustrated by the sytl <dig> gene, which is uniquely expressed in mouse beta cells and is associated with a strong mouse-specific pdx <dig> chip-seq peak that overlies a consensus pdx <dig> binding motif in the mouse that is absent from human .figure  <dig> 
comparison of the mouse and human beta cell transcriptomes. the unbiased comparison of mouse and human transcriptomes reveals a common core of over  <dig> genes that are expressed at an rpkm value >  <dig> in beta cells of both species . a total of  <dig> genes  was robustly  and significantly  higher expressed in mouse beta cells  while  <dig> genes  were by the same criteria significantly higher expressed in human beta cells . genes enriched in mouse beta cells were co-enriched for mouse-specific pdx <dig> binding and vice versa
. moreover, enrichment of pdx <dig> chip-seq peaks in either species is associated with species-specific pdx <dig> binding motifs , as illustrated for sytl4
. iapp transcript levels in purified beta cells  and islet iapp peptide content  are markedly reduced in human compared to mouse. additional browser plots demonstrate notable examples of significantly enriched or selectively expressed genes in either species including gad2
, prlr
, ghr
 and cntfr
. human rna-seq data are from  <cit> , chip-seq data are from  <cit> . see also additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 



the small subset of  <dig> genes that is significantly  and robustly  enriched in mouse beta cells, but still detectable in human beta cells, constitutes less than  <dig> % of the common beta cell transcriptome . this cluster includes iapp, which is more than 30-fold reduced in mouse over human beta cells , perhaps in adaptation to the amyloid properties of human but not mouse iapp that contribute to the onset and progression of type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . the strongly disparate relative expression of the gene encoding iapp in mouse and human islets is in contrast to other hormones such as ins/ins <dig> and ucn <dig>  which are expressed at similar levels between mouse and human beta cells . we further validated the relatively low expression of iapp message by demonstrating that iapp peptide content is reduced almost 28-fold in human islets compared to mouse, while ins and gcg content is similar in islets from both species . a similarly small set of  <dig> genes that is detectably expressed in beta cells of both species, but robustly and significantly enriched in human beta cells includes gad <dig> , which is a major auto-antigen in human type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> .

notable differences in cell surface receptors between human and mouse beta cells
several of the most notable gene expression differences between mouse and human beta cells concern cell surface receptors of the class i helical cytokine receptor family  <cit> . prlr has long been implicated in beta cell mass expansion in adaptation to the increased metabolic demand of pregnancy in rodents in response to prl or placental lactogens  <cit> . indeed, prlr is abundantly and selectively expressed in mouse beta cells . in contrast, while prlr is detectable in facs-purified human beta cells and is associated with a human pdx <dig> chip-seq signature , it is expressed at approximately 15-fold lower rpkm values than mouse beta cells  and is significantly depleted compared to co-purified human non-beta cells . similarly, related receptor genes for growth hormone   and ciliary neurotrophic factor   are robustly expressed by mouse beta cells, but are virtually undetectable in human beta cells.

novel transcript discovery
we leveraged our combined alpha and beta rna-seq expression data for novel islet transcript discovery in the mouse islet. our initial list of novel transcripts included 73% of the lncrnas identified in purified mouse beta cells  <cit>  and 54% of the lncrnas identified from total mouse islets  <cit> . we formulated a stringent set of criteria  to generate a set of  <dig> novel lncrna transcripts. of these,  <dig> are positioned within the introns of known protein-coding genes, while the remaining  <dig> are situated in intergenic regions, the majority of which were not identified in previous studies of mouse islet lncrnas  <cit>  . the transcript ends for these novel islet transcripts were significantly enriched for transcription factor binding by pdx <dig> , nkx <dig>  , mafa and neurod <dig>  compared to random positions. they also were enriched for histone h <dig> lysine  <dig>  mono-methyl and tri-methyl signatures that mark transcriptionally active loci   <cit> . these observations underscore that these novel lncrnas are transcriptionally active and suggest transcriptional regulation by beta cell specific transcription factors. as lncrnas are emerging as an additional layer in the regulation of gene expression of neighboring protein-coding genes, we compared the relative enrichment of lncrnas in beta cells with the enrichment of their nearest protein-coding gene. this revealed that the ratio of expression in mouse beta and alpha cells is correlated between these novel transcripts and their nearest protein-coding gene . this general phenomenon has also been noted for human islet-specific lncrnas  <cit>  and is illustrated by novel lncrnas associated with il1r <dig> , nkx <dig>   and pparg , which are all co-enriched in mouse beta over alpha cells in concert with their closest protein-coding gene. to test whether these novel beta cell lncrnas are subject to transcriptional regulation, we stimulated primary mouse islets overnight with  <dig>  mm glucose and compared their expression to non-stimulated control islets from the same pool. several of our set of  <dig> lncrnas were among the most significantly up regulated  or down regulated  by glucose of all coding and non-coding transcripts.figure  <dig> 
the mouse alpha and beta cell transcriptomes reveal unique beta cell-specific lncrnas. mouse islet lncrnas demonstrate significant enrichment for binding by the beta cell-specific transcription factors pdx <dig>  and nkx <dig>  , are enriched for h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> markers of transcriptionally active loci  and are co-regulated with their nearest protein-coding neighbor . this is illustrated by lncrnas adjacent to nkx <dig> 
 and pparg
, which are co-enriched in mouse beta cells with these protein-coding genes and strongly associate with binding of beta cell-specific transcription factors. overnight stimulation of mouse islets with  <dig>  mm glucose strongly regulates a subset of lncrnas in comparison to protein-coding transcripts  as illustrated by lncrnas that are significantly up regulated by glucose at chromosome x ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  or down regulated by glucose at chromosome  <dig> . chip-seq and h3k <dig> data are from  <cit> . numbers inside the grey boxes refer to lncrna coordinates and correspond to additional file  <dig> 
the
il1r1
locus is uniquely regulated in mouse beta cells.
il1r <dig> is highly enriched in mouse beta cells when compared to both mouse alpha cells  and human beta cells . this expression pattern is mimicked by a beta cell-specific lncrna upstream of the il1r <dig> transcription start in the mouse but not human locus. both the il1r <dig> transcription start site and the upstream lncrna in mouse are associated with strong transcription factor binding for pdx <dig>  nkx <dig> , mafa and neurod <dig>  while there is only limited nkx <dig>  binding at the human locus . cell surface expression of il1r1/cd121a on mins1-h2b-mcherry + beta cells is confirmed by facs  and immunofluorescence . both il1r <dig> and its associated lncrna are significantly up regulated by overnight stimulation of mouse islets with  <dig>  mm glucose . the il1r <dig> lncrna features  <dig> repeats of the ets <dig> consensus binding site within a 300 bp stretch of dna , which may offer an explanation for the strong glucose regulation of il1r <dig> and its associated lncrna, as ets <dig> expression is significantly increased by elevated glucose . human rna-seq data are from  <cit> , chip-seq data are from  <cit> . numbers inside the grey box refer to lncrna coordinates and correspond to additional file  <dig> 



the interleukin- <dig> receptor locus in beta cells
the interleukin- <dig> receptor type  <dig>  locus aptly recapitulates all aspects of our study. il1r <dig> is the most abundantly expressed cell surface receptor on mouse beta cells by a considerable margin with an rpkm value >  <dig>  expression of il1r <dig> is significantly enriched in mouse beta over alpha cells  and the mouse il1r <dig> promoter is associated with strong transcription factor binding by the beta cell transcription factors pdx <dig>  nkx <dig>  and neurod <dig> , validating the beta cell as the source of il1r <dig> expression. in sharp contrast, il1r <dig> expression in human islet populations, while detectable, is significantly lower in human beta cells in comparison to both mouse beta cells  and human alpha cells . the high levels of il1r <dig> message in mouse beta cells translate into abundant cell surface expression of il1r1/cd121a on mcherry + beta cells as measured by facs  and confocal microscopy . an additional notable feature unique to the mouse il1r <dig> locus is a lncrna positioned about 30 kb upstream of the il1r <dig> transcription start site. this lncrna demonstrates strong beta cell enrichment similar to the adjacent il1r <dig> transcript and is associated with significant transcription factor binding by pdx <dig>  nkx <dig> , mafa and neurod <dig> . the corresponding region of the human il1r <dig> locus shows no human pdx <dig> binding or evidence for the expression of a similar lncrna in islet cells . moreover, expression of this mouse-specific lncrna upstream of il1r <dig> is the most significantly up regulated of all transcripts, coding and non-coding, following overnight stimulation of mouse islets with glucose . a repeat of  <dig> consensus binding sites for the transcription factor v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus e <dig> oncogene homolog  <dig>   that is absent from the human il1r <dig> locus may contribute to both the expression of this lncrna by mouse but not human beta cells and the robust glucose-induced up regulation of its expression, as ets <dig> expression is significantly up regulated by glucose .

discussion
to ensure tight coordination of the secretion of insulin and glucagon, pancreatic beta and alpha cells are intimately colocalized in the pancreas, which has long complicated the process of obtaining highly pure populations of alpha and beta cells from isolated islets. we successfully overcame this problem by generating a mins1-h2b-mcherry beta cell reporter line that enabled us to achieve over 98% beta cell purity, which is markedly higher than previous studies that used antibody-based strategies to purify beta cells from dissociated human islet suspensions  <cit> . the fact that both mouse insulin genes rank as the second and third most significantly enriched genes in mouse beta over alpha cells - trailing only the key beta cell-specific transcription factor mafa - underscores our high quality of beta cell enrichment. further confirmation that our transcriptomes faithfully recapitulate known expression patterns in alpha and beta cells follows from the fact that expression of key alpha and beta cell transcription factors as well key genes involved in glucose sensing, stimulus secretion coupling and insulin exocytosis generally adheres closely to the literature . it is noteworthy that many additional genes involved in glycolysis, membrane depolarization, calcium entry and insulin exocytosis are not, or only modestly enriched in mouse beta over alpha cells, suggestive of similarities in the triggering of hormone release by either cell type as was recently reported  <cit> .

importantly, our transcriptome data now offer the opportunity for the systematic comparison of gene expression by mouse and human beta cells. we identified a core set of  <dig> genes that are shared between mouse and human beta cells. it is no surprise that this set contains many of the key genes required for the stimulus-appropriate release of insulin such as g6pc <dig>  ero1lb, pcsk <dig> and glp1r. we also uncovered significant transcriptome differences between mouse and human beta cells that are accompanied with species-specific enrichment of beta cell-specific transcription factors, and sometimes associated with species-specific lncrnas. we minimized the potential caveats that can stem from differences in islet isolation, dissociation, facs sorting and library preparation between laboratories by focusing only on robustly  and significantly differentially expressed  genes. further validation of transcriptome differences between mouse and human beta cell transcriptomes was obtained by demonstrating that species-specific enrichment of gene expression correlates well with species-specific enrichment of chip signatures for the beta cell specific transcription factors pdx <dig>  <cit>  and nkx <dig>   <cit> . among the more striking examples are prlr, ghr and cntfr, three related receptors that respond to structurally similar ligands  <cit> , that are abundantly and selectively expressed by mouse beta cells, with only nominal expression in human islets. co-stimulation of cntf and egf promotes acinar to beta cell transdifferentiation in diabetic mice  <cit>  and gh and prl are potent inducers of mouse beta cell proliferation  <cit>  and implicated in the expansion of maternal beta cell mass during pregnancy in mice  <cit> . however, efforts to use prl or gh to induce human beta cell proliferation in vitro have been largely unsuccessful  <cit>  and expansion of human beta cell mass during pregnancy is modest compared to mouse and driven by neogenesis instead of beta cell proliferation  <cit> . while there are clearly differences between mouse and human beta cells that prevent the latter from entering the cell cycle  <cit> , the lack of ghr and relative absence of prlr are not conducive to robust responses to their potential mitogenic ligands.

the most abundantly expressed cell surface receptor in mouse beta cells, measured by gene expression, is il1r <dig>  which responds to the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1α and il-1β. importantly, the human islet is not devoid of il1r <dig> transcript, in line with a body of literature that established that mouse and human beta cells respond to sustained il-1β stimulation with a reduction in function and an increase in apoptosis . the robustly elevated il1r <dig> expression in mouse islets could betray a more prominent role for locally produced il-1β in beta cell glucotoxicity in mouse islets and potentially render mouse beta cells more sensitive to il-1β-mediated pro-inflammatory insults. this observation is important, as local inflammation in the islet precipitated by obese conditions is thought to contribute to beta cell failure and exacerbate diabetes  <cit> .

several of the genes that displayed markedly higher expression in mouse over human beta cells, such as il1r <dig> and pparg, were flanked by mouse-specific novel lncrnas. we therefore leveraged our transcriptome data to identify  <dig> novel lncrnas that are enriched for significant transcription factor binding of key beta cell transcription factors and are co-regulated with the nearest protein-coding gene in line with previous observations  <cit> . as lncrnas are not bound by the constraints of protein-coding genes, they tend to display less sequence conservation and stability over longer phylogenetic distances  <cit> . indeed, comparison of the set of  <dig> mouse lncrnas with human  <cit>  revealed evidence for a human orthologous lncrna for only two. it appears that the repertoire of islet lncrnas is dynamic and has changed considerably since the divergence of primates and rodents, in line with the general notion that the lncrna repertoire across vertebrates is dynamic, even between closely related species  <cit> . their generally high plasticity and poor sequence conservation notwithstanding, lncrnas are emerging as an important and novel transcriptional regulatory mechanism that is likely to significantly impact beta cell fate and function. indeed, we observed that in response to stimulation with glucose, the quintessential beta cell trigger, quite a few lncrnas were up- or down regulated by 10-fold or more. the arduous task of attributing function to the beta cell-enriched lncrnas that have emerged from ours and similar studies  <cit>  is now underway.

CONCLUSIONS
rodents are commonly used to study the islets of langerhans, with the ultimate goal of improving the outlook of diabetic patients and despite considerable differences in islet architecture and innervation between rodent and primate islets. our comprehensive beta and alpha cell transcriptomes will greatly enhance our understanding of normal islet physiology and yield significant new leads to direct the behavior of its two primary endocrine constituents. importantly, our data leveraged against recently published transcriptomes for facs-purified human islet populations will now facilitate routine cross comparison between mouse and human alpha and beta cell transcriptomes. this is an invaluable resource for all with an interest in islet physiology and disease that stands to improve the translatability of rodent studies  <cit>  by ensuring that potential therapeutic targets identified by preclinical experiments on rodents are similarly expressed by human beta cells.
