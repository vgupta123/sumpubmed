BACKGROUND
baculoviruses are large enveloped viruses with double-stranded circular dna genomes and have been used for various biotechnological applications. baculoviruses are utilized for the high level production of recombinant proteins in insect cells  <cit>  and the gene transduction to mammalian cells both in vivo and in vitro as a foreign gene delivery vectors  <cit> . moreover, budded baculoviruses are applied for displaying the recombinant proteins on their surface for antibody production, functional analysis of receptors and vaccine production  <cit> . more recently, an increasing number of investigators have challenged the use of baculovirus for gene therapy applications  <cit> . the preparation of modified baculovirus vectors which are able to direct gene expression in mammalian cells represents a safer alternative over classical mammalian viruses. in order to use baculoviruses in gene therapy, the development of efficient production process towards high-titer preparation is required, because of low baculovirus transduction efficiency in mammalian cells compared to other viral delivery system, e.g. retroviruses.

autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus  and bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus  have been used in baculovirus expression system. bmnpv especially infects silkworm larvae and has been used for large-scale production of recombinant protein economically because there is no necessity for cell cultivation  <cit> . moreover, it is very difficult to cultivate bm cells with a suspension culture and amplify bmnpv in bm <dig> cell culture. the hemolymph of baculovirus-infected silkworm larvae is used as a high titer-baculovirus solution. for medical or biological uses, baculovirus purification using cation-exchange chromatography  <cit> , size exclusion chromatography   <cit> , and ion-exchange membrane chromatography  <cit>  from insect cell culture supernatant have been reported until now. but to date, the purification of baculovirus from silkworm larval hemolymph has neither been performed nor reported.

in this study, rbmnpv-hprr, which displays a native form of human prorenin receptor  with flag peptide sequence behind its signal peptide sequence on its own surface  <cit> , was produced in silkworm larval hemolymph; purified by ultracentrifugation and two different types of sec. in addition, the rapid method of bmnpv titer measurement was established using quantitative real-time pcr . this is the first report of recombinant protein-displayed bmnpv purified from silkworm larval hemolymph by purification with the help of sec.

RESULTS
establishment of bmnpv titer measurement by q-pcr
until now, plaque assay  <cit> , end-point dilution method  <cit>  and antibody-based assay  <cit>  have been known as titer determination method for baculoviruses. the antibody-based assay allows the time reduction required for baculovirus titer, but the antibody for a baculovirus-specific protein, dna-binding protein  which is expensive is mandatory. recently, the plotting of cross points for individual baculovirus dna dilution measured by q-pcr and titer determination by end-point dilution method has a precise linear correlation with baculovirus titer  <cit> . therefore, at the first stage of experiments, it was uncertain whether q-pcr can be applied to bmnpv.

to apply the q-pcr on bmnpv titer determination,  <dig> bp dna fragment of bmnpv was amplified at the same position, as done for  <dig> bp dna fragment of acmnpv, upstream of ie- <dig> gene. these two dna fragments have approximately  <dig> % sequence identity. recombinant bmnpv-cp-/bx-ggt <dig> stock  <cit> , whose titer was determined by end-point dilution method, was diluted and its baculovirus dna was extracted from each diluted baculovirus dna solution by high pure viral nucleic acid kit . the cross point for each elute, containing baculovirus dna, was determined by q-pcr. as the number of cycle increased, the fluorescent intensity increased in all samples except for a negative control . no dna amplification was observed for negative control containing  <dig> μl of water instead of baculovirus dna. the melting curves of amplified dna fragment by q-pcr were analyzed. single peaks were observed at approximately 82°c, indicating that dna fragments were amplified specifically by forward and reverse primers without any unspecific binding . standard calibration curve of cross points vs. virus titer is shown in figure 1c. this result confirms that corresponding cross points and determined titers were correlated linearly with a correlation efficiency of  <dig> . on 2% agarose gel, dna fragment at between  <dig> and  <dig> bp markers was found without any other bands .

comparison of baculovirus production using between bm <dig> cells and silkworm larvae
for protein expression in bm <dig> cells, recombinant bmnpv was prepared by transfection of recombinant bmnpv bacmid dna into bm <dig> cells. following transfection, bmnpv is required to be amplified several times in order to obtain sufficient virus titer for protein expression. moreover, time to amplify bmnpv is required due to slow growth rate of bm cells compared to sf- <dig> cells.

transfection solution was prepared using  <dig>  μg of rbmnpv-hprr bacmid including helper plasmid. five milliliter of transfection solution was obtained from  <dig>  ×  <dig> bm <dig> cells with cultivation after  <dig> days post-transfection. hemolymph was also prepared from  <dig>  μg of rbmnpv-hprr bacmid -injected silkworm larva. approximately  <dig>  ml of hemolymph was obtained from a silkworm larva at  <dig> days p.i. of rbmnpv-hprr bacmid. baculovirus titers of transfection solution and bmnpv-infected silkworm larval hemolymph were measured by q-pcr . titers of transfection solution and hemolymph were  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml, whereas the total baculovirus numbers were  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu, respectively. the baculovirus number from hemolymph was  <dig>  ×  <dig> times higher than that obtained from transfection solution in spite of the use of the same amount of rbmnpv-hprr bacmid.

baculovirus titer in larval hemolymph from rbmnpv-hprr-infected silkworm larvae
it was previously reported that baculovirus-infected silkworm larval hemolymph was infectious to silkworm larvae  <cit> . thirty μl of rbmnpv-hprr solutions  were injected into silkworm larvae, followed by measuring the baculovirus titer after  <dig> or  <dig> days post-injection . surprisingly,  <dig> pfu/larva  was enough to infect all silkworm larvae. even the 1:105-diluted hemolymph was still found to be infectious to silkworm larvae. when  <dig> μl of  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml rbmnpv-hprr  was injected, the highest baculovirus titer  was obtained for  <dig> days breeding . the volume of hemolymph from silkworm larvae injected with  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml  at  <dig> days breeding was similar, but at  <dig> days breeding it was only one third or one quarter of hemolymph. therefore, when  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml baculovirus solution was injected, total baculovirus number in hemolymph was found to be the highest  .

purification of rbmnpv-hprr from silkworm larval hemolymph using size exclusion chromatography
hemolymph was harvested from rbmnpv-hprr containing hemolymph -injected silkworm larvae at  <dig> days p.i. and centrifuged at  <dig> × g to remove insoluble materials. the supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at  <dig> × g in 25% sucrose cushion. the pellet contained a large amount of dark-brownish materials that were hard and insoluble . this dark-brownish pellet was obviously different from translucent white baculovirus pellets. in order to remove insoluble substances, the hemolymph was centrifuged again at  <dig> × g and filtered using  <dig>  μm membrane filters. this filtrate was centrifuged at  <dig> × g in 25% sucrose cushion, but still the dark-brownish pellets were visible.

superdex  <dig> 10/ <dig> gl column was used for purification of rbmnpv-hprr from larval hemolymph. larval hemolymph was filtered with  <dig>  μm membrane filter, and  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml rbmnpv-hprr was obtained. five hundred μl of the filtrate was applied upon superdex  <dig> 10/ <dig> gl column equilibrated with pbs. elution was performed by pbs and every  <dig>  ml was collected. its chromatogram is shown in figure 3a. the first peak was eluted between  <dig>  and  <dig>  ml in the void volume, and gp <dig> was detected in the first peak fractions . maximum baculovirus titer was  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu  at the fraction  <dig> and the total number of recovered rbmnpv-hprr was  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu with recovery ratio of 100% . it suggested that there is no loss of bmnpv at this purification step. however the concentration of the virus was done by ultracentrifugation, and its recovery decreased by 30% . finally, rbmnpv-hprr was purified by 48-fold.

as an alternative column, sephacryl s- <dig> sf column chromatography was used for rbmnpv-hprr purification. sephacryl s- <dig> sf is optimized for the purification of dna, viruses and spherical particles up to  <dig> nm and its fraction range is from  <dig> ×  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> da. larval hemolymph was pretreated as mentioned above. seven ml of larval hemolymph  was applied to sephacryl s- <dig> sf column equilibrated with pbs. elution was performed by pbs and every  <dig> ml fraction was collected as shown in figure 3c. the first peak was observed between  <dig> and  <dig> ml, followed by the increasing second peak from elution volume of  <dig> ml. gp <dig> was detected in the first peak . the maximum baculovirus number was  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu in the fraction  <dig> , and total number of rbmnpv-hprr recovered was  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu. recovery yield of rbmnpv-hprr was 35%, and decreased to 4% by concentration via ultracentrifugation . rbmnpv-hprr was finally purified by 183-fold using sephacryl s- <dig> sf column chromatography. transfiguracion et al.  <cit>  reported that low recovery using sephacryl s- <dig> sf column chromatography and concentration by ultracentrifugation would be improved by the treatment of hemolymph with benzonase and buffer exchange during the purification steps involved.

proteins of rbmnpv-hprr purified by superdex  <dig> was analyzed by sds-page which showed two bands between  <dig> and  <dig> kda similar to hemolymph . however, when sephacryl s- <dig> was used, these two bands disappeared , resembling the pattern of protein bands found for rbmnpv-hprr purified from bm <dig> cell culture supernatant. major proteins between  <dig> and  <dig> kda, present in larval hemolymph, was removed completely. this shows that sephacryl s- <dig> holds a good performance in purification of the rbmnpv-hprr from silkworm larval hemolymph directly, without any contaminants.

purification efficiency of baculovirus from larval hemolymph harvested at different postinjection time
the baculovirus-infected silkworm larvae became black in color at  <dig> days p.i. and displayed wandering characteristics from  <dig> –  <dig> days p.i.. after this stage, they began to die. the larval hemolymph was harvested from rbmnpv-hprr-injected silkworm larvae  at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days p.i. it was then centrifuged, and filtered by  <dig>  μm membrane filter to remove insoluble materials. the final harvested volume at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days p.i. was  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ml, respectively. rbmnpv-hprr was purified from hemolymph corresponding to each day by sephacryl s- <dig> sf column chromatography . at  <dig> days p.i., the baculovirus concentration was  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml and protein concentration was  <dig>  mg/ml of hemolymph, which were the highest among the three hemolymph samples. at  <dig> days p.i., purified baculovirus number  was also the highest, but purification efficiency  was lower than that  of hemolymph at  <dig> days p.i.. the number of rbmnpv-hprr/mg protein was  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/mg at  <dig> days p.i., which was the purest among the three samples.

analysis of rbmnpv-hprr purified from hemolymph at  <dig> and  <dig> days post-injection
to confirm the expression of hprr on the surface of rbmnpv-hprr, western blot was carried out. the hprr was observed in purified rbmnpv-hprr at  <dig> days, but not at  <dig> days . forty two nanograms of hprr, by densitometry analysis, were obtained from  <dig> μg of purified rbmnpv-hprr at  <dig> days p.i.. quantity of rbmnpv-hprr per mg of protein decreased at  <dig> days compared to  <dig> days because of an increase of protein concentration in purified rbmnpv-hprr at  <dig> days.

to analyze proteins in each purified rbmnpv-hprr, sds-page was performed and the gel was stained with cbb . pattern of protein bands was not different between purified rbmnpv-hprr at  <dig> days and  <dig> days p.i.. this suggests that an increase of protein concentration in purified rbmnpv-hprr at  <dig> days p.i. was not due to the contamination of intracellular proteins in purified rbmnpv-hprr. ratio of gp <dig> , a major envelope protein, to vp <dig> , a major nucleocapsid protein increased at  <dig> days p.i. . two protein bands  also increased likely with an increase in gp <dig>  it was reported that these two bands, e and g, is the budded baculovirus-specific proteins  <cit> . this indicates that envelope proteins increase in rbmnpv-hprr as infection time passes.

when the purified rbmnpv-hprr particles from hemolymph were observed using transmission electron microscopy , it contained aberrant sized particles  at  <dig> days p.i. compared to that of  <dig> days p.i. . rbmnpv-hprr particles enclosed with thick envelopes also appeared. when thin-section tem was performed, thick envelopes around rbmnpv-hprr particles were observed too . moreover, envelope proteins in rbmnpv-hprr from hemolymph were increased at  <dig> days p.i.. this reveals that low purification efficiency of rbmnpv-hprr from hemolymph at  <dig> days p.i. might be due to thick envelope proteins formed around the rbmnpv-hprr particles.

discussion
q-pcr is applicable for the rapid titer determination of viruses like adenoviruses, retroviruses and acmnpv  <cit> . especially in the case of acmnpv, sybr green i was adopted for q-pcr and a correlation between titers determined by end-point dilution and q-pcr has been observed. however, in the case of bmnpv titer determination, the method was dependent only on conventional plaque assay and end-point dilution method only, until now. in this study, we established the q-pcr titer determination method for bmnpv. the melting point of amplified fragment from bmnpv dna was 82°c, but the melting point of amplified fragment from acmnpv dna was approximately 86°c. identity in dna sequence between the two fragments is  <dig> %. the difference between two melting points is supposed to result from the difference between the nucleotide sequences of the respective two fragments.

the baculovirus number from the hemolymph of a bmnpv bacmid-injected silkworm larva was  <dig>  ×  <dig> times higher than that of transfection solution in spite of usage of the same amount of bmnpv bacmid. baculovirus infection was not observed using transfection solution as baculovirus solution, indicating that it is difficult for the amount of rbmnpv-hprr in transfection solution to infect bm <dig> cells in normal condition due to a very small amount of baculovirus titer. this implies that many amplification steps are a prerequisite towards a successful infection of bm <dig> cells. it takes at least a month to amplify baculoviruses up to a sufficient titer. using hemolymph as a baculovirus stock to increase baculovirus titer can thus save time, cost and labor. in this report, the maximum baculovirus titer of hemolymph from bmnpv-infected silkworm larvae was found to be  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml.

sephacryl s- <dig> sf column is more appropriate for the purification of bmnpv from larval hemolymph than superdex  <dig> 10/ <dig> gl column, because of its efficiency in removal of contaminant proteins. in the case of purification of lily symptomless virus from fresh infected-tissues of lanzhou lily, sephadex- <dig> hr was superior to sephacryl s- <dig> method  <cit> . in this study, sephadex- <dig> hr also was found to be superior to sephacryl s- <dig> sf column chromatography in the baculovirus recovery, but purification yield was one-third to that with sephacryl s- <dig> sf column chromatography. turkey coronavirus was also purified by sephacryl s- <dig> sf column chromatography from intestines and intestinal contents of infected turkey embryos  <cit> .

several researchers have reported that bmnpv was purified from silkworm pupae by sucrose gradient centrifugation  <cit> . in the case of purification of bmnpv from silkworm larval hemolymph, this paper gives the first report using sec. quantity of rbmnpv-hprr per mg of protein decreased at  <dig> days p.i. compared to  <dig> days p.i.. however, protein-band pattern in purified rbmnpv-hprr at  <dig> and  <dig> days p.i. was similar; this denotes that there was no contamination in purified rbmnpv-hprr at  <dig> days p.i.. but proteins of which rbmnpv-hprr is composed of may increase at  <dig> days p.i.. in fact, purified rbmnpv-hprr from hemolymph at  <dig> days p.i. contained more envelope proteins than that at  <dig> days p.i.. moreover, hprr which is expressed in the envelope was observed at  <dig> days p.i., but not  <dig> days p.i. electron micrographs revealed that purified rbmnpv-hprr from hemolymph at  <dig> days p.i. possessed thick envelopes, resulting in low purification efficiency of rbmnpv-hprr from hemolymph at  <dig> days p.i.. the increase of envelope proteins in rbmnpv-hprr of larval hemolymph at  <dig> days p.i. was caused by thick envelopes around rbmnpv-hprr particles. besides, it was previously reported that increase of mutant virus, defective interfering baculoviruses , which lacks considerable parts of its genome, was observed during serial passage of acmnpv in insect cells  <cit>  and the large deletion of its genome may be caused by several hetero- and homologous recombination mechanism  <cit> . dis of bmnpv was also found in cultured cells  <cit> . dis might not be detected by q-pcr titer measurement method because of the large deletion of its genome, probably the loss of ie- <dig> gene. it is suggested that dis, which missed ie- <dig> gene, increased in hemolymph during bmnpv infection and therefore quantity of rbmnpv-hprr per mg of protein decreased at  <dig> day p.i.

CONCLUSIONS
the applicability of q-pcr for bmnpv titer determination was found successful in the current study. hemolymph from silkworm larva infected by rbmnpv  contains its titer in higher amount of bmnpv, even though 1: <dig> diluted hemolymph was injected to silkworm larva. moreover, a higher titer of rbmnpv-hprr solution  was obtained from silkworm larval hemolymph. purification of rbmnpv-hprr from silkworm larval hemolymph was successfully implemented by sephacryl s- <dig> sf column chromatography. the purified rbmnpv-hprr showed that the hprr was displayed on the surface of rbmnpv. this system allows a large-scale production and purification of rbmnpv displaying recombinant protein, which can be applicable for the functional analysis of receptors, drug delivery system and vaccines against infectious viruses and protozoa.
