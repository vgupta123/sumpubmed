BACKGROUND
several mosquito species of the anopheles genus are vectors of plasmodium parasites, the causal agents of malaria. this major vector-borne disease affects around  <dig> million individuals annually and leads to more than  <dig>  deaths, mainly in tropical and sub-tropical countries  <cit> . among approximately  <dig> anopheles species indexed worldwide  <cit> ,  <dig> species found in different regions around the world are considered to be the main vectors of the four plasmodium parasite species  responsible for human malaria  <cit> . an. funestus and two sister-species of the an. gambiae sensu lato  species complex  are primary vectors of p. falciparum malaria in sub-saharan africa  <cit> , where 80% of malaria mortality and morbidity occur  <cit> . among other anopheline vectors of medical importance, an. stephensi plays a prominent role in urban malaria transmission in the indo-pakistan subcontinent  <cit> , and both an. albimanus and an. darlingi are primary vectors of malaria in central america and various areas of south america  <cit> .

in the absence of a licensed malaria vaccine  <cit>  and while plasmodium drug resistance spreads across the world  <cit> , vector control is still the most effective method to protect people from arthropod-borne diseases  <cit> . prevention of arthropod infective bites can be achieved by personal protective measures and vector control strategies  <cit> . the evaluation of the effectiveness of these anti-vectorial measures is essentially based on entomological methods such as measuring the density of a mosquito species relative to human density  <cit> . catching human landing mosquitoes is currently the most reliable method to estimate host/vector contact  <cit> . entomological parameters are also a component of numerous indices used to monitor malaria transmission  <cit> . however, entomological methods for evaluating the risk of malaria transmission are mainly applicable to the population level and are poorly efficient at evaluating heterogeneity in exposure to vector bites among individuals due to considerable variation of exposure within small geographic areas  <cit>  or heterogeneity in socioeconomic and demographic factors . furthermore, the human landing catch method is labour-intensive, has budgetary and logistical constraints and is hampered by ethical limitations with the deliberate exposure of individuals to mosquito-borne pathogens. thus, alternative cost-effective and convenient methods need to be developed to assess human exposure to malaria vectors. during their blood meal, mosquitoes inject saliva into the host’s skin. this saliva contains a cocktail of active components that counteract host haemostasis and modulate immune responses to ensure blood meal success  <cit> . secreted salivary proteins of mosquitoes have been reported to elicit antibody responses in people living in endemic areas  <cit>  and among travellers transiently exposed to vector bites in tropical areas  <cit> . these antibody responses were described as being short lived and linked to the level of exposure  <cit> , highlighting the potential use of these responses to arthropod saliva antigens as immunological markers to evaluate individual exposure to arthropod bites  <cit>  or assess the impact of vector control interventions  <cit> . several studies demonstrated the presence of cross-reactive antibody responses against salivary proteins from different hematophagous arthropod species  <cit> . this cross-reactivity was attributed to the existence of antigens shared among different vector species  <cit> . species-specific antibody responses against salivary proteins from arthropods have repeatedly been reported  <cit> . thus, variable levels of homology between salivary protein sequences from different hematophagous arthropods could determine their specificity or cross-recognition  <cit> . recently, availability of the genome sequence of several arthropods of major health importance  <cit> , combined with transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of their salivary gland extracts   <cit>  have provided new insight into the diversity of salivary molecules among various hematophagous arthropods  <cit> . these studies revealed a number of secreted protein families, potentially involved in haematophagy or sugar digestion, that are ubiquitous in the nematocera suborder. completion of culex quinquefasciatus, aedes aegypti and anopheles gambiae genome sequences also led to the discovery of genus-specific salivary proteins  <cit> . for plasmodium spp. vectors, salivary gland transcriptomes and proteomes of an. gambiae   <cit> , an. stephensi   <cit> , an. funestus   <cit>  and an. darlingi   <cit>  have been examined to date, providing a thorough description of the salivary protein repertoire from these main malaria vectors throughout the world. notably, secreted salivary proteins were found to be more divergent than housekeeping proteins, indicating a rapid evolution of these proteins within the anopheles genus  <cit> . however, sialome diversity among these different anopheline species is poorly documented at the molecular and antigenic levels.

six anopheles species were selected according to their major role in human malaria parasite transmission . selection of these species was also motivated by the various degrees of phylogenetic relationships among them  and access to their sialomes via salivary gland dissection or through protein sequences obtained by conceptual translation of mrna sequences previously identified in sialotranscriptomic studies. importantly, few protein sequences are available for an. arabiensis and an. albimanus due to the lack of sialotranscriptomic studies conducted on these species. recently, assembly of transcriptional sequences derived from several body tissues including salivary glands of adult female an. albimanus was performed  <cit> . however, merging the sequence data from the different tissues into a single assembly did not allow clustering secreted salivary protein sequences from the others mosquito body parts, thereby restricting the number of available salivary protein sequences for this species. salivary gland protein  repertoires of these different anopheles species were compared in the present study using in silico analysis and proteomics approaches to assess their diversity at the molecular and protein levels. conceptual secreted salivary gland protein sequences retrieved from an ncbinr database of six anopheles species were clustered according to their level of amino acid identity to identify both conserved protein families throughout the anopheles genus and sub-genus- or species- specific salivary proteins. proteins contained in salivary gland extracts from four anopheles species were separated by 1-d sds-page and identified by tandem mass spectrometry . the antigenic diversity of sgps was also examined by immunoblot analysis. collectively, these data represent the first report of genus-, subgenus- and species-specific anopheles secreted salivary proteins. these proteins could be used for immunological evaluation of the exposure to anopheles bites.

RESULTS
phylogenetic relationships between selected anopheline species
six anopheles species  were selected based on their significance as major vectors of human malaria in different parts of the world. despite the availability of an an. albimanus transcriptome, protein sequences specifically matching secreted salivary gland proteins could not be identified in the whole body dataset  <cit> . this results from the hybrid nature of the transcriptome data from different tissues of adult female an. albimanus into a single transcriptome dataset, from which salivary gland-specific transcriptomic data have been excluded due to their low representation compared to other tissues. however, the sialome of four of the species  has been characterised by high-throughput sialotranscriptomic studies  <cit> . these six anopheles species were gathered in phylogenetically meaningful groups by analysing the degree of similarity of their cytochrome oxidase subunit ii  protein sequences   <cit> . alignment of the six protein sequences shows 100% identity between an. gambiae and an. arabiensis . the orthologous coii protein sequences from the others anopheles species are more divergent with  <dig> %,  <dig> %, 97% and  <dig> % identity for an. funestus, an. stephensi, an. albimanus and an. darlingi, respectively. a bootstrap consensus tree inferred from  <dig>  replicates showed that the six anopheles species are divided into the following two major groups based on their taxonomic classification:  a clade formed by an. gambiae, an. arabiensis, an. funestus and an. stephensi, which are all members of the cellia subgenus; and  a clade including an. albimanus and an. darlingi, which are two neotropical species belonging to the nyssorhynchus subgenus. the large cellia clade encompasses an. gambiae and an. arabiensis, which are two morphologically indistinguishable sibling species from the an. gambiae s.l. species complex. this phylogenetic analysis also indicated larger genetic distance between the an. gambiae s.l. , an. funestus  and an. stephensi  species.


comparison of secreted salivary protein sequences retrieved from public databases
a total of  <dig> salivary gland protein sequences from the six anopheles species were retrieved from public databases according to their annotation. focusing on proteins potentially injected into the human host during mosquito blood feeding, protein sequences were sorted based on signal peptide predictions  <cit> . a total of  <dig> out of these  <dig> salivary proteins, heterogeneously distributed among the six anopheles species , were predicted to harbor a secretory-signal peptide following submission to signalp server  <dig>  and were thus retained for further analysis. a pairwise protein-protein sequence comparison was first performed on these selected sgps using “blast  <dig> sequences”  <cit>  to find regions of local similarity between sequences from different anopheles taxa. briefly, secreted salivary protein sequences from each anopheles species were gathered into six different databases in accordance with their species affiliation. each protein from a database was then searched against all proteins from other database in a pairwise fashion. blast e-values were used as a parsing criterion in order to select best matches between two different salivary protein repertoires. in order to perform comparative analysis between salivary proteins repertoires, raw blast score obtained from the match of a query protein sequence with a targeted protein sequence were divided against raw self-blast score from the match of the query protein sequence to itself to obtain normalised blast scores . normalised blast scores range from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . the average normalised blast scores and average percentage identity between local alignments that estimate the degree of homology between salivary protein sequences from each pair of anopheles species are presented in figure 1c and additional file  <dig>  only protein sequences from each anopheles species matching at least one other salivary protein in another species at 40% identity  were considered in this analysis, representing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> protein sequences for an. gambiae, an. arabiensis, an. stephensi, an. albimanus, an. darlingi and an. funestus, respectively. the average normalised blast score between salivary protein sequences from an. gambiae and an. arabiensis was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . based on the same criteria, salivary protein sequences from both species from the nyssorhynchus subgenus had normalised blast scores of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and sequences from species belonging to the cellia subgenus had normalised blast scores larger than  <dig> . lower normalised blast scores were observed when comparing salivary protein sequences from species belonging to cellia with those of the nyssorhynchus subgenera  . thus, secreted salivary protein sequence similarities were the highest among closely related anopheline species and decreased with increasing phylogenetic distance .

hierarchical clustering of secreted protein sequences
hierarchical clustering of the salivary protein sequences was performed to determine paralogous  and orthologous  salivary proteins and their degrees of similarity among the six anopheles species. three clustering steps using the cd-hit program  <cit>  were sequentially performed at different similarity thresholds based on full-length sequences . this agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach was used to maximise the quality of clustering  <cit>  and produce a tree-like structure  to assess the level of homology among the proteins. among the  <dig> secreted salivary proteins that were retrieved, the first clustering step  led to the determination of  <dig>  non-redundant  protein sequences  and  <dig> clusters composed of at least two protein sequences  of the mean,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ). these  <dig> clusters were almost exclusively composed of paralogous sequences with the exception of five an. arabiensis protein sequences, which all clustered with an. gambiae sequences  and cluster  <dig> composed of an. stephensi and an. funestus  <dig>  kda proteins . the second clustering steps  identified  <dig>  nr protein sequences and  <dig> clusters . among these  <dig> clusters,  <dig> consisted of orthologous protein sequences. the vast majority of salivary protein sequences from species belonging to the nyssorhynchus subgenus did not cluster with those from the cellia subgenus at this step . the last clustering steps  resulted in  <dig>  nr protein sequences and  <dig> clusters . among these clusters,  <dig> were composed of orthologous protein sequences, half of which  consisted of sequences belonging to both nyssorhynchus and cellia subgenera. these orthologous sequences belong to several protein families, including the apyrase/5’nucleotidase, antigen 5/gvag, ge-rich/ <dig> kda, long and short form d <dig>  mucin/ <dig>  kda, sg <dig>  sg <dig>  sg <dig> or hypothetical  <dig>  kda protein families. among the nr sequences,  <dig> out of  <dig> ,  <dig> out of  <dig> ,  <dig> out of  <dig>  and  <dig> out of  <dig>  have no homologs in sialomes from other blood feeding arthropods, concerning an. gambiae, an. darlingi, an. stephensi and an. funestus, respectively. a majority of these species-specific secreted salivary proteins have low molecular weights .


analysis of salivary gland protein repertoires from four anopheles species
the salivary protein sequence repertoires available from public databases for both an. arabiensis and an. albimanus species are largely incomplete, and the vast majority of anopheles protein sequences are inferred from transcriptomic or genomic sequence analyses. thus, a proteomic analysis was performed to confirm the existence of predicted secreted proteins and evaluate the sequence diversity observed by in silico analysis at the protein level. access to sges could only be achieved for four of the six anopheles species by dissecting wild mosquitoes  or mosquitoes reared in laboratories . nonetheless, these four selected species are a representative sample of the anopheles taxonomic diversity at the subgenus, species complex and species levels. sgps of the four anopheles species were separated by sds-page . despite slight quantitative variations , superimposition of densitometric protein profiles indicated a high similarity between the an. gambiae and an. arabiensis species belonging to the an. gambiae s.l. species complex . conversely, sgp profiles of an. stephensi  and an. albimanus  differed and were highly distinct from an. gambiae s.l. profiles at the qualitative  and quantitative  levels.


to improve estimates of protein diversity, sgp repertoires from these four mosquito species were identified as previously described  <cit> . briefly, each gel loading track was cut into several segments covering the entire protein profile and proteins from gel pieces were identified by ms/ms. as scarce protein sequences are available in protein database for some of the anopheles species under study, the ms/ms spectra were searched against a non-redundant protein database including protein sequences from an. gambiae, an. arabiensis, an. stephensi and an. albimanus together. this strategy was implemented to identify homologous proteins among anopheles species based on their peptides similarities. a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins were identified in sges from an. gambiae, an. arabiensis, an. stephensi and an. albimanus, respectively, representing a total of  <dig> unique proteins for all species . among these  <dig> unique proteins,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were identified as putative secreted proteins in the sges of an. gambiae, an. arabiensis, an. stephensi and an. albimanus, respectively, totalling  <dig> unique putative secreted proteins for all species . only  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> salivary proteins were identified in an. gambiae, an. arabiensis, an. stephensi and an. albimanus, respectively. the majority of these proteins  were identified in the an. gambiae strain pest by homology. protein members from the apyrase and  <dig> kda/ge-rich/anti-platelet families were identified in all anopheles species. a total of  <dig> secreted proteins were only identified in unique anopheles species. the number of common proteins among the anopheles species was highest among closely related anopheline species  and decreased with increasing phylogenetic distance .


antigenic heterogeneity of anopheles salivary gland proteins
protein sequence diversity observed in in silico and proteomic analyses among the four anopheles species was also tested at the antigenic level. using a pool of sera from  <dig> senegalese individuals exposed mainly to an. gambiae s.l. and an. funestus <cit> , a comparison of igg antibody responses against sges from an. gambiae, an. arabiensis, an. stephensi and an. albimanus species was performed by immunoblot analysis. several antigenic bands were observed in sges of all anopheline species, with a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> antigenic bands detected in an. gambiae, an. arabiensis, an. stephensi and an. albimanus, respectively . the pooled sera exhibited high reactivity with three antigenic bands at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kda in sges from an. gambiae s.l., and all other antigenic bands detected in sges from an. gambiae were also found in those from an. arabiensis. however,  <dig> antigenic bands at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kda were exclusively observed in an. arabiensis sges . three antigenic bands with molecular weights of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kda were recognised in sges from species belonging to the cellia subgenus . however, the antigenic band with low molecular weight  was  <dig> -fold less intense in an. stephensi compared to those of the same molecular weight in an. gambiae s.l. with the same molecular weight criteria, two antigenic bands  were only detected in the an. stephensi sge antigenic profile. in an. albimanus sges, three antigenic bands were detected with molecular weights of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kda. among them, the more intense antigenic band  was  <dig> -fold less intense than its  <dig> kda counterpart detected in an. gambiae s.l. sges. interestingly, the  <dig> kda band was uniquely observed in an. albimanus, and the  <dig> kda antigenic band was faint but detected in all anopheles antigenic profiles. all protein bands numbered in figure 5c, corresponding to antigenic bands , were submitted to ms analysis for identification. with the exception of protein bands numbered  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,and  <dig>  at least one protein was identified in all excised protein bands, resulting in the identification of  <dig> distinct proteins  according to their ncbi accession numbers . as expected, several proteins could be identified in each excised band, and the same protein could also be identified in distinct excised bands from the same species as previously described  <cit> . some proteins, such as the salivary apyrase  and anophensin  were identified in antigenic bands from all species belonging to the cellia subgenus, including the non-african an. stephensi mosquito . orthologous proteins to an. gambiae s.l. antigens were identified in antigenic bands from the sges of an. albimanus, another non-african anopheles mosquito . interestingly, a ge-rich salivary gland protein  and a salivary gland protein  identified in an. stephensi and an. albimanus, respectively, shared  <dig> % and  <dig> % amino acid sequence identity with the anti-platelet protein  identified in the  <dig> kda antigenic band from the an. gambiae s.l. complex . these results highlight a potential link between protein sequence homology and the presence of cross-reactivity.

discussion
reduction in exposure to malaria vectors either by controlling anopheles density or avoiding their bites remains one of the most effective methods to protect human individuals from plasmodium infections  <cit> . however, to determine the effectiveness of individual or collective anti-vector measures, it would be useful to develop new indicators that can measure the kinetic variations of individual exposure to specific malaria vectors within a population. by eliciting an antibody response linked to the level of exposure, antibody responses to salivary antigenic proteins from malaria vectors were proposed as valuable immunological markers to estimate host/vector contact  <cit> . thus, the evaluation of the molecular diversity of salivary proteins from different anopheles species can be used as a proxy to select genus-, subgenus- and species-specific salivary candidates for subsequent evaluation as immunological markers for anopheles exposure  <cit> . the present study assessed the level of molecular and antigenic diversity and relatedness of secreted salivary proteins from major malaria vector species.

diversity of salivary protein among different species of the anopheles genus
vector species of the anopheles genus throughout the world have different levels of phylogenetic relatedness  <cit> . variation in the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit  <dig>  sequence has been widely used to display the phylogenetic relationships and population structure of anopheline mosquitoes  <cit> . molecular phylogenetic analysis using coii protein sequences from six selected malaria vectors  indicated that genetic distances between species were in agreement with their taxonomic classification. in addition, taking into account all of the secreted salivary proteins available from public databases for these six mosquito species, a pairwise protein-protein sequence analysis demonstrated that the proportion of salivary protein sequence homology decreases according to increasing phylogenetic distance between anopheles species. similar observations were reported for salivary proteins from phlebotomine sandflies  <cit> , underlining this diversity of salivary secreted proteins inside a hematophagous arthropod genus. comparative analyses of sialotranscriptomes between anopheles species highlighted that secreted salivary proteins are less conserved than housekeeping proteins  <cit> . heterogeneous secreted salivary protein repertoires among anopheles species are consistent with the existence of secreted salivary proteins occurring throughout the anopheles genus and others limited to the subgenus or species level.

genus-specific anopheline secreted proteins
despite the low number of sequences available for some anopheles species, several salivary protein families were found in all anopheles species tested using agglomerative hierarchical clustering. these protein families included the apyrase/5’nucleotidase, antigen 5/gvag, ge-rich/ <dig> kda, long and short form d <dig>  mucin/ <dig>  kda, sg <dig>  sg <dig>  sg <dig> or hypothetical  <dig>  kda protein families. at the protein level, the clustering of salivary secreted proteins identified by ms confirmed that some proteins, including proteins from the apyrase/5’nucleotidase and  <dig> kda/ge-rich/anti-platelet families, are present in all the investigated anopheles species. several of these protein families were also found in the saliva of other hematophagous arthropods, which could result from convergent evolution or a common ancestry  <cit> . for instance, members of the apyrase/5’nucleotidase and antigen 5/gvag protein families are found in the salivary glands of diverse hematophagous insect and tick species across the arthropoda phylum. interestingly, members from the ge-rich/ <dig> kda protein family are exclusively found in salivary glands of both culicine and anopheline female mosquitoes  <cit> . here, other protein families appeared to be exclusively found in saliva from anopheline mosquitoes, such as sg <dig>  sg <dig> or hypothetical  <dig>  kda proteins, offering the opportunity to use these proteins as genus-specific immunological markers. however, cross-reactivity is likely to occur when antigenic proteins share more than 70% amino acid identity  <cit> . most of these orthologous protein sequences belonging to the anopheles genus mostly shared less than 70% identity, minimising the probability of characterising conserved epitopes inside the anopheles genus  <cit> .

although an antigenic band was commonly detected at  <dig> kda in all anopheles species, ms did not identify common or orthologous secreted protein in these antigenic bands that could explain the observed cross-reactivity. the low protein abundance in the corresponding gel bands and incomplete molecular sequencing data for some of the anopheles species could explain this lack of identification. however, members of the ge-rich/ <dig> kda/anti-platelet family were identified in antigenic bands from the four anopheles species, and are thus potential candidates to serve as pan-anopheles genus markers of immunological exposure. complementary experiments are required to evaluate the lack of cross-reactivity against salivary proteins from other mosquito species from the culicidae family. interestingly, in cases of human allergic reactions involving the production of ige antibodies in response to mosquito bites, some salivary allergens from aedes aegypti mosquito species have been characterized  <cit> . among aedes aegypti salivary allergens tested, recombinant forms of the  <dig> kda salivary apyrase, the 37-kda protein belonging to the d <dig> family and the  <dig> kda salivary gland allergen were demonstrated to elicit an ige responses in mosquito-allergic individuals. these data underline the antigenicity of some salivary proteins including  <dig> kda family members, and the opportunity to use such proteins for the diagnosis and the desensitisation of mosquito allergic individuals.

subgenus-specific anopheline secreted salivary proteins
combinations of subgenus-specific immunological markers may be an alternative for assessing exposure to anopheles bites. moreover, such markers could be helpful in identifying the anopheline subgenus involved in malaria transmission in places where several vector subgenera with different behaviour and vectorial capacity are encountered within the same area, notably in asia  <cit> . in silico analysis of secreted salivary protein sequences from the six anopheles species tested in the present study indicated that secreted salivary proteins sharing between 70% and 90% amino acid sequence identity are mainly clustered according to their subgenus affiliation. thus, several salivary secreted proteins, such as trio, gsg <dig>  gsg <dig> proteins and numerous hypothetical proteins with low molecular weights , clustered only in the cellia subgenus. the same observation was made for the nyssorhynchus subgenus . some of the secreted salivary proteins identified by ms were uniquely detected in the anopheles species belonging to the cellia subgenus, such as salivary apyrase, anophensin, d <dig> proteins or trio proteins. in silico analysis revealed that members of the gsg <dig> and gsg <dig> protein families are well conserved inside the cellia subgenus with at least 67% and 77% identity, respectively, among an. gambiae, an. funestus and an. stephensi. among these two protein families, an. gambiae gsg <dig>  which is a reliable marker for exposure to an. gambiae <cit>  bites, was recently reported to be a good indicator for exposure to bites from three main african malaria vectors from cellia sb. . this cross-recognition could result from shared epitopes among these orthologous sg <dig> proteins  <cit> . according to their low molecular weights , gsg <dig> and gsg <dig> proteins should be contained in the large  <dig> kda antigenic band detected in the cellia subgenus. however, ms did not identify these last two proteins. description of the salivary gland protein repertoire from an. gambiae performed by kalume and colleagues identified gsg <dig> proteins only using a gel-free approach  <cit> . thus, unsuccessful identification of these small proteins could be attributed to the combination of a high number of salivary proteins of this molecular weight and a low number of ms spectra generated by these small proteins, rendering this complex protein mixture unidentifiable by ms. the application of gel-free proteomic methods might increase salivary proteome coverage, especially concerning secreted protein with low molecular weights  <cit> . as orthologous secreted salivary proteins belonging to the same subgenus clustered only at important sequence identity levels, shared-epitopes are likely to occur, increasing the likelihood of observing cross-reactivity among these subgenus-specific proteins. thus, identification of apyrase, anophensin and trio orthologs in antigenic bands from an. gambiae s.l. and an. stephensi sges highlight the potential of these salivary proteins to be cellia subgenus-specific immunological markers.

species complex-specific anopheline secreted salivary proteins
the anopheles subgenera encompass several groups of closely related species that are morphologically indistinguishable, such as the an. gambiae s.l. species complex, which includes at least  <dig> species  <cit> . in silico analysis revealed a high degree of homology  among salivary protein sequences from each selected mosquito of this complex . moreover, protein profiles and protein repertoires were highly similar between these two closely related anopheles species, although one was collected in the field  and the other came from continuous laboratory rearing . these results point to the likelihood that salivary protein candidates from either of these species would be able to assess exposure to anopheles mosquitoes pertaining to the an. gambiae s.l. species complex. using pooled sera from individuals mainly exposed to an. gambiae, an. arabiensis and an. funestus <cit> , most intense antigenic bands  were revealed in sges from both species, suggesting that strong antibody responses against an. gambiae s.l. sges are elicited following exposure to these mosquitoes. indeed, in a recent study conducted in the south of france, a positive association between mosquito exposure and the level of antibody response was reported and this immunological response appeared to be species-specific  <cit> . the major antigenic bands observed in an. stephensi and an. albimanus sges were about 4-fold less intense than the most intense antigenic bands detected in an. gambiae s.l. sges. potential common antigenic salivary proteins were identified in major antigenic bands from an. gambiae and an. arabiensis salivary gland protein profiles, including anti-platelets, anophensin and proteins from the d <dig> and sg <dig> families. even if members of these protein families are present throughout the cellia subgenus, low amino acid sequence identities can occur between an. gambiae s.l. and other species, which could drastically affect antibody binding. cross-reactivity usually implies a lower affinity for the cross-reactive antigen compared to the primary antigen  <cit> . the development of better quantitative methods, such as elisa or luminex®, combined with the production of salivary antigenic protein candidates may provide more distinct antibody responses to specific mosquito bites from the cross-reactivity attributed to partial shared-antigens.

species-specific anopheline secreted salivary proteins
it would be interesting to use immunological tools to assess individual exposure to a specific anopheles species, even to closely related phylogenetically species, in areas harbouring several anopheles species with distinct vector competences and behaviours. for instance, the an. gambiae s.l. complex encompasses species that often occur in sympatry but profoundly differ in their ability to transmit malaria parasites, in host feeding preferences, larval habitat requirements or responses to select vector control measures  <cit> . thus, characterisation of anopheles species-specific immunological markers may help to implement adapted vector-control strategies and assess their efficiency to prevent host/vector contact at the individual level. additionally, the combination of different species-specific immunological markers using multiplex techniques, such as luminex®  <cit> , may increase sensitivity  <cit>  and specificity of the test. such multiplexing of validated antigenic salivary proteins will distinguish exposure to the bite of malaria vectors from that of non-vector anopheles. species-specific immunological markers may provide a more detailed view of the history of exposure at an individual level in retrospective studies. thus, these markers may be useful to determine the implication of different vector species in malaria epidemics. in silico analysis indicated that  <dig>  salivary proteins have no orthologous proteins in other anopheles species at the lowest amino acid sequence identity threshold tested . in addition, ms only identified  <dig> secreted in unique anopheles species. some of these species-specific salivary proteins, including mainly proteins with low molecular weights, are not found in sges from other hematophagous arthropod species . thus, these can serve as potential immunological markers for the assessment of individual exposure to specific anopheles species.

although in silico analysis, protein patterns and protein repertoires indicated a low diversity of secreted salivary proteins between an. gambiae and an. arabiensis, the detection of three antigenic bands exclusively in an. arabiensis sges suggest that closely related species could be distinct at the antigenic level. unfortunately, ms analysis could not successfully identify the corresponding proteins from the gel bands. to identify these antigenic bands, a two-dimensional immunoproteomic approach using a fluorescence-based method could be an alternative  <cit> . although the challenge appears more important for closely related mosquito species, our data suggest that identification of species-specific immunological markers seems reasonably conceivable. moreover, this hypothesis is supported by our recent work on the existence of species-specific serological responses against ae. caspius sges  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present study assessed, for the first time, the sialome diversity among different anopheles species at the molecular and antigenic levels by combining in silico, proteomic and immuno-proteomic approaches. our results demonstrate that salivary protein sequence identities among different species from one culicidae genus are heterogeneous, with salivary proteins present throughout the anopheles genus, or specific at the subgenus or species levels. this result demonstrates that salivary proteins from closely related species exhibit molecular diversity despite their common pharmacological activities . this work supports the idea that genus-, subgenus- and species-specific salivary proteins can be used to develop immunological markers of individual exposure to malaria vectors. in complement to entomological methods, such immunological markers of exposure may be useful in the evaluation of anti-vector intervention strategies. in addition, development of species-specific immunological markers may help determine the implication of different vector species in malaria epidemics and provide further understanding of the vectorial system in a given area.
